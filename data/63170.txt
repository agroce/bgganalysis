RATING: 10
After my first game - an epic 6p, 11 hour journey - this game lodged itself in my brain with an insistence I haven't encountered for years, possibly ever. 

Despite being a player who enjoys a 'find an interesting lever and pull it' playstyle, I was utterly bewildered by the array of levers on offer and in particular decided against shorting anything for the first game so that I could see the ramifications when other people did so.

I feel this one in particular maintains its interest throughout, unlike other 18xx I've tried which have a tendency to spend an hour just running their course in the lategame. Perhaps that's due to inexperience, but this title bucked that trend from the get-go. 

A phenomenal game which may unfortunately be doomed to a once/twice a year affair due to its length and weight, but one I will jump at the chance to play where possible.

Highly focused stock manipulation game with short selling, ultimately I think the short selling makes or breaks the game for those involved, either destroying the shorted company and owning player with profits all round for the others or the company ends up surviving, paying out 60% to the president and over 100% to the company and they go on to win easily. Would be willing to play more as it has a lot of nice subtleties to explore.

This game is like that 15-course dinner you have on your bucket list. It's obscenely ostentatious, but it's also one of the best meals you've ever had. I was already grappling with the strategic possibilities of 18xx, and this game opened it up in several dimensions and had me stare in and I'm still recovering from the vertigo.

As of 1 March 2011 after one play with 6:

This is a heavily financial 18xx game with several options for funding companies. The most straightforward way to raise capital is for companies to take the loans kindly provided by the Bank of New York. These loans start out a great deal but can rather quickly become a burden, since the interest rate is set based on the total number of loans taken by all companies. This mechanic is a lot like 1856 with teeth: the interest rate is usually higher than 10% and there is no government railroad to take liabilities off of your hands. The net effect seems to be that there is a lot more withholding (or half-paying) in the early game as companies struggle to both cope with loan interest and pay their directors enough money to start further companies.

The next key difference is the ability to short-sell shares. This allows you to sell a share that you do not own (and get paid for it), with the caveat that you now possess a negative share, i.e. when dividends are paid you must pay out of personal cash. This can be very powerful when done correctly: companies that are overvalued become a source of cash for the rest of the table.  Simply shorting companies to tank their stock value does not look viable, provided that these companies have routes and trains.

The final set of differences involve the ways that companies can acquire the assets of other companies (i.e. trains, tokens, and potentially cash and loans). Companies can merge, be acquired by other companies, or be liquidated if they cannot raise sufficient capital to continue.

I enjoyed the game, though I would like to try a full game at some point. Playing the game involves a lot of calculation, as you often need to plan out your interest payments for the next couple of turns, or decide if it is worth taking more loans to buy another train. This is not a good game for the inexperienced. I worry also that it is a much longer game when played for the first time, as it is not necessarily clear how to exploit the financial system to get through the train roster quickly.

I'm on the fence about buying a copy when it is released, as it's quite long and I suspect will be quite expensive. The game contains somewhere around 180 tokens and 500 shares, and it's not clear how to avoid this, since companies can merge in arbitrary ways. Perhaps putting a limit on the number of 5-and 10-share companies would help reduce component cost, but I don't know how this would affect play. (I can't really see there being room for all 20 companies to be 10-share companies though.)

RATING: 8
If you thought regular 18xx was brutal, try short selling someone else's company.  It's not so bad after you learn how to deal with the shorts, but it takes some getting used to.  

There are so many companies, prepare for the board to get very crowded with tokens.  With a 6 player game we've had all 20 companies in play at once.  With 20 different sets of tokens it can be hard to differentiate them.

Operating rounds can take forever due to the number of companies out there and all the tokens can block a lot of the board.  6 player learning game took 7 hours and we didn't finish.  My second 6 player game took 9 hours, and I was forced into bankruptcy near the end when I should have merged my companies and didn't.

RATING: 9
Pretty impressed with it after one play. The main novelty draw are the financial shenanigans, which seem interesting, although I admit I don't fully grasp how to use them, and still can't see much interest in shorting except in very specific situations - in our game both players who used it ended up not being able to close one of the short positions. But I enjoyed the board play a lot as well, the map is interesting and plays well with the private companies' powers and the way tokens are handled. The different dynamic of the 2, 5 and 10 share companies also spices things up and allows a lot of varied strategies.

I wonder how it would play with the kind of dividend dependent capitalization rules of Baltimore&Ohio, rather than the typical 18xx ones.

UPDATE: [6.24.16] Play updated.  1 F2F; 4PbeM.  The game continues to be a wonderful puzzle of how to best finance your companies and then make the money.  

[10.15.15] - I already think 18xx is addictive, but no matter the outcome of when I play 1817, I think about it longer and harder than most of the other titles.  This game really gives you the feeling that you're in control of what is going on with your money, which creates the engaging lure for the game.  At the same time, the game also allows you to be harshly punished if you put any of your companies into a weak financial position.  Your opponents will go after you and short your company into the ground.  Tied for my favorite 18xx title with 1862/EA.

[3.2.2015] - Played once.  Showed zero loan discipline.  Went from a $7xx net worth to $3xx in one stock round.  Went Bankrupt by MA3.1  Brain was tied in knots.    Unlike any other 18xx game I've played so far.  I love the depth and enigmatic nature of the financial side of this game.  Crazy awesome game design for not only an 18xx game, but also for any game out there.  If you're looking for a truly satisfying economic, stock market/stock manipulation, share holding game, this one is King.

This game seems to fill two gaps in my 18xx collection. First it is a longish game, advertised to clock in at 6 hours. Second it has a much deeper financial structure than any 18xx variant I've seen (or even heard of). The rules are well written, which is not always the case in the 18xx world. 

UPDATE:
After 4 full plays now this title has firmly planted itself as my favorite 18xx game.

Short selling adds a very nice tension to the already complex financial situation. In my latest game there were very few shorts, but each one had significant impact.

By the way my win-loss record is 0-4. 

Can't wait to play it again!

UPDATE:
I now have a dozen or more full plays of this game (and finally a few wins) and I find that it is now the ONLY game I really want to play. It's a shame that I rarely find enough players with sufficient available time.

That said, I don't think this game is for everybody. It can be brutally cut-throat and mistakes can be punished most harshly, sometimes even ending in bankruptcy. This game forces you to stay alert.

1817 also forces veteran 18xx players to fundamentally rethink the way they operate companies. Some of my friends have objected mildly to be treated as utter newbies, until they see how short-selling can be used to awesome effect when a director runs up his share price as per usual practice in other 18xx titles.

There's a reason this game is named after the opening of the NY Stock Exchange.  It's a nasty game that is far more concerned with making money than running railroads.  Open as many as you can, rape them and then pass them on.  Oh, and don't forget to rape other's people's companies while trying to protect yourself from being raped.  Oh, did I mention this is a mean and nasty game?

I played at least 50 games before I started logging plays.  The local group has over 300 right now.  The meta keeps changing.  If you could only have one game, limitless time, and a dedicated game group, this might be the one.   

Sent the following to friends, adding here for prosperity:
Rebecca:
I've heard there's a new PBEM 1817 game, so I jotted down (using my phone) some common starts and initial auction info.

You don't need to win a private in 5P to start two companies.

Privates go for around 75% of face value, except for Steel Mill which ranges from $40-$50. 

Mail contracts don't pay until OR1b.

Which privates you win, and your total bidding power, for the most part, determines your best starting locations.  The below is general advice for 5P.

Pittsburgh would like two coal, one pointing to Philly and the other to Charleston.  Don't outbid the Pitts Steel Mill private owner out of the location; it's worse for the winner of Pittsburgh not to be a "B" tile than the person who won the Steel Mill and never plays it.  The Steel Mill "B" tile can be placed/teleported by a front running company.

Charleston would like one bridge and three coal, look at my final game board pics for the standard build,  it has a scripted start.  The bridge private can be in another company and the bonus(es)required teleported in.  There usually are two players well suited to start here and so be prepared to bid high.  Needs money for double tile lays and would be happy to own Mountain Engineers, especially for $25.

Baltimore is our most desired starting location but be wary of being cut off by Philly to SNY. 

NNY & Albany is a safe start.  NNY would like to break out with a token in Albany.  This start nearly guarantees Boston won't be a contested location for new companies in early stock rounds.

Double Cleveland (one player starting two companies in Cleveland) can race to and token Charleston. Cleveland always tries for the Pittsburgh token.   When floating, keep cash for double lays and the $10 hex cost to Pittsburgh. A popular tactic in double Cleveland is to operate back to back, be on the bottom of the stock chart, and break 3Ts with front company and token with second.   That either requires both growing up, or the first growing or buying a 3T with a withold (rare, do the maths) and second owning the Station private. Good to go into SR with cash to "defend" ownership with purchase of a share to 60%.  A fancy maneuver is to make a company undesirable and enter acquisition.  Sure - another player takeover your five loans and a Cleveland token!  

If sharing Cleveland, to run two trains build to Pitts and Chicago.  It may not be possible to run two trains in OR1b without cooperation.

Less desirable spots:

Richmond - Dreams of a Baltimore token.  Can run two trains with a $20 tile lay that Baltimore probably won't pay for. 

Cincinnati - Not bad with a bridge private and ability to token Charleston.  Be wary of double Cleveland shenanigans.

Philadelphia - SNY and Baltimore want to connect to eachother and block Philly out.  Have a plan for running trains.

SNY - usually has a high par price and will only run one 2T OR1b, if not shut out by a Baltimore/Philly player.  Avoid loans in OR1a to be set up to buy as many 2+T as possible.

Detroit - Starts with all cash, $100 works.  Runs one 2T train, stays a 2 share, money pumps, and liquidates.  Or not.  Works well if stretching to win bid for Baltimore or Charleston is required.

Has great depth with many financial options.  I like how you can take a loan whenever you want, but that the interest rate is variable, and usually will be near to or higher than the profit you'll make from the train, because of the "threshold effects" where taking a loan lets you spend the rest of your corporation's treasury.

Based on one game, the short selling mechanic is excellent but the underlying game is way too complicated.  There are three sizes of companies, conversions between sizes, loans, two subtly different merger mechanics, and three different sorts of acquisitions.  It strikes me as a game for accountants.

Radical departure from the usual 18xx design. Interesting ideas around managing growth of companies and mergers that I did not fully understand in my first play. OK: that I did not understand at all.

Less taken with all of the standard auctions when trying to found a corporations. Also with the lack of geometry associated with specific corporations although the permanence of tokens does drive the game down a real network-oriented path.

Want to try again. Difficult to get to the table because of game length and the fact that the locals are all sharks and I am at best a guppy.

Perhaps one of my favorite 18XX, with a heavy emphasis on the stock market end of things over the track laying/train running. Lots of possibilities for player screwage but while short selling might sound like a good idea, you need to be really careful as to when you do this. Lots still to learn before i can play this at the highest level, but really looking forward to playing again.

I have played 1817 around 10 times during the play-testing kit process with the Chicago Games-Plus group.  It has now become my favorite 18xx, and definite contender for personal best game.  The additional elements of open starting, short selling, merging / converting are implemented very well.  NOTE: final play rules version has 5 short sell certificates.  I play only with 10 short sell certificates of each company.  The group I play with is brutal (honed the kill-shot and suggested the 'fix' to it that are in final rules).  There are definitely tactics to avoid a massive short sell from 'hurting'.  Realistically, the traditional valuation of companies needs a new 1817 calculus, which improves the game after a 2-3 game learning curve.  The realization easily spreads to other 18xx games and makes valuations there much faster as well.

RATING: 7
I have played 1817 three times.  It's a reasonably simple game as far as the rules are concerned; almost everything works logically.  There's no limit to the number of track tiles available and no limit to the money in the bank.  However, it does seem to be a longish game (it took us 6 hours with 4 and 7 hours with 5 fast players,) and the question is whether it's good enough to justify the time it takes.  I've found it to be a bit of a struggle to get people to play it.

Most 18XX titles have leverage together with a penalty for over-using leverage.  In 1830, the leverage is the ability to get 100% of the par price into a company by spending 60%, plus the ability to sell privates in at double the list price.  The penalty is the obligation to buy a permanent train for each company.

In 1817, there is a form of leverage available to the company (loans) and a different form available to the player (short sales.)  Each of these forms of leverage has a corresponding penalty (the president's obligation to make sure interest is paid, and in some cases to pay back loans, and the player's obligation to pay dividends on short shares, and in some cases to buy back short shares.)  I find these forms of leverage and penalties logically appealing (why should the president have to buy a company a train, anyway?)

I also like the fact that you must guard against an over-valued stock.  The need to keep the stock price at least somewhat matched to the intrinsic value is a neat feature, as opposed to many 18XX games in which you try to drive the stock price as high as you can (in some titles, with steady but small dividend payments.)

Perhaps the harshest and by far the least forgiving 18xx I've ever played.  It's got a lot of unique mechanics compared to the usual 18xx fare, and the Stock market, train rush, and tokening is horifically agressive.  It's a great experience though, and one I'd like to repeat.

It's a rare occurrence to find a game that one could legitimately regard as a "lifestyle" game. While the 18xx genre as a whole is often a lifestyle pursuit, I've not yet come across an instance that could stand on its own -- but 1817 fits that mold to a T. There is so much going on in this game and the resultant interactions so deep and far-reaching that it might actually take a lifetime to explore its nuances. I suppose that the same could be said about many 18XX games (e.g. 1830, 1841, and 1837), but its seems that 1817 outstrips them all. Granted I have but a single play under my belt, but for around 12 hours the game unfolded in front of me and hinted at the depths therein. Having said all of this, I'm not ready to make 1817 one of my life-style games yet. Between Go and Shogi, my lifestyle pursuits are filled, but wow is 1817 an incredibly brilliant game.

Truly an amazing design. Weighty, interesting, and difficult decisions await at practically every turn, and the game lets you turn up the pressure on your opponents at almost any time... but for a price. And whether that price is worth it or not can be very hard to determine indeed. There are a lot of 18XX games I enjoy, but this one is just fantastic. Probably very difficult to play with any regularity (as I can easily see a game with experienced players going 7-8 hours), but most definitely worth the effort of organizing.

When asked to explain 18xx, I often say: "It's a wargame played with money". Using this analogy, then in most 18xx games you can think of yourself as being armed with a small pocket knife and must make your opponents die the death of the thousand cuts, as the damage you can do with a single action is strictly limited. 1817, by contrast, is 18xx played with a baseball bat.
The McGuffin here is short selling. Ignore the baloney in the rules about this being triggered by a mismatch between book value and market capitalisation. It's the need to make substantial borrowings that makes a company a short target, usually because its trains are about to rust. Time this wrong and the game will severely cane you for your mistake. The swing can be huge and most likely game deciding. However, it's also easy to counteract, just take out your loans before the stock round, rather than afterwards and short sellers will never bother you again. Once shorting is neutralised as a tactic, then 1817 devolves into a rather sedate slow-and-steady-wins-the-race type of game and that really is my problem with it. 
1817 is a very innovative take on the 18xx system. It's long and utterly unforgiving, but short selling is a VERY blunt instrument in a game with high dividends. This is also a game so focussed on financial manipulation that route building is bordering on irrelevance. I prefer more subtlety.

One of my favorite 18xx games, thanks to the wide variety of different shenanigans that are possible. I wonder a bit about how large the strategic space really is (i.e. how much of the game is simply about maneuvering for share density in the final rounds by spending the early game artificially pumping up 2- or 5-share companies with friendly acquisitions).

But no matter what, my first play of 1817 is one of my most memorable gaming moments. A massive economic crisis caused by the combined greed of all players wiped out 2 out of 5 players (the only experienced ones) and left one more (me) crippled. Observing the behavior changes as various players realized that the shit was about to hit the fan was just awesome.

RATING: 7
Rating is based on 1 play. I liked the idea of short sales and dynamic loan interest. However, there were several things which I wasn't very fond of:
* Share prices are incredibly easy to manipulate because you can take loans at almost any point
* You cannot own more than 1 share of an opponent company because everybody has multiple companies and you'll always end up with a trainless company full of loans if you do the wrong thing. For this reason you cannot really play the game as an investor and so you end up making own companies, which makes the game slow because there are 10-20 companies in the game in each opearting round
* There are lots of special rules with acquisition, liquidation, 2-share, 5-share, 10-share companies, etc. Maybe there's a bit too much to swallow in the mix.
* 2-share and 5-share companies are kinda boring. For me it often seemed that during stock there was nothing to buy so I need to found a new company yet again.
* There are so many trains that the game seems to take forever. I'd probably enjoy more aggressive game with less trains

1817 is the greatest game that I've played that uses the 18xx game system. It rewards good financial decisions as it is generally very strong to buy as many of a new type of train as you can afford and run a route for. What makes this game brilliant is all of the different ways to financially manage the game. The depth of the financial manipulation is much greater than any other game in the 18xx genre, 1830 included. You can always raise the funds to do what you want, but doing so may kill you, either from loan interest or from paying dividends on shorted shares. Unlike other 18xx games, managing the actual value of a stock is a key strategic component, rather than a simple decision of pushing it as high as possible or 'into the brown' as in some games. Having a high-valued company makes it easier to reinvest in a company while simultaneously making you the target of short sales which others could use to raise the money to either rust your trains or drive up interest to the point where your company doesn't look so healthy anymore. Having a low valued company makes it harder to take loans without falling into acquisition, but makes it easier to threaten to fold the company if too many shares are bought. You ideally want the company's stock value to reflect the strength of the company (until the financially secure end-game in reached, when everyone wants as high a value as possible). A high-valued weak company will be shorted to death, profiting your opponents on the way down, whereas a low-valued strong company will immediately have its shares bought up for prices that don't justify the loss of the company owned shares (of course, depending on the president's other ventures, these shareholders may have to worry about him moving his assets elsewhere and letting their shares liquidate for almost no value). Whether to start a new 2 share company or a new 5 share company, whether to strengthen one company or another, to try to leverage money by putting it into your hand or to withhold either to pay off loans or to buy trains, or just to snub your shareholders, whether to merge a failing company with a healthy one or to let it fail either to consolidate it with another company or to just let it die and go to the highest bidder. Each of these decisions contribute to the astonishing depth of the financial aspects of the game.

1817 plays surprisingly well at a variety of player counts. After probably 60-80 plays, I would say that the game plays well at 3, 4, 5, and 6 players. My personal preference is currently 4-player followed by 5, 6, and 3 in roughly that order. I would not recommend this game with more than 6 players, the only reason being that I believe the game to drag with more players and 7 is about where it would start getting too painful for me to not prefer simply splitting into a 3-p and a 4-p game (Assuming of course that you have access to two copies of 1817. Otherwise have at your 7-p).

There is one game variation that is worth mentioning. The official rules play with a maximum of 5 shorts per company (5- or 10-share), with the option to play with 10 shorts available in 10-share companies as a rules variant. I'm convinced that the 10-short version is always the right way to play. It has some subtle and some not so subtle impact on how players need to treat 10-share companies, and I've found that certain strategies are more abusable in the 5-short version that are made more even in the 10-short version. It does however also mean that growing up to a 10-share company requires slightly more care and caution.

I'd like to play this before I officially preorder it from Scott. It seems like it might be a mean one, but the ratings for this game are outstanding.

It's a bit on the pricey side, but it seems like it would be worth it.

A top 18xx game for both innovation and gameplay.

interesting version of 18xx. It's a weird combo of 1829 (stock prices goes up based on dividend size), 1830 (stock prices changed based on dividend offered) and loans borrowed or paid off. Merging/Upgrading reminds me of 18OE. Tiny map is good. Still have not figured out how to short.

Brilliant heavy-weight 18xx. The stock market is more lively than in most other games, and the track-building part goes quickly thanks to the simplified tiles and massive number of tokens quickly filling up the empty spaces.

One game, seven players, seven hours. I didn't particularly enjoy the game because of the downtime with so many players. I'd like to try again with four. Perhaps we'll be less cautious and abuse the financial tools in the game more ... 

Other than short selling, things that make 1817 different: 

Taking loans from the variable rate loan market feels like playing another stock market game, as interest can get very expensive. We should have been less wary of taking out lots of loans, but I don't think we found loopholes to manage the frequently huge interest payments.

The "minor" 2- and 5-share companies have the same train limits as "major" 10-share companies, which make the minors very valuable -- so valuable that it seems that converting a minor to a major felt like a survival tactic than a strategic choice.

There is no financial loss when you purchase a private company; its value can be used as cash when staring your first corporation.

The map is really, really bland. No bottlenecks on the board, nor are there any ridiculously high priced cities. There are no towns on the board! Towns are replaced with bridge and mine tokens (both of which come with certain privates). These tokens are placed on yellow tiles; those tiles cannot be upgrade for the rest of the game. However, perhaps the map is intentionally bland because most of the cities become filled with tokens fast.

Whenever you want to start a corporation, you first place its first token on the board. Then that corporation is auctioned off. In our game, there was never any competition in these auctions, as most players had (a) no capital to start a corporations or (b) had other plans for their capital.

Presidents of corporations do not have to ensure that their corporations have trains. If they don't, it gets liquidated. Presidents do have to pay interest on their loans, though. We didn't take advantage of this tactic, of abandoning a corporation to liquidation.

=========

What I thought of the game? Ambivalent. I was hoping that the main feature of the game, short selling, would give some game-changing, strategic drama like the formation of the CGR in 1856. Instead, in our game, it gave players successful in shorting a small financial boost that enabled their strategies to run a turn or two faster -- nothing that dramatic.

Perhaps it's because we weren't abusing the system enough, which would put us in more precarious situations, which in turn would increase the tendency of other players to short each other. However, this game has a lot of safer financial tools to help players get out of bad situations.

It definitely needs another play. Strategically, still, it seems like the best tactic is to open as many corporations as possible.

This may become one of my favorite 18xx titles. 1830 is my all time favorite right now, but there are so many things in that game that are added or changed from how the world works in order for the game to work properly.  1817, however, has the ebb and flow of reality flowing through the rhythm of the game.  I will have to play this one a few more times before I actually let it ascend to a ten.

Update: After a second play:  I really like this game, but a troubling thing occurred in the game we last played.  There was a company that was hitting Chicago to New York with a four train, had a very good share price, and had enough money to buy a permanent train in the company.  The president only owned one company and could not screw with the money or trains.  One player decided that he wanted to try shorting his share. If he was the only player to short, he would have lost big, but once the "blood was in the water", every other player decided to short or sell all of their shares.  The result, a company that should have been bought out and run the rest of the game ended up in receivership in one turn.  I am still uncertain as to whether this is the optimal play, but the effect is devastating to the player.

One of my favorites! This game has all the nastiness of 1830 and adds the viciousness of the shorting mechanism. "Don't take it personally, but your company is overvalued and I am going to profit from it;" or, "Player 1 just shorted company A... I guess I will drive it to the ground too."

Tons of changing group-think, many of ways to make money; the only drawback is the 7+ hours it takes to play.

Astonishing game in depth and planning. My favorite 18XX game and one of the best games ever made. I strongly recommend the 10-share/10-short version. Caveat: Do NOT learn the 18XX system with this game.

Wow!  This system turns everything you knew about 18xx games on its head.  There are so many major changes to the system that you can't just take it for granted that you are going to be able to sit down and get this right off the bat.  It takes a learning game just to understand how everything works together.  Very nuanced. Lots of cool stuff. This is good for the 18xx'er that wanted to justify a new purchase, but knew that it wasn't going to be worth it to just get yet another version of the same game.

Nearly flawless.  1817 is even nastier and more unforgiving than 1830.  It's also a lot more complex.  Beware of the increasingly usurious interest payments.  You need loans to buy trains and keep your stock price in check, but they can bankrupt you if you're not careful.  I've also learned to beware of short selling stock.  It can be a source of cheap cash, but it can come back to bite you if you short the wrong company or if you can't cover the short when you need to.  But as with loans, properly used, shorting is a useful way to drag down the stock price of overvalued companies closer to the proper price.

Unfortunately, 1817 is the longest 18xx I've played, and the length is a practical limitation on replayability.  Expect to spend an entire day playing.  Even then you might not finish.  The last third of the game is less interesting than the first two.  But despite this, the game more than justifies its length, and it is easily my favourite all-day game.

This game is amazing. It has what I sought after in an 18xx game. My favourite of all time. The rules are simple but the possibilities are so enormous.

The things I like about 18xx games are all here:

1. Partial capitlization of companies.
2. A fierce stock market but does not go crazy when you sell shares (share price only drops if it remained in the open market at the end of the stock round - I really like this)
3. A deceptively simple but very fierce map. 
4. The conversions, mergers, acquisitions - wow!! every decision matters and it is not easy to decide. 
5. Loans with interest rates determined by supply and demand - adds such a great layer of possibility to the game.
6. Shorting mechanism - initially this was all the hype but we realize that this mechanism's role is primarily to keep companies honest.

It is a wonderful game!

This is the most opaque 18XX game for me. I was never sure when to care about a company and when not to care about one. The track laying is very boring. I hate the shorts and the variable interest loans, making the game a little too mean for my taste.

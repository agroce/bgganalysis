Good fun, take that or play under the radar game.

A group of us learnt it from the rules and played in about an hour.  Pretty good.
Now want to play the monster variant...

Very good light filler, although it's a very vicious game.  Felt like it could have been made into more of a game somehow, but still good nonetheless.  Everyone always wants to play this one (it works with 2-4 players), it plays quickly, and it's "fun" (by fun, I mean that you can't help but screw other people over and also get completely screwed over yourself, almost every single turn, every game).

This game has been "fired" by W. Kramer's far superior Blox.

Ho giocato infinite volte su BSW nel 2002-04, poi ho acquistato la scatola e ho giocato anche dal vivo una quarantina di volte, quindi la scatola è rimasta sullo scaffale per una decina d'anni, infine ora non ce l'ho più dopo l'ultimo trasloco. Era un bel gioco, anche se i giochi astratti mi piacciono poco, comunque ho bei ricordi. Il meccanismo non è immediato, dopo un paio di partite però si ingrana ed è piacevole.

RATING: 8
This is both elegant and fun.  It's such a simple idea - as in many of the best games, but they play-out of it makes for quite a lot of strategy and thinking.  Oh, sure, there's luck - no problem at all for me! - but good play is most important.

The fun and depth of play is further increased by employing the Godzilla variant - whereby a small statue of Godzilla (not supplied) is moved around the cities knocking over tiles.  This means that players have to think about at least 2 macro things whilst they are playing a card:  how will my tower build affect me and others and how will the movement of King Kong affect me and others?  

My group also like using the subtler rule that the beast only knocks over the top floor of a tower when he gets to it.  I christened this the "King Kong" variant and we use a model of King Kong instead of Godzilla for the purpose.

Great fun and also has the ability to be a good Family as well as a good Gamer's Game.

From the Reviews: I am a structural engineer, of course I will like this game. I like the building aspect, the intense strategy and the cut throatness. It might not be a good game for my wife and I but since it plays 2-4 and plays fast I think that I can get others to play. it was the SdJ so perhaps my wife will like it. Good price

A puzzle-y game with a good amount of player interaction.  The random nature of the cards annoyed me at times and can severely cut into any so-called plans you might have.  I'd probably rate this higher and enjoy it more if it weren't for the way the random card draw can eliminate any strategy or tactics you wish you could pursue.

An ultra-simple game.  Play a card, place a building on the space shown on the card in one of six cities.  Four or six times during the game (dependent on number of players) there is a scoring in which tallest tower, area majorities and individual buildings all score points.  Something you quickly discover is that contesting the tallest tower is wasted effort; lots of small ones bring both area control and individual building points.  

I probably would have sold Manhattan long ago were it not for the Godzilla variant.  This puts a tower-chewing monster on the board, who moves in a direction determined by that card you play.  Godzilla adds much more angst to the card play.  You desperately want a building block just there, but playing a card to achieve that moves Godzilla next to a valuable tower of yours.  You get the idea.

Production quality is good.  Artwork is mediocre.  The rules are clear.

Very interesting abstract game, with very few rules but some quite interesting decisions. It might get a little random at times, but this is usually mitigated bu the fact that you get to choose the buildings you'll use during the round, depending on your cards.

It's a very mean game, but getting in the way of your friends is a lot of fun. Also, while a mean, random game is not usually my cup of tea, it's short enough to make these traits into qualities instead of drawbacks.

[i]Posted: 11/27/05, Rated: 7[/i]

BGG may call it a "city building" game, but I call it an area control game with a vertical component.  Call it 3DAC.

The first aspect of the game to grasp is that of building "element" selection.  Elements may be one to four stories in height.  If you add an element of your color to an existing building, the total number of stories in your color must be at least equal to the number of stories of any other single player who also has elements in that building.  Having the taller elements allows you to "overpower" other colors easily, and take ownership of a particular building.  You only have a small number of three- and four-story elements, so you must ration them carefully during the course of the game.  I love this part of the game.

You can build in any one of six "cities" (3x3 grids), but the cells in which you can build are randomly determined by cards.  Often I will think, "I can take over this building without crushing my opposition, and save a four-story piece.  If someone takes it back, I can always add more."  This second line is a complete lie.  You might not draw the card that allows you to build in that particular spot on the city grids.  If you can achieve a five-story lead over another player, then that player won't be able to play again on that particular building.  The players in my gaming group call this supremacy move "the drive for five."

You could find yourself gambling with a one-story building that allows you to have a majority within a particular city, hoping that an opponent can't build in that same spot.  Solid play and good element selection can still be undone by the cards.  I strongly dislike this aspect of the game.  It has a healthy helping of "gang up on the leader," but that is true of any game that is played on a common board.

I think that I like area control games in general, but they can also be frustrating to play when luck plays a significant factor.  Overall, [i]Manhattan[/i] is a fun game.  It is a perfect example of the German game: simple enough to teach to non-gamers, streamlined rules, and surprising depth.  It is an excellent introduction to the area control mechanic.  Had I played it a year ago, I would have rated it an 8 or a 9.  It still may work its way up a notch or two with repeated playings.

RATING: 7
There are some games that are merely classics because they are old, but then there are games like Manhattan that deserve their status as true classics.  I love when a game can take the simplest of mechanisms and still manage to make it all really interesting.  I mean in this game you just play a card and then place a tower piece on the indicated space in one of the cities.  Yet you are constantly thinking about whether to place in one city where you can seize majority, or in another where you can break up someone else's majority, or even in a city where you will take over the tallest tower.

The only bad thing about this game is really not a flaw, but a personality trait that is very common amongst my family and friends.  A lot of them are very reluctant to play games with direct confrontation, and this shy somewhat unassuming game has some serious bite to it.  You can actively attack your opponents' spaces and if you play with overly sensitive people this won't go over well.  Again this is not a flaw in the game, in fact this adds quite a bit of strategic intensity, but just be warned that it might turn off people who like a more friendly game.  Although this means my opportunities to play may be limited, I'm still excited to play again soon, because this game is so much fun.

"My building's bigger than yours!"  Actually tallest building is not as important as neighborhood control.

I've played with the Godzilla Variant and without.  Both are fun.  With Godzilla, you can crash your opponents building, but it affects your play choices as well.  Some people I play with start to ignore completely where the building is going to go and pick cards soley on what it makes Godzilla do.

I really enjoyed this. The gameplay is quick, and it's really cool to see all the towers going up as the game progresses. Someone was bothered by the fact that he never got the card that allowed him to place in the space that he really wanted to play in, but I think that's part of the strategy: figuring out how best to use the cards that you get--if you can't catch up with someone by placing on top of their tower, then how else can you reduce their points and increase yours? I really liked it and can't wait to play it again. It was a 3-player game, and worked great.

Wow, this game is dry, abstract and mildly annoying.  Not good for 3 players.  Area majority is definitely a big part of this game, but you need to be lucky and have the right cards.  Often you find yourself waiting and hoping that you'll draw the right card.  Hand management opportunities are limited since you have only 4 cards in hand and used cards are replaced with random cards.  Everybody has this same handicap, though, so nobody can play very strategically.  Also, this game requires players to balance the attacks in order to keep one person from getting too far in the lead; therefore, someone who fails to spread the pain can "break" the game.  At least the game only takes 45-60 minutes.

At first I thought the card rotation thing was silly and added complication... but now I see the brilliance of this mechanic: It encourages greater competition in used grid locations.  The card distribution should be equal, so if Player A is consuming a bottom-row-center card to build there, Player B still has a full allotment of right-column-middle cards to build on top of Player A with, and Player C is looking for top-row-center cards to build on top of that.  This is genius!  But doesn't that mean that dead-center is the safest place to build?  (mental note: check deck distribution for dead-center cards versus others.)

That this was a Spiel des Jahres title shows the evolution of the gaming community and game design, because I feel this didn't stand the test of time very well. The main gripe for me would be the cards you draw that determine on which spots you can build in a city. I felt too little in control of the tactical placement. It's hard to strategize the building part choosing for each round when the luck of the draw determines your building options.

Anyway, this is a very simple area majority game where you can score in three ways. 3 points for the highest building, 2 points winning area majority and 1 point for each building. There are four rounds of placing 6 building parts. Scoring takes place after each round. There are some additional rules for stacking building parts, as there are parts in varying heights (1-4 steps) and ownership goes to the owner of the last placed part.

About as fun as two dimensional Lego.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding this top notch conclusion from user 'getareaction':

Feels like a game of managing your luck and ekeing tight margins. The relative merit of different strategies is a bit opaque, and ultimately not interesting enough to try and work out, for my tastes. Very prone to ganging up on a player. Rating based on two plays. Bought at auction in April 2016, traded away in June 2016.

Although fun and VERY fast moving, the game seems almost like a child's game when you play with two players; a little too simple with few strategies.  Maybe it is more enjoyable with 3-4?

RATING: 6
Nice simple mechanics, good concept and quick to explain and play.  However, the tendency in a three player game for two players to 'slug it out' while the third prospers is a bit of a problem, and with four players it tends to become two sets of one on one combat.  The luck element is a little too high and the breadth of strategy and variability in game play a little low for my liking, but it's still a fun and easy quick one for those not seeking a heavy or demanding game - good for a social setting.

Recent Ebay purchase from local seller.  Fun filler game that's easy to play with decent amounts of strategy.  Very cool 3D aspect of building up your sky scrapers.  Probably the best "take that" mechanic of any board game that I played.  It's not too punishing, but loads of trash talking and laughter among the group capping each other back and forth.  The only downfall is the 1994 graphics that look like they're from 1974.

Nice game with a deal of strategic thinking and a dash of luck thrown in. Can be played rather vindictively I find, always trouncing one another by building on top of one another.

Juego de mayorías muy sencillo de explicar y jugar. El tablero está dividido en seis ciudades y cada una de ellas está representada por una matriz de 3x3 casillas. El juego se divide en rondas. Al principio de cada ronda, el jugador debe escoger qué edificios va a utilizar. cuando es el turno del jugador, debe descartar una carta que indica dónde se va a jugar el edificio y colocarlo. Los edificios pertenecen al ultimo jugador que colocó sobre él una pieza. Sencillo y resultón.  Bastante estrategia, para las pocas reglas que tiene.

Especialmente recomendable en entornos no jugones.

Cambiado a Chesirecat en CLBSK2012 (mayo) por un formula Dé (la edición antigua).

I have the impression that this is hit or miss depending on the hand cards. If everybody draws cards that allow to play one the same spots, it is a fun game. But I played several games that felt rather boring, and maybe it was because the cards didn't allow enough interaction. 

Maybe it would be better if there where less spots to play on in each city (e.g. 8 instead of 9). 

I have yet to try it with the Godzilla variant ^_^

Area control game.  Wow, I've said those words a lot recently.  This really is a pure area control game, without much innovation.  I guess back in 1994 maybe this was novel, but now it's old.  No real complaints about it, it's just like a million other games.  There should be more points awarded for highest building.  The game could be made more interesting by adding bonus points.... say, 3 points at the end of the game for each tic-tac-toe line (buildings in which you have majority) you have on each board.  That would TOTALLY change the game and make it far more complex.  Wow, they should hire me.

In 2010, Tom Vasel listed this as the No. 1 game all gamers should own. Seriously. I don't know what to say about it other than you use cards to put pieces on a board. You do this for a long time, scoring occasionally. I fail to see the appeal. It also doesn't help that the board is butt ugly and the color scheme is awful.

While not a hugely strategic or tactical game, and mostly about trashing the leader, this game still has a really nice niche as a game you can play with family, friend, kids, etc., because it's quite simple but quick-playing, very interactive, with some depth, and fun because it encourages some nice table-talk. You're trashing people all the time so you can't get too hung up on it.

Only played a few times. This is a bit of a weird one. It's fun, but it feels like it's not quite done or something. My custom variant: 1 point for the tallest building in each neighborhood. Seems to make the competition a little more two-dimensional (most buildings vs tallest building). But the winner seems to be the player who just gets screwed the least by others. I'm not sure yet whether it really has much to do with their own play. There's just not much choice given the small set of cards. Maybe some card drafting system would help. I'm not sure. Fun for what it is.

RATING: 4
A fast majority game with relatively simple rules, that is Manhattan. I have to admit that the appearance of this game is not particularly inviting, but then again we're talking a game 15 years old when production processes weren't as good and diverse as they are today. 

Although there is nothing really wrong with the game itself, I found that I didn't much care for the fact that the card draw dictated where you could put your buildings. It keeps the game from becoming a terse min-maxing business, true, but at the same time it transforms the game into a [i]simple[/i] min-maxing business. There really is little alternative but to make do with what you've been given, and to plan one, at most two moves ahead. There is little room for anything else. Given the choice I think I'd rather play Samurai or Web of Power which scratch a similar itch, but scratch it more satisfyingly.

RATING: 8
Manhattan is a very simple area majority game where players focus not just on each area on the board, but also the overall height of the skyscrapers - aiming to have the tallest after each round.  Quantity is also important, as every tower you "control" counts to your score.

What I like is how very easy this is to learn.  I also like that you are forced to pick which towers to use in a round ahead of time.  The downside is perhaps the push-and-pull for many towers, which can feel a little tedious.  But with so many spots on the board to play, that's not much of a problem.

An elegant ruleset - the simple rules seem to hold a fair bit of depth in there.

Having said that, I felt the proceedings had so much complexity and politics involved as to feel almost random - though I wanted to properly evaluate each possible choice, there was so much hidden information and so many possibilities that to keep the game moving, it's necessary to play more by instinct, using vague strategies rather than tactics.

Maybe that's the point. After another game or two, I imagine I'd have a better 'sense' of where to play and which 3x3 squares to compete in or leave alone.

2009-05-28 7.6->8.5

I enjoyed it yet more on my 2nd game.

I feel that politics plays a massive part in this game - though cards limit your options, building can be 'taken' so easily! The game seems as much about thinking what will be ignored and 'fly under the radar' as it is about what would give you the most points.

Though it is possible to 'lock others out' by planting 5 more floors than anyone else, doing so essentially guarantees you that one point rather than letting you have a chance at two.

Battles are to be avoided except towards the end.

Most points seem like they're attained by the buildings rather than dominance or the tallest tower (though the dominance and tallest-tower bonuses are enough to encourage bickering).

Points are easy to remember as it's 1,2,3.

Rules are simple but there's a lot of interesting choices, including the location and tower piece to use and even the towers to select each round.

The whole game feels very cut-throat and a leader is easily taken down if ganged up on.

I imagine this game would play very differently with different groups given the ability to screw others so easily.

RATING: 5
A game about constructing buildings in New York, or in cities around the world, depending on which edition you get.  Players play cards which tell them where you can build in a block.  Points are awarded at a few points in the game for majorities, tallest, etc.  Bland and rather nasty.  Entertaining in the mid-1990's, but game design has moved on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Dry majorities-based eurogame.

When played with the Ward Godilla Variant, this game becomes far more fun and I'd rate it quite a lot higher. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is absolutely brilliant. It's easy to teach, but has lots of depth, and can appeal to both gamers (it plays quickly) and absolute newbs.  Building your towers in 3D is fun. The game can be cutthroat, turns are quick and scoring is straightforward. Game loses a point due to the low quality graphic design on the board - maybe a swanky reprint will improve things. Also the version I have makes the blocks into separate cities, which is arbitrary, they could easily just be blocks in Manhattan, which I'd prefer. Overall an excellent game, that I doubt will ever leave my collection.

The rules for this game are quite simple, and once everyone got his head around the concept, it quickly gets fairly tactical and strategic. Player will quickly get into fights over territory and stacking on each others buildings.
The boards looks rather ugly, but I guess it's because it is old. I need to play this game more often in order to consolidate my opinion. Maybe with the godzilla rules.

RATING: 7
It's surprising how simple this game is - play a card, put a building on the board.   It couldn't be any simpler.   The scoring allows you to get points for majority, tallest building, and total buildings, so there are a couple of layers to keep it interesting.   It's probably not a good idea to be in the lead, since this pretty much ensures that people will place their buildings on top of you.  Feels very representative of the super-light, family-friendly, 90's-style SdJ winners.   Adding the Godzilla/Robot/Monster allows for some destruction of buildings and make a more thoughtful game, at the cost of doubling the game length.   In this case, simpler might be better, depending on who you are playing with.

SOLD IT!

I guess these game need some sort of limiter to dictate pawn placement, but unlike something like El Grande I was just uninterested in which card I should play.

Visually I was torn. The climbing building pieces look great and feel like growing cities, but the board looked like a hideous Power Point presentation unsuitable for even a place-mat!

Relatively short yet engaging multi-player game with interesting light strategy decisions.  Good mix of opportunities for planning with the necessity for flexibility. Visual and tactile appeal of stackable building bits a plus.  Recommended.

Manhattan might be the best of the quintessentially 'old' games. The box and board are reminiscent of games you'd play in your grandparent's basement, with dull, incongruous art, and lacking graphic design. That aside, Manhattan is a rather strong abstract area majority game. The jostling for the tallest tower, is a classic pissing contest that, despite your best intentions, will inevitably pull you in; the stakes are just too high to ignore. The strongest aspect of the game is the selection of towers that occurs prior to each round. Do you go strong now, with a weaker round down the road, or do you go the opposite route, or perhaps you try to play a level hand each round? All of the game's decisions are small, but they are many and they are fun.

Seyfarth's Manhattan is an interesting, light area control game that is driven by cards and interesting 3d pieces. Make sure the pack is tight and go after the leader early. 

6 to 7 Manhattan is really great with 4. I left playing with 3 thinking it was a little too boring, but thought the game was much, much better with four. 

This is also a good gateway/training game for eurogaming. Multiple scoring rounds lets everyone know who the leader is, and deciding who to hinder is important too. Optimal moves are often evident, which helps players decide what to do.

Everything that a multiplayer placement game could be.  I played with two, 3, and 4 players and they are different games.  Two is ... ok .... it's playable, but it was much better with 3.  With 3 there was still enough space to play it either more or less competitively.  With 4, Manhattan becomes a battleground.  All fun and with more plays my rating will likely increase.

Played at BayCon 2012.

Really nice game with simple choices on a players turn, unfortunatly one player in a four player game didn't really understand the rules on building (you can only build equal or more floors than your opponents) and thus the game was a bit skewed by this.

Would love to play with the Godzilla varient which would introduce much more chaos but I think I need to be more familiar with the base game first.

Very close game with the leader(me) just a point ahead of the tied second and third players. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Easily one of my favourites, a simple building game controlled by a random deck of cards. The joy comes in getting the other players to fight each other and not me. I've never bothered going for the tallest tower, it seems a futile battle for little reward. I do go for most majorities, or for forcing draws in the scoring. Avoid winning the first round, they'll just pick on you. A must buy game.

A winner.  A great gateway/family game.  It is fun, quick, and easy with engaging strategy.  As one of our group put it, an ellegant game everyone likes.  It is going to be pulled off the shelf often.  

On every scoring round, we traded places somewhat dramatically with some of us way ahead of others, but in the final round we were all within one point of each other.  There is chance in the cards drawn, but the rest is up to the player.

I've had this game in my want list for such a long time that when it finally arrived, I had to try it right there and then.  I'm glad that we tried the Godzilla version; what an absolute riot!  Nobody who played thought that the game should be played without it.  So cool.  My quest now is to find the ultimate monster figurine, we used Grishnak from LotR minis for the first game.  He did a good job, but I felt he was holding back; his constant remarks that the Statue of Liberty's legs looked tasty got old in a hurry.

Egy meglehetősen csúnyácska absztrakt toronyépítős játék. A véletlenszerűen kisztott kártyák alapján lehet toronyszinteket építeni. Mindig azé a torony, aki legfelül van. De csak olyan toronyra rakhatsz, ahol ezáltal neked lesz a legtöbb szinted. A körök végén pont jár a tornyokért, régiókban szerzett többségért, és természetesen a legnagyobb toronyért.

Kb. ennyi a szabály, és mégis nagyon élvezetes a játék. Egyértelműen 4 játékossal lehet a legjobb, de hárman se volt rossz. Talán hármasban érdemes kivenni az egyik területet a játékból, hogy több legyen a konfrontáció.

Egyszerű, de nagyszerű játék. Örülnék egy újranyomásnak, szebb, kisebb táblával, fatornyocskákkal.

Szívesen kipróbálnám a Tom Vasel féle gozillás változatot is.

However, I am not sure if I like the attack factor. The kids seem not to be much bothered about that. But I think there is little to do when other players sistematically go on top of your towers. Yet i played a few games where the leader was able to keep well ahead the game and win the game, despite the effort of other players to take over his towers.

Played for second time last night after getting my own copy. There were only two of us playing, which was fun, but harder to concentrate on two colors each. You had to decide to make one lose, and at the game, strategically, use to cover tops of color dominating an area. Neighbor boy who played, my sons friend, said he really enjoyed it alot, and wanted to play again. Hardest thing, especially on last round or two, there are so many things to do, and only so many pieces to use; do you try to build the tallest building, cover as many of the lead players pieces, or dominate a section?  So many choices, so few pieces!  Great fun and great replay value. Also not an expensive game, especially for the amount I know we're going to play it.

Good fun with some excellent screwage factor if thats your thing.  Play time is perfect for what it is.  I can see this coming out on a regular basis in the gaming group.  Wish they'd updated the art and buildings - it looks old and really deserves better production values.

Based on first play, I'd say I like it. Need to play more times to figure out best ways to build up control without tipping the other players off too quickly about where I am going. Like the aspect of being able to deny majority in a block even if I am not pursuing control there myself. Of course I hate it when someone does that to me! :-)

Régóta érdekelt e játék egyrészt mint SdJ-díjazott, másrészt mint a PR-tervez%u0151 alkotása. Nem okozott csalódást, bár eddig 1 partimban nem teljesen sikerült céljaimat keresztülvinni.

- igazán magas épület csak közös tulajdonból n%u0151 ki,
- mindig a fejedre telepszenek.

Constructing buildings in Manhattan.  The game is quite abstract.  You place buildings in different areas of the board, using your coloured buildings.  The buildings are of different heights.  You can build on top of someone else's building so long as the height of the building you place is at least as high as the other person's building(s).  The buildlings are plastic blocks, which makes the game quite tactile.  I like that.  You gets points for the number of buildings you own (where your colour is at the top), the number of areas you control (where you own the majority of buildings) and the person with the tallest buildings gets points.  Game consists of four rounds, with scoring after each round.

I like the way that the game grows, with more and more buildings appearing and getting taller.  Quite confrontational, as you find each other building over the top of each other's buildings.

Simple rules, good components, and fast, fun play make for a very good game of 'building' skyscrapers, with subtle strategy. The theme is thin, as it really isn't about skyscrapers as it is about area control, but it is fun to pretend one is 'building' skyscrapers. There's plenty of luck due to the cards, but this can possibly be mitigated with proper play (and hence the subtle strategy). There's also plenty of 'screw your neighbor' in this game, making for some spirited gameplay. I'm sure the Godzilla variant would add another whacky level of fun and unpredictability. As one cannot and should not take this game seriously, this makes for a very good filler that plays reasonably well in 30-45 minutes.

City building:area influence:hand management:{major}screwage

A very fun and dirty play Sdj winner if you don't mind some chaos and a good dose of luck (which I usually do but the game length and fun factor make it tolerable here). 

This is an elegant Euro where you are playing one card on your turn letting you build a single section of a building in any of the six cities. At the start of the game you have 24 different sections (1 - 4 levels each) and before every round you choose 6 to play that round. You are trying to get majorities in any of the 6 cities(9 spots in each), trying to own the largest building by having the top level and trying to have as many buildings as possible. Major screwage comes in when you build on top of someone elses section which is quite necessary to winning and this can spark some er... quite 'interesting' comments from the victims. 

The screwage while being somewhat frustrating is also very fun and because everyone is doing it and HAS to do it you don't stay mad too long(usually :P). Card play can get quite interesting as some "chicken wars" can transpire in a Taj Mahal sort of fashion with the "There are more where that came from" posture introducing a slight bluff element as well. While it is also frustrating if you really need a card and can't get it there are lots of other things you need to be doing so you still have some control (4 cards in hand) and planning is still very necessary. Beating on the leader is fairly easy (maybe too easy), quite necessary and fun unless you are winning which means you sometimes adopt a lose the first round approach.

1 minute explaination, 30 - 45 minutes to play with no AP (fast pace), 3 ways to score and mutliple approaches to play make this a great little game. Best played for the fun aspect as you have limited control over how games will transpire. Good gateway game if people have thick enough skin and avoid playing with the wife is she is the sensitive type. 

Update: While the Godzilla variant would really trash the game too much the 'Baby Zilla' variant was fun and added another layer of strategy to the card play, I like it.

RATING: 6
Very light and simple area control game that I think must be really amazing back in 1994 but compared to today's design, Manhattan feels very outdated. Rather simplistic and depends heavily on luck of the draw. However I have to give it credit for the hard decisions present in the game. Either you push for the tallest building or for area majority and both paths are viable in this game. Not a game you can take seriously and just play for fun.

Just the one game so far (two player game). This is a great game to play with people who don't play a lot of board games. The 3D aspect of the game makes this a very visual game; seeing the buildings grow in size and all over the board is very satisfying. I like that each player sits on a different side of the board, so the cards will indicate a different lotion on the game board basted on you orientation. I also like how quickly the game plays and how intuitive it is to pick up. There is a way to play this game with a monster that will move in the direction of your card that I'm excited to try. A wonderful gateway game when you just want fun without heavy thinking.

RATING: 10
Wonderful family game with 3/4 players. If your players are cunning and competitive, it's all better. 

It has all I like: determining your own strategy, tactical placement/positioning, reacting to your opponents decisions, doing your best with some amount of luck, plus some diplomacy/influencing other players. All this with the most simple rules. I find the idea of selecting a set of buildings to play at the begining of each round very clever.

Simple rules but quite a complex game to keep us engaged throughout the four rounds. The best is definitely with four players because as the game progress it was more and more challenging to put down your piece not only to a good place but to a place at all. You have various choices as to which card you choose, which piece you put down and whether you go for majority, number of buildings or/as highest building. The game is quite interactive and can be agressive. What I find interesting is that being agressive pays off, but only to a certain extent. We had some good laugh when we built on each other's tower. A well balanced game.

Manhattan doesn't reflect badly on the crop of 1994. It's an early area majority game where complications arise from card-based placement restrictions and the ability to conditionally steal someone's spot. Some tension and conflict and trying to sneak in points under the radar. Often it seems you have just one or two viable moves but there are still choices to be made. Hopefully the game will not feel too light after several plays.

It doesn't work nearly as well with two as with four: first, you are essentially playing two concurrent games and might as well scale it down to two colours and three cities, and second, there's no incentive grid but an incentive see-saw, which is just not as interesting. There's a tendency in the four-player game as well to fight one-on-one in each city, but this is only cemented in the latter stages and it's not a given that all players will compete in an equal number of cities. I'm curious to see how it works with three, perhaps using five cities.

Thrifted on 6/5 2013, 30/5 2013, 21/9 2013, 14/1 2014, 11/3 2016, 3/5 2016, 23/7 2016, 8/6 2017 and 9/9 2017.

2 players so might get a better score with 4 players. The cards dictate your actions too much and not collecting a certain card can ruin your game. Would be interesting to see how it plays if people could build anywhere, removing the card element.

Manhattan is a curious little game with a big map.
It's also an Spiel des Jahres winner.

The game plays pretty quickly. I saw this mentioned as one of the top gateway games and I would agree to a certain degree.

It's a top gateway game because scoring is very close.
 It's not because it sort of allows backstabbing. In the three player game I played (6 rounds instead of the four)
scores were pretty close. Alain the frontrunner won with 63 points. I came second by scoring 20 points! in the final round to get to 62. And Gust had 57 points.
It's a top gatewaygame because the rules are very easy and you are playing in no time.
It's not because your choices are limited.
It's a top gatewaygame because it clocks in under 45 minutes.

For all these reasons I rate the game 7.5  (my average rating for over 300 games is 6). It's not meaty enough for me but it makes an interesting filler. 
There is another game with skycrapers that comes to mind. That game is Metropylis. Metropylis I rate an 8. I didn't expect such a high rating but I really liked the bidding in that one.  And Metropylis is less luck.  I considered Metropylis to be a gateway game but now I think there might be a little too much going on.

Manhattan is a light building game, which looks awful: colors of the board and building pieces are are… well… not so great BUT at least them works. Game itself is quite nice, althought time has overtaked this spiel des jahres winner (1994): nowadays there are much better games than those days, so I'll play Manhattan very rarely. 

Nice little detail: Capitol feels a little bit like Manhattan, but it is more challenging and interesting one. Even if you didn't like Manhattan, you still might like Capitol - I just love it. On the other hand: if you like Manhattan, I suggest you to try Capitol!

Very fun with the monster but a bit dry without.  Focusing on getting the highest skyscraper will come back to haunt you if you sacrifice majority and the starting of other towers.  It also may not be a great game to get out to a large lead early as this game lends itself to a bash the leader syndrome.  With the monster in play, I give it a 7.  Without the monster in play, I don't want to play - maybe a 4.

This is a game about getting other players to attack each other rather than you.  In some games (i.e., Nuclear War), I’m okay with that.  But here, there’s not much theme, just plain old finger pointing and nastiness.  Ick.

RATING: 5
Played on BSW.  Not a bad little game, but you're a bit too at the mercy of the card draw, and there seems to be strong potential for pound the leader play.  There is an interesting quality where plays in one corner of the board have an indirect impact on distant areas (mostly through forcing a redirection of resources).  With more plays this rating could easily go in either direction.

UPDATE: Manhattan has dropped off of my gaming radar completely. I'm not sure that I've played it in the last year. Down to a 5.

Great 'non-gamer' game. Everyone who plays this understands what's going on immediately. And has fun.

We find this horrible with 2. And we are typically [i]very[/i] open-minded regarding playing games 2 player that were not intended for 2 (we claim that the box is wrong). The game plays fantastically with 3 and 4.

Occasionally fun to balance out the 3 player turn sequence, but not essential. Pick 6 items instead of 4, or however the math works out. We've done this with the 4 player version as well - have the game go for 6 rounds instead of 4, which balances the Start Player dis/advantage better (who wants to be the last player on the first turn?).

This is one of our favorite games.

You have various sized pieces that you put on in four rounds.  Each round you can place on a city location based on cards.  The location can cover other players building or go in an empty space.  Each location where your piece is on top scores points as well as for majority control in cities.  You also get bonuses for tallest building.  An old Spiel des Jahres winner but visually looks very cool with the growing buildings.  It holds up very well after 20 years.  

It does lend itself for "kill the leader" but extremely family friendly

Die Spieler versuchen möglichst eindrucksvolle Wolkenkratzer zu bauen. Jeder Spieler besitzt 24 Bauteile in verschiedenen Größen. Den genauen Bauplatz bestimmt eine Positionskarte. Ist der Platz noch frei, setzt man seinen Baustein.
Steht auf dem Platz bereits ein Haus, kann man seinen Stein oben aufsetzen, wenn man danach mindestens so viele Stockwerke in diesem Turm besitzt, wie der bisherige Inhaber. Ein Haus gehört immer dem Spieler, dessen Bauteil gerade die oberste Etage belegt. 
Bald gibt es etliche Reibungspunkte, da die Gebäude der vorherigen Runde nicht abgerissen werden, sondern stehen bleiben. Dadurch wird das freie Baugelände immer weniger und die Türme immer höher.

I was excited to get this game and eager to play it, but afterwards I was left with a feeling of blah.  It's not a bad game at all, but there just wasn't enough excitement during play, and no one really felt like they'd accomplished anything during the game.  It certainly is nice looking, with a great board and sturdy pieces, but it's not going to see a lot of repeat play.  I'll keep it for now, but if I want to build a city, I'll play [b]Big City[/b].

[b]Manhattan[/b] by [person=117][/person] (Puerto Rico, Thurn and Taxis...)

An area control and hand management game for 3-4 players. Build and fight over ownership of skyscrapers in eight world metropolises.

Very tactical, simple rules and scoring, best with 4 players. Easy to introduce to non-gamers. Children love the buildings and learn it quick. It's become a classic. Spiel des Jahres 1994 prize winner. Deserves a reprint.

A clever, simple area majority game that doesn't give players that much to think about and has real potential for take-that moves. It's one that feels elegant from a rules perspective, but too often also feels obvious based on the cards you are (literally) dealt. Certainly a clean, fun design, but not a favorite of mine somehow. Ultimately, I don't feel as if I control my fate as much as other players do. The King Kong/Godzilla variants are more chaotic, but also more fun.

The "evil" hat game. Why 'hat game'? Because its all about putting your hat on someone else's stack of hats. Why "evil"? Because it incites rage in my girlfriend, therefore she calls it "Eeeeevil".

The most basic of area control games, and yet in that simplicity is fun.

The early 90's euro-chic graphics are dated and ugly, and have me looking to upgrade to the reissue. Although, I must say, I like the box image on the original.

I was little disappointed and a little impressed with this game at the same time.  The rules seemed really simple at first so I was not sure exactly what my strategy should be.  The flip switched somewhere in the second round and I can certainly appreciate this game for its elegance simplicity.  It is easy to waste a lot of turns in a pissing contest for a point so you need to stay focused on picking up the easy points that will fly under the radar.

You get to choose six building types each round, but the cards are drawn after each turn, and you can only place buildings on spaces that match your cards. Tallest buildings score, but you also get a point for each building you own, regardless of height.

Quite good with two players but far to 'random' for this kind of game with four players due to psycholcical aspects. If you are perceived as the strongest competitor at the beginning of the game (e.g. after the first round) and at least two of the four players tend to play against you you have no chance of winning.

I liked the simple rules however deeper game, like Union Pacific.  The cards with the different positions, which differ for each player depending on orientation was unique.  I liked selecting the tower heights to use per round.  I liked the competition for city block control and high towers.

No main issues with the game, however can be a little dry and repetitive over the rounds.  The towers needed more pronounced Windows to determine levels.

1 play - Another fine beer-and-pretzels or family game. We played our fist time without the Godzilla variant, but I think we’ll add it in the future. I found the game to be mostly tactical, with light decision making. My kids really enjoyed it (stealing Dad’s buildings is always a hoot for them), and that’s basically why we got this one. I can see why it won the Spiel des Jahres back in 1994; Manhattan is a great gateway game. Perhaps it’s a little light for my general taste, but I’m sure I’ll keep it around for at least a handful of more plays.

Another game that is simply so much better than it looks. May seem basic but it's a solid area control with good balance, tense situations, and lots of fun, very good with non-gamers, as well. Make sure you don't relax until the end, as if you're not careful you may lose in the last round. I was kind of clueless the first game, but afterwards it got better and better. Even has a worthwhile 2-player game mode that is also quite good.

A game of "take that", limited luck and maximizing the outcome of your moves.

The rules are simple to explain and the game plays fast. 

Easy to introduce to new gamers and new players will eagerly request a second play right after the first one.

This game will teach you to be nice to other people, as usually the players who go at each others' throats will lose the game.

Don't play with angry people. :)

Very quick and enjoyable game. Rules are short and simple to understand. Only 2 & 3 player so far with the expectation that 4-player will bring this up from a 7 rating to a 7-plus. Instead of playing 2 sides each in the 2-player game, we played one set of pieces on only 1/2 the board. Not quite as many decisions but much easier for learning. Might also suggest an addition to the scoring to add to the decision choices: 1 point for each string of 3 buildings in the same row, column, or on diagonals.

One play. This is a great family game. Playing with the monster variant is a must as it makes each card play serve two purposes: this greatly increases the depth and interest of the game; the occasional skyscraper crashing down is just an added bonus!

In this short, tense game, players build skyscrapers in New York, with the exact building locations limited by the cards in their hands. Although everyone can contribute to the construction of a skyscraper, only the player who built its top floor can claim ownership. And ownership is important, because at the end of each round every skyscraper you own contributes to your point total, as does owning the most in a single area, and even owning the tallest one!

A fin little abstract strategy game that has lots of interaction, but not always a way to clearly plan as others play quite differently or just to be mean to you.  Recommended.

This game melds an interesting mechanic of card play and tower creation, but is not as heavy as the designer's other big hit.  Fun game, but not too heavy.

12/16 2 plays of this but I really enjoy it. This is basically a super filler, with a extremely low rules over head and non AP inducing decisions.

A SdJ winner that is relatively light but has the potential for a lot of conflict, much more so than more recent winners it seems.

More players the better. Very nice look at the end game. Feels like being in one of those pictures on the front of an 80s family game box - look of concentration whilst placing a last piece, the others looking on with merry smiles. Jerseys should be worn to play this game, and with a son and daughter of similar age, and freckled faces.

RATING: 5
Visually this is special experience as the city grows throughout the course of the game. The game itself isn't particularly spectacular, but works as well as a social game set up on the coffee table. You're trying to think a few turns ahead and hope your opponents don't see your devilish plans in time to spoil them. For games in this genre I prefer Spiele der Tuerme over this.

Another area influence game I like, but this time it's all vertical.  Lots of strategic and tactical decisions to be made, but in the end you could find your plan blown out of the water because you dont get the cards you need.  Managing the luck of the card draw is key to success in this game.  Unfortunately, I have no idea how to do it!

There is a lot more strategy to Manhattan than I thought at first.  My original feeling was that you place towers all over and hope for the best because it all depends on the cards.  True, it all depends on the cards--but there is a fairly nice level of strategy in using your cards to determine your placement.  It is very important where you choose to build , where you concentrate, and how you can defend towers.  Since you have multiple opponents all trying to outmaneuver you, you have to consider your moves very carefully.  This is one I really look forward to playing again.

RATING: 7.5
Manhattan -- The rules are very easy to pick up, but the game has surprising depth.  I consider this a good "gateway" game to introduce players of traditional American games to a more European sensibility (simple rules, streamlined play, satisfying depth).  There's just enough luck in the drawing of cards to prevent predictable play.  

The index in the top corner of each card is large, but since players hold only four cards at a time, players can easily hold their cards fanned to see their available options.

RATING: 6
Too many opportunities to screw (and and get screwed) in Manhattan keep it from being a really good family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple game of area majorities, in which players are rewarded for owning majorities in city blocks, the tallest skyscraper and skyscrapers in general. The game is more or less about optimising your card draws, although the decision of which 6 pieces you want to bring into the round is pretty clever. The design overall feels slightly dated, but not by much.

The edition with artwork by Jacqui Davis is vibrant-looking – maybe a little too vibrant? It's tricky to tell the height of pieces from a glance, and the neon colours of the board are rather distracting.

[13 plays] Played this for the very first time as a 2 player game. I knew going in that this wasn't the optimal way to play the game. Indeed, 2 player does take too long considering the enjoyment payoff for that time investment.

Played subsequently as a 4 player game. 4 player game is good.

Have now played it a few times as a 3 player game. I think we've found the sweet spot here. This is a rapid, fun, and challenging 3 player game. To top it off, you can't beat how quick it is to teach and get rolling.

Most recent play Jan '17.

RATING: 8
Simple, elegant, fun and a little cutthroat. Players draft 6 buildings of varying heights over four scoring rounds. They then play a card which determines where they can place a building on one of 6 3x3 gridded cities before refreshing their hand with a new card. Scoring is triggered when all 6 buildings have been played.

The scoring is typical classy euro: highest building gets 3 points, each building that a player owns (by having the top piece on it) gets 1 point and a clear majority in each grid is worth 2 points. There's lot of thrash talking other people into playing towers elsewhere and expect emotions to fly when people vie for the highest building.

Fun game. Would be interesting to try variants. They don't make euros like these anymore.

Manhattan is a light game of building placement in which you score points for things like creating the tallest building and obtaining area control. Your placement is limited by your cards, however, and so you are not always able to build where you wish. This game has some great confrontation, but isn't very meaty. I certainly don't mind playing, and enjoy it, but would generally rather play something else. A good filler - prefer Torres, which (for me anyway) scratches the same itch while providing more options for clever play.

Not a bad game at all and certainly good to have, if you don't have too many better games, but ultimately I found more aspects of it annoying than I found them to be thrilling. Specifically I grew tired of having to constantly count how high the towers were or how strong the current owner of each tower was. Constantly scoring at the end of each round was also a drag (I vastly prefer games with just one final scoring at the end). Designed in 1994, the Twin Towers are featured prominently in the game, but after 9/11 it is not really not something you want to be reminded of while playing a fun family game. Like I said, a good game, but just not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun for a while.  I like city building games so I'm partial.  Really though this is just a one note abstract.  I think I got burned out on this when a friend of mine kept antagonizing me for trying to better my position rather than take down the leader.  Years later I forgot about the incident until I played it with him again.  Ugh.  So my enjoyment of the game has suffered a bit.  I should try to give it another go to rekindle my initial joy.  Not a must have, but will always play when offered (unless it is with that friend).

Would really be interested in the Godzilla variant.

After only one play.  I like the building up that happens, it's visually cool to look at (although the board and color selection is just plain horrible).  It reminds me of other area control games, but the ability to both add a controlling piece and at the same time cancel out an opponent's makes it a bit different.

I like this one, though I've only played it a couple of times, I like the area-control nature of it, as well as the nice components.  I realize the cards are necessary, but I think they add a bit of randomness that can really work against a player.

Instead of drawing a card after ech use, you can alternatively just use the 4 cards , one at a time. Then, refill 4 cards for next round. It makes it much harder to get card you want during round..............your choice.

RATING: 9
 Terrific game from the man we now know to be the designer of Puerto Rico. Tremendous replay potential. Playing it with two on-line at Brettspielwelt simplifies things a bit; no six rounds of four buildings or two color options. No "Godzilla" variants either, which is fine with me. The game is randomly complex enough without a roaming monster devouring your plan, building by building.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I can't honestly figure out a strategy in choosing which buildings to take each round, but I seem to do okay with saving most of the larger buildings for the last couple of rounds. I have learned to stay out of petty tallest building wars and to stick with just a few cities. The card play is a great way to limit what could be overwhelming choices (much like Metro's tile placement with the arrow).

[Mayfair Games 1994 edition] {City building; area control; optimal 4p} Manhattan is a nice family game - appropriate weight, appropriate play time, good interaction, attractive components and somewhat thematic.

A real surprise.

A light, super fast largely abstract game, but (in the way of Dominant Species) once you know what you're looking at, you can glance at the largely abstract map and instantly know what is going on.

It encourages some competition, but limits the amount of vindictiveness as there are limited gains to continuously attacking the same player/location.

Great fun.

Update: Perhaps is better when played a number of times in a row than just once. Down from 7.7 to 7.3.

Solid game with clear objectives that make each round captivating. There is a certain tit-for-tat feeling if you get into a battle with someone over, for example, highest building or most in an area -- but you quickly learn to avoid such distractions because they merely allow the other players to walk away with victory elsewhere. The cards limit where you can play, but rarely in such a way that you feel helpless. What's more, the limitations created by the cards create opportunities for planning. The game has great clarity despite the modest dose of randomness, which makes the struggle for supremacy feel as though it's all under your control.

All that said, I'm not sure how often I'd want to play. This feels more like an occasional pleasant experience than something I'd request often. If that opinion changes, and I hope it does, then my rating will go up.

Interesting game that I'm still not quite sure how I feel about even after four plays.  I can't tell whether the luck/strategy balance really favors strategy as much as I'd like it to, but am willing to keep trying as I get handle for this deceptively simple game.

In this short, tense game, players build skyscrapers in New York, with the exact building locations limited by the cards in their hands. Although everyone can contribute to the construction of a skyscraper, only the player who built its top floor can claim ownership. And ownership is important, because at the end of each round every skyscraper you own contributes to your point total, as does owning the most in a single area, and even owning the tallest one!

RATING: 5
Rather dull, for a variety of reasons. One is that the opening is aimless - this is a classic case of a game which should effectively start on turn 4 or so (with buildings already on the board). Another is the card system for placement, which has two bad effects. One is that you may have no meaningful moves through no fault of your own. Another is that you have no idea what moves are available to your opponents. These could both be mitigated with an Alan Moon-style face-up card selection system, but the game still ain't going to be that good.

I tried this once as a two player game at WBC 2005.  I liked it, but I wasn't crazy about it.  It has an engaging mechanic and I got a hint of how this could be a very tight game.  As a two player game, it seemed all about getting and maintaining control (which I couldn't do) and I think it would be more fun with some more ebb and flow in the game.  This game is probably more interesting when more people are involved, or I could have just missed something.

In the edition I've played with, each of the six "neighborhoods" has as a background part of a road map from the New York metro area.

None of the maps are actually from Manhattan itself, and a couple are even from New Jersey.  As a born-and-bred Jerseyan, I approve.

Though this game encourages players to visciously gang up on the leader, I enjoy playing it a lot. It's not too long and I like deciding what neighborhoods to compete in and if I should try and build or take over the highest building. I also like trying to build up a strong position without being in the lead and attacked by all the other players too early in the game.

RATING: N/A
Build skyscrapers piece by piece in 6 different locations. Only the person who has the top most piece of a building scores for that building. Points are awarded to the highest building, majority in each of 6 different locations, and for each building you own.

A randomly dealt hand of cards determines the potential spots where each player can choose to build. Locations have a 3x3 grid where buildings can be constructed, and each card has one spot of those 9 marked on it where you can build. What's neat about this system is that it's seating relative, because cards cannot be rotated. 

If I owned this game, I would most definitely print up a replacement board, as the provided one showing 6 different city names around the world is very lame. The [filepage=33605]Manhattan Island board by Todd Sanders[/filepage] in the file section is far superior.

First play - 4 players - I got off to a slow start and was far behind with one of the other newbs after the first round. This may have been a blessing because now I wasn't targetted as often as the two players out front. At the end of the third round I was slightly ahead and to my surprise I was again not targetted. This allowed me to win easily. I enjoyed the game. Winning first time out always leaves a better taste in your mouth than getting crushed. To add some more chaos to the game the monster variants look like a lot of fun.

This is a game of placement and majorities, with a couple of different ways to score each round.  Sounds like a yawner, right?  It's actually a pretty good game, and what really makes it good is the way that you pick the pieces you want to play in a round before the round begins, so you also have to anticipate what your opponents are going to do, as well as what you want to do, all without having all the cards for the upcoming round to see.  There's an element of risk involved with the game because of that, but it comes together quite well.  There's a small element of frustration when the cards you draw aren't the ones you need, but the hand management aspect of the game is another part of it that I like.  There are very few moves in the game that feel certain, which can be slightly frustrating, but that adds to the tension of the game, and besides, you have different things you can try over the course of the game.  It's pretty cutthroat, though, and as my opponent said, it's one of those games where you're very quiet as you're always thinking about your next move.

Two-player games feel very different from muliplayer games, since in that case, both players play two colors and combine their scores for their two colors.  This means that there's really no incentive to play both your colors into one city, and you can base your moves off of what pieces (if any) your opponent still has to play.  It reminded me of the different play styles of Hey! That's My Fish! between two and four players; both have their merits, but they change the way the game feels because of that player number.

Underrated area majority game. Use the cards in your hand to build towers on five different areas of the board. Over the course of several rounds (one round per player), you score points for the majority in each area, for your total amount of towers and the highest single tower on the board. Also fun in teams of 2vs2! I believe it would do well if it got a reprint with modern day components.

Two plays, each with 4 players.

Like: The game is completely language independent (I played a German version), can be taught in minutes, and plays in less than an hour. It's visually pleasing to watch each of the game's cities become populated with buildings, and to witness multi-colored skyscrapers rising high above the board. Using cards to restrict players' placement opportunities instead of allowing anyone to place anywhere was definitely a good design decision, and helps prevent the game from completely degenerating into stacking wars over a particular location. At 4 cards, your hand is just big enough to allow for some planning ahead, without being so big that you are overwhelmed with the available number of choices. I also like the strategic element the game introduces by forcing you to secretly choose in advance (for each phase) which size buildings you are going to place in that phase. It's a light bit of strategy which would hopefully help the game to hold up over a larger number of plays. Lastly, the simplicity of the game's scoring is refreshing when compared to many modern board games with very intricate scoring systems.  

Dislike: The plastic building colors are impressively ugly, with the exception of the black buildings. It's also difficult to assess at a glance how many stories a particular building is (as well as how many stories each player has within that building) since the "window" bulges on each of the buildings are somewhat difficult to see at a distance. No "friendly" ties (tying in a particular scoring category like tallest building on the board gives all tied players no points) means that Manhattan is very cutthroat in its scoring. Another aspect of Manhattan which adds to this cutthroat nature is that only the player who owns the top story of a building stack on the board gets points for that stack. These aspects of the scoring quickly lead to frustrating  exchanges between two players as they cap and re-cap each others buildings, gaining nothing in the process while another player who is being left alone builds a large lead. It's also easy for Manhattan to turn into a game of bashing the leader, as it's very easy to assess who has the most points in any given state of the game, and there's not much a player can do to defend himself against three other players building on top of his stacks. The only defense for the leader in this scenario is to hope that his opponents have bad cards for attacking his buildings. 

Overall: I'm not sure I really understand the strategy of Manhattan yet, so I am open to playing the game again. In both of the games I played, I felt like I had very little control over my fate. It seemed like the winner was mostly determined by which player got attacked the least.

Played the monster variant. It was decent, but we played a little incorrectly. The correct way would be much better. I don't see the regular game being much fun though.

I like Manhattan for its accessibility.  I also find the building placement due to the seating orientation to be a pretty clever mechanic.  However, there are two significant problems with the gameplay itself.  First is the obvious card draw.  It is usually fairly clear who you should be going after from round to round, but if you can't get the right card, there is not much you can do.  This leads to the second concern, that the game is too fragile and too dependent on the other people playing optimally.  If you happen to have someone who is oblivious to the score, very often he will undo the efforts to stop the leader from getting even more points.  A bad move on another's part could have a big impact on everyone else, and that could be a frustrating experience when you lose a game through no fault of your own.  I guess we can at least take comfort in knowing that it plays quick.

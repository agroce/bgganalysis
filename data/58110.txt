***Please note I have no original Horse Fever box*** The game will be sent in a generic box for shipping and storage but this will not be the Horse Fever game box. If having the Horse Fever game box is important please do not offer for this item.

This is the first edition with first edition components as per the link here. https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/72358/multilingua... Rules are English

Components are in very good condition however there are no blank, customisable cards which were originally with the 1st edition (though these appear to have been removed from the 2nd edition in any case) and no 1st player card (this does not affect gameplay assuming you are happy to use an alternative first player token!)

The game does include a 49 deck expansion- please follow the link here for photos of the expansion cards. https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3509147/andystal I cannot find any reference to this particular expansion so it may be fun trying to work out the rules!

I think this game would be a 9 or a 10 for me, if not for a few decisions that could make it drag with the wrong players.  After 1 play, it appears you need to play a 6-10 round game before the feast-or-famine mechanics produce any kind of close scoring, and I'd prefer 10.
Ultimately, I expect this game will stay in the low 7's on BGG, due to a significant amount of randomness in the game, but as a horse racing fan, I am not phased in the slightest.

We played the boardgame and I am really excited. The rules are not that clear and for the cards we had to look up a lot, but if you ignore these little problems a very exciting betting and racing game comes through. Too much luck? Come on, it's a betting on horses game, if everybody knew how to bet in real life, betting wouldn't exist. There is some controll, but you're never sure.

:d10-4:

Update: Despite the improvement with 4 players, my rating dropped from 6 to 4. The heavy dose of randomness doesn't bother me so much (it's a horse racing/betting game, after all), but it seems at odds with the interesting underlying game of incentive manipulation. There's too much to think about for it to be a light-hearted racing game, and there's too much luck for it to be a thinkier economic game.

Old Comment: Fun, but unbearably chaotic at 6 players. Seems like it would be best with 4.

There are some times while playing this my heart started beating faster and I was on the edge of my seat cheering my horse on. Fun game with betting on horses and tampering with horses. I like most of the mechanics and would like a little more diversity with some of the cards. Some more buying from players would be nice, I have yet to play a game where someone bought a card from someone else. Overall an exciting game to play every once and a while with family, friends, and gamers.

Oh man, this game is fun! I defy you to keep your seat when your longshot fix is neck and neck in the stretch. 

Dying to break out the poker chips and put some skin in the game. 

EDIT: Every single time this game is a blast, and it always goes right down to the wire, literally, with the winner determined at the finish line of the last race.

NOTE: I have removed everything having to do with VP's from the game. It was all clumsy and unnecessary. Most money at the end wins. This variant rates a perfect 10, minus maybe half a point because it would be nice to have a couple more horses in that deck.

One of the better horse racing games I've played.  It runs a little long with 6 because of all the difficult iconography on the cards.  We had to keep passing the rulebook around to understand what the cards did.

But the game was a fun with lots of cheering on card pulls and dice rolls.  Also, we got a kick out of owing the mob at the end and getting "eliminated".

Still, I can't rate it much higher than a 7 due to extreme luck factors.  It can be mitigated some by card play and carefully watching opponents card-play.  Maybe it could go up to to an 8, but likely firmly entrenched at a 7.

Genial sistema de simulación de carreras, de lo mejor que he visto como mecánica, en el juego familiar cualquiera puede ganar y en el juego avanzado la experiencia y tus estrategias pesan un poco mas, eso si la versión avanzada funciona bien hasta 4 para mas se hace muy lenta la fase de compra de cartas, las carreras de caballos no dejan indiferentes a nadie y es genial poder jugar un juego emocionante donde no tengas que freírte el cerebro pensando tu estrategia para sentirte inmerso en el, muy recomendable.

UPDATE: I lowered this to an 8.5.  I still think it is a great game, but the iconography and perhaps its length (not super long, but perhaps a little too long) mean that it doesn't get to the table as often as I'd hoped.  I still really really like the build up to the race, which makes it a real hoot once it gets underway!

Pros:

1) The two phases in each round are very different, but related and super cool.  You can buy horses, stables, actions to fix races, assistants, etc.  Then, you place your bets and run the race, which is based on probabilities and a bit of chance, but with all of the cards you bought factoring in.  This is a great design that works very very well.

2) The races are always a hoot.  It's like a party game mixed with a Euro, how is this possible?!

3) The game fits nicely with the theme.

4) The games are always close, but not so close that skill isn't a factor.  The game just seems very balanced.

5) There are a lot of choices in the first phases and there are multiple winning strategies

6) It plays well with every number of players I've tried (including two)

Cons:

1) I can never remember all of the symbols, so players are constantly referring to the rulebook

2) We never remember the auctions at the end of the round, so a reminder on the board would be nice.

3) I wish there was a way to avoid fouling up the rearranging of horse odds at the end of each race.  It always seems like this screws people up, but cannot think of a better way to do it.

Overall:

Every time that I have played this game, I have had a ton of fun.  Looking through the rulebook isn't a deal breaker; the rules are clear and organized by card type, so it doesn't take long to read through what four cards do.  Plus, you can remember what -some- of the symbols mean.  I finally bumped this to a nine, because there are very few games that I truly would never turn down, and this is one of them.

Horse Fever tries to pile too much stuff onto a very simple and fairly chaotic betting game. It gets overly fiddly and long as a result, and what should be a light-hearted sprint becomes quite a slog rather quickly. Looking at other games in the genre, Royal Turf clearly takes the cake.

*2nd edition*

Wow what a great game. The game has 2 different ways to play. A lighter family type game and a heavier gamer's board game. Both are terrific and play out very well.

The family game is very easy to pick up and teach and plays faster as well. Though it's still a lot of fun to play.

The board game varient is a lot meatier and adds a lot to the game. It becomes more strategic and has multiple strategies to go about, but there is luck involved. Afterall, this is a horse racing game.

Both games are totally unlike any other horse racing game that I've played. In this one you are trying to become the best and most famous gambler in town. There are a lot of different ways to go about this. Like buying assisants to help you, buying action cards to help and hinder the horses, completing goal card, buying stables and horses, buying cards from other players, taking loans from either the bank or the mob or both, but you better pay them back or you'll wind up dead and out of the game. Yes, it's a dirty crooked race game. You can do all sorts of nasty tricks. Like poisoning the horses, or injecting them with steroids, whipping the hell out of them, so they go faster and lots more.

Each player starts with a random character, of which each has a different starting revenue and special ability. These characters are actually on the sidelines, making bets on the horses, that they have rigged or tried to. It's not always successful.

Sure winning money is fun and will keep you in the game, but it's not the one with the most money that wins. It's the one who has gained the most victory points, after all of the races are finished. You get victory point by winning races, either win or show, or by buying stables.

I'd almost give this game a 10 if it weren't for the rule book. It's not bad, but it's not well laid out either and there are a lot of little symbols on the cards, that are confusing at first, but there's a nice little cheat sheet on the back of the rules booklet, to help out with this. Still it'll take a few games to get the hang of it all, but will surely be easier and play quicker, once you learn them. It's not that bad once you get the hang of it.

Overall this is a fantastic game. It really has that 1920's feel, of trying to rig races and betting on the winners. Lots of fun and laughs and it's a great game for everyone due to the varients. If you like horse racing games, betting games or both, then I'd highly recommend this game. I own both Turfmaster and Winner's Circle and love them both, but this one is just in a realm of it's own and unlike either of them.

Good horse racing bidding game.  You can play different type of cards on horses to increase or decrease is chance of winning the race.  I like the game but I think it's too long (over 2 hours) mainly due to the downtime when the players buy their cards.  New players don't know what the iconography on the cards means so they always have to check in the rulebook to decide which one of the four drawn to keep.  With experience players, this game will play much faster.

Too complex and too long for what it is, and the terrible iconography affects both things for the worse. There is a lot of randomness and chaos, but oddly the same few horses tend to win the races or be among the first three during the entire game. I understand that this type of luck-based game, spiced with plenty of "take that!" cards, has its audience and I'm just not part of it, but I see no reason to play this instead of Knizia's "Winner's Circle", even though I'm not a fan of that, either. And the horrible wooden horses plus the unattractive artwork that tries to be funny certainly don't make me want to give it another chance.

Reminds me a lot of cheaty mages.

I only played the family version, wich was pretty boring. Because then it is almost a pure luck game. With the "advanced" rules it might become more interesting.

The race itself was pretty anti-climatic i found, for you just draw cards and roll dice.. players cannot influence the the outcome anymore. So you sit & watch what happens.. hm..

RATING: 5
Way too long for what it is.  Tedious in the long run.

The whole design generally works well, but the game is underdeveloped in several areas.  Some elements of the game are doubtful - some cards/mechanics are rarely used/useless, some cards (or group of cards) are clearly better than others, some options are not exercised at all or difficult to exercise (because the other player must agree to the deal).  These are designer's errors, but the main problem is still the game length and this overwhelming feeling that it drags on and on...

Some nice idea: mandatory minimum bid based on the number of gained VPs so far.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2014)

What a surprise! As I hate racing games I didn’t want to play Horse Fever, but I had fun playing it, perhaps because racing itself is a very small part of the game. There are other aspects you have to manage (you have to buy many kind of  cards and fix the race, buy/sell VPs). There are lots of “take that” but it is fun. It is way too long with 6 players. I think it is best with 4 players and it still can be very long for what the game offers. I feel this is its main weakness. Its other big weakness is the iconography. It isn’t that bad, however for the new players it will drag down the game as every time a player makes a purchase, he has to look up the icons in the game manual adding massive downtime to the game. I’m also worried that some cards seem to be very powerful and unbalanced AND the target cards seem very hard to accomplish. 

The horses minis don’t resemble any horse I know :D, but the game components and art are great. Love that there are lots of initial characters so each game can be very different.

I have only played the boardgame part of Horse Fever.

Bottom line, Horse Fever has been the first horse racing game I have enjoyed, miles better than Long Shot. For now it is a borderline 6.0 for me. I don’t think I will ever buy it.

Fun and charming. Skip the basic game and go straight to the full version. Overall it might run a bit longer than you'd expect, but there isn't much downtime. The variety of items to buy and cards to play add drama to the races. Plus I'm a fan of the art style.

RATING: 5
Opinion based on playing the 'Board Game' mode. 

So these [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1054346/horse-fever]meeples[/url] are horses? I've heard them being called icebears, hyaenas and boats (when flipped upside down), but I still like them. Love the wacky art and quality components, dislike the game. 

Perhaps this is because I'm not into gambling and the thrill of gambling is what this game is all about. This game has a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15817/manila]Manila[/url] vibe, so if you like that game, you might like this game as well. I find this game too lengthy given the chaos and light game weight. And while I understand the necessity of the Auction phase, this even further lengthens and drags out the game. The game is cumbersome and inelegant in its design and comes with a hefty doses of rules and icons, which is just too much for what this game pretends to be. Finally when it comes down to a tie this game lets you win when you are a: short sighted, heavy, spot faced, short, long armed person. Is that a bad joke or plain silliness? Terrible way to end a two hour game but the only memorable feature, because it made me wonder if the designer wanted to give himself an advantage (*snarl*).

In Horse Fever players are primarily unscrupulous betters who will buy stables and horses, fix races, take out loans from the mob, send goons to mug their neighbors for a couple hundred bucks - anything to help win a bet. The premise is great and the basic play elements are mostly solid, but the game has significant flaws that keep it from being as good as it can be. And that is disappointing, because the good stuff is really good.

Each turn has four phases: purchase cards, place bets, race horses and auction points. The first three phases make sense. You can purchase a variety of cards that give you horses, assistants, end game goals and action cards which enable race fixing/influencing. Each player then places two bets and between bets the action cards are placed face down so you can see who's influencing which horse. The cards are turn up and the race begins. Horses have odds based on past performance. Cards are flipped that move horses according to their odds and dice add a bit more uncertainty to the outcome. The 1st place bets pay out by the horse's odds and winners get 3 points, the bets to show pay 2:1 and get 1 point. And then, of course, comes the part where the bank buys a point in a Dutch auction and then sells a point in an English auction. (Say what??) Repeat again until every player has been start player once or twice (short or long game).

The main flaw with the game is length. While the game is good chaotic fun, there is not enough here to justify a game over one hour long. A "short" game with 5 players can easily take two hours. It just takes a while to figure out what cards to purchase and what to bet and where to place the cards based on the betting. Also, you win with points - not money - and you get points by winning bets, owning stables, or meeting the goals on your secret target cards. The only thing money is good for at the end of the game is buying that last point from the bank and only one player can do that. The auction feels totally out of place with this otherwise thematic game. Also the card symbols, while seemingly clear at first, take some getting used to and sometimes conflict in ways that are not adequately covered by the rules (of the 1st edition, at any rate). For a game that should be about simply betting and manipulating outcomes, the length, the rules, and the weird auction phase all undermine an otherwise good thing.

Horse Fever is an entertaining game that revolves around bidding on the right horses, and influencing the performance on horses you either want to win or lose. Comes with a fairly simple family variant, but also with a more complex advanced version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Horse Fever is a spiced up [gameid=1382]. It's more thematic, more complicated, longer, more options but not necessarily more influence. While [gameid=1382] is about group think and makes it very hard to push a horse into payout with a single bet on it, Horse Fever is more about estimating probabilities correctly and taking the right amount of risk.
A few unrefined elements keep it from getting a better rating. Namely, the restricted element of purchasing stables (usually once or maximum twice per game per player), the trivial goal cards and a few take-that helper cards targetted against single players. For my taste, it's too much about the experience and not enough about gameplay for the time and effort needed.

I thought the game play was ok, but the icons were not very intuitive. We were constantly looking up the meaning for icons in the rules creating a lot of down time and this took away much of the fun for me at least. A game about horse racing should be quick and fun, not seem like work.

A very entertaining take on horse racing and an enjoyable game as well. The game is somewhat let down by unclear rules and some baad descisions regarding information shown on the cards in an effort to be language independent (necessitating a lot of rules look-ups) and some unclear art on the target cards, but if you see past that, this game is a blast.

Two big plusses in its favour are the hillarious artwork and tounge-in-cheek horse and stable names.

Even with lukewarm first-timers, after the first few rounds it's almost impossible not to have an excited group regardless of age or gender- cheering and cursing at tiny wooden horselike things on a cardboard. Really clever mix of game elements, with surprisingly lot ways to win for a race game. 'Cause it's not one. Having the best stables and best horses won't win the game for anyone, but smart bets, bluffs and fixing races could. Very casual, yet intense game at the same time, and the wacky illustrations of Giulia Ghigini make a great atmosphere.

Beautiful art and nice production.  I appreciate the fact that the designer was able to take a horse racing theme and actually develop a story around it and a sense of growth for the stable owners.  The races are somewhat exciting and I enjoyed all of the buying options to soup up your team.  My biggest problem is that the game seems to drag a bit towards the end.  Despite all the moving parts it's just not deep enough to warrant a 2-hour playing time.

Grande delusione questo party game che pensavo essere un tantino più profondo. Le dinamiche del gioco sono semplici, ma i simboli sulle carte necessitano di una costante (specie per le prime partite) ricorsa al manuale. La strategia di gioco viene spesso annullata dalla casualità della pesca delle carte o peggio ancora del lancio del dado. Molto simpatici i nomi dei personaggi e i disegni sulle carte, ma non bastano per farmi apprezzare questo gioco.

Gets your adrenaline pumping. But something keeps naging me. There's two horse abilities which are much more superior than others and if you don't get either of those its hard to pinpoint the winner. It also seemed strange with the amount of turns. 5 seemes like a bit too short as the game starts to get going then, but 10 seems like 2-3 rounds toooo long.

The aim of the game is to have fun, and it's perfect for that.
The game is good not only to laugh with your friends but is also valuable as a boardgame 'cos I found the game mechanics nice and well balanced.
After a couple of games I think you may choose different strategies to try to win. Although the luck factor is clearly present (we're talking about horse races after all!) it is not a key-factor: a good strategy could balance a bad luck (if you are dogged by bad luck may be you won't win, but...).
I suggest to play it as a party game with a little variation of the "party game rules": 1) bet in two round just like the "board game rules" and let the bookmaker draw and use after the first round of betting  number of "action card" depending on the number of players; 2) keep the different quotation for the stables (and their variability) as in the "board game rules".
You'll find yourself shouting as an ultimate supporter during the races...
Enjoy

RATING: 5
I've only played the family game, which is *very* light. And too light for its length, which is one race (10 mins or so) for each player in the game. A player's control over a race is limited to two action cards each, with each card placed against a horse and revealed before the race starts. The cards are the normal go faster and or get hobbled variety. You get VPs if a horse you bet on places (if you said place) or wins (if you said win). The game starts off blandly for the first few races until you have some (randomly decided) leaders in VPs, then it's a matter of hobbling the horses that the leaders are betting on, and betting on other stuff. And then it devolves to turn order, because the leaders (if they're going later in the order) can at least place one bet on a horse which others are going for. So it's random with a catch-the-leader mechanism, meaning things should roughly be equal towards the end where the randomness of the races (which are decided by a deck and dice) should decide the winner. Which ties it back to my first statement ... it's too light for its length. Having said all that, the advanced game may save it, but haven't had a chance to try it.

La sorpresa dello Spiel 2009. Opera prima del duo Silva-Tucci Sorrentino e dell'editore Cranio Creations, il gioco stupisce per almeno un paio di motivi:

Meccaniche freschissime e originali: non ricordo un racing game fatto così. Tutto si incastra bene: fase di gestione (scuderie, alleati, carte "sgambetto", ecc.) fase scommesse e fase finale (nella quale si "caricano" i cavalli di carte evento che influiranno sulla prestazione in gara) fanno montare una tensione che si scioglie tutta insieme in gara, quando ogni carta rivelata rende la casa una vera sala scommesse, con urla e imprecazioni di ogni genere. 

Veste grafica: anche se esempi recenti dicono il contrario, la pochezza grafica è quasi un marchio di fabbrica degli editori esordienti, forse più interessati a presentare eleganti meccaniche e fluido gameplay. Horse Fever non appartiene a questa categoria: la brava Giulia Ghigini ha reso il gioco un piccolo gioiello, calandolo col suo tratto nel sordido mondo delle corse di cavalli di inizio Novecento.

3/4 tension plus 1/4 pure fun with a glaze of some decent strategy (in the full game). If nobody chokes on the tiny paper-money or the load of symbols, you will not do anything wrong in bringing this game on the table. Multilingual (and latin, yeah!) card names are also nice ingrediences.

This game has some potential, but has a lot of beginners mistake. Just a few of them: the art work is very special, something you either like or dislike, there is no inbetween. Everybody has a character, but they didn't print the starting capital or special ability on it, so you have to look it up in the rules and remember your special ability. Too much stuff going on: we almost had to look up every action card, this is bad. Rules in English or French or not well translated and unclear.

Only horse racing game I've ever played, so I can't make any comparisons.  But we've had a good time with this one so far (only played the family game to date).  It has a very high degree of luck (as with actual horse racing), but you can 'help' your luck by playing action points to help your horse and hurt the horse the other guy wants to win.  I plan to add the other components/rules (decks of cards) one at a time as we play the next games.

Hands down my kid's favorite card is:  the hot pepper! :)

1 play, 4 players, 4 rounds., advanced game ("normal")

Given how much I enjoyed playing it, it's quite a low rating. That's because the winning conditions make no sense to me. The game is fun, engaging, hilarious and tense. The core game consists of betting money on horses and playing bonus and malus cards on different horses. It's pretty smart actually: first everybody places one bet, then they play cards which show totally different motives and then the second round of betting shows what's really going on. If you win you increase your money. 

But I am lost with the victory point system which disconnect the basic idea of betting with money and obscures what is best about this game (see above). 
- If this is a betting game, then money should matter, not VPs. 
- Goal cards have no connection with the rest of the game.  They give you victory points for various sets (like most horses, most stables or most goal cards
- dutch and english auction for VPs. WTF? What has this to do with the betting game?

I should probably try it again with the family game , though I really liked the horse cards and their effect on bidding. There is a fun betting game hidden inside unnecessary euro ballast. 


EDIT: played again. enjoyed the game. still think the scoring is stupid, not related to theme and just ugh. The goal cards should be thrown out of the game. (For the record I did win with them, but I didn't feel I actually was the best player).

RATING: 7.5
Horse Fever isn't the most elegant of games - it has unintuitive iconography and its gameplay could have been a lot more streamlined - but it still has a certain charm about it. Strangely, it's all about VP at the end of the day, and players obtain them via betting in races. Of course, things aren't always so straightforward and a fair amount of bluffing, sabotaging and collusion is bound to occur as players rig the race in their favour.

There's a decent amount of strategy involved, although getting Target cards can be a risky gamble - they've been a dud in some games, but spectacular in others. The minimum bet rule is also pretty smart as it requires successful players to naturally raise the stakes and obtain more money. 

The easy-listening jazzy soundtrack evokes a 1920s bar-room atmosphere, although I was expecting something more intense. 2P games lack the element of bluffing while 5P games can drag, so the sweet spot for this game would be with 3 and 4 players. A good game to play to pass an hour plus, but players have to be prepared for swings of luck.

Entertaining betting game involving horse racing. Includes several variants regarding game weight and length.

Should be played over the full length (the short game lacks some strategic depth).

First, the art for this game is amazing.  Clearly Giulia Ghigini loves Edward Gorey as much as I do.

The game itself has some really solid ideas, but it also has some problems as well.  I feel that there is a good game here, but it really could have used some serious development.  

The big problem is that it is too long (90 min is a bold faced lie), and the game tends to run ahead of what you are capable of controlling.

First, I think that there should be three buys per race. I appreciate the author's intent to make you feel like there are too many things that you'd like to do without having a way to do them all, but I also feel that striving to design a more inclusive game is more important. It is also clear that more rounds have to be added so that despite being able to do much in a round you can still get the growth of how and what to buy (the story arc of the design). If you could do more between races then it would allow for an increased pace, with more lively results while still following the growth arc.

That way you'd get all the joy of the full game in 4 or 5 turns (rather than the unruly 10 turns offered).  As fun as the first few turns are, the bloom fades on the rose come turn 6 when you realize you have to go through this process all over again.

Second, I think the VP "target" cards are problematic, either they are all bunk/impossible (most notably the stable VPs, too long to go into here) or it is a race to the bottom with players outspending each other for no reasonable reward (ties benefit neither party) more interesting would be if ties benefited both and then you see who tries to screw the other out of it.  These cards also create a strategy on rails, so if you can attempt to achieve your goal you will, and then that is the entire focus of what you do the entire game, over and over again, better to have short little victories.

Third, the iconography just isn't up to snuff, you really have to look up every single card.  That drags the game down massively.

All in all, decent, but it could have been great.  For now I'm sticking with Longshot.

Not bad for what it is, but it feels random and passive for long stretches of gameplay. Which probably means it's a good simulation of horse racing, but not that much fun as a board game. The game's length is ludicrous, making a house rule mandatory.

This is a game that I desperately want to love, but has undeniable problems. The iconography is still perplexing and most rounds pretty much all of the players will be looking at the rules or crib sheets to see what the cards they're looking at do.

But then you get to the betting and then the race and it all seems worthwhile. Everyone's shouting for the horses they own or bet on to do well and groaning when the dice roll goes wrong. Trouble is, I'm not sure what crowd this fits into. It's a bit messy for non-gamers as the icons are just confusing, and there isn't really enough strategy for hardcore gamers.

This game has very humorous and fun theme, art, and style but is a bit too lucky and short on content for it to be something I would want to play all that often.

This is a betting game, we are all gamblers betting on horse races.  Each turn players buy cards from several stacks from actions to assistants to horses themselves which have a variety of effects on the races when played.  Then players bet on horses to win or to show with bets to win having higher payouts in both money and victory points.  Then cards are drawn from a movement deck where most commonly the horses with the higher odds of winning (and lower payouts) will move further and 2 dice are rolled that move a random 1 or 2 horses an extra space forward.  And of course the cards played during that round can alter all of this in different ways.

While I understand that any game based on betting on a horse race like this one needs a decent amount of luck to work it's not something I'm a huge fan of.  While most of the movement cards move the horses with the highest odds of winning forward further there are still a lot of cards in the movement deck that move the other horses further forward and the sprint dice just add a ton of other luck to it.  The cards help you corral this some but I'm just not a huge fan of games where the luckiest player wins more often than not.

The other problem I have is the small amount of variety in this game.  It looked like there would be a ton but in a 4-player game with 4 turns (turns equal to number of players) we went through all the horses, assistants, goals, and stable owner cards before the end of the game and a lot of the cards do very similar things.  With 5 or 6 players there would be even less stuff to go through.  Money also seemed very plentiful in this game as long as you don't make gigantic losing bets (if you place a bet to show in this game you have a 3 out of 7 chance of winning) making it easy to buy whatever you want whenever you want and the loan cards worthless.  Meanwhile the victory points are extremely tight, something I'm never a huge fan of.  You can only get them with winning bets (3 for a bet to win and 1 for a bet to show) and buy one each turn.  The goal cards give you bonus points but there are only 6 different goals, I think, and they aren't very interesting.  They're all just "have the most/least of something".

What I do like about this game though is the great theme, art, and style.  It is goofy and fun and we had a good laugh at many of the cards.  It also plays reasonably quick once you learn the symbols and don't need to look up every card you draw being as there are only rounds equal to the player count.  It certainly isn't poorly designed, it's just not a design I'm fond of, but for a quick, light, funny, and fun game I would play it occasionally.

Fun management/betting game, full of dirty tricks to have the horse(s) you betted on winning the races.
Original artwork, a few mechanics are a clear tribute to Princes of Florence (which is a nice touch).
Maybe not perfectly balanced and luck dependant, but after all this kind of games is not about balancement, it's about fun, so what else could you expect?
Many ways to prevent the "runaway leader" problem, on the other side, a few mistakes in the beginning and it's easy to fall behind in the race for victory.
Take it as a lighthearted game and you will have fun with it.
As a first debute in game designing and publishing, very good job!

It's funny that I happened to play Horse Fever the same month as [thing=38194][/thing].  They both involve secret better and secretly influencing competitors, but Horse Fever is about horse racing and takes probably 4 times as long.  Horse Fever adds unique powers (via starting characters, assistants, and horses) and gives you different incentives because each horse can be owned by a player.  

The main thing that differentiates this from Cheaty Mages is that the bets aren't secret, and the order of bets is very important.  First, there are a limited number of available bets per horse, so not every player can bet on the same horse.  Secondly, one round of bets are made before influencing cards are played, and then a second round of bets are made after the influencing cards.  So depending on other peoples bets and their card placement, the second round of betting can be very different.

It was a fun betting game with some interesting moments, but I felt like it was [b]a little too random for a 1.5-2 hour strategy game[/b] and the game can be approximately replicated with Cheaty Mages.

I can tell I'm going to have a lot of fun with this game. After just one solo game to get the rules down, I've already found it tense. I also think it's more of a thematic experience than most may give it. More than any other horse-racing game, it creates the tension of watching and screaming for your horse to stretch that neck forward.

I give it a 7.5 right off. I suspect my rating will improve with multi-player sessions.

Unplayably tedious. The game revolves around placing bets on horses to win or place that then charge up a track. The game adds buying race fix cards, various types of horse penalties and random 'sprint dice' which can give horse a small extra boost. Players can own multiple stables (unbalanced) and purchase horses with bonuses to use. The fact that the last 4 pages of the manual are dedicated to defining all the bonus cards and their exceptions should have been a hint. This game adds layer upon layer of unnecessary and unwanted chrome, but remains strictly inferior to the faster-playing Royal Turf.

Quite fun racing game. Problem is that one player can run away with it if he is lucky in the beginning. Therefore, opt for shorter game variant and play multiple times instead (if you wish). In fact, as a short(ish) filler this is very good.

Apuestas de carreras de caballos. 2 Fases de compra por turno (2 acciones, 1/4 ayudante, 1/4 objetivo o 1/4 caballo en cada fase). Se colocan las cartas de caballo. Apuesta obligatoria minima 100xpv. Se colocan las de accion. Apuesta no obligatoria con las mismas condiciones. Carrera: carta de movimiento y dados. Se paga/cobran las apuestas y se actualiza ranking de caballos. Subasta holandesa e inglesa: se venden y compran PV. Un poco coñazo on la simbología. La mecánica y emoción de las carreras esta bien conseguida,hay que valorarlo en una segunda partida.

One incomplete play, Essen 2009. I suspect after a few more plays the intellectual section of the game will be so familiar that it becomes the prelude to the race. Up to that point, the perception is that the race forms a chaotic coda to the intellectual section.

I rate this after one play of the full game.
This could be a fast paced betting game with some luck in the races but also some ways to influence the luck. Unfortunately it lacks all the fastness it would need to accept the level of luck involved. A bad sign language requires you to look up almost every single card (and there's many of them). So the game drags on and on. Once I discovered, that it's almost impossible to actually influence the races I lost interest completely.
Bad. Especially because it could have been much better with a little streamlineing. Pity for the good graphics.

What to make of this game? It's fun and wacky, but that clashes with some pretty fiddly rules. And then there's the symbol-language on the cards which makes you flip through the rule book all the time.
The strongest aspect of this game is how it captures the race feeling, how you end up standing up from your chair cheering your horse. And I guess in order to get the most out of Horse Fever, you better not overanalyze, better not be too eager to score those victory points, but just go for the fun.

In a few words, too complicated for what it is: too many little details for just betting on horse racing.

The ideas underlying the game are good and it is actually quite exciting to follow the race itself, this is the best part of the game. 

But before and after this there is too much management of cards, actions and so for that slow down the game.
If you are looking for a few exciting moments and don't mind this kind of boring activity in between, then HF is probably for you.

Quite random and fiddly but fun horse race betting game. Players begin the round by buying cards (action cards, horses, assistants, etc) and then bet money on what horse should win. Then a number of action cards are played that might enhance or decrease the chances for a specific horse, and then a second bet is placed.
The horses race according to cards drawn from a race deck, and the number of spaces a horse goes forward depends on its current odds.
What's interesting is that it's not "most money" that's the winner - money is merely the oil to keep the game going. Each time you hit with a bet you get victory points, and it's the one with the most VPs at the end who wins.

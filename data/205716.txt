RATING: 3
One of the most painful boardgaming experiences for a long time. Over four hours of negotiating, or should I say arguing, about things that did not feel very significant. Or maybe the correct word is interesting. 

It is obvious what you are supposed to achieve as a team in the game but when everyone is promoting their own agenda, the whole thing becomes a mess. Every decision takes too long and there is very little progress in the game to keep you interested in what is happening on the board. At least in our game all energy was lost in pointless arguments. Although this might be exactly what the game is aiming at. We even had people calling each other idiots and telling them to fuck themselves. 

Then there is a traitor who cannot really play the role because all actions are public. The best you can do as a traitor is to play along and hope other players mess it up themselves when pursuing their own secret needs.

Personally I like negotiation games but this was too much. The game itself was not interesting enough to warrant such a long argumentation rounds.

This is right up my alley, but it just took too long to have replayability.  The mechanics are all great, and the traitor aspect is very well done.  I don't play much/any netrunner, but it was still a good game.  If you can shorten the play time, it's a winner.

This is a unique game, very difficult and greed can quickly end the game.  I like the theme, but not sure how much overall i enjoyed the game.  Still would like to play more to get a better feel.

One of the best games I have ever played. The game we got through was 4 hours long with zero down time. I feel like the game would be 60-90 minutes if you played it without talking, but that wouldn't be the game as it should be. The game is really a debate game built on top of a betrayal euro like SOC. This makes the game so intense. There was one card play where a friend and I argued about team direction for a half hour. I have never played another game like it. Top 10 material for me, and I'm guessing in the future this will be a priority play for me when I have a large enough group.

I normally really enjoy the kind of games where you can "create a story" like game of thrones the boardgame or megacivilization. I feel this one is missing that, is very economical and few players are going to win and in the last few turns you know that you are not going to, but i don't find i can create my own goals with this one. So nice but not the best.

If you ever looked at cyber-punk distopias and thought "man, I'd love to be an ethically questionable mega-corporation!" then this is your opportunity to live out that dream!
New Angeles is a tense game of negotiations that will, without fail, devolve into paranoia and petty rivalries.

RATING: 9
I don’t like games that last too long as after the first hour or so they tend to become quite boring and I lose interest in them: usually if you lag behind you have few opportunities - if any - to catch up, hence you just waste the next few hours doing something just because you’re still in the game but know well too well you’ve already been written off.

Then I played New Angeles and enjoyed it so much: it isn’t the usual brain burner you expect when you play a heavy game; it’s rather an exercise in negotiation and social skills, with a heavy dose of manipulation and phony assertions, such as «the best we can do now is this and this: sure, it also benefits me a little but let’s see the whole picture and focus on the greater benefits we all will enjoy from this». This is the stuff good and memorable games are made of.

Because of this, alliances ebb and flow in New Angeles, which also allows the players who struggle behind to still brood hopes to win: not only do several assets target the leading player but, due to the «just do better than your rival» mechanism, a lagging player might also have no need to catch up as long as his competitor does even worse than he does.

Theme also drips with every card in this game: cyberpunk is not a genre I like but it really matches New Angeles’ mechanisms insomuch that everything in this game feels like it’s made to add flavor to it. Sometimes you also feel like the players contracting and taking decisions are the city council, which makes for some funny moments as you remind to the others the time when...

All in all, New Angeles is a negotiation masterwork.

The next iteration of BSG, Dead of Winter, but the game does have a different feel than its predecessors.  It does seem to easy to win as the federalist, at least in your first few games, because players don't understand the balance of greed vs damage to the city.  The theme is really cool, and the overall production of the game is top notch.  Probably needs 5 or 6 players to truly shine however.

Seems way too long as for what it is. 4-5h of doing exactly the same things over and over. It was fun for the first 2-3 rounds then it was just painful to negotiate all the time. All in all I really like this game because in general I like negotiations but this one is just to long. If you can shorten it to 4 rounds total without losing on balance I would give it higher rating (although considering Federalist role I don't think it will be balanced).

RATING: 3
Long, random if so many ways, dry and dull. Your choice is driven by the suits of cards you draw and then further restricted by which ones you get in the suit. Asset cards are wildly varied in power. It's all about negotiation with presumably tensions from not being sure what others are really up to - but i didn't care. Not enough interesting  decisions, not enough control. Maybe it isn't enough 'co op' as everyone is clearly out for themselves, not just a traitor to find. Would never play this over BSG. Might shine with the right group, one without me in it. Only negotiation I'd want is playing something else.

I'm usually not a big fan of negociation games, but I quite enjoyed this semi-cooperative game. I really like co-ops where you not only have to beat the possible traitor but also have to complete a certain objective in addition to it, in this case finish with more capital than a specific player. I also enjoyed the offer/counteroffer system to determine which action gets played on each turn. I found some of the asset cards a bit swingy, some of them are much more useful than others depending on the status of the game and I feel like the traitor can be easy or hard to beat just based on which faction he or she has. Despite these minor concerns, it's really interesting game that I would definitely play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fantastic negotiation game grounded in a dynamic, ever shifting board. Secret agendas, vocal sparring, and direct interaction make this a treat. The victory condition of having a rival and just needing to edge them out in scoring provides an exceptional atmosphere and subtle undercurrent of skullduggery.

The two issues I have with the game are that it can go extremely long. It felt satisfying and enjoyable throughout, but it makes it a harder sell to get to the table with limited time. Also, the investment cards seemed somewhat swingy. They rely on manipulating the board state and you can luck into (or out of) solid gains based solely on your two options dealt. This happened once during my first play, which isn't too terrible of a frequency.

I'm a little conflicted. This is a great game in a lot of ways. I love the paranoia, the rivals system, the federalist, there's a ton of overarching ideas that make this game fantastic. The detailed execution, however, has some significant flaws that get in its own way. 
Ultimately, I will semi-happily overlook these flaws for the sake of an experience as unique and rewarding as this.

One of the best gaming experiences I have had.  First game for all 6 so it started kind of slow and unsure, but near the end we sussed out the federalist just as she thought we were too far gone to avoid collapsing, we came together as a giant team to save the city on the final turn, all 5 other players thought they had a chance to win, scored kept changing hands during final score phase, and 3 players leapt up victoriously.  Such a great ending to a great game.  Not for everyone as the mechanics really require negotiation and the ability to sell your plan, but this has instantly become one of my favorite games.

This was an amazing experience! Screw the game mechanics, they're by no means bad and I actually liked how things work out when it comes to placing figures and drawing action cards and moving stuff around on the board etc. But the heart of New Angeles lies within the whole deception, bluffing and voting part of the game. This is definitely one of the best games of the genre.

my immediate reaction was: its not as immersive as bsg and therefore not as good.
it would be nice if there was an in-game reason to dramatically reveal yourself as the traitor because, I mean, isn't that the whole point of playing traitor??

2nd play: i was thinking about this game all wrong. you're not supposed to give a shit about the city!! not having a traitor really ups the scummy corporate intrigue level, and thats actually THE WHOLE POINT... you can really revel in your role as a disgusting capitalist pig, forcing the masses to suffer plagues & power outages while you and the other elites bicker over who gets to put their name on the next fucking vanity project

a lot of design choices could be better and the negotiation is a bit too freeform perhaps, but... i kinda like it

Example for all the money: 6 player game. There were many protests in the New Angeles. NBN was trying 4th time to persuade other corporations that we have to deal with the protests. I promised, and persuaded all other corporations  that we will vote for NBN emergency card in next round, everybody was happy. My counter offer won 3rd time in a row. The asset card I won by that offer had something like "discard this card and take emergency cards from 2 other corporations". Well, one of the stolen one was from NBN, and everybody else voted for it in the next round, granting me another asset! Wicked :)

1st session took us 5 hours with rules explanation. The neogatiations were amazing and we had great time.

Amazing experience. Reasons why I don't give it 10 stars are:
-1 Because the Federalist will have hard time to stay undercover once the players are more experienced in this game.
-1 I feel like some corporations have harder way to get to capital than others. For example Melange Mining has huge credit gain, if the teamwork is good.

Co-opetition negotiation game set in the dystopian future of Android. Try and save the city, fulfill contracts, call your friends the Federalist, root out hippies, heal the sick, and drop giant mech police from the sky! The models in this game are unnecessarily good. Also, I played a game where nobody won. 3 people tied and the we beat the Federalist. Hilarity was had by all.

Hidden traitor and secret winning conditions/missions are two of my favourite "mechanisms" ever. I like other similar games a lot better (Dead of Winter and Shadows over Camelot for example).

End game scoring here is interesting because, as long as the threat track doesn't terminate the game early and cause you all to lose (except federalist who wants that to happen) then your score is irrelevant as long as you beat the rival company printed on your secret objective cards, beat them by 1, beat them by 20 doesn't matter, all that matters is you have more capital than them. 

This makes the whole game interesting as to be honest you don't really care about your score and so you don't build and engine and keep pushing it for points, as there is no point. you have to look up and see the state of the city and co-operate with each other and sort out issues before the anarcs take over.

It feels a little like Battelstar galactica but without all the mathematics and with out a single player actually being able to solo a challenge... you HAVE to work together. After one play i do think I prefer Battlestar, however I would not be adverse to more plays of this, indeed some of the more subtle cards, or cards we dismissed as not powerful enough in the first game have shown just how important they can be and with 4 experienced players I think it will be a very different game.

RATING: 8
For negotiation games, this is pretty good, and I'm not that good at negotiation.  This is a long game.  3 hours for 5 new players and we only got to the 2nd demand phase.

Rules aren't too difficult, there is a good amount of theme, and enough moving parts and hidden agendas that everyone is looking around at everyone as a possible Federalist.  I enjoy the rival and the investment cards.  Rival makes it very interesting and easy to not care about most people, while the Investment card give you an interesting way to make a bunch of capital, even if it goes against your primary goal.  

As for some negatives, if I play this 4-5 times, I'm not sure there would be much 'game' left to explore.

Some of the Asset cards seem to be slightly overpowered, especially those that give another player a whole bunch of cards, which they'll primarily use the next turn to just make going against them prohibitively expensive. 

This is a long game, and may not have as big of a payoff at the end for some players.  However, it is primarily a negotiation game, and I'm not sure those really offer a big payoff anyway.

A quatre pour notre première partie. 
2h30-2h45 mise en place et explications comprises.

Verdict: On en redemande !!!!

un super jeu de négociation empreint de coopératif où chacun joue au final pour sa gueule. Je trouve que c'est la meilleure synthèse qu'on puisse faire de ce jeu. Ajoutez à cela la présence d'un félon, et vous pouvez cerner toutes les imbrications que la mécanique génère dans l'esprit des joueurs.

Le jeu est au final très fluide et les règles digestes, les tours s'enchaînent bien. Après il faut pas jouer en paralisys analisys c'est sûr...En tous les cas, je pense que maintenant qu'on connaît le jeu, on peut se le faire sans crainte à 5 ou 6 joueurs sans qu'on dépasse les 2h30 avec mon groupe de joueurs tout du moins...

Le thème est vraiment sympa, et le jeu nous met bien dedans. Les différents pouvoirs des corporations sont raccords avec ce qu'elles sont. Le très grand nombre de cartes "avoirs" promet une variété de possibilités monumentales, qui font que aucune partie ne se ressemblera (+ les cartes de mises en place qui diffèrent d'une partie sur l'autre). L'imbrication des mécanismes et de l'univers est je trouve top.

Le graphisme du jeu et des cartes est au petits oignons ...et je parle pas des figurines qui rendent bien sur le plateau.

Franchement après cette première partie, je cherche un défaut au jeu, je n'en trouve pas...et en plus pour le coup, le jeu est vraiment très original, moi qui me plaint que tous les jeu se ressemblent un peu en ce moment.

New Angeles est un jeu de société très vivant pour les participants, on échange beaucoup verbalement, on s'arnaque, on va dans le même sens, on s'oppose, on s'arrange,on se méfie, ça vit à fond durant la partie. Franchement on est dedans ! Pas vu le temps passer. que du plaisir.

This game reminds BSG gameplay with DoW victory conditions.

BSG is my favorite traitor game and this one captures a similar feeling gameplay except with negotiations every turn. That part is great. The personal victory conditions are also very cool and better balanced than the DoW ones. No random dice to screw you here too. The theme is excellent and everything makes sense

My main gripe with the game is a similar one I have with DoW. I'm not convinced that the "traitor" role is balanced compared to the others. Seems way too easy to win with it or to have someone who isn't going to win.. spike the game for everyone else. Also the game is best at 5-6, which will probably take ~4h.

Negotiation is my least favorite mechanic and while this game has many other aspects to it, that mechanic is a core one. I'm not likely to join in big games of this one more than maybe 1-2 times

7 if it turns out the traitor role is balanced.. otherwise I give it a 6. Preliminary 6.5 right now. I could see this game being rated much higher for people who are into this genre

Started setting up and explaining rules at 7PM, started playing about 7:45, game ended about 11:15;  With a full 6 players I guess that's not too bad.  Have to say, about halfway through the game I was done and just wanted to move things along.  Its a cool game, but I think I'd really have to be talked into playing again, just too long.  
Good: Theme, art, miniatures.
Bad: cards(and text) are too small, people kept having to pick them up, hold it an inch from there face and read them (none of us are over 40, so our eyes are good).  "Whats that card say again?", was heard numerous times.

So it's overlong, which is hardly any surprise given it's an FFG design. The victory conditions are also suspect (ditto). But if you want a 3-hour cutthroat negotiation game, you could do a lot worse--but that's awfully niche. I like that niche, but not many people do.

I have no idea why this gets that much attention, as there's not much to it. In fact, there's hardly a game behind all the stuff...

All you do is making or supporting an offer, where the board and all tiles / minis are just a visualization of what happens. The game takes way too long for what it is and to me it's just extremely boring and repetetive.

There is a lot I really didn't enjoy about this. Firstly, I would say that I think the mechanics would be more fun with 6 players, however that would balloon the playing time and I had a 5 hour session with only 4, so that's a bad value proposition in my book.
Assets are often not very good and just end up as a wall of tiny text that everyone has which you will have a hard time keeping track of- not only because there are so many on the table but because they change hands fequently.
Mainly the dynamics boil down almost exclusively to the Main Offer/Counteroffer. There is no point in NOT making a counteroffer if you can because players can only ever choose between 2 options- so why not make one of them yours if you only have to spend 1 or 2 cards to do it? And in a 4-player game, spending 1 or 2 cards to counteroffer will happen 50% of the time. But this mainly limits the options for all of the players between something that might be good for the board and something that is good for you. Worse yet, the main offer can never be changed so having to choose between 2 options that are bad for you happens frequently and is not fun or interesting.
Essentially, the game's most interesting element boils down to every player making an A or B vote that also has a chance of being invalidated by the next player who votes for another offer. Few decisions + fewer good decision = not fun.

If you play this with the right group of (ideally 6) capitalist oligarchs in a dystopic future, you are in for a ride.
Hilarious discussion, hidden traitor guessing, private agenda scheming, all the while with your desolate cyberpunk city on the edge of destruction.

Importantly this game is far from being as time consuming and corrosive to relationships as e.g. negotiation classic Diplomacy.

The theme is a thin veil over the abstractness of this title, the rule-set is quite easy to grasp and can almost be teached on the go. The rival system is fantastic although the traitor role is quite powerful. 
I felt this as a nephew to BSG (Battlestar Galactica), sacrificing theme and immersion in order to push for negotiation and personal greed.

Interesting game that has a couple of giant flaws in its design. I like the main puzzle of "
fixing" the city and everybody having its own agenda. The whole system of proposing actions and voting on them is great. If played well it could lead to some great negotiations. The one main thing that completely ruined my experience where the assets. These player powers can be all over the place and there are too much off them are seeded in the game. I think I would have rated this game higher if the assets where less frequent and swingy.

well i didnt expect much going into the game, and it more or less met my expectations.  a dump truck of negotiations and special powers for not a lot of any real strategy or tension.  probably there is some fun to be had when players start threatening to throw the game to the federalist if they handed some points.

Holy sh... this game can get intense. Even more than BSG I suppose (or maybe I have played BSG too many times by now).
It is a nice variant of the traitor and semi-coop style game and amazingly fast (even though games can last 2 to 3 hours). I have played it with 4 players only and there is basically no downtime, since you are constantly negotiating over EVERYTHING. Requires the right group of people I suppose because players who try to solve the "puzzle" laid out (meaning how to solve the various crisis on the board), will get burnt by the corrupt players who check their profit first, before committing to any "meaningful" support for the "greater good".
We had some of the funniest and hilarious discussions during this game (one of my favourite quotes from one of our players "It seemed a great idea at that time, from a short term point of view..." - The Federalist (me) won that game and I had to do nothing, since the others were so cutthroat, they totally forgot to save the city...

I guess this won't happen a second time (at least not the same way). Amazing game and one of my contenders for GOTY 2016.

Just finished reading the rules and I'm sooo stoked for this one, I have extremely high hopes for New Angeles and It has been my most anticipated game out of Gen Con. I'll be trying to get the right group to play it when it comes out I think that's what this game need to really shine! I'm hoping for a 10 rating guess well! 

Update: really REALLY love this game however one of our group wasn't to keen on it. It was a group of 4 and I bet with 5 it really shines. I enjoyed all the mechanics and the negations tactics. I dying to try it again with 5 players that are really into negotiation!

This is hit-or-miss, depending on the group. It's my first detailed miniature paint job, so it'll probably stay in my collection for a while. With the right group, this is a great back-stabby traitor game where you'll commonly have multiple winners. It's sure to hit the table a couple times a year.

Long negotiation game that relies too much on randomness/luck. On my secret objective, I was ahead of the player I was supposed to beat the entire game. But I ended up losing because he gained more points on his goal card in the last turn. For a game so long, it ends abrupt with surprise wins. Seemed very easy to figure out who the federalist was and which players were trying to beat who on their objective. Game felt stale and too long for what it is.

Well designed and very social, this game will scratch the itch for a semi-co-op, hidden traitor game with intense negotiation among the players.  It is very long, though, our first session with 6 players went four hours, with game explanation.  It does have a tremendous amount of tension, and suffers from AP problems because it is quite hard to decide what to do on your turn -- what to offer other players?  What to counteroffer?  How can you maximize your points (money) while making sure you don't lose to the Federalist?  Not for the novice gamer, New Angeles will remind you of Diplomacy at times, so beware of flaring tempers.  One of those games that isn't played every week, it certainly ranks highly with negotiation games that call for complete engagement of all the players.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I was honestly fairly impressed with this negotiation game. I think the sweet spot is likely 5-6 players although that will make the play go 3-4 hours most likely - at least when first learning the game. There is a fair bit of interesting wheeling and dealing occurring in this one although not everything is available to deal and future promises are not binding. I expect that quite a few learning games will be won by the Federalist as people won't really know how to balance game play with a traitor initially with everyone greedily trying to grab points where they can without regard to civil disturbances. Don't expect to purchase the game but I am happy to play with fun groups.

This is an epic game, a shining example of a semi-coop that works.  An emotional roller coaster for all who are ready to experience it.
The game requires a serious commitment of time (4+), is highly interactive, cutthroat, and has a significant amount of skullduggery.  It will make you want to flip the table, it will make you hoarse from haggling, you will stare at the board in disbelief and then you will open your eyes and understand that you are now in the world of New Angeles, where your best "friend" wants to eat you for lunch.  A smile will come to your face, and you'll go back to scheming and playing, delighted by the roller coaster.
I was engaged throughout the game and have many vivid memories.  The theme comes across very well, the mechanics are clear and interesting.  I can best compare it to BSG, Archipelago, and DoW, games with equally high investments/commitments of time and emotional/social resources.  They are not games to be played on a whim, but great experiences, almost cinematic.  New Angeles does not have an established IP that everyone can visualize (like BSG), a theme that is well known (like DoW), or the sandbox feel of Archipelago (where you build instead of just repairing).  The graphics are typical FFG -- I personally would have preferred a more minimalist, crisp, adult, modern look, but I can live with them.  I don't personally care much for the more cartoonish/miniatures look, but I am OK with it.  The quality of the components is good enough, with a nice big board, solid miniatures, and good quality (although too small) cards.  The rulebook is good.  Some cards could be clearer, and an FAQ and BGG's forums rules clarifications will be needed eventually.  Again, it could be better, but it's good enough.
The main game mechanics, the deal making, is truly excellent.  Repeated plays will test/show whether the game has longevity or whether some mechanics become repetitive after multiple plays, but if what I saw holds through repeated plays this is a classic that will stay in my collection for a long time to come.  It is an excellent negotiation, traitor (BSG style), semi-coop (Archipelago Style), diverging objectives (DoW style) game that ties all this with a knot, and results in many hours of face to face negotiation among ruthless players.  Looking forward to more plays.
If only someone would give it a facelift then it would be even more enjoyable...

(3/17) 8.  I LOVE games with player interaction and open negotiation, so I really, really enjoyed this game, even if I didn't play my first time it in optimal conditions...very little sleep after a long day out in the sun.  That said, I had a really fun time playing it.  Loved how stressful it was and the fluctuating alliances.  The length though, 4 hours, is going to make it a tough one to play regularly though I'm definitely looking forward to that next game, whenever it might be.

(10/17) Drop to 6.  Cooled on this a little just because of how long and sapping it is, though I would definitely, definitely be down to play it again as a sort of "main event" game.

Game too random and unbalanced both with assets, timing and event cards - especially given the length.  Too long for what it is.  My faction and Will's were underpowered.

Ich habe mich lange auf das deutsche Release von New Angeles gefreut, denn im Vorfeld wurde das Spiel als eine bessere Version von Battlestar Galactica gefeiert, welches mein absolutes Lieblingsspiel ist. Demnach war die Vorfreude groß und die Erwartungen nicht gerade klein. New Angeles spielt im Android (Netrunner) Universum. Die Spieler übernehmen die Rolle von Megakonzernen, deren Ziel es ist Einkommen zu generieren, aber auch die riesige Metropole New Angeles zu schützen und vor der Übernahme durch die Regierung zu bewahren. Herausforderungen gibt es viele: Krankheiten, Systemausfälle, Aufstände und das organisierte Verbrechen, machen es schwierig, die Kontrolle aufrecht zu erhalten. New Angeles ist ein semi-kooperatives Spiel, d.h. die Spieler müssen zusammen arbeiten, um die unzähligen Bedrohungen in New Angeles zu bekämpfen. Zeitgleich hat jeder Spieler aber auch ein geheimes Ziel und kann nur gewinnen, wenn er dieses erfüllt. In der Regel ist dies, mehr Einkommen zu generieren, als genau ein anderer Mitspieler. Den klassischen Verräter gibt es ebenfalls, in Form des regierungstreuen Agenten, der als Einziger gewinnt, wenn die Regierung die Kontrolle übernimmt. Der Kernmechanismus ist eine Bietphase, in der die Spieler unterschiedliche Aktionen anbieten und ihre Wahl den Mitspielern, als die Beste verkaufen wollen. Mit diesen Aktionen müssen Güter produziert werden, die die enorme Nachfrage in New Angeles stillen. Gleichzeitig müssen Krisen bewältigt werden. An vielen Punkten merkt man New Angeles an, dass Battlestar Galactica als Vorbildherhalten durfte. Zum Beispiel bei den Aktionskarten unterschiedlichen Typs und dass jeder Konzern unterschiedliche Arten zu Zugbeginn auf die Hand zieht. In der Verhandlungsphase wurde bei uns etwas stärker diskutiert als bei BSG, dafür ist nur selten die typische Paranoia am Spieltisch entstanden. New Angeles ist schlussendlich kein Ersatz für Battlestar Galactica. Der Aspekt der Verhandlungen, Bündnisse schließen und wieder brechen geht in eine andere Richtung und auch das Misstrauen ist gefühlt weniger groß. Mechanisch funktioniert New Angeles super und spielt sich etwas flotter als BSG. Das Material und Artwork ist wie immer super.

What an “in your face” game! 

During the game you get about 7 chances to propose an primary action along with more opportunities for proposing secondary actions in order to drive your income (VPs). All of these proposals can be countered AND rely on other players with different objectives to support them. So apart from bribery, coercion and influence to get the required support there is little else you can do strategically in this game to achieve victory. 

So this game comes down to your powers of persuasion and hoping that other players will be susceptible to your wiles. The whole game hinges on these discussions and subsequent votes and if things don’t go your way, there is very little you can do other than grin and bear it.

Some of the cards feel extremely powerful, e.g. the opportunity to steal income (VPs) on each of your turns.

With the right crowd though the game is a blast and providing you are happy to just enjoy the ride then it is a laugh a minute.

My main issue is the length of the game (2.5 - 3 hours for 5 players) which feels way too long for a game with minimal control of the outcome. Knowing this, I cannot see the game getting many future plays.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game for sure.  Just 1 play with 6 players so far.  I'm not sure what my true feelings about this game are.  On the one hand I like the theme, and trying to jockey for position.  On the other hand I felt rather powerless on how much I could actually sway/manipulate the game in my favor.  I really didn't feel like I made ANY meaningful decisions (I was Weyland).  The decisions I made were completely obvious.  

I was in a position where I couldn't really win any "Assets", because none of my "Offer" cards were clutch at the time I played them.  Assets are key in my opinion to be able to manipulate the game in your favor.  So I watched the game get played by 5 other players over 4 hours, and lost by 1 point.  Not sure what to make of that.

You don't see negotiation games come out all that often, and I think New Angeles is proof as to why. Negotiation games can be fun, but not when they go 2-3 hours. Not to mention New Angeles is incredibly dry despite being based in the Android universe and having pretty spectacular minis included. 

There have been a lot of comparisons to Battlestar Galactica, and I can definitely see why. There are different color-coded decks that make up your hand, and you represent your influence with them in supporting proposals made by other players. Where I prefer BSG, however, is with how it is a game where you play on a team. New Angeles is strictly everyone for themselves. In this way, it feels more akin to Dead of Winter. Everyone is kind of doing their own thing, but you want to keep the game from devolving into chaos. I also got a really similar vibe to the Homeland Board Game from GF9. If you like that one, there's a strong chance you'll like this one as well.

Lack of support and exposure has really hurt New Angeles, but it also feels like a game without an audience. I, for one, love the Android setting, but not when it is represented in such a dry and mechanical way like it is here and in Mainframe. I'm still holding out hope that we'll see something as wonderful as the original Android board game at some point, but until then, I think it's easy to pass on this one unless you're a big fan of negotiation.

RATING: 5.9
Non il mio genere di gioco. Apprezzo molto l'originalità e il tentativo di tirar fuori qualche cosa di diverso. La possibilità che ci siano diversi vincitori, oppure nessuno è sicuramente la scommessa più rischiosa, ma anche più originale del gioco. Da molti questa scelta viene criticata perché genera disequilibri e poca voglia di ribilanciare il gioco in caso di fazioni in fuga. L'alea nella pesca degli obiettivi è importante. Gli aspetti del gioco mi ricordano altri giochi come Risiko (per gli obiettivi segreti, e anche per il contenuto di alcuni obiettivi), Battlestar Galactica (per lo sviluppo del gioco e le varie fasi), Republic of Rome (per la finta cooperazione contro il gioco mentre in realtà ognuno sta curando i propri interessi) ecc.
Il gioco da il suo meglio in 6, ma al tempo stesso diventa un tantino lungo e ripetitivo. Il continuo tentativo da parte di tutti di convincere che si sta facendo il bene della città e bla bla bla, alla lunga risulta pesante e quasi fastidioso. Gioco da provare, ma che a mio avviso se durasse un po' meno avrebbe potuto essere l'anello di unione tra Avalon e Battlestar Galactica.

Los juegos largos de negociación son [b]precisamente [/b]los favoritos del paladar Ficus. Al menos de los que estuvimos en la partida.

Pero la primera experiencia con este fue mala. Muy mala.

Entiendo que no tenemos una partida completa con todas las reglas como corresponde, pero como testers, tampoco nos falta experiencia como para poder reconocer los méritos de cualquier prototipo que nos llega, aún a pesar de tener enormes escollos y huecos en las reglas. Hicimos cuatro partidas de Terraforming Mars y tres de Food Chain Magnate antes de terminar de entender todos los detalles y sutilezas, pero aún a pesar de las partidas rotas, podíamos reconocer que había algo genial en esos diseños.

Este no es el caso de New Angeles. Acá no va a surgir un diseño genial de las cenizas, más allá de las partidas que le pongas.

El escenario es una capa superficial y genérica de cromo, donde nada se distingue ni desarrolla su propia personalidad. El desafío es azaroso y antitemático. Las opciones son demasiado acotadas para una juego de negociación y como el juego no tiene una engine que vayas armando, la partida se desenvuelve de manera si no caótica, cuando menos arbitraria.

Este diseño condensa todo lo peor del trash. Complicación innecesaria, mecanismos bobos, guión lineal, arbitrariedad, sobreproducción, cromo, caos, frustración y en última instancia, la sensación de que después de todo el esfuerzo, no valió ni remotamente la pena.

Played it, enjoyed it. The semi-coop part is very well done. The negotiation part is strong and there's lots of interaction. But. 
The game didn't feel very balanced. Some of corps seem much better than others and the assets are very mixed in quality. And there's way too many of them. Once a player has 6 or more, it's really hard to keep track of what anyone can do.

RATING: 6
Mixed feelings about this. Simpler than many big-box FFG games, though!

The coolest but most disappointing feature is the negotiation mechanic, where players negotiate which one of two proposals are enacted (and which player gets some potentially powerful bonus).

During my first and only game, there wasn't much negotiation happening. It's probably because it was our first game and we didn't know the true value of anything. Some players also acquired some particularly strong assets, which enabled those players to render some negotiation rounds pointless. 

The board game play was truly disappointing. It was just a convoluted way of keeping track of resource gathering. Players don't control anything on the board, like your typical dudes-on-a-map game. But I suppose implementing that would make the game unbearably long, and I think the game is already too long.

Note that I'm not that all into FFG games. I don't care for cards with lots of text that amount to gaining or losing a particular resource. And I'm not that all impressed with sci-fi or fantasy themes either.

It's... a fine game.   The theme is nice, and the negotiation over the core proposal-counter proposal system is really, really cool.
However, NA feels under-designed and over-developed.   The rules aren't difficult to parse but are hopelessly inelegant and convoluted.  The plastic minis representing different AI forces are all the same color, making it annoying to read the board state at a glance...  And all of the special faction abilities, secret objectives, and specialist cards all have extreme balance issues.  
It feels like the designer needed to do a lot more play testing and design tweaking before this went to the press.  Which is a shame, because the core idea of having players jointly affecting the board-state as an oligarchy with wildly divergent goals is awesome.    I hope this eventually gets a second edition with reworked rules.

If you're looking for a game of this nature, I heartily recommend other titles such as Imperial, Tammany Hall, or Dogs of War.  They manage to distill the same tense negotiation and "friends today, enemies tomorrow" dialogue with more thoughtful, balanced, and elegant rules.

Co-op game with secret rivals and a possible traitor with negotiation at it's heart is a brilliant idea. Execution lacks something as the learning curve is a bit steep and some rules are counter-intuitive. Still very fun and very thematic, I have renewed hope for the Android IP.

Vicious negotiation game. Only played the 4-player version. One player had the bonus-support-for-free card and became the kingmaker. Another player switched Rivals late in the game with an event card and became the Federalists. Traipsed to victory with only one other player suspecting. Some factions seemed to jump out early with their ability to clear unrest and move androids… necessary in the early game by the rivals. Late game corporations like security, construction and anti-infection seemed at a disadvantage. While play is deep, play is very arbitrary. In retrospect after a game, the different player's choices are indecipherable and often seem quite counter to their own interests… only helping a Federalist.

It's been a long time since we've seen a good semi-cooperative thematic game that could hold its own on a shelf next to Battlestar Galactica. New Angeles has a tense voting and negotiation aspect where the secret goals ensure everyone is on your side...until it doesn't suit them anymore. I like that multiple players can win without that awful Cosmic Encounter style stalemate. Everything moved at a quick pace and every decision matters. Might not be the king of the genre, but I think it's close enough.

I enjoyed the intense political maneuvering and perverse incentives to create problems that you are uniquely suited to solve, thereby getting points for solving them.  And the nemesis mechanic worked well to create unlikely alliances.

However, the game was very long for what it was.  It could easily be 2/3 the length and may be only 1/3 and still deliver, with a few tweaks.

A bigger issue is gross imbalance in the nemesis mechanic.  If you are dealt someone else's faction, you need to exceed them, and that is great.  If you are dealt the traitor card, you need to make the team lose, and that is great,  If you are dealt your own card, you need to beat any 3 other players, which is vastly harder to do, and less interesting along the way.  For such a long game, having such a decisive bit of luck up front is unacceptable.  If you just redeal until nobody gets their own card, it is great.

as is: 3/10
with redeals to avoid drawing own card:  6/10
if you could somehow make it half the length:  8/10

Over all fun negotiation/hidden identity game. Could be hard to play as the Federalist.  Negotiation is fun at times but could also get tedious and lead to some heated discussions.  Game is a bit long and drawn out with all the offer/counteroffer/negotiations.

Clearly designed to be the BSG replacement after FFG gave up the license. New Angeles borrows a lot from BSG, but still manages to be unique. If you liked the former, you'll like the latter as well.

The game is fairly group dependent though - you're going to need players that will take advantage of the negotiation opportunities here, and who understand the difference between co-ops and semi-coops.

Really fun game with game groups willing to be a little selfish and a little vicious. Very clever part on the designer in creating situations promoting cooperation as well as antagonism! However, the game is rather long for what it is (hence the score). I thought it might be better if rebalanced to two demand rounds instead of three.

I'm not a big fan of semi-co-ops, but New Angeles addresses some of my problems. It retains some problems, not the least of which is the FF patented wildly imbalanced Asset cards. I still thought this was decent, and if you like semi-co-ops, definitely check this out. 

So in a genre I don't really like, it's one of the best. Which is why it's a 5.5.

RATING: 8
A quite pure negotiation game: there is practically no luck involved, and there are hardly any mechanics that don't incorporate (pun intended) into the negotiation.  Theme works well, and the artwork is good (though much is borrowed from the other Android games).  The genius of the game is how it is mostly cooperative (while trying to beat one other player secretly) and the debates are over choosing the best option between two good options.  It is long, so those who only like short games may have a hard time with it.

RATING: 5
This is a semi-cooperative game set in the Android: Netrunner universe.  In this game each player is a corporation with a secret nemesis.  A player needs to finish the game with more capital than their nemesis.  The secret nemesis can be one of the other player's corporations, themselves (meaning they need to have more capital than the bottom 2 or 3 players), are they can have a traitor-style role meaning they win if threat reaches the "everybody loses" level.

The gameplay itself is management of a chaotic board where illness, riots, outages, and crime is breaking out and each thing raises threat and if threat reaches 25 everyone loses (unless there is a "traitor").  You're trying to manage this to keep the game alive while also making as much capital as possible.  This is done with action cards.  Each round players offer up action cards form their hands and opponents can propose counter-offers with the remaining players supporting their  favorite action for the round by discarding their own cards.

The gameplay itself is kind of unique but honestly, semi-coop games just do not work 99% of the time.  ESPECIALLY with a traitor role.  When a game is already pushing players to a loss that they need to put effort into managing, if a player is also actively trying to encourage that loss it becomes trivially easy for them.  Without a traitor in the game and actively trying to keep threat from reaching that breaking point our first game of this was 2 short of everybody losing at the end.  Even without a traitor these types of games have the issue where a player who feels they have no chance of winning can just push the game to that point also so nobody wins.  Misery does love company.

Also no matter how well you play it feels less rewarding when there can be multiple winners.  You can kick ass and just "win also" with 3 or 4 other people who didn't do nearly as well as you.

RATING: N/A
So I've played it once thus far of a friend's copy. The problem was the terrible rule layout as usual and we completely botched the rules for the first demand.

I can't really decide if I want the game yet until another play through where we play the rules proper. Then I can give a better comment.

Initial impressions are the card drawing is slightly irritating and some of the other mechanics feels flimsy and unpolished. And a lot, and i really mean a lot of templating issues with the card text.

So the main issue is in the core mechanic of negotiation, which is pretty much the meat of the game. A lot of times, it doesn't matter to try to negotiate for something and using credits to get deals. We are mostly just playing actions to try to deal with the crazy nonsense that's happening to the city.

With regards to the cards, i would rather each corp just have a deck of cards with their unique cards and some general cards that they just draw from. In that regard, I would like more variety in the cards. I would need like 7 copies of cards to remove unrest when there isn't even any unrest to quell.

A lot of the assets, if they come out at the wrong times, are pretty useless, which is the case for the assets near the end of the game.

But a lot of these issues could be due to us getting the rules wrong, so I'll reserve my opinion until i get a proper second game.

But the assets and the card draw really gets to me at the moment. I've been considering this to Sidereal Confluence as an negotiation-heavy euro-ish game. Leaning towards Sidereal but still undecided due to my insane need to redo the entire UI and art for Sidereal if i do get it.

RATING: 9
Really fun negotiation game. Each side has it's speciality and you have to work together to some extent to win. It's best to just make sure you take a slightly larger slice of the pie than everyone else while 'cooperating'.
Playing with the federalist is a MUST to prevent intentional tanking of the game, but they knew that which is why it's there.. 
A great game with hints of 'Republic of Rome' but only 10% of the rules overhead.
Always generates a lot of noise and atmosphere whenever it hits the table.

As my mate likes to say, it's a one trick pony.. but it's a great trick.. so nobody minds.

I only played as the traitor, and I lamented the lack of control -- the feeling of being backed into a corner while everyone else enjoyed a rich panoply of options. I admire the design, to be sure. It's clever in so many ways, but the game is also long and socially exhausting. If you want to do anything, you have to convince the others to go along with you. That is both the game's strength and its weakness. My problem is very much a stylistic preference. I can admire the game without loving it -- and that's where I'm at.

I haven't played Archipelago or Battlestar Galactica, to which this game is often compared, so I can't comment on the similarities or differences.

First play impression: This is good. Maybe even really good. And I'm someone who doesn't usually like negotiation games. Instead of just passing money back and forth based on perceived values, here you can all usually see what needs to be done in order to meet the demand for the round. So you try to convince, extort, and blackmail other players into helping toward that goal. What makes it more interesting, though, is that each player has their own investment card that gives them more money for bad stuff being on the board, and there is likely a traitor who wants to sink the whole game.

So really you've got a fairly simple skeleton of a game here with added layers of distrust and selfish goals.

One notable thing is the action system. You don't just take an action like in most games. Instead, you propose an action using the cards you've drawn and then other players give support to the action of their choice. The actions usually have both a positive and negative effect that players have to consider. Each player draws different types of cards based on which corporation they control, so you feel like you're really taking on your role. One corporation, for example, is the security expert. When criminals and anarchists start taking over the city, they need to step up and take care of it. The media corporation needs to get involved when too much unrest takes hold in the city, or else the public will go on strike and stop producing resources.

Another notable thing is that even though the game goes for about four hours, you're involved the whole time. I played a five player game and there was never a moment where someone just sat and watched. Everyone was constantly making the case for why their action should go through and convincing others to give support, of course all while trying to fulfill their own secret investments.

I will say that the Federalist (the traitor-like role) won pretty easily in the end. I imagine that this is because of our inexperience with the game, though, so we'll have to play accordingly in future games.

Overall just an excellent game, one of my favorites of 2016 so far.

I'm not totally sure what to think about this game.  I didn't mind the semi-odd win conditions, but I also think they led to somewhat odd in game decision making.

It seems like one of those games that you really need to play several times with experienced players to have a good idea of what to do and be able to actually "play" the game, instead of just doing things hap-hazardly.

I think playing well and playing intelligently would require a really deep understanding of the system and I am not likely to commit that kind of time to the game.

Some interesting ideas but I don't think it is the kind of game I would be willing to commit to and that seems like what this game would require.

New Angeles is a negotiation game where the goal is to do better than some other random player. At the beginning of the game you randomly get assigned another player and must outperform them to win. You don't have to be the best, just better than your secret grudge. Alternatively, you might be the traitor and only win if you can tank the game.

The game last six rounds. Every two rounds you'll be judged on some group goals, and receive corruption (I think that's what it was called) if you fail to meet those goals. Additionally, you'll have personal goals which score you points. If the corruption ever gets too high, the game ends and the traitor (if there is one) wins. If you make it to the end of the 6th round, then everyone who outperformed their secret grudge wins.

Each round the start player plays a card from his hand to the project space. If no one counters that project with their own, then it's accepted automatically. If someone wants to propose a counter project they must discard a card to play a counter proposal. Other people can play additional counter projects (knocking out the last counter project) but each subsequent project requires discarding additional cards, making it progressively more and more expensive. If there's more than one project on the table, then it goes to a a vote to see which one is accepted. Players spend cards to vote for one project over the other (although you can abstain). If there's a tie, then the primary project beats the counter proposal. (Cards can be tight in this game.)

Whichever player had the winning project gets a special bonus card that gives them some special ability (each round there's a different one) and gets to execute the actions on their project card... deciding how they're resolved. Generally players want to meet the public goals (assuming they're not the traitor) but they also have personal goals they might want to emphasize. And of course they don't want their secret grudge to do well.

During the proposal and voting phase players are encouraged to negotiate and make deals. That's really the heart of the game. The fact that players have different personal goals, want to hurt one specific other player and/or might be the traitor means that you never quite know who you can trust, and you have to dance a delicate balance of trust and deceit.

There were interesting things in this game, and I kind of liked the idea of the game. The actual play of the game wasn't ideal for me though. First off, it's much too long for what it does. If you could play the game in half the time it'd be something I'd be much more interested in.

Second, there's a bit too much luck for such a long game. In our game, two players were in the lead at the end of the game, myself and another player. She had a slight lead on me, but it quickly became apparent that I was her secret grudge as she wouldn't ever do anything that would give me points or help me, despite it otherwise making sense. Which was just bad luck for her. If she had been assigned any other player she'd have had an easy win, as we were a bit ahead of the pack, but she ended up in a bad spot through no fault of her own. (She was later able to switch roles and get a different secret grudge, so it worked out). Also, in the final round, I had to choose between two personal goals which both conflicted with the public goal. There was essentially no chance of me getting more than 2 points out of either goal... whereas there were other goals that gave people opportunities for 7 or so points which didn't conflict with the public goals. That was a huge random slap in the face (I still scored higher than my grudge, so it didn't make a difference...)

Third, like many negotiation games and semi-coop games, other players can screw the game. In our game, a player was upset that he wasn't winning... so he took a shady deal from the traitor that allowed the traitor to tank the game and win. (He admitted this was the semi co-op "If I can't win then why should you" mentality.) In point of fact, the guy who made the bad deal was actually pretty far ahead of his secret grudge and cost himself (and several others) a win. So even though several players played well and should have won, a random player at the table skewed everything. It was an unsatisfying ending to a game I'd invested 4+ hours in.

I have only played once but the game moves along at a great pace, backstabbing, allying, counter-offering, more backstabbing, more alliances, trading, conniving, backstabbing again, and good fun all the way around.

I like the quick pace of the deals and the variable nature of the length of the rounds. The Federalist player adds a cooperative element while still maintaining strong competitive play.

Deal making is paramount but built into the game so it doesn't drag. You must make deals quickly and move along. The bidding process is nuanced as the player to act last has a distinct advantage in extorting, I mean bargaining, for votes.

The various influence cards add to the game as well without being overly powerful. I'd play this again most certainly.

First game with six experienced players (with one player knowing the rules beforehand) took seven hours, and the game ended via Threat in round 5 (i.e. it would've gone even longer if we played better). That time didn't feel that long, though. The game is not complicated, just time consuming. It also probably takes at least one game to get an idea on how to play it with a good strategy. We liked it overall. Interesting theme that the mechanics support. It does feel like doing corporate 	scheming. Good manual and excellent components (with the exception of tiny cards).

Secret objectives, ulterior motives, wicked machinations, this game hits my sweet spot so hard.  It is long, but it doesn't feel like it.  The first "round" may feel a little long as you're slowly building up your infrastructure, but there's a very neat arc as rivalries start to expose themselves and the more powerful assets find their way to the table.  Unspoken alliances form, vendettas are created, collectively you try to save the city while hating each other all the way... and then the traitor makes his plans obvious and suddenly everyone is best friends as they band together.  Fascinating game, I love it!

Only one play and it is quite good with the right group. I tried to suggest the "we all start as friends and leave the table as friends" but my group sarcastically said, "I don't care about that." I correctly identified the federalist (well, I knew there was one and knew it was one of two people) and was able to cue the others in on that information. Interestingly we all would have one ... but lost on the very last turn of the game. I think one player, who happened to have the most captial was being overly greedy and we ended up not being able to deal with sickness very well.

I was pretty enamoured with the idea of this game when I first heard about it... and it didn't let me down when I got to play.  The basic mechanics feel like any number of Euro Co-ops where you collect certain sets of things to stop bad things from happening.  But everybody having their own monetary goal to achieve led to lots of potentially non-helpful wheeling and dealing that got really interesting at times.  Unfortunately a lot of our games devolved into full co-op mode leaving whoever drew the "traitor" card in a pretty impossible position with little to no player agency.  This left a bad taste in my mouth despite liking so much of the rest of the game so I ended up trading it away.  I hope my copy found a home with the right group to get the full enjoyment out of it since the concept of New Angeles is pretty great.

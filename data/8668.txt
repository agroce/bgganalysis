Pretty good for what it is, which is a light amusing filler.  

I don't like that the rules tell you to score your own thalers at the end of the game.  We play without doing that.  Great game.

A fun listening, spread-betting/betting game that can be quite chaotic and silly.  Best played with as many players as you can get (up to 6) and with children in the mix, but it can also work as a game to play after a few glasses of wine.

If you play with children though, watch they don't cheat or accidentally reveal the numbers to other players.

RATING: 6
The kids (girls 9 and 7) like to play this once in awhile.  Naturally, it was more popular when we first bought it.  I find it's a good game to play when the kids have friends over.

The components are more than adequate and the game plays pretty quickly.

Meh.  It seems that our skill deteriorated over the length of the game, instead of getting better!  Not really my thing, but it may be fun to play with kids.

RATING: 9
Within the 2 days after I've just got this game, our family played it over 10 times!  While this is undobtedly a "light" game, it is very fun!  The concept has been used in Zapp Zerapp, but here the boring "Ludo" part has been removed, and the game is rightly focused on the best part, the "rattles".  The three different kinds of cards, with different difficulty levels and different score values, creates lots of fun and laughters: especially during the "showdowns" when there are more than one igloos placed on a 3-point card (with only one number)!  The rules are cleverly optimized: the risk that you'll lose a point if your bet is wrong rewards careful accuracy over reckless speed; the rule that you can win your opponent's wrong bets increases the excitement and tension of the "showdowns" (and justifies the risk in "challenging" an opponent's bet); even the rule that the higher-numbered igloo wins the card (where there are more than one correct bets on a card) is right, because it is harder to correctly identify a higher-numbered igloo than a lower-numbered one!  The "miss by one" bets are hilarious, the "miss by a lot" bets are hilarious, and those miraculous correct 3-point bets are hilarious (especially when a player makes several of them in a round)!  The respectable 20+ scores are hilarious, and the insulting 5- scores are hilarious too!  There are so many funny moments in this game.

A children's game that is loved by all the adults I've introduced it too. Too much fun!

With 20 plays it almost became the most played game of 2004, even though it was only bought in December!

In 2005, though, it has been usurped by a classic children's game, Mousie Mousie, which is the new leader in the "Fast, Furious, Fun" category.

On the plus side: it's a great re-working of Zapp Zerapp.  It's preserves the unique mechanism of that game, but replaces the old Parchesi/Sorry/Trouble race aspect with a new, neat scoring system... which also makes the game play faster.  However, the new, cool gameplay is kind of undone by the physical production: the igloos can be hard to grab (they're slippery plastic domes), and removing a player's token from an igloo often made me wish I had a pair of needlenose plyers!  Still... fast, silly, fun.  I think the Igloo Pop "game" is better, but Zapp Zerapp is more pleasing to play.

Simple game play which ensures a fast game. Very enjoyable as a family game, especially with the young ones. Pace is fast and exciting enough to keep adults from becoming bored.

This is the fast playing version of Zapp Zerapp - a good starter or inbetweenie for a gamers night!

RATING: 7
Rating is for adults.  Would rate this an 8 for kids under 10.  Fast paced fun as you scramble for the igloos.  A good way to spend 15-20 minutes.  It's a great leveling field for adults playing with children and is enjoyable for adults.  Plays well with 2-4, but gets more frentic with more players as you're grabbing for the igloos.

it's not really possible to gauge the number of balls in the igloos.  It's mostly a racing guessing game.  Extraordinarily chaotic.

I bought this game thinking my youngest would like it.  We played 2 games in a row and he won by a huge margin (wife played too, we both TRIED to identify the beads).  After such an easy win I thought he would like the game but every time since then that I suggest it he would rather play something else.
(edit:  Come to find out the reason he did so well is he was cheating.  I chastised him for his cheating and complimented him on his stealth)

This game is fun, and not just for kids.  There's definite bragging rights here to who is better and shaking and blindly identifying unseen amouns of glass beads.  It's short and can be used as a filler.  Pulling my rating down a little is simply the fact that it's a fast and NOISY game, and you probably won't want to play more than 1 or 2 games at a time.

This was given to me almost as a joke, and to be honest the description on the back of the box is more fun to read than the game inside is to play. But maybe I'm just bitter because I am so horrendously awful at the game and can see no possible way to improve myself. Fun for kids, at least.

If your game night is bogging down and people are getting tired, bring this out. A circle of adults shaking little plastic igloos by their ears, with intense expressions on their faces, will loosen up the most Squidward-like player. It's hard not to laugh, and hard not to just really WANT TO GUESS when you pick up one of those bead-filled igloos. Thought exercise: how on earth did the designer come up with this game concept? I'm just glad he did!

Rated 7 after one play with a smart kid and some adults. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The young daughter of some good friends of mine quickly picked up the rules, and we got busy shaking igloos to guess how many beads were in each. 

Very enjoyable, and it fulfilled the exact niche I was hoping for--an easy to teach, easy to play game that kids can learn and adults can tolerate!

Update: as a kid's game, this one is on the bubble. With nieces and nephews ranging from 5 to 7, this one is falling a bit flat. Not sure why, but kids want to keep playing their favorites, and this one isn't in that grouping.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This cute game is good for some laughs or party mayhem.  The lower numbers are quite a bit easier to gauge than the higher ones; telling the difference between 12 and 13 plastic bits by rattling is pretty tricky.  I worry about the durability of the pieces, though.

RATING: 4
Given that this is likely to be played with non-gamers, the explanation takes longer than it should. That said, it is quite a bit of fun shaking those little igloos and stealing discs from your opponents. And there is certainly something super satisfying about hitting the 3-pointers on the nose. I'll hang onto this one and see if the kids ever get into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fairly fun Zoch game that can be approached by younger kids.  Basically you just guess how many beads are in the igloos, but there are some tactical decisions in gaining points.  For younger kids, the simultaneous draw mechanic might be scrapped for a traditional turn based system.  This makes it a little more approachable.  Still, a fun game - but perhaps not as engaging as some of Zoch's other offerings.

Not my favorite of the Zoch games. I guess I don't enjoy the time pressure of having to snatch the igloos and make bets while other players are trying to do the same. I think there may be a turn-taking variant that would work well as a two player game with a small child.

This may be for children, but it's pretty fun with adults as a quick filler.  I don't have any other games based on sound.  There is a bit of a feel/touch element too, as you can feel slight weight differences.  Fun.

RATING: 5
There are strategy games, party games, dexterity games, and... what is this? Well, the primary (and really only) mechanic is picking up little plastic igloos with baby eskimos (glass beads) inside and trying to guess how many there are. But you need to be fast, because from the pool of igloos, the faster you evaluate, the more chances you have, because it's a free for all until all igloos have been claimed. Great game for kids or complete non-gamers who want to learn something in 2 minutes, and play in 15. Not a lot of legs for gamers, though.

Gave to kids Christmas 2007.  Has some fun, but doesn't last very long.  I wish there where better ways to hide the values on the bottom of the igloos so you don't have to keep reminding the kids not to look at them.  There usually always one in a group of kids that peeks.

This is a pure luck game.  I don't know how you can make a logical guess in this game.

If you've played Zapp Zerrapp, you can think of this as Zapp Zerrapp without all of the boring parts, and with slightly (only slightly) more interesting strategies.  Mainly, the shaking and listening is a lot of fun--if that part appeals to you, you should enjoy this game.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun kids game of guesstimation.  The pieces are neat but you'd be well advised to let whichever kid(s) you're playing with play around with the igloos a bit first to get some idea of what each number sounds and feels like otherwise you'll end up with said child(ren) making massively inaccurate guesses and getting a bit frustrated with the whole exercise.

RATED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PLAYING WITH MY CHILD.

Very light 15 minute game, good for up to 6 players.  Shake plastic igloos to guess (by sound and weight) how many glass beads are inside.  A good filler to pull out from time to time for a barrel of laughs and silliness - just not too often or too long.  Also very suitable for children.  Recommended in carefully selected small doses with the right people, for a light and fun time.

This game is ridiculous, from start to finish. But that's not a bad thing. It's actually really enjoyable - therapeutic, even. It goes fast; even with people who are prone to over-analysis, there's not much thinking involved in shaking an igloo around and guessing how many fish sticks are inside.

I picked it up for fun, just for the unique mechanism. It's fast and silly and is at least a curiosity – the perfect filler. But it shines in a mixed kids-and-adults environment. Like Chicken Cha Cha Cha, adults can play all-out and still lose to an uncannily adept child. Adults can think a bit more tactically about their "wagering", though this doesn't seem to help against the kids as much as it should. (Cut to my five-year-old shaking an igloo for about two seconds before quickly and confidently inserting his thaler and placing it on a card, moving on to another igloo, then another... and being correct each time!)

Using one of the more unique game mechanics out there (guessing how many beads are in each enclosed igloo), this game has more strategy and think involved than a glance at the back of the box might indicate.  Great for kids, and not bad for adults who need a break from their brain-burners either.

Kid's game?!?!  KID'S game?!?!  I think not!  It's fairly challenging for adults!  Sure the CONCEPT is simple: Shake an igloo, try to guess how many little pebbles are rattling around in there.  We laughed a LOT -- the expression on people's faces as they are listening to the rattle is PRICELESS.  I usually don't like frantic, simultaneous play; I'm more of a take-your-turn kinda guy, but in this case I enjoy it.  Hope to play this one a lot...

It's not a game to play all the time, but it is a great filler, especially at a party.  I tend to shy away from noise, but I can't help but love this one.

[b]Accessibility Note:[/b]  The rules can be easily modified to take turns and allow players with sight or coordination difficulties to join in.  If needed, a short timer (15- or 30-seconds) may be added to keep things exciting and moving along.

I played this with a 90-year-old blind woman and another senior woman with poor fine motor control.  We all took turns (no timer) and had a blast!

I played it and I wasn't even drunk...  an odd little childrens game that is probably too complex for little kids, as far as scoring goes.  a good party game i imagine.  easily turn it into a drinking game, if that is your thing.  not likely to appear as an online game version.

This is a game about trust. Trust that the guy who put it together can count. Trust that people won't peek at the bottom of the igloo. Trust that you are not serious about winning.

It is a lot of fun as a family/kids game. Would be OK filler for laughs with gamers.

Ok party game for the right moment, I would prefer others, but never refuse a game if it is on the table. The Igloo sounds, make your bet :)

RATING: 6
Frantically shake a pile of rattles and bet on how many little plastic beads are contained in them. That's the entire game. The same rattle-guessing system was used previously in the game Zapp Zerapp, which adds a Parcheesi-like board game to the system. I think the simple wagering of Igloo Pop makes a better game for most adults. Zapp Zerapp is probably the better choice for young children, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a novelty game, built on a gimick. Can you figure out the number of beads in a rattle?

That being said, it's a really cool gimick and one that really works.

Igloo Pop is nothing more than a one trick pony but it's a trick that's worth the price of admission.

Fun family game, very novel too. This is the first game I have played in which hearing is paramount. The game itself is very simple and quick paced. The rules can be taught under 2 minutes but it is fun. We all laughed when we played it. 

The game is way too simple to catch my attention for long, so I wouldn’t want to play it too often (from time to time it is ok). As a kid, I think I would have loved it.

Bottom line, a unique fun family game to play from time to  time. Perhaps I will buy it in the future.

A cute, fast game where players are trying to best feel out how many beads are in their igloo.  With the smaller numbers, this is fairly simple, but move into 8, 9 and higher, there's a lot less certainty as to what igloo you hold in hand.  This one's a good bit of fun and doesn't overstay its welcome.

I wouldn't want to play this all the time, but it's certainly unique and can hit the spot when you're in the mood for something light and silly.  It can be quite challenging, especially when everyone's grabbing for the igloos at the same time.  I can see how this could potentially take a little too long - 15 to 20 minutes seems just about right.

RATING: 6.5
A light filler game designed around a noise/shaking mechanic. Players gamble by placing bets on how many beads they think are in an igloo. While the game itself is fun, the scoring and gambling rules are a little too convoluted for such a light game. A simpler scoring method would've been much preferred.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Shake plastic containers, then bet on how many small beads are in them. Apparently this takes Zapp Zerapp, drops the Pachisi-like board element powered by the shaking and just gives out some points instead. Whether or not this is an improvement, and no matter how quick the game is, speed shaking as a main mechanism gets old just about as quickly. Regrettably the wooden discs are likely to be worn after vigorous play, as they fit very snugly into the hard plastic igloos. By the way, the German flavour text makes slightly more sense than the embarrassing English one.

Thrifted two copies on 8/8 2015.

Its something fun to pull out for a quick filler every once in a while which is quite different than anything else.  Everyone has 3 chances to grab an igloo, shake it to try and determine how many beads are inside, and place it on one of the 9 cards which you think most likely quantify how many beads are in the igloo.  The more exact you are, the higher you can score.

One of my favorite kid games.  Try to guess the number of beeds.  We play where its not a race, you just pick up one per round.  There is some luck, whoever gets the 2 is going to guess easier than the 10 and if you pick up the 2 with no 2 card, then you are screwed.  However, that is fine, it is a kids game and it plays in 15 minutes.  I could see adults playing as well.

I loved Zapp Zerapp from the get-go, and this is like the more portable, "card game" version of that SdJ-nominated groundbreaker. Actually, it's more than that, because Igloo Pop is not only more portable, it's more versatile (wider range of players), easier to play & teach, and ends up coming to the table ten times more than its big brother. A great development of an already great idea.

A fun family/kids game where you need to quickly pick up an igloo, shake it, listen to the amount of beads inside of it, determine the number, and finally place the igloo on a point card with your marker in it.  If the number you think is in there is not available, you place it back in the village for someone else to try.

This is a very quick silly game.  It is amazing how many people will guess a 4 bead igloo is 13, or vice versa, silly fun for children/family.

A really fun children's game that as an adult I never mind playing. We just don't play this one enough and we always enjoy ourselves every time we do play. It supports a lot of players and I think it really is best with a full complement...at least it certainly is more chaotic and funny that way. 

The whole game is making guesses as to how many beads are in the igloos. You give them a shake and when you feel ready to make a guess, you place your colored player disc in the igloo to mark your guess. Lots of fun!

Technically, my daughter's, but she doesn't have a profile here, sooo.

Very simple, but fun game that is particularly good to play with children.  Seal beads inside igloos, put stickers on the bottom (no peaking!), then deal out cards that have numbers on them.  The first number or set of numbers lists the number of beads you think is in the igloos, which you can shake and then put on the card.  The second is the number of VP you get if you're right by claiming the card.

Fast, simple, fun, and good with kids.

Good game to play with children and not to get bored in the process. I had a hard time, but, closing the igloos (they are very hard to pull).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
OK, this is hilarious. The game consists of a bunch of small plastic igloos which each contain between 2 and 13 glass beads. You grab an igloo and shake it next to your ear to estimate how many beads it contains. Everyone's grabbing and shaking simultaneously and then placing bets on the numbers. Maybe it's a kids' game, but this big kid had a blast.

RATING: 6
The mechanic is just as fun here as in Zapp Zerapp, but it also gets just as repetitive as in that game as well.  Decent game, not one that I want to play frequently.

(Note: I rate children's games as what I'd play with someone from the appropriate age group. So, for instance, an 8 would mean that if my toddler wants to play a game, I might suggest this and wouldn't try to talk him out of it if that's what he had in hand.)

I'm not even sure how I would classify this game. Its one saving grace is that it's unlike anything I've played before. Still doesn't mean it's good.

RATING: 6.7
Players: 2-6
Time: 20 min.

Family game in which players try to guess how many "eskimos" are in an igloo by shaking it and listening to the beads inside. Incorrect guesses will cost players future opportunties to guess, and more precise guesses (e.g. 8 over 7,8,or9) are rewarded more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
This is a kids game that also can be entertaining for adults despite the theme being ridiculous.  Kind of funny though.  Very unique idea and fun.  Not a dexterity game from a transitional standpoint per se but shaking the igloos and guess the amount of beads in them is actually quite entertaining surprisingly enough.  there is luck involved but determining how aggressive you are with the igloos can pay out big or really hurt you so there is some light strategy involved.  Great kids game that I would put up there with Gulo Gulo however, not similar at all.

RATING: 5
listening as a core mechanic!  The concept and construction are both great.  The game rules are a bit weak -- it is too hard to get the high numbered goal cards, and there is no consolation prize for being close, so the game tends to lock.

With a small modification, the game can really shine -- if nobody is correct, the lowest overbid wins the card.  That way, low igloos allow for accuracy but high igloos allow you to snag hard cards.  However, being accurate is still always the best.

Also, make Thalers not worth points at the end of the game.  Then players take more risks, and you avoid anticlimactic victories by players who literally do nothing.

RATING: 4
Weird very light filler game. It combines real-time grabbing (which I don't like) and careful listening to distinguish sound subtleties (which I don't like) as you must shake sealed opaque plastic igloos with various numbers of balls inside and try to guess how many balls are in an igloo. Groan. At least it doesn't take long to play and so is tolerable as a quick filler.

--Jun2006-- Very silly guessing game based on sound of beads in little plastic igloos.  A bit difficult for the children, in that they're a bit more tempted to "cheat" (and peek at the label on the bottom of the igloos) than would be desirable.

RATING: 6
A silly-looking children’s game with deceptively refined gameplay. Players bet on their hearing skills by jangling little plastic containers and estimating how many beads are in them. Things get tricky because a few wager cards offer more points in exchange for exact guesses, and not all values may be present in a round to wager on.

Once in motion, the game is quick, unique and chaotic. I particularly love the tension as igloos are overturned to reveal their values. One downside is that the average player would (rightfully) reason that a better score can sometimes be achieved by not wagering at all. However, this can be rectified using a house rule to halve the score from your own discs. I guess another downside is that consecutive games will lead inevitably to a temporary case of tinnitus – but that [i]might[/i] just be me.

Great fun for a few plays and for nongamers.

Players frantically shake igloos (there are 2-12 little plastic balls inside) and try to place their tokens on cards with matching numbers. 

If the number matches, the person gets the card and token back.

Game ends when someone runs out of tokens and VPs are scored for number of tokens plus VPs on cards.

Silly fun and great to watch but ultimately a little dull once you 'get' the hang and feel of the igloos.

RATING: 6
With kids, it is, as they say, a hoot. A unique mechanic of listening to the number of tiny plastic balls in another bit of plastic is quite interesting the first few times. My six-year old is now addicted so I'll have plenty more chances to see how long that interest remains. Learning estimation is a good skill, too, so I like it for that reason as well.

[RGG 2003 edition] {Party; action, hearing, betting; optimal 4-6p} Igloo Pop is an interesting and visual appealing gateway game. It is very suitable for family, kids and a party and welcome by all of my friends.

It's funny to watch a game of Igloo Pop.  It is funny to see players grabbing and shaking the Igloos with a hectic pace.  It's very enjoyable to have a correct guess, esp. on the single igloo card while other players got it wrong. Players may yell if they miss the card just by 1 bead.

The Igloos are cute but you have to assemble them. The theme is silly and artificial.

07 JUL 2009 - More challenging than it looks...you think you're got it figured out and then you are totally wrong in guessing how many beads are inside each igloo.

Another game for some family fun that isn't boring for adults and everyone has an equal chance at winning. Heck, adults will probably like playing this even without the kids.

Honestly, one of the most fun games I've played. Light, accessible, and funny.

NOTE: After 15 plays the game is still OK, but it is losing some luster. With new players the fun comes back a bit, but each game feels pretty much the same. Not much drama. Still, very fun as a new experience.

Played several times with my 7- and nearly 6-year old. Really fun game that works with both kids and adults. The components are very nice and the rules are very clear.

RATING: 6
The description of the game sounds more fun than it is. At least to me. Which is not to say it isn't fun, just less fun than I think it should be.

This might be the only game I know of that could be genuinely competitive with 5-year-olds and adults.

I suppose a group could play this so much that they make consistently accurate guesses. Would that make the game more fun or less fun?  I submit that this hypothetical group of people would themselves be so u -fun as to make the question moot.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 2

RATING: 6.5
Fast and fun. Great light filler. Sometimes embarasing when you really blow a guess by 4 or more beads, like I do all the time. Much more fun if you envision the giant shaking all the children out and then eating them, then I think it becomes a wargame, tecnically.

RATING: 7
After the rules to this game were explained to me, my first reaction was: "That's it? So who goes first?" That's when I learned the most important rule of all: Everyone participates simultaneously! That's the key that makes this a fast, frenetic, and fun filler. Just look at all those F's used to describe a fabulous and fantastic non-Friese game. For those not familiar with Igloo Pop, the basic premise is that players are confronted with a bunch of identical-looking plastic igloos, which you shake and then guess how many beads are inside (or fishsticks or Eskimo children depending who you ask; speaking of which, this game has possibly the best descriptive paragraph on the back of the box ever). The game works because everyone is simultaneously grabbing and shaking these igloos so it's a chaotic and loud scrum. With the right group, this one is a perfect 15-minute blast. Another winner from Zoch!

Funny game about hearing and betting. Shake, shake, and bet. Oh's come after revealing an incorrect bet. Wow's come after you win an exact bet. It is a game which you enjoy it really much even if you lose the game by far. And it's a game which you may have a end game score lower than your starting score. ROFL. I love it.
Skillful hearing helps you make easier bets. Wise betting helps you to win it.

Fun guessing game with cool components. It was really hard to guess right and most of us end up just loosing points in the game (as you lose points each time you guess wrong).

This is very close to an 8 rating, I just find that it's too silly and frantic to be played all the time. Also, I'm not super great at it (but I do have a strategy). I enjoy it as a quick, fun game but what I love most is the fact that it's a high energy game that relies on speed but that also has a fair bit of thinking involved. It's a good mix, I feel as though it combines many elements well into a very simple and short game. Plus, I just like the premise of shaking and listening- I think it's original and cute. :)

This is a game unlike any other in my collection - and it is a fun distraction to play from time to time.  Players need to shake little plastic igloos full of glass beads and guess how many beads are inside.  It is frantic, fast, loud (shaking igloos) and lots of fun.  The biggest challenge playing this game with children is the temptation to cheat by looking at the bottom of the igloos.

I can see how this has the potential to be a hilarious party game for all adults, particularly after having heard the back story for the game, however I don't see it as one I'd turn to often for that purpose.  It was fun for what it was.  I think my 8 yr old would be frustrated with it and my 11 yr old wouldn't think it had enough "cool quotient" for her to play.

I'd like to play this sometime with a less overbearing, and more honest child.  This is certainly an unusual gaming experience, as you try to discern how many beads are in the igloos you pick up.

This game is great! For relaxing the brain after an intense game of E&T or El Grande, there's nothing like it...It's good to have a game that does NOT require thinking for a change!!

Simple funnish game - and tough! I never get my guesses right which probably means I need to practice more...

A very original and cute game. Kids should love it and adults will enjoy it as a light and speedy distraction or as an activity to enjoy with beer.

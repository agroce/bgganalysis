GAME: Warhammer Underworlds: Shadespire
RANK: 752

RATING: 10
Let's get it out of the way, this game has dice, which means, sometimes, things just won't go your way, or, you're blessed by the dice gods and can do no wrong.  There.  More importantly, every aspect of this game is a tactical decision.  You choose your warband, you build your decks, you even choose your board and potentially the setup of the entire game board.  This is a game about making every decision count.

Gameplay is quick and tight.  Effect resolutions, card and player, are clearly laid out.  Phases are clear and concise.  As your deck function does not entirely rely on a resource (mana etc.) you should always have options.
 
For variety, the deck building offer customization that will only get better the deeper the card pool gets and the more warbands that become available.  More importantly, right out of the box, these two warbands have very distinct characters.  They pursue their own paths to victory.

I will say, if this were a standalone game, I'd probably give it an 8.  But it's laid the foundation to be an exceptional competitive game that will, as I said above, only get better with each expansion.  A deeper cards pool and a greater variety of warbands will make tournaments and one of games always fresh and and exciting.  I gave it a 10 with knowledge that GW plans on pushing and supporting the game, but also the hope that it does well enough for them to keep pushing it's development so it can reach it's potential. 
    
-Production Quality-
Models: It's Games Workshop, the models are stunning.
Cards: Card quality is comparable to any other CCG, but if you're looking for Magic, or any LCG quality artwork, not so much.  The cards are visually functional, with rules clearly printed and decent graphic design.
Boards: Beautiful artwork, quality stock, well made.
Tokens: Nice matte texture, durable.
Dice: Etched, nice weight, solid.
Rulebook:  Well laid out, concise and clear rules writing.  Quick start sheet also nicely executed.

RATING: 8
Pros:
Great miniatures. Quick set up and play time. Fairly simple rules. Lots of tactical options. Fun!

Cons:
Could do with more battle boards for variety. I'd prefer the old Warhammer universe over the Age of Sigmar setting. Minor issue, but something about being able to create your own custom deck using cards from the base game and expansions doesn't feel right to me. Almost makes it a collectible card game. Sadly no elf warband.

A fast paced, strategic, skirmish style game.  Excellent for quick battles and can get several games into one session.  Fantastic miniatures and board art.  Components are of very good quality and the game mechanics are easy to learn. The deck building aspect is fairly straight forward and has lots of potential for tweaking as more expansions come out.  Highly recommended.

In all its simplicity, Shadespire is a very straight-forward yet strategic game. I love how it plays fast and how every character is unique, but I can't shake the feeling that the game is heavily dependent on luck. Maybe the finer strategic elements will reveal themselves as we play more (and add the additional cards to our decks).

I guess that Warhammer players will enjoy Shadespire, for it is fast and brutal enough: sadly though it’s way too fast for anyone who isn’t familiar with Age of Sigmar and, maybe, even happens to despise this new setting.

The miniatures are nice and finely detailed too but the Sigmarines still look...clumsy: it’s not just the three included in this game but the whole concept and looks of these empty shells turned into golems being wrong.

RATING: 6
Admittedly, this is after one play...
Shadespire is a tactical abstract with card driven action (supported by custom dice)

Honestly, this is weak as piss.  but my friends seem to love it!

Pretty light on depth...  my kids would find it pretty good, but me I think it's middling at best.  The minis are great, the cards are not great (almost like crappy punch boards) and the tokens are mediocre but passable and the dice are fine (smaller than I expected buy I may be picky - really they're fine)

The real question here is "How much do those expansions cost?".

This game isn't "worth" $100 AUD (when compared to other games at that price point) but if the expansions are more than $30-$40...  It's hard to imagine spending $200 plus on a game this weak....

EDIT: The expansions come n at $50 each...   Ouch!

As a fan of miniature games but lacking both time and space to play some of the bigger games this is ideal for me.
The game is fun and fast paced with a great deal of strategy provided by the cards. With every element of the game from the choosing and  placing of the board onwards having a significant impact on the game there is a great deal of replayability within the core set. 
The minis are fantastic, sacrificing none of gw's usual quality despite being push fit. With a minimum of 8 warbands confirmed and a reasonable $30 for expansions (especially by gw's standards) I can see myself playing this game for a very long time.

RATING: 8
Now this is something a little different from GW's usual releases. An extremely tight little tile-based skirmish game with a whole array of variable strategies. There is a huge amount of variety offered by the different warbands, and the sculpts are brilliant. I only wish traps, dangerous terrain sections, ploys that integrate both, and distinct rules for some of the objective tiles were included - given the backstory, rules additions of this nature would make sense. The deck-building aspect and ability to customise a warband to different playing styles is superb. I hope this sees plenty of support going forward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Games Workshop has always been a good miniatures company, but the actual games they made, when it came down to it, were very mediocre.  Even their headliner games like Warhammer 40k and Age of Sigmar, these games have awesome miniatures but the game design, balance and mechanics are passable at best.

This game seems to be different from their usual MO.  This game has a reletively tight ruleset (some ambiguities, but this is to be expected from such a complex game in its infancy and should be addressed in time), depth of play and tons of replay value.  It is playable right out of the box, but has tons of room for expanding and customizing ones playstyle through ones objective and power deck.   Games only take 20-25 minutes (suggested to play best of 3) and the game is very aggressively priced, particularly for a GW product.  

I think Games Workshop has created a winner here.  If the company continues to support this game with regular errata's as well as continued tournament support it could become a real pillar of competitive miniature gaming.

Good, tactically rich game that offers an experience similar to imperial assault skirmish but streamlined. Good miniatures dice and tokens. Set in the age of sigmar universe with two factions I find unappealing or I would probably buy.

RATING: 8
I see many comparing this to Warmachine/Hordes or X-Wing, etc. I see how the comparison would be made but they're entirely different. This is a small box game on a board with very few miniatures, the others are larger games with more time(and money) needed to invest into them. This is buy, assemble a couple things and start playing. Very accessible. As a hyper competitive player, it is more simple than other skirmish games but there's enough there to enjoy whether you're entering the miniature scene or you're experienced.

RATING: 9
As a person who is intrigued by skirmish or war games but discouraged by the fact that it demands huge amounts of money, lots of time and ability to paint miniatures and patience to read huge rulebooks in order to understand fiddly rules I find this game a real gem. This is the best gateway for such type of games because it gives you everything you need right away in the box. All you need is just one core set that you can actually find at a very decent price.

Concerning the game itself, it is an excellent one. A fast-paced skirmish where you have only 12 actions per game may seem underwhelming at first, but then you realize how precious every move is because you have so little of them - and it is great, because I love games where decisions feel important and have the actual impact. Randomness is pretty significant here and some will surely get distracted that it is completely luck based game where dice rolls determine who's the winner and who's not. Yes, it is an important factor, but so are your tactical desisions, proper positioning, risk management and... deck building! Cards play a HUGE role in Shadespire, really. They allow you to do some nasty things such as swapping two miniatures, making the attack that failed again etc. Timing is extremely important, knowing when to play a card and which card is the key to success - because you're allowed to have only one copy of each card in a deck! Some of them are upgrades which permanently change statistics of your miniatures or give them special actions. Those improvements, such as +1 move, +1 defence and so on may seem rather small but considering that EVERY move and every miniature has a massive value it is important to know when to upgrade and what to upgrade. 

However, the most outstanding element is an objective system that allows you to pursue basically any strategy you want. Sure, you are restricted to some extent, because some cards are attached to a specific warband, but you also have a plenty of general ones that every faction can use. Not only every warband itself differs from each other and has a different playstyle - you can also diversify possible strategies by putting different objective cards in your deck every time you play. You don't necesserily have to kill your enemies - it is completely possible to win without taking a single minitature out of action! Given that objectives are the main source of glory points(which are victory points and a resource spent to upgrade units), they determine the player's strategy. You want to go offensive, defensive, area control or mix it all? No problem, just put right objective cards into your deck and follow your goals. 

The only drawback I can see at the moment is the publishing policy(which probably couldn't be better anyway) - if you want to be really competitive - well, this is a tournament game at its core, basically - you have to buy all of the expansion packs even though you don't want to play some of the warbands. The reason is simple: those expansions come with a variety of cards and most of them can be used in every deck. For example, at the moment only Orruks expansion has cards with ranged weapon. If you want to use them you have no other option than buying such a box, even though you don't want to play the Orruks themselves. Some people acquire these and then sell the miniatures and keep the cards only. That is some solution, but still. Anyway, a truly great skirmish game that plays so fast that it is impossible not to play best of three or best of five series! I hope the game is going to be further developed and I'm waiting impatiently for the upcoming Skaven expansion!

Although designed with tournaments/competitive play in mind, this starter box works perfectly as a self-contained strategy combat game. All the components are very high quality and surprisingly easy to assemble.

There some inevitable errata/FAQ due to the flexibility required for expansions but these are relatively easily "house-ruled," even if they official FAQ hasn't picked them up.

RATING: 9
This has everything that I love in gaming in a single box:  strong 2-player tactical play, strategy in deck construction, short play time (30-40 minutes), depth of choices, high production values and amazing miniatures.  Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, comes close to the quality of miniatures that Games Workshop produces these days (2017).  Their detail, posing, and plastic kit engineering is light years beyond other companies, and that includes CMON or Privateer Press. 

Shadespire appears to only be getting better with the release of more warbands.   It will be tempting to collect everything for the game.

Two criticisms:  (1)  GW isn't used to writing competitive rule sets.  As such, the language and keywording here could be tightened up quite a bit.  It's a little sloppy.   (2)  There are some critical dice rolls in the game, and you don't really roll a ton of dice in the game either, so luck can definitely bite you on those key rolls.  It's a valid criticism but only a small part of the game as a whole, so I'm not too bothered by it but I can see where some folks will be.

RATING: 9
Having just played with the starter decks to this point I have to say I am very eager to see where this game can go once I dive into the deck customization. The issue with this game doesn't have to do with the game though, but the stigma and assumptions associated with Games Workshop. Really this is a game that could and should be aimed at the tactical boardgame crowd because they'll love it. But keeping it with the AoS and 40k offerings means that many miniature gamers will look over and board gamers won't see. It really is a quality game that I can tell so far, but it feels a bit mismarketed.

RATING: 10
GW's best specialty game since the original WHQ. Out of the box you have a 100% complete game. It is, without a doubt, the best core set ever released for a skirmish game. The rules are simple, but not dumbed down. Each turn is overflowing with tough choices. The games are short, tense, and a ton of fun.

Best game of 2017.

Quick Summary
Pro
* well-written rulebook (english)
* variable & balanced player powers
* great looking snap together miniatures
* core set miniatures can fit inside the box
* deck-building element
* tile boards will not take up a lot of space 
(if two player only)

The game in itself though is a hexbased game of positioning and risk mitigation, objective conquest and timing.

Con
* wording on some cards could be done better
* i have doubts this can be used in tournaments.

From a modeling perspective... amazing!  Great minis and small model count.  This means I get all the action of a warband but minimal hobby time invested in painting them.  Let's me paint lots of unique models for very little entry price.  I think the warband are 20$ us a piece!!!  It really is a great deal!

On the game play.. Fast, tactical (both at the board level and card level),  easy to pick up, and luck can be minimized (always a factor though) with smart movement and card plays.

Wow, the best Games Workshop boardgame to date. Excellent components (....the box even got an inlay, wonders never cease...) and superb, minimalist but highly tactical gameplay.
In terms of objectives vs. killing it feels almost a bit like Battlelore 2nd. where achieving objectives/VP matter at leas equally to just killing opponents units. (I like this!) Also, comes with a VERY fair price and awesome miniatures that paint very easily.
Fantastic product and an absolute winner that quickly became my favorite skirmish game alongside Battlelore 2nd. and Mystic Battles: Pantheon. Well done, Games Workshop!

RATING: 6.5
Leginkább battlelore light-nak nevezném ,mert rengeteg hasonlóság van a két játék között. A legfőbb különbség, hogy ez sokkal gyorsabb, sokkal kevesebb az egység, sokkal hordozhatóbb. A játékmenetet nem teljesen éreztem balanszoltnak, mintha lenne azért elég exploitos stratégia bizonyos oldalon. A teljesen alapdekkek újrajátszhatóságáról nem vagyok meggyőződve, szerintem pár party alatt uncsi lehet, de a pakliépítés opcióval ez biztos megoldódik. Pláne az új frakciókka.  Sose gondoltam volna, hogy gw játékra ezt írom, de: jó ár-értékarányú darabnak tűnik, amit ráadásul akár még nyaralásra is el lehet vinni, ha valaki egy kis társasozására vágyik esténként. Mindenképp van létjogosultsága, pláne hogy 8 nagyszerű minit kapunk hozzá, ami nagyon a festés elkezdéséhez.

Das Spiel hat uns nicht vollständig überzeugt. Es handelt sich um ein kompetitives Spiel für 2 Spieler, welches unserer Ansicht nach zu sehr vom Zufall dominiert wird. Würfel und Handkarten können einen gewaltigen Einfluss auf den Ausgang der Schlacht ausüben. Zudem sind wir uns nicht sicher ob es der Spielbalance zugute kommt, dass eine Seite der Fraktionen immer ein Missionsfeld zusätzlich zur Verfügung hat. Positiv ist, dass das Spiel schnell aufgebaut, die Materialien übersichtlich und das Regelheft ausführlich geschrieben ist.  Die Figuren sind ebenfalls von guter Qualität, wobei bei uns der Kopf einer Figur nicht wirklich ausreichend festgesteckt werden konnte. Generell ist ein Kleber aber nicht wirklich erforderlich.Die Spielkarten selbst hinterließen  gemischte Gefühle. Ziemlich schnell zeigten sich Spuren des Gebrauchs an den Kanten. Einige waren schon im Auslieferungszustand leicht markiert.

Underworlds is a very addicting game with easy to learn rules. It can be played in a short period of time (about 1/2 hour) and is also quick to set up. It will be fun to see this game evolve with future expansions since each expansion will add cards that can be used in your custom decks. The miniatures are VERY high quality and the game tokens and boards are nice too. 
The only reason I rate this game a 9 instead of a 10 is because the cards used for the power and objective decks are of somewhat shoddy quality. You can clearly see the cut marks on the edges of most cards and the cards in some of the expansion sets do not match the backside colors of the cards in the starter set. If you plan to play competitively, you will pretty much have to buy card sleeves that cover the backsides of your cards.

RATING: 8
This is a great skirmish game--the way activations are handled is neat, the tradeoffs introduced by the movement system, the cards, the modularity...
All that said, some plays will be marred by a lot of weird die results. Given the tight timetable of the game, the low figure count, and the low numbers of dice rolled, crits can take on a hugely outsized significance. In competitive play, you're supposed to play two out of three, and that may be the best format--if you can keep the playing time quick enough.
I am increasingly of the opinion that a game should not have both attack dice and defense dice. Recent FFG designs, for all their manifest faults, seem to have internalized this.
[EDIT] And the expansions are pretty boss.

I didn't know what to expect when this game was first announced. I'd been told it was a miniatures game, but it clearly is not. I tend to avoid card games, as all too often they boil down to taking the perfect netdeck list, or having to spend excessive amounts of money to buy the winning cards.  

Shadespire manages to pull off a mashup of board game, card game, and tactical arena game. While luck looks like it could be the main factor in how a game goes, I've seen time and time again that luck doesn't hold much control and skill does. I've played games where dice rolls are heavily in one person's favor, but their planning and plotting with the right cards in hand has them pull off a surprise win at the end.

Shadespire has earned a perfect rating from me, and rightfully so. The game was crafted in a very balanced way, with enjoyable gameplay at the forefront, and still manages to reward skillful thinking, planning, and tactical forethought more than many other board game I've played.

If you're up in the air, get a demo from your local FLGS- you'll understand what I mean after you've played.

Fantástico juego, mezcla de juego de cartas y miniaturas. Además de hacer las típicas acciones de los wargames de minis (mover, combatir, tomar objetivos...) el juego añade la construcción de una mazo de cartas que nos permite hacer acciones extra, reaccionar a las acciones de nuestro  oponente y equipar a nuestras tropas con objetos y mejoras. Además cada jugador diseña su mazo de objetivos en función de sus gustos y estrategia. Estos objetivos nos darán puntos al cumplirlos que determinarán el ganador de la partida.

Partidas rápidas (solo 3 rondas) y muchas estrategias posibles, lo que da pie a una altísima rejugabilidad.

If you have 20-30 minutes to play a fast game, Shadespire is awesome for that, if you'd like to play a more complex deckbuilding game, this is a very good game for that too.

RATING: 9.5
A very fast paced tactical skirmish game. Easy to learn and hard to master. Deck building adds to variety. Expansions make this game even better. Just needs a new board pack and a way to buy cards without rebuying the core sets and expansions which I'm sure will come soon. (Also, hyped for the skaven!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Only have played the core game and not any of the additional groups.  Also not playing this competitively as a caveat.

This is a good tactics (as in FF tactics) style miniatures game with some upgrades and action cards thrown in as well.  This sits very well in the Warhammer universe, which is a theme I enjoy, and the two different groups are both interesting and enjoyable to play, though I prefer chaos more.  

The initial time you play this will take a little bit longer, but once you get the flow down, you can get through a game in 30-45 minutes and often times you can easily want to play more than one.  

While this hasn't been brought out for full game days that I still get to do on occasion, it does sit in between opener game and the main game for the day, depending on if we're waiting for additional people or there is food breaks or what have you.

fast-paced miniatures combat game, which offers more tactical choices than I anticipated.

after buying the first two expansions, I feel a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of cards, which definitely obscures its overall appeal for me. And even though there are a lot of cards, you cannot really pre-assemble a deck for each faction, if you only own one copy of everything. This means, I cannot simply start playing with a friend, if he happens to choose a faction I do not have a pre-assembled set for.

RATING: 9
[2017/10/30] Played two games, both as Bloodreavers.

Underworlds nicely balances player skill against lucky rolling. Which dice faces count as successes in opposed combat rolls are a matter of attack profiles, relative position of the miniatures, and cards played out of your hand - that is, stuff you can control. But first and foremost, the players compare how many critical results they rolled (one possible on each die). Whoever rolls the most crits is going to win the opposed roll. Other than trying to roll more dice (and possibly more crits), your tactics only come into play after the crit comparison is settled. Some will hate this; I think it is perfect for a fast, brutal game. Keep in mind that one-shot kills are not rare - so relatively rare lucky escapes seem justified to me.

Moreover, winning is not necessarily a matter of combat rolls. The objective deck play means players who have lost all their fighters are still in the game (and may even be able to win). The objective deck also keeps the tension on, as games may be much closer than you would think just looking at how many fighters are wounded/out of action. There are so many decision points for cardplay in Underworlds, and ultimately more room for rewarding clever play than lucky rolls.

Customization is very restricted out-of-the-core-box: warband rosters are static, many of the cards are warband-specific (some are even character-specific), and there are currently only four boards to play on. Expansions will help mitigate some, but very far from all, of this lack of customization. There is a lot of game in the core box, however, and the included factions seems very well balanced.

Played in the ~10th times ballpark now, I feel comfortable to say this is a very, [b]very[/b] good design. Gameplay is fluid, with a nice balance between card play, miniature positioning and luck of the rolls. 
All in a very fast, straight-to-the-point, high-rhythm package. Surprisingly "meaty" (wait to judge it properly, gents).

Easily strikes all the right chords to me, I'll play anytime soon and see myself doing that for a long, long time.

Heard good things about this, but it ended up being a pretty basic miniatures skirmish board game. Throw a dart at anything from Fantasy Flight's catalog that is in the same genre, and you've likely already played this. At least GW is starting to show their ability to adapt to the times, I guess.

A phenomenal 2-4 player tactical skirmish game with incredible production values!

Streamlined and easy-to-learn rules, perfectly balanced and completely asymmetrical factions, gorgeous minis and other components, as well as deep customization potential are just a few of the fantastic features of this game!

The only downside I can think of is the high reliance on luck, but thanks to the short playtime (~30 minutes), if you get hosed by poor dice-rolls, you can just start over and play again!

This is a quick, easy gladiatorial game. The maneuvers are well conceived and the balance or asymmetrical forces seems well balanced.

[Disclaimer - this is only based of two players, and only with the basic decks.]

Opened the box, and no issues with cards, tokens or models. Surprised to see GW had supplied baggies, which is always a help - it's almost like they've started to listen. ;)

Had a read of the rules, and it seems simple enough, but with enough tactics, deck-building skill and (of course) luck to be engaging.

Played two games at my local club, just using the basic decks, and it was fun but, on initial feelings, it does seem to hinge quite a bit getting some objective points early, especially the Khorne warband. I did offer to swap sides with my opponent after the first game, but he wanted to give Khorne another go, so ended up with a 10-1 and 12-1 in, both times wiping out the Khorne fighters for no loss of my own.

But I don't think it will always be like that (I had some lucky crit rolls, my opponent missed a lot of attacks).

Will happily continue to play it, but think the game will improve further once some of the expansion races are added.

  A smart move by GW to recruit gamers   who don't want to paint scores of miniatures or play one   system as a lifestyle.  This is a rock solid skirmish game with beautiful production values--and a nice hybrid design that appeals to gamers of all varieties looking for a great way to get  a taste of Warhammer without having to eat  a four-course meal. Although I enjoy it with three players, the game shines at the two count--

After over a dozen plays, I am convinced this game is the real deal.  It is by far the best board game GW has ever released. For a miniatures skirmish game, it has a nice learning curve, the game can be taught in one session, and folks have been getting involved in strategic planning quickly.  I'm very excited to see the future expansions and how organized play works.

The two basic warbands are very different so it's hard to judge how good the game is from just a few plays. The first impressions are good though. 

The rules are very straightforward and easy to understand. The various types of cards, objective, ploy and upgrade add depth and replayability to the game. Dice and the luck of the draw keep everything feeling tense and there are lots of surprises every turn.

It feels a bit like Summoner wars with miniatures. The use of objective tiles on the board might even make it a better game in the long run. The biggest problem I can see is that there can be a runaway leader problem, but a single game is played in just 3 turns, so you only get to have 12 actions per game. Ideally then, the game is over quickly and you can play again. The second problem is the heavy dependance on luck to do really. I'd like to see a slightly more deterministic combat variant.

I can't quite decide if Mythic Battles: Pantheon is a better game. The card play is less interesting but the gameplay gives more opportunities for use of terrain and tactics..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
So enjoyable that I bought two copies to try out the 4-player game with the added bonus that I get a set of extra dice and the ability to play symmetric matchups of the two base armies against each other.

The objective cards should keep 3 and 4 player everyone-for-themselves games fast and entertaining too.

Shadespire is easy to learn for a GW game, and its streamlined gameplay, in which clever cardplay is just as important as strategic positional play, feels quite unique. And the miniatures, while requiring some patience to assemble for a non-miniatures hobbyist, are very detailed and dynamic looking. A good game, particularly if you have limited time to set up and play a miniatures game, bit still want to.

Had a friend teach me this game today. Never really felt into it. Sure, it was a fun little game, but I'm not in a hurry to play again nor will I purchase it. The theme is a downer for me. I do think this is cool to see GW acknowledging modern game design ideas and implementing them, but there's nothing this game does that other games don't do better. I would much rather be playing X-Wing for a quick tactical battle, or Warmachine/Hordes for an engaging tactical skirmish. Felt like a dumbed-down version of Warmahordes, despite the use of activations, decks, etc.

[i]Excellent - very much enjoy playing.[/i]

[b]This game is surprisingly fun and accessible![/b] It can be swingy at times, but good positioning and risk mitigation are much more important to victory. Unlike other tournament games, you don't need any of the cards in the expansions to be competitive and win big. It's no chess, yet my friend and I really had a blast. The game is short ([b]15 minutes[/b]) and cutthroat. It doesn't outstay its welcome and leaves you longing for one more match!

I played a couple dozen games with the default decks and we're still testing new tactics and moves. The replay value of the core set is good. I can't wait to get my hands on the Skaven and Dwarves. The models are gorgeous.

The card quality is questionable. There are minor inconsistencies in color, forcing me to rely on opaque sleeves. At the time of this review,  the corners on the expansion cards are more rounded than on core cards. I expect better quality control in the future.

Simple to grasp but with great tactical depth.  Lightning fast to play, but you'll want to play several rounds.  Fast paced enough to hold my wife's short attention span, but with enough complexity to hold my interest.

This is a hit for the new GW - accessible easy to learn and fun. I have been able to hook four board gamers in a week of demoing just in my small group. Combines a perfect mix of deck building, miniature positioning and dice rolling to make for a very exciting and deep game that plays in twenty minutes. Don't underestimation this game after you first play - the deck building makes it really strategic and twelve total activations make every tactical decision nail biting. Once you see how much of our fate depends on your decisions and not the dice - you will want to come back for more again and again...

Great game for two people. It preety much adds everything i like in boardgames. So we have deck building, some randomness with dice, tactical planning and most of all Warhammer atmosphere. 

I am a great fan of a games that has fluff and a story behind so this one I enjoy a lot. What is more this game is fast so playing a single game can be up to 30 minutse if both players already know all the rules.

It also has a great potential for competetive playing. 

And what is most important for me Skavens are going to be next expansion.

Warhammer Underworlds is a fantastic game and offers the best of both the Games Workshop hobby combined with the fast paced game play that Board Gamers love.

The reversible game boards are well made and printed with high quality in mind, offering unique surface to play on as each tile side changes model deployments and movement obstacles.

The models, as usual, are Games Workshop's forte and have been sculpted perfectly and are perfect for the first time model builder as the are snap fit, the plastic comes in colors so you don't have to paint them if you don't want to, but the detail of the models really shows when you do paint them up.

Game Tokens are fantastic resources and there's a token for every action and reaction in the game so no action goes unnoticed.

There are currently 437 cards in the collection, each card is numbered, not all 437 come in the Underworlds box which means more are coming down the pipe in future boxes and expansions, the cards themselves are beautiful the art is fantastic and the quality is high, Player Cards are double sided for when your Characters achieve their inspired stats.

Overall game play is just fantastic, probably smoother play than X-Wing and that's something I never thought I'd say.

Well done game.

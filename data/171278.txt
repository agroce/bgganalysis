Great game. Comparable to Mark Simonitchs operational games in complexity and historical plausibility. Lots of excellent chrome through the support markers. Check out my AAR and review on 'The Gamebox'

Too few plays to judge this one, but game is unplayable live. Also game seems similar flawed in overpowering Germans as in "Liberty Roads" to enable German player fun from play.
Unwinnable campaign game for Soviets due to reinforcements rule, which allows Germans to magically appear in OOS cities. Bad, bad, game. Highly not recommended.

All Eastern Front aficionado's must get this. Admittedly I have only played one scenario (twice) but the atmosphere generated is incredible. Brilliant counters, maps and play aids. The support concept in this game series is a "tour de force", not only does it bring the game to life with historical detail and characters, but also adds plot twists to the flow of play and nice graphical counters too. 

The Bagration scenario is an epic trial of strength versus flight of foot maneuver and riposte! And still playable in one full sitting which is a feat of design and development in itself.

An EPIC tour de force of the East Front from June 44 to the end. Builds on standard boardgaming structures (basic odds ratios but no ZOCs) with innovations (support markers, elite units, exploitation attacks, etc.) and twists, adding to the tension and ensuring no two games are the same! HIGHLY recommended!

While I appreciate the clever system which prevents a continuous offensive across the land, I didn't like the oft confusing rules and the final denouement wherein a city cannot easily fall because reinforcements or replacements can be placed there regardless of the supply situation.

Rating is 9 if I play the Soviets and 8 if I play the Germans.  Campaign game turn 1 should ALWAYS see the Soviets in Minsk at the end of the turn.  Getting two fronts on the move assures an interesting game.

My overall impression is that Hexasim has a winner here. It is on par with the quality of Liberty Roads. They have done some very innovative things to represent the Soviet offensive structure. I really felt, whilst playing the game, i had the strengths and limitations of the Soviet high command.

The graphics are awesome, the map clear, and overall beautiful. Game play was smooth, but very long. This is the Eastern front after all.

I was very happy that i could change the soviet offensive as i wanted to start with. Next time i will probably go after Romania, as you dont want to let those german divisions escape.

Now the bad part. The victory conditions are unrealistic. A Draw is if the Soviets capture Berlin but the Germans hold all the other five? So, somehow the Soviets make a two hex hole straight across the board, ignoring all the rest?

Soviet marginal is never going to happen either.

What is really annoying is that the soviets historically received a decisive or strategic victory. I hate the fact that if you do as well as historical, you get a strategic victory?

There are much better ways to make a victory system that still includes the strategic objectives, and the Hitler track. 

This is a great game for several people. I think three would be good...two soviets and one german. Perhaps a fourth german. Combined with Liberty Roads and you can get a group of five to six together to play. 

Hopefully someone will do the linkage between the two systems. If not, there is always the Might Endeavor to play!

As i conclude and make a final rating...i will start with my Liberty Roads rating of 8.7 to which i add 1 point for new innovative ideas like how to handle the soviet war machine, cool new supports, and the strategic locations for the germans and the collapse of the reich...all cool ideas.

The game loses a half point due to its length. It would lose a full one, but there are three scenarios, for which Hexasim even made bigger hexed maps on the back side of the main map! But for the campaign game it took me four hours to play each turn (soviet and german) times 24...and you get 100 hours. Now, i am slow and it was the first time through the campaign game, so...but i would be surprised if you finished this in less than fifty hours.

[while i still think the game is too long for my tastes, i am not sure it is fair to degrade it a half point for length. This is an amazing game, and if you like the Eastern Front, you will like this one.]

I HATE the victory conditions, first because i feel them silly, and second because a historical result is a soviet decisive win. Not much room for improvement, and a lot of room for failure. But, since i dont see this as a tuesday night get together with the guys game for competition, i only knock one point off.

My next comment may seem unfair, given Hexasim stated they were not going to link the two games (Liberty and Victory) into Conquest Roads, but i dont care. The gaming community wants it, and wants to know where the heck it is!!!! So, a loss of ONE points for this.

Net result, 8.7 + 1 - 1 - 1 = 7.7

Wow! The same base system as Liberty Roads but with 3 times the map space and 4 times the counter density. This is a BIG game and is very satisfying to play, however it will be much less manageable than its smaller cousin.

Awesome production value.  Every component is perfect, typical of Hexasim games.  The same system as Liberty Roads is now utilized to the eastern front where the Soviet made final blows to the German Reich through Belorussia. The maps are back-printed to accommodate many scenarios. A sense of profundity is arising. Superb! Can't wait to get it onto the table.

Very interesting product, the map is most excellent (back printed: great!), as is the game system (Victory Roads!).

Alas, the counters are a bit small, but more importantly their graphics are way too garish and busy, the important info is buried under them and makes the counters very hard to read.

Okay, I asked for an Eastern Front version of Liberty Roads and the designers delivered.  The system has adopted well to the eastern front, but I find the full campaign daunting.  My review may change a bit once I find time to do more than play a scenario.

The "supports" continue to do a good job of abstracting the Christmas stocking feel of support from higher headquarters to individual German armies and Soviet fronts.  You never know whether you're going to get Tigers or coal.  Well no, you never actually receive a lump of coal, but some of the supports seem like it.  You make the best of what the High Command sends you.  That's part of the charm of the game.

The division/corps scale works well for the full Eastern Front, as many previous games have shown.  Play is fast and fairly simple Igo/Ugo with fairly conventional rules.  The system is good fun with room for thinking, but not a great deal of memorization beforehand.

Materials are the usual Compass Games first rate.  I'm one of those who greatly likes the divisional coats of arms on the German pieces, but others find the heraldry a bit distracting.  I don't think there's much clarity hit for this improvement in artistry.  Joy and bliss, the maps show absolutely no reaction to changing humidity.  If you live in a soggy climate, this is a big deal.

Bottom line: a nice playable wargame with a range of scenarios taking anything from several hours to several days.

A recent visit to Hungary and Poland (December 2016 - January 2017) made me want a game on the Soviet liberation of eastern Europe and the final destruction of the German armed forces in the Second World War.  So I bought this.

I have played one of the small scenarios.  The game works well and flows easily.  I can see why it and its sister game of the Western Front have been so well regarded.

I now want to play the campaign (of course), but this will have to wait its turn.

Impressive package. This has small scenarios which work well and the big one. The big one looks daunting but somehow due to the low movement rates, is manageable even solitaire. 

What should not be overlooked:

- the power of the supply tokens. They are key to the defense of the Germans and the offense. 
- The special rules for TOs. Keep them in mind at all times.
- The elite ability
- The way exploitation is needed for breakthroughs

Highly recommended for solo players. German players might need some stamina.

Amazing game on eastern front subject one of the best treatment about Bagration offensive and further. Rules are simple but clever. Very difficult (read nearly impossible) to soviet player to achive his victory condition despite a steamroller number of forces.
Sop despite unbalanced victory conditions the game is really fun and enjoyable.

Brillante adaptation du système Liberty Roads. Tout en reprenant la base, le concepteur a su ajouter les éléments pour rendre l'historique de ce front. Conséquence tant le volume de jeu que le nombre de règles spéciales ont augmentés pour une courbe d'apprentissage importante --surtout pour l' URSS il me semble mais les règles restent assez simples ; c'est la gestion de l'ensemble qui nécessite une bonne réflexion. Les parties sont passionnantes y compris les scénarios bien pensés pour comprendre le système. Production matérielle impeccable.

Cependant, la présence du concepteur pour répondre à certains points de règles et le scénario sur Berlin seraient bienvenus.

Victory Roads is a classic Igo-Hugo wargame at heart. There are significant enough complications to increase the player experience to a high level. We played the campaign with five players and got three quarters into the game after some 35-40 hours of effective play. The results was a strategic German victory. With reasonable competent play on both sides it seems really hard to win for the Soviets. It takes a long time to finish the game, and it will almost inevitably end with the Russians being far short of their objective.

We liked the basic system, as well as the Soviet supply system and the Fuhrer track. The support rules were fine, but was over complicated in the many alternatives available. Some support chits are significantly better than others. These over complications are true for several rules. Haltbefehl is also far more complicated than necessary. At the same time the rules allowed the Germans to get rid of Himmler by simply placing him in the frontline with a chicken in one hand and a luger in the other until the Soviets just had to remove him. Of course only for Himmler to reappear later on, having evidently escaped imprisonment. What a maverick!

This boils down to the fact that this is an excellent game with too much chrome. Just keeping track the rules for Haltebefehl, Horrah attacks, armored exploitation and elite status is hard enough. Then add 15 different support counters per side, that can have quite an effect on the game. 

In general we did not have that many rules questions and the system mostly worked fine. The overall quality is top-notch. Graphics is outstanding. The rules are clear but it is rather hard to find some rules in the book and the player aids could have been clearer as well.

It is also a bit unfortunate that Bagration is such a puzzle, and an important one to solve. If solved the Germans have a much harder time getting organized in Army Group Center since most units will be eliminated out of supply. Taking Minsk on the first turn is crucial.

In the end, this is a game that keeps coming up on the table. That is a very positive verdict in itself, especially for a title that takes some time to finish. At the same time I have the constant urge to make house rules. Support chits, exploitation, haltebefehl, the Hitler mood table is just a bit to complicated for the benefits. It could have been a more streamlined experience. The house rules would all be about simplifying processes.

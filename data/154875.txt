RATING: 3
In solitaire games I understand you need a system for generating random events, but in this game it's pretty crude, for example: after a successful patrol sinking n ships, roll 1 - 3 to get a unit citation, or roll 2d6, on a 12 you get a letter of reprimand. 

The escort detection is a nice addition, it's easy to get spotted repeatedly and each detection will almost certainly generate damage to your sub.

P500. I liked it as a historical simulation, but as a game, it's mostly random dice-chucking to see if you survive or "level up" after encounters.

Fast & Fun. Sometimes almost feels like a rpg. Charts and dice, but with lots of suspense and taking crucial decisions. One of the best solitaire games ever. If you want to get into wargames start here. It's an adventure.

Lives up to its reputation for providing a tense narrative in a persistent campaign. 

The historical homages are a nice touch. The game, while ultimately a lot of dice chucking, gives the impression of being on the hunt in a WWII submarine.

Two patrols in and loving it! Great balance of risk and reward.

10 patrols in and bumping to 8.5. Have sunk 66k+ tonnage and completed 3 special missions. Finally have better torpedoes now need to find a convoy. Favorite moments were when I've spotted ships without escorts and sent them to the bottom with the 5" deck gun!

Great game that gives you great tactical choices for every engagement. Now with better torpedoes I can't wait to try out night surface attacks at long range on multiple targets with both fore and aft torpedoes!

RATING: 8
This was really fun! Sure, there's a lot of dice rolling and this means that the result of all of your choices will be left to chance. But that mechanic also makes it easier getting into the rules and helps keep the pace up! I still truly enjoyed contemplating when to attack, which ship(s) to try and sink, and when was the right time to flee. A great submarine simulator for 1 player, with "meh" rules for 2 players.

I finally had the time to play my first patrol last night (21FEB2016, or more accurately, very early this morning).  After posting that session, the designer responded with helpful information that addressed my major questions and concerns.  I had missed an errata which makes the game even better, so I bumped my rating from 9 to 10.

I think it's technically slightly better than The Hunters, but I just don't get into it the way I did with it's predecessor. I think it's the theme; I'm not American, and the U-Boats just interest me more than the US submarines. 

Regardless, it's a solid solo dice game and I expect to play it at least a few more times before I switch back to my beloved The Hunters.

An elegant and easily learned system that does an excellent job both of ratcheting up the tension and of providing a detailed and accurate portrayal of the Pacific sub campaign. 

The fact that a career can be played from beginning to end in a reasonable time frame is also welcome and ensures the game never becomes stale. 

One of the best solitaire-only wargames I've yet encountered.

This is my first war sim game, and first single player game. The manual is massive with little pictures, but very easy to read and learn.

I really get into this game, and before I know it, 3-4 hours have passed. There are lots of dice rolls, and checking charts, and really little strategy. 

One of the major issues are all the rule erratas in the forms.

Each logged play represent a complete game-either sunk or end of war.  This is an excellent tactical level sub game.  It is a dice-chartfest and can get repetitive if you play for to long in a single sitting, but it offers so many choices!  I like the combat resolution and detection cycles as they play so fast and seamlessly. The player aids are excellent and keep all the information right at your fingertips during the patrols.

Long awaited, arrived 5 Feb 2016. Punched, clipped, and sorted the same day. I also gave a copy to my son, who is a US Navy submariner like his Old Man.

This is a fun game, easy to play, with lots of decision making opportunities. In my opinion, worth every penny, and it does a good job of telling the story of my heroes, those brave young men who made Pacific war patrols.

A wonderful and challenging game, like its predecessor, with top-notch components (the patrol maps are an especially nice touch).

It will be getting a lot of table time.

Had Hunters and U-Boat Leader but prefer this for its more developed campaign mode. Also, the Pacific arena seems wider and more open if you're a submariner and to give you a better chance of surviving the war than in the cold, stormy Atlantic as patrolled by Walker RN, that rightly renowned vanquisher of U-boats.

Solitaire submarine game (seems to support 2 players)

This game seems extremely heavy and abstract. Just to determine encounters you need to pass through 3 tables. This game as a huge amount of table and it seems just very annoying.

Almost NO real choices to make, no tactic nor strategy involved, you're just rolling some dice on various tables, and wait to see what will happen, for me it was just impossible to get involved, it's a really very very poor gameplay for a 25 pages rulebook game in which you are pretty much only a spectator!!! I'm over disappointed. It's just like a very very bad game book with a 2 pages scenario...

[b]8: Very good game. Rarely disappoints me. High on my request/recommend list.[/b]

Based on two play through of 8 patrols before being sunk, but this game is much improved over the basic concept of The Hunters. The greater variety of awards, the unique bonuses of the various sub commanders all combines with the excellent narrative created by its parent The Hunters. All told, very good all 'round.

Each to their own, but I really don't get the love for this. Just a really dull dice rolling fest with endless chart lookups and no meaningful decisions.

I love this game!! An entire patrol can be played out in one sitting.

A very immersive solitarie game, where you are in command of an American submarine in WW2. Although in this game the story drives your experience, there are important decisions to be made, and you will feel like a true sub commander. 

However, its decreasing difficulty (since your sub improves as the war goes on) makes it a little easier at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is all narrative and the stories that it tells are full of tension and elation. There's really not all that much control you have in the game, just a few things like which if any sighted targets to attack. Other than that this game is roll dice, consult tables, then play out the result. This is very much a simulation and one that's purely about the experience. It's very god t what it does, because you get out what you put in, and as an avid role-player this comes naturally to me.

An instant classic.  For me the game reaches a high point of perfection for a solitaire experience.  As good if not better than the Hunters and totally engrossing.  I thought it was rather easy as my first career survived the war fairly unscathed and recording and an amazing 55 kills.  Second to last mission got me the Medal of Honor and I even survived two minefields through some lucky dice rolling.  I really enjoyed it but thought it too easy until I started my second career and lasted only two missions before getting sunk on the coast of Japan.  It looks like Clark Gable and I got it at the Bungo Straits.  Just when you think you have this game beat it wakes up and bites you in the ass.  And I loved it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent game that perfectly scratches the submarine itch. Detailed, yet overviewable rules and a clever little campaign system. Intense gameplay choices and risk-taking. Only in your own head, of course, but somehow the solitaire experience reflects the isolation and patience needed for submarine warfare.

I've been exploring my new copy of "Silent Victory" this week. Like many I played "B-17 Queen of the Skies" a lot in the past and see the similarities.

Like B-17 the mechanics of the game form a framework upon which to imagine the story of the war career of a submarine commander and crew.  It takes a good imagination to fully experience this - something that many but not all board-wargamers seem to have.  If you just want to play and "win the game" this won't satisfy, but if you want to explore the challenges and decisions a sub commander faced this is a good game.

RATING: 5
The comparisons of Silent Victory to B-17: Queen of the Skies are apt, but I'm not enamored with either. Although SV has far more details in terms of weaponry, historical dates, machinery, and awards than does B-17, it requires even more rolls and more steps with only a little bit more decision making per turn.

The chances of your sub hitting the target are about average; the chances of the torpedo being a dud are about average; the chances of the escort that is accompanying the target(s) discovering you are about average. So Silent Victory is built with a lot of 50/50% chances--coin tosses essentially--that can be affected marginally by a player's actions (many modifiers are +1 or -1), and the end result is an average "game" in which the player basically connects various charts and presses his or her luck by flipping a (metaphoric) coin.  Partway through my first game, I was tired of the multiple step bookkeeping used to determine the approximate boat size, the exact boat size, and the boat weight for each encounter...and writing statistics down for a board game in tiny boxes is never fun.

I like the idea of measuring submarine success by the tonnage of ships sunk, and there are some nice details (eg. the damage repair system), but I felt that B-17 better used the three boards--those all have thematic visuals that illustrate the battles and game world.  The SV boards are two charts with chit boxes and a map that has no play value (but should have).

I understand (but do not share) the nostalgic B-17 fascination, and that game has some very compelling components and innovations working synergistically, but Silent Victory is a new solitaire "game" and doesn't have that quaint yellow musk. Compared to contemporary solitaire gems like Thunderbolt Apache Leader, D-Day at Omaha Beach, and Zulus on the Ramparts! and also the classic solo adventure, Ambush!, Silent Victory is a dry, chart-oriented simulation centered on an endless series of press your luck dice rolls.

RATING: 7
I ordered this after playing and loving The Hunters, and I think in many ways this is the stronger of the titles -- component quality, rules, etc.  And I adore games that tackle the Pacific theater so I'm really glad this exists.  I've had a lot of fun with it so far and I think I will continue to do so.  But a couple of things make me enjoy The Hunters more:
First, Silent Victory's historical trajectory is such that the game is frustrating at one end and easy at the other -- but generally in the reverse of what one would expect from a game.  The first several patrols are an agonizing chorus of clangs, as dud after dud bounce off ships.  Historical but kind of annoying.  In contrast, the last patrols are massacres.  Especially if you've got some decorations or crew promotions, there are patrols where every ship I encounter goes down in flames, and with acoustic torpedoes and jammers I barely have to worry about the escorts.  By this point in the game I'm often racking up a Navy Cross every time I leave port and wishing I was retired.  Contrast this to The Hunters, where the final months of the game are terrifying white-knuckle rides after the kill frenzies of the early war.
The other thing I enjoyed more in The Hunters was seeing how I compared to historical tours of duty.  In Silent Victory it's easy to go on a dozen patrols, which, given how infrequently that happened in real life, means that one's total tonnage is likely to be among the best ever if you survive the war.  I could limit myself to a shorter number or try some of the historical patrols...but I don't feel drawn to do that for some reason.

Played an entire campaign,  still a good game,  but I never felt that endangered when attacked by the Japanese, maybe I just got good dice rolls.  Stay at medium range, never go in to get close range attacks,  and take your dud hits early on and I think you have a good chance to survive to later and take out more ships with fewer dubs.  I still like it, but I had to drop my review some because of the lack of real tension.

Very familiar gameplay for players of the predecessor, The Hunters. Smallish changes for the change of Theatre and nationality, a few additions such as naval combat with subs and warships.

Every sunken ship is a small victory; don't expect to see the same tonnages from The Hunters. In my first game, I frequently scored exactly one (1) damage point with ten (10) torpedoes fired. Crazy. In the end, even with a Rabbit's Foot reroll, the Commander was suddenly washed away in freaky giant wave. Dice just hate me.

Fantastyczna symulacja działań na Pacyfiku amerykańską łodzią podwodną. Gra jednoosobowa. Absolutnie fenomenalna.

RATING: 6
The only classic card game with any kind of real excitement level. Tension rises as the discard pile gets bigger -- one false move and your opponents will rack up the points! There certainly is some strategy here -- or at least a "correct" way to play -- as experienced players will trounce newbies every time. The Hasbro edition sucks (just look at the photos here) so stick with the Winning Moves offering, currently available on their webiste for $4.

I really enjoyed this game with 4 players, with 3 it is not as enjoyable, and with 2 it is playable but better card games out there, like Cribbage.
 I actually have not used the Caliente variation yet, but the cards are pretty and add some color to entice newbies. Canasta is challenging to play well, and like many card games has a psychological aspect. Just remember that teammates are not allowed to communicate except to ask "May I go out partner?"

[i]Posted: 10/23/12, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]Canasta Caliente[/i] is apparently a variant of [i][thing=17104][/thing][/i] -- shocking, I know.  It is a Rummy variation using partners, where the value of your initial meld increases as your team crosses scoring thresholds.  So what makes this game so "caliente?"  As far as I can tell, it is having the point values of cards clearly marked; a "Stop" card (although there may be a similar provision for "Stop" in regular [i][thing=17104][/thing][/i]), and some 100-point bonus cards.

All of these frills result in a game that feels like scoring is chaotic.  It makes sense, eventually, but wild point swings are very possible.  As with any [i][thing=15878][/thing][/i] variant, control of the discard deck is vitally important.  Often times the first team to seize the discard deck ends up winning that round.  The other trick is to manage your hand size: it is tempting to play all of your cards as you go.  However, if you get down to having only one or two cards, then you can't play a set after you draw and still have something to discard.

My wife and I have friends who love to play this game, and they consistently beat us.  Another annoying property of this game is that I just can't seem to get better at it.  I'm sure this frustration is reflected in my rating, but ultimately I would choose a different game to play if possible.

I bought this out of desperation one day when I was on vacation and had forgotten my games.  It's not a bad game, but the cards from my edition are flimsy and seem like they will wear out way too fast.

I will probably end up donating this game before it gets too worn.  I can't think of a better use for it.

This is an OK adaptation of the traditional Canasta card game.  I really like the fact that the point value is not only written on the cards, but is also color-coded.  Plays fairly well, but the additions to the traditional game are very miniscule.

RATING: 6.5
We love this game and break it out when we want a relatively simple card game. The rules are sort of like Gin Rummy and relatively easy to grasp or explain.

The game plays pretty quick and there is still room for strategy with being able to go out concealed. The Caliente card adds fun to the game. One thing I would change is to add some reverse cards(similar to Uno).

Warning: it can cause shouting when in the heat of the game and someone goes out when you were about to do something big, leaving you with a hand full of points! I kid in this regard but my wife's family has been known to yell at each other during the game =P

We enjoy the game and break it out when others don't know what to play. We have the actual game, but it can be played with two decks of playing cards.

This isn't the most exciting game, but if you enjoy rummy, it can get quite tense as you struggle to discard something that your neighbor won't use to pick up the discard pile.

The Caliente cards aren't bad; they allow a team that's lost control of the discard pile a chance to get back in the action.

A great classic game of the rummy family.  We prefer the variant "Samba" over Canasta, but they get played equally.  The only 'flaw' in the game is when the prize pile gets large.  Everyone knows the team that finally wins it is going to rake in the points.  It can be frustrating.  But it is still a great game! (This problem is solved with the variation called "Jonola Canasta"  I'd love to try it, but can't find the rules!)

The game took three hours to play.  It slowed to a snails pace as we got closer to the end and each player needed 120 meld just to hit the table.  At this point the game tuurned into "who can draw two big wild cards".  It would've been considerably more fun if it was shorter.

Fine old cardgame with a couple of new changes.  Actually, we've played without the caliente cards and still find the special deck worth it for newbies because it has the point value printed on each card.  Having now played with the caliente cards I like it even better.  Inevitably, both end up in the discard pile by the end of a hand making the decision to pick-up a lot harder.

Wife and I have played this a few times. Not really a bad game, not really a great game, maybe a good game. My score just went up a point because I just learn that we were playing the game incorrectly. The 90 and 120 point meld minimum could be done with 1 or MORE sets. We had been playing that it was just one set to make the meld minimum, which fixes most of the problems I had with the game.

This is wrong -->(The games start out fun, but by round 3 or so the 90 and 120 point meld minimum cause each player to draw a lot of cards before layout down. This really slows down the game. Also the overall game takes a bit longer that we would like from a game of this game weight. If this game took 30 minutes or less every game I would rate it a bit higher).

This is a great way to learn, teach, and play Canasta. The point values of the cards are printed on the cards so you do not need to remember those details. The actions and meanings are also on the cards, so you do not need to remember things like what a black 3 or a red 3 does. (Actually, these are renamed "Stop" and "Bonus" cards, making things even easier.) So, if you are an infrequent player, this is a great advantage. In short, the deck is its own one big playing aid!

Enjoyable card game for two or four. I know you can play it with a normal deck, but the cards here are, first of all, very nice looking, and secondly make it much easier to score. Though we don't play with the "Caliente!" cards, as that bit seems kind of dumb.

RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Draw and discard your way to collect sets of cards. Get more sets then your opponent then go out by getting rid of all your cards.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: It's a relaxing game of fairly simple decisions that can be played socially or just to kill time. Even with that, there are opportunities to have some fun by taking an opponent by surprise with a well timed play.

Cons: Not a great amount of depth. The game almost plays itself out after a number of plays. Bonus cards are over-simplified, completely random, and un-needed. Game is probably a little long for being as simple as it is.

Other: This is the most complex game my grandma likes and plays. I don't mind playing it with her as it's more about spending time together then the game and this works perfectly for that. My score is no doubt higher then other rummy games because of this.

Best use: Playing one-on-one when the person's company is more important then the game being played.

Canasta is a great game. This version (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/20006) makes it just a bit easier to learn, faster to play and score, and just a bit more enjoyable. The cards are visually appealing, much more so than standard playing cards, and are also of very good quality. Haven't used the "Caliente" cards yet, but I think they would be especially useful when playing with three players, probably unnecessary when playing with partners.

1 partial play (just 1 hand, 3 newbies).

A nice rummy variant: partnership (sit across from partner), 1 meld area/team, play with 2 normal decks and 4 jokers shuffled together, may only meld sets (not runs), random bonus 100VP if you're dealt the right card (silly random rule like the flowers in Mhing), wild cards worth 20 or 50VP (wilds may be used as part of meld but in initial meld the majority must be non-wild), need at least one canasta (meld of 6 or 7 cards) to go out, cards are worth 5 / 10 / 20 VP, first meld must be worth at least a specific VP (higher requirements as your score gets higher -- catch up mechanism), can pick up the entire discard pile if you can use the top card immediately in a new meld, get negative VP for cards left in hand if someone goes out, special STOP cards prevent next player from taking discard pile (discarded wilds also act as stop cards, as well as "freeze" the discard pile: to take the pile, you must make a wild-free meld with the top card). Play to 5000 VP.

Hard to evaluate after just one hand, but it seems like this could be a lot of fun! As a learner, I'd much rather play with this deck vs. regular cards (so I don't have to remember 2s are little wilds [20VP], jokers are big wilds [50VP], 3s are ... stops?, etc.). However, the game's been around so long that I'm sure people who've been playing it a while will prefer the more basic cards.

You can also play with an extra rule, but we didn't play it and I don't remember what it is!

The Hasbro edition of Canasta Caliente is nicely functional with the points on the cards, the card quality is good and the graphics are decent. The  variant with the two "Caliente" cards that allows players to replenish their hands is an OK twist on traditional Canasta but might be a little overpowered.

Canasta is rich, fantastic fun and the hard part is finding four people to play.  This will have a resurgence if the economy continues to sour as it is cheap to procure.  The Caliente version does spice it up appropriately.

From the way this game plays, it appears to be best as a 4-player partnership game, but it's a nice Rummy variant, and since my wife likes Rummy games, that's a nice bonus.  The Stop cards become fairly useless in a 2-player game, and serve pretty much as a useful discard, but otherwise the game has some nice mechanisms in play.  I'm eager to play it as a partnership game to see how it plays there.

When you flit from game to game as I do, re-learning the specialized functions of the cards in a standard deck was just enough trouble to make playing Canasta a problem for my gaming group.

Highly recommended for people who would like to play every now and then, useless for those who are serious fans of the game.

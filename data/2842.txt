I thought I wasn't going to like this given its reputation as a light filler, but it's actually pretty fun. I enjoy that it's all about being as lazy as possible - letting other people link to your network rather than vice versa, and making the moves that keep your goals secret until the last minute.

My wife and I play this one. Works quite well for two players. Nice, fast, friendly piece laying, race game with a train theme. Also, a nice lunch game with the guys. Plays well with 3 and 4 players but I'd be hesitant to play it with more as it would simply end to quickly and with little input on strategy.

One of those "for the whole family" games that can be enjoyed by kids with their grandparents.

I don't feel like I have much control over the outcome in this game. The game feels like it is determined mostly by luck, and a bit by where players put their hub pieces. That's probably good for a family game that's meant to be played with kids, though.

I wouldn't want to play this game all the time. However, it is good. I think that for the amount of time it takes to play a series of games I'd rather just play Ticket to Ride. But it is fun, and works well at the end of a gaming night when people have to leave at varying times.

A very simple train game, connecting cities by placing tracks. It's a very quick-playing random affair. Your card draw in the first stage of the game makes-or-breaks your chances of success.

OVERALL: Neat little game, light. Use the "colored" block rails, which I guess is an expansion to really make the game.

An OK filler. Nothing special. Flavourless.

2016-03-30
TransAmerica is themed as a train game. Ok, you can see the connection and it does not bother. However, in reality you are just laying down pieces of track as fast as you can along the shortest possible route between cities. No resource management, market speculation or any of that common train game stuff here.

The trick is that you can use the tracks other players have laid down to connect your cities. Thus you are not always taking the shortest route but the one that gives the least free rides to your opponents. Naturally you are a freeloader yourself, so you are constantly calculating the benefits you give and receive from a move.

The best part of the game is when you are still trying to figure out where everyone is going. After you know (or you think you know) the destinations of all players the game is reduced to a zero-sum calculation excercise. Fortunately this stage does not last that long, and the game is of reasonable length as whole as well.

In my opinion, it's one of the best games for non or starting gamers due to quickness, balance, and easiness to learn.  However, it can get overplayed due to the limit of choices.  I recommend it as a filler for a bigger game in a gaming group.

I find this game wholly uninteresting. I try to mix it up by trying different strategies, but that doesn't seem to perk my interest. My bf always wins and he keeps telling me that the key to winning is to make other players build over the 2-road spots and take the most direct route possible. I can't take: (1) always losing and (2) being told what the winning-ist strategy is! Played Transamerica several times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 5-10 times).

I really like train games. This one gets classified as one, but it's so heavily over-"euro'ed" I don't consider it to be. 

Stripping a theme down to its essentials may be one of the hallmarks of a good euro, but this one goes so far that it loses even its connection to its alleged theme even by the often-tenuous standards of euro games. What's left isn't fun. So no thanks.

RATING: 7
The filler of choice at my games club for the last few years. Easily explained and light as candyfloss.  Wonderful when others build where you want them to, terrible when you have to complete a long section yourself!

I own the 2016 Rio Grande edition, which increases the box size by about a quarter so that there's more empty space for the components to rattle around in.  Replacing the brown player colour with black to match the track seems to invite unnecessary confusion.  It's positively annoying to those of us who own the Vexation expansion with track in the player colours.

Okay, like, this game has a fun concept but it is too much based on luck, though there is some strategy.  I will play for a quick game on BSW, but not often.  I wont be buying this one.  My guess is that it will be even more time consuming IRL, which would probably drag my rating down a point (to 5.25)

This is much more strategic than it first appears, especially with six.  This is a game about waiting out the other players, and/or extorting them to build connections for you.  I'm really unsure about the vexation expansion, as it seems to lose much of the depth of the unmodified game.

A light filler game.  Adults find this more interesting than kids.  My 8 year old niece loves games, but would probably rate this a 5.  On the other hand I have played this with a 5 year old, and she enjoyed it.

An obvious predecessor to TtR, so it gains some kudos for that.  Vexation is a requirement for this game to make it strategic.  It plays quickly, and the game end mechanism helps move it along.

After 40+ plays on BSW I found it in my local game shop and purchased it immediately.  I knew my wife would like it (she does) and it could be used as a great filler or introduction to gaming game.   I have played an additional 20 or so games so far and it lives up to my high hopes.  Everyone who has been introduced has enjoyed it the first time, and have suggested it for a second go.   If you are loking for something light, easy to explain and quick, this could be your game!

Over 300 plays and still enjoy it.  On BSW I'll play it with any number, F2F I prefer it with 5 or 6.

RATING: 7
Okay game.  Seems a little boring with two players (and totally based on luck); maybe the variant involving the moving starting stone would make it more interesting.  Without some knowledge of where your opponent is trying to go, there is no way plan accordingly.  Many of the games I won by placing a single rail off my girlfriends track network, and this was only because my city lay next to it.  Had I drawn a different city, I still would have depended on her network, but would have not been able to connect before she finished.

RATING: 9
This game is a superb filler that doesn't rely on an ideal number of players to make it work. It is also a game that is enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike, and certainly one I would recommend to families with children approaching the early teens.

p: There are a few games all of us happily agree upon, and rarely do we have objections to a game of TransAmerica to round off the night. We have thrown out the end of game triggers in favour of the obvious as-many-rounds-as-players system, and keep a running score to determine the overall winner. Seems much fairer as everyone gets to start once, and since it plays very fast it will keep people engaged even when the full compliment of players is present.

Compulsory complaining about the "worst ever" cards dealt only adds to its enjoyment, even more so as it is usually followed by an even worse set in the very next round. Amazing!

Light railbuilding game.  Secrecy and timing are key elements in this game.  Players are invited to deduce where their opponents are attempting to connect cities.  In turn, they can expand on these efforts and get a "free ride" towards their own destination cities or go it alone and build their own rail.  Game plays very fast as rail networks are built and multiple rounds are usually played to determine winner.  Good intro rail game overall, but lacks the depth of others available.  UPDATE:  +2 to 8 when played with Vexation expansion.

Totally baffled on my first game of this. Actually I was totally beer buzzed. Started to get the hang in my second game. Quite simple actually. Seems like a good gateway game for non-gamers and a good entry point for gamers not yet familiar with train themes.My second session went much better. I see how bad luck could totally mess you up in this. Perhaps there should be an opening bidding round where the winner (presumably the owner of an unlucky draw) could somehow win a bid to go last so that he gets optimal placement. My strategy so far, draw good cards. Barring that, try to build into other people's track so that I can connect my cities in as few turns as possible.

Rules to remember:
* In first turn, each player places start marker in turn.
* In second turn, players begin to lay track.

NEW COMMENT:  Must be played with the Vexation variant/expansion.  There's not enough strategy for the base game to be worth my time.

PREVIOUS COMMENT:  Okay every now and then.  Luck predominates... both in card draw and where opponents play (especially newbies).  There's a lot of riding coat-tails of other players.  The trick is to get others to do the work (build routes) for you; careful choice of start position is important to accomplish the trick.  It has some bluffing and strategy, but this game doesn't do much for me.  **NOTE: the Vexation expansion adds just enough strategy to make this game "okay".

Pretty simple filler game that feels like a condensed version of Ticket to Ride.

Everyone has 5 cities to connect that are hidden goals, except for the starting position that you may freely choose. You may lay two tracks per turn but only connected to the track system your starting city is a part of.

The key is gauging where everyone wants to go and deciding whether to connect to the other track systems to broaden your (and the other's) movement options. Luck is a factor, but withholding information by not going directly for all of your cities and correctly timing when to go for it could gain the margin to win.

First to connect 5 cities wins the round. Everyone else gets penalty points according to steps needed to reach the unconnected cities. The game ends exceeding a predetermined threshold.

I've never seen the attraction of this game.  It seems like the people who have to reach the corners inevitably lose.  Our last game was one point from ending on the first round when one player got every single corner city on the board, and no one had the second furthest.  It was an impossible situation to recover from, and I don't think those should ever happen by luck alone in any good game.  Thus my low rating.

Why do people like this game?!  (Actually it is more of an activity than a game.)  Some say it has subtle strategies but I have yet to see anyone articulate them.  Official variants are no better.  A huge disappointment.  If someone has a decent variant that turns it into a real game, please let us know about it!  It seems like there should be a real game hidden among that board and bits somewhere.  If you want a simple, light game try &quot;Paris, Paris&quot; instead...just as easy to learn, but playing it actually MEANS something! (Update:  I recommend using Ralf Gutzeit&#039;s variant for selecting cities...see &quot;Possible Variants&quot; on the game page.  This has raised the game to at least a 4 in my estimation, and rescued it from my junk pile.)

My first play was disappointing.  I'm not sure I see any strategy at all here - he who gets the best cards wins, with the subtle twist that the best cards depends on what everyone else is holding.  To some extent, you can help yourself by guessing where everyone else is going, and finish the other stuff you need first.  But really, the end is determined by the card draw, so it's a (slightly) more complex version of War.

Ok, everyone complains about their cards as soon as they get them... it's part of the game.  And one can get a cruel set of cards that are really difficult to complete.  However, for the vast majority of play, it's a nice quick game with fairly even and competitive routes.  I really like how there is a cooperative/competitive element to the game.  It's also about maneuvering to the easy passes through the mountains and along the coast.  One of my favorite games.

This is a nice light train game. It is easy to teach. Everyone gets a city from each of five regions of the country. They have to be the first one to get all their cities connected.

Bumped my rating up a point after several plays.  There is a luck element, but being good at deducing where other people will build and only building where you know have to (because nobody else will) is skillfull play that will more often than not win out over luck of the draw.  Best with at least 4 players; I think 5 is the sweet spot.  With 3 players luck of the draw plays too strong of a role.

The outcome seems overly determined by your initial card draw, even in the two-player game when you remove some of the cities. My fiancee won twice in a row when, both times, I had two cities on opposite sides of the coast, in regions where she had no cities, but all of my cities in the heartland were directly next to hers. Grr. Might improve with more than 2 players.

Such a simple game but there's more to it than there looks to be and the frustrations of joining all points of the board is made very enjoyable; it's traditional to groan as you have a first look at your cards and how far apart they are.

Not sure what to make of this. On the one hand, it plays quickly and is very easy to teach and learn, thus making it accessible to almost anyone. On the other hand, it is hardly worth the effort to play; Streetcar, itself a very accessible game, is superior in essentially every way. It also seems like it is a big advantage to go early in the round since you get more turns, and the game is usually decided by only one turn of track play. All in all not a bad game, but not one that's going to keep me going for very long. A little pricey for what it is.

Not our cup of tea.  Seems like not a great 2p game to me.

Played again...it seems too luck-based to me.  Once everyone is sharing the same track, which happens fairly early on, then it's just a race to finish and entirely dependent on the luck of the draw as far as who pulled cities closest together.

It's fine for a quick filler, but just doesn't engage me all that much.  I do find it interesting that you want avoid doing too much work for other players, while capitalizing on the work of others.  Overall, a fine little network game that just doesn't excite me all that much.

RATING: 10
A game of purely parasitic conflict. Your goal is to do the work that no one else will do for you first, and then use the network that others have built to connect to your final cities. I love that type of conflict.

In this game the leeching and blunting are quite subtle and so it's difficult to know when you are doing one or the other. However, the difference is still critical because if two players are leaching off of each other, and two other players are blunting each other, well, the two leachers will end with fewer points that the two blunters.

I like how the game seems simple, but once you get good at it, the decisions become more complex.

It does suffer a bit when playing with newer players, because mistakes with tile laying (like building through someone else's city (when it isn't to your advantage to do so), or building closer to a city than is necessary) can end up randomly helping out players, making the game a bit more chaotic and giving people victories out of the blue. However, that is more present on the Europe board than the USA board.

Quick but ultimately pointless. I don't believe there is any strategy to this at all. If your cities are grouped closer together than your opponents and/or your opponents inadvertently assist you by building your tracks for you, you'll probably win. There are better gateway games than this.

After my first exposure I thought it was okay, nothing amazing, but certainly worth further investment. I enjoy how quickly it plays. It will likely see the table more than some other superior games. It's attractive and I sense there's more to it = more plays. 

Update: it just isn't making it to the table. There isn't more to it, but it's fine for what it is.

This is a nice quick game.  It's all tactical and has a large dose of luck, but it's so quick that it can be somewhat exhilirating.  It's also easy to teach kids to play -- my older son started playing when he was six, and it worked very well for playing with him.

If you're thinking of getting this game, get the Vexation expansion as well.  It gives the game a pleasant whiff of strategy and cutthroatness.

A great game to share with others who don't play games.  Simple enough that I was able to give this as a present to my 6 year old nephew who was able to play it with the "adults".

My wife and I played TranEuropa first. I decided to pick this version up for ourselves. Everything I wrote about TransEuropa applies here as well. I don't see much difference between the maps at the moment, so this is the only version we'll need.

This is a solid family game for the in-laws and other casual gamers. The vexation expansion is almost a "must buy" if you play this with any regularity.

Update: A couple plays with family and friends has demonstrated that this game is fine, but ultimately a bit lackluster. I feel that the game largely depends on the card draws, and if players gain some basic competency, then they'll play out their routes well enough that whoever drew the best cards will close out first. After playing Paris Connection, I didn't feel I needed this one anymore.

I'm glad I traded for this (St. Petersburg). My second play was much more rewarding than my first. While there isn't a whole lot to the game, it makes a good gateway game, good longish filler, has some good tension but not stressful. Seems like initial placement is where most of the strategy is, so placing first you are really just guessing. Good enough for what it is.

RATING: 3
Very light, very fast, not really a rail game in the standard sense.
The variant with Citadels-style city selection is a significant improvement to the game, adding just enough depth and mystery to take it out of the luck-fest category.  I also like Dave Boyd's variant where each player gets one track in their colour and only they may travel over that track.

This is a very simple game with interesting decisions.  Its suitable for a family game, as even young players can be competitive. 

There is enough here for adult gamers to find it satisfying, provided you use the Vexation option, but I think ultimately not the best choice if that's what you're looking for. 

There is significant luck with the card draws, which can be a turn off to people looking for a more mature game....but desirable for a family game.

RATING: 5
TransAmerica is a simple connection building game. Players start with a grip of 5 cards, each with a city from the map of the United States. Over the course of the game they spend actions placing either 2 easy pieces of track, or 1 difficult piece of track. If they connect to the other players, then their track counts for connections as well. This is essentially Iron Road with a slightly different scoring system and a triangle instead of square-based board.

So the strategy here is fairly straight-forward: try to maximize your individual moves and leech off the other players as much as humanly possible along the way. The game is probably best with 3 for a combination of gameplay with control.

Absolutely nothing special, but it's extremely fast and serves as a decent way to kill a few minutes. That said, do you play the game or does the game play you? There aren't too many choices involved in playing this game well...as it largely boils down to hoping that the other players have to go to places near your cities so you can save some moves along the way. In that sense, there is a strong need to lie in the weeds and connect up to cities where you know the other players are not going to move any closer to. Honestly though, I don't think there are a lot of actual meaningful decisions in this game, and your opening grip combined with those of the other players will go a long way to determining how well you're going to do.

RATING: 7.5
This is a simple, clever game, where the winning strategy seems to be to hold back as much as possible and let the other players do most of the work for you.  Freeloading, basically.
I seem to have a knack for it (so far anyway).  I'm not sure if I would rate it higher or lower if I won less.

RATING: 2
Really, the only value of this game is to have something on hand that is extremely easy to teach and easy to grasp so complete newbies can be introduced to the hobby.  Beyond that, this game offers little to seasoned, veteran gamers.  There simply is too little of a game here to really merit repeat play and it's probably the most passive game I've ever played.  Nonetheless, kids can play and enjoy it.

This has become a go-to gateway game for us to play with new gamers. Just about anyone can grasp the rules, even some kids. Even better than Ticket to Ride in introducing trains, maps, routes, etc. People catch on quickly. Even though it's light, I really enjoy playing Transamerica. I like that it plays fast and that we can squeeze in a game even when kids are wild or our guests are short on time. I also like how well TA breaks down more advanced mechanics so that players who have previously played TA are more readily taught games like Chicago Express, for example. 

I haven't followed through, but I've also considered making a travel version of the game that could be played in the car. Rather than using wooden sticks, you could easily just make marks with a black dry-erase marker on a laminated board. I'd probably buy a cheap, travel version of the game if someone produced it!

Excellent, light gateway game - open the box for the first time and in 5 minutes you're on your way.  Went over very well with my 8 y.o., though we played only the basic game so far.  I suspect the vexation addition will help the game once my son feels comfortable with the basic rules.  Good game - need to explore further.

Edit:  Played with vexation which definitely improved the game.  Also, bumping up my rating a notch -- this game is a snap to teach to non-gamers and the ones I've introduced it to all wanted to know more about "these games we've never heard of before".

I played this game back in 2004 on a fair, and could not remember much save that it played very fast and lacked any significant tension in how your moves work out. It was the beginning of my boardgaming 'career', and I decided a '5' would be an okay rate. Nearly four years later I was able to give it another go, and instantly decided that that was much too generous. In fact, I doubt Transamerica even qualifies as a game for grownups to be rated. There is no decision to be made whatsoever save for your initial starting position, and after that it's just guesstimating until someone connects all of his target cities. Now here's a poser for you: the rules are all perfectly fine, there is nothing which breaks them. But neither do they form a interesting set which rewards clever play. How do I rate the game? How do you rate the 'game' of throwing a lot of dice and then deciding the winner on the total...? 

Now as a children's game, if the grid were made a little coarser for the truly young ones... I think it would do very well indeed. It teaches them a little geography and the benefits of having others do your hard work for you. Those are not such bad lessons to be learned.

Production: Attractive artwork for the board and cards, and the tracks are easy to use.  Play: Very simple game; calming because there are obvious decisions to be made.  With no way to slow someone else down, the only real choices to be made are guesses at which sections of track one must lay for oneself, because noone else is going to lay them.  The vexation expansion adds an interesting element, by which players can protect their hard-laid track from being hijacked by others, which also means that even with everyone tapped into one network, different players have access to different parts of it.

RATING: 6
Probably the lightest-weight decent train game.  Has an interesting cooperative/ competitive feel, as players end up sharing a single track network but are trying to avoid helping each other.  Luck of the draw can have a very big effect on the outcome, but the game plays very quickly and appeals to both gamers and non-gamers.  The fact that you don't know the relative ease of different players' goals until the end, discovering pieces of the information as the game progresses, alleviates the luck problem somewhat.  An excellent gateway game.  The Ticket To Ride series uses a very similar basic concept at a step up in complexity.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very much a filler game, but a very enjoyable one. Is simpler than TTR, but that isn't really a plus as TTR is easy enough to play with people as young as 8.

What I liked:
* Easy to teach and play
* Able to use already laid track from other players

What I didn't like:
* A bit simple and shallow, when I get it out I'd be happy to play it a couple of times but its not something I would play lots over time.
* A fair bit of luck involved expecially with fewer players!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is like a much simpler version of Ticket to Ride (although it pre-dated TtR) with less strategy involved. Given the choice, I much prefer TtR, but with the right group and/or time constraints, it's a fun little filler game.

The rules are simplicity exemplified. A fast-playing game with a modicum of strategy. In my experience, turn order plays a crucial role in determining the victor. That makes it somewhat unsatsifying.

This game is sooo easy to learn it's ridiculous.  The rules are contained on one two-sided page (with pictures).  Quick to play, great gateway, and there's actually a bit of strategy/figuring to this thing.  The "Vexation" expansion (for like $5) is pretty much a must.

I prefer TransEurope to this version. Perhaps it's just because I'm European and that map is more familiar but it feels funnier to play on, more places to block.

I'm increasingly beginning to think that my own ratings are more of an "Enjoyment":"Time Played" metric than anything else . . .

I enjoy the gameplay, but I feel a lot is based on luck, or how close to your cities the other players are putting down track.  If there is a city that is in the middle of nowhere and you have to get to it while everyone else is close by and share, you will lose.

Simple connection game where you are trying to connect 5 cities, 1 from each region.  The person who gets lucky and gets cities closest together seems to have a huge advantage.

Hey!  Who wants to play another couple of rounds of "randomly pick five cards with destination cities slightly closer than those of your opponents"?  Yeargh.

I prefer Transamerica compared to Ticket to Ride. TransAmerica is a good nice filler. Transamerica is faster and cheaper.

Ticket to Ride is too expensive for what it gives you compared to Transamerica in my opinion.

I am happy that I have Transamerica as a filler game in my collection.

I'm not sure if I really want to get TransEuropa at this point since I own TransAmerica. I don`t play it that often to justify getting another game just like it. Although, I would like to try it out to see if am missing out.

Connecting colored cities is very simple, fast in TransAmerica. First one to connect his 5 colored cities wins the round. It is a little deeper than it looks. Some strategies. Let the other players do the work for you. Play casually with non gamers. Play more seriously with gamers. Replayabilty is good.

TRADED.

My daughter's favorite. Easy to teach and play. The game can draw kids attention because of the search of the cities, planning the priority of the routes. Later on, the kids can be able to devise their own plans to count on using others' tracks. Occasionally, they can play nice to each other "where do you want me to place a track?".

* Played 15+ times. This game is v. light, and the best filler board game around. Low-ish strategy, but short and satisfyingly fun. Nearly complete lack of control. GREAT family game. New English edition decent price. // Clans nows tops the "filler board game" category for me (more choices and control), but this is still second and plays well for 4-6, while Clans is better 2-3.

One of the worsts games I've ever played, probably even worst. After first time playing I've never gladly played this one (just when players have been needed), because TransAmerica has very little part of skill, and mainly based to luck (whatever cards you draw in the beginning eventually decides your faith if players are good).

[Network Connection, Trains] This is NOT a train game by any stretch of imagination. It's a simple placement/connection game, hobbled by the randomness of each player's objectives for the round. It's also sort of needless to repeat the same thing three times. Shallow and random, TA is nothing more than a barely-tolerable occasional filler, but there are far better games of similar weight out there so why bother?

RATING: 8
Fun game.  Glad I played it and glad I have it.  Definitely looking forward to playing this again.  I've played vs. one opponent (I won), two opponents (I won), and five opponents (I lost).  It's alot more fun with three playing than with two, and definitely way more fun with six playing than with two or three.  Played another game, with three players again (but different three this time), and lost.  Still fun.  Would like to play the Europa version someday.  Played against three people (Charles (grey beard), and Cheryl and her husband) and it was one of the best games yet.  Another 6-person game and it was a blast (even though I and a new player both lost).  Played (but didn't complete; we're down to 3 points each) a two-person game with Mr. Billington.  Not as much fun as with multi-player games, but still fun.  Played a 3-person game today (7-9-2011) and Gayle and I both tied.  Definitely more fun with more than 2 players.  Played this today (1-14-2012) with Mr. Billington, using the 10 cards per person variant a gamer friend suggested to me (and using the colored links for the first time; not part of friend's suggestion).  Game takes longer, but more strategic than luck-driven.  Definitely want to play with variant and colored links from now on.  Back to 5 card version, but still with colored links, and finished the last game today (6-28-2012).  I lost.  Oh well.

Picked this game up on a whim... I used to like Ticket to Ride and games like so I thought this one might be nice.  NICE?!  It's stinking amazing!!!  This game is more fun than I could have ever imagined.  It's as fun with 2 as it is with 6.  Rules are simple, just on a single page, the map is beautiful, the box is portable.  You can play it for 20 minutes and move on, but most of the time we play it for hours and hours.  Love it.  The rating is not for the depth (the game play is rather shallow), it's for the amount of time we want to play it.  Throw Ticket to Ride in the trash (sorry, Alan!), and just keep this.  So much more satisfying with so much less time investment.

Ha, one problem I find with this game is that it's too casual for most people who like rail games, and yet it's got a train theme, so it sometimes scares off more casual players who think they can't like train games.

Both Trans Europa and TransAmerica tie for the cookie in this category. I love the scalability of this game from filler (one round) to 45 minute slugfests. My prefered way to play is the longer match, but we've been known to break it out for a quick match too. In that respect it could have made the top-10 Fillers list too. :-o 

TransAmerica is one of the best gateway games that I can think of.

Currently the filler of choice - - has been hitting the tables way too much for what seems an initially simple zen like game - but still strangely addictive (Rating 8).  Vexation is strange, in that it makes it a better game, but removes the zen-like feel that made the base game so appealing - - if you wanted to play a more gamer game, you wouldn't use vexation but instead go simply to a different game (rating 5 for Vexation) (18/12/08).  UPDATE: A little burnt out on this game, rating now 7 (9/4/10). UPDATE: Actually, still a good game, and I even like vexation as a variant - so both rank 7 (3/1/12).UPDATE: Still enjoyable as a quick lite game and my preferred newbie game rather than Ticket to Ride.  Also much better than the sequel Trans Europa, as the map doesn't seem to be so constricted plus the cards also show the location of the city  (Rating: 7.462, Sept 16)

First time with TransAmerica. Actually, this is a pretty enjoyable connection game, quite reminiscent of Thoughtwave, a game from the 1970s that I used to own a while back. There is quite a healthy dose of luck (maybe too healthy?) but the tension of trying to finish first makes the game work. I could see this as an excellent family game or kids game that would be a nice way to move everyone up from the regular ToysRUs crap. I felt some control in a 2-player game, but I can't imagine what a 4-player or more game would be like!

CCCXX :
A very light game where the objective is to connect 5 cities in 5 different regions of the United States by building railroads. The game is slightly random as you can use other people's tracks and vice versa, but therein lies the fun of this game. A very good introductory game as it can be played with very little explanation.

A simply elegant game for people who don't ususally play games. Easy and quick to learn. Trying to get the other guy to build across the rivers and over the mountains so you can use two roads instead of one is a subtle challenge of the game. Do you start near another player or far away from another player? Another subtle challenge. We do not allow players to put the starting piece in one of their cities. They can if they wish (dubious strategy) put the starting piece in a city that they don't have to go to. Slightly less enamored with the game after all this time ...rating drops 1 point

I went through three phases in my relationship with TA:
1) I thought it was a neat mindless game for 4-6 folks... good filler.
2) I was bored out of my skull with it and never wanted to see it again - likening it to cotton candy (tastes good but doesn't fill you up.)
3) I played it on BSW a good bit and found out how much tactical play there is... and fell in love again!

It's fast, it's easy to teach, it rewards smart play, and I have a blast playing it.

Acquired 6-16-2007.

[Original comment] I like this game. It's easy to learn; the play is simple; and it is mildly challenging. I've played Ticket to Ride many more times than this game, but I like both for different reasons.

May 2009 -- This has become a favorite game for my wife, and the rest of us enjoy it, so it gets played often. I like the fact that play is fast, and games are quick. It's not exactly a brain-burner, but is easy to play and have conversation at the same time.

October 2011 -- This is another favorite game for my wife (along with Ticket to Ride and Take It Easy), and we play it fairly often. It plays very quickly, and there is really no confrontational aspect to it (no blocking of routes, as in TtR), and my wife likes those aspects in particular. It is simple, and only occasionally does any player get caught with a high (negative) score.

2013-November:  Still a fun game, especially when we don't have a lot of time left in a game day.

This game is easy to teach and fun to play. The fact that it handles six players means that it is often the perfect game to start off a gaming event. As players are arriving, there is often that awkward time that you need to have a short game that handles a larger number of players; Transamerica fills this need extremely well.

Excellent little game. New players can quickly grasp the concepts and can do well against experienced players, which means that they are likely to play this or other games again. With six players it becomes a bit crowded, so I would say that it's actually best with four, maybe five. As a two-player game, it's a game of bluff as well, as you try to get your opponent to build your connections for you.

any game i can explain to non-gamers in 5 minutes or less is a good thing. game-play always sucks me into thinking that i will win, until i realize that if i am close to finishing, others must be too. then my heart beats faster and it starts being a race. similar to a feeling of getting a couple of lottery numbers right and holding your breath to see if your luck holds, but with better chances playing transamerica.

Like it's sequel, TransEuropa, TransAmerica is a well-balanced skill-based game with a modicum of luck.  Bluffing people into building your track inadvertantly is the name of the game.  And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Occasionally you feel like there was nothing you could do to improve your position or someone is helping the winning player and another player is on track to end the game earlier than you can catch the leader.  But these quibbles notwithstanding, TransAmerica is one of those games that you like even if you don't win.  It's also short and would work well with primary school kids.  A big thumbs up.

Too heavy on luck and next to no strategy to be much higher but the game is a fun and very light filler game that is enjoyable to pay with people of any age. We played it at the office during our lunch break and had a good time playing this simple and fun game. But The game requires you to draw starting cities and what you get which is completely random makes it so that it is a lot hard to connect the cities or might make it easy for you. The only real strategy that could be found by our group was determining where to start and when to join other peoples railroad.

Overall it is a light and fun filler with nothing much there. Serious gamers may find it too boring to play but causal gamers or serious gamers who enjoy playing light filler games from time to time will enjoy playing this short game.

Fun filler game. Good bit of luck involved with city draws, but surprisingly a game where you don't really care. There is an impressive amount of tension and excitement near the end for such a simple and short game.Beautiful components. A little on the expensive side for what you get (game wise, not component wise), but I bought mine with a Barnes & Noble gift certificate.

Track-laying distilled to its absolute core. You need to enjoy laying track and making connections, because that's pretty much all you do in TransAmerica.

Although there's lots of interaction, there's no aggression -- you cannot in any way hurt your opposing players. (You can, however, help certain players and that's where the interaction comes in.)

Don't pay attention to those saying TransAmerica is random -- they're wrong. Yes, there's a healthy dose of luck, but there's much more skill involved than you would think and better players will win most of the time. The key is learning to play your opponents as much as you play the board. How can they help you? How can you avoid helping them? What cities can you leave for others to connect? Which ones will you have to connect yourself?

I like this much better than Ticket To Ride as a gateway game.  I like trying to figure out which part of the tracks other people will build for me, and when I have to step up and build for others.  It's much more gamery with the Vexation expansion, but I don't often use this with newbies.

3 plays later: Never mind, Vexation seems necessary to give the game a little flavor. I probably wouldn't bother without it.

My own personal go-to introductory game for nongamers interested in the hobby.  It is so simple and grokable.  The planning is satisfying and the timing can generate lots of tension.  And building the map tracks is so pretty and fun, like crayon rail games.  All within a 20 minute time frame!  What's not to love?

Try to connect your 5 cities using as little resources as possible, i.e. try to make use of other people's tracks. Simple and light game. Plays very fast. Some luck. Need to read opponents' intentions in order to plan own moves.

RATING: 5
[Initial Impression: 5] An easy to learn race game. Players attempt to be the first to connect all 5 of their cities. The interesting bit is that no player really "owns" a network of track, so players can quickly reach their destinations by hooking onto another's network and using it. Mildly amusing without much depth, and easy enough that younger children should be able to learn it.

Fun track-laying game that works for all ages. (Kids will need to at least be able to match letters, they don't have to be able to read.) Add the Vexation expansion, which comes in the new edition, for added competition and vexation. This is not really a "kids' game", but it accommodates them quite well. Excellent gateway game.

RATING: 7
Nice little train game, especially if you don't have time for Ticket to ride.

Playing this with Vexation expansion much of the time definitely seems ot make the point swings between winner & loser much greater - in some ways the original TransAmerica game is better (or at least closer) without it.

It would be interesting to play Iron Road someday...

This is an extremely simple, "connect the dots" before everyone else does game. There's some subtle strategy here, if one is willing to look for it. Very quick, with literally no downtime. Makes for a nice filler. Initial rating '6'.

Update (01/16/12): After playing Trans Europa a number of times, and eventually getting a copy for myself, I am disappointed to find that this is OOP. One can only hope for a reprint.

Update (04/21/12) 3 plays: I'm glad they reprinted this. It is as accessible as Trans Europa, but the board is possibly more open than the European map. I'm upping this back to '7', as it is a solid filler.

Update (01/01/2014) 8 plays: This game scales well from 2 to 6 players, but shines with the max number of six, as it becomes extremely cut-throat. The game is so light, that one cannot take it too seriously, so there are some interesting moments. With the "vexation" variant, it isn't necessary, but bumps the game up another notch in terms of depth. It plays so quickly, with very little rules explanation, it is an excellent filler. It is also possible to bring in additional players (up to the max of six), that it works well at the beginning of a game night, while waiting for others. If another player shows up late, they can be thrown into the game between rounds, while penalizing them some points.

UPDATE:  No more plays—that damn [i]Ticket to Ride[/i] bastard barges in, slams down one too many and ends up curbing poor, stupid-brave [i]TransAmerica[/i] in the parking lot.  And, of course, all we do is call 911 and hide under the table.

Fun game. This is a great choice for when you feal like playing a train-themed game but don't want to dive into complicated rules or play for hours on end. You still get to connect cities, and are still rewarded for efficiently building your track, but the simplicity leads for quick and dymamic play. Sure, it's downright random thanks to the cards you are delt, but that's not to say there is no strategy involved (and you can even add a bit more by using the colored tracks, which were included in the version I own), and you can still have a fun time with it.

First played this on April 1st, 2007.  For what it is, it is an fun game.  It's really simply and a quick play.  Not to mention you can play it with several people.  As with all games there is luck and strategy.  There seemed to be more empahsis on luck (which cards you and your opponent draws), however.  You could simply be building the track to your opponents destination and not know it while they build off in a different diretion that didn't help you.  (More often it seemed to be the case).  I'd like to try this again with more people as it would probaly play different with more than two players.  I'd recommend this game as game to play and see if it's right for you and possibly entroducing it into your game collection of games to play on a regular basis. (update, plays better with more people)

Love this game so much and I'm so excited to finally have my own copy! I think of it as Ticket to Ride lite as you are trying to connect 5 five cites, but you get to use everyone's track once you connect to it. It plays well with 2 players, which is always a plus for us.

Meh.  The game is so-so, but I have a nagging feeling that you could just pass out the destination cards and then look to see who got the best, concentrated set in determining the win.  Seems to me that if you get the really out of the way cities, you lose pretty much no matter what.  Perhaps with a small number of players the game would provide more room to manuever and be generally sneaky about connections, otherwise the game bogs down into a "wait for the other player to make the costly move for you" chicken-type game.

Aug08: Actually probably my favorite new game of GenCon08. I know most people think it's way too simple and not that engaging. I didn't agree. I thought it was a challenge to figure out how to most quickly connect all my cities without helping my opponents too much.

The rules are simple, the turns are short, but the decisions are far from obvious. The geography of the map comes into play a lot too. Just a great game. Now I just need to try it with the vexation expansion.

I don't understand the comparisons by some of this game to TtR.  They have similar themes but grossly different mechanics.  TtR is a set collecting game that in my opinion lasts just a little bit too long for its depth.  On the other hand, Transamerica is a much quicker, tactical placement game.  Overall, I actually think that Transamerica is a better game for the time invested.  I originally believed that this game would be horrible with less than four.  In actuality, the wife and I ended up enjoying this much more than expected with two players.

This was our favourite game until Ticket To Ride came along.  Now it's a little too short.  But the concept of building off of your opponent's work is neat.

The rating reflects our view of the game but we would actually never play this since Ticket to Ride came out.

Okay, further play with different expectations has raised my opinion of this game.  It does make a fun filler between more demanding games.  Three rounds is about all it takes to finish a game, and this is usually enough to spread the luck around.  I'll bring it along for a while on that basis.

RATING: 9
I suck at this.  How is that possible?  You win if you can get your opponents to build your network for you.  I must be doing all the work.  It's like the poker adage: If you haven't spotted the sucker after 30 minutes, it's you.

We use this as a gateway game.  It works *really* well in that role.

RATING: 8
This was once my favorite "intro" game for non-gamers.  It's a fairly simple game, but good play will be rewarded over time.  For a while, No Thanks! beat this out as an intro of choice, but after Vexation came out, I went back to this for a while (although I don't like Vexation for a teaching game).  Dominion gradually took over the newbie space, but this is still a good solid intro game.

Something is missing in this one for me; there is not enough strategy to overcome the blind luck in the draw and the decisions of other players.  This game just stinks...rotten...crap!  UPDATE - I played recently, this game still SUCKS...really need to be able to rate a game a ZERO!!!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2010)

2010 was the year I got into the hobby. In that year I, most often than not, liked all the games I played, but Transamerica was an exception, I really disliked it from the very beginning.

The theme is pasted on and uninteresting. The rules are pretty easy to teach, you can do it under 4 minutes. The art of the game does its job, but it isn’t very exciting.

The game decisions are obvious and luck plays a very high role in the game.

Best with 4 players.

The expansion (Vexation) does adds some excitement to the base game, but not enough for me to like it.

Bottom line, TransAmerica is a boring game, one which I was far too generous in my first rating. I will do my best to stay away from it. I sold it years ago. Perhaps it can be used as an educational tool.

Current Rating: 3.0
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When it comes to picking a family game or game for new non-gamers up to 6, it's hard to beat Transamerica.  I'd usually like to play something meatier but the fact that my 8 year old daughter can play and often beat adults is nice.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game. Like Ticket to Ride, it's about building train tracks, but the similarities end there. The strategy is not as deep as TTR, but the game is much quicker and you can dive in fairly quickly. The "Vexation" expansion is worth using, as it changes up the strategy significantly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played this once years ago and didn't think much of it, played it again recently and found it to be fun.

Light join-the-dots, network building game in which the trick is to make the best use of other people's work in building the network while minimising the usefulness to others of the links you build.

Sure it's light and your fate can be determined by which cards you draw.  Still, it moves fast and skill can win out over the cards.  Fun to play with nieces and nephews!

Nice little train game but depends a lot on cards drawn. Easier to manage than TTR:E because you don't have to hold a fistfull of cards. It grew on me and I traded TTR:E for it and another game.
Sold 5/18/16 for $20

RATING: 8
I think that some of the members who rate this game should re-read what the ratings mean.  The number of '5' ratings for this game is huge... a definition of a '5' is "Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it."  How can you call this game boring?  I find every turn to be very tense, especially late in the round.  The game is a lot of fun, and the normal initial refrain: "I have the worst cards you could possibly draw!!" is spoken by every player almost every turn.  Try playing this game against some of the experts on BSW if you think that this game has no skill...   Definitely a light game, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to play.  I think that it's time for some of you to have another look.

Initially I like this a lot, but after frequent playing we discovered the game is 
random. Good/bad cards, good/bad strategy

With most players, the game is quite painful!

Light tactical game of connecting cities; bits are bare-bones but nice.  I've had fun playing this game, though I'd rate it lower if someone proves my suspicion that the cards one is dealt to start the game are the sole factor in determining who wins (barring egrigiously bad play).

Man, I must have a thing for train games.  It seems to never matter how the game plays, it's all about those trains.  That being said, TransAmerica is awesome.  I really love it.  It's super relaxed and watching the rails grow across the board is really good fun.  It doesn't quite reach the greatness of Ticket to Ride (in my opinion), but man, it certainly comes close.  Excellent game.

Enjoyable, easygoing game.  The cooperative nature is nice.  The rules are simple, and there is some skill involved, but not enough to alienate beginner players.

RATING: 4.2
Found this one just plain annoying.  Played with the Vexation expansion, with the blocking.  I think it's because it's SUCH a simple game that the game then becomes distilled into just blocking and messing with other people's plans, in an irritating way like a buzzing little mosquito. I suppose if you remove the blocking it might be less annoying, but not sure how much of a game would be left.  On the other hand I could see the base-game-only possibly being a nice Tsuro-like meditative experience.

Game seems to work well with non-gamers I play with when I can't convince them to play or try something else.  Nothing really stands out with the game as I would prefer to play other games than this.

RATING: 7
Wonderful, simple train game.  MUCH better than Ticket to Ride in my book.  I love how it plays so quickly - like a card game with multiple hands - and a full game consists of several rounds.  Yes, there's a lot of luck, but that's part of it's charm.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple but fun as a quick filler. Place the tracks to complete the route connecting the cities on your five cards. You can use the other players' routes to improve efficiency. Players have three chances to block a route. I suspect the game may be driven a little to much by the luck of the card draw.

RATING: 9
In the Very Simple Train Game genre, TransAmerica is generally a minor afterthought beside the mighty Ticket To Ride franchise. But while I agree that TTR is an excellent gateway game, I do feel that a large part of its appeal is smoke and mirrors - it gives the non-gamer the feeling that they're playing a much deeper game than what it actually is, and makes them feel smart because they understand their objective, they accomplish at least some of it, and they don't get buried on the score track. But if you boil it down TTR is largely luck of the draw, drawn out close to an hour and dressed up in a whole lot of pretty production.

TransAmerica is, of course, also largely random. This is the Very Simple Train Game genre, after all. But it has many things to recommend it over TTR:
- it's even simpler than TTR, literally teachable in just a few minutes
- setup and teardown are very fast
- scoring is very simple and there's rarely a question about whether something has been scored correctly
- it takes about half the time to play a complete game
- it plays as several rounds, giving one the chance to change tactics and correct for previous mistakes in-game
- it reveals itself, as players initially feel their cities are horribly spread apart, then figure out after a couple rounds that the spread is less important than what the other players are doing
- which ties into another plus, the angst one feels when assessing one's cities followed by the hope one feels when seeing how things are going to sort themselves out
- and another, that TA has a sneaky player interaction to it, where the key is not to attack others or stop them from doing something, but rather to opportunistically make use of what they've done whilst being careful to help others as little as possible
- while TTR has long cycles of lather-rinse-repeat, TA moves very quickly and dynamically within each round
- the in-game chatter in a game of TTR generally consists solely of bureaucracy - "I'll take 2 face down cards" "I'm building from Toronto to Montreal for 4 points". TA's simplicity and passive-agressive nature lend themselves to more amusing table talk.

TA does have a significant deficiency in that a person who falls far behind in the first round will be playing the remaining rounds with very little chance of winning the game. But winning a round is satisfying regardless if you're in contention for winning the game.

The one game I have played the most. About 100 games on Brettspielwelt and another 100 on another boardgame site.

There's much more to Transamerica than is obvious on first sight. Luck plays some role but with the right strategy you can twist chances a lot to your favor. Plays quickly and is easy to explain. What I admire, is the ultimate simplification of rules while maintaining everything constituting a game. Perfectly suited to casual gameplay, anytime, anywhere. The perfect definition of a game I will always enjoy playing.

TransAmerica (TA) is about building a continuous rail route across the United States.  In that respect, it is reminiscent of Ticket to Ride (TTR).  But TA goes about things a different way.  It is a little simpler to play but still absorbs full attention as each player seeks to take advantage of the opponents' routes while constructing to accomplish his own goals.  As with TTR, TransAmerica employs cards to determine destinations.  Then it becomes a race to connect all the destination cities first.

Victory is determined by points, but only in the sense that each unfinished portion of track in each building round acts as a demerit.

I highly recommend it for families.  It is also a good light game for an hour's enjoyment among gamers.  Because scoring is on a demerit system, the more skilled the players, the longer the game lasts.

RATING: 6
When approached in the right spirit and with accurate expectations, this game seems fulfilling.  I like how quickly it plays.  I'm not sure how much control you have, but surely a more experienced player should come out on top most of the time.  I think this could scratch the itch for Ticket to Ride every once in a while.  It also seems like a very good introductory game if stuff like Ticket to Ride or Settlers would be too complicated.  It also seems like it'd be good for children as well.

This game has really quick and fun gameplay.  Unfortunately, unlike other train games where the outcome is somewhat dependent on what cities you need to build to, the winner in this game is determined 100% by who gets the best cities (randomly drawn cards).  This is the Euchre of train games.  It is still a good introductory game to play with non-gamers though.

RATING: 5
A connection game where players join their links into a shared network. You try to make additions that are useful to you while not being as useful to others. While I commend the designer for not heaping lots of extra design elements on a simple idea, I'm not sure that all by itself it works that great as a game. At some point you'll just be down to lowering your score penalty by 2 each turn and hoping the round won't arbitrarily end. As pointed out by Morgan Dontanville the scoring system is also awkward, as getting hit the hardest in the first round (due to bad luck or whatever) leaves you in an almost impossible position.

Harald Gruber's computer version works well as a solitaire-like activity while listening to the radio; I prefer my own various custom maps to the ones from the board games, and always play to 25 points.

This game has a Ticket to Ride feel but is much simpler and quicker.  There is only one track color.  Anyone can use the track to complete their route as long as it is attached to their starting pawn. The simplicity is great because sometimes I only have 30 minutes to play a game and one can easily play 1 - 2 games in that time period.  I can also play this game with my youngest, who is 7.  He is not able to play Ticket to Ride; his hands can't even hold the cards. But, in Transamerica, you simply lay down track, either one or two; that's it.  He is able to do that.

Very easy, simple and rather random game with a train theme, but basically a point-to-point connection game. Luck of the draw for the 5 cities determines most of the game. Ticket to Ride is similar in concept, but a better game. ***** The expansion Vexation improves the game a lot! ***** Owned: Iron Road - Winsome Games - Special Essen Edition #48 of 60 games.

Not a bad game. I enjoyed it but was a bit disallusioned by the scoring system of several games in a row. In a 2 player game it comes down to who got the luckier draw of destinations but add more players and it can be fun to play some bluffing strategies. Nice for its size and easy to cart around but ultimately I'd rather play some of the larger track laying games.

I've played TransAmerica quite a lot since I got it in November 2003. It is ultra light game with very easy rules and nice game mechanic. Still the game offers enough strategies but there are also luck element (cards) involved. A good game, but when I got Ticket to Ride in May 2004, I think I'll play TransAmerica very rarely. Both games (TransAmerica & Ticket to Ride) are great, but Ticket to Ride offers right amount extra taste of the game so I prefer it's better one.

For balancing purposes, my game club initiated a new wrinkle to re-balance any advantage to going first and/or going last in any given round.  Using pen/paper to keep score, ignore the score track, we play a number of rounds equal to number of players, so that everyone starts first and goes last an equal # of times.  I'll play it either method, with this variant or with the published rules.  It's a nice brisk game and excellent filler.  People who believe this game involves more luck than skill should try to explain why certain players usually seem to do well at this game (there statistics to prove this case, just like Adel Verpflichtet).

Im just a basic railroad worker who does all the hard work putting the routes down then taken advantage by someone to get their fifth city but one day I know it will be my turn.  Very fast, very simple and often very close the game has great replay value and though it may not be obvious there is some real strategy.  Light connection game good for family games and a primer to Ticket to Ride which is a primer to the real heavyweights.

*Is there any chance of printing the European board on the other side and calling it Transcontinental.

TransAmerica is fine as your starting out, but my preference would be - spend a little more and go directly to Ticket To Ride, it's a much more interesting and colourful game that this one - and very similar in some respects as you are building railway tracks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although it is, perhaps, a tad underrated as a "gateway" game, I'd also say that TransAmerica is also uncomfortably close to the line between elegant and just plain simple.

TransAmerica is the network-building game stripped down to its barest essentials, and I wonder if it didn't end up a little too bare. Realistically, there aren't different approaches to what you need to do so much as different orders that you can do it in, and you have to hope that in the meantime someone else fills in the bits you held off on in a manner that you can take advantage of it. While there is some very mild analysis involved, I think that, mostly, it boils down to whether you get lucky or not.

Speaking of luck, getting cities that are scattered to the four winds does not always come out even in the end. A really nasty set of cities can end the game in a hurry, or at least put you far far far out of contention.

In spite of those problems, I think TA is a pretty decent all-ages game, and can also serve as a passable filler for gamers who want to turn their brains mostly off. I am really glad that there are games out there that are much meatier than this as well, though.

Quick, fast and easy to learn. Almost everybody I know likes this game and with that it's a great opening for other games. There is a fairly large luck factor involved but I personally don't mind as it keeps the game in many ocasions close. Best played with 5 people, as this opens up more cities but also leaves enough cities open to 'guess' if anyone is going there. Better balanced than Trans Europe IMO

I like it...but darn if it isnt super random...god I HATE this game. Sold this turd to make money for games that are worth the cardboard they are printed on.

The Good: It has a good idea as a basic premise and the game makes sense....

The Bad: ...until you realize the random destinations can totally utterly hose you and give the game to an opponent or worse than you are forced to help another player, who already has the upper hand, gain an even larger advantage.

Network building game where you are dealt six cards and try to connect those cities.  You can use other players track unless they are using the vexation track in their own color.  

The game seems so light and silly at first, it is not fun.  However, there is a trick to building your track and connecting to other players track.  Good players do consistently win when at first it seems random.  You need about 5-6 plays before you start to appreciate these game.

RATING: 4
The outcome of this game is determined (not necessarily in order of magnitude) by 1)where you sit relative to the starting player, 2) where/when you place you home station, 3) what five cities you need to connect, and 4) at which point you wish to connect in with someone else's track.  As far as I can see it, only 2 and 4 are in your control, but both of those are still influenced heavily upon the other player's actions.  Very, very poor game.  But it does still hold value in that anyone can learn to play it, thus earning it the distinction of a great introduction to modern gaming.

The base game with 5 players is merely okay (rating of 6 in my book). With the expansion (that allows you to block routes) and 3 players the game is more cutthroat and skill-based. Also, the final map looks less linear and more interesting.

Any game I can play with my son (4) and my daugther (6), and have a great time, I give a Ten. Maybe when we all get older it may go to the shelf.  But if you play it more than 50 times and have fun everytime, it is worth it.  We have played about 30+ so far....  Still fun.

That game was supposed to be dull and a clone of Ticket to Ride : Wrong.  It's a fun game on it's own and the Vexation expansion makes it a competitive train game.  With the Vexation expansion, it becomes a very, very strategic game.

RATING: 9
To my mind, one of the best boardgames I've played.

The rules are extremely simple, but the combination of trying to persuade other players to unknowingly (or knowingly) build one's route, and so sometimes not wanting to do too much on one's own, and at the same time having to keep up with the very fast pace, provides an intriguing problem every single round.

There are very few boardgames which I want to play again almost every time I finish playing once.  This is one of them.  If I win, I want to win again.  If I lose, I can usually recall at least a few minor errors which may have made the difference, and so I want to play again to see if I can do better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quick little train route-building filler.  Easy to teach, allows for good strategy and planning, as well as good player interaction.  The Vexation mini expansion adds a nice, extra strategic element, but I don't agree that's it's required -- I enjoy the game either way.

Some of my workmates at a prior job played this game a lot. It was the office favorite. It has a reputation as a "filler" game, but it's a good one. 

Too many rounds follow this plot exactly: (1) People start building transportation networks and linking up. (2) All players' networks are now linked into one. (3) Two turns later, someone goes out.

RATING: 8
This is a subtly deep game. If you're just trying to play it for efficiency, there's no game here. It's trivial to find out the cheapest network that will connect all your cities.

The challenge is trying to figure out what parts of your network you can avoid building, because your opponents will build it for you. You also try not to build too much of theirs for them, and to not give away where you're going so that they believe they'll probably have to do it for themselves (and for you at the same time).

It's sort of fun, but as I've played more, there's less to it every time. It's simply too simple for my tastes. If you want brainless entertainment, why not. I would play better games (Carcassonne or Africa, for example) even with non-gamers.

Indifferent.

An extremely simple game that's grown on me through repeated plays. Supports 5-6 players very well, but still plays well with three. Seems like there's some of luck-of-the-draw involved, yet careful play can overcome it. Your choice of starting point is subtle, and crucial.

Update: finally tried it with the [i]Vexation[/i] expansion: fun, but not enough to raise my rating of 6. [21 plays]

RATING: 7
In spite of all the jokes about the movie Transamerica when I bring the game out, it's a lighthearted game that moves quickly and allows a player to experience the high of winning a round without necessarily winning the entire game.  My wife likes it enough that she's been putting out hints that she wants TransEuropa for Christmas.

Update 9/06:  Our oldest (8) has taken a liking to the game, and if she can't sleep and her younger brother and sister are asleep, we'll let her come down to play a round or two and then send her back up to bed.

(EDIT: Aug 22, 2007): While Frank LaTerra calls TA an "activity" rather than a game, I still do like it a bit.  Don't get me wrong, I do see his point in that the only real decision making is in the initial starting position, but for some reason, that doesn't bother me too much.  Now, if this were a 1-2 hour game, I'd go bananas about that, but since it isn't, I don't mind so much.

A good, light train game that plays pretty quickly. If you're in for a quick, light game, I'd personally recommend it without the Vexation expansion (though reviews have said otherwise), as it extends the game and makes it somewhat aggravating (my friends and I who have played it with and without the expansion agree).

Well, it's short, I'll give it that.  Biggest complaint is that the more players you have, the more your fortunes are tied to how the other players' cards turned out rather than yours.  If you start in  the middle of the board, and have an opponent on either coast build toward you, you'll win every time.  So everybody should start in the middle, right?

Bought it because it is cheap and beautifull and may appeal to non-gamers.  Played only once: we added the rule that you may move your station after each turn to block other players.  This brings some tactics in the game which makes it more challenging and fun.  Still, level of control is very limited.  Overall, a light fun game.  Need more replays though to decide on final scoring.  For now: a score of 6,5.

Each player is dealt out five cities, seeded from different parts of the US. Play track to connect to your cities, and opponents can use your track to connect as well. First one to connect wins the round, scores are number of track missed relative to leader. Play over several rounds until one player hits a certain level. Fun, easy and light. I understand the variant where your rail line is proprietary to you adds more to the game.

It is a very nice and quick connection game that feels like playing some trick-taking game or something. Many short rounds. I don't understand the comparison to Ticket to Ride that a lot of people make. They are fundamentally different. In Transamerica, all railroads are communal and that make the game interactive in subtle way. I much prefer transamerica to overrated and not-so-good TTR saga. (in general, I like communal railroad games such as TA, SF, 18xx, SR but dislike non-communal ones such as TTR, AoS)

I remember not liking this game initially just like other Delonge's games. However, it started to become interesting (with some experience at BSW).

RATING: 7
A very light game.  I think I'd get bored with this one if I played it regularly, as there doesn't seem to be much strategy.  However, it is attractively produced and would definitely be a good choice for more casual players.

It's very good at what it does, though -- a quick, light connection game with ultra-simple rules that's a great choice when introducing a sceptical non-gamer to try something out.  For this reason, I've upped my rating from 6 to 7, and purchased a copy (2007-05-14).

RATING: 6.5
I initially despised it for being too light and too random. I still think it's light and random, but the games are short and I'm having fun playing it. There's a lot of tension into each game, because you don't know to what cities exactly your rivals are going, you don't know if you're helping them or not, you don't know when the game is going to end...

The rules are explained and understood in a couple of minutes and the games should not last more than half an hour.

I don't recommend to play it with 5-6 players though, as people say. The downtime kills the tension and the game becomes too random.

Played one game with 6 players. Very light. Moves you can make are pretty obvious. Not much to think, and not much fun either.

RATING: 6
Quick, replayable and not too demanding - effective family game in which several cities spread across the US have to be connected by railway. The thrill comes from the fact that when the railway lines of two players meet, they merge onto one big network which both players can build upon; especially for two players it's important to time the advances well, since many rounds are won with an edge of just one move.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Pleasing enough fare, but it's too easy to get the impression that you lack any sort of control - particularly when playing with large numbers. Satisfactory enough to kill time or take to the family for Christmas.

Further Thoughts: It might be my imagination, but there's a rather pleasant incipient meta-gaming strategy growing out of this one. Plus, there's still a tenseness which is completely lost on the Euro board.

[b]TransAmerica + Vexation[/b] was sold via the marketplace 4/1/16.

[i]Transamerica is a very light game which I don't mind, but the race element killed it for me. Basically it is a race to get your cities connected by one rail line. As soon as you connect your rail line to someone else's you can now both use that line, which leads to a lot of routes being finished once the connection is made which is not satisfying to me at all. We added in vexation, but even laying a track only you can use merely ends up being a temporary set back. I'm not saying the game is a luck fest, but I'm not interested in figuring out how to optimize my route placement so that it is less beneficial to other people, it's just not that interesting to me. I'm glad I tried this, but it'll be leaving my collection asap.[/i]

"Transamerica" is a good family game, with lots more strategy than first appears. It's easy to learn and teach, from ages 7 up, I'd say. And, it's very accessible, even for non-gamers. 

"Transamerica" caught on quickly with my family--not an easy task. It so easy to play that I think of it as a social game, even though one might rather spend his or her time thinking about the next move rather than chit-chatting. And, it's much better with multiple players than with only two. 

I'm most impressed by how simple its design is, yet it's rich tactically. Due to its relative simplicity, it's a game generally to be played several times in a row and then not played for a while. But it's one that we invariably come back to. My son Trevor, who was 10 years old in 2009, rated this game a "7.5".

An okay game, perhaps better played once as a filler than played many times in a row as per the rules.

Vexation greatly improves the game. Without it you can (brainlessly) play on auto-pilot, with it, you have some ammunition to cause problems for your opponents, and decisions about when to use them, hence I rate this a 5 and TransEuropa a 7, even though I prefer the US map.

12/28/11 - I have heard this was a simple train game and it's true, it is very simple. In fact I found it way too simple and outside of families, I could not see a gamer enjoying the game. They added a variant with colored tracks to block out others from piggybacking, but it usually only stopped them for a turn as they lay track around the block.

I think the Ticket to Ride series scratches my itch for a simpler train game and a little more strategy. I would play it from time to time but I would never suggest or request it. It gets a 5 for now.

Argg, this is now losing points every time I play it. Its not a game, its an activity.

I picked this one up after hearing the Dice Tower disagreement about it. 

This is a nice simple game that can be played with young children. I recommend using the Vexation pieces that come in the package to add some choices and strategy. I also use a house rule where the negative scoring is one point per city missed at the end of each round, instead of one point per each missing link. That softens the heartbreak each round, at the cost of almost never being able to actually complete a full 10-point game.

I haven't yet tried the solo variant, but it looks interesting...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
(The rating is only with the expansion, without it it's 4). 
For being a filler (I consider it a filler at least) it's rather good. I really won't play the game without the expansion which adds some personal tracks for everyone. 
The usual consensus seems to be that everybody have the worst possible locations in their cards.

Fun, very fast game. 2 players can play one round in less than 10 minutes, and a complete game of several rounds in less than 30.  Very simple to learn -- there are just 2 rules -- and interesting to play. Connect cities by playing one or two track pieces on the board each turn, and when you connect with another player's track you can build off their track, too -- that's the extent of the rules. The additional "Vexation" pieces add a little extra strategy.  Great, fast game!

So what is the matter with luck?  As long as the mechanism is pleasing, and you have the opportunity for some tactical decision making, it should be a fine game.  As Transamerica is.

Simple?  Yes.  Luck-based?  Yup.  Fun?  Yup!  The attempt to create the most efficient line is tricky, and sometimes you're stuck, but I like this little game.  There's something about manipulating other people's tracks that I enjoy (It's similar to my love of 6 Nimmt!, where you work the odds and play according to what you suspect your opponents will do).  All that said, when it lasts longer than 3 rounds I start to get edgy.

Simple, quick filler game of laying rails to connect cities, although is nothing like playing Ticket to Ride - this feels more like a multi-player puzzle, and can be quite addictive.

NOTE: Vexation expansion makes this a bit more interesting & cut-throat!

NOTE: This is better than the TransEuropa edition. The cards have little maps showing the location of destinations. The board is better balanced.

I own no game with simpler rules than this one, and yet it's no fluffy card game - but a real board game that rewards strategic thinking. Lots of luck, but that's mainly in the cards that are dealt. After that, it's real decisions.

Made better with the vexation expansion, which is just three sticks per color - I use union pacific trains for that.

Simplistic, yes, but it works very well.

RATING: 9
As Expedition is thoroughly enjoyed in our household, it was inevitable that feelings would be the same with this Expedition-lite design. As there is no subgame of collecting vouchers here makes this the ideal pacier substitute with four players. There is placement speculation as to what are the odds of trackwork near your destinations being built by your opponents so that you can lay track quicker to your target cities.

Egy rendkívül egyszerű szabályú játék. A lényeg, hogy mindenki húz 5 várost, ahova el kell érni a vasúthálózatával.
A hálózatokat össze lehet kötni.
Akinek először sikerül megtenni, az nyeri a kört. A különleges az, hogy nem a győztes van díjazva, hanem a "legyőzőttek" vannak büntetve, azaz annyi pontot kapnak, ahány szakasz hiányzik nekik a maradék városok bekötésére.
A játék addig megy, amíg valaki meg nem szerez 12 pontot.

Too simple. Light even for a gateway, I would much prefer using Settlers or Carcassonne as a gateway.

If there is more to this game I am missing it.

On its base TransAmerica is a little bland.  It is all about trying to get other people to do most of the heavy lifting for you.  It's not bad but doesn't offer to much challenge.  Throw in the Vexation expansion and you have a whole new game that requires considerably more thought and strategy.  You can add 1-1.5 points to my score if you play with Vexation.

I haven't played this with the Vexation expansion, and suspect that it would vastly improve the depth of the game... but even without, I like the simplicity and quickness this offers.  Once you've played a bit, it feels like playing a classic card game... say poker, or hearts... you don't have to think much, you deal with what you've got almost on a programmed basis, yet you still enjoy playing.

RATING: 7
Another train game. I found it quite fun for a filler, although it is way too solvable, especially for experienced players, there is always a "best" way to go , you only have to know which, but once you do, the game plays very linear and stagnant. The theme is very thin and I have seen train games which encompass the homely "feeling" of trains and tracks way better. A few more random elements, turn options and abilities to influence other players' moves and decision.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
TransAmerica is an okay game. You get a couple of cards, one per color, and on the cards there are city. The color represends a region on the map.
On your turn you place track on the map and as soon as your network is connected to a different player. You may use and extend the combined network. As soon as you are connected to all cities on your cards, you win the round.
It is fun playing and for winning a bit luck with card drawing helps.

Ticket to Ride light. Good for kids (that's what my rating is aimed at) by having easier-to-locate cities, and no hand/color management needed. I don't see how this is a game for adults, though.
For non-gamers and kids, this could easily be a 8.5, pushing a 9.

RATING: 8.5
A very simple and quick track laying game. I like that once you join up with another player you can then build off of their tracks.

Played a 3 player game using the "Nuke a city" varient. It has an interesting feel to it, but then it made it so that there was only one other city not used in that color. I think I would rather have more guess at where people are. Also seems that its almost worthless to choose a green or orange.

TransAmerica reminds me of Chinese Checkers: The Train Version.  I don't like chinese checkers, but somehow I do like TransAmerica.  I like the challenge of connecting my railroad to my opponent's and then using his route faster and better than he does.  It's neat.  

But sometimes there is too much difference in the random cities that each player builds to.  Sometimes one player is given a huge advantage over the other based on the cities that he/she must connect.  I don't appreciate that aspect of TransAmerica.

This is a great starter game for non-gamers.  It reminds me of Ticket to Ride, but with simpler mechanics.  It's too bad this game really doesn't work with 2 people - it all depends on the luck of the draw.  But just adding one more person makes it enjoyable.  This is really best with ~4-5 people

The game is decided 99,9% based on the initial draw. Quick playing but just pointless game with little decision making involved. You could basically show the cards and see who wins each round.

Okay, there is a little more skill than Snakes & Ladders, but not much.

The initial thrill is realizing that there IS strategy to the game.  It doesn't seem possible--the rules are basically "draw a line through points A, B, C, D, and E on a blank map, no one will try to stop you."  Once you see that the strategy is getting your opponents to draw part of your line, then the fun comes in watching their moves and smiling inwardly when they help you achieve your goal.  Turns are super quick, rounds are always surprisingly close and tense. A simple game that absolutely will not intimidate any non-gamers and will provide genuine german game-style fun.

I like this quite a lot.  It is, whatever some may say, completely different from Ticket to Ride.  Here's the proof:  If you split Empire Builder into two unique halves, one would be TtR, one would be TA.  Other than the theme, and the fact that you have hidden agenda cards, there is no overlap between the two.  Sure, I like TtR a little more, but I'm glad I have both.

Great, simple and fast game that works great as a filler. Length of gameplay (30 minutes) is the same regardless of the number of players. I don't like the rule where the "wall" moves closer to the furthest advanced train, since it seems to screw the person that already isn't doing well, giving them even less time to recover. The good news is that the game works great if you just ignore this rule.

"The simplest possible railroad game" as my friend Matt says... railroad gaming boiled down to its essence.

--Apr2010-- And then up to 7.3 in the Great Rerating.  It's a peculiar case:  simple game where the strategy seems obvious; but yet some folk (not me!) win far more than their share.

There aren't really any decisions to make here.  The winner will be the player whose routes most closely match others, so he can get other people to build track for him.  It does seem to be acceptable fare for getting non-gamers to the table, but I don't really enjoy the time spent playing.  At least it ends quickly.

This game can be recomended for six players.  Short waiting between turns and quick flow of play.  Players try to connect five cities within a rail network.  At the beggining everybody has his/her own one, but when they grow, they unify into one big network.  So, you have to think not only to get the best of your moves, but to get the best of the other players' moves.

This game is nothing more than a simple racing game that lasts just a few minutes long. In fact, the game is so short that the rules make you repeat the game 5 or 6 times until the game is declared over... just to extend the length of the game. This game is about as much fun as racing a friend of yours around the outdoor track on the field. No brains required, but it is a fun for a few minutes!

This is about as easy to explain and play as a train game gets. No stocks, no separate trains or tracks, no making of card sets, just five target cities and some layout and connection decisions. The components are pleasant. The game is quick. Not super deep, but there is a certain challenge in dividing your attentions in such a way that you benefit from the track-laying of others. A nice light train game.

UPDATE Jun-27-2010:
Played a lot versus AI via TransSib app. Dropping rating a fraction. While there is some strategy to "getting others to do your work," it's just not that deep. However it's also super fast to play and teach, so its lack of depth is forgivable -- but I'd like a bit more, please sir, may I have some more, sir. Rating may drop further, we shall see!

This one seems to be all about getting other people to do as much of your work for you as possible, and blocking the other players from taking advantage of the routes you're building.

Light strategy, quick turns and high player count make this an excellent group game.

TransAmerica is a very simple yet suspensful train game. There is luck in the ticket distribution, but good strategic play will be rewarded. For a more involved experience, check out any version of Ticket to Ride.

Light and fun, but more an activity rather than a game.  I've played it consistantly on BSW since it went up there, but never enjoyed it face to face.  

There are many better games out there, but not as many that are as accessable by newbies.  

My feeling is that this could be a great game, but I've got some serious issues with the end game. The game scoring system revolves around atrophy. Everytime someone beats you to the punch you lose the points that it would take to connect all the cities. The game ends when one player loses all their points. Fair enough, it works most of the time, but if you get a seriously bad round, you will end up with only a couple points.  At that point the game will very likely end before every other player has less points than you, so you will most likely lose, yet you must continue playing.  More often than not (50%) at least one player is forced to play out the game knowing full well they will never win.  

Certainly not be a must own, but will be revisited from time to time as a diversion.

Very simple elegant design. There's a lot less luck than it seems, but you have to think of the track laying as incentive manipulation, and the key is knowing where to place your initial piece, which is by far the most important decision of the game. It's rarely ideal when a game's most challenging decision is at the beginning, but TransAmerica is short enough and plays out over several rounds, so it's not as much of a problem. In many ways, this game reminds me of 6 nimmt! Play with the expansion. The game is meaner and more interesting that way.

Several plays, mostly on BSW

This is a simple network-building, connection game. Players start with 13 points. Each player gets 5 semi-random (1 from each of 5 groups) city cards. In turn order, place your starting marker. On your turn, lay 1 or 2 tracks (the map is a hex grid; hex sides have 1 or 2 lines, and you can cover 2 lines on your turn) that are contiguous with your start marker. If you connect to another track network, you can build off of it as well -- all track markers are simple black sticks. The first player to connect all their cities ends the round -- others lose points for each track they still need to lay to connect. After 2 rounds, you move the end-game marker to 2 spaces ahead of whoever has the fewest points; the game ends when someone crashes through that barrier. The player with the most points remaining wins!

The Vexation expansion gives each player 3 player-specific sticks; when used, they only count as track for the owning player.

You need to build efficiently, hoping that everyone else will build the track you need so you don't have to waste your own build turns doing so. Game play is quick, and this is not a bad gateway-type game. It's just not terribly exciting! The Vexation expansion, however, does kick it up a notch.

This game is simpler than Ticket to Ride, but similar in style (try to connect cities with railroads).

In my mind, this is the OTHER train game (Ticket to Ride being THE train game). This is a much faster train game, and requires much less thought. I like placing my starting city last or near the end, even though it puts me at a disadvantage in terms of finishing first. When I'm last, I'll usually place my city away from everyone else, let all the other people make connections for me, while I focus on myself, hopefully not aiding others too much. Some people prefer to be in the middle of the board in our group. Either way, there's still some chance involved, and, let's face it: you KNOW with some cards that you're just trying to avoid getting destroyed, like when you have cities in the four corners of the country.

Usually requested by family it is a very light substitute for ticket to ride. 

Instead of coloured train cards you are able to lay two rail pieces (one over mountains or rivers) per turn to a rail that is connected to your start token.

Plenty of strategy in initial placement of your meeple, after that, well, not so much, no.  Would be great as a computer game, since it could just calculate who wins after the initial placement, leaving you more time to play other games.

RATING: 5.5
A fairly enjoyable little filler.  That about sums it up.  The game is wonderfully easy to learn, takes very little time to set up and play, and comes in a sensibly small box with nice, functional components.  As an added bonus, it can be played with 2-6 players, although it seems to be a little less interesting on the lowest end of that spectrum.  So what's the down side?  Well, the game is rather heavily luck-dependent, but that is mitigated slightly by the fact that it is played over a few rounds, with the situation changing entirely from round to round.   Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

This is a game that was played a lot when it first came out back in 2001.  After a number of plays, my rating for this game went down to the current value.  It's an okay filler (10-20 minutes), but it's not a deep game.  There is not a whole lot of strategy here.

[Based on several plays both in person and online] Really is a very good filler game.  It is quick, easy, to learn and does have some interesting level of descisions to make.

As a game I think it's pretty clever, but luck of the draw is a pretty huge factor but since the game is short, the luck factor is fine with me. I enjoyed playing and can see playing it more in the future due it's filler nature.  I'd also consider the game more of a time filler in that I'm not sure there is a lot to think about and I'm not sold that winning and losing has much to do with you decisions.

Surprised I enjoyed this light game. Its an abstract with a tacked on rail theme. Its quick and light, but still fun. Honestly, probably best with 5-6. I wouldn't play this with less I think. Each round a player gets a set of cities to connect. Each turn, players place two tracks to try and connect it all. When someone completes, the rest lose points for the number of tracks they didn't finish. Winner is the player that has the round in which a player finally loses all their points.

Quick game where drafting on your fellow players' moves makes all the difference.  I haven't played with the Vexation expansion yet, but imagine that it will be necessary to keep things fresh after a dozen plays.

This may be an even better gateway train game than Ticket to Ride, as the rules are simpler and the game play shorter.  So far, however, it hasn't shown the depth of play of TTR (not that TTR is that deep, either).

RATING: 8
[thing=2842][/thing] manages to be even simpler than [thing=9209][/thing] (there is only one action to be done in the player's turn), but, at the same time, it is also somewhat deeper and more strategic, as during the game, luck plays just a small part (the luck of other taking cities near the places you want to go), however the player can start and build were he wants, inside the connections limits.

Basically [thing=2842][/thing] plays like this: at first, everyone takes 5 cities cards, one for each color/region of the board. The objective of the player is to connect all these five cities before anyone else. To do this the player first choose a place in the board to start his connections. Then, every turn, he can place 2 connections on the board (or one, when crossing mountains or rivers, as these spots cost two connections). And the main thing of the game is: when your connection reaches that of another player, well, now you both share this bigger connection as your own, and can go from places starting from any point on the railway. So it is possible that, once you connect with another player, you immediately complete your objeticve, if the new connection already reaches the places you need.

In the moment a person connects his five cities, the round is over. Everyone that didn't fulfill his objective counts how many connections he would require to finish it - considering the smallest route and couting two for connections that passes over river or mountains. This number the player will lose in points, adjusting the marker (that starts in the 13th spot) accordingly. When a player reaches zero, the game is over, and the player with the most points left will be the winner! If no one reaches zero, a new round is played.

The current edition of [thing=2842][/thing] already comes with a small expansion - [thing=29432][/thing] - that adds color connections, three for each player color. The players can use these color connections whenever they want during their turn, putting it as a normal connection and by the normal rules, and the difference is that it "cuts" the connection for other players - they only share the connection up to the point of the color connections. This small addition makes for a much better and meaner game. We can't even consider playing [thing=2842][/thing] without them, as they seem so much like a integral part of the game. The expansion allows for some bastard moves, and even if I can see that playing with them with, say, small children, could be bad, for us, gamers, we won't let it in the box, using it even in our first game.

Overall, [thing=2842][/thing] is a great little game - quick to play, easy to teach and learn, has a pretty good sized box (the board is bigger than I expected by looking at the box) and the bits are well done (though nothing really great in the art department). Everyone that played it enjoyed, all favorable of [thing=2842][/thing] over [thing=9209][/thing], and not only, but in big part due to the nature of the game, in a series of rounds, as someone can have bad luck, but recover later, or win one or two rounds, and even if this person loses, it still has a feeling of some accomplishment. Greatly recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Try to connect your five specific cities by rail. You choose where you start, but can build off of others' rails once you connect to them.

If you just hand out the cities randomly, the game seems very luck-based. Cities in the corner are usually terrible. Good strategy "feels" pretty obvious (try to let others do your work if you think they're going to), and usually won't save you from a terrible draw. Players usually do approximately equally well if they have any clue what they're doing.

If you distribute the cities by drafting, say 7 Wonders style, this can be an interesting game all its own (though it may take nearly as long as the actual game).

...I've now tried this with an "If Wishes Were Fishes" style of card market too. Quite interesting. The main game becomes basically a scoring procedure, which is fine with me.

I feel like where you start your network is a hugely important decision that you make right at the beginning with no information other than rules of thumb. Not sure if this can be changed (so that you can place new track anywhere) without destroying what game there is.

This is a great game for 2 which allows for some 15 or 20 minutes of entertaining board game fun. It's not 'Ticket to Ride,' but it doesn't want to be. This is a great small game, when played occasionally, but the lack of additional features may make it a bit unappealing for continued play.

Light filler, but limited strategies available. Once both players learn to wait and let their opponent develop the common area of the network, it usually comes down to the final turn.

One of the simplest of its type, so we usually prefer more complexity.  Still, I like it.  Good for a starter.  Haven't tried the Vexation expansion yet, but would like to play more of this still. Did finally try Vexation and will never play without it again. It really makes simple sense.

More fun that I thought it would be. It's extremely easy to learn, which is always handy. Most people grasp it instantly. I am not yet certain that the cards you draw in TransAmerica don't influence your chances too much.

A very light game which is exceptionally easy to pick up and a lot of fun for the first few games. However, it has a *lot* of luck, with little you can do to compensate for an unlucky deal. Possibly the best game to start non-gamers with, though. Not a bad way for non-americans to learn some basic american geography!

Good little game that makes me reconsider my rating for Ticket to Ride.  Easy to learn, with fun decisions about where to create your own track, and where to piggy-back on the tracks of others.  Game ended after 2 rounds, about 12 mins total play time.

RATING: 5
Very easy, very fast.  It just seems to lack something.  However, I think it's an decent game to teach to new gamers. (Seems to have been replaced with Ticket to Ride in recent years.)  The expansion Vexation makes it worth another try, to be sure.

Game is a little short and somewhat uninspiring. Players taking turn to lay down tracks and you hope that your opponents try to lay down tracks that lead to your city or close to it. Certainly not the most exciting game in the world. I think Ticket to ride is a comparable alternative and certainly much more tension filled. not a very fun game

On a second and third play with more experienced players, it was a lot better and more fun. Turns were unbelievably quick. I think we finished three rounds in less than 20 minutes. Fast play is more exciting and cuts down on boredom. Love it!

Arguably the simplest crayon rails game ever made, only using sterotypical black Euro roads instead.  Great (if mindless) fun, especially during the "complain about how horrible your cities are" phase.  I think of it less as a "gateway" game and more as a game that can be successfully played with comitted non-gamers who will never be suckered into playing PR no matter how hard you try.

(Also, as a good BSW timewaster.)

Two of my most recent TA games have been using repurposed Settlers roads for the new Vexation expansion.  I'm not sure I'd ever prefer to play vanilla TA again.

It's quite possibly better than Ticket to Ride in that there is a lot of player interaction--you almost have to use others' rails in order to succeed and you need to do it while trying not to cop to the places you're trying to get to.  At the same time, game play is fast and just strategic enough to hold your interest on multiple playings.

RATING: 7.8
My opinion of this game is slowly going up with repeated plays.  At first, it felt like a game with little strategy at all - you just kind of tossed pieces at the board.  

The more you play, though, the more you realize that there's a lot of subtle strategy to it.  For example, if you have one city at the edge of the board and the rest are fairly central, start near that edge city then focus on connecting to the network others have built.  

Every time I play it, my appreciation goes up a little, although I'd still much rather play Ticket to Ride.

I didn't realize a train game could get much simpler than ticket to ride, but this certainly is.  It plays very fast.  Being taught the rules then playing a 4 player game lasting 3 rounds took 20 minutes or less.  I can't say its much of a competitive experience, however.  The other 3 players were familiar with the game, but I won all three rounds easily by ignoring the other players (there is no real way to block their progression, even if you figure out their intentions) and simply laying tracks in a straight line from one destination to another.  There are no real decisions to be made here.  Just build your track and hope for the best.

This is a fantastic light "filler" game.  It is trivial to explain and reasonably quick to get through a round.

I *think* I prefer it without the Vexation rules, but they are a nice diversion, too.

Having played this as a fallback at nearly every game night for the last few years, it's starting to get boring because there is a substantial luck element.  But trying to predict other players is always a challenge.

Simple railroad game, shorter and easier than Ticket to Ride, but much different game, easy to learn, and great for kids. Simple enough to be considered a filler game, to play in between intense games; yet if you play with the 'Vexation' expansion's colored tracks (which came included with my copy), there's a lot more strategy as you can place your three special tracks strategically to gain a tempo or two over your opponents.

RATING: 5
If this were pitched as a kids game-- going up against heavies like Gulo Gulo, I would give it an 8, or even a 9. I would play this with kids anytime. A little geography, some counting: hey let's subtract 3 from 9! Six: yay, move the engine! What is faster, a curvy route or straight route? Yes! Straight! This might sound sarcastic-- and I don't mean it to. I really think I would enjoy this again and again with a four or five year old, especialy if it could replace Candyland. And, I have to confess, when there were no other games to be had one night, I did find some simple pleasure here laying down the wood pieces and passing the time with some pleasant table talk. But, as comment after comment makes clear: this is no game-- unless we define "game" so broadly as to mean simply: "We alternate turns!"

The idea that this is a good game for non-gamers seems slightly off to me. It is like saying water is a good food for a vegetarian....

UPDATE: This comment was written without Vexation. I need to try it again with it to see if that makes it better.

So, so simple.  And yet, lots of decisions.  One of the few really easy to pick up games that really blew me away with how many strategic decisions it has.  Worlds better than [gameid=9209] as the best train game to play with non-gamers.  It takes no time to explain this, and it's brilliantly implemented to keep it simple and easy to remember.  It's not hard for anybody to grasp "Lay two tracks on your turn, or one track in difficult terrain."  This is the first game in a long time that is both satisfying to me and to nongamers.

Grace (daughter) got for Christmas '11.  This is her favourite game and never refuses when offered.  I like it as I always feel quite confident starting out, it always seems to strike me as easier than Ticket To Ride and yet I can often be the loser in this one too.  Grace seems to lull you into a false sense of security as she spends more time playing with the rails making you believe she's not concentrating which is even worse when she wins and I have been concentrating on it!!

Luck fest - With a bad draw of locations, there is no way to win even if you play perfectly - unless other players screw up, or just happen to go through your locations. Avoid.

This really is THE game to get absolute non-gamers into boardgames, but its just so uninteresting that I didn't flinch at the opportunity to trade this away for a game I actually wanted. I am the type that would rather introduce a newbie to a game that is still accessible but more engaging and profound, e.g. through the desert, so TA really serves no purpose in my collection. People who enjoy this game admit that the pleasure they get out of it is to "relax" while they think  about or do something else... I guess depends on what you are looking for in a game.

I want to rate this game higher, because it's easy to explain and to play, but it hardly seems like a game at all.  Each play of this game seemed to play out exactly the same each time.  I've only played with two, though, and I can see ways that the game would differ with more players.

I enjoy this one as a train game more than Ticket to Ride.  Gameplay isn't necessarily similar, but TransAmerica is a lot faster-paced. Scores are often pretty close each round, and everyone likes to keep playing to try to be just a little faster in the next round.

Great game for those new to Eurogaming. You can explain the rules in under five minutes, and almost see them catching on as the first round progresses.

Great game. Players have a set of hidden objective cities on a map of the USA, and there is a collective pool of tracks that we each use 2 of on our turn. The winner of the round declares when all their locations have been connected to end the round. Rounds continue until a single player misses out on a certain amount of tracks. As players can help each other unknowingly, there is a lot of deduction and a little bit of bluffing. Good, light, exciting and fun.

I’ve never played TransAmerica before mostly because it looks like a small abstract filler, yet it was a six player game that everyone else was interested in so I happily went along with it and was pleasantly surprised by the game here.

The gist is you have five American cities you need to connect and you start with twelve points. All of the cities are connected by a triangular grid and you have a starting point somewhere on the board. On your turn you place two rail road pieces along the triangular grid. The first person to connect their cities ends the round and everyone else loses points based on how far they are from their goals. You play multiple rounds until someone hits zero points.

I’m pretty sure this is out of print and while I did enjoy it, I definitely wouldn’t recommend going out of your way to find it. However, if you can try it out, I do recommend giving it a shot.

I've played this once -- my rating might go up or down with future plays.

A good aspect of the game is drawing a random city in each of 5 different geographic regions in the United States.  This makes sure that everyone has to join up cities from all across the country, and doesn't reward someone for luckily drawing 5 cities from the same corner of the nation.

This is a fun, fairly quick game that's easy to teach.  I recommend it highly.

Middling light train game that simplifies the already simple Ticket to Ride. Less cutthroat, as you join in on existing routes, but it's quite plain.

Rail game where all track is common and you try to connect your cities first.  One of my favorite short games.
Another game with very simple mechanics but plenty of thought into your turn.  Cards may be good or bad depending on what cards everyone else has.  I think it is best with six.

Fun, light game.  Although luck plays a large role, I have seen skillful play win most games so far.  I try to picture the transcontinental connections form based on the initial player locations.  Very enjoyable.

Although we do enjoy playing this game with our son, we haven&#039;t yet found that subtle strategy we&#039;ve heard about.  Perhaps we need to play it a few more times with the adults only.  But my 8 yo son loves this game, it&#039;s quick, it does take some planning, and heck, he&#039;s building a railroad.

Played a few times face-to-face and several times on BSW (with 2 to 6 players). An interesting shared network game which plays rather quickly, and yet is deeper than it may seem at first. My main concerns are the possible lack of balance of the objectives and the possibly frustrating end game condition.

This one is super easy to teach, plays really quickly, and is extremely simple while still providing a decent amount of strategy - perfect for playing with family and/or entry-level gamers.


Vexation is a great addition, and if your version didn't include it you can always borrow a few road pieces from Settlers.

RATING: 5
A train game even more basic than Ticket to Ride. TransAmerica is so light it could blow away in a sudden breeze. A complete game is made up of several identical rounds, presumably to beef things up into something worth taking the time to get out of the box. There's nothing to it, so I wouldn't actively choose to play it, but it's inoffensive, so I wouldn't mind if I ended up playing. Perhaps the Vexation expansion improves things?

I bought the Trans Europa after playing this game at a frinds house. Both games are light, fun and easily explainable to non-gamers. Not necessarily a gateway product into the Ticket To Ride series, these games work well with kids.

RATING: 8
Great little game of skill, luck and American geography.

Out of 5...
1 in complexity.  More rules than Snakes and Ladders, but not by much.  I've not met anyone who's though TA too hard to learn.
2 in choice.  I find this a hard one to rate, but I'd say that randomly-allocated stations coupled with a high dependence on other players drags the amount of player control down a lot.
5 for conversation.  The game revolves around utilising your opponents' moves, while light rules and fair down-time tend to allow players the chance for off-board chat as well as on-board interaction.

Not as much luck as most people think (you can number your way through the distances, but the math behind which way to build isn't easy at all).  There is a science to getting people to build your route without building theirs.  Also the groupthink of the other players is critical.

The Zen train game. Everybody is laying train track in order to connect five different cities. All track is the same, so as soon as you connect to somebody elses track, it counts as yours too. 
Allthough I see hardly any room for strategy in this game, I get beaten by the same players over and over again.

I've only played with the expansion to the game which to me seems like it adds a lot to the game play in that it makes things a little bit more competitive.  I don't think I would enjoy the base game alone as much though it would be simpler and more friendly.

Just recently bought this game as a thought for Thanksgiving.  My wife not only enjoyed it, but showed interest in other similar games.  The simple rules and quickness have charmed her the way no other game has to date.  Anything that will make my completely non-gaming wife yearn for another game is fantastic in my book.  It gets more complex and fun with more players.  But is fun with just two.

{ P - 4 5 [6] }

Annoying short game you can play flawlessly and still have no real chance. Not quite imperative that your randomly selected cities are close to the other players' but it sure helps. Too many outliers in one round can ruin an entire game for someone. Six players helps reduce the noise, and bypassing the Vexation expansions that allows people to have small sections of private track (which only shafts people who need cities in the same area, which is not each of that player's opponents, which simply adds more random shafting to a game that certainly didn't merit it) is also a good idea.

Strategy flies out the window halfway through each phase as everyone jumps on others' track. Visually appealing, simple rules, but ultimately lacks the compelling strategic decisions to be played more often by sophisticated gamers. A great hit, and rates around an 8.0, with a younger set.

RATING: 8
This game is almost entirely luck, so why is it so much fun? Maybe it's because tension develops as you wait to see whether your opponents will lay track in your direction. Anyway it's great for a warmup or to fill that last half hour before you get kicked out of the game store.

Very simple game and so light it almost floats. Constructing the network and seeing it expand across the map is kind of cute, but the decisions in this game are very obvious. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll play this with a group of gamers, but it might come of the shelf with non-gamers.

Update: I actually like it a bit better with 2 players.

I don't entirely agree with the negative reviews of "it all comes down to the cards you pick each round" argument.  I think it comes down more to how well (or poorly) you take advantage of rails that others have built; i.e., how efficient are you?  I dunno...I really like it as a game, or exercise, or whatever...I still have fun playing it.

I think this game is truly outstanding. This is the only game that my wife and daughter enjoy playing, since there is little or know conflict. At the same time, I really enjoy playing. The luck element is significant, but this is not all bad, since it means that more people will have the opportunity to win. My largest complaint about the game is the poor quality of the cards.

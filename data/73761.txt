RATING: 7
With only a few days left in our climbing expedition, over 7000 m high on the savage mountain, K2, my wife turned to me and said, "this really does feel like we're climbing a mountain." That was near the end of our first play of K2.

K2 is a board game from designer Adam Kaluza that is dripping with theme. My wife and I were already fans of his game The Cave, but I wasn't sure how K2 would play out. Keep in mind, I am an Everest and mountain climbing junkie, so the bar was already high. Even so, I was very pleasantly surprised.

The game plays quickly (about an hour) and definitely gets tense near the end when you are trying to summit the peak while living to tell the tale.

Tragically, in our first game one of my climbers died on the very last day after making the ascent and getting stuck over 8000 m.

My wife and I both liked it and we are happy to add it to our collection.

UPDATE 6-26-14: Bumped down to a 7. It's a nice, quick, solitaire, puzzley game but one that I've never played with more than 2 people and never more than one since our initial game.

UPDATE 7-29-14: Played again recently with my wife. I think 7 is a good rating for now. There is not a whole lot to this game but it does play quick.

RATING: 9
My ONLY concern with this title is replayability. I'm thinking that after a while, it can become rather mechanical which routes to take and how to go about taking them when considering the weather that's in play.

I like the game in that it REALLY FEELS like mountain climbing in the abstract. I feel for the danger involved, the need to manage the card hand properly, and the need to balance movement with health. It is a VERY interesting set of balancing acts that need to be performed all at the same time.

A frosty looking game that is tepid in delivery. There isn't alot to like about K2 beyond the rich theme and nice components. Love the art and vibe it emits, but as for play, it's just a bunch up and wait routine. It's is a race for certain, but the first to the top (with someway to not die) is all that this game is about. There aren't any difficult decisions which is ironic since in reality, claiming this would put you on edge every minute. Not looking to play this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I am a bit torn with this one. K2 has a nice theme and aspects of hand management and timing your pushes which are all things I like. On the other hand it feels a bit scripted and luck driven. The game is not of pure luck in the traditional sense, but when everyone is trying to reach the same goal with symmetric decks it ultimately comes back to the question who draws the correct cards at the time when they need them most. However, the game definitely is a fun challenge at least for a few times.

RATING: 8.5
One of the best presents I ever got for a non-gaming (but mountaineering friend) who spent all of the few games we've played marvelling at the game's ability to show some of the real life push and pull decisions mountaineers make. In particular the hard decision that after all of that we're not going to make it to the top, sorry team! Sets a premium on responsibility (you die you get score nothing for that team no matter how high up they got). The weather mechanism is fantastic, and the double sided board and alternate weather means you have 4 different settings right out of the box. Great value.

Read my review here:

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1418322/settlers-stavanger-reviews-k2

I like a lot of things about K2. I like the theme and think the mechanics work very well such as the mountain being more treacherous and harder to climb when the weather is bad. I like the hand management aspect and the fact that everybody has an identical deck and so has more-or-less even chances of winning. On that note, it's also possible for a climber to "sit-out" the push that everybody else is on at once and wait until they have better cards or better weather and still win the game because the other climbers pushed their luck. 

A very good game with a great theme and artwork.

K2 is a game light enough on rules to play with your family. In essence, you're simply playing cards and moving your climbers up or down the mountain. To this bare chassis Adam Kaluza has bolted several nicely thematic elements, like the mountain sapping more endurance as you climb higher, tents that offer some protection from that, and variable weather (though you have a six-turn forecast so there are no nasty surprises). Timing is key in making your bid for the summit and in deciding how long you dare block others' path to it.  I like that there are options for making the climb harder (a tougher board and/or weather), though since my climbers keep dying at the easy level it may be a while before I progress.

Rebel.pl has done a decent job of the artwork and the quality of the board, bits and cards is excellent.  However, I've had some difficulty differentiating the blue player's set of cards from the green in less than optimal light.

A surprise hit for me.  Nowhere near as complex as I had assumed, this is a thematically rich and consistent climbing, push your luck, hand management game that is thematically rich.  Quick turns, just enough luck to foil or help your planning - cheers as climbers reach the summit but keeping them alive for the descent is the hard part).  Lovely artwork, good pieces, simple mechanisms - this is a nice, light-medium, thematic game that is definitely fun to play.

RATING: 5
The theme is great and the mechanics quite support it. The end game needs a small house rule to be interesting and to avoid unthematic "camping on the summit" phenomenon. Luck of the draw can play a big part and order of play can be decisive (blocking can and will kill you). It's not very interesting with low player counts and shines with 4. Nice game, but somehow leaves me wanting a little bit more excitement and strategy for the duration it takes to play.

Played on Board Game Arena only. This game does it great job of capturing the tension and risk of actually climbing a dangerous mountain. Amazed at how such simple gameplay can lead to such tense, challenging decisions. Players must balance speed with acclimation and know when to push forward and when to play it safe based on the changing weather. Good amount of player interaction, jockeying for position on the mountain and trying to avoid the risk tokens.

The first few times I played with less than 4 players, and I think the intensity is not quite high enough at that player count. With at least 4 players, the mountain gets more clogged, and at that point the game seems to be the right balance of risk-taking and planning. When I finally started having very good games of it, it felt smart without being overwhelming. Use the winter weather at the very least. You'll know you're doing it right once you start feeling like your climber will die any minute.

Our game (summer, 3-players) completely locked up ~five turns from the end.  I was stuck in a tent two (?) spaces below the peak, but couldn't get all the way up and down again quickly due to being blocked.  In turn, I was blocking everyone else.  I managed to kill off two guys at the summit,  and thus won, but it was a most unsatisfactory way to win.  The main problem was the guy blocking me went after me in turn order, so he was always in the way.  And I guess I had no particular incentive to move out of my safe warm tent....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An enjoyable thematic game, if slightly underwhelming. I think I would prefer if the game included a cooperative aspect and was more random to bring more variety. I would definitely suggest playing on the "hard" map and getting the avalanche tiles so the distribution of weather tiles is not determined in advance.

A decent game with some outguessing your opponents. In the end, though, its mechanics are just too light to keep it interesting for as long as it takes. A decent game I'd gladly play once in a while, but definitely not one I love.

Jól eltalált, könnyed játék. Két hegymászónknak minél magasabbra kell jutnia, az általuk a játék folyamán elért legnagyobb magasság számít (a két érték összeadódik), de csak életben maradók eredményeit vesszük figyelembe. Sokszor muszáj visszaereszkedni a magasból, mert különben életveszélybe kerülnek. Taktikázós játék, helyenként egymást akadályozhatjuk benne, kivárásra is játszhatunk. Elég nagy a szerencsefaktor.

This game, while a pure Euro, is quite thematic: the mechanics and the gorgeous components add up to give the players a strong alpinist feeling, and the end game is very tense, with agonizing life or death decisions.
K2 is light, almost a family game, but is challenging and fun enough to be a good ride for gamers.
There's multiple difficulty levels, so it can be set to the players' skills, although I wonder if it can sustain repeated plays: there's a limited amount of interaction (some kind of "blocking") between the players, so it's a game of planning and efficiency and could be somewhat repetitive...

RATING: 7
Easy to pick up and play with non-gamers. The game strikes a nice balance where, even if a mountaineer dies, it ends up being a source of laughter as opposed to a negative experience.

After playing a few times, there are some ambiguities in the English rule book that are pretty glaring (e.g., it never tells you what to do with risk tokens past the round they were initially drawn). It's just another game in the long list that has flawed writing.

Edit: March 2017. This is a keeper. I would recommend this to any one looking for an entry level game with an interesting theme and some depth of gameplay. It's one of my "gateway" weight games of choice.

Game does a surprisingly good job in capturing the risky feel of mountaineering while only using very simple mechanics. But while the rules and mechanics are pretty straightforward, the gameplay is still challenging. The game is about planning and timing and a bit of risk management. There is also a blocking component I'm not yet sure I like. While it could be another aspect to take into account when aiming for the top, it seems to come down to luck who's first in turn order when the opportunity to reach the top is presented. Maybe turn order could be determined by the number of moves minus the number of acclimitisation a player plays. This way players would have more influence on turn order while being punished for a high bid with risk tokens.

Have been playing my last few games using a variant that determines turn order according to the number of moves played. This has been working like a charm and has made the game much more interesting.

Simple mechanics make this more suitable for family fun.  One family member who is more analytical and competitve found it too simple.  

As a solo exercise, with just one set of climbers, it's a good time filler, but not a terribly immersive experience.  Playing multiple teams solo tends to drag, but does have more interesting choices as blocking another team is an interesting tactic.

Played on easy which was way too easy for gamers. This just turned into a game of "grab the top and sit there", blocking off everyone else.

Would probably present a better game at a more challenging level. However, also not sure I would introduce this to the family. Somehow it seems a little to unforgiving for a family game.

I just can’t seem to get where all this hype about K2 comes from, for it looks to me like a decent game but nothing more: it’s likely that it properly reproduces the risks and difficulties of an extreme climb as the alpinists say but still all I feel I want to do in K2 is to pitch my tents and wait for the play to end.

Yet, even though the game as a whole can hardly win me over (it still feels too euro for my taste), I like how the theme was developed, for I see it was carefully worked out within the game and not just stuck on afterwards: actually while playing you feel like you’re really fighting the mountain in your attempt to reach the top and you know that a misstep or even an unexpected event can be deadly.

This is something I like but sadly not enough to feel compelled to play K2 too often.

Edit: After more plays, in December 2011 I’ve resolved K2’s so dripping with theme it deserves a better rating, thus raised it from 5.5 to a full 6. Further adjustments are not to be excluded.

Purchased it during a sale on a whim.  Pleasantly surprised by how fun this game it.  One of the few games that I'll play solo when the mood arises. 

Give it a few games before you decide whether you like it or not.  The first game for us was kind of "meh."  By the end of the 3rd or 4th game we loved it.

Love how it can appear that someone is far FAR ahead of everyone else, then the weather changes and their climber meeple dies, leaving them in last place. Outstanding game!

What a great surprise!! I was expecting a good game not a great game. Its very thematic and really feels like your climbing a mountain. The mechanics remind me of Ave Caesar but with more to think about. As you approach the summit a push your luck element come into play where you need to decide whether to go for the glory and risk dying due to a poor card draw, or settle with seven points, start your decent, and hope no one else can get to the top either. All that being said, it still is a light game with a fair amount of luck and I'm sure it will be a hit with the family. Now we just need North American availability.

A push your luck game with elements of hand management and good opportunities to block other players, either on their way up the mountain or their way back down.

The higher you get up the mountin the more inhospitable it is, the harder it is to move and the more health you lose, so sometimes you have to judge when to quit and head back down the mountain to stay alive.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play against seasoned gamers (The winter version on the hard map)  In this game it's a race to the top of the mountain managing movement points, acclimatization levels and guessing your opponent's moves. When reaching the top it gets more and more crowded. Gameplay reminded me of Flamme Rouge, altough that game has slightly simpler rules.

There's a bit of luck involved, but you influence chance by managing action cards and factoring in the weather events and risk tokens to come. This game is very thematically linked to the mechanics and playing on the winter level certainly makes climbing feel like a survival.

The greatest thing the game manages is creating tension. Because the resources are so tight it's almost certain one (or both)  of your climbers will perish. And there's no victory for frozen meeples.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Easy to learn, fun with even non-gamers. You get really the feeling of dread when you don't manage your cards well and you just try to have your climbers survive the mountain. The levels of difficulty add extra challenges for the players, which is very nice.

RATING: 7.5
Good mathsy euro-like, that has some very punishing rules in it. You miscalculate - you ... die. In this game this is a great plus, because it fits thematically and isn't unfair at all. You need to do some good risk/reward calculations and will be rewarded for it. Also: What others do is very important for you, so you'll closely watch every step the other players do. You can also kill other players by blocking their retreat stops, so K2 isn't your typical Euro ;-).

Feels very good, when you make it to the top and bring back your courageous mountaineer to safety.

RATING: 3
Provisional rating, but I was so underwhelmed I'm really unlikely to play again to update my rating.

We played the 'hard' side with the advanced weather (if that's the right terms) and I didn't experience any of the 'tension' that others have playing this game. There is little interaction other than 'blocking' (maybe this is thematic, I'm not a mountain climber) ... The decisions are optimising your 3 cards each turn from 6, and I suppose you could track your cards, track others cards and analyse it for optimum play, but I really couldn't be bothered - it was dull.

I didn't feel I was climbing a mountain, I was playing cards, moving markers on a record board (to see if my dudes died) and meeples on the map. 

Biggest annoyance though was the risk tokens - reveal 3 and player who plays the most movement takes one ... missed opportunity there, either have them all and take in reverse movement order (so pushing ahead you get the bad chits) or some other reveal mechanic based on weather. 

Overall for the weight of the game it was too long and fiddly. For a race game there are many more I'd play (for simple - Ave Caesar, for fun/experience either Turfmaster, SnowTails or Mississipi Queen).

Es un juego de escaladores. Cada jugador maneja un equipo de dos escaladores. En cada turno hay varias fases. Primero se escogen 3 de 6 cartas robadas al efecto (las siguientes 3 se usan junto a otras 3 en el turno siguiente), después se realizan acciones que permitan las cartas (movimiento, montar casetas, aclimatarse) y después se aplica el desgaste por la montaña y por el clima. Cada escalador tiene un marcador de "salud" que se debe mantener en positivo para evitar que el escalador muera.  A medida que vas ascendiendo por la montaña vas mejorando la puntuación. Es un juego sencillo y rápido de explicar. Las ubicaciones en la montaña tienen capacidad limitada, por lo que se pueden dar bloqueos y tal.  Hay algo de puteo y conseguir coronar la montaña y mantener vivo al escalador es más dificil de lo que parece. Admite variante de invierno y verano que permiten regular la dificultad del juego.

K2 is a race game, where you score more points if you reach the summit before the other players, but only if your mountaineers survive. There are several interesting mechanics, such as weather and acclimatization, that contribute to create a very thematic experience. Unfortunately, I am indifferent to climbing and felt like the game dragged in the second half. Given 60 minutes, I'd rather play Snow Tails or Powerboats.

While nothing earth shattering, I thought that this game at least was very well done thematically, and had a few innovative ideas game-wise.  

With 4 players though, the middle of the map was not at all crowded, which meant that the only tension was at the top.  I think that it would be more tense and interesting on a higher difficulty level, so I'd like to try it that way next time.  

Initial rating a 7, although I can see this one going higher if it plays better on a more difficult setup.

This game is great - I can see why it was so sought after last Essen.  This is basically the best hand management game out there.  This is because your deck is knowable (you will come to be familiar with all the values and their frequency without busting your brain) and it cycles in a semi-predictable manner (there will be 2 reshuffles and that's it).  The mechanics are simple, but the choices can be agonizing, as it's life and death for your climbers, and one mistake can really tank the game for you - usually this involves getting to the summit and then realizing there is no way to get back down alive.  Ashar loves the theme, and so do I, and this is one of those rare games that nails the theme, does so simply, and provides plenty of reason to come back again and again.  Perhaps the best game of 2010?

This is both very thematic and nicely designed.  There are a number of factors to take account of each turn but it's not too complex and game moves along quickly as the various game elements all fit together well and support the theming to ensure you feel as though you're involved in a real battle with the elements.  

I can do no better than quote [url=http://bgg.cc/user/EYE%20of%20NiGHT] Eye of Night[/url]'s comments as I completely agree (with thanks to Jon for summing up my thoughts so well):

[i]"K2 fascinates me! It's a fixed board, you know your cards, you can see the weather days ahead, you know the turn order, and yet you keep having hard decisions to make. And the question is always, can I make the big push to the top and still get down before freezing to DEATH? Oh that DEATH, it hovers over you the whole time. In the early rounds, you are care-free, building your strength on the low slopes. Then you begin the ascent and still it's not too hard. But then, as you near the middle game, it just gets harder, as the climbers start jostling for position. if you don't move now, you'll miss your chance to climb. But the weather is turning bad and your tent is already built below you. Go forward, wait or go back?"[/i]

I've really enjoyed this, although the hard side of the board remains unconquered, even in summer weather - having turned back within sight of the peak to ensure I survived the last time we played I was determined to get there this time and did - but was caught in a snowstorm on the last leg of my retreat from the summit and perished in the blizzard (I had just enough movement to get below 8,000 feet where weather conditions were much better and I would have survived but was undone by being 'high bidder' and forced to take a risk counter which meant I couldn't escape my fate).  Tragic, but great stuff.

The easy side of the board is a lot easier, but can still be tough, even in summer weather.  Given that two players had already played their rescue cards to avoid freezing to detah at the summit, I was thrilled to get my second climber to the top on the second last turn.  I then built a tent there on my last turn and both my climbers survived on only 1 remaining point of conditioning - only for another player to get his second climber to the top on the last turn and win on the tie break - !!!

Clearly you need to plan out your attempt to hit the summit with the turn order rotation, the weather, and the position of the other players, however, that seems to be the entirety of the game.

It also felt a bit weird to have a player at 20 points, blocking the summit, and we have to hope the climber dies, but we can't do anything to make it more likely to happen.

Even though this game gets a lot of praise, we just didn't like it that much. It felt a little "limiting" in what you can do each turn and was not a really "rewarding" experience.

K2 is a very different game; the mechanics differ from any other games I can think of, even though it’s actually a very simple game. The race aspect of the game is what makes the game interesting along with the fact that you can block people off - especially with 5 players I would guess; have yet to try it, but I think it would be extremely chaotic in a good way! However, I still think that or or perhaps 4 players is the best number for me personally. As a 2 player game (or even solo) the game wasn’t that interesting.

The hand management was good though nothing spectacular as you basically run through your deck 3 times and that’s it. I loved how you are able to see the weather forecast a few rounds ahead, so you can plan after that and make the best possible moves (that is, unless your opponents block your way so you stay a long way up on the mountain and freeze to death).

It was perhaps a liiitle weird that it could pay off not to reach the summit as you would then face the risk of dying and hence only score 1 point instead of 10. So sometimes it might be better and just reach 5-6-7 points with both of your climbers. But overall the game felt unique, and though it’s not a game I would play all the time, I can see myself play it a few more times before eventually selling it off. Oh, one final thing I need to mention is that the game comes with four different difficulties, so you can always adjust the difficulty based on how many players you are or with whom you’re playing.

I really enjoyed this game. I like to feel immmersed in the game and this is what K2 does.  The theme fits with the mechanics and the artwork is neat.  As you climb, you must keep an eye on the weather and your oxygen level...sometimes you can climb too high, too fast and forget you oxygen level - you will pay the ultimate prize eventually. The mechanic of pulling & choosing your cards is simple, but allows you enough choice to decide over the fate of your climbers. While playing I noticed that there was more that could have been added to the game to enhance it even more: avalanches, falls, Nepalese guide, food etc... Another minus point is the fact that once my climber died a little over halfway through the game, the tension in the game resided very quickly and I walked at ease back to the camp. This had as consequence that the tension lessened for the other players too, because others started playing on safe and headed back too.

An exquisite example of a pure, minimalistic, utterly immersive design. Through a limited basic set of mechanisms, K2 manages to channel the exhilaration but also horror of mountain climbing. Fundamentally a resource allocation and hand management game with strong negative player interaction and a solid dosis of thematic variability in the form of weather. The game is highly replayable with just one map and minimal input variability, due to its tight design and player-induced variability. A staple of any gamer's collection. Highly recommended.

+ strategic as well as tactical in its approach
+ tense and inclusive of a solid decision/probability space
+ high variability and replayability

At first I thought that K2 was a bit too simplistic, but as the game went on I liked it quite a bit. It feels like a game of continuous risk-taking, but unlike so many push-your-luck games, you actually have some information to base your decisions on. The first game was rather easy, but I think it's because we all played the "easy" side in summer. I'm sure it really comes into its own with a few expansions. My only gripe is that at the highest levels, the game rewards the two climbers not being together (e.g. [top] and [top-2] gives fewer points than 2x[top-1]).

RATING: 8.1
Alterntive play (from BGG forums with some modifications):

1) Player order
In each turn, the player with the most movement points, (beside the usual risk-token) also gets the start-player marker.
In case of a tie all tied players draw risk-tokens until one has a higher total than the others. The winner keeps (and suffers) the cheapest of the drawn tokens.
So if 3 players all played 4 movement points, they each draw a risk-token. A+B draw 1's, C draws a 0.
C is out, A+B draws again, A draws a 1, B draws a 0. A wins and must keep one of the drawn 1's.

2) Teamwork
No player can seperate the two climber's more than one elevation zone.

3) End of Game
- After the final turn, but before scoring, do one final acclimatization phase (with no weather effects or acclimatization cards). If climbers survive, they score points, if not, then don’t.
- At the end of the game every player has to subtract 1 point for each altitute-level (left side of the board) that each mountaineer has to step down to the base-camp.
So if you have a mountaineer above 8.000 m he loses 3 points.
If you have a mountaineer between 7.000-8.000 m he loses 2 points.
If you have a mountaineer between 6.000-7.000 m he loses 1 point.
A mountaineer on a space below 6.000 m has nothing to subtract from the gained points.

4) Tent
For every unplaced tent, player recieves 1 point at the end of the game.

5) Exceed Space Limit
- Entering space:
Any number of climbers may exceed the space limit.
It costs +1/2/3/… movement point(s) and +1 acclimitization point for each climber in excess of the space limit.

When climbers start a turn in an overcrowded space, only the last climbers to move (those that exceed the limit) are required to pay +1 acclimatization point or leave.
Example: The space X is limited to 1 climber and normally requires 2 movement points to enter. It is currently empty and there are no additional movement costs due to the weather.
Player A enters the empty space for 2 movement points, as per normal.
Player B enters the space for 3 (2 + 1 excess) movement points and 1 acclimitization point.
Player C enters the space for 4 (2 + 2 excess) movement points and 1 acclimitization point.
Player A could add his second climber into the space for 5 (2 + 3 excess) movement points and 1 acclimitization point (if they have enough).

This might simulate each additional mountaineer, having to take an increasingly more difficult route, to get around the 'block'.

- Setting up a tent:
On the turn that a climber enters a space, the cost of setting up a tent is the same cost that a climber paid to enter into the space (it includes any additional movement cost due to exceeding the space limit, but no acclimatization point will be lost!).
In later turns if a climber stays and sets up a tent in an overcrowded space, the cost will be +1/2/3/… movement point(s) (beside the regular points) in excess of the space limit.
Example: The space X is limited to 1 climber and normally requires 2 movement points to enter. There are 2 climbers on the field and no additional movement costs due to the weather.
Player A stays and sets up a tent for 2 movement points, as per normal.
Player B stays and sets up a tent for 3 (2 + 1 excess) movement points.

RATING: 4
(Impression based on a short sample game.) I’ve read the accounts of the harshness of this mountain compared to the other 'eightthousanders'. Frankly I consider it far more of an achievement if a mountaineer climbs the K2 than if he climbs Everest. Everest is of course King of the Hill(s), so you want to be able to say you made it to the top there... but it's becoming more and more of a tourist attraction: not really special (even if it is still a dangerous and potentially lethal undertaking). The K2 now... That's something else entirely.

Unfortunately, the feeling of climbing one of the hardest and harshest mountains in the world does not enter this game particularly well. All you do is selecting cards from a hand of six which either give you movement points or healing points. The decks are personalised, but contain the same cards for everyone, and the game is so abstracted that you're only adding small numbers together. It does become more ‘difficult’ once you get ‘higher’, of course, but still it amounts to subtracting somewhat larger numbers. There is no personalisation in the decks in that different players prefer different 'styles' of climbing; there is no sense of imminent doom due to high altitude sickness or violent storms, only that you know that you're spooked because the proper numbers are already gone. The only strategic choice you make is where you place your tent, and whether you sacrifice one climber for the other. (Which is a rather perverse idea, to be honest.) Apart from that, waiting for the correct cards to appear from the deck, and hoping they do so before bad [-]numbers[/-]weather strikes, is all you do.

I should point out that I do not consider the game too easy: there is still a fair bit of number jockeying required of you before you summit and survive. My critique focuses on the fact that in the end there is little more to the game than adding numbers on cards and spaces together, and that this activity doesn't change as the game progresses. It is cute for a moment; it is not cute for the length the game takes. There should have been more diversion (more ways of number jockeying at least) to keep the players occupied and interested.

Additionally, I think that the numbers race is a simplistic way of representing the climb to the top. A co-op model would have worked much better here: the players start out as a group against an implacable enemy—the mountain—who cares not one iota for the well-being of the moutaineers. It's just there. The higher the mountaineers climb, the less their group holds together because it is every man and woman for himself at great altitude. To me that sounds far more interesting than what is currently offered. But I should be careful in putting my own ideas of what K2 ought to be before those of the author: he designed the game, after all. And although I can understand why he chose the mechanisms he did, I find them too simplistic to be fun for more than half an hour or so.

This game is quite fun and not as complicated, but - first part of the game - nothing happens, followed by race to the top (fun) and quite often in my game group followed by "blocking each other so others cannot move" (not fun). 

Components are OK. 

Re-playability is there, but not for everyone. One of my two game groups got tired of it after few plays. Second group liked it, but when I did not brought it to game night, they were not requesting it. Time to sell this.

This is a very immersive themed Euro. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it really felt like battling the dangers that an alpinist would encounter. Each player controls two climbers, because there is a pretty good chance one of them will die!

There's a hand management, risk control aspect to the game. Weather plays a role, but you have a few turns to prepare for each day's weather, so it's not totally out of one's control. 

Would be nice to see some avalanches in an expansion.

Update: And now there is an expansion with that exact title.

What I liked:
* Different to most other games I played
* Mechanics and gameplay work well
* Simple to teach and play

What I didn't like:
* If a skiier dies you are basically out of the game 
* found myself in a position where my action could choose who wins and who looses out of the other 2 players 3/4 of the way through the game making all turns pretty much useless for the rest of the game as I could not win so I stayed out of their way (which was pretty boring).

RATING: 9
Very good game of hand management and risk taking.
The player interaction isnt high (mostly jostling for space and avoiding the risk tokens), but its got great hand management, risk taking and tension. Planning out your assault based on what weather is predicted, then adapting based on card draws, risks and players that are in the way are presented really well and I found myself on the edge of my seat sweating out whether to take a greater risk to get to the top faster... should I hide in my tent before descending... great stuff.
I'm looking forward to more plays and hope the two boards, two sets of weather cards and varying card draws and risk tokens keep it fresh. Certainly there should be deliciously tough decisions to make every game.

This is really a marvellously designed game.  It almost feels like climbing the mountain - the theme is perfect and makes complete sense (apart from perhaps some minor points that are there only to make the game more interesting - like the limit to the number of players on certain spaces and the inability to use other people's tents).  The game is tense all the way, it has constant nerve wrecking decisions, it has interaction - and it is a racing game, and we all love those, don't we.

Seemed like a fairly average game.  It had some good..the theme, trying to keeping your climbers alive.  Working your way up the mountain, waiting for a break in the weather, then rushing to the summit and back down before freezing to death.

But in terms of game mechanics, it seemed a little too samey/symmetric.  Both myself and another player mirrored every single move.  In the end, we tied.  He did reach the summit one turn before myself so he won the tie-breaker.  But still, it didn't feel like there was a lot of variability in it.  The cards come out randomly, but not sure that makes a lot of difference.

RATING: 7
Players are attempting to get their team of two mountaineers as far up K2 as possible, and survive!  Simple game themed on climbing one of the most treacherous mountains in the world.  Players have a hand of six cards, drawn from a mini-deck of 18.  Each turn they must play three cards to either move their mountaineers on the mountain (up or down), or rest them (acclimatisation).  The mountain pays them back in spades, with weather, local conditions, stacking limits and risk taking by moving two quickly, all contributing to erode the health of your team - who can perish.  Points are scored for the altitude reached, with the summit being worth ten points (quickly reduced to one point if you don't survive the 18 turns).  Neat game, well presented with attractive graphics, and nicely tied to theme.  Solo and family rules also included.  I enjoyed this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Difficult challenge to stay alive while climbing the K2 mountain. Varying weather conditions (I have avalanche expansion) gives different approaches to the peak every gameplay. Players can also gang to trap mountaineers at the peak, and risk killing their opponents.

Most points win, but points are not accumulated. Points are awarded based on the highest point of the mountain reached by your mountaineers.

Played at BGGcon 2015. You get two climbers and they have to get as high on K2 as they can without dying, while at the same time competing for space with the other players. You have to manage your hand, as you can draw either movement or healing, and sometimes you really need one or the other on a turn. 

The mountain has random weather patterns that affect certain elevations and can pile on the damage to your climbers. 

It's very easy to die, but you have enough choice every turn that it's fun to figure out how to proceed. I liked this game.

● The game is simple, and I like how the gameplay+mechanics blend to deliver the reality of climbing a mountain. Like I said, the game is pretty simple but I like how there's is risk for every action you take.
● There's the extreme weather condition (of 18 days hiking), the steep or difficulty at some parts of the mountain and best of all the acclimatisation. 
● I like how fast and simple the game is, but yet still give that amount of itch for a strategy game. Every players get the same set of deck, and we can see how well/bad a player perform.

Finally arrived in the country at FLGS(s). I have to say that the price is on the high side. Now that I finally bought it, I understand the reason behind the price. The game was fully made in Poland and with the obvious reason it came from a small publisher.

For all the hype this game gets, I thought it would be a bit more engaging.  There was a time I was hunting for it, but when it finally got its reprint, I never bit the bullet.  Something about it seemed off for me, so I moved on.  However, I finally got a chance to play it and so jumped at the opportunity.

K2 is by no means a bad game; it's just not terribly fascinating.  The player that climbs the highest with both of his climbers wins.  This is achieved by playing from a personal deck of cards from which you draw 6 cards and choose 3 every turn.  Turn order matters, but cannot be influenced, which is a bit weird, but nevertheless, on your turn, you resolve your 3 cards and either spend movement points or acclimatization points.  Given the limited pool of cards, the game will mostly be obvious - the only real danger is being "reckless" by playing too many movement points, in which case you're rewarded with a penalty token that affects your overall plan.  The crux of the gameplay, though, is that each spot on the mountain can only hold a limited number of people.  This would be far more interesting if you could actually effectively block people entirely, but so long as they have the points to spend, they can leapfrog over your spaces (despite what I say, this isn't always the easiest thing to do given that you'll need quite a handful of points to do this at the peak).

I largely found it to be less about what other people are doing at the table and mostly just making sure you're making efficient moves without putting your climbers in danger of death (or passing out, if you prefer).  It's an enjoyable experience, but I can't imagine that this is the box you'd be reaching for when you want to get a game going.  This is a bit on the light side and would be a much better game if the decisions were a bit more agonizing.  Such as it is, tension only comes when you're at the peak and dangerously getting close to dying, in which case you forfeit that climber's points.  Other than that, so long as you exercise patience, you'll pretty much accomplish most if not all of your goals.

Worth checking out once or twice, but this one just didn't do it for me.  At the same time, it can very well be someone else's cuppa, so I can't be too harsh on it.

RATING: 7.25
This is a game in which players control a team of 2 climbers in a race to the top of K2 and (hopefully) back down.  The game's pacing is a bit slower, but I feel this is acceptable since scaling the world's tallest peak is really a grueling trek rather than a sprint.

There is definitely a good dose of luck in terms of what cards you draw and when you draw them, but I feel it is mitigated somewhat because you can choose which cards to use or not use and save them for later.  Planning ahead using the weather forecast is essential.  Plenty of decisions abound as you must decide when and where to place a tent, when to make a push for the peak, taking into account the risk tokens for being too aggressive, when to descend, what other players are going to do and if they will be in your way, etc.

I find the game to be very thematic as players have to account for weather and acclimate their climbers or risk death.  The urgency for acclimatization and difficulty moving near the top of the peak adds quite a bit of thematic tension.  This is a solid and fun game that I would not hesitate to play anytime.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

K2 plays like a high stakes race where your climbers can die pretty quickly when the weather turns bad.  This has a fantastically integrated theme.  It really feels like I'm on the mountain trying to get to the top.  I've played 2 player games, 3 player games and also the occasional solo play - all were really good.

Best with 3-4.

2015-08-10 : This was Spiel 2011. I had been doing booth work for Matrix Games at the UGG booth for years when Matrix got bought out by Slitherine who decided to have a booth of their own, manned by their own staff.

This suddenly gave me much more freedom to explore the fair itself, so I convinced my wife to come along too and give it a try (and she loved it - we've been going every year since)

Anyway, that first year we entered the halls, looked here and there but the very first game we demo'ed was this one. Now, this is from before games and game-companies from Eastern Europe became big, so imagine a booth the size of a broom closet and people going "Poland ? I didn't know they had games over there ?"

The demo done, we walked away discussing the game and I remember she saying something like "nice game, but there's only 1 viable strategy in it" - I couldn't have agreed more and she had picked up on that flaw on her first game too. That's when I knew we would have a lot of fun demo'ing games and deciding what to buy and what not and going to Spiel would not expose fundamental rifts between our tastes.

My taste is somewhat broader - I like heavy games a lot more - but 95% of what she likes, I like too.

The theme carries this game; it's an exceptional integration. You feel like your meeples are mountainclimbing, Should they succumb on the side of that mountain, if feels like someone real died.

RATING: 7
A surprising game. Feels very thematic (aside from the fact that there are people in the mountain blocking each other to let others freeze to death), plays well and has lots of interaction and a little bit of luck. Wouldn't mind playing it more often.

A fun game - though I wonder about playability. Blocking and up and down health - it basically comes down to maths in which courses are best and getting to the peak at the end of the game!
We decided the tie breaker was to actually climb K2, so I'm glad I managed to grab the summit on the last turn!

RATING: 5
Of course it is a good transversion of extreme climbing . But I couldn't find any tension during play. Interaction is missing completely. Feels like a slow race game with a push you luck element. I know a lot of better games.

RATING: 5
A bland hand management game, both graphically and in terms of game play.  Few interesting strategy decisions.  Failed to engage me in the theme.  A run-of-the-mill Euro game, with little player interaction.  My gaming time better spent elsewhere.

Theme integration par excellence.  Nice progression of tension as you climb the mountain and head back down while trying to avoid death due to a lack of oxygen.

I give the game points for theme with the way the oxygen cards work. I got my two climbers up the mountain but didn't pull enough acclimatization cards to help them breathe. They both died. With only one play, I'm not sure if that was because I didn't manage my hand well enough or if luck plays that big a part.

We were playing on the difficult side of the mountain but using the easier weather, so I guess it was on the "medium" difficulty level. I It's kind of like Tobago in that it's a relaxing game with some mildly interesting decisions but it's too long for a filler and not substantial for anything else.

RATING: 5
Race game with an interesting and novel theme. Gameplay is choosing three of six cards in hand to play and moving your meeple around.

Acclimatisation points are gained or lost depending upon many things such as weather conditions or height your meeple is currently at etc.

Gameplay quickly gets very bogged down at the top with very little movement for any player and god is that bit boring!

Perils are a bit lack lustre and I felt there should have been more of a penalty for racing up the mountain or possible more reward for slowly acclimatising your meeple.

Overall an enjoyable experience but I don't feel the need to own the game but would be happy to play on occasion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some randomness, but essentially a game of timing and conditions. I liked it a lot, and was impressed by the feel of exposure on the high peak. Mountain climbing is hard, and I was proud to keep both my climbers alive, although I came second (and was forced back on my attempt at the peak!). There's a lot to like here, but maybe a shade too much luck in the draw. Moves up my wishlist to acquire though.

***

Played it a second time, really really enjoyed the experience, it's a challenging game and good fun despite being harsh and brutal. I kept thinking about it afterwards, and liked it enough to get a copy myself, in time for...

***
Played it a third time with 5 players, one had played it before. they all lost a climber right near the end game, but I kept both mine alive and so won. Smugly satisfied, but against learners.

K2 fascinates me! It's a fixed board, you know your cards, you can see the weather days ahead, you know the turn order, and yet you keep having hard decisions to make. And the question is always, can I make the big push to the top and still get down before freezing to DEATH? Oh that DEATH, it hovers over you the whole time. In the early rounds, you are care-free, building your strength on the low slopes. Then you begin the ascent and still it's not too hard. But then, as you near the middle game, it just gets harder, as the climbers start jostling for position. if you don't move now, you'll miss your chance to climb. But the weather is turning bad and your tent is already built below you. Go forward, wait or go back?

Aaaaaargh!!

This was just okay.  It felt a little anticlimactic as the last few turns you were either going to hit the top or not.  I didn't feel the tension and logjam at the top.

I could see playing this a few more times, but doubt that I will keep it as it was just okay.

This is a nicely themed race game; interaction comes about in being the most risky and filling up the slots up top.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Disappointed in this one, as I had expected to like it much more. I dislike that three risk tiles are laid open, though this may require a bit more planning, next to the weather forecast. But still you could end up with a hand full of movement cards close before the end, while you desperately needed those condition cards (that are yet to come). And to make it worse, chance is great that by that time only -2 penalty tiles are available. So while others can play some condition cards to avoid the biggest penalty, you end up with it. As a result, you might be forced to climb down to stay alive and get a hand full of condition cards by the end, so no option to climb up again. So to me, a bit too luck driven for a game relying on planning a couple of rounds in advance.

We also didn't use the rope cards to climb down too often. We didn't really feel the need to. Perhaps because we played the easiest setting ? And maybe also because the worst weather cards came in the beginning, while every climber was still down, while by the end there weren't a lot of difficulties while getting near to the top.

Last but not least, I find it odd that the cards use green circles to represent movement, while on the board they are pictured in yellow (the cost to reach them). Perhaps it's not a big deal, but I would have gone for a different approach.

Anyway, I sure need to give it a few more tries (more players, higher difficulty) that might alter my final score, but I guess it will be hard to wipe out my initial disappointment.

After 1 play, I don't like this as much as I had expected. (Maybe that's because I came last and both my climbers died!)
Given that you're just turning over cards, I'm not quite sure how it manages to make you feel like you really are climbing a mountain, facing the weather, battling acclimatization and looking for the best place to pitch your tent. But it does succeed in marrying theme to mechanics and I am now looking forward to playing this again.

Frauensee 2011: Great theme and great tension. However, after 2 games I assume the replayability is quite limited. What I really disliked though was the fact that you could actually finish on the peak without any chance to come down alive (as long as you stay alive until the game is actually over in round 18) THats a serious flaw. But maybe they have changed this in the expansion.

RATING: 6.8
Régóta érdekelt, mivel egy nagyon tematikus eurónak mondták mindenhol. Ehhez képest sajnos csalódás volt. Nem mondom, hogy rossz játék, de a tematikát nekem agyonvágja egy-két mechanizmus benne:
- milyen már, hogy max pontot ér az a hegymászó, aki a játék végére feljutott a hegycsúcsra, de láthatóan a következő körben fixen meghal.
- Emiatt az egész arról szól, hogy az egyiket felviszed külön, majd ha leért akkor a másikat is felviszed minél magasabbra, mivel jól időzítve azt már úgyse kell lehoznod.

Ezek kivédésére (meg amúgy is) jó lenne valami szabály, hogy a két hegymászód egymást segíti, ha együtt haladnak. Pl.: olyan mezőre lépni, ahol már ott áll egy másik eggyel olcsóbb. Így legalább egyes szakaszokon megérné együtt menni.

A pleasant card management, race game.  The components are nice quality and the rules are easy to explain.

Nice theme, and the matching game mechanics *kinda* work. In the end it's somewhat dull and lacks pace and any kind of 'final act' play tension.

Very interesting hand management game.  K2 has elements it shares with race games but one would be foolish if they thought that getting to the summit first is the goal of the game.  Survival is key.  

This is a tough game when the weather and cards don't align.  There is luck, but in a very thematic (doesn't feel random) sort of way.  You know what cards you have, you can see the upcoming weather, yet as obvious as things seem the choices remain tough.  

The game scales well as space limits dwindle with fewer players.  

The design is clean, stripped down to the essentials while still remaining evocative of the theme.  

Wonderful game.

Rating increased to a nine after playing a game where everyone struggled mightily and the winner walked away with a mere 4 points.  The death toll on K2 was brutal.

A solid race to the top, with bonus points for the opportunity to camp out in the bottleneck and force your opponents to freeze to death on top of a mountain. The card-driven mechanics make it feel very fair, and when you push your luck that little bit too far you only feel you have yourself to blame.

Or that guy camped out just below the summit getting in your way. You can blame him too.

Enjoyable game of sending two climbers up the mountain, while trying to manage your lung acclimatization. We definitely got sucked into thinking it was going to be a cake walk up to the top, until we got near the peak. Both my climbers died when I made a break for the peak with one of them, and couldn't draw a single positive acclimatization card for nine cards. Some rules still seemed unclear after several readings -- does a player move all his pieces at once, or do you take turns? But overall a fun experience.

This has possibly the strongest connection of theme to game mechanics I have ever encountered. You really get the feeling you're running out of life force as you near the peak and play becomes suitably nerve wracking. It's a shame the game board is a bit warped. (The Broad Peak expansion board is warped, too, so I imagine there was a problem with the cardboard stock.) It's still a great game. The best "racing" game I own.

Received in the July 2014 European Maths Trade in exchange for Khet 2.0.

Played once on the easiest settings, 3p, came second. Then soloed it on the hardest setting and got a pretty good score (by the skin of my teeth) of 15. First time I've ever soloed a game. It kind of made me understand a bit why "min-maxing" is sometimes seen as a bad thing. But the game is fun, with an excellently incorporated theme.

Played it again 2p - this is totally multiplayer solitaire...

A mountain climbing game that gets the experience right.
I've played this digitally on Board Game Arena, which is a very good approximation of the table-top game, but it's even more unforgiving when played on a computer. If you mess up while playing the board game in your living room, you can easily do a turn over, and most people playing with you will be glad to let you do it, but in the cold, unflinching digital world, your tiny oversight can lead to one or both of your climbers ending up dead.
And that, my friends, is K2. 
A game that is actively trying to kill you. 

No two ascents to the mountain top will be the same, thanks to brilliant design elements like weather and "risk." Plus, it can get crowded at the top, and climbers from other teams can block you from either going higher or lower, a hardship that happens on real climbs, and was an integral part of the 2008 disaster on K2 that cost 11 people their lives.
Mount Everest is only 237 feet higher, but K2 requires a steeper approach, and one in four attempts to reach it's summit ends in death. Also, it has never been conquered in winter, making it the most dangerous mountain in the world.
That knowledge always hangs over me when I play this game. Some people say it isn't perfect, or that the beginning is too slow. That doesn't bother me, as the difficulty ramps up quickly, and it can be very tense as you reach the higher elevations. There's also a large luck element in that you're drawing from a deck of cards, and those cards affect your movement and acclimatization, and a badly drawn hand can spell disaster. But that luck element works for me in this game where I might not be so forgiving in other games. I've played K2 seven times and only won once. Out of those seven plays, I've lost one of my pair of climbers four times, which is about the average death-rate on the real mountain.
I'm willing to overlook the luck element here because it has an emotional impact. Like Letters from Whitechapel, I feel the history behind this game, and it's unsettling.
K2 is never going to give you a break, and even if it does, you are totally aware of your cards and what is left in your deck. There are only 18 cards, and if you used up all of your acclimation cards getting to 7000 feet, then you won't have any way to save your climber when the wind picks up at 8000 feet.  
That's what makes a great game for me; the creation of an experience. I get to do something using cardboard and wooden tokens that I could never achieve in real life.  Or, if I could actually experience it for real, I may not live to tell anyone about it.
I can tell you about my last game of K2. 
I lost one climber above the 7000 foot marker when his tent didn't provide adequate shelter from a snow storm. I actually knew the storm was coming, but I decided to risk my position instead of climbing down to a more safe zone, thinking my new hand of cards would give me the acclimation I needed to reach the summit on the next day.
There was no next day.
I took a risk, and it didn't pay off. That climber, and the score he had accumulated up to that point, disappeared, leaving nothing behind but an empty tent that no one else could use.
K2 doesn't favor risk.
It favors no one. Ever. You can look up the images online of the perfectly preserved bodies that litter the path to the summit as a testament to why K2 is called the "Savage Mountain."
Great games create great experiences.

The author did seem to have done everything right, but the game doesn't get me. At heart it's a resource management game. Giving the point your two meeples are standing on the map, the weather conditions urge you what cards to choose for this round. I felt being played instead of doing my own decisions, as it was pretty obvious what cards to play, as you only have a combination of oxygen and climbing cards. So in the end, assuming you do not make any mistakes, if you succeed or not is depending of the draw of the right cards at the right moments. This is a major turn off. Furthermore last players will have problems with movement as there are severe max. amounts of meeples on one spot.

RATING: 8
The mountaineering theme is nicely modelled by a few elegant game mechanisms. A player's decisions of where to move the two climbers are influenced not only by the limited hand of cards that determine movement and acclimatisation, but also by the weather forecast that shows ahead of time which areas of the mountain will be less safe in future turns (days). Is this the right time to rest this climber or should he rather push ahead? The climber could make it to the summit in this move, but will I be able to keep him alive in the oncoming weather?

Survival is always a gripping theme, and this little game packs a punch. Two game boards and two sets of seasonal weather conditions keep my interest.

Not overwhelmed yet: the system is well designed, and the balance between taking risks and resting is well implemented. 
But with 4-5 it is too long for what it is, and the solitaire game has very little to offer (cold and mathematical; unless you play very badly, you will always make a very decent score, and unless the random elements pop up at exactly the right moment, you will never be able to do a perfect one).
 I should maybe try it with 2 or 3…

Nice theme implementation and excellent artwork, but gameplay is unengaging, a bit dull. It also has the serious flaw of a player being practically eliminated in the middle of the game and having to play until the end, because if one of your climbers die, you may only hope that every other player also loses a climber. And being blocked can often be annoying, but that is all the player interaction in the game.

I cannot recommend this game at all for 2 players. Based on reviews I was expecting a tense and action packed ascent up the mountain. What I got was a game with almost no player interaction that really just came down to playing some cards in response to the weather. It was always obvious which cards I should play base on the situation, so there were really not many tough decisions. There was a bit of press your luck when deciding to charge for the peak and hope you got the cards you need in the right order to stay acclimatized and get back down. I am not sure how it would play with more players, but I generally don't have more so I cannot test it out. I doubt I would like it any more given that I am just not a fan of the mechanics.

Very cool game.
So simple, but so thematic!
Artwork of both editions is incredibly.

You kinda can imagine the feeling the mountaineers must get looking at this impressive, incredible dangerous mountain. Everything is very evocative.

Being able to play this at 4 different difficulty levels is extremely cool while still feeling thematic. (summer/winter mountain board, summer/winter weather)
That mountain & it's weather knows no mercy, once the first mountaineer dies because he took too much a risk, players are taken aback about just how dangerous it is.

Some are irritated by the anti-thematic ending where a climber could make it to the top just on the last turn, to escape death by the game end.
If you want to fix that i'd suggest the houserule, that you play for one more day in wich no one reaches any new hights, but simply has to keep his climbers alive. E voilá.

I tend to lose this game. 

The opening game is rather slow. I wish there were many more and earlier bottlenecks in the game. I also wish failure to cope with the acclimatization didn't result in immediate death (or rescure by heli), but rather a tumultous descent to the nearest camp and subtraction of a few points.

Really this is a Euro-ised version of that children's staple, Snakes and Ladders. You have a hand of cards to determine how far up you can move and an advance view of the 'weather' that may make it prudent to come down. There are some elements of risk management involved, but I see this more as family fare than one for gamers.

Very good game. It presents the best type of conflict I've ever found in a game. It is indirect, at the same time brutal, and at the same time you don't get to hate your opponents. You feel just respect for them, because they are all in the same hell as you.
Also, one of the most thematic games. So much theme in so few components.

Wonderful, immersive theme. Definitely pretty. Nothing stands out as super beautiful, though. I like the squiggly player/tent.

I love the way you can plan out everything in this game, but have to decide how much risk you will allow to factor into your plan. Then you have to measure that against the accomplishments of your opponents. And it is a very different game with more players, as things get tighter. You can play it safe, but if another player is just a notch less safe, they may get the edge on you. Or they may die. I love the choices presented.

RATING: 6
I've played:
- summer (good) weather and easy approach
- summer (good) weather and difficult approach
- winter (bad) weather and difficult approach

This is an OK game with some issues:
- first part (going through lower regions of the mountain) is not exciting and obvious 
- too often the game is decided by racing element (who gets high first, wins).  This happens even with bad weather and on difficult approach.  The game should reward preparation more.
- you can attack the peak in last turn(s) not caring about the descend (and survival).  That's so gamey...  And it ruins the balance of the game.
- randomness - in a critical moment you can draw cards which destroy your whole effort...

Besides the above specific reservations I'm just not excited by the game.

I played prototype many times, especially the solo variant. It's a very good middle weight euro game, where the feeling of actually climbing up the mountain is very present. Players have to solve problems similar to those solved by the climbing team - cope with changing weather, acclimatization, safe descent etc. I especially like the two weather settings (summer and winter) and that the winter conditions make the game really much, much more difficult.

Perhaps the best mountain climbing game out there, K2 combines simple mechanics with difficult, strategic decisions that match theme well.  Four different combinations possible (from "easy" to difficult, including two different sides to the board), players aim to get their two climbers as high as they can, even reaching the summit, while surviving the difficult conditions for 18 days.  The first play very different than the 10th, the game has depth that derives from the unpredictability of player interaction and learning the little but important details.

Each player has two climbers and each turn you choose a hand of 3 cards from a draw of 6. The cards are used to move climbers or raise their acclimatization levels, which can drop fast at high altitudes and in bad weather. Your score is equals the highest level that each of your climbers have reached added together. Bad weather, risk tokens that you get if you try to move too fast, and the higher you go on the mountain all reduce your climbers' Acclimatization Levels. Climbers die if their level gets to zero and the score for a dead climber is not counted.

You don't truly realize how difficult this game can be until you see that your climber got so high that she cannot get back to a safe location to stay alive. With movement and grouping limitations getting up the mountain safely is not obvious. The weather is drawn randomly, but you can always see 3-5 turns in advance, so it becomes a key part of your planning. A thoughtful, fun, and thematic euro.

This game is a gem. Brilliant card management with some risk element. Strategic and tactical. Lots of "forecasting" elements for deeper gameplay. Engrossing theme... some US publisher has GOT to bring this game here ASAP.

edit: After playing several times, I realize that the margin between the winner and the others is very small... usually the winner ends up being the person who went to the peak the first.

I will have to play with the winter side to see if this problem is resolved, because I feel like always winning by the tiebreaker rule is not satisfying. I want to win by being the highest, alone.

Played the game, it's good. We played with five people but with the easy side and the easy space limits. It was a little too easy so I'd like to try it again with more brutal competition. I still can't justify paying the huge price for this, but I'm thinking about it. I would definitely like to own it at some point or have access to it ;)

--------------------------------
Read the rules. It seems pretty good. Players choose 3 cards each round to help move their two climbers around the mountain, or acclimatize them. You record the highest point each of the climbers reaches and score points for that at the end of the game. The weather beats you up as do the higher positions on the mountain, spending acclimatization points. Your climbers can die if they run out so it seems you'd stock up and then make a dash for the top.

Would like to play it. The games will be tight due to the nature of things, and you may end up feeling shafted by your card draw... "I could have made it to that space and beat you, if only I hadn't drawn so many acclimatization cards".

Played twice on e family game once full difficulty both times with 3 Players. 

Th game has little in the way of interaction or tension. The action point card mechanic is not very themeatic and leads to few decisions. The risk tokens are a missed opportunity - having 3 face up is giving too much information. Overall the game is 'nice' but lacking anything substantial to keep a gamer coming back.

Eurogames don't get much more true to its theme than K2. Once you are close to the top you suffer  with your climber when bad weather sets in, hope for a second breath or just other climbers making way. Too bad that the first third to half of the game is a lackluster preparation for things to come. There's a single decision whether you will race ahead with one climber or push both simultaneously but hand management doesn't matter much at that time. Luckily, the game gets more interesting when climbers get stuck because of other climbers blocking the way and the route demanding thoughtful play of your cards. If played with the winter weather cards or the difficult side, K2 is a nice occasional diversion for serious gamers that don't mind calm first 30 minutes. On the easy side with the good weather cards it's family friendly fare.

A good game, with mechanic that is different then in the other games I plaid. Creates continuous tension of keeping your Alpinist alive. This game adds cooperative play elements into concurrent play: not only you must fight your opponents in order to score more points, but you also have to fight the game in order to survive.

Geras žaidimas, su mechanika, kurios neradau jokiame kitame iki šiol žaistame žaidime. Nuolat bandant išsaugoti alpinistų gyvybę sukuriama nuolatinė įtampa. Šis žaidimas prideda kooperatinių žaidimų elementų į konkurencinio tipo žaidimus: privalai ne tik varžytis su kitais žaidėjais dėl taškų, bet ir kovoti prieš žaidimą, siekiant išgyventi.

A nice theme and the game pumps a lot out of it using a wide array of things that are probably reality to the real climbers. Early game is a bit bland, but as you get higher and higher the tension grows nicely. The end of the game can however be a bit of an anticlimax if it's too crowded on the top and someone may sit in his tent on top or near the top. So, luck has its role here and player order can be a deciding factor here and there, especially considering the tiebreaker, but K2 is quite an elegant game in the end and having two sided board and two sets of action cards it may have considerable lifetime.

Más de 15 partidas. Quieres escalar el K2? con este juego puedes hacerlo. Juego sencillo de aprender que deja muy buen sabor de boca, jugable para jugones y no jugones de 1 a 5 jugadores.
Consiste en intentar coronar el primero el K2 y sobrevivir con tus dos escaladores los 18 días que dura la escalada.

RATING: 10
K2 is a strongly thematic game of mountaineering. Each player continuously manages a small hand of cards. You use them to move climbers up the face of the second-highest mountain in the world while allowing them to acclimatise to the altitude. The ever-changing weather plays an important part in the game, and if you don’t pay it sufficient attention, your assault on the peak may end in calamity. 

This game is accessible to non-gamers, as it might be described as a straightforward race to the top, and the ways in which it diverges from a race are thematically intuitive. It isn't Monopoly, though; it requires each player to think carefully about their moves, and increasingly so as the climbers move up the mountain. It allows (and indeed obliges) you to plan ahead, although - given the element of chance that is nicely integrated into the theme - your plans may not turn out as you’d hoped. In particular, you may find that you neglected to take account of the element of risk you incur in racing ahead... 

The rules are simple, and easily explained, but there is still room for disaster if the person explaining them doesn't realise that their explanation is ambiguous. In one introductory game I managed to explain one very simple rule (the one covering movement by rope) in such a way that it caused the death of a mountaineer two weeks later near the summit of the mountain; both other players interpreted what I thought I had said in way that proved not just dangerous, but catastrophic. 

The only quibble I have with the game is that the weather is accurately predicted for today, tomorrow and for at least 2 days beyond that into the future, while the luck of the draw strongly influences the player's capacity to move or to acclimatise. Though this works perfectly well in the context of the game mechanics, for thematic reasons I would have preferred the element of chance to be higher in the weather prediction and lower in the player's options. Maybe I need a house rule to reduce the certainty of the weather.

In sum, an excellent game, which I'll get to the table as often as possible, both with newcomers to designer boardgames and died-in-the-wool gamers. Or should I say dead-on-the-mountain gamers?

This is a fun and intense theme game. I don't know if it's the perfect blend of art and mechanics or what, but this game really takes me somewhere else when I play it.  I have to remind myself to breathe and lower my stress, because it's that good.

It's not necessarily a complex game compared to some, but if you're a person who gets easily immersed in a strong theme, this may raise your blood pressure. Quick, play a blue card!

Pretty fun figuring out routes and factoring altitude, oxygen, weather and so on as you climb your way up. Feels appropriately tough! But when it gets to the pointy end of business the whole thing becomes a bit too game-y at the expense of theme for me.

I have only played this game solo and two player. I enjoyed it each time but would definitely like to give it a go with more players as i reckon it will be even tighter and some of the climbers might even get frozen at the top. To date everybody has made it to the end of the game.

これはゲーマー向けかもしれない。ソロ(冬山天候良）、二人（夏山天候良）、四人（夏山天候悪）でプレイしてみた所、なかなか頂上に立てず苦労した。冬山は登れないところを我慢して登るしかないのだろうか？ソロでも相当面白いです。感染キューブの処理が面倒なパンデミックよりも好み。山はブロードピーク以外にもファンがエベレストを公開しているので是非挑戦してみたい。ルールで一か所?な点がある。1以下になったら死亡(Below 1)とルールにあるので1も含む?なんとなく0になったら死亡が普通じゃないかな?

Juego sencillo y de corta duración, la tematica difiere del resto de juegos y ayuda a que no se parezca a otro, pero en realidad se trata de gestionar bien tu mano y vigilar el tiempo todo el rato.

Pocas veces podrás bloquear a alguien con ambos exploradores, solo en la cumbre puede pasar, donde con uno solo de los alpinistas basta para bloquear.

Se queda a medio camino, le falta algo para que resulte más interesante.

RATING: 9
This is just a fantastic game! Every time I play this game, I am more impressed by the tension that exists and the agonizing decisions created based on your climbers' situations on the mountain and the cards you have available to play. And that's not to mention trying to figure out what the other players are going to do once space gets more limited near the summit. This game is simply a triumph!

A great thematic game that definitely makes me feel like I'm on a mountain, and the descent is just as difficult as the ascent. The game's mechanics are elegant, and the strategy is ample. Multiple maps give this game some good replayability, and players can attack the mountain different ways. I need to play this some more, as I suspect the game's rating would go up.

Good hand management race game. Thematic feel of actually climbing a mountain. Harsh decisions. Trying to survive. But the endgame is annoying as you can block the other players from reaching the top. Get as first to the top with your second climber and stay there. Nothing the others can do. Frustrating. Disappointing. Note: only played with the summer cards on the easy route.

RATING: 6
K2 would be more interesting and thematic if the climbers would need to come back down from the summit. 

Now the end game can get very gamey, as some players can leave their climber(s) standing still at the top of the mountain, since they know those climbers will (barely) survive to the end of the last round. (Played on tougher board.)

I was thinking of teaching this on thursday so I got a sologame in. Despite having played numerous games not nearly as  much as some people on this site but still a respectable number I went with the advice of the rulebook playing on the sunny side and  in good weather conditions. 

I scored the maximum of 20 points. 

Scoring the maximum is a disappointment for me and for that reason i'm not too sure I will play this on thursday.

Having said that I had high expectations.
and I have to admit that it is a nice little game of handmanagement. I can see it getting more interesting with more players (blocking, although then can pass through)  and more difficult weather conditions to deal with.

I might have to upgrade my rating if my friends enjoy playing this. For now it is a game I plan to play with my uncle and serge who is new to gaming.

Played once, 4p.  This is not a game that rewards strategy very much.  It is a race game that initially fools you into thinking you have quite a bit of control over your fate.  It won't take you long to realize, though, that there are too many sources of randomness coupled with a game of chicken with your opponents.  The only thing you'll know for sure is; you played your lung cards too soon.  Even thoug I won, I admit it was a hollow victory, achieved mostly via luck, and have no desire to ever play again.

RATING: 6.5
A simple and often punishing game where the theme really comes through.  The customizable difficulty system makes this adaptable to various crowds.  Probably better with less people as things are a bit less chaotic and downtime is reduced.  Winning strategies involved somewhat exploiting the system (blocking spots, pushing to a deadly spot on the last turn where you couldn't survive long but are saved by the end of the game, etc.) which I felt took away from the experience.  Overall a light and fast game that feels very tense and hardcore.

Ein Wettlaufspiel.
Jeder Spieler hat 2 Bergsteiger. Ziel ist es sie so weit wie möglich an die Spitze des Berges zu bringen und sie bis zum Ende des Spiels nicht erfrieren zu lassen, damit man die meissten Punkte erhält.
Je höher man klettert, desto weniger Figuren dürfen auf einem Feld stehen. Vorzupreschen und dann den Rückweg blockiert zu bekommen, genauso wie langsam hochschleichen können jeweils Probleme bereiten. Sehr wichtig ist auf das Wetter zu achten. Man weiss immer schon 3-5 Züge im Voraus in welchen Regionen es schwer wird. So muss ich planen, dass ich zu den Zeitpunkten nicht in diesen Regionen bin.
Ein sehr schönes Spiel.

Now this is a pretty good game. I really feel the tension and difficulty of trying to climb a mountain, making sure that I do not go too far and managing my oxygen levels.

The games played very differently due to the weather, although we used the same (easy) setup both times.

It is frustrating to be blocked of from the summit, but time will show if that can be played around in a satisfying way.

I’ll try to play it wintry side up to see whether that livens things up.

Ciekawy przypadek gry, której ocena rośnie wraz z ilością rozegranych partii; Początkowo dałem jej ocenę 8, po kilkunastu partiach rozegranych solo, moja ocena wzrosła do 9;

Wariant solo bardzo satysfakcjonujący; Nawet na najłatwiejszym poziomie trzeba sporo myśleć, a zdobycie 20 punktów jest dużym osiągnięciem; Gra ładna, z bardzo dużą regrywalnością, dobrze oddanym klimatem, krótkim czasem gry (na wariant solo wystarcza ok. 20-25 minut), minimalnym czasem potrzebnym na przygotowanie do gry; Zasady na tyle proste, że każdemu da się ją wytłumaczyć w dosłownie kilka minut; No i nie potrzeba dużej ilości miejsca na stole żeby rozegrać partię;

Z minusów: wypraska byłaby fantastyczna, gdyby swobodnie mieściła karty w koszulkach; Ale nie mieści... Plansza mogłaby być lepszej jakości, chociaż nie jest zła; No i jeden z żetonów aklimatyzacji w moim egzemplarzu był uszkodzony, ale na szczęście Rebel w ciągu dwóch dni od zgłoszenia dosłał mi nowy, nieuszkodzony znacznik;

Solo: I love this game! I won all three on the lowest difficulty, but felt driven to best my previous game each time; normally a solo game I don't lose a lot is a problem, but here it was satisfying. There are three other difficulties to try once I feel like I've mastered the easy level, too.

It feels like it should, thematically (I'm fascinated by high altitude mountaineering and have read quite a bit about K2 and Everest): climbers are forced to turn back or die, the Death Zone is painful, weather can guarantee or torpedo a summit bid, the routes (as best as I can recognize them) match the difficulty of K2's routes, tents and timing matter, and it's a challenge. There are lots of levers to manipulate, and the hand and decks management are deeper than a 6-card hand and and 18-card deck would suggest.

It sets up quickly and plays in a very enjoyable 30-40 minutes. The bits are great, and the board is gorgeous. The solo rules are smooth and well done, not an afterthought. Unlike some games I've played solo, it looks like it will be a lot of fun with more players -- there are elements of the game that aren't engaged in solo, like being the first to summit (more points), trying to avoid risk tokens, and jockeying for spots at higher elevations.

---

After 9 solo games, my best score stands at 16 on easy/summer. I've only come close to matching it once, with a 15. This is an enjoyably tough game!

---

Multiplayer: K2 is great in multiplayer, too! Blocking spaces becomes huge, and risk tokens take on a different dimension. It's easy to teach, plays at the listed time, and delivers a fun experience throughout. I'd say I like solo and multiplayer about equally as much.

K2 is an interesting game. First, it's really light, definitely a gateway. Players simply play 3 cards every round  in order to 1) get their climbers to the top of K2 and 2) stay alive. The card play is simple and intuitive. Everyone has the same deck of cards (Witch's Brew style). The game is quite thematic, but surprisingly, you only "feel" the theme as you are approaching the summit of the mountain. In this way, your journey up K2 provides more and more tension the higher you climb. Once you make it to the top (if you do), you still have to make it back down, or at the very least, stay alive. This is where is gets exciting. So, my main beef with the game is that it is only riveting/thematic for part of the way. The first few turns don't generate that much tension. They feel more like you are just going through the motions. Admittedly, I've only played with 2 players, and with that on easy. Maybe the other side of the board creates more tension earlier on, balancing the gameplay. I would bet this is the case, at least to some degree. Plus, with more players, your movement would become more interesting even at the lower points of the mountain. In addition, the publisher has produced a "Broad Peak" expansion that offers more modes of gameplay, including a "race to the top," which would fixes the lagging behind strategy early in the game (which can be quite unexciting). The bits are nice and the art is well done, contributing to theme immersion. All in all, I really like this one. I would highly recommend it, as long as you are aware of the aforementioned shortcomings.

What I like:
- Very thematic and tense.  At times you do feel like you're on the verge of dying.
- Player interaction through cramped space 
- Difficulty can be adjusted through the easy/hard 
mountain, and the summer/winter weather
- Risk helps mitigate someone playing a combo of high movement cards

What I don't like:
- Sometimes the timing of the cards you draw and the weather make it impossible to get very high 
- First player advantage with weather timing is more pronounced with more players

Repeated play shows this to be a great family game. In the second game I was trying to "help" my daughter who was keeping both her climbers at the base of the hill gathering strength by encouraging her to start climbing. Well, she ended up winning doing things her own way.

After one play seemed to go over well with my family.  There is some strategy, I expect I will see more of the subtleties after another play or two.  The theme is really great and the game has a good feel for the subject.

Enjoyable game, with turns playing quickly.  Think it would be better with >2 players as the blocking options would become more important.  

Keen to play again at some point.  Learned from the rules, which are laid out chronologically based on turn order - which isn't the easiest way to actually teach the game.  Would be easier with an experienced player teaching (eg explain risk tokens last).  A solid 7 to begin with, may go higher.

Only game so far, 4 player, easy map & Summer weather. Turn order seemed critical really, especially as the 2nd climbers in the team were nearing the top.

Top marks for a novel theme. Not a lot of scope for replay value. Like climbing Everest the challange is over. It is a nice experience once, but play is always the same and I feel it has a major problem with bottle-necking at the top. Too hard to get down if you are blocked.

One of the best games of Essen 2010.

Good 'family style' game that really captivates the theme! My first two plays were 2 and 4 player sessions, and the game scales well.

I also like the 2-sided board ('easy' and 'hard' side), and the double amount of weather cards (easier 'summer' and harder 'winter' cards) that will improve the replayability.

It's a challenging game, in both 'easy' games ('easy' board and 'easy' weather) a mountaineer died (we played without the rescue cards), so it will be pretty tough to win on the hard side with winter weather!

Good: Board looks great, and the mechanics are nice. Several difficulties to choose from. Nice theme and well implemented.

Bad: Climbers + Tents block needed information on the board tiles. The more players, the more prone to analysys paralyses (planning is simultaneous, and player order is very important because of possible blocking of spots on the mountain.

Game in a Nutshell: Play a small hand of cards to get your two climbers as high up the mountain as you safely can.

Played as: 1,2,3,4,5 player

Pros: Where other games scream "only dorks would play this," this game has a unique and all encompassing appeal. There are good thematic ties with the game and its mechanisms. You really feel the stress and challenge of those last few pushes to the top, and that huge sinking feeling in your gut when you realize you can't survive the trip down. The game scales well and even provides many (all?) of the same thrills playing solo.

Cons: There's some things that make sense strategically that break the spirit of the theme like ending the game at the top of the mountain or separating your climbers. With each player playing their own hand of cards, not everyone is on equal ground when the timing might be right for a strong push up the mountain. While there is some self balancing built in for that, the person whose hand best lines up with the weather and other factors is going to be the winner (so long as they have a basic understanding of what can happen and what not to do).

Other: What's interesting about this game is for the most part, while competitive, most people I've played with are more consumed with their own personal journey up the mountain. And I think that's both great and thematic. Climbing mountains isn't like war or sports, it's about doing your own personal best.

Best Use: This game is all about the theme, if it appeals to you or prospective gamers, then use it.

RATING: 8.5
The game is a lot of fun, and incredibly challenging. You truly feel like you are struggling to make your way up the mountain. You become very wary of acclimatisation and the weather forecast, and the need to prepare yourself for both of these factors. Deciding when and where to set up camp is crucial, as while acclimatisation is more important further up the mountain, the harsh conditions of the area often negate the benefits of setting up camp within that location. While I mostly focused on one climber only, it became apparent that to get further up the mountain, using the tents of both climbers (at the expense of speed in ascending the mountain) at strategic points would be much more beneficial.

Player interaction is fairly minimal, with only the limitations of each space (that is, the number of players permitted to remain on a space at one time) being a consideration when competing with other players. However, this does not mean this is a bad game by any means, just not an overly competitive offering, is all.

After the first couple turns, I was thinking that this was going to be a pretty easy game that I'd have to pull out the 'hard' board to make interesting.  However, it turned out to be quite a tough one.  Neither of us made the summit, and we survived by the skin of our teeth.  Quite thematic, and variable levels of difficulty and the solo option should bring it out a few times.

Although I thoroughly enjoyed my climb to the top, I also had the feeling I wasn't experiencing anything new. K2 reminded me of games such as Niagara, Snow Tails and Fast Flowing Forest Fellers.

The one thing I did not like was the 'blocking' mechanism. It feel that it's not in the spirit of the theme, and moreover its frustrating that seating order determines whether your guy gets killed or not.

Good tight survival/push your luck/hand management game! The weather tiles add change to every play, and the back to back board give you a summer (easier) or winter (harder) board to traverse. If you get it wrong you get punished, if you time everything right....which is hard, you will more then likely hit the peak and survive.

I'm glad to have played this, but can't say I'm begging to play it again. There's of course some skill in managing your hand and knowing what cards are coming up, but twice in the game you're drawing completely blind, which can dash whatever plans you might have made. It reminded me a bit of Snow Tails, another card-driven race game, and I'd probably rather play the latter, especially since it has variable layouts to keep things fresh.

Uno de los juegos que tengo que más me gusta jugar. Tiene la ventaja que se puede jugar sólo y aún así sigue teniendo "miga". Lo más divertido es jugar cinco, ya que la estrategia es vital si no quieres dejar cadáveres en la montaña....
Juego con variabilidad en la dificultad grande, eso es precisamente una de las cosas que más me gusta, que el nivel varía desde normal a casi imposible. 
Casi imposible de conseguir 20 puntos es jugar solo con clima de invierno y por la cara chunga, un reto sólo para los más atrevidos (o a los que nos les importe sacrificar alpinistas...).

Great Climbing theme , after this game you just want to pack yourself and go out to reach a mountain, the game have 5 difficulty level, so you can start from the easiest and finish with the hardest, but be careful to don't let your climber die or you will probably lose the game.Great game, a little of randomness during card drawing but not so heavy.

After another play i see to many randomness and some boring scheme, some winning move and i switch my rate from 7.25 to 6 but i will try some more game in the future just to try the hardest possible weather and board before making my final rate.

主題:1
主題強烈的遊戲，就是爬山，爬世界最危險的高山K2，利用每回合有限的手牌選擇，配合每回合的天氣變化，在有限的空間內站位置紮營，算是擬真度很高的主題遊戲。個人圖板中還有氧氣度的標示，代表著玩家適應高山惡劣氣候的數據。完成第一個登頂的固然重要，本遊戲還有最重要的一個目標，活到最後的人才能算分。看過登山災難片"超越顛峰"或是"我要活下去"就知道登山是多麼具有挑戰性的活動了!

美術:0.9
本遊戲美術也是一個賣點，看著令人畏懼的K2圖板，男女有別的米寶，個人行動卡牌上栩栩如生的登山客，玩完整套遊戲，不得不說真的好想去爬山。

規則:1
簡單好教學，很容易讓新手上手的行動牌選擇及米寶卡位遊戲。遊戲過程中還加入未來天氣預報，可以讓你規劃未來的攻頂策略，不過山上小徑，只容許少數人通過，前面卡好位置的人，常常讓後面攻頂的玩家很得牙癢癢。適時的選擇紮營，可以讓自己跟夥伴躲過惡劣的氣候，算是很有情境的玩法。

設置:1
分配個人圖版及配件後，就可以開始遊戲，設置非常方便。

路線:0.4
遊戲過程就是預測未來天氣變化，管理手牌行動力，注意自己的氧氣度。遊戲策略選擇不多，就是在競爭過程中，選擇登頂路線及扎營位置，避免被人卡到或者是去卡住別人。

互動:0.9
本遊戲互動玩家間強烈，原本登山應該是互相合作，克服大自然，但這個比賽卻是比互相陷害卡人，最好是讓別人的登山客凍死在路途中，呵呵!還真是一個害人大賽，遊戲過程可以拿去拍"巔峰戰士了"

個人:0.9
本人很愛的遊戲，主題強烈，美術棒，遊玩過程真的很像爬山，最重要的這款遊戲還可以單人挑戰，多人玩也有不同的趣味。

朋友:0.8
玩過的都說棒，只是互相陷害有時會破壞感情，哈哈玩遊戲而已，不意太介意。

想玩:0.8
策略性中等，考驗著是手牌管理能力及登頂路線選擇，只要有人奉陪我一定會玩。遊戲人數1-5人彈性很夠。

收藏:1
除了本遊戲我還想收擴充 只可惜徵不到。

總分:8.7
講評:這遊戲充分表露出人心險惡的醜陋，當然了要玩的和平也是可以，那就大家轉換心情，一個人都不能丟下，每個玩家的兩個米寶都要攻頂並安全下山，假如有一個米寶陣亡，全體玩家就算輸了。假如能這樣玩，當作合作遊戲也是不錯的。不知有誰想試試看。

Love this game.  Thematic, great artwork, and creates memorable moments.

The first time we played, my wife raced to the top of the mountain with me close on her heels, only to get stuck at the summit during bad weather.  By the time her climber finally succumbed to the worsening conditions, my own climber, who had been waiting out the storm right below the summit, was in such bad shape he died the next turn (RIP Sherpa Bob).  Our friend, who had been waiting further down the mountain, then leisurely cruised to victory.  Great first impression for a great game.

A good theme that can makes it to practice. Not exactly an easy game either, as careful planning is needed for your climbers to go high but survive. I question the replayability though, and it's kind of a multi-player solitare,

Interesting game with gorgeous components. Play is tense, with a nice mechanism that rewards you if you outguess your opponents.
I regret that the game is not a bit more thematic: same team climbers barely support one another, different team climbers compete with each other to the point they would let someone else froze to death outside their tent. This is too much for my taste.

You control a team of two climbers attempting to climb K2. The higher you climb, the more VPs you achieve. However you must manage your acclimitisation because if it ever goes less than one, you die. The higher you go, the greater the penalty on acclimitisation.  Each turn you have 6 cards, and you pick 3 of them to play. THe cards either give you movement points or give you acclimitisation points. They range in number from 0-3 for acclimitisation and 1-3 for movement. The player who reveals the most movement points also get a penalty marker to apply to a climber.

It's an okay game, but the range in card values is a bit much, and the luck can get you with no acclimitisation or low values.  The penalty doesn't seem to balance it out. Now I have to admit, I'm still not clear on the acclimitisation rules, so I have to read them again . I might have missed losing acclimitisaton points by moving too quickly. It's interesting, and would try it again.

Bought as a filler/family game, but we pretty quickly realised that whilst it fills these rolls, there is a deeper strategy game hidden in there.

Extremely pleasantly surprised. We knew we'd like it and it would be fun,but we didn't realise it would be as good as it is.

As a bonus it plays fairly quickly and is accessible to all, including non-gamers.

Very simple system, but well done.  Like the implementation of the random element in the weather (i.e. you see what's coming up over the next six turns) and how it affects your planning for the summit push.

A lot to like here - though unsure of long-term replayability.  Theme is a great fit for the mechanics - well done all around.

Years ago I watched a Shut-up and Sit Down video review of K2. Their description reminded me of a mini-game inside Final Fantasy VII where your party has to scale a cliff in the frozen northern wastes. The frigid temperatures are constantly chipping away at your party's body temperature. Let it fall to low and the party dies. Body temperature can be regained by warming yourselves at the ledges between climbing intervals. 

This also works as a description of what you are doing in game of K2. The only difference being that in K2 you are trying for the best score, based on how high you are able to get your climbers before the conditions force them to head back down. Death of a climber results in their score being reduced to zero, so K2 has an interesting Push-Your-Luck mechanic.

K2 could use a few rule refinements and some fixes to its iconography, but is generally a pretty good game.

A unique take on what is essentially a racing game, this one is just going up a mountain instead of racing around a track.  In some race car games if you push too hard your tires may explode, engine explode, well when pushing too hard to climb a mountain you can get fatigued and caught in storms.

Your two climbers will score points at the end of the game how far they climbed up the mountain as long as they are alive at the end of the game.  The higher you go, the peaks get narrower, air gets thinner, and weather gets nastier.

I enjoy the game and would love to try on another mountain peak, however, I am not drawn to the racing genre and feel if I want to play a racer, I might want a more traditional one.

A solid game that plays well and is a mostly-fair representation of what it must feel like to climb a mountain (at least from a planning perspective).

The game does suffer from a rather quick slide from "great" to just "good" the more you play it, however.

Finally, the easy side of the board and the "family" rules are a complete waste of your time as a gamer.  The only game worth playing is the difficult side of the board with the winter weather.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Following the line of realistic family games with a probably catastrophical ending is K2, a stylized but very effective recreation of an ascension of the infamous Himalayan peak by several groups of climbers (two groups per player). These have got to try and reach the highest possible point in the mountain and then either camp somewhere and try to survive or descend to a safer point on the lower end of the mountain/board.

The action is mostly driven by cards, some to regain strength and some to march on. Even though each player has their own deck, a turn with dud cards can affect the luckless player since their climbers will most probably become weaker through the influence of extra chips every turn (the player who plays the weakest cardsin the respective turn gets the most damage). Normally it's possible for a player to balance the energy left in both their expeditions if they're managed with common sense (not sending them all at the same time, for instance).

Beside the very evocative combination of mechanics and artwork, the most positive feature of this game (which can also be played on solitaire mode), is the way the difficulty level can be adjusted: there are two boards and the influence of the weather, represented with great success via "modular" tiles, can be increased or toned down by leaving out some of those tiles.

A game that really captures the live or die struggle to reach the peak of K2. You can play in summer conditions or for the really insane...you can play in winter. It pays to acclimatize extra well before you take off to the peak. However, it is a race and if the first one to reach the peak survives then he will win the game. If he survives...that is! The card play mechanic is excellent and very simple to understand. There is one dangerous day when you must use your remaining 3 cards before you can redraw...planning is essential because this usually occurs just before you are about to make that final leg to the top. Do you go for it and suffer losing your air or do you wait for a better draw of cards to choose from next day when you get 6 cards again?

The blocking rule just doesnt work for me.  Seems out of place in an otherwise very thematic game.

Game works much better with a tweaked blocking rule and is much more enjoyable to play.

RATING: 8
A game that rewards mathematical skills, planning, and a good sense of timing. Although it's a card-driven game,each player draws from his own small deck, identical to other players', making things much less arbitrary than is typical with cards. Once you've memorised the contents of the deck you can make much more informed decisions. The weather is a wild card element, but it's also foreseeable, so the skillful player will be able to make the most of meteorological windows of opportunity. The risk tokens are a very clever touch, ensuring that you want to move fast, but not too fast. Overall K2 does seem to evoke the feeling of climbing a mountain very well, as conditions get progressively less hospitable the closer to the peak you get.
The 2-sided easy/hard board and the choice between winter and summer weather add a lot of replayability.

A well themed game.  Played pretty quickly, not many rules.  I liked the feel of climbing a mountain, and the blocking and weather made for some very interesting decisions.  The risk for the biggest climber of the turn is also a nice to touch to screw with planning.  Seems like a good family game.

RATING: 7
A nice planning game. The aim is to get your 2 climbers as high up the mountain as you can (the higher, the more VPs) while staying alive. The latter is the tricky part. You get to go thru your own deck of cards 3 times in the game, which is made up of movement points and "stay alive" points, playing 3 cards a turn. You also accumulate "stay alive" points on the bottom spaces of the mountain, and these are needed because once you're halfway up the mountain you start losing them quickly, as a function of the spaces they're on, plus further loss via inclement weather (ie a progression of a marker thru weather cards which give notice of how many "stay alive" points will be further lost in each of the 4 weather bands on the mountain each turn). So a turn is to manage your hand to do small moves but get "stay alive" points, or do a series of big moves up the mountain and back down again into a safer zone before the "stay alive" points run out. The only real player interaction is a turn order effect. Only so many climbers can be in each space, and high up that number is one, so if someone ahead of you in turn order is likely to be going to the spot you were planning to go to, try and do something with your other climber instead. And plan your summitting for when you're first in turn order if you can. The game's a set 18 turns long which seems just the right length. The match of mechanics to theme is super. There are multiple difficulty levels (easy vs hard side, summer vs winter weather) but still, one hesitation I have is how many games you'll get out of it. With the low interaction, I think you'll be planning your hands and playing your climbers much the same way from game to game (ie keep your big moving cards and play them in combinations, etc). Still, good fun and good decisions to make each game until then.

Very nice game, quick to explain and get hold of but a lot of depth to the things you have to manage.

At first I thought the fixed board would be a limiting factor and lead to over familiarity in approach before I realised that everything else is variable and that's where the variety will come in.

A very tight game where you have to adapt your approach to other players and the turn of the cards - and even then your success isn't guaranteed

Based on one play: A light game where you move two climbers up to the top of K2, but must ensure that they do not die from the cold and harsh air. You play three cards in a turn, moving your players or giving them better conditions. The weather also changes, but you can always see at least three turns ahead. Fun and simple.

RATING: 6
I really enjoyed this when I first bought it, but my enthusiasm has dropped somewhat since then. This is a push you luck card game that is simple enough that you could call it a gateway game. Especially since the way it tends to play out; the start of the game is easy as you are at the base camp of K2 and your climbers are acclimatising to their conditions, this allows new players to get a handle on the mechanics before the mountain starts to fight back, later still, near the peak, the players start to get into each other’s way, which, if played aggressively can end in the death, or near death of a climber or two.

The rising tension and way that both of your climbers score for the highest point they get to make this a fun gateway game. I kind of wish it played a little faster (within 45 mins) as I feel that it would fill a better niche in the market, and my collection that way.

K2 follows the typical path for race games: you're trying to be the first to the finish line (here, the top of the mountain), but if you push too hard, you'll experience hazards (death).  The interesting thing here is that you aren't penalized for speed, but instead for altitude.  You can climb back down the mountain to avoid those hazards, keeping the points you got for reaching the top.  Your final score if the combined maximum altitude reached by your two teams, assuming they are still alive.  It's got some interesting concepts if you're into race games, but myself, I'm not a huge fan of the genre.  Also, I found the limited occupancy of spots to be very strange--whoever heard of traffic jams while mountain climbing?

Have played 2 player game just twice.

I thought the theme was woven into the game very well.  You feel like you're climbing a mountain and are very concerned for your life, which impacts the decisions you make.  It factors in weather conditions, adds risk for being too aggressive, and the idea that as you get higher there are fewer and smaller places to stop and rest.  The tension really builds.  

Interesting to see replayability, and how it works with more players?

Upon hearing the rules, I expected the game to be somewhat dry and mechanical.  It surpassed my expectations.  I found myself engaged with the theme, and my nerves were on edge as I hoped my climbers would survive the harsh weather and high altitudes.

Still, this is not a game I would expect to play frequently, as much of its fun stems from its novelty factor.

One bad artwork decision - with some adjacent spaces, it is hard to determine which spaces are higher and which are lower.  On a couple particular spots, the ropes appear to angle one way and the relative height of the circles suggest the opposite.

Mechanics and theme blend together about as well as any game. Very little down time as players manage hand/select actions simultaneously.

This is a game where you budget your movement cards and your oxygen levels to try to get the most points by havign your two meeples scale the mountain. There's some fun in trying to make sure you don't die, but there are too few scoring opportunities for this to be really special. There are also some graphic design problems in that a lot of the information about the different spaces of the board get obscured by player's meeples as they sit in the spaces. It's also confusing that it costs 1 movement per space where there is no number printed, and 2 movement per space where 2 IS printed. Every space should have the movement information.

I was really impressed by this quick resource-management mountain-climbing game. Playing out your cards to get to the top while staying alive is very puzzle-like, but that’s not to say it’s multiplayer solitaire as there is potential for some really nasty blocking. The weather forecast gives a nice strategic look-ahead while the ‘risk’ system does just enough to ensure that you can’t plan perfectly. The only minor complaint I have is that the turn order can be crucial, but it just rotates round the table. I’d have preferred a player-driven turn order.

This is a very good game that is short to play.

Of the 4 scenarios, played both the easiest one and the hardest one once each.

The hard scenario is only hard if you send someone to the top, because they are very likely to die.  Otherwise it is not hard.

I dove in with a passing knowledge of the rules, and as such the game was a real farce, in all the best ways. Not understanding that 'Pitch a tent' didn't just mean 'end your turn' I put up both my tents at the base camp, and as such made the decision to only send Smooth up the mountain, trailing most of the way behind Raf's climbers. In the end Smooth died, leaving his bereaving wife to the horndog Squiggly, and Raf's climbers both succumbed to insufficient acclimation. 

So at a roaring five points I won with my sole survivor. We're both eager to play the game again, and in comparison to sibling game 'The Cave' this one comes out much stronger.

An interesting theme and the game reminds me of Ice Flow, in being a puzzle game but the interaction is really limited. If you'd take out the blocking mechanic (in the light version) the game can be played solitaire and would be completely the same. I have yet to try the hard version, but until then I cannot see myself ever really wanting to play this game.

First impressions after 2 plays: wonderful game with enough difficulty settings to tune it accordingly to various groups of players. Played it with my wife and we had a blast (so far summer weather and easier route). It's a bit mathy at the top of the mountain, but changing weather tiles and semi-random card drafting provides a lot of excitement.

Solid 8, though I feel the score will go up after I play it on higher difficulty settings.

UPDATE: Down to 7, some replayability issues, hard (if not impossible) to catch up if one of your climbers dies.

Always enjoy these brain draining puzzle-like games. Quite a bit of tension estimating how far you can go with the threat of oxygen depletion hanging over you. Great art and with experienced players this can be done in well under an hour. Nice touch with the various game boards too.

RATING: 7.5
I absolutely love this. Typically games that try to marry an indepth theme with good gameplay end up coming short in one or the other. Either they're a bit too abstract to capture the theme, or the theme overrules the fun gameplay. Luckily, K2 balances both out. There's enough game there that you'll get plenty of absolutely nailbiting situations - weather, risk, your height at the time, nearest tent, can two climbers fit on a ledge or not - it's all there. The rules are simple enough, but not in a way that the game feels too simple at any point.

Also, being a rock climber, it just adds to everything. This is definitely one of the biggest surprises for me in a while as I expected much less. 

EDIT: Lowered the rating a bit after more games - not a bad game, definitely has tight moments every game which are life or death gambles, but ultimately there's not an incredible amount of breadth in the game, even with the expansion. Still, you'll breeze a 3 or 4 player game in about an hour so it's very much bang for your buck all the way.

In essence a hand management game. Set in the backdrop of the world's deadliest mountain. Go watch "Vertical Limit" of a similar show before you play this game. Trust me. Then you will really appreciate what they mean by the "death zone". Also, set your air conditioner to the lowest temperature to enhance the game play. Yes. There is no limit to how much you can "pimp" a game experience.

Component Quality:
Good. This is a good looking game with high quality components, however I am completely stumped by the high cost of the game compared to what comes in the box. Besides the double-sided board there's not a lot pieces here.

Gameplay:
This is one of the few games I can play multiple times in a row. Turns are fast and the end game is extremely tense. There's a definite push-your-luck element to the game if you decide to rush up the mountain. You can plan ahead for the weather condition, so there's always the option to play safe, but the player that wins is often the one who takes chances. It's almost more fun to lose in K2 as you reach the mountains peak and realize you can't survive the climb down.

This is a super difficult to survive the go round.  Knowing the cards is extremely helpful..actually crucial.  This is an interesting game.  I'm not sure it's all that fun but if you like crunching numbers than this might be up your ally because the game is tight. One really good thing going for this is that the setup and break down is really quick and its easy enough the learn and remember especially with the player aid so it can be easily picked up and played. I'm sure this rating will be very viscous with more plays.   

Second time around this was a quick game that is a little more intriguing than I first thought.  I have to say the more plays the more it draws you back.

Third play, harder side got 16 points my best score.  This is a good game that Imagine with others is more a solo trip but there is some blocking. If you like number crunching games that have low conflict then this might be a game you will enjoy.As a solo game which is my main purpose for this game then I'd say it's very good .  Sets up and breaks down quickly and the game is intriguing hopefully the game play will be variable enough to last.

RATING: 7.85
Fun and easy to play. The game involves playing movement cards to move up a mountain, and oxygen cards to keep your climbers alive in the higher reaches and worst weather. The luck element is very low without being restricted and the game comes in a variety of difficulty levels. Player interaction is present but not overly competitive, and though it would be accessible to non-gamers it still has a strong strategic element (am seriously considering this as a boardgame for Christmas for the family).

RATING: 8.5
This is a game that I've had my eye on for a long time. It's perhaps the best theme-to-gameplay game I've ever played. It really feels like you're climbing a mountain and losing a climber really does hurt.
The solo game is awesome too and feels like a mathematical puzzle.
The only quarrel I have with the game is that in the last few turns you can really get screwed high up the mountain. Turn order really plays too big a part here, which can suck pretty much.

This is the so-called gateway game that would have made me turn my back on this hobby if I'd been introduced to it that way...

The rules are elegant and streamlined, but that is about as complimentary as I can go. You are just adding and subtracting a bunch of numbers, round after round, moving ever so slowly your dudes up and down the trails, while glancing at the weather forecast. Boring.

To add insult to injury, arbitrary rules make unintentional blocking and semi-random 'risk' penalties a frustrating experience. If you are going to have such rules in a multiplayer game they should feel like player interaction and not the game playing against you under the disguise of being the result of 'players choices'.

And don't get me started on the ethical conundrum of a deadly race where it is every player for themselves, literally. Great example to introduce to non-gamers (then again Risk and Monopoly are not exactly models of good conduct).

Part of the appeal of the game is the ability to scale the difficulty (two board sides, two sets of weather cards for 4 possibilities).  Probably to appeal to the family market has a couple of tweaks for an easier game (safety card as well as increased stacking in certain zones with 5 players) which can be dropped for most gamers.  A nice theme of racing up the mountain and hoping to survive.  Go for big moves (and hope you have the physical ability to last) or make small moves, resting along the way to recover.  Nicely done.

13-07-2014. Rated after one play. Highly abstracted mechanics on a very thematic game. Players perform a slow race to the top of k2 with 2 mountaineers. Players have to take into account weather conditions, the condition of their mountaineers to judge/hope to survive the mountain. I died with both my guys on the same turn.

Not a bad game, but not great either, probably just good. I think the integration of theme and mechanics is brilliant,  but I feel overall the game is a little to slow and fiddly with maintenance of weather and physical condition. Artwork is good, components a little flimsier than I would've liked

Only played online so far.  Tentative rating.  It's an interesting race game with pauses, where you have to decide when do you have the cards and weather to risk making your push to the top - it feels a little like a lighter, more thematic version of Lewis and Clark.  Definitely needs more plays to see if there a potential problem where if someone gets the right cards early on with good weather, they can push up high right away and then there's little point for the other players to continue.  The risk tokens try to serve as a catch-up mechanic.

RATING: 9
Nagyon erős taktikai játék. Szorongató döntések sokaságát kell meghozni. Másszak, vagy inkább aklimatizálódjak? Ha mászok, akkor felfelé, vagy lefelé érdemes egyáltalán indulni? A szerencse szerepe nem elhanyagolható, de hát így van ez jól, hiszen a hegyek legyőzéséhez a felkészültség mellett azért az is kell. Kulcsfontosságú a pozíciók blokkolása, de ugyanakkor koránt sem biztos, hogy az egy helyben toporgás a célravezető. A kicsit is rutinosabb játékosok ellen semmi esélye a kezdőknek.
Teljesen egyedi a hand managment mechanika, jól találkozik a tematika és a játékbeli döntések feszültsége. A solo verzió szerintem jóval nehezebb, mint a több fős, de majd próbálok gyakorolni :)
Nagy előnye még, hogy a szabályok egyszerűek, könnyen, gyorsan és jól magyarázható a játék. Valamint külön kiemelném, hogy a játék doboz (elsősorban ami a vastagságát illeti) mérete ideaális (ritka ez a mai világban).

The theme alone sells this game for me. I'm a member of an alpine mountaineering organization in the Pacific Northwest. I'm not an active climber, but I've taken the organization's basic climbing program. A lot of our friends however are active climbers. So it's fun to play a game like this that is thematically relevant to us.

In addition to that, the play mechanics are great. You really have to watch yourself and not get overconfident. More than one of climbing teams in this game has bagged the summit, only to die a short while later.

great, great game. Kind of like a co-op and competitive put together, in that you fight against the game as well as race each other. Others' daring deeds encourages you to push higher than you should, which inevitably results in death. thematic tension & excitement, yet mostly playing side by side eurostyle, not in each other's faces. a real game accomplishment.

love the different maps. Have all 4 mountains & the avalanche, great stuf. Play with the op. rules that you do 1 final acclimitization check at the game end, and lose points to go down to base camp @ game end (1pt per mountain level above 5000ft), makes it feel more realistic.

RATING: 5.5
A rather good and simple optimization game with a cool theme. I find it better with fewer players, as blocking each other's way with a full table makes for a more chaotic and a bit frustrating game. If you must, consider a home rule where mountaineers of multiple players may share a spot at the expense of additional movement points. Unfortunately, after I had my fun with it, I no longer want to play it - each play is quite similar to the previous one. This can be to some extent mitigated by the expansion, of course.

RATING: 6
What boardgames should be - dripping with theme and less pushing little cubes around. This is good planning and luck pushing up the mountain, and it really feels like you're pushing and planning your way up a mountain avoiding bad weather, grabbing optimal positions on the face and all the time racing against the clock.

Fun game with the easy family side of the board with easy weather conditions, then there's the longer and more difficult side with really tough weather - good stuff.

My only gripe is that climbers should have to descend the mountain (to some level at least), before the end of the game too. Leaving them hanging at the top near death seems hardly like a winning position.

Player interaction comes from blocking and being blocked from optimal (sometimes essential) positions on the mountain, and more significantly by the bidding for taking the most risk on a turn. Plans can often be tight, so the collection of a risk token at the wrong time can lead to death.

The game could best be described as euro dungeoncrawl - only it's on a mountain. It's about risk taking, but doesn't feel like risk taking game - part hand management (quite nice) and part dealing with the situation and weather circumstances.

The good part: the theme is immersive and original. The downside - no interaction (well some blocking, but, meh). It makes sense in terms of mountaineering - it's a solitary activity. For a MPS, I'll take Thunderstone please.

2012: 9. I really love the theme of this game, and the mechanics really do an excellent job of serving that theme.  Getting to the top and back down alive takes some careful planning, just like real life. (or so I understand) There's some great tension in the game play as you balance risk with speed.  And the components are beautiful, evoking the bright colours of mountain climbing gear against the stark blues and greys of a cold environment.

I've heard two critiques - that the game doesn't have much replay value once you know the best route and how to use your cards; and someone can sprint to the top on the final "day" of the game and score points without having to move back down again. I haven't played the game enough to experience the first, and the second seems like a valid complaint but have not seen it in practice. I think it could easily be house ruled by requiring climbers to be below a certain elevation or safely in a tent by game end, or have one additional oxygen check at the end of the game.

2015: 10. Upgraded, been playing this game a lot more lately, and I still love it.  It's beautiful to look at, elegant mechanics that really make you feel the theme of the game. A big plus that it's easy to teach!

I've only played this game twice, yet it's already in my Top 50! I just realized it is available to play online, so I'm going to have to check it out as it didn't go over as well as I had hoped with my group. I really dig it though. There are not many games like it - you're trying to reach as high as you can on the mountain, but it's all for nothing unless you can survive to make it back down. You have to manage your hand of cards to plan for the upcoming weather and make sure you don't get yourself trapped in someone by other climbers. Such a neat game!

Always starts out slow and simple - but gets really tough when you're all at the top of the mountain just trying to hang on and maneuver around each other. Took a few plays to grow on me.... but I quite like this game. The Broad Peak is an excellent expansion as well.

It's a fairly challenging simulation of the harsh conditions, and greatly enjoyable to play. We have however taken to playing with the house rule that after round 18, you still have to make it down to the base camp alive in order to keep your points.

Egyedi játékmenet, nagyon szép megvalósítás. A K2 csúcs megmászása a témája ennek a társasjátéknak. Nagyon jól sikerült eltalálni a játék kinézetét és hangulatát. Tényleg olyan a játék közben az ember érzése a szép tábla miatt, mintha ott fagyoskodna éppen a hegyen és keresné a legjobb utat felfelé a társával. Ugyanis minden játékos két hegymászót irányít. A túrát két dolog, az időjárás és az akklimatizálódás befolyásolja. 18 darab kártyából hat van mindig a kézben, abból választ minden játékos hármat minden körben, amivel le-fel tud mászni, illetve akklimatizálódni. Az időjárásra figyelve kell jó időben megkezdeni a csúcs meghódítását. Jó helyre kell lerakni az egy-egy sátort is, ami segít a körülmények elviselésében. Egyszerű, inkább családi játék a K2 a könnyű szabályai miatt, bár többfajta nehézségi elemet építettek a játékba. Zordabb időjáráskártyák és kétoldalas tábla, mind az újrajátszhatósági faktorát növeli a társasnak. További előnye a játéknak, hogy minden megadott játékosszámmal ugyanazt a hangulatot hozza.

Fun card management puzzle where you are trying to play against your environment and the upcoming events.  More players means a bit chaos at the top, but all in all a nice clean system that has you wondering if you are going to make it or not.  There is a bit of tension as you are pushing your limits and hoping the card flop goes in your favor.

Fun game solo.
Nice thinky preparations of going up the mountain, with some randomness of weather and climber's strength and oxygen. Theme fits quite well with gameplay.

Advanced Side during winter is BRUTAL.
Sunny side during the spring is more calm and pleasant.
Both equal lots of replays.

Really cool game that is pretty thematic in simulating some of the perils of mountain climbing.  I like how you have to balance your cards and the locations of your climbers, all while checking the weather ahead.  A must on higher difficulties; I think that a good weather game on the easy side of the board would be far too easy.

UPDATE: Certainly a solid game, and definitely thematic. This is a great family game, but Mount Everest is definitely a much more gamery game.

1 play, 2er

A good, tense, hand- and risk-management game. Try to get your 2 climbers as high as possible _and survive_, dealing with the weather and space limits (higher on the mountain, need to spend more acclimatization points). If you like hand management games like Snow Tails, this could be right up your alley!

--- Summary ---
- The board (easy/hard sides) shows paths up the mountain, divided into several bands of elevation. The spaces show different movement points and acclimatization penalties. 2 climbers/player start at the mountain base.
- 2 weather tiles, showing forecast for next 6 days
- penalty chits 0-2; shuffle face down, flip 3 face up
- Players have the same set of cards: mostly climbing (1-3, some with different up/down numbers), some acclimatization (0-6). Start with a hand of 6.
- Each player has a personal board to track each climber's acclimatization level (1-10) separately.

Play in clockwise order each round, then start player rotates. Everyone selects then reveals 3 cards; player with highest sum (green = movement cards) takes a penalty chip (lowest number) and must deduct that number from movement of acclimatization of either of their climbers. In turn order, assign your cards to one/both of your climbers (blue/acclimatization cards advance that climber on their acclimatization track. Use movement points to climb and/or place tent (each climber has one available for the game). At the end of your movement, may not exceed the space limits of that space (varies by player count and elevation). Advance that climber's score marker to track the highest elevation it has reached.

After everyone has moved, adjust acclimatization points from each climber (deduct for space on path and weather; +1 if at one of your own tents). If >6, reduce to 6. If

Played it once. I don't particularly like race games. I don't even like cold sports like alpinism. I'm obviously biased but I really didn't like K2. Plus, I was playing with 5 players and got to play last. What happened was that when it was my turn to play I didn't have any space left where to end my movement so I didn't play actually. To bad to be truth I know but in the end (as if the game was played to the end which was not) I was very happy for not buying the game. 

Too bad for my tastes although I admit it has some nice relevant ideas and cute components. The damage mechanic for the players who play better movement cards doesn't seem to work out but it could be a good mechanic if used in a different logic. 

Anyway, if you're like me keep away from this game. If you're not, please try it but add a bit of salt - it could help you with all that ice!

A gripping game about climbing the most dangerous peak in the world. Not only is the board trying to kill you, but if you get high enough to lock in a lot of points, the other players can do their best to strand you on a high ledge that you can't acclimate to fast enough. I found myself referring to my climbers in the first person afterwards, and almost broke out into a sweat when I thought my climber was going to die after reaching the summit.

RATING: 8.5
I have an unending fascination with humans in extremis, and I've read books and watched documentaries on a couple of the more tragic Everest expeditions of recent decades.  With what little mountaineering knowledge I've gained from that, I will boldly state that K2 has succeeded with its thematic integration whilst maintaining a fairly minimal amount of rules more than any other game I can think of.  But it's more than just a thematic "experience" game; it's a fantastic mental puzzle with a very adjustable level of challenge (hooray for double-sided game boards!!).  BUT it's more than just a multi-player solitaire puzzle exercise; the race against their opponents and for the limited space on the mountain forces players to push themselves to the very limits of life in order to emerge the victor.  This is the "push your luck" game (with resource management) that I've been waiting for: one that doesn't get bogged down with fiddly rules, while still providing plenty of tense and challenging decisions every snowy step of the way.  (But rather than rush out and purchase it, I'm going to be patient and hold out for the next iteration, "Mount Everest", to be released.)  From a components point of view, everything is top-notch, and the illustrations on all the game materials are beautifully done.  My only little niggle would be that the numbers on the "topless Oreo cookie" spaces of the mountain locations can become quickly obscured when more than 1 or 2 climbers get into a space.  On the whole, it's an extremely clever (and tense and challenging and exciting and fun...) game.  I like it.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Clever, very mature game. Theme and mechanics are almost perfectly blended. Gamesystem is quite simple, yet not trivial, what becomes obvious during the play — a player must plan moves wisely, manage his actions in advance. With many variants and solo play this game may last for long.
Edit: After some plays game fades. In some variants first moves are a bit bland, and the fact you may not descend from the mountain and WIN is a bit ridiculous… :)

Well produced race/blocking game, albeit with something of a retro look. I'm told gameplay matches mountaineering, but what would I know?

RATING: 6
A játék tetszik, elég sok stratégia van benne, mikor hol legyek, és emellett az időjárást is figyelni kell. Összeségében véve jó. 

Azonban számomra ellentmondás van a játékban: ott fönt olyan magasan a hegymászók biztos nem blokkolják egymást inkább segítik és ez a játékbanpont forítva van. A másik amit el kell fogadni: ha valaki bebetonozza magát a csúcs alatti mezőn, akkor - ha a második hegymászójával nem csinál nagy butaságot, megnyerte a játékot. Na persze kérdés hogy be tudja-e magát betonozni a csúcs alatti mezőn: ehhez azért szerencse és kedvező időjárás is kell.

update: ez a bebetonozós taktika megöli a játékélményt . Dugó lesz fent és mindenki arra vár, hogy aki fent van elveszítse a bábuját.

I guess hikers don't block another hikers so such high level, but help together in real life. In game this is reverse, but I know this is important to this game. In spite of this small theoretical error, the game is enjoyable.

K2 is a hard family game, or an easy gamers game (the dark board, winter cards). The theme is original. As higher your mountaneer, the more points you have. Your total score are the points for your two mountaineers. So when one is very high, but the second very low, you will have not many points. 

The interesting thing is the acclimatization. Your mountanieers have "health points", when someones are 0, than the mountaineer will be dead and you lose his points. So you can climb very carefull, have not so many points, but has the points, or climb very fast, score more points, but risk to lose them.

Érdekes kis játék. 

Elsőre nem tudtam hova tenni. Mindenki dícsérte és azok akikkel játszottam azok is nagy rajongói voltak. És egyáltalán nem azt kaptam, amire számítottam.

Leginkább a Niagara-ra hasonlít nekem. Itt a hegy tetejére kell eljutni és visszaereszkedni. Kicsivel több a kártyád de ugyanúgy egy megadott csomagból gazdálkodsz. Itt mindig csak 6 kártyát látsz, és abból használhatsz 3-at. Ebben kicsit Dominion érzés, de persze itt nem lehet paklit építeni és átviszed amit nem használtál.

Igazi családi játék, bár a téma választás talán kicsit erős a kategóriához.

K2 is lots of fun, with excellent marriage of mechanics and theme. Even if it's a game about timing and hand management, the game [i]feels[/i] like a push-your-luck game, but one that disperses its push-your-luck decisions over multiple mechanics.

The primary mechanic is deck of cards that you must manage in order to quickly and intelligently navigate your two climbers up the side of the mountain. Each round you get a hand of cards from your personal deck. Each player has the same deck, but gets a different hand of cards. Cards allow you to either move your climbers up or down the mountain, or stay put while recovering some of their health. Move too slowly or too quickly and you can find yourself caught unprepared for harsh weather that will drain, and possibly kill, one or both of your people. That said, it's still a race. You'll want to reach the peak, if possible, for maximum points -- but at some point you'll want to find your way back down before the harsh conditions take their toll.

Added to the mix are tents that allow you to set up a permanent safe (or at least safer) spot on the board, weather reports that fluctuate from turn to turn making things more or less difficult for people at certain elevations, and the threat of what I like to call "hotdog points." Whenever you play the highest numbered combination of cards for the round, you are forced to take a penalty point that somehow hampers your climbers. This is supposed to represent the taking of unnecessary risk. Really it feels exactly like what it is: a mechanical throttle to rein in players who might jump out to an insurmountable lead. This is also a light push-your-luck element that you'll want to manage. It's enough of a threat to warrant consideration, but never so harsh that it will kill your chances of making progress.

Overall, K2 is a fine package of a game. There are options to customize the experience, making it more or less difficult depending on your group's preferences. The cards, weather, and two-sided board add variety. And the game plays quickly without overstaying its welcome. While playing, I certainly felt the pressure of trying to climb what some have labeled the most dangerous peak. There is even the threat of player elimination if you get unlucky or simply manage your climb poorly.

If anything, I wanted to like the game more than I did. Something about it felt a bit too unfocused, as if I was looking for a game that was more of a pure race. What K2 is actually about, however, is... well... to be honest, I haven't quite figured it out. There are a lot of overlapping systems that feel fun, that feel meaningful, but that also obfuscate the heart of a game that feels as though it should be straightforward. I don't know -- maybe that's a good thing. Maybe K2 is more robust than I give it credit for, and that certainly intrigues me enough to keep playing.

This is a logistics puzzle with low-level simultaneous action selection on top. I mean "low level" in the fact that what everyone picks isn't often fatal to your turn, but it still requires consideration.

It is also a race game with the twist that you don't have to be the first to cross the finish line, but you have to be fast and you also have to safely stop your car and at least have it safely heading for the garage. It is an innovative take on racing games and also heavily thematic.

In some board games people "get it" about half way through, but I think K2 takes an entire play for it to click.

No luck card management game, dripping in theme and keeping you interested for the duration. 

That's close to a winning combo, but for the theme not being equally interesting to all people. The mechanics themselves are mathematical so they're unlikely to draw someone in. 

The game lacks somewhat in replayability, as even though each game develops differently, in the end the experience is more or less the same.

To sum it up, if you're even remotely interested in climbing you'll love this game, but if you're not, you take your chances.

A very nice,unique game.  I'm not normally interested in racing games, but I love this game.  Simple enough for a non-gamer to learn, but deep enough for a gamer to enjoy.  It doesn't take that long to play either.  This game just keeps finding its way to the table.  This is one of our most played games.  We love introducing friends to it and watching them die on the mountain for the first time!

I didn't know anything about this game going into, and I was a little hesitant after hearing it was a "race game" which I typically don't enjoy, but it's not your typical race game.

You have a personal deck of cards most of which have movement values on them, and some of them have acclimation values. You draw a hand of six and then simultaneously decide which three to play. Some of the movement cards have an alternate "downward movement" value, which is only applicable when coming down the mountain. When cards are revealed you tally up the movement values (but not the downward movement values) and the person who has the most movement value has to take a penalty tile which will decrease something he does this round.

On your turn you play your three cards, spending them between your two meeples and then draw another three cards. The goal of the game is to get to the top of the mountain with both meeples and then... live.

Each spot on the mountain costs some movement value to move into, and most of the higher ones will decrease your acclimation track one or two levels. You have an acclimation track for each of your guys, that ranges from 1 to 10, but at the end of your turn you'll always drop down to at least 6. There's also a weather track that makes certain rounds cost more to move or lowers your acclimation score if you're above x meters. You can always see the weather for at least the next three rounds. If you ever have to drop your acclimation level down from one, that guy dies.

You can also spend movement points to build a base. You have to spend a number of points equal to the movement cost of the space you're in. But from that point on, you have a base where either or both of your guys can use. Bases just increase your acclimation level one level. Which can be a lifesaver.

Your score at the end of the game is the sum of the points according to how high each of your guys reached (if they lived). In case of ties, it's who got the furthest first.

The game was fun, trying to figure out how to best manage your hand and make due with what you got. Choosing three from six gives you a little wiggle room, but when you get to the end of your deck, you don't draw again until you play the last three cards in your hand. So you have to usually plan, not only what you'll do this turn, but what you're likely to do next turn. The threat of dying is a very real thing and you have to be very careful. This game reminded me a lot of Tavarua even though the theme is very different.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=73761][/thing] is a game in which the players represent a team of two climbers in the endeavor of climbing the dangerous K2. The dynamic of the game is: managing your hand of cards - every turn (except the one before the shuffling of the deck) you will have 6 cards to choose from. You must select 3 to use every round. There are two types of cards: ropes and aclimatisation. With the ropes cards you can go up or down the mountain. The aclimatisation cards allow the climber to survive the harsh weather conditions and the altitude of the mountain.

The highest the climber gets, the more points it will be worth. But, higher the effects of the altitude and weather are worst and if the climber dies, you will only get one point, no matter how high he/she reached. Thus is necessary to control the need to go up with the necessity of keeping the climbers alive.

The game comes with markers that indicates how is the weather for the round (it can make movement tougher, or the effects of the altitude even worst). Also the player that used the highest sum of movement (rope cards) will suffer some penalty (for movement or aclimatisation).

Therefore [thing=73761][/thing] requires that the players manage the advance of the climbers, evaluating the risks, rewards and possibilities - since timming can be key, as near the top of the mountain simply there isn't enough space for everyone, so blocking other or be blocked will happen often - and is one of the great fun of the game, just sit there while the climber below just can't go further because of you!

[thing=73761][/thing] is a straightforward game, with interesting decisions, a nice level of player interaction with a lot of room for screwage among the players. I liked it quite a bit!

Really like this game- have to say it's one of my favorite first time plays ever. Thematically tight, easy scoring system, lots of things going on that you have to think about. Just enough unknowns and luck to keep you guessing. I'm glad my intuition was right on the fact that I'd like this game...

Some interesting ideas here, especially around aclimatisation.  However it is too easy to get blocked by players who just don't have the right cards to move out of your way, this is obviously worse higher up the mountain, and must happen all the time on the hard board.  Dying near the top of the mountain because another player draws the wrong cards for 3 turns is not good.  Let alone how hard this must be if players intentionally try to mess you up !

K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. 
You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.

The game that fires Ave Cesar. Rules are just as simple, but the suspense brought about by taking risks regarding recuperation points and other players' moves make this a much better game. Also, the opportunity to block climbers who made it to the top before you can make this game pretty mean. Different weather conditions and a double-sided board ensure replayability. Probably best with a large number of players (5).
UPDATE: Played with two and had a very good time. Apparently, the game scales pretty well!

Holy cow, I have never played a game this punishing. Perhaps it was my first plays but the acclimatization deductions are just plain brutal. There aren't that many postive cards to acclimate, but even with lousy timing, you are most certainly get smacked around. The game hinges on looking and planning ahead based on the weather patterns. However, turn order is critical. If you get trapped below while planning to move ahead, then you can get hemmed in, which can potentially be lethal. The game is good but truly brutal. I also acknowledge the complaints from others: 1) Being trapped and unable to go up or down due to maximum occupancy per locale. The work around of +1 movement and -1 acclimatization as payment to move up and share the spot may have to be implemented. 2) Suicide rush to claim top spot in the final round. Work around is to score bonus points for moving down. 3) Start player should be player that had the highest movement points.

Rating is unclear at this stage pending additional plays. OK game but not for the faint of heart.

Played 4 times, had a lot of fun each time, especially with the harder difficulties, the fear of losing a mountaineer always behind the corner... But me and my friends found out  that the best strategy is to use one climber at a time: bring one to the top and then back to safety, then do the same with the other one. It is quite the opposite of real life, where climbers are supposed to go together and help each other... besides this, it is a challenging game and I like it!

PERMANENT PLACE IN THE COLLECTION AS A NON-GAMERS GAME.

UPDATE: K2 is pretty 'meh', but it has the rare quality of being easy to teach while delivering a decent strategic play experience. For this reason, despite being pretty 'meh', this will get repeatedly introduced to non-gamer friends. Rules explanations are easy. It is basically 'you are climbing a mountain. You play cards to acclimatise and move. It gets harder as you go up. The weather changes each turn. You can pitch tents.'

First impressions are that this is a strategic, tactical and slightly weird euro game with a strong theme. Not nail-bitingly exciting, but solid. Our first game was with easy weather and the easy board. Our climbers got named Wiggleman and Smoothy.

Initial score 7.5. May revise up or down with further plays.

K2 is a fairly simple hand management game. You go through your deck of cards three times, trying to time up your card expenditures in the most efficient way possible, while dealing with the weather conditions and terrain demands. It's an interesting puzzle to play solo, just to see if you can get to the top of the mountain.

That of course gets old relatively quickly. Fortunately, playing with others really opens things up. With opponents racing you up the mountain, no longer can you simply wait and build super efficient hands. Sometimes you have to move before you want to, in order to cut off another team. Sometimes you have to turn back, just to drop a tent to help your second climber, since every altitude level gained is scoring important points in a competitive game. All of this makes it quite the brain burner, despite its simple rule set.

Initially reluctant to play a mountain climbing themed game, but discovered a surprisingly fun and tense game.  Easy to learn and very thematic.  With more players congestion can form at higher elevations which frustrate attempts to go higher still.  Surviving a trek to the highest elevations requires careful planning and good card draws.  The ever-changing weather is a great feature that makes good planning even more difficult.

Each player controls a team of two climbers in a card driven race of point-to-point movement to the top of K2 mountain. Light weight family or gateway strategy game that involves tradeoffs; aggressively send one climber to the top knowing the chances of freezing to death, or be sure and safe bringing the team up together and climatizing along the way. Mind the weather forecast when planning the ascent of your team to key elevations. The most daring team will suffer set backs from taking excessive risks.

Een spel waarin de spelers bergbeklimmers zijn en de befaamde top van de K2 proberen te bereiken.

Dit spel heeft geen geweldige indruk op mij achtergelaten. Het voelt nogal repetitief aan. Iedere beurt spelen de spelers 3 van hun 6 handkaarten uit en deze kaarten betekenen of klimmen (dan wel dalen) of acclimatiseren. De kaarten zijn dermate hetzelfde dat mij al na een paar rondjes een erg repititief gevoel opdrong. Bovendien was de interactie tussen de spelers echt minimaal.

Geen hoogvlieger voor mij.

Brrr...it's bitingly cold, the wind hurts like an ice-whip and the silence screams in my head...

I have never been mountain climbing, much to my own shame. However, this game does give me the sense that I am trying to achieve the goal of 'conquering' that bitter, beautiful beast known as K2. The theme of this game is well integrated into the decisions. 

The game board is not just a pretty place to score...it is a functional piece of game-play that is used in conjunction with cards to round out a gaming experience in mountain climbing that plays in a decent evening's time, and satisfies for a clean mental challenge.

We really enjoy this game, the challenge, and the beauty of the board. The competition to best another player against the confrontation of natural elements makes K2 a unique and entertaining game.

Its a creative game, and stays really true to the theme of mountain climbing. But, it just lacks a bit of the "fun" factor. There is little player interaction and the rules aren't the most clear or easy to understand and learn the game from.

Love the theme of this one. Climbing up the mountain K2. The higher you go the more challenging things become. 

It's great that the game comes with two sides on the one board. An easier and harder climb. Also liked the ability to choose either winter or summer before you start the game, to set the difficulty level.

I didn't like the fact that once you reach the top with one of your groups, that you can basically just let them die and not suffer any consequences in the end scoring. It's an obvious tactic so to avoid wasting more movement points on that group, as they have already scored you the 10 points.

The game is very simple at heart and that may effect the games replay-ability. 

A good game but maybe not enough meat on this one to make me want to keep it.

An exciting race. I enjoy it more with 3 people than solo or two but every option has its pluses. Great game, very portable (without the box). Interaction is best closer to the top but bidding offers much mind-reading and strategic bluffing.
For newbies, i suggested an oxygen aided variant (see K2 forum). It's a v. appealing gateway.

A generous gift from FTL Secret Santa with Lovable Eyes!

Fun game but about 1 out of 4 times you can really get screwed by card draws.  I'm still trying to figure out how to house rule something to resolve it...

A great game which can be ruined by unfortunate card draws in the final draw. This prevents it from being rated even higher.

hand managment race game up a mountain... interesting and fun, but having one of your climbers die just means you probably can't win, which deflates the fun a bit near the end...

I really like this game when I space out the plays.  Its different and challenging even at the easier settings due to the restrictions on how many can be in a space. This is not a game that I immedinatally want to play again afterwards though.

“Probably will play it some day again, but then we must play it on the harder level. I guess it will be interesting and fun then.”, with these words, I ended my first review. We weren’t very enthusiastic about this game, but we had the feeling that we were missing something. I mean, to us it seemed like everybody was crazy about this game, and our reaction was something like: “Oh, it’s OK, but this is it?” Then we got the chance to play it again, and as said in the original review, we played the harder level. After playing we felt this game deserved a new review, and that’s why these articles starts with the letters BGrR, or Board Game re-Review.

For the second time, we set up the game, and started to play. The rules of the game are very easy to understand and to explain. The rulebook is very clear about them. Basically the game is like this.

    Draw 3 more cards into your hand.
    Pick 3 cards out of you hand (3 out of 6)
    Do your actions
    Check your condition
    Move on to the next round

That really is all there is. Where the first time we played, this became a problem to us when we were half way the game, now it wasn’t a problem at all. We just had a hard time, to make sure the climbers stayed alive. If there is one advice we can give to players, it would be: “Don’t play the easy side, and don’t use the family rules!!!” Those will ruin the game! Just play the difficult side, and have lots of fun. You’ll notice that it really is hard to reach the top, and it’s even harder to come down alive again.

This is a good, suspenseful, risk management game, with a feel unlike much of anything else.  If you're at least decent at card-counting, you will merely have to bank on the odds of getting the cards you need when you need them; however, timing that against the weather and your opponents' decisions are what really make the game.  Fun, and it sits in that magical lens of the Venn diagram where family gaming and gamer gaming truly overlap!

Played this once on BoardGameArena.com, and loved it. Played it really badly (killed a mountaineer on my first turn), but still.

I had my hopes up for this, but didn't like it & traded it away. It starts off OK but as the game progresses you get bogged down in one spot, and can do sod all for several turns, except hope and pray you either get a card to move up the mountain one space, or try and retreat before the bad weather kills you. To that end the game just grinds to a halt before the finish.

The board is also a bit odd, in some parts you move down, but you are actually moving up.

There's also a weird card mechanic that's very unintuitive.

It grew old very quickly.

It's very dry, and dull, and for the most, multi-player solitaire.

A race game shouldn't stall near the finish!

Another game that is like Ave Caesar in concept , with a climbing theme , but basically a race - and its just about chosing 3 cards from 6 every turn. I just dont like this game.

An excellent, perfectly-themed game that hits lots of right notes for me with length, turn angst, strategy versus tactics... I could go on. This reminds me of Pandemic because of how they both have the perfect balance between thematic immersion and playable abstraction.

Own all the expansions/promotional items.

Attempt to scale the peak of K2, the world's second highest and most deadly mountain. Players use cards, representing movement and acclimatisation, to get two climbers as far up the mountain as possible in 18 turns. The altitude and varying weather will push your climbers to the limit, and even to death if you're not careful!

Theme: Mountain climbing
Mechanic: Hand management
Ideal players: 1-5

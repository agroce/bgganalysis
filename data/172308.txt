As far as gaming experiences go, every time I've played Broom Service has been top of the list. This game is a great time. It's a party in a box. Granted, the game takes a turn or two to get going, and to fully understand. But once it clicks with all players, it becomes a hoot!

A 7 round game where you take on the role of witches flying around the countryside to deliver magic potions. 

Gameplay consists of a card play mechanic similar to Glass Road where each player chooses 4 cards from an identical set of hands to play that round. There are four types of cards/characters: witches who allow for movement, druids who strictly deliver potions (which scores points), gatherers who collect/produce more potions, and fairies who clear away clouds (which open up more route traveling possibilities and the clouds are saved for set collection endgame points).  The real twist to this game is that on your turn you choose to play the card cowardly, which is a weaker action but is guaranteed, or brace which is a much stronger action but is contestable; all players have to "follow suit", and each player chooses cowardly or brace and once a player has chosen brace the next player to also choose brace steaks the previous players action. There is a balancing mechanic in that the last player to successfully play brace must start the next round (it's not good to go first!).

Points can be scored through potion delivery, cloud collection, leftover resources, some events (an event card is played st the start of each round and serves as a game counter as well), and aumulet set collection. Apparently this is a reimagining of a previous game, Witchs Brew, but this game I can only assume is an improvement as the presence of the board/map allows for more planning, and it scales from 2-5 players.  There are some mini in game add ones that any player familiar with board games should use from the get go. Very simple game (as evidenced by its Kennerspiel win) but can be good for some laughs and fun while still allowing for some minor planning and strategy.

3 plays / 4,5 players

LIKE: Very interactive. Fun trying to figure out whether to push your luck or not in a big move. Also fun to block someone.
DISLIKE: Chaotic with more players. Tiny writing on cards can be difficult to read at times, but after a few plays the writing doesn't matter. Players are clustered in the beginning, which leads to similar starting paths.

OVERALL: I'ts a game I bring out to introduce lighter gamers to something light/medium weight. The interaction is very good and it creates a light atmosphere, as long as no one is losing badly. I wish there were more interesting boards available.

I give it an 8 at first pass. The "brave/cowardly" choice provides a little brinksmanship -- and a little "take that" among siblings that provides a sufficiently roller-coaster-y ride.

Rated slightly less than parent [b]Witch's Brew[/b].  Adding complexity to a solid core mechanism rarely improves on a design.  It's still a fun game, but the design is not as tight anymore.  I'm happy for the new "can open with secondary" rule, though.  I probably won't pick it up.

1st play: I had previously purchased and played Witch's Brew, and like it but felt it was a bit random.  This redesign works a lot better because the map helps to give you information about other players' positions, to be able to better speculate on which actions they will call.  The different play modes ensure there are lots of possible configurations, and the base game becomes almost social more than euro.  I have to play it again to determine whether I want to buy it, but I liked this as an improvement over the previous version.

2nd play: I ended up purchasing this game because I felt like the theme was accessible and I could potentially introduce this as a gateway.  I like it better than Witch's Brew because of the board and the various events each round add spice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
A good game that, thru no fault but my own, fell a bit flat for us. I generated a lot of expectation due to the designer and the awards and this is never a smart move, I also magine it is a bit group-dependent as the idea of announcing the action to be performed allows to great interaction and jokes among the players. I liked and will play again, I think it has potential.

When you play and everything is planned out to go according to some plan, everything ends up completely different. It's sometimes quite frustrating. That part actually makes it quite fun for me to see your teammates well thought out plan go to smithereens, as does your own.

Is this better than Witch's Brew? I'm not sure it is. The board is honestly just confusing. the graphic design for the mechanics is terrible. It's also quite scripted in what directions are "good" and "bad."

Honestly, I might like it more if I played with more of the advanced variants. But I haven't gotten to that yet, and I'm not sure if or when I will.

Really great fun. Have only played the Advanced side because I heard the basic was too easy. A lot of strategy and "cut-throatedness" in this one. Plans can easily be messed up which is frustrating, but all in good fun. My wife and I really loved playing with two players. We want to play with more and imagine it will be super crazy but all the more fun with more people blocking your actions. One of our faves!

I always have a blast playing this game. As someone said, it's definitely one where you "play the players, not the game." As much as it can seem too chaotic or random at first, there really are some subtle and interesting tactics in choosing your roles for the round, timing of going brave and manipulating turn order. So much fun to come up with your schemes and plans and then try to pull it off.

The art is, as with all of Dutrait's work, superb. Love it. Components are great. I sleeved the cards.

Witch's Brew was an incredible, innovative design that could be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamer's alike.  Broom Service, its ostensible successor, feels more like a gamers' game, though the theme and art are not particularly mature.  

I liked Broom Service well enough, but I found the art, and the board in particular, unnecessarily annoying.  Whether a scoring tower was in, or not in, a particular territory should have been much clearer.  Driven by the excellent card mechanic of Witch's Brew, there is enough of an interesting "game" here such that I can see raising this rating with further plays.

Three 5-player games on first board, one 4-player game on advanced board.

Card play mechanic is truly original and makes the whole game live up to its "Kennerspiel Des Jahres" expectations. It's extremely hard to guess what other players are going to play next, but it's extremely satisfying when you're able to do so. This is not a pure skill game, there's some deduction and luck involved, which makes it possible for first timers to compete with others who played it a couple more times before.

One downside is, I wouldn't want to play this game with low player counts, the whole interaction mechanic about the cards shine on high player counts. Also, event cards are too few. There should've been at least twice the count to ensure a good amount of variability between each game.

I love this game and I want to explore it further.

Choose Role cards each round that you wish to deliver potions and score points off, and then declare whether you are the 'brave' or 'cowardly' version of that role, which have differing though related effects. There are elements of area control here as you deliver potions to certain towers where they will be permanently controlled or not, and the box comes with a bunch of variant tiles you can play on the back side of the board for much more depth. I do recommend playing that way if you're more accustomed to meatier Euro titles, I think these are the reason why it was up for Kennerspiel award. Anyway, very solid, attractive, entertaining game.

RATING: 7
This is one of those games that I initially ignored; I thought it would be much too simple and wouldn't provide enough concrete information to make informed decisions. But after several plays of this game, I am quite charmed by the whole design. 

Essentially, this is a card game where players are picking-up potions and delivering to towers. At the beginning of the round, each player will select (not randomly draw) 4 cards out of 10. And when a particular card is played, each player with a copy will play it as a brace or cowardly action. The brave action is stronger but may fail. The cowardly action is weaker but happens immediately. Thus, most of the decisions hinge on what cards other players have where you are in turn-order.

One thing to like is that there are few obvious choices. Sometimes, it behooves you to take cowardly actions when last (if you complete a brave action, you go first the next turn). And other times you may do a brave action that benefits you in no immediate way... just so you can go first the next turn and dictate how the cards come out. Either way, it's one of those games that feels like a rabbit hole where you can continuously evaluate, and re-evaluate, all the viable options available to you. And it works as the game provides an adequate amount of useful information to work from.

This isn't chess and players may feel at the mercy of other players' decisions... but for the mechanic weight and length of the game, there is an unusual amount of depth. If I had to complain, I would say the numbers on the board/tokens could have been bigger. Furthermore, this is a game that works best with 5 (but scales moderately well with less players). But overall, there is a lot to like (and a lot of replay value with the 2nd board and variants).

RATING: 9
A fun simple family weight euro based around simultaneous-and-conflicting-role-selection, the same central mechanic of Glass Road. Each player has an identical hand of 15 cards, which each player will select hands for each round. Then each turn, one player will reveal a role and choose either to take safe 'cowardly' move instantly or take a more rewarding 'brave' move. Then each other player in turn order reveals if they have the same role in hand, making the same choice as before. Only the last brave player does the action; they must lead for the next turn of play.

All of this in service of gathering potions and delivering them to different towers in boards, as well as cloud busting on the side. It's pretty simple, maybe even a bit dull, but that's probably the point - the game's role selection makes it much hard to do such simple things. While I like Glass Road more as a game, I think this game implements the same mechanic more effectively, making it a center piece of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The brave vs cowardly aspect of the game is really interesting. It forces you to try to read your opponents intentions, and that's something not all games have (and that I really like).

The art is good, and the core game underneath the cool mechanism is still a fun experience. A bit light for my tastes, but still a solid, good game.

Kennerspiel des Jahres winners are definitely interesting games on the lighter side of the spectrum.
I never played Witch's Brew, but this remake is a very good game.

The mechanics are simple: each player chooses 4 of his 10 role cards, and players play their cards for a "safe" lesser effect, or a "risky" greater effect. If another player has chosen the same role card as one played for the risky effect, he plays it and denies the effect. Simple as that.

The theme is unusual and presented in a nice way. It is an Alea game, so nothing too fancy, but graphics are functional and the artwork is quite beautiful.

There is room for bluff and push your luck, and some creative plays.

A well deserved winner!

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: I enjoy games with a simultaneous action selection mechanism. I find that having to anticipate your opponents' actions adds a level of player interaction which is difficult to emulate with other mechanisms. However, there was something about this game that just rubbed me the wrong way. Perhaps it was the artwork, which I find very similar to Smallworld, which mask the crunchiness of the game. Perhaps it was the limited actions that could be chosen, which would frequently cause conflicts in a 4 player game. Perhaps it was just too late at night for me to concentrate on the game. I'll chalk it up to the last reason and give this game the benefit of another play before solidifying my opinion.

The art was very good considering the theme. At first glance, looked like something aimed for a younger audience. However, there are some very tough decisions to be made in the game. It went a little long for my tastes, for what it is. The decisions of brave or cowardly are interesting and bring up similar decisions found in Glass Road. The board was a little boring to me and maybe the weakest part of the game. It really wasn't for me.

An awesome "hybrid" game that combines classic Euro mechanics (resource management, hand management, pick-up-and-deliver) but has a very high degree of player interaction. Your cards are your actions but can be played either Bravely or Cowardly. Depending on when and how you play your cards you either get a great action, a lesser action, or no action at all and it's entirely dependent on the other players and what you think they have in their hand. It's great. It means every time you play are you assessing people's positions and what you think they are trying to do. The game plays over 7 rounds and really doesn't outstay it's welcome which is nice too. The icing on the cake is the excellent board and card art which is playful and hides the cutthroat nature of the game.

Huh.  It's like playing a programmed action game, but the other players are allowed to scramble or throw away your moves.  I really found it frustrating - too many rounds (out of only seven total) where there was little I could do due to other players actions.  And there seems to be no catch-up mechanism, once you lose your momentum it's pretty much over.  I really wanted to like it, but this was far too chaotic and random.

Witch's Brew with a map. For me, all the extra stuff doesn't make the game better.

Broom Service is quite excellent. The role selection mechanic is good fun and the board always gives you some decent options. There's almost no downtime with the exception of the planning phase, where a player may take longer than others. There's a great mixture of long term vs short term planning and the game plays rather quickly.

The board is colourful and nice to look at, the role cards are decent as well. I really don't like the box art and the game suffers from some euro typical thematic nonsense rules, but with its streamlined design and deep gameplay its overall just very good.

RATING: N/A
In Broom Service, each player has an identical hand of 10 action cards.  Each round, they choose 4 of these to play.  Then, the start player plays one of the cards, choosing either the brave or cowardly version - the brave version is usually the cowardly version plus a bonus action or extra points.  You always want to be brave if you can.  Now players in turn order essentially follow that action if they also picked it, choosing themselves whether to be brave or cowardly.  The catch is that only the last person to play the action Bravely gets to do it - all others who said they were brave get nothing.  Cowards always get to do their piddly little action, and they do it immediately - which means before those who called brave and are waiting around to see if it sticks.  

So there's a healthy dose of trying to outguess the other players.  But there's more - the sequence the actions happen in is dependent on other players too.  And if you're last around the table, you can be brave with no penalty, except that then you have to go first.  So you need to choose actions that aren't dependent on getting something else first - if you can - and anything you think the person to your left might lead, and anything that no one else wants - good luck finding one of those.  There's some luck here, but it's due to player interactions rather than random game elements.  

Broom Service is a fairly unique kind of game, with a lot of getting in other player's heads, and the feel of a trick taker.  The theme is not compelling, but the game is very fun, even when it's frustrating.  I won't ask to play it all the time, but I'm glad it's in my collection.

I was relatively late to the party with Broom Service, the first printing slipped under my notice and I had to wait a long time for this to come back into stock. I’ve really only heard positive things about this game and it’s been one I’ve been pushing to get to the table. I’m not going to review this game. I’m not going to give you a detailed breakdown of our game. I’m just going to say that once we finished we spent a good 5 or 10 minutes discussing the strategies we wanted to try for our next game. I don’t really know how to give a game a more glowing review then that…

RATING: 4
A bad implementation of a good game. The virtue of Witch's Brew was that it was light and short: turns resolved quickly, and there was very little strategy apart from just trying to outguess the other players. Lots of laughs and silliness.

Broom Service takes the basic mechanic of that fun, random game, adds even MORE randomness with event cards, and then applies it to a more strategic board game where players have to plan out a few turns in advance. These two things—highly random, unpredictable gameplay and short-term strategic planing—do not mesh well in this game, at all. 

What in Witch's Brew was usually just a momentary disappointment—being denied an action you were hoping for—can be an extremely frustrating and debilitating setback in Broom Service. There are parts of the board where players can almost get trapped, especially if the event card prevents certain terrain types from being played that round (the event cards, btw, are a horrible addition to this game). The "ha ha you're out" moments become no longer so funny as you miss the opportunity to move on turn after turn. 

This is not a good game. Very surprised to see it get so much love on BGG.

Finally played with some of the "advanced" rules (the tiles). I expected them to be a bit of a throw-in but it actually turned out they were quite cool and made the game significantly more interesting. Now I'm curious to try the reverse side of the board, although it might get a little crazy.

The rating is holding at 9, but as this keeps growing on me it might end up at 10 :)

OK, I do really like this. Very fun, clever little game, reminiscent of the old-school (1995-2002) euros: simple, elegant, light-ish but with depth, a theme that works but only just, and nicely-presented. It hasn't been a huge win with many of my friends because the gamers who liked Witch's Brew tend to prefer the original for its faster pace and quicker action, while players who didn't like Witch's Brew come it at a disadvantage in appreciating Broom Service. But I think if you take this for what it is, there is a lot to like here. A little more control, more to go on in guessing other players' role choices, a little more tactical detail. Just play it at a good clip.
---
I liked this, but it doesn't seem like quite the total win that the original was. There's a little more AP potential, and like Istanbul, with the wrong players it can run too long for what it is (if it runs much over an hour, it'll start being a bit tedious). (As an aside, I almost hate to mention this - any game can be damaged by players who don't play sensibly - but Broom Service isn't quite as robust against over-thinkers as Witch's Brew). But it still has a lot of the cleverness of Witch's Brew, and the tactical boardgame is nice in that it drives a little more differentiation in player positions and so you can make slightly more educated guesses about what your opponents will be doing. The new pack of events (for which there isn't an analog in Witch's Brew) is great. There is still quite a lot to like here, and certainly some players will find that it has a little more control than the original and therefore it will be a little more engaging. I'm not quite sure where I am on it. Initial impression was that's it's a winner but not quite the genius that Witch's Brew was.

Difficult game to develope a strategy because plans can be easily foiled by one brave move. Turn order and the player on your left have a lot to do with success in this one.

A bit too chaotic for me as you pick 4 cards in each of the 7 rounds and try to play them without getting trumped by an opponent. However, the penalty for going brave and not getting anything just felt like too much. This mechanic works so much better in Glass Road where you at least always get something. For a 3-player game it also took 90 minutes which was just entirely too long for the weight of the game. I could play Glass Road, Via Nebula, or Istanbul in that amount of time and have more fun. With that said I wouldn't turn down a game of Broom Service, but it's not one I'd be reaching for off of my own shelf.

Great and fun mechanic with the card choices and the brave/cowardly twist. Second favorite mechanic behind Orleans. Fun family style game with more than enough strategy. A big negative is trouble figuring out in which terrain the castles are actually located. Can be somewhat repetitive. Another negative can be the player count. Need four players to really get the most out of the mechanic.

Very solid programming plus push your luck plus bluffing plus set collection game. This is a gamers game, disguised as a family one. The forced card following mechanism works extremely well, and players' decisions are usually tough. Turn order is delightfully important and can thankfully be influenced.

On the negative side, the board could have been much clearer, and when playing with non rational players or beginners, there is a fair amount of luck involved.

Overall, this is one of the best games of 2015 I've played so far, and I wouldn´t be surprised if it went quite high up the ranks. Alea is back in form.

Just another mediocre pick-up-and-delivery game with a poor excuse of a theme.

So enjoyable. Cute art/theme. Solid gameplay. The card play mechanic of having to bet whether or not you can be "Brave" and judging what cards others likely played and when you want the bonus of being "brave" at the cost of then having to be start-player. Ooooh so satisfying.

Each round the players choose 4 cards from their deck. These are the cards they will play this round. The cards enable you to gather resources which can be delivered to specific places on the map(supposedly as drinks) by means of other cards. One card enables you to remove clouds containing lightning bolts, at least if you have enough magic wands to do so. Players score points by delivering drinks/resources, and at the end of the game by virtue of the number of lightning bolts they have collected, and sets of different resources and magic wands. The crux of the game is that each card can be played in a courageous way or in a chicken way. If a player chooses to be courageous (which can of course lead to a higher return) he or she has to hope that no other player has chosen that same card, and wants to play its courageous action, for if so the card is lost for the player who chose the courageous action first.

RATING: N/A
Score the most victory points by delivering potions via Broom Service throughout the magical realm. Each player has the same 10 action cards to chose from. The game is played over 7 rounds, with 4 turns per round. Each round, players simultaneously select 4 of their 10 role cards, and then they take turns playing one role at a time. Each role has a brave action and a cowardly action; the brave action is stronger, but riskier, as another player could steal the action from you later; the cowardly action is safer, but not as robust. How well can you bluff your opponents?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
- Fun theme, non-gamer friendly. 

- Role selection and timing of play is an interesting puzzle when considering the board and your opponents' positions and trying to predict their intentions.

- Decently replayable with two sided map board and modular rules included that add complexity and variety. Event card mix always changes the flow of each game.

- 7 rounds goes by in just the right amount of time.

- Game scales really well.

Cons:

- Game flow and rules can be surprisingly difficult to explain to newbies since there is a bit of nuance to how it works.

- Not too many exciting moments or turns on the board. The real excitement, or disappointment, comes from the card/role choices and timing of play.

Taught this game to my wife after a tough evening of dealing with a toddler. I messed up the brave vs. cowardly actions and I think that make the game less enjoyable for the first half. With more brain power I could have explained the game better and we might have enjoyed it more. My rating is based on the fact that with 2 the decisions to be brave isn't that stressful with only one other person. I could see it being a bigger decision with more players.

If you are the kind of game player who enjoys coming up with and executing a well thought out plan, do not play is game. Seriously, don't even look at the box. This is a game where your plan will be disrupted by what others do. But if you're willing to accept it, there's a lot of fun to be had, particularly in deciding whether to be "brave" of "cowardly." If you are easily frustrated, I wouldn't play this. But if you can handle that, I would happily recommend this. The more I play it, the more I see its hidden depths and charms. It's a Euro with a lot of player interaction and, as such, it's a bit of a unique creature. We've been adding some of the advanced stuff to the game and enjoying it even more.

This is NOT a light family game.

If you haven't played the B side of the board, you haven't played the game. 

It's deep. It's thematic as hell. When you say, "I am a cowardly..." whatever, it is TRUE. You are a cowardly whatever. Maybe you need to be cowardly, or maybe you just chickened out and you have to kick yourself for it. 

Great game.

Edit: After a dozen plays with everything from jaded, hardcore gamers to newbs, this game is still perfect: no one, not one single player, has disliked it. That is something very, very rare!

The goal csrds mini-expansion from the Broom Service Card Game improve on the one thing that was maybe a problem in the base game: that minor actions can be wasted by the order cards play out. (And to be fair, it's a stretch to call that a problem. The game is designed to encourage smart plays within an uncontrollable environment.) You can now use those cowardly actions effectively if you've planned ahead. Great addition, upgrades the game to a 10 for me!

Quite a good simple but satisfying social euro game. The mechanism is unique and there is a great deal of player interaction.

It is quite meet and simple and simple concept. It won't be leaving my collection anytime soon

RATING: 8
Players move around a magical land, delivering three different types of potions to castles, and enchanting clouds away with magic.  Fascinating game played over seven rounds.  Each round players select four cards from identical decks of 10, and a player leads to a turn (think leading a card in a trick taking game).  Each player who plays out that card has to indicate if that card is cowardly (take the action immediately) or brave (wait for the trick to resolve, but you do the action with a bonus - but you can be trumped by a later brave card and end up with nothing).  Next trick is led by the previous brave player, which leads to a whole new dilemma - do you play early, but cowardly, but get to seize opportunity - or do you prefer to play late and get to be brave ... a real itchy teeth game.

I was very impressed.  Definitely feels an old school Euro, and Alea 17 is currently sitting next to the last Alea to remain in the collection (Puerto Rico) - no mean feat.

RATING: 8
A pick up and deliver game with programming, and card based bluffing. It's a clever and elegant design that I imagine I could teach to anyone who wasn't too self conscious to say 'I am the brave weather fairy'. Though that soon devolved to saying 'Weather fairy brave' after a few rounds. Trying to think what it reminds me of, the card play to me has a twinge of cosmic encounter, the order in which to play your cards reminds me of robo rally (very slightly) and there's a semi route building element - though they are not really routes. Plays better at the higher player counts, but it's actually very good with two, also turns are quick (especially with two) and the game plays really quickly. Seven rounds fly by -it's almost fillerish with two. The card play is a lot of fun, with some take that and room for clever and 'subtle' play. I don't much like the cover but I like the overall aesthetic of the game, with one small issue being the fussy board and its slight lack of clarity regarding where some towers are - though if you illustrate that during explanation - hey presto, no more issue. And in praise of the board: it's quite compact. Set up is instant and the game comes with lots of add ons to spice up game play. Bravo.

Played this again recently I like it more and more.

Witch's Brew version 1.5?  2.0?   The delivery aspect isn't particularly innovative, but the fact that you have two pawns is crucial.  That makes it really tricky to anticipate what other players might be selecting.   You have to be willing to accept that this game will wreck your plans and punish your brave risk-taking at times.   I don't mind that, and I find that the game hits that "comfort level" style of gaming where I can just play casually and have fun with it.

The game has a very straightforward pickup and deliver mechanic but then it throws in this gambling/bluffing aspect (do you choose “Brave” or “Cowardly”) that really prevents you from developing any long term strategy.  Its trying to be a pickup and deliver game yet at that same time be poker and I feel it just doesn’t work.  I lost interest halfway through the game as loosing a gamble really prevents you from planning too far ahead because you basically lose a turn and do NOTHING.  The fact that this won Kennerspiel des Jahres against Orléans and Elysium baffles me.  A game that so random and chaotic as this usually does not fit in the Kennerspiel des Jahres category.  
I keep thinking maybe there is something more to this game that I’m not seeing or feeling and need to play it a few more times to see; but honestly, I don’t really feel like playing this again.

Broom Service is a breath of fresh air.  Chaotic, random, unpredictable and often hilarious to play...I love it.   The intro side has been a success with the family, but best of all is the complex game played with Gamers.  So long as you don't require any degree of control over your game and you are prepared to go with the flow, then Broom Service is a joyous delight.  

It is not too heavy, somewhere north of Ticket To ride, but not hugely so.  It reminds me of Lords of Xidit from last year.  Not in the gameplay but in its chaotic, often hilarious, unpredictable nature.

A worthy winner of the KDJ.

Alright, I think I need to play with strategy next time, because it often felt like I didn't know what I wanted to do. Being brave screws you most of the time...

What a great game, no wonder it has won so many awards. Who would've thought that delivering potions around a map would be so great. But it is. 

The great part of this game is decided what of your 10 action cards you will play, and then to see who had picked similar to you. It can become intense holding out your more rewarding pick of your option to see if you get trumped or not.

Very fun and fairly quick.

The card play is quite fun and gives you more to think about than you initially think. While you have control over role selection you certainly don't have control over the order those roles are played, making for some interesting situations. The rules simple enough for this to be considered a gateway game, but there's more depth there then games like TTR. Haven't played with the extra tiles (amulets, etc.), seems like it could offer enough variability and additional depth to keep gamers interested.

Very light weight game. Very luck driven. A little bit of trying to anticipate what opponents are going to try to do and zig when they zag. Ultimately, it ends up being terribly luck driven and hard to plan out what you are going to be able to do on each turn. 

The brave vs cowardly options are to extreme for how random it is if you get to do one vs the other. We were discussing how many points it would take to compensate for the difference. I think if you got to do the brave action even if getting caught but you lose 5 points as well, it might not be a big enough loss to discourage people from not taking the brave option most of the time.

I thought I would hate this upon description.  Even after one play, I found it to be "OK", but with each subsequent play I've learned something new and gained further appreciation for it.  It is not a thinky strategy game, nor should it be played as such, but the risk management is quite a bit deeper than it seemed to me early on.  Meanwhile, the logistics aspect is fairly simple, but is quite strong in its own right.

An entertaining game with a lot of tension. I love the brave/coward mechanism. You say a lot of "YES!!" and "NOOOO!" in this game. That's a good sign. The round events also create nice dilemmas. Easy, well written rules. I don't think it works well with 5 players. Then, it's too much luck/unluck involved and takes too long time for what it is. Conclusion: A good game for 3-4 players.

There are some interesting risks you can take when choosing your role each round. That tension can also lead to some frustration when the turn order doesn't end up going your way and you find yourself not being able to accomplish much, but that's the challenge and spirit of the game.

Reimplementation of the long OOP witches brew.
Lets hope it is as good as I recall witches brew being :)

This really is not a new version of witches Brew.
This is a much more friendly version, whereby you are zooming around the board delivering potions, collecting ingredients and charming away the clouds.

There is a little player interaction and some resource denial like witches brew, however it still feels very family friendly. For each card you play you decide whether you are cowardly (guaranteed a lesser action) or brave (risking a better action). Citadels is probably a better comparison to Witches brew than this although this does still share a theme.

Overall I am disappointed than this is not what I thought I had purchased, however I am pleasantly surprised that this is light enough and family friendly enough that I could play this with my daughter (10)

I love playing this one but it leaves me with frustration because it is almost impossible to plan forword.

This I play for fun, not to win.

[b]A light, pleasantly-themed, pick-up-and-deliver euro that provides tension in the action selection as players try to steal each other's actions, or force actions for others at bad times. Elfenland meets Poker.

We own this and expect to keep it for years because of Natalie's fondness for the game.

Rating history: 88|10|88...|10|8........|6..
(Natalie: 10)[/b]

April 2017: After [b]16 plays[/b], I feel strongly about two things: I really like this game better when it is just 2p because it is shorter and more tactical/predictable; I am tired of the basic board side because it feels like I run through the same sorts of action patterns every game. The additional bonus tiles of Side B, and the more difficult map look like more fun, and I expect my rating to rise when we switch over.

[b]After 8 plays[/b], the more you play the base map the tougher the choices in this game yet, as you start to learn each person’s play style, and can then outguess them!

January 2016:
One of my gifts for my wife for Christmas (given at our BC family Christmas, December 30th). From descriptions of gameplay, this sounded too simple to be fun. Inversely, after reading the rulebook, I was confused by how it would play exactly. (The rules seemed to be organized in a way my brain couldn't sort.) Once on the table, everything clicked, and off we went.

Our [b]first play[/b] was a feeling-out period as we tried to understand how to play well. Delivering potions is fairly straightforward, but getting wands to charm clouds is a bit trickier, and setting yourself up to benefit from actions chosen at times you don't want them is the real challenge. A small, neat puzzle of finding points with the tension of shifting action availability.

I grew sick of euros after playing hundreds of them, and yet I still love some of the old classics like Elfenland. I think I finally figured out why. A euro with a well-chosen theme, good graphics, simpler ruleset and one solid twist (in the case of Broom Service, the card selection) makes for a great family/casual strategy game. Pick-up-and-deliver is a mechanism I really enjoy, and now I have an excellent light-medium iteration! This game is a winner, even as a 2p.

Beautiful card art by Dutrait.

Nice light play.  It borders on a party game.  Everyone has a hand of games from which you declare whether you are Brave/Cowardly, and then receive/don't receive goods and actions depending on what the other players' cards and declarations are.  Bought it on a player's strong recommendation without playing it first.  I liked the game but probably would not have bought it if I had first played it.

RATING: 7
Broom Service is quite similar to Witch's Brew but it is also quite different from Witch's Brew. The action selection mechanism from Witch's Brew (that was pretty much the entire game in that incarnation) is still the centrepiece of Broom Service. However, the additional spatial layer significantly changes the focus of the game. The psychological component has been toned down and parsing the board state and maneuvering into more favourable positions have replaced it to some extent.

The action selection mechanism is still prominent enough that it's probably safe to say that those who enjoy one game will not detest the other, either, but beyond that bets are off. Myself, I think I slightly prefer Witch's Brew. It's the purer implementation and I'm not sure that the changes add enough to Broom Service to really justify the increase in complexity and playtime. Broom Service is still a very enjoyable game, however, so unless I'm faced with the choice I'm fine with either.

Der blöde auf "international" gekrampfte Titel, das klischierte Schachtelbild mit Bibi Blocksberg und die unbefriedigende Flächengestaltung hatten mich lange Zeit von BROOM SERVICE abgehalten. Selber schuld: denn BROOM SERVICE ist ein grundfreundliches, gutmütiges Spiel von Herzlichkeit, Liebreiz und Organisation. Die grundsätzliche Wahl seine Hexen- und Hexenfreundekarten "feige" oder "mutig" auszuspielen entstammt der Art wie Kinder ihre eigenen Spiele im Hinterhof erfinden. Insofern ist BROOM SERVICE in seinem eigentlichen Wesen mehr Kinder- als Kennerspiel. Das ist seine eigentliche Kunst und Leistung: das ewige Kind im Erwachsenen zu berühren, neben der Kartenidee die einen zucken und zocken lässt, auf die Sicherheit des Verwaltungsbeamten oder das Risiko des Helden zu gehen. Natürlich Risiko. Und natürlich verliere ich und verzocke mich. Dafür gewinne ich einen bunten Hexentrank Herz und Seele. Wenn da nur nicht dieses elende Harry Pottermässige wäre.

Broom Service was a bit of a gamble for me.  I knew that I liked the sound of the card mechanic and that it was popular when originally used in 'Witch's Brew', but otherwise this was one of those games where I couldn't tell if the rest of it would be enjoyable or if this would be too much of filler to find repeat plays.  In the end, it was quite good and very enjoyable!  The card-play is good fun, as expected!  While this is a bit of a programmed movement game (a mechanic I don't normally enjoy) you can either play it safe to meet your objectives or risk going for better options at the risk of losing your entire play.  This creates the bulk of the tension that I like.  All the additional bits that come with the 'advanced' game should be included right off the bad as it really does introduce the variety of decision-making that this game needs.  In the end, Broom Service is nothing terribly deep but it has a great theme, fun push-your-luck card play and room for strategy.  All good stuff!

TL;DR trick-taking + hand management + pick up and deliver + great art and components = win!

I liked this more than I thought I would.  A fun twist on trick-taking and works well with a brutal pick-up and delivery game playing out on the board.

Really incentivizes you to take risks you know you really shouldn't... but what if it worked!?  And it didn't haha

I love how you don't want to go first in the round, and you don't want to go last in the round, and you don't want to go in the middle either... also the way that first play changes based on who wins the trick are cool.

Some people I play with like it for just the trick-taking and could take or leave the pick-up and deliver.

Personally, I enjoy that it's a pickup and deliver that is not set in space, or with trains, or in the Mediterranean.

It's a fantasy theme that my wife actually likes.  The art is wonderful and really adds to the flavor.

I don't think this game has a place on everybody's shelf, but it has a place on mine!

We then played this years Kenner Spiel de Jahres winner Broom Service and it was quite a lot of fun, I can see why it won that coveted award. It has some interesting card play in which turn order is extremely important, you need to plan your moves, 4 moves in advance and make guess what your opponents will do. I like the random events each of the 7 turns which may change your plans. Really liked it.

Contingency planning in board game form! Since you don't control the order in which you will execute your selected roles, you must try to pick roles that will work regardless of order; positioning of your two pawns is critical to keeping fallback actions available to yourself when you are inevitably forced to execute your roles out of (your preferred) order. Complaints about lack of control reflect failure to adequately plan around these risks.

The brave-cowardly mechanism always makes for difficult choices, rewards reading your opponents intentions from their resources and board position, and makes for many funny outcomes.

Most of our plays have been 3p. The bewitched roles work very well to increase competition for the remaining roles, while also giving players an interesting option of sacrificing points to use a bewitched role and perhaps have a better chance of taking the brave action. 

My 7 y.o. enjoys this game, though she isn't very good at it yet. The brave-cowardly mechanism is fun for her and the theme is appealing.

We have yet to play with the included variations.

Underrated game and richly deserving of the Kennerspiel des Jahres.

Very enjoyable combination of mechanisms. There is a bit of a action programming (picking which cards you'll bring for the round), but the order of the actions can be altered by the other players, a little trick taking (forcing the other players to play cards they picked for the round) and push-our luck (the tough brave/cowardly choice).

For all its flaws (mainly: some rules vagueness and a board that's hard to read) this does a rare thing well-- melds a mind-reading doublethink play-the-players mechanic to a nice smooth Euro playstyle.

Some of my friends find the coward and brave thing hard to wrap their heads around it. Some people don't like this game because the game requires you to strategies your moves before hand but with 3-4 other players, things never goes as planned and in the end there's frustrated players stuck with cards they can't use. I personally find the game ok to play, it wont be a game I would suggest to play with people who are new to board games though.

Typical mess of mechanisms that aren't necessarily fun to do on their own and don't add up to anything fun all together.
Pick up and deliver games usually avoid this problem, but in Broom Service the picking up is not connected to the delivering.
It's interesting to pick the turn actions ahead of time and try to stick the other players without useful actions, but the result of everyone doing this is many missed actions for everyone.
Not a terrible game, but with the above plus messy art I'll try to avoid it.

Based on the advanced game with all variants: Broom Service is a deceptive game.  It looks and feels very lighthearted, but requires aggressive and cut-throat play, which is not a negative - just something to be aware of.  It can be frustrating when you can't take an action because of the order your cards have to be played - but players can generally manage this risk.  Nice art work, unusual theme.

Really didn't care for this game. Maybe I'm just bad at it, but the entire game is trying to guess what your opponents are going to do, there is absolutely nothing else to this game. And I hate that. Plus it's so easy for people to accidentally completely ruin your plan since you have to play a card that matches an opponent's if you have it.

Pot luck as to whether you get to do the stronger action on a card (can just take the much weaker option), and cards can be wasted if other players force you to play them out of order. Both of these things can lead to a very frustrating game, the argument of course is that the bad luck evens out, but it is still essentially just 'miss a turn' if make a wrong guess.

Broom Service is well-designed and has some interesting twists on role selection, but the whole affair is way too chaotic to enjoy. It's almost impossible to plan ahead even a single round since players may be forced to play cards in an order that inadvertently denies scoring opportunities. Because of this issue as well as the random movement of starting player making the amount of risk going for the "braver" action inconsistent, this is a game where it is difficult to enjoy planning and making decisions.

There seems to be a lot of guessing what your opponents have. Plus, there  is somehow take-that involved, although I'm not sure how there should be. That all goes to the negative side of the ledger for me. On the plus side, there is resource collection, points, and all that euro-y stuff.

Solid eurogame - a 7/10 for now. The card choosing & playing mechanism is of course central to the game. It's clever, and creates many interesting decision points, but sometimes it's just frustrating.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (October 2015)

I heavily dislike Witch's Brew, but Broom Service is supposed to be a better game. I guess it is, but not by much, I hated the game.

The game components are very nice and the board looks gorgeous on the table (although I’m not sure adding it was really necessary). You can explain it under 15 minutes and the playtime is relatively short, however, for me Broom service is boring and repetitive.

The theme is ok as is the game´s art.

As its predecessor it is very random and chaotic. Some friends argue that this isn’t the case, that you can plan by reading what your opponents need, but I don’t think so. In a five player game odds are someone picked up the same role you did so when you manage to execute the brave power of a card is mostly due to luck AND sitting order. Broom Service has the same issue that Witch's Brew, the last player have an enormous and unfair advantage and he is chosen randomly most of the time. Also you can lose your whole turn with no mistake on your part, for example when someone played a card first and force you to move before you had the opportunity to play a card in a region. I feel you could randomly draw your cards and the outcome will be the same (I saw a friend won this way in Witch's Brew). This is not a bluffing game, if you are near the last player you could be brave with little downside, but if you are among the first players the best play is always to be coward. 

The only advantage it has over Witch's Brew is that you are never obligated to be brave, even if you are the first player.

I’m amazed it won the 2015´s Kennerspiel des Jahres, I heavily disagree, the game is very light.

Bottom line, Broom service is a very light game with the luck factor through the roof. I’m not sure what I was thinking when I bought it as I hated its predecessor. I will never play it again and I will sell my copy ASAP. Glass Road features the same core mechanism but it was properly done.

This is a first impression after one play of the basic game, but I really enjoyed Broom Service. It feels a little bit like a lighter Glass Road, but it also felt more interactive. I'm not sure why, but the role selection each round felt a little more like programming than it does in Glass Road. Several times, I had someone play a role before I was ready and it screwed up my plans. That can happen in Glass Road, too, but it doesn't feel as prevalent. This is a really good game, and I'm looking forward to playing more.

RATING: 6.5
Not as engaging as its progenitor Witch's Brew. The additional spatial element is interesting but not essential, and it lacks some of the toothier roles of WB that add more vicious player interaction (read: enjoyment).

Despite that, Broom Service offers the same sort of bluffing and thought-reading as its bolder parent, but in a much more new-gamer friendly package. The artwork is undoubtedly phenomenal (typical Dutrait, knocking it out of the park), and both the cards and board are brightly coloured and friendly to those new to the hobby. As such, it makes a terrific gateway game - inviting and easy to understand for new players, with game mechanisms separate and interesting from standard mainstream fair; while those same mechanisms are engaging enough for the experienced gamers to also enjoy.

It will likely never be the focus of a game night for seasoned gamers, but it stands as an excellent alternative to introduce new people to the breadth of the hobby whilst not boring yourself with yet another slog through the "traditional" gateways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
At least as good as Witch's Brew, probably a bit better as the growth to a full-blown game has added an additional decision layer. Movement on the board and timing the pickup(brew)-and-delivery part introduce even more chances to mess up or being messed up, delivering a highly enjoyable gaming experience.

Beaucoup de chaos, on ne peut prévoir ce que les autres vont choisir (c'est le principe du jeu) ni dans quel ordre, et on peut facilement gaspiller la moitié de notre tour (ex: je voulais acheter une potion puis livrer à une tour, mais la livraison est sortie avant). Beaucoup d'inconnu avec la carte aussi. Ma première impression est que le concept des rôles est intéressant et que le plateau est de trop. Tiens il existe déjà un jeu comme cela, Malédiction (Witches Brew) - en gros, ma partie ma donné envie de jouer à Malédiction. 6/10.

After playing the Full game this is now the Best family game I have ever played.This is so good with the full game & it really shines.
7 rounds in the game and the first 4 rounds are really fun & then the tension really just keeps building & building to a climax the game is just Brilliant.

Looking forward to getting more plays, as it's light enough to teach easily and play in an hour, but heavy enough to be satisfying.  Some great psychology in picking roles each turn, which I enjoy in games.  The board has really cute art and the game has a cute theme, which makes it look like a kids game.  I'd say it's far from a kids game and might even be hesitant to introduce this to my children.  It might have a runaway leader problem...

The Brave / Coward mechanic is phenomenal! It perfectly rewards risk and balances players scoring a Brave reward by making them select their action 1st (a disadvantage in this game).

Engaging game that features one of my favorite mechanics of card psychology. All players share the same hand and each picks 4 cards during a round and then announces that they play them as cowardly, immediate weak effect, or brave, which nets them a stronger effect that is only guaranteed to one player. If a braver player comes in that witch doesn't get to do anything. I'd like to play this a few more times, but I could see this going up as a 8, and being one of the more family friendly games to come along at that rating for me.

I love this game.  I wish I got to play it more. You need to want to be whimsical and be willing to use the language of being cowardly or brave to really make the most of it. 

Perhaps my favorite aspect is the number of different strategies you can take in order to win. At no point are you pigeon holed. You are always able to climb back into things - if you play your cards right. 

The board and the choices can seem overwhelming, but keeping things simple and taking the most obvious opportunity available seem to pay off in the end.

There are two thing that stand out.

Second the hidden role selection and that you have to follow.
There is is some snowballing at the end. 
In my first game I was behind in turn 4 by 20 points but won by ten a couple of turns later. Turnorder is really important.

The outstanding Kennerspiel duo's game is a relatively complex game with a relatively simple gameplay; it's played on a board (, it needs second guessing and it's rather fun to play. I liked the experience, even though as it is the case with Alea games nowadays (see La Isla), there are some component size problems - practically everything should be 50% bigger, including the board, but especially the small components. And I still prefer Five Tribes over this one (I'm pretty sure it would not have component size problems, had it been published by Days of Wonder ), but it's good, maybe even more fun for some (and I think it's definitely more fun than Isle of Skye above, but that one has the advantage of a great replayability), and it was a worthy Kennerspiel des Jahres winner.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Not sure what to think. I think I prefer Witch's Brew but this one adds in some interesting twists - just wish they had added/maintained the same number of roles instead of dropping down to 10. It really tightens the game considerably and I'm not sure if I'm keen on the fact that 1-2 role cards if played during a round always lose you 3 points if selected in a 4-3 player game. Haven't decided if this will be an acquisition - I will wait until an English version is available. Plays quickly - our learning game took 50 minutes tops even with rules explanation.

This game offers an interesting bluffing mechanism that allows some thoughtful guessing as to your opponents' planning while keeping the system as a whole quite light.

I really like the concept of Broom Service's unique action programming mechanism with the addition of the "brave"/cowardly mechanism. While it does add a large amount of luck, it turns what would otherwise be a relatively interaction-free game into one where you have to really consider what your opponent would want to do. However, I don't think the mechanism was perfectly implemented, in that I like the brave/cowardly aspect, but not the messing up of turn order that can cause you to actually move in the wrong direction. Therefore, if another game ever does this mechanism better, there is a good chance Broom Service will drop to a 5.

This game is fairly simple to learn but I'm not sure if it has a large amount of depth. The far corner of the board seems to be almost strictly better than the other parts, and while the events and clouds are randomized and there are modules I feel like I would use the same general grab resources to create a buffer so I can always do my deliver action out doublethink my opponents, and hope to gradually make it to the far reaches of the board. Without its unique mechanism this would be a fairly drab game despite its bright coloration.

Took everything we loved about Witch's Brew and improved it, at least for our family. Love the mechanics and theme. Solid game that is fun to play.
Update: Decided to let this go. After a few plays the novelty wore off and we all felt we were just going through the motions and it seldom got picked off the shelf. Too bad because I love the theme, artwork and pick up and deliver mechanism, but something here doesn't work for us to keep us coming back. Reduced rating from 7.5 - 6

Lovely pick up and deliver game.  The way you play action cards by declaring "Brave" or "Cowardly" can lead to some interesting decision making and gambles if you are not sure what other players are doing.  I love how this game is easy enough to teach and play while still offering some very fun gameplay.

This game really shines using the advanced side of the map. Don't even bother with the "beginner" side.  Use all of the components like the hill and forest tiles and the storm clouds for an excellent experience.

Cool push your luck selection mechanism. board is a bit busy and there is quite a bit of being messed up if you treat it like a progammable movement game. You need to be flexible but also try to choose things that the others do not. Neat.

What a brilliant game.  What a riot.  The kind of game that has me cursing in good humor, that brings smiles and laughter to the table.  While I do not care much for the graphics/theme (although with repeated plays I am getting used to it and start finding it charming), the game mechanics are truly excellent.  It has a mixture of deduction, press your luck, double guessing, little to no downtime, lots of surprises, and laughter.  It has a spatial element.  It has many different strategies and paths to victory.  It is quick.  It has simple rules.  It is a gem, one of those games that as soon as you are done playing you are ready to play again.  My rating and desire to play has gone up with repeated plays.  I have not tired yet any of the advanced variants, only the "basic" game.

Looks good, decent quality.  Could have fit in a smaller box if they weren't trying to stick with the big box set (I have some of the medium or small and it could have been that size)
Gameplay is quick (this is a big plus for this game)
my SO's big complaint is that its hard to identify the cards and where you need to be on the board.  Its friendly look made room for "close enough" mistakes.  The boaders are kind of blended in some areas.
Nice that you can kind of change the depth level with the two sides and the tiles.  Was kind of expecting the additions to add more depth thought.  So this game stays fairly light.

What a fun game this would be for the 9-13 age group!  How on earth it won the Kennerspiel is beyond my understanding.  To my mind, this is clearly a kid's game, and I could understand it winning the Spiel des Jahres rather than the Kennerspiel. 

Having said that, I did enjoy the game, even with adults.  It's a light, fun, often quite funny game.  It's definitely not a game to take seriously, or one in which to agonize over strategy. In that sense, it's almost verging on a party game.  I feel that it would be a wonderful game to introduce to older children, especially if more effort had gone into production quality.  The art on the cards is excellent, but the board could have been so much better, which knocks my rating down a notch.  Gameplay (caveat - as a party/kid's game) 8.  Components 6.

RATING: 5
The action selection is clever in theory, but I am no fan  of it in reality. Role selection as in Race for the Galaxy is awesome, as it is my decision if I want to play save and chose the role I desperately need or if I want to push my luck, guessing what my opponents do. With Broom Service there is little control on my actions and the mechanism is aimed to ´negate other players actions.
That would still make a good game, but combined with a card like "Old Times" (every witch must be played as brave by the first player), the game is a dead for me. I had to start tat round and two opponents played their last card making me first player again, before the round was done. Out of four cards, theee were negated withlut me having any chance to do anything about it. In contrast, the player to my left could play three cards for maximum effect.
Inguess it is an unlikely situation, but just the real possibility for this to happen makes this a bad game for me.

RATING: 8.5
Prepared to be frustrated at times while playing.  There is quite a bit of player induced chaos, take that elements, and you must be flexible with in game plans.  However, the simple card play based around a pick up and deliver mechanism make this enjoyable to play.  

Even manages to feel a bit like a trick taker.  Since you have to 'follow suit' it also pushes you into some tricky decisions - sometimes you may claim the cowardly action because you really don't want to lead the next hand since you're pretty sure your opponents have the same card in hand you really need to be brave on.  Better to be later in turn order, then.

Update after 9 plays:  This game has really grown on me.  Really still look forward to playing this more.  Plays quickly, but offers interesting decisions.  Need to balance what you need to do against what your opponents need to do so your crucial moves aren't jeopardized.

Update after 15 plays:  Still really enjoying this one.  This game is good for a handful of plays each year so I see it staying on my shelf for the foreseeable future.  Feels fairly unique.

I've decided I dislike this game.  Keep in mind I've only played it with 4.  Perhaps it's better with fewer.  I've played it twice, once using the basic rules, and once with all the extra stuff.  My experience is that this is simply a crap shoot.  Your plans can get stomped on no matter how much thought you put in them.  And if you have a turn or two where you have really bad luck, you're out of the race.  I find this game frustrating. :(

Colorful and fun, Broom Service is a great game to look at and an even better game to play. I like the bits, I like the roles, I like the changes they've implemented to bring a board in, and I like the feel. This is one of the best games I played at BGG FAM 2015. I still like Witch's Brew a little better. My one complaint about this game is the graphic design on the board, particularly the small scoring numbers and differentiation of towers.

Role selection, play it either brave of cowardly. When you choose brave a next player having selected the same role, can cancel your action. Fun but chaotic. Light game and it takes a bit long for what it is. But not bad to pass the time with occasionally.

The simultaneous card selection and the cowardly/brave bluff mechanics are awesome, although the game is a little long when the risk of having your game hosed by a couple of bad bluffs is so high.

It is fun and plays at a good pace. The event cards that tweak the rules slightly each turn maintain interest throughout the game.

It's a pretty and well-produced game, but would benefit from a slightly clearer map.

RATING: 8.25
I liked it a lot... can't say I LOVE it but it's a very very fun game because you can try to plan, and you can even deduce what is likely that the other players want to do but getting inside there minds is tricky... Should I push my luck to get the Brave action and reap the better rewards from that or should I play safe and do the Cowardly action, get a sure benefit and regret it later when no one else after me choose that action?
That's the main question of the game...

I like all the vibrant colors on the board... I LOVE the names they gave to the different characters on the cards, just hilarious!

We played the basic version of the game and, like I said, it's very fun... there were several Laugh out Loud moments... several profanities yelled...

It's a game that you have to enter with the right spirit, knowing it's chaotic but it's super fun in the chaos... you just have to try to plan the best you can and decide when to risk it

An exceptionally well-crafted, smooth-flowing, family-level game.  The board art pops and the card art is wonderful - it draws you in to the fun of flying around collecting potions, delivering potions and dispelling storm clouds.  More than anything else, this shines as a game to play with kids.  

That said, the card-playing mechanism is challenging and  thought-provoking. When you mistakenly declare a brave action that someone else has, it is extremely punishing.  It can disrupt your whole turn!  You have to allow for this and for the fact that sometimes things won't go your way.

Auf den ersten Blick sieht das Material von Broom Service etwas dröge aus. Doch der erste Eindruck täuscht, denn hinter Broom Service versteckt sich ein großartiges Spiel. Die Spieler sind Hexen, die gerne Zaubertränke ausliefern wollen, um dafür Siegpunkte zuerhalten. Die Mechanik des Spiels ist so simpel wie genial, denn zu Beginn des Spiels wählen die Spieler aus ihren 10 verfügbaren Rollenkarten 4 Stück aus, mit denen sie die Runde bestreiten wollen. Doch die Mitspieler können den eigenen Zug ganz schön durcheinander bringen, wenn sie einem die Rolle "wegschnappen" oder man gewzungen wird die eigene Rolle zu früh zu spielen. Broom Service bieten eine ganze Menge Interaktion,aber auch Konfrontation und einfach jede menge Spaß!

RATING: 8
An interesting mix of mechanisms: it's a push-your-luck trick-taking game with a programming element, bolted on to pick-up-and-deliver. Its main fault is a terribly confusing board--it would have helped if the rulebook explicitly included a note explaining that on the basic board many of the towers are in 2 or 3 zones (according to where the base of the tower is situated). Once you get that sorted out, it's great fun, and the exact reverse of low-interaction Euro games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another clever and fun Euro game where the players must travel around a land to gather, and deliver ingredients for potions. They can also charm away storm clouds in order to collect them. 

What makes the game interesting and fun is the central mechanic of selecting 4 from 10 possible cards each round. When a player plays a card from their hand they must declare if they are being Brave or Cowardly. A Cowardly action guarantees a lesser ability but going Brave allows others players to play the same card (should they have it), which means the active player losses their action completely. 

Add to that numerous ways to score (it isn't quite point salad but the options offer various strategic directions) and Event Cards that keep the players on their toes each round and Broom Service is a great little game that will see much play at my table.

Fun game but don't like the duty to follow rule. It is impossible to set up a specific order of play with your own 4 cards. The card play just feels to random because of it.

This is different enough from Witch's Brew that I would consider it its own distinct gaming experience. Over half the game is focused on maneuvering on a 2D board, so you have this spatial, almost abstract element. Potions are made of single ingredients. The only similarity is the role selection trick-taking mechanic. I would describe it as the 2nd in a series, similar to how Antike - Imperial - Navegador share a unique rondel mechanic. Anyway, solid, fun game with a lot of variability to explore in future plays. I would play this over Witch's Brew at this point, but only because the latter's been played out.

I have played 4 times now. I think the game is great. I love the randomness it provides and the quick play. plays well with 3-5 :)  Have not played with 2, but i bet it would play great with that as well.  If there is a game i'd like to start of with it is this one.

The map and the turn by turn events make a big difference in guessing what roles the other players would pick. The abilities of the characters also allow guesses of what one might do in a later turn. So, this definitely makes this game a bit more strategic than its predecessor witch's brew was albeit being still a mostly tactical game. I like the basic mechanism and the implementation.
On first play we played the basic game and despite the choices seeming to be easy, players took some time before selecting their cards, also when playing cards it seemed players had a hard time deciding to be brave or cowardly. This made the game drag, if it happens after several games than it is a concern.

RATING: 7.2
The production value is quite good. Very good wooden and cardboard components, some cards, and the only problem is the placement of some towers in the board that will likely generate some discussions. The rules are a bit vague (or non conclusive) at some points.

It's a game about guessing what your opponents will do and try to maximize your benefits and if possible, doing something different. The appeal of this game is the brave/coward mechanism that generates lots of tension. Appart from that, the game is fairly light: you know what you need to do in order to score points.

The main issue is that in order to guess what your oponents will do, you must be aware of their individual circumstances, and in order to do that, you need time, especially when the player count is high. AP prone players, beware.

Nonetheless, the game is really tense and fun. you are never sure what your opponnets will do and you can always push your luck.

After reading the rules, you can't help but thinking that it is a very random game. But to be sincere, our first game was quite fair. The player who played best won, and the one who did worse (me), was the last one. I'm ranking it considering it's not as random as the rules seem to suggest.

The card play scheme is pretty much the same, except that now you can also lead with the weaker action. The cards are now used for board movement, which is definitely not an improvement. The board is not too easy on the eyes either.

Yeah, this I like. Threads of Clans, Small World and Glass Road all hit a great Euro-centric middle-point, and what's more they virtually coerce sweaty middle-aged men to proclaim that they indeed are 'the brave weather fairy'. A few potential runaway-leader scenarios are all I can find to fault this one: it won't be to all tastes, but the sufficiently-self-aware should lap it up.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Broom Service has become a favorite in our collection and my opinion of the game has only gotten better. My original thoughts still hold true, but I hadn't played with two yet, so I thought I would share my opinions on playing Broom Service with two. 

Surprisingly (at least to me) this game plays great with two. The 2p game becomes a very tactical and you really need to pay attention to what your opponent is doing (as you add more players the game becomes more chaotic). The game also retains the tension caused by having to choose to be brave or cowardly when playing first. I was pleasantly surprised by the 2p experience and will happily play with two anytime. It will take more plays to figure out my favorite player count, but even if you primarily play with two I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.

Quick example: I played against my daughter and ended up winning the game on the first card play of the last round. I gambled on what I thought she was trying to set up and played the Weather Fairy before it was of any use to her. She still managed to score points with her other cards, but losing out on the Weather Fairy really cost her.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- The artwork is beautiful and whimsical which really drew my daughter into the game.
- The production is top notch all around[i] (great wooden potions, great card stock  and the tiles are nice and thick) which isn't always the case with Ravensberger games.[/i] 
- The combination of role selection and pick up and deliver is clever and really engaging [i](I'm not aware of other games that have combined these mechanisms).[/i]
- This is definitely a great [i]"next step"[/i] family game as long as everyone doesn't mind a fair dose of chaos in their games.
- Flexibility is key and you need to make sure you can do a few different things with the roles you select, even if some of those plans are less than ideal. 
- There can be turns where certain roles may be useless if you need other roles to be resolved first.

This game was a hit with my older daughter and surprisingly my wife really enjoyed it (she very rarely gives a new game her seal of approval). My son on the other hand wasn't impressed, which surprised me because he's enjoyed other role selection games (Glass Road being a favorite of his). As I noted above I think it was the fact that if you didn't have a flexible plan (i.e. each card had to be played in a certain order) you could end up with unplayable cards in your hand and have a wasted round.

I'm interested to see how it handles a lower player count, especially 2p, because my daughter really wants to play again. I'll update mt initial thoughts once we play it at other player counts. Turns out the 2p game is quite good, we've had a lot of fun battling it out against each other.[/i]

What a fun first game with the wife! Lots of agonizing over whether to call a brave action or not. Really enjoyed the changing events as well, especially when I spent 6 resources to my sneaky wife'a hand of nothing to bid for 8 victory points. Just a bit concerned about the replayability as the board is static. Needs more plays to see if it reaches a perfect 10

I played a PNP version of Witch's Brew at a friend's and was underwhelmed with the result. The game felt clunky, counterintuitive and sandbox-y; too many choices, not enough direction or objectives. And they must have playtested the shit out of this game because every element has been perfected to make this an engaging, fun experience. And it seems to scale well for every group of players, too (the addition of the "Forbidden" Deck is genius). The best part of the game is the strategy: anticipating player's moves and "stealing" their brave actions from them. A fantastic and enjoyable game; the designers really ironed out the kinks and made the game flow well, easier-to-learn and just better! Brilliant game.

I didn't really enjoy its predecessor Witch's Brew, but I thought that Broom Service would greatly improve the system with the addition of board play. In this game, you move around the board to fulfill a pretty basic pick-up-and-deliver mechanic. The game also varies in that the player going first does not have to declare the stronger version of the action. Both of these are big improvements, to the point where I feel like the game enjoyable (though not remarkable). By contrast, I actively avoid Witch's Brew.

I can't say anything bad about this game, except my main playing partner (my wife) doesn't love it, so I don't get to play it much.  It's dang clever, and got the right amount of open and hidden information that it makes it an absolute blast to play.  Sometimes you need the group to clarify which regions a certain tower touches or not, and the rules are MOSTLY translated well, but everything else besides that is spot on.  The game mechanics, the art, the wooden potion meeples, the witch pawns, the satisfaction of winning, the length of the game (exactly 7 rounds), and the new event that gets drawn each round makes this one of my favorite games of all time.

Initial reactions with a few plays under my belt is that this is a wonderful game, and the cartoonish style hides some very crunchy decision-making. Choose an action and a "brave" or "cowardly" version of the action, essentially a "great" and "decent" version. Then either leisurely take your action or sit and sweat, as if someone else chooses the "brave" version of the same action, you get to do nothing. A bit of take that, yes, but surprised at the depth of strategy and how important planning is, but always have a plan B, as you HAVE to follow an action if someone chooses it. 

Played it 2-player and it's very back and forth, in a good way. Introducing the advanced elements one at a time for each new play through.

I like Wie Verhext! a lot, so I had high expectations of this one, which is always dangerous :-) 
But this boardgame version of Wie verhext! was completely able to forfill them. The board also changes the game so that it has a diffenrent playing expierence then Wie Verhext!, which is off course a good thing, but keeps the fun part of selecting the roles and chosing for brave or cowardly when it's your turn (but I also like the fact that the starting player ain't forced anymore to chose brave). Also a plus about this version is that it's better with less players as there are fewer roles to select from and a certain number of roles give minus points for chosing them in a particular round. 

Conclusion: A job well done!

Clever simultaneous action selection, turn order (timing) and risk management. Medium weight, but fairly easy to teach. Double sided board, extra components allow more advanced variant modes (although maybe too many).
-Pick up and deliver (not our favorite mechanic), some frustration factor when your risks (going brave) don't pay off or blocking occurs. Board, some components have some readability issues. Better with more, 2 player variant rules.

Broom service is an ok game where you select cards for your hand, trying to predict what your opponents will do, so that you can get the maximum benefit of your actions. I liked it well enough, but I honestly prefer Glass Road for a similar experience. Particularly because Glass Road rewards you for getting your predictions right, but Broom service punishes you if you guess wrong.

From Math Trade

Like this game(maybe because of winner bias). The concept is simple, you have different actions(cards) you can do, but every turn you can only choose 4 cards, and for each card there's a brave and coward side, with brave giving more benefits(i.e. points/resources). But if you play brave, if any players behind you played the same card, they can choose brave and then your brave action would be denied, similarly their brave action could be denied too by players behind them, with the exception of the last player who can play brave without worrying about being denied. Played twice, first attempt I won by collecting cloud tokens and the random green hex tokens which gives you a special ability, e.g. get 5 points instead of playing coward, or get to play coward but gain benefits as if you were playing brave. 

My basic strategy is not to stick with the crowd, this increases the chance for me to use cards which don't clash with the other players, which results in me being able to play brave and gain more resources from doing so. Also I try to play safe, coward if i'm not last, and brave if i'm last OR i am pretty sure they won't pick the card which i have.

Second game was close as top 3 players all have 1 point difference. Also, there was this event which makes it compulsory for the first player to play brave, and my friend who was the first player chose all 4 cards which nobody chose and played brave and got through all 4. We were all cheering at the end for him during that round. It was astonishing.

RATING: 5
A frustrating combination of chaos and strategy, with nothing to redeem it. I don't like the brave/cowardly action system at all, as playing it well requires a lot of card-counting and many times there is no way to play it well. The bad feeling from guessing wrong is stronger than the good feeling of guessing right, so the net result is just frustrating. The brave/cowardly decision is made even worse by the chaotic, ever-changing turn order. You can't really plan much, and you can easily get stuck in the worst part of the turn order for a whole round. The unpredictable nature of the turns also makes the decisions you do get to make (like which 4 cards to put in your hand for that round) somewhat meaningless. You can have a plan, but it will definitely not go the way you want it to. It has a lot in common with programming games (Robo Rally, Colt Express, etc.) in that respect.
My main issue with the game is the brave/cowardly decision, but the rest of it is uninspiring at best. I'm not a fan of the generic witch theme, and the ways to get points are pretty standard point-salad euro. The graphic design on the board is somehow both artistically bland and makes it difficult to see gameplay-relevant information like which towers border which areas.

Travel around the board to deposit potion tokens to get VP and clear weather tokens to get lightening (VP at end of game). Game reminded me of Lords of Xidit although game play mechanics are completely different. Here you pick a hand of 4 cards, and then start player chooses to play one (weak or strong) then everyone else must follow if they have that card (weak or strong) but only the last strong gets the more powerful action.

Cute game but other players didn't like it because they thought it was too random.

I could imagine the game playing slightly different at different player counts due to more chance of being stripped of your "bravery". I've only played with 3 but look forward to trying this with more.

A great looking game that builds on the framework of Witch's Brew, But falls a bit flat of creating a new experience outside of its predecessor. I like the travel aspect, and having the board helps visually tie everything together, and I also really enjoy expelling the lightning bolt barriers. I find the events influence the game too much and sidetrack from the main mechanics. Also, I am not a fan of the locations that accept multiple potions being delivered. I would prefer the game make every location blocked after one delivery to encourage constant movement.

O jogo é bom, é bonito, é rápido e tem componentes de qualidade (falta-lhe um starting player token), factores a favor aos quais se juntam uma enorme rejogabilidade, até porque a versão base já inclui quatro variantes combináveis entre si (raro de se ver, o que se torna intrigante), além do tabuleiro de dupla face, bem distinto. Joga-se bem a dois, mas é muito melhor com mais jogadores. Sucede a "Istanbul" como KSJ, mas não é tão bom quanto o antecessor...

A really unique out guess your opponent role selection game which even surprisingly works with two.  As a  duel plays really close.  Nice that the game directions are smooth and streamlined but the decisions are soaked in thought determining how you can get your goals accomplished without conflicting poorly with your opponents.  The theme is so so with its integration as it not quite intuitive how all the mechanics mix with respect to theme but I'm glad it's there and the the beautiful artwork add to the theme despite the lack of integration.  Very good game and I look forward to ramp up the complexity with the variations.

A very interesting and fun game. Not exactly programmed movement, but it does have a little bit of that feel. Simultaneous action selection with the added strategy of playing a card bravely or cowardly. It's Mission Red Planet meets Glass Road for a pickup and deliver end goal. Funny thing about it is that I don't think I am particularly fond of pickup and deliver games or programmed movement, but this was quite enjoyable.

A controversial win of the kennerspiel this year, Broom Service is still a fun little variation on a trick taking game with a pick up and deliver aspect built in. A lot of fun, and even though people aren't happy with its win, it's a good, easy game to get into with a fair amount of strategy and/or bluffing/deduction required to do well. It was decent, but nothing special.

"Great mechanic with the brave and cowardly paths that you can take, and I love the area control as well. Neat little witch meeples and an interesting theme. I can see why this won the Kennerspiel!"

"I didn't play many new games this year, but Broom Service is one of the most enjoyable experiences I had in a while. The game flows really well, there is player interaction without conflict and the duration is just about right."

It took us a while to get used to having your entire turn possibly obliterated by your opponent's choices, but this is a solid, fun game of planning and counter-planning (and saying "I'M the brave weather fairy!")

Never has 'Schadenfreude' been more fun! Far more than "Witch's Brew with a board", it's still nasty but now a race(*) to the best spots. Both strategic(**) and tactical, but be aware that moves can be planned only one step ahead: you have litte control over in which order a two-step-move would get played; an A-B move could turn out to be a B-A, which would get you nowhere.

My seven-year old played this with no problems, including all expansions. And almost beat me in the first game. :-)

(*) I can't spot much pick-up-and-deliver, since I make the resources anywhere, and half the towers are infinite drop-offs.
(**) bolts are an all or nothing affair, as is which area of the board you're going to 'milk'.

I don't like push-your-luck or pick-up and deliver but they totally work in this combination. I can't imagine anyone disliking this game. It's so fun to declare "Nope. I'M the BRAVE weather fairy." Components like the witch meeples are so cute.

A wonderful call back to the sort of German designs that dominated the 90s. It encourages risk-taking and bluffing in a potent combination that I find appealing.

This has been great fun both times that I've played it.  I love the brave-vs.-cowardly mechanic.  The game seems to appeal pretty well to a more casual audience, too, though I'd say it's certainly not quite a gateway game.  I would like to pick this one up sometime.

This game really frustrated me. Everyone I know really loves it and so I was really hoping to. I just found myself angry for a good portion of the game while my plans were constantly foiled, thus stymieing me at every turn. It wasn't very much fun, though I would be open to playing it again and trying not to take it so seriously. For now it gets an "eh."

RATING: 7
My g/f picked this one up. The brave/coward mechanism looks interesting and the artwork is really good.

2plays: It's a solid game, no doubt about it. I actually liked it more than I thought it would. Played the basic game just to get a feel. Will play advanced next time for sure since it's only a few more additions and the game is already super light as it is. Anyways, I really liked the role selection and the tension that comed with being brave or cowardly. I suspect this game shines with 4p though, as there is more bluffing and higher chances that someone will cancel out your play. It works fine with 2 but I felt like it would definitely be better with more. I like events that affect all players in any game, so I enjoyed that too. The artwork is phenomenal and the components are great. I didn't like how a lot of the clouds give you the same amount of lightning, regardless of how many wands they require to charm. Felt like some should yield higher results, since they're harder to acquire. All in all, a solid game that we both enjoyed and I am looking forward to spending more time with it.

The card mechanic here is somewhat interesting, but only because of the player interaction is bolstered by the event cards (and dummy cards in games with less than five players). You can set up a good combination of moves in a turn, but mostly you'll just get lucky (or not), with the choices of the other players. (That's okay because everything about this game is cutesy and light anyway.) Corners of the boards hold the higher point rewards, so that encourages movement. Swishing away clouds for lightning points adds a touch of point acquiring diversity. Throw in the advanced components for something a little more involved and with more direction. It's all fine. Nothing spectacular in this day and age of gaming choice, but the card mechanic is somewhat different from the usual fare. It's all still really just a guess what the other players will do and adapting to that... which doesn't really work because they're thinking the same thing.

Anyway, it comes in at under an hour of quick playing, easy to pick up and teach, it ticks all the boxes of the audience it's trying to please. I don't mind playing it, but I'm a bit over the cutesy themes - even if they are what the public and prize givers are lapping up.

Not sure it works that well with either two or five players. Three or four seems to be the sweet spot.

Pity Alea went with a title in English in a fantasy land. Sigh...

With all the Hexen history in Germany I'd have thought it'd gone well laid over a nice German map using stories from the Brothers Grimm set in fun little witch towns like Wernigerode in the Harz mountains, or a dragon town or two like Furth. Or inject a little of the good ol' Goethe where Faust is taken to the Brocken where the witches meet:

[i]The stick, the broom buoy up and float,
So does the fork, so does the goat;
Who cannot rise aloft tonight
Must be forever lost from sight.

The ointment makes the witches hale,
A patch of rag will do for sail,
Each trough a schooner under weigh
He'll never fly, who won't today.
[b]Faust, Goethe[/b]
[/i]
Or, what an opportunity for Alea to take a dark turn and capitalise on some of the more gruesome witch trials in Trier and Würzburg as the Catholics reconquered parts of Germany in late 16th century the early 17th century. What an opportunity to teach the whole family about our history and our convenient tendency to embrace superstition, abuse religious authority and gain satisfaction from persecuting those outside our beliefs. Instead the game is made all cutesy and settles for just trying to teach a couple of words of English? How mainstream. Where's the burning of Protestants, Jews and witches? Where's the dark past wrapped up in some cheeky introspective fun? Oh, wait, what am I thinking - Alea games should be fun, not dark and brooding. My bad.

Hexen auf dem Besen: Fly cute witches around a fantasy land and deliver stuff. Pity about the English name.

Plays similarly in some ways to Can't Stop for me, in that it makes me want to press my luck way more than is really advisable, and I end up making very little progress because of it. Also shows me how terrible I am at reading board position in some games. 

I also played this incorrectly on the first play, allowing witches to deliver without moving. I'd like to try it again with that rule to see if that changes my mind about a few things. All that said, it's a pretty fascinating game that mixes a lot of mechanics I like, and I can totally see why it won the Kennerspiel.

UPDATE 2018-01-22: Having played it with the proper witch rules, it's a really smooth game with some great tension and inflection points. Really enjoying this one.

I liked this better than I thought I would and I like the event cards and the variable board set up as well.  I also like the card play in which you choose brave or cowardly.  The card play is a little like Glass Road, but if I'm going to play a game like Glass Road, I'd rather just play Glass Road.  In the end, this game is probably a little too light for me, but if you're looking for something a hair heavier than filler that can play in an hour, this is certainly a solid choice.

I really enjoyed it, though my memories of Witches Brew are vague so can't compare it directly. The others at the table thought it was a little too easy to indirectly screw over each others turns, but personally I think this is just part of the pushing your luck vs trying to mitigate it and it works fairly well as a lighter/introductory Euro - hard to say how much my opinion is influenced by my massive lead though. Plenty of variant add-on in the box too which should add more depth.

Played once with 5P. Broom Service pretty much takes the entire framework wholesale from its predecessor [thing=34084][/thing], with a few tweaks thrown in along the way. The spatial element and the presence of clouds on the board prioritises aiming for a desired sequence of actions, an aspect which is far more subdued in Witch's Brew. It also makes guessing opponents' picks a little simpler. In exchange, some wiggle room is added by allowing players to choose the the lesser action from the start.

Not a fan of some elements of the board design (I found it difficult to differentiate the types of towers) and a few modular elements felt unnecessary.

Overall, it's not sufficiently different to warrant keeping both games.

Mixed results. Not much strategy(how did it win the Kenner spiel?) to it. The best part of the game is the push your luck element of whether to be brave or not.

This seems like a very good game.

Been a long time since I played Witch's Brew, but I remember it being pretty good. This seems like a good improvement/refinement of that system, adding a board which makes it easier to visualize the situation without relying on too much on boring analysis because there are psychological elements.

You are rewarded for predicting your opponents.

Wish there were more of the event cards you draw every round, because their twists are a lot of fun. You use 7/10 of them every game.

It can feel a bit chaotic and your best laid plans can all be crushed by other people if you try to push your luck but that's part of the fun. It's a tense and interesting game that plays pretty quickly and is filled with many interesting and tough decisions. You really can't make any real long-term plans in this because anything can happen between plan-making and plan-executing but that just forces you to try always have a plan B (and C). The Brave/Cowardly mechanic is great.

Better than Witch's Brew, as it contains all of the interesting decisions about which roles to select and to play, but has some added elements. First, you don't have to always go out with the brave role. You can choose a cowardly role as you lead off and therefore manage to get a benefit from all your cards. Even more interesting is the board - you now are really trying to figure out how to get around to get to the places you need to go in order to score the points you want.  Additionally, it seems that there are also some added expansion/variants that come along for even additional ways to play the game. Truly a really nice reimplementation and worthy of winning the KdJ.

RATING: 8
This game reminds me a lot of Glass Road and borrows one of the major mechanics from that game which is the follow-the-leader role selection.

Every player has the same 10 role cards and each of the 7 game rounds starts with each player choosing 4 of those to play.  When the start player for that round plays a card each other player must play that card from their hand as well if they selected it for that round, this is the mechanic that is very similar to Glass Road.  This game adds another layer in that each role has a brave and a cowardly action.  The cowardly action gives you less than the brave action but happens immediately.  The brave action gives you more but if any of the other players also played that action they can claim to be  brave and steal it away from you...but their brave actions can also be stolen.  This is an incredibly intriguing mechanic that elevates the game quite a bit.

The rest of the game is pick-up and deliver.  Or rather produce and deliver.  3 of the roles produce the 4 resources in the game (3 potion types and wands), 4 more allow you to move (or move and deliver if you're brave), 2 more allow you to just deliver resources in your current area, and the final role removes weather clouds which allow you to take shortcuts across the board as well as provide end-game points.

The actual produce and delivery component of the game is far less interesting than the role selection which makes me very curious about the strictly card game this was adapted from (which I've never played).  But like I said, those mechanics alone and the strategy involved with getting inside your opponent's head elevate the entire game.

The components also left me wanting.  As is often the case with these Alea "Big" Box games, the board just seemed tiny and this was exacerbated by the fact that we had to decipher where towers on the board that straddled faded border lines between areas were really located.  The pieces themselves were fine but also seemed small and it is disappointing when you have wooden components representing 3 of the 4 game resources (the potions) and tiny cardboard tokens representing the 4th (the wands).

One final thing worth mentioning is I felt the game handled different player count balancing very well.  When playing with fewer than the max 5 players another deck of cards is selected and a number of roles is revealed from it each round (1 for 4, 2 for 3, and 3 for 2).  Those roles, if selected, lose players points.  This is a good balance to the fact that there are less roles selected each round to challenge brave selections.

There are allways a lot of emotions on the table while playing it. That seem's to be a good sign. But after playing it I realize, it's more anger than excitement. 

I'm disappointed about this game. 

I'm thinking, what makes me feel so. Perhaps, cause you are motivated to develop a (small) strategy for the actual round. But at least it depends on the cards of the others and it's only luck, if the strategy sells. The game suggests, it's like poker, but I won't value the game like this: There are too many unforeseeable factors. 

Because of that, I get angry, when my strategy fails and I can't be really glad, when I get an unexpected profit.  For me the glass is half empty - not full.

For people, who like these kind of fortuity, that game is exactly the right one. The game for itself is well balanced and designed. 
(Only the game board feels like having too much candy, but perhaps that should be so for a »familiar« game.)

RATING: 6
Players have identical decks of 10 cards, and each round select 4 to play. One player leads a role, and all others must follow if they can, choosing either cowardly (perform the action) or brave (the action is up to 3x better, but only the final player to choose "brave" gets it). Clearly being last guarantees the brave version, but the bravest also leads the next round.

I think it's strictly better than the original Witch's Brew in that the board -- players are moving pawns around trying to deliver potions to castles -- gives a lot of clues as to which roles are likely to be chosen in order to move, deliver and so on, and there are various legitimate strategies, especially in the advanced game.

With more players it clearly tends towards chaos and I would not play with 5 again. Even with fewer I'd rather play a game with the same doublethink and none of the euro-y set-collection frou-frou, or vice versa. The hybrid approach is so often the worst of both worlds.

In the first game not very accessible to non-gamers, but they will grasp soon what runs this game.

tl;dr: enjoyable family game

Broom service takes that card mechanism from [thing=34084][/thing] and adds kind of an [thing=10][/thing] mechanism to it to travel around on a board. It retains the fun trickiness that card mechanism entails and adds an enjoyable, family friendly sauce to it.
I have to say it could be a tad frustrating at time but it was mostly good fun, so a good use of the mechanism.

I love Witches Brew, but it does have a tenancy to drag on a little too long sometimes. Broom Service absolutely addresses that, limiting the game to a number of rounds, but the board is poorly designed and difficult to use (and entirely non-colour blind friendly) and the extra cards added a small amount more to the game. I'd be happy owning either, but with WB in my collection already, I don't need BS.

RATING: 7.8
board game based on an older card game named "Witch's Brew"

+ interesting mechanic to play cards in different modes (brave/cowardly) with the twist of risking not to get the brave action if another player after you will play the same card in brave mode
+ random events that alter the gameplay every round
+ included game modifications for more variety (second board, extra tiles)
+ materials ok, although the board should be improved
- the theme is a bit too childish, artworks not good
- a bit expensive
- rule book a bit verbose and unclear

side note: The box is unnecessarily big. The board is surprisingly small.

RATING: N/A
A Witch's Brew-ról való emlékeimre alapozva próbáltuk összerakni a játékot a szabály helybeni elolvasása alapján. Eltartott egy jó ideig, de szerencsére türelmesek voltak a többiek és meg tudtuk fejteni.

A kártyákon található sok betű miatt először persze bonyolultnak tűnt. De aztán amikor megértettük a szabályt, kifejezetten egyszerűnek éreztük. Játék közben meg kiderült, hogy összetettebb mint ahogy azt az ember a szabály alapján gondolná.

Magas az interakció az egymást kizáró akciók miatt. Több olyan köröm is volt, ahol túl bátor voltam és semmit sem tudtam csinálni. A legsikeresebb köröm épp az volt, amikor az eseménykártya előírta, hogy minden kártyát bátran kell kijátszani.

Az elején jól elterveztem, hogy átmegyek a tábla túlsó sarkába és ott egyedül learatom a győzelmi pontokat. De az elején mohó voltam és folyton bátran akartam lépni a boszorkányokkal, ezért alig haladtam. Lehet, hogy gyáván messzebbre jutottam volna, de azért érdekes fintora a játéknak, hogy én eltervezem, hogy milyen mezőkre akarok lépni, de tulajdonképpen a hívók döntik el, hogy milyen sorrendben fogom tudni kijátszani a kártyáimat.

Ez a blöffölős double-guessing nem az erősségem, de azért kiderült, hogy nem rossz játék ez. Ha valaki tudja kezelni a kudarcokat, ami itt elkerülhetetlen, és nem zavarja ez a fajta interakció, az élvezni fogja a fifikás játékmenetet. Összességében elég különleges kis játék.

A játék csak nagyon kicsit nyelvfüggő. Pár kör után már mindenki tudja, hogy melyik kártya pontosan mit csinál.

Got to play one game, and really enjoyed it. It's doing a lot of things I typically love (simultaneous action selection, planning and mitigation, etc), and it's doing them well. The rules overhead seems a little bigger than the weight of the game, but I need to play a few more times to really see that.

Looks great, unique and interesting mechanics. Some of my colorblind friends have been tripped up by tower colors. Everyone hits the issue on their first game where you need a witch [i]already in the right terrain[/i] to use Druid to deliver. Haven't played with the advanced materials yet because I keep teaching this to new people.

Broom Service requires quite a bit of thinking -- more, certainly, than one might expect from its colorful appearance. I can't think of a concrete reason a person might dislike this game other than that there is direct player interaction. It can definitely be frustrating if you're playing with someone who plays the mind-reading component better... or so I'm told :P

So far, we have only played 2-player games of this....and my wife likes to push her luck and as the first player will always choose "Brave"...which makes her a little frustrated when I take her action.

The card play in this game is very original and innovative.  There are a lot of decisions to be made, whether it's choosing your cards for the round, brave vs cowardly, where to travel, or which card to lead.  I really liked that aspect.

However, the rest of the game is pretty mediocre.  It's kind of pick up and delivery, but without the pick up.  I also felt like events were often out of my control or random.  Having to play second vs. fifth makes a huge difference, and that is purely determined by which people choose to be brave.  So while I really enjoyed the card play, the game felt a bit too random relative to its length (about an hour).

Not sure I like this any better than Witch's Brew, although the added board play does seem to fit the theme well. For whatever reason, the additional board component very counter-intuitively (since it adds a small layer of time and complexity to the game compared with Witch's Brew) seems to make the game more appealing to many players. Update: Have now played this with several groups that absolutely hated the mechanic, finding the game very frustrating. It's also lost a little luster in my mind, as well. Rating nudged downward.

Broom Service is a repetitive game where one player may find themselves facilitating for everyone by asking the Go Fish question:  "Do you have thus and such a card?  Do YOU have thus and such a card?"  Repeat.  This happens because the cardplay is children's game light and the results are awfully random.  Most of the cards don't feel weighted correctly on brave vs. cowardly.  Bluffing has minimal impact. It's just hard to care.

I don't want to be a connaiseur, no sir! Not with games like this winning the Kennerspiel des Jahres award. Seriously, this game is nothing. At least with the basic game that is and I doubt the variants have a strong enough impact to significantly change the game for the better. It's so horribly, horribly random. There's no reading your opponents moves, because everyone has the same options at the beginning. So all you can do is to hope that you chose cards which weren't chosen by your coplayers. Your turns can easily be wrecked with no mistake on your part. It really doesn't matter wether you shuffle your 10 deck cards and randomly draw four of them or if you select the four cards. The outcome is the same. Events and cursed cards add to the randomness without adding anything that could lead into a game. If you want to have a Poker style game play Poker, there are many more options and possibilities to calculate and it has much more turn angst, tension and flavor when you compare it to a game where you wonder if any of your opponents played that jolly herb collector dwarf from his ten card-pool. I played Witch'S brew years ago, but had a pleasurable game in mind. Admittedly I don't remember any of it, just that I enjoyed it. How did this end in such a devastating all-luck crapfest? All four of us unanonymously agreed to call it quits early into the game.

A couple of unique twists on game mechanics. Really enjoyed this.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun game, but really chaotic. It uses what I call "The Glass Road Mechanic" of cardplay which is a mechanic I like quite a bit. This is also the cause of most of the game's chaos. You might pick the perfect set of cards so that you can play them in a certain order to conquer the board, but if someone else plays a card that's in your hand then you have to play it. So your whole round can be messed up if somebody else plays the wrong card at the wrong time, and it happens quite a bit.

I probably like this a little better than Glass Road, actually. Glass Road tries to be a mostly strategic game, but the chaos of the cards can be really disruptive. Broom Service presents itself as a lighter, goofier, more chaotic experience from the beginning.

Aside from that chaos, there is still quite a bit of strategy to consider if playing the "advanced" game. You get bonuses for entering different areas, so there's a risk/reward of going out of your way to get a bonus, or just moving into the higher point-generating areas.

For the player count, it seems like this will be best with four. You still get a good amount of chaos and competition with four players (as compared to five), but the game moves quicker and the "dummy" player is very minimal (with fewer than five players you add cards from the unused player deck to help simulate competition).

Overall, a fun game.

I like this more than Witch's Brew, its predecessor, because I like the idea of moving around the map with a destination and plan in mind.

Best at lower player counts. Add a player, add some chaos. Even though it's touted as a great two-player game, I prefer at least 3 players to enjoy it. But 5 is too much. Never again.

RATING: 8
Hello, dear reader and good morning/afternoon/evening! (To be fair I don’t know when you will be reading this, I have to cover my bases wouldn’t you agree?) If you’re anything like me you love a good mythical theme involving magic. If you add one that’s whimsical and fun on top of that with mechanics that are crunchy and tense and fun to boot? Color me intrigued. Today I am going to write about a game that to me encapsulates all of the qualities I’ve mentioned above. The game I’m referring to is Broom Service by Alexander Pfister and Andreas Pelikan. 

In Broom Service, the players take on the roles of witches, druids, gatherers, and fairies to try and deliver different colored potions to towers around the map. Players can also charm clouds away and collect tokens for doing that which will give them more and more points at game’s end based on how many they have. You will also have points at the end of the game based on the resources you have in your supply.

At the onset you may say the game sounds a bit simplistic, you’re trying to move on the board and deliver for points. The thing about Broom Service is that there is a fascinating card play mechanic that utilizes a trick taking style interaction. Each player has 10 cards that are identical, and each person must pick four cards to play each round. When the starting player for the round plays a card, each other player in clockwise order must play that card if they have it. The trick is (see what I did there?) that each card has two options: a brave and cowardly action.

The cowardly action is safe. When you play the card you instantly get to take that action. Then the next person who may have the card plays it and chooses cowardly or brave until all players have chosen. Brave actions are much better than cowardly but there is a risk associated with choosing the brave action. If you say for instance, “I’m the brave hill Witch!”, the person to your left may say “no I’M the brave hill Witch” and play that card. When someone chooses the brave action after you, it cancels out your action and you don’t get to do anything. 

This very interesting trick taking card mechanic can create soaring highs or plunging lows for players. If you are for instance one of the lucky few that leads a card and brazenly declares that you are the brave role, and then make it through the gauntlet of other players vying for your points, a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction can occur. You may end up on the flip side of that coin, however. You’ve played the brave action and made it all the way through the round to the very last play. You then notice the devious grin on that player’s face and the wickedness in their heart as they slam down the role card that you selected and shout “BRAVE!” as loudly as they possibly can. This crushes your hopes almost completely as your plan is now dashed. 

This can be a very tough round to go through but one thing I’ve learned the more I play the game is that timing is quite crucial in Broom Service. You have to make sure that you select cards that don’t require a certain chain of events to take place. You will almost assuredly not be able to complete your objective if that is the case. I played quite a few rounds trying to pull off a big combo and optimize my possible points before I learned the lesson; you have to have a safe plan, and a backup plan, and then optimize your points within those plans. You will almost never have things go completely your way, and that’s part of the fun of Broom Service. As an example, you may select the Weather Fairy card thinking “I just need to move here to be adjacent to a cloud” or “I'll play that card to get more wands and then I’ll be fine”. What always seemed to happen to me is that turn one of the round, someone would play the Weather Fairy making the rest of my actions useless. Once again, this type of strategy required too much going my way, you have to avoid that if at all possible and you will do much better.

One of the things that I really enjoy mechanically about the game is the ability to move two pawns instead of one. This accomplishes a couple of things. One, it allows you to spread out more easily to reach more of the board. Two, it allows you to go a different direction if someone is tagging along and making things difficult for one of your pawns. I had an instance in a game recently where a player was moving everywhere I needed to move, or delivering to towers before I had the chance leaving me blocked. I was able to switch my strategy mid game and focus on the other side of the board which allowed me more freedom towards the end of the game. I like this quite a bit because it allows to be flexible and react to how other players will play.

That’s one of the areas where this game really shines. It’s a game that has a Euro feel with the victory points and resource collection but has so much player interaction. This game gave me a feeling similar to Camel Up where everyone around the table was engaged and yelling when certain cards or actions were revealed, or when someone really bluffed well and didn’t have the card at all. The interaction is quite a bit of fun.

There’s a lot of fun packed in this box. There’s also quite a bit of variability packed in the box as well. The game comes with ten event cards, seven of which will be used each game. These event cards provide a different strategy to pursue or limitation to overcome each round. There are also cloud tokens that can be collected for end game points, but some of the cloud tokens also have special requirements that allow for different actions and ways to score points. There are two sides to the board that allow for more variability with travel and there are also different tiles that relate to the land types around the board as well. You can play with multiple variations on both sides of the board to create tons of unique combinations and strategies. Overall for a $45 game, this is quite a bit of content for what you’re paying. 

So you have a good feel for the mechanics and some of the interactions but what does this game do really well and what does it do poorly? As my friend, Nacho Libre would say, “let’s get down to the nitty gritty”. One thing that I’m not a huge fan of in the game are the Bewitched cards. This is something that the game incorporates in games with less than five players to steer players towards picking the same cards. What happens is a certain number of unused player cards are turned over each round (based on the number of players) and these cards are penalized for the round. If players choose to play any of the Bewitched cards they lose three points per card. This creates more player interaction which the game definitely does better with. I just don’t always like losing points when playing something that I really need. I will say however that I completely understand why the bewitched cards were needed, they just aren’t my favorite part of the game.

When I really think about the bewitched cards and lower player counts I started to realize that this game really shines at four or five players. It’s fun at two or three it just becomes much more tactical and thinky. At four or five players the strategy is still there but there’s also just so much fun interaction between players.

Broom Service isn’t too complicated to play with younger teenagers which makes it a great choice for a family game that everyone will enjoy. If you want to utilize some or all of the variations on top of that it will create a much more interesting experience with more decisions with every turn. Overall if I had to give this game a numerical rating I would probably round up to an 8 out of 10 based on BGG’s rating criteria. This rating is listed as “very good - enjoy playing and would suggest it”. That statement couldn’t be more true for me. I very much enjoy playing this one and I think you will too. I’ve bought this game for two members of my family and will keep recommending it to people looking for a great family game. 

I hope you’ve found the article informative and helpful. If you have any questions email thediceyreview@gmail.com. If you want to know how to play the game I’ve uploaded a how to play and thoughts video on the Broom Service BGG listing. Thanks so much and until next time, I’ll see you at the table.

I'm shocked that I liked this game as much as I did and do.  I knew of it but only picked it up because it was sub $20 and knowing that it has a bit of Glass Road in it (which I love).

But this game is a super smooth piece of design.  It works great, plays fast, has a super simple rules set and is easy to learn.

It's just a lot of fun to play gets done in an hour if you know the rules and provides laughs and good strategic play.

If that's not enough the board is two sides and there are several modules that feel like a free expansion, you can't beat the value.

One could call the graphic design of the board and layout of the towers a mess, so you need to explain those geography inconsistencies before hand, but that is my only knock.

Broom Service re-implements Witch's Brew by adding a board where you need to deliver potions and chase away clouds. The cards are changed. You now gather potions instead of resources and there are cards that let you move on the board, deliver potions to castles, and chase away clouds.

I was a little doubtful whether this game would add anything worthwhile to Witch's Brew, a game I think is already great. It certainly worked better than I feared. It's not a bad game at all, but where it shines is in the core mechanic of the card selection, which is identical to Witch's Brew. The board does change things slightly as there is now more information to infer whether someone might want to do a particular action. But I still don't know that it improves the game so much as takes it in a different direction. I think it might make it slightly more "game-y". That might appeal to gamers, but also slightly detracts from the purity of the game mechanic.

Overall, I'm still not sure how I feel about this versus Witch's Brew. I'd want to play both again to compare/contrast. But even if I decide Witch's Brew is the better game, this is still employs the core guts of Witch's Brew and delivers a very similar experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I didn't think this was a bad game but it's really not my style. Both the skill and randomness of the game largely come from predicting whether other players want to take the same action as you. You get the most powerful moves by guessing "no" and being correct. If you guess "no" and are wrong, your entire turn is wasted.

I'm not a big fan of the actual actions that you're taking. They are both not very interesting (moving around and doing stuff on a map in a not very interactive manner) and not very simple (making it harder to calculate and keep track of what's going on).

Also in this category, I don't like that you get increasing bonus VPs for sets of resources at game end, but you also redeem resources for VP during the game. That's a primary thing you're trying to do. One or the other please!

Thought I would like this game at least as much as the game it is derived from (Wie Verhext). Unfortunately, I did not. Outguessing your opponents can be fun in a short, focused game (like Wie Verhext). It is mostly frustrating in a long game in which additional moving parts (racing, set collection) all depend on the success of your guesses. I really do not have any desire to play this game again, and my fellow players mostly felt the same.

Amazingly, Pelikan and Pfister were able to both change AND streamline the original formula in Witches' Brew. Hard limiting the game to 7 turns manages to work wonderfully and the board play is gentle enough to not get in the way of the role selection, which is always where this game is at.

The original still retains it's goofy charm and will always have a spot on my shelf, but Broom Service will be what I reach for when October rolls around from now on.

the first two times I played BR, I gave it 6.5/10. But from the third time, I can't help making it one of my favorites. Of course, it is not a game that makes you spend 2 3 hours to trying all the strategies to beat your friends. It is shorter and much much funier, but still keep you thinking.

I've been introducing BR to both newbies and serious gamers, not everybody loves this game but what is sure is they have good time playing it. I am surprised by the fact that the game is easily understood by newbies (although its brand of kinnerpiel). After less than 10 minutes if explanation and 2 test round, they can play smoothly. For serious gamers, we make them play the advanced side with all the mountain, forest and hill tiles. And they said BR becomes really deeper, giving a lot more options for player. And it is fun.

Don't let the box and cutesy art fool you, this game has some serious teeth to it.  It's quite procedural and sometimes nasty, as the brave/cowardly system is ruthless if you guess wrong.  There's more than a little chaos here, but it can be mitigated by not risking.  The witch theme is pretty thin once you get past the art, but the interlocking mechanisms of the game make it very tight.  There's timing, and movement, and a desire to do everything, but the best player will be keeping an eye on the other players and trying to do what they aren't.

I had earlier played the prototype, and was curious to see the final version. Re-implements the role selection of Witch's Brew. Somewhat typical to modern games there are several add on modules already in the base game box.

In a vacuum, I think Broom Service is a great reimagining of Witch's Brew. There are some great press your luck moments, as well as plenty of opportunities to bluff your intentions and throw off your opponents. The theme is silly, maybe even nonsensical, but it works nicely as a colorful, charming and non-threatening family game.

Which is to say, I think it is a solid game. However, it's not in a vacuum. It lives in a world where Uwe Rosenberg already borrowed the primary Witch's Brew mechanic and made the brilliant Glass Road. Glass Road has more roles, making the planning phase more interesting and more "activities" to pursue than just moving a pawn and collecting a token. That may not be fair to compare the two games since Glass Road is a mid-weight Euro and Broom Service is a deliberately simpler family game...but I can't help but feel like I'd rather be playing Glass Road whenever I am in the middle of a game of Broom Sevice.

RATING: 5.5
No point in being "brave" unless you're the last player as player actions are too easy to forecast. This leads to a majority of conservative play which nullifies the one feature allegedly interesting about the game and renders it unexciting and without tension.

Even taking into account the mild intrigue of bluff/double-bluff, the remainder of the game is fairly uninteresting mechanically and needs a much more interesting dynamic to hold attention in the face of failing or even at times succeeding the first card-play phase.

A good entry level Euro no doubt as it has its roots in Witch's Brew, but still undeserving of the 2015 SdJ award for what is essentially a rehash with a few tweaks and variants.

A sweet family game ... I think not. It looks good, the card art is great and the game play is really good fun and there is a lot to think about. There is role selection, double guessing opponents, route plotting, delivering sweet bottles of potion and you get to be nasty! Are you brave enough to play it, or are you a coward?

RATING: 6
It's sort of fun, but the we all thought that the frustration levels associated with the game outweighed the fun.  I think the mechanic was actually better suited for the original short card game, as the board play just adds complexity to the mechanic without adding much fun.

I like the "brave" and "cowardly" decision in the game. It's very tough to call when playing 4-5 players

We were 5 non-german-speaking playing the german version so we started with some difficulties but then everything became clear and we all appreciated the game.The best part is of course the play bold/ play coward thing but i also liked he fact you can score points in different ways and that you need to spend time travelling to reach more lucrative parts of the board. Different turns play ou differently and this makes the game more interesting. I'd say a good choice for KSdJ

04/05/'17: Have played a 2p and a 3p so far. Really enjoy this, I like the race to get to the valuable spots, the brave/cowardly mechanic which works well and makes for funny moments, and the way you have to try make the best of the sequence cards are played. So far I've just used the basic version, and will do so for a few more games before trying the extras.

I can see why it's received good reviews. That said, I think I'd rather play Witches Brew as the board didn't add -that- much.

Pretty game. Works somewhat like Glass Roads in that if someone else chooses the action that you also chose, you have to play it. A little frustrating at times.

I took a risk buying this one, and I'm glad I did. My family really enjoys it, and my non-gaming daughter is almost always willing to join in for a game of Broom Service. The artwork is pretty blah, but it doesn't detract from the fun a group can have playing through it. 

Will you be Brave, or Cowardly? (Hint: You'll probably be cowardly.)

To me, not an improvement over Witch's Brew. Art is lovely, but the original was a lot cleaner, and thus more about guessing the cards other players picked.

Very, very fun game with a fun theme. Very good tactical game with interesting choices that lead to exciting and fun gameplay. Lots of replayability with different variations in the box and scales well. Definitely one of the best.

I enjoy Witch's Brew however it needs 3-5 or 6 players with the expansions so it rarely hits the table. Recently my bro, Jerry came back from Essen with a luggage of games to add on to his collection. Among those are PitchCar Mini and Broom Service. We tried both games when we went over to his house and love them. It's really awesome that Broom Service can be played with min 2 - 5 players. We love games which can be played with a least 2 and more players when have more people on games nights.

2-5 players use their deck of action cards to make a deliver potions to various locations on a central board. Each action can be used bravely (more powerful) or cowardly (less), but if somebody else uses the brave action from the same card after you, your move is eliminated.

Re-implementation of Witch's Brew. The addition of the board feels redundant, adding a layer of unnecessary consideration to what was an elegant game. In particular, the positioning of the castles can make it difficult for players to make out at times.

Como nota positiva trae muchas variantes que le dan gracia y rejugabilidad.

Simultaneous action selection and action following like Witch's Brew or Glass Road.  Quite an enjoyable game as you try to position your pieces for success based on the flexible nature of how you're take your actions.  Guessing when to be brave and when to be cowardly is a lot of the fun.  A very nice, unusual middleweight resource conversion Euro.

Love the game. The game tends to be fairly chaotic and becomes an exercise on trying to read your opponents. It tends to ruin your strategy and then becomes quite tactical: trying to do your best with what you got.
The brave/cowardly mechanic is great (a legacy form Witch's Brew) is simply great. That's the core of the game and is also something that can break you if your game if you are not flexible enough.
With only 7 rounds, every choice you make becomes important and significant. Definitely not a game for people prone to Analysis Paralysis; but a great game altogether,
The art is gorgeous and the Kiki Delivery's Service inspiration on the theme is unique, yet relateble and fun.

Great game!

I really like the central mechanic of deciding whether to be cowardly or brave but since I play mainly 2P, and the plays better with more, I'm happy to play it anytime but don't need to own it.

You're constantly screwing up your opponents' carefully laid plans, or having your own torn to shreds. Has many layers of optional rules (like mini-expansions) and a double sided board. Easy to teach and play.

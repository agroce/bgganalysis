A nice fun game of keeping movement secret.  I feel this game is a bit heavily in favor for the girls, and against the matrons, however, and no one really wants to play as the matrons blindly wandering the hallways, trying to hear noises and such.

The LOS thing is annoying and new players can easily "cheat" accidentally. A game like this needs to either be simple enough as to prevent the hidden role from cheating, or have the hidden role be played only by the experienced players. Having all players but ONE being hidden, prevents the latter.

This is a nice introductory game, whenever we have people who are new to more serious board games, our group usually brings this out and plays it to show people “look, board games aren't that scary!” While I have never won a game (I've come so close!) I still love planning out my routes and predicting what the other players will do. Sometimes it helps to be slow and cautious – but predicting when to be slow and when to be fast can be tricky. Not to mention, the other novices might mess up your strategy without knowing it!

A great idea and with the right crowd will work great but I wonder how balanced the different routes are as it always seems someone is miles ahead and they also have one of the rooms one the end that are easiest to get to. Could probably use a third nun character to add to the tension.

Surprisingly fun. I think after many playthroughs it won't be as fun, but until then, I think it's fun. It's a bit clunky sometimes with the line of sight rules, but the table at the back helps. Surprisingly, gives you some tension as you run away from the guards and thematically works well.

one of my childrens favorite games....and my mother in law too (lol). really feels like you are playing hide and go seek. not hard to learn but is easy for people to "cheat" and not get caught.  most of the time the "cheaters" do not know they are cheating because it is tricky to visualize the moving characters when they are not actually on the board. See Tom Vasel's review from the DICE TOWER to get a great picture of this fun game.

+ It's basically hide-and-seek in a board game; With a good nuns player, the tension and theme really come alive.
- Some players bog the game down by taking too long to record their moves.

I think the best part of this game is being the nuns on the run. 
Being the guards can be abit boring, you have some input into how they move around but you don't feel as much tension as you do when you are the nuns. 

It is fun watching people's faces and the post game analysis is always fun

Reverse Scotland Yard with a Kill Doctor Lucky art feel. Played with 4 players - the Prioress and Abbess player complained that there was not enough sounds or sightings, which meant that they were always on their "track", so it felt like he had no control over them. Probably better with more nuns to chase.

Nice deduction game with a cool theme. Players take the role of young nuns that go out of their rooms at night for their own reasons. One of the players take the role of the abbess that patrol the monastery trying to catch the nuns. Nuns are writing on a paper their position instead of actual moving on the board. The game takes around 1 hour and it supports up to 8 players.

Light, fun game.  The hidden movement mechanic adds a fun element to the play, and there is plenty of tension as the nuns try to hunt down the hidden novices, sneaking around the nunnery at night.  

Some of the line-of-sight rules are "testy" and many elements on the board is not as clear as they could have been, leading to confusion.  The rules are also quite complex, as a means to address all the questions that arise from the hidden movements.

Overall a fun game.  Once you get the mechanics down, it does flow quite quickly and is very enjoyable.

Tested this at GenCon 2010 -- play is very similar to Scotland Yard.  Seems that playbalance is a little bit off -- the two "guards" in a full game had a horrible disadvantage.  Not bad, but nothing to go nuts over.

Line of sight rules are too fiddly for my tastes. It's quite good that when you are caught you are still in the game; but when I played we had several "discussions" as how to interpret the "head back towards your cell" rule. It would have been better if the rules simply said "miss a turn" or even have the guard player play your next move for you.

I really think this is the best 'hide and seek / hidden movement' game around (ala Scotland Yard / Fury of Dracula). It brings more balance and more 'game' than Scotland Yard but doesn't provide lame events and a hokie combat system like Fury. Only gripe is that determining whether you can see or be seen sometimes is difficulty to determine on the fly... and if you spend alot of time determining that as an initiate, it can give away your proximity to the nuns.

Game is really fun, and I can see it being great to play a few times but the one game I played (as the headmistress or whatever) I won randomly at the end of the game with a lucky guess as to where a person was.... and caught a different person.  It left a few people with a bad taste in their mouth.

Sort of Scotland Yard in reverse. The specifics of when the novitiates can be heard seems to be unclear in the rules, going by those that had read them in my group.
Thinking that you've worked out how to avoid the Abbess/Prioress and having someone else lead them to you ends up being annoying at times.
The charts of sightlines would be more helpful if there was more than just those on the rule book though.

A "reverse Fury of Dracula" of sorts, this one is a nice excercise in deduction (for the antagonist role), or of double thinking (for the novices).

The concept is neat, the theme is funny and fresh, and the execution is actually fun. However, there are two main concerns from me regarding this game: 1) it lasts too long for such a light game, and it has a lot of downtime, and 2) an experienced antagonists just knows how to be able to "camp" around the novices cells, making it impossible to get through.

I'm still trying to figure out how to mitigate the 2 things I dislike about this game. Perhaps a few tweaks can push it's rating up.

Stumbled through my first play.  Has potential but seemed a bit klunky.  Raiting on hold till I get another play in.

update:
Moyerson is an interesting designer.  His games have fun ideas and are frequently enjoyable despite their rough edges.

Nuns is just like that.  A fun game of hide-and-seek with some potential end game problems that don't necessarily tank the whole experience. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The rules have some flaws, for example if the nuns roll for noises on the first round (because the guards didn't more yet) (and also when a nun is caught the game is over for them, because it will be very dificult to out run a nun that didn't get caught).

The game ideia is very simple and yet fun. Players (the nuns) secretly move on the board recording their movement on paper, the other player (or players if playing with all 8 players) try to catch the nuns before they manage to fulfill their mission objective.

I'm beginning to find that it's almost impossible for the guards to win... :/
Really you have to apply the following rules: Nuns cannot move twice on the first round, and the Guards move first and then the nuns, instead of the regular rules, where the nuns move first and guards later.

I can't believe this will scale well. too few and guards have nothing to do, to much and they can do what they please each turn.
at least with more players once you're caught it's basically game over - either someone will now end quicker, or, if everyone has problems, the guards will win.

Great thematic family game. Mostly a lot of players are trying to catch one oponent in these sort of games. But this game is the other way around. One player tries to catch all the others. The noise and spot mechanics are very natural and therefore easy to grasp. There are some tough areas on the board where it's not always aparant what can and can't be seen. But overal the gameflow is quick and fluent. There could be some issues with replayability as there are relatively few secret wish cards. I'm also not quite sure if the double move the Novices make at the start isn't too strong. Maybe forbid them to run on the first turn? But overall a great and very funny game!

As a veteran wargamer this is hard to rate, definitely light and not challenging, but rating it on a wargaming scale is ridiculous. 

As a light weight family game, it promptly enticed my teenage daughter and her friends to play, so it was a social hit with a group that essentially does not play board games.  Which counts as a major victory in my book! 

This one will hit the table again. Rating based on the target audience it is meant for.

Hide and seek on a board! Very tense, and extremely hilarious theme! Everyone is involved all the time. Writing your movements on the pads feels a little like writing thoughts during Clue, which is great because everyone can relate to that! I absolutely love this game! 2-8 players is a huge plus, too!

I play with particular house rules that keep a certain level of intensity throughout the game. Unfortunately, the one thing that holds this game back is having to explain it to new players each time. It's often their first foray into secret movement, too.

RATING: 6
Scotland Yard is a game that I've loved since childhood. I remember playing it with my brother when we were kids, and so the idea of flipping the paradigm and having multiple Mister Xs with only one detective was a must-try. As a concept this game works brilliantly. Watching the Abbess and Prioress march along their paths while hoping you can go undetected is heart-pounding. Rikki actually described the game as "stressful" when you're one of the novices trying to avoid capture. So it perfectly captures the theme of sneaking around trying to avoid detection. The problem is the fiddliness of the execution. There are so many questions that can come up. If they only made it more clear where you can be seen and where you cannot it would flow much more smoothly. Instead the game can freeze as players try to clarify those rules. Plus it is so hard to ask any questions without giving away your location, so it can add one more level of frustration to the situation, and to make matters worse this can happen with every step the Abbess and Prioress take.  So, while it's a game that I don't mind playing, and my wife seems to be completely hooked on, it's not one I often suggest simply because it is so difficult to execute.

RATING: 7
Based on one play with 5 players: took a while to learn the rules, but once we got into the swing of things, the game moved quickly and was fun.

Would be good if the game came with a die for each player though, so you didn't have to pass the die around.

I do worry about how fun it is for the guards - but it gets better with 6-7 people?  Might have to buy it!

Fun, even for the guards, with 6+ people.  Its a good casual game.

Poorly done rulebook, though.

Guards reveal their cards after they move, so they can run if they see a novice while walking.

Guards can move off their path when seeing or hearing a novice, they do NOT get free movement.

Finally, a novice can choose to stay caught (and moving towards their cell) for multiple turns if they wish.

good game but it requires someone to really know what they are doing and for them to preferably play as the abbess and prioress.  The hardest part is determining the line of sight of the nuns, after that the rest of the game is easy.

RATING: 5
Could have been quite good but clearly not playtested enough and severely let down by the quality of the rulebook which manages to be repetitive and ambiguous at the same time - quite an achievement. When a game that has been out for such a short time requires such an extensive FAQ it is never a good sign.

I probably did not think as little of the game as my fellow players but I did think that this has been done so much better (Fluch der Mumie?)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even though it reminds and likely takes inspiration from similar and better known deduction games, Nuns on the Run is as much a fresh and addictive game as a source of steady chitchat and mocking among the players: the struggle for what to do next that tears the more thoughtful players when they get a clue and their uncertainities about almost every move are a wicked pleasure only the rasher and more impulsive players (who are at their ease here) can enjoy.

Light on rules but heavily depending on them, Nuns requires each player to be at least familiar with gaming mechanics in order to play it correctly, since there’s no real control on what they’re doing until the end, when movements are retraced step by step: nonetheless, since this game never takes itself too seriously, it’s also not as much about winning as about having fun.
And there’s plenty of it.

I have a soft spot for game designs that try to go in strange, new directions, and even if they're a little flawed, I still find them endearing.

Nuns on the Run is a fantastic game that I will rarely turn down, but it's a bit situational. I won't try to teach this to new or casual gamers (shame, because they're the ones who can get into the theme). And if I'm playing the nuns, well, I accept that I have almost no chance of winning. But I find this tonnes of fun, with tension and laugh-out-loud moments.

Nuns on the Run is almost an inverted Scotland Yard: The guards (an abbess and a prioress, controlled by a single player) move their markers around the convent while they try to nab the novices, who use hidden movement to run and sneak around and collect their secret wishes.
Very engrossing and nerve-racking game, with great 'story' element to get involved in. Best with 4 or more players.

It's basically reverse Scotland Yard or Fury of Dracula. Playing Dracula or Mr. X is so much more exciting, so I think this game improves on that concept by making the majority role a lot more exciting. Of course, the downfall to winning is you likely were never seen, so it can lack tension.

RATING: 5
One of the best experiences in board games is playing as Mr X in the classic Ravensburger title Scotland Yard. You are secretly moving around a map of London, trying to slip through the ever-tightening net of inspectors who are trying to capture you. It's hugely rewarding to escape, and extremely nerve-wracking as you watch and listen to them plot how to capture you, and speculate and guess as to where you are. The only trouble with that game is that there's only one Mr X, and playing as the inspectors is not nearly as fun.

Which brings us to Nuns on the Run. The designer took that great, rewarding aspect of Mr. X and made it so that the majority of the players in this game get that experience - one of hoping desperately not to be caught and enjoying slipping through the net of the 'guards'. For that alone, this game deserves high praise - it's very fun to play as the novices.

Just like in Scotland Yard though, playing as the guards isn't so great. It's fine, and it's good that only 1 person has to do it, but it's not nearly as fun.

The game is also full of procedural minutiae. You have checks for line-of-site, sound checks, die rolls for being heard, and various cards to select and flip and what-not. It takes all the simplicity out of the Scotland Yard model, and consequently is much more fiddly and more work to play (and takes a lot longer as well).

Overall, it's a good trade-off because of the thrill of being a sneaky novice, but the fiddliness overhead should not be ignored.

This is a nice concept for a game, kind of a reverse Scotland Yard (Mister X). It's more fun to be a novice then the Abbess or Prioress, since the latter have rather scripted moves and it seems very difficult for them to win.

Good inversion of Scotland Yard, an improvement enough that I prefer Nuns on the Run over SY.  It has some flaws (awkward line of sight rules, steeper learning curve, a few overlooked graphic design details), but it's still fun and doesn't overstay its welcome.  My favorite logic/deduction game for 5 or 6 players.

A very cute game of young nuns trying to get away with hijinks with the elder nuns trying to catch them.

Essentially, this is a Scotland Yard style game, where on player plays the elder nuns, with the young nuns secretly moving about the board.  If the older nuns get a sight line on a young nun, the position is revealed.  Additionally, there are dice rolls made where the older nuns might hear a sound coming from a certain direction (we decided the younger nuns have gas and occasionally rip one off), thus giving them a clue as to which direction they should head.

Overall, I'm just not a fan of deduction-type games, and while this definitely is much more light-hearted and not terribly deductiony, it just failed to get me excited.  I can possibly see it being more fun to play as the sneaky nuns rather than the grumpy old nuns, but I won't be seeking this one out.

This game absolutely puts the players into that abbey. You really do feel like a disobedient novice with contraband stuffed down her habit praying not to get caught by the merciless abbesses.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

Hide and seek in a board game! Initially seemed like this would favor the guards, but it actually feels fairly balanced - we'll see how that holds up with more plays!

The theme is funny and seems to interest people right off the bat. Always a good thing.

Tension actually runs fairly high in this one for the novices - which I think is a definite plus.

Took us a little bit to REALLY understand everything (including line of sight rules etc.) but once you get going this is really fun!

Bought this on a whim because it looked funny. I only did a two player version and the directions are not written so that you can understand how to play with just two players. Maybe I missed something. Well we played with one player being both guards and the other player being one novice. And that was ridiculous and it was really hard to get anything done. I can't imagine how the guards would have gotten more than one point. So I can't wait to play it with more than just two people. Because I think playing it with two people sucked. The directions also suck. They are not as clear as they could be. There's going to be a lot of trial-and-error. I like games you can just jump into, and this just had too much wishy-washy s*** going on. Even the line of sight thing is stupid because as you're playing the game, there are so many places on the board where you can't even tell what the heck it is you're looking at. So even the art isn't very good. It's too bad, because we really love Scotland Yard and I thought this would be similar but with some twists. Frankly I'm disappointed. But I'll give it another shot someday with more people. And I'll put more time into the Direction book and hopefully figure out the answers to the Myriad of questions I had.

A boardgame version of hide-and-seek. Quite a fun, light-hearted game though the ending usually feels like an anticlimax as you don't know where anyone else is. Winning does seem to be largely a matter of luck though I have been caught twice and had to stand still for three turns and still won in a game with 5 novices. Walking occasionally as the searcher is vital to get the noise clues which let you deviate from your set path. Using small bits of Lego or something to mark the doors can help new players visualise the lines of sight. The secret wish card with key number 3 would appear to be the hardest route to accomplish unseen.

This would have been even better if set in Hogwarts with Filch and Mrs Norris (or Professor Snape) patrolling for Gryffindor students (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, George and Fred) after lights-out, who are in turn looking for a flask of polyjuice potion, their confiscated Nimbus 2000, a box of Dr. Filibuster's Fireworks, a book from the restricted section of the library, a copy of 'Magical Me!' (to deface), etc. Blessing cards could be replaced by potions of speed (+1 movement), silence (-1 to noise roll) and luck (re-roll) and 'Peeves up to no good' (fake noise). The only thing that wouldn't quite work is that on a redrawn map the portrait hole entrance would act as a bottle neck.

RATING: 6
I really liked Scotland Yard as a kid. This game perked my interest because it shares the same neat mechanic of finding the hidden character. However, Nuns on the Run turns the table and pits one or two visible nuns against multiple, hidden players trying to sneak to a location and return to their room.

The result is a very thematic experience. The game perfectly captures the tension of "hide and seek," and you can feel every "novice" at the table caught up in the suspense. An absolutely wonderful game experience.

I should add that the rulebook has its flaws. And, our first two games were learning experiences, where we had to bumble through the vagaries around noise checks, line of sight issues (initially forgetting there were doors!), etc. etc. Also, the game shines best when there's 5+ people at the table. 

I was always running the nuns, but I finally got a chance to play the novices. While it's fun to be "on the hunt" as the guards, it's equally enjoyable to get your sneak on. This is a really unique game that is both thematic and flat-out fun.

Update: Tried this with the lunch crew and it fell totally flat. This one wasn't going to hit the table with any regularity, so I sold it off.

This is an odd game. For the most part you don't even see other players on the board. You'll occasionally see them make a sound or disappear, but for the most part it's just one player walking around the board (I forget what you call the character(s) they control), while everyone else writes down on paper where their character is. The point being to make it to two different locations on the board and back to your starting space the first. The whole game is played "on your honor", except that in theory you can audit it at the end. Except that the paper they give you doesn't even have enough columns for the data you actually need for an audit. You need the position, the type of move, and the die rolls. The paper doesn't have die rolls, so you have to add that if you really care about audit.

Anyway, this is a "ha ha" kind of game. And I'm just not a big fan of those kind of games. If I'm playing a 6-8 player game, I'd like to know what's going on with more than just one visible player.

This one vs. many game is really the reverse of the classic Scotland Yard.  Players play novice nuns who try to negotiate their way through the abbey to grab a key and then her special wish.  But prowling around to enforce the rules are the grouchy abbess and prioress.

The clever mechanism here is that players must choose how fast to move - the faster they move, the more likely they will be heard.  Noises are just as dangerous to the novices as being spotted!

There are definitely some challenges figuring out finer details ("Can I be heard here?") which can cause problems because players can't really discuss them, unless you send the abbess player out of the room.  That being said, I think this is nice, quick fun and it's great that the game scales up to 8 players.  Fits a niche in our collection, for sure.

Components: Wonderful board with clever and entertaining details hidden throughout. Very thematic. The cards leave something to be desired. For the nuns, the walking/running cards could just be one double-sided card. And their path cards are difficult for novices to see from across the table (and their paths on the board should each have a unique color). For the novices, the movement cards could be double-sided, and emphasize the numeric information (distance, noise) rather than the novice's face.

Experience: Very difficult to play honestly, as it is too easy to make mistakes (moving too far, using the wrong card, rolling for noise even when the nuns are running, determining if one is in earshot, and worst of all, line of sight without revealing my position). If the penalty for making a mistake is to forfeit, I'd say this game should only be played on the computer. The idea of auditing the game in the end to catch any mistakes made is really tedious.

It is mildly entertaining to creep around as a novice, but it is boring to be the nun; there just isn't any information to go on, and unless the nun gets lucky hearing a noise, they are bound to walk their pre-determined paths. The secret wishes are not all created equal.

A fun hidden-movement game that our lunch time gaming group has a lot of fun with.  Playing a nun is much different than playing a novice, and both are fun for their own reasons.  Sometimes as a nun it feels like the novices could be anywhere, while as a novice, you get the feeling that you're trapped in a closest trying not to make a sound while the pursuit is right outside the door.

Good review on why this won't be a casual game. http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/517594/miss-casual-gamer

TODO: print line of sight booklet.

Not as fun playing as the guards. Potential house rules:

- Play with Monk expansion (deaf guard from garden gate to {script/pharm/kitchen} back to garden gate)

- Play with Monk expansion + variant (Monk can add noise to guards)

- Novice ALWAYS roll for noise

- Novice can't run twice in a row (except first turn).

- Novice double move only for newbies?

- Novice can only open locked door matching key.. but then Outside area is closed off.

- Novice moving through doors add modifiers (run +2, walk +1)

- Caught novice reduces overall number of game rounds.

- Guards hide path picked.

- Guards auto-get the false noise blessing

- Guards move first?

- Guards get a min 3 for noise roll when walking

- Guards get a max 3 for noise roll when running?

RANDOM FUN 
- guards close eyes, and novices show their tokens every 5 turns.

- Print out personal reference maps for novices http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56141/reference-map

This game is super fun! We had trouble with the rules initially so we've kind of made our own house rules for it that we prefer. For example, we don't display the nuns' routes but depending on the number of players we display their starting positions. Sometimes on games night we just play as many games of Nuns as we possibly can. I would love to see more games like this one, expansions, or new maps.

*Very* enjoyable for the players who get to play a Novice. Guards are designed to win less often, so that lowers the score a little.

Regrettably, this game is fiddly to the max. Line of sight, when/where to place noises and vanish tokens, and the rules surrounding being caught are easy to get mixed up and have way too many exceptions.

Got this for Christmas 2011.  It's a fun game that accommodates up to 8 players, so it's nice to be able to bring it out when we have a lot of people playing.  With fewer players, it's difficult (if not impossible) for the 'guards' to win.  When we play with fewer players, we've begun implementing the 'winded rule', which makes it so the novices can't play two running actions back to back to give the 'guards' a fighting chance.

Cool game in theory, but there are too many chances to mess up and line of sight is a mess. The board does a horrible job of highlighting the blind spots and obstacles to line of sight. I'm glad there is a chart on the back of the rulebook, but this shows how inelegant and fiddly the game is. Still a pretty fun game as long as there aren't a whole bunch of people learning the game at once.

Nuns on the run is actually very good but there are major issues for me:
- The rules are not very precise and line of sight of the nun (the guard) is not visual enough (behind the door or on a tree) so it's confusing
- With all the players doing hidden moves, there's too much room for mistakes that cannot be repaired by others (i'm not mentioning voluntarily cheating which here is totally possible)
The game, though, is fun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice idea for a game that does not work well in practice. It is not for casual gamers or young family members, as it depends entirely upon novice nuns repeatedly making accurate line-of-sight and noise determinations, which are not trivial. The potential for giving mistaken information is far greater than in, say, Clue or Sleuth. (To be fair, inaccurate info in Clue or Sleuth is likely to ruin the game, whereas in Nuns on the Run, you merely will have more difficulty catching a novice than you should. The game probably will not be ruined.) Also, the more novices you have, the more tedium is involved in figuring out the line of sight and noise range for each novice as applied to each guard.

(Needs more plays) After one play, this game is horrible for the hunter player. The die rolls seem out of whack as 50% of the time on the sound check the die roll will be too low to matter and on top of this is tacked the die modifiers. There is no "surfacing" for the novices which means finding them is entirely luck based. I'm not certain but I believe the paths the guards can take weigh heavier to one side of the board. After one play, it seems like the novice side might be fun, but the guard side is dull and tedious. This was a 3 player game with 2 novices. I suspect that more novices makes things more interesting for the guards. At this point, I believe the guards need something more to increase the "find and pursue" part of the game.

This is a hard one to comment on.  Not quite like any other game I've played.  An interesting contrast between programmed and hidden movement. Now, I've only played this from the side of the Abbess/Prioress, not the Novices, so I can't comment on that.  I know it's frustrating when you absolutely know where one of the novices is hiding but, since no one's made a noise, you have to walk right by them on your programmed route.  But overall, this seemed to be a very big hit w/ our game group.  A huge selling point is that it can play up to 8 players, w/o taking all night like Duel of Ages or Arkham Horror.  I really like this game, and would play it in a heartbeat with my game group, but I don't see myself buying it.

There's some things to really like about this game...the board, theme, components, and general idea.  Haven't seen many games with this kind of hide-and-seek mechanism.  That said, I'm not sure it works that well.  If you get some unlucky rolls, and get heard...and captured..you will basically not have much chance of winning.  I guess that's the price you pay for pressing your luck.  But once you get caught once, you really have to press otherwise there is no chance of winning. There's also the possibility that players will make a mistake and move incorrectly...and it won't get noticed.  This is possible in most hide-and-seek games but moreso in this game due to all players secretly recording their moves and types.  That said, it is a fun game, but something I'd have to be in the right mood to play.

Played this game recently..it had been awhile and we had to read the rules to figure out how to play....lots of gaps in the rulebook.

Players play either naughty novice nuns on the loose at night, or the Abbess/Prioress patrolling the abbey and trying to catch the novices.  Simple game where the novices secretly plot their moves on a record sheet, then roll a die to see how much noise they make.  If a nun hears them, noise tokens are placed on the board in the direction the noise came from.  Nuns must move on pre-defined paths, but can depart if they hear or see something.  A novice wins if they accomplish their secret goal, and the nun player wins if they capture a number of novices.  Great idea for a game, but doesn't quite pull it off.  The nun player must get some help from the die rolls, otherwise it's over real quick, and the line of sight rules can get a bit tricky and accidentally break the game.  Good fun though, and different!

Hide-and-seek on a board. While the concept itself is fun and the theme funny, feel as though the game development isn't quite there. There's a lot missing or hard to see, a lot of fiddly components and rules convoluted to say the least (despite reading extensively through the forums).

RATING: 6.5
A fun but not very serious game, it's great both for those who don't play board games, and those who do when you don't want a mentally taxing game.  I play it more frequently than some "better" games because of ease of play, fun factor, and relatively short play time.  It's a good wind-down game after a night of more demanding games.

It's best played with the full number of players, otherwise it is far too hard for the Abbess/Prioress.  If you don't have the full number of players, I strongly suggesting having people play multiple novices.

Better theme suggestion: Castle Wolfenstein!

The genius of this game is that it is more fun to be the one sneaking around, and in this game everyone but one player gets to sneak.  The drawback is that the line-of-sight is unnecessarily fiddly due to the design of the board, and the game can easily be ruined by players misjudging line of sight.  It's not like a player can ask for clarification without giving their position away, either.  

This game should have used something like the Tannhauser system for clarifying line of sight (hmm, maybe I could mod the board? Feels like too much work), or just settled for a simpler map. 

UPDATE: I'm afraid this game is falling between the cracks for me in the "Hide and Seek" genre.  With gamers, I'd rather play Letters from Whitechapel or Fury of Dracula.  With my kids, I'd rather play Ghost Chase or Flurch Der Mummie.  Nuns on the Run was supposed to be my casual gamer game of this type.  The problem is, it is just too fiddly and too easy for Nun players to make a mistake.  They can't ask questions during the game without spoiling things (giving away their position), and that is the kiss of death for "gateway games."  I realized this when I had the perfect group of 6 casual gamers, and passed NotR on by because I didn't want to try to teach and referee it.  How are you ever supposed to use the line of sight ruler that comes with the game without giving away your position, anyway?  Consequently, this game is neither well suited for competitive nor casual play.

I stand by my "Tannhauser" comment above!

This is easily my most unique game. Somehow the designer has managed to shove an entire elementary-school-recess sized game of hide-n-seek into a plain medium euro cardboard box. Quite impressive to say the least. You actually feel like a little kid running and hiding in a large empty building. There's the tension, the mystery, and the chance for your friend to give your perfect position away... fool!

[b]8.2.10 Update:[/b] I was worried about how this would play with only 4 players. I'm happy to report it was good enough to not shy away from anymore.

[b]8.9.10 Update:[/b] I dropped this rating a little due to the fact that it takes forever to explain this game to new players. As a game explainer on this one, you have to take your time and be very clear since during the game you won't be able to correct any misplayed rules since everything is hidden.

[b]9.8.14 Update:[/b] This hit the table for the first time in forever. Thankfully teaching and setup went much smoother than I remembered thankfully due to my Short_Guide. Everyone loved it!

Great game.It even gives a paranioa feeling (Is someone looking at me while I am planing my next move?!?). We had very much fun playing. The only things I didn't like were: the game needs at least 5 players to be fun - otherwise you miss interaction, especially when playing the part of the Abbess or Prioress. And if dice hate you, your chance to stay uncovered is very low.

My new favourite game!  My first 'hidden movement' game, and I really had the feeling of creeping around in the dark trying to figure out where everyone else might be.  Great fun with a large group willing to play with the theme.

The only problem was the difficulty for new players to check whether their moves or line-of-sight declarations are legitimate - expect some mistakes on the first play.  I'm really looking forward to playing this again.

Rules need significant revision -- there are several important issues that are not addressed, even in passing, and the overall layout is less than ideal. Definitely plays better with more players (5+) than with fewer (2-4). 

That said, Nuns on the Run can be enjoyable game of cat and mouse, even if certain elements are a little clunky. The guards are no fun to play, but can be automated pretty easily via houserules. I'd also recommend employing a single dice roll in place of all players individually rolling dice (when appropriate).

On one hand, it seems like a game aimed at non-gamers but it's way too complicated from my experience for that. This game occupies an odd space that we call "the family game for wargamers." There are always LOS and door issues whenever we play. This is not a game I'd attempt with non-gamers.

The reason I like the game is that it does a very good job of rendering a hide-n-seek experience that is unique among games. The tension is nice and the fiascoes the novices create for each other by drawing a nun over and catching someone else is a big part of the fun. [i]You idiot, what are you doing here? [/i]

Where the experience falls apart is as a competitive game. The secret wishes are simply not balanced and exacerbated by the routes the nuns choose. You can start off in great shape or having to waste turns stalling early on, and a frequent result is that a bunch of players are getting into and out of tight spots while one player quietly and efficiently wins the game with little or no tension. 

Now we play with our "All or Nun" variant (see the Variants forum) whereby all the novices have to get out or else the Nun player wins. This amps the tension up nicely and keeps everyone engaged until the end, even those players who've already escaped. The game is well balanced this way too.

As part of the variant, after we write down our moves we have the Nun player close their eyes while we all point to where we are. This creates a lot of laughter and tension once we see where all are in relation to one another; highly recommended.

I rate this a 4 after one play but it could easily grab several more points with some repeated play.

I played as the nuns and felt I could do very little to stop or slow the novices. I had two incredibly frustrating moments where I knew precisely where a novice was but couldn't move any further off my trail, forcing me to waste several turns. I also felt if I spent time slowing one player, I was just making an opening for another. It seems the strategy as the nuns requires knowing exactly the fastest paths to each potential key and covering those for the first couple turns. Since that is set in stone, it seems the nuns first couple turns will always be the same. Also, the noise aspect could really burn the nuns with one poor roll.

I'm not above playing the game again but I've told my game group I won't play again until it's played without me and they agree it has any semblance of balance.

1st play: 6. Not a bad game, and will be better next time when it goes faster. The rules are a bit finicky to explain but once you learn how to play, you'll wonder how you ever thought it was finicky. I'll give more detailed feedback on my next play.
2nd play: 6. Still not a home-run, but it is unique, does a decent job of the theme in a short time-frame, and is fun enough to play. Traded my copy after this play as it doesn't have enough "wow" to get me playing it often.

[1 play]I just don't see how it is possible for the nuns to win with 5 + players.  There are just too many people.  By the time the Nuns catch one or two novices, the rest are already doing the moon walk back into their rooms and we had the experienced player running the nuns.  It's a great idea, though.  Just needs some tweaking somewhere.

Scotland Yard in reverse - the many hiding novices move secretly and the few searching nuns move openly on the board. After the novices move they roll a die in order to determine how much noise they made. If the novices take their turns sequentially the game drags a bit. I suspect it would play far smoother if all novices plotted their moves at once and only the noise die was done sequentially. Hope to try it that way someday. Suspect my rating would improve if that works.

Way too fiddly, seems heavily slanted to the success of the young nuns - as the mother superior and her aid really run on tracks, and fails in comparison to other secret movement titles.  

Although it is essentially the opposite of your Scotland Yard types games the experiment didn't pan out this time.

A Harry Potter theming would be perfect.

Hide and Seek the boardgame, this is a fun thematic hidden movement game where most players sneak around and then 1 or two move openly trying to find the rest.

Pretty fun. Both seeking and hiding can be difficult depending on how many players. (With larger numbers it is hard to be hiders and win, while it is harder to be the seekers and win with lower numbers of players.) Fun hide and seek for those rainy days. 
Worst aspect of the game is the rules. They are not clear on quite a few things. Especially on what happens when a nun hears you or sees you vanish. What actions can they take and what order? Do they have to take he whole move or do they catch you so long as they pass over you? Do they stop as soon as they land on you etc.

A twist on the same mechanic as Letters from White Chapel and Scotland Yard.  Ok, once you got it figured out.  I'd play it again, but not really often.  I wouldn't own it, or subject it to others.  The line of sight thing is overly complicated with hiding in trees, behind things and around corners, that you wouldn't know about without extensive rulebook reading.

I played it solo by simulating a 4 player game to familiarize myself with the rules and really enjoyed it. Somehow I got all of the rules right...judging from the queries and clarifications in the forums. I think the artwork on the board, attractive as it is, should have been more functional (Walls and Doors highlighted with a color border for instance) to make LOS clearer. As a person who has played and really likes Scotland Yard/Mister X/New York Chase, I think I like the mechanics of this game more. I look forward to teaching it to my students and friends. I’ve rated it unusually high considering I have yet to play it in a group simply because I really want to play it again and I’ve rarely gotten that feeling from playing games solo.

RATING: 5
Scotland Yard in reverse, but while Scotland Yard is a deduction game, this is much more luck based as the noise the novices make is based on a 1-6 die roll. If you're lucky enough not to make a sound then the Abbess and Prioress have to walk a fixed track and that's trivial to avoid. All of that said, this game has fun in spades and is a great way to spend an hour. Recommended as a light diversion.

Purchased at GenCon 2015, this is a game of stealth and the honor system. The theme comes across well from the art on the cards as well as the mechanics themselves. Hide from the abbess and prioress, roaming to find initiates out of their cells. Players must note their progress to themselves as they proceed, however, so they must be able of playing mistake-free for the game to hold water. A great deal of fun for those looking for a light game with suspense and laughs.

It's...okay. While there is a lot to consider when making your decisions, complicated by the fact that everything is unseen, success on either end comes down to a lot of RNG, and bad rolls make a sound strategy worthless. If you have a logic expert on the patrol that relies on vision and isolation (rather than dumb luck, which can also happen), you are in for it. Otherwise, the player can take a mostly direct route for whatever reason should win easily.

EDIT: Revised down. Every other game that tries to do something similar does it at least marginally better than this one.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (July 2010)

This one (as almost all Moyersoen´s games I have played) has been dropping and dropping in my ratings (Initial Rating 7.5), I never liked the theme and nowadays I don’t feel any compulsion to play this. It’s not a bad game but I don’t enjoy it. The playtime is long and mistakes from players can really mess up the game, also, once a novice is caught it is very easy to catch her again and again. And I almost forgot, the rules are awful and leave many questions unresolved.

After another play I have to drop the rating again. The down time is excessive with more than 4 players, also if you are caught you are effectively out of the race, is like player elimination but worse because you still have to endure the game and move even though you have no chance to win. If I’m going to play for more than 2 hours I would like the game to be a lot meatier than this.

All things considered I will do every effort to never play this again, but many in my game group like it :(.

RATING: 6
Hidden movement game in the same genre as Scotland Yard, Garibaldi, Letters from Whitechapel etc.

That the hidden players are playing for themselves rather than as a team is a new dynamic and a nice twist on the norm.

As one of the hidden players I found my options were contrained by how my hidden objectives (which basically specify which two spaces on the board you must visit before returning home) aligned with the 'guard' nuns' movement. The winning player had objective spaces that seemd to naturally take him away from the paths the player controlling the guards took, and I wonder how often this would be the case.

There seemed to be some vagueness about the line of sight rules that I coudn't clear up by referring to the chart in the rules, and didn't want to clear up by putting the ruler on the board as it would have given my position away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Never again.  Having to use the line of sight chart is incredibly tedious.  Plus, it's very easy for someone to make a "mistake" with the chart.  You don't know were any of your competitors are, so you have no idea if you should press your luck or play conservatively.

I pulled this one out at a family gathering recently, so I got to play this six player. It took almost as long to go through the rules as it did to play our first game. But by about five turns in the game began to flow and the richness of the game began to shine. This game reminds me as lot of Scotland yard...But instead of everyone chasing one hidden person....one person is looking for everyone else. ..who is hidden :)
Now I know how to play this game, it would be quite an easy one to teach. 
The game itself is built well and the art is nice and inviting. 
We did to find the doors a little tricky at first but we really liked the one spot where you could hide in a tree. All in all I enjoyed this one and will play it again for sure :)

2016-07-11 - I like hidden movement games well enough, but frequently feel as though they take a bit too long. Nuns on the Run is an interesting twist in that most of the players are hidden and only two guards are visible on the board. I played as the guards and it was not easy to catch the novices running around, but I think that's a skill you can build. I would like to play as a novice to see how that feels. Will definitely play this again.

Instead of all other players going after the hidden thief, this reworking of Scotland Yard has one open player going after the hidden others. Abbesses have to travel along set paths unless they see the sneaking novices, which is a cool switch to the game mechanic.. but the pathway rules are a bit vague as to what happens when done. Sadly, this one doesn't really have challenge level to encourage repeated plays.

PLUS: improved Scotland Yard mechanic
MINUS: not an effective draw for repeated play

RATING: 4
Hunter vs. hunted game similar to Scotland Yard and Fury of Dracula, but not nearly as good as either of those games. On the surface, this is a simple game of cat and mouse with the Novices trying to outwit the Abbess and the Prioress. The fiddly rules for line of sight, listening and making noises, vanish markers, special blessings, caught vs. uncaught statuses all contribute admirably to the theme, but mechanically feel a bit of a mess. It leads to constant counting and re-recounting down different paths to find out what is visible or what is in hearing range. The special blessings are not usable by all players, which seems like a poor design choice. The game has good humor and that's the best thing going for it I think. Not enough in my book. Enjoy the simple elegance of Scotland Yard instead.

And here come the naughty novices racing down the hallway! What's that in their hands? Jack's best new game of the month? Quick, after them, before they lock themselves in the scriptorium!

Nuns on the Run is a hilarious and well-designed game of hide and seek. One player takes the role of the abbess and prioress as they patrol the hallways. The other players sneak around as novices looking for their secret wish, be it a confiscated love letter or a flask of whiskey. To win, a novice must obtain a specific key, use that key to obtain their secret wish, and return to their room undetected. If they are caught along the way, they are not eliminated from the game but instead are scolded and sent back toward their room, which merely costs them time before they run amok again. The abbess/prioress player wins after catching novices five times.

This game works for two reasons. First, the abbess and prioress must select a patrol path as they move. Let's say one path leads from the Chapel to the kitchen. They cannot deviate from that path unless they hear or see one of the novices. So the novice players (quite reasonably) have some idea of where the seekers are going, at least until the next path is chosen in the kitchen. But what they don't know is exactly how quickly the abbess/prioress are moving or how much noise they themselves will make. Noise depends both on the rate of movement (standing/sneaking/walking/running) and a die roll. So there's planning (patrol routes) and risk management (noise, rate of movement). As far as I can tell, it works brilliantly.

About the only thing I can say against Nuns on the Run is that a novice player can easily lose if another player is bad at the game and gets caught repeatedly. But as a wild, entertaining experience that plays quickly and offers something different from the norm, I can forgive that. Also note that this is more fun with more players. I would not go lower than four and think 5-6 is probably best. Best game of 2010 so far.

Hated it, traded it.  couldn't get over the following paradox:  easy game aimed at social groups and non-gamers, while simultaneously being really open to giving false information that can send the game straight to hell.  The people i played with didn't TRY to ruin the game, they were just younger players or non-gamers.  And they're trying to not get caught.  So they do the best they can, maybe there's a little wishful thinking, and it's kind of impossible to know if they "cheated" or if they CHEATED, or if the guards just got unlucky.  Meh.

I like the unusual theme, the author seems to have a pretty good knack for choosing themes.  The artwork is satisfactory though the box is very annoying - the insert sits too high, causing the board to protrude over the top of the box bottom, but that is a very petty concern.

I enjoy the game and find that it offers something somewhat different.  In games like Garibaldi or Scotland Yard, it is probably more fun to play the person on the run, where as here multiple players get to do that, so that is a nice touch.  I can see how it can be pretty tense at times, especially with the noise unpredictability.

That said, the main deficiency, in my opinion, is the somewhat involved rules set for such a simple game.  Though this is probably best enjoyed as a family game, until I get better at the game I fear that the length and depth of the rules explanation would be difficult for some people to swallow.  Also, the interaction is kind of low, since everyone is keeping track of their own movement, though other people can affect what you're doing.  I can see how mistakes in notation or a simple rules misunderstanding could be problematic.  Also, it would be easy for an unattentive player to forget to reveal themselves (or their noises), so all players need to pay attention and be honest for the game to work right.

After several plays I am adjusting my score down.

Nun’s on The Run seems like a game that was a great idea, that has not quite been fully thought through. I am not too sure how I would fix it but I would start with making the board simpler, the doors more visible and maybe address the rules by looking at how intuitive they are. I understand that the rules are in fact very simple, but for some reason one spends the entire game clarifying them, this has happened with each play. A less secure individual would question his teaching style, but I think there is something counter intuitive to the rules because players always seem to need clarification and often their assumptions around how things work are wrong. That said I like the art, theme and the concept very much.

This game is deceptively fun!
It is a hidden movement game, where you write your movements down on a piece of paper, rather than moving yourself on the board so everyone can see it.  
It's basically hide and go seek / capture the flag.

Players sneak around the board trying not to make any noise, if you make noise, you may give away your location, and the guards will find you.
There is a certain sense of anticipation that I didn't expect, as the guards closed in on my location and I was hiding trying not to make a sound.  

There is a level of trust in the game, that everything you do is legit!  The purpose of writing down everything you do in the game is to review afterwards to make sure you didn't cheat...  But by that time the game is over and it doesn't really matter...  

Great Game!  Highly Recommend it!

RATING: 5
Nice idea but seemes flawed. 

* Getting caught (often down to a bad die roll) means you are pretty much out of the game as it is too hard to get yourself to a safe position to go on the run again.
* The line of site rules are too complex and confusing for such a simple game.
* Bad rules with lots of grey areas and gaps.
* Seems to come down to getting lucky on the first turn or two. No chance to come back if you get caught early - as everyone knows exactly where you are...
* Finally, if 2 (or more people) play 'well' and don't get caught the winner is simply the one who had the best card/starting location combo and there is nothing anyone else can do about it.

This is a fun game that emulates the thrills of hide and seek very well. The theme and fun factor could appeal immensely to non-gamers or light-gamers. 

Unfortunately, the rules are a little fiddly which makes it tricky to teach to those who aren't dedicated. I think this is the main reason why this game hasn't been hitting the table as often as it should.

Nuns on the Run is a like a reverse of Scotland Yard. Players play either as a novice, or as the Abbess or Prioress. The Novices move in secret and avoid being seen or heard by the Abbess or Prioress. The goal is to make it to the location on the board where the novice can get her "secret wish" and return to their room without being detected. All of the novices move in secret by marking their movement and locations on hidden sheets. The Abbess and Prioress move on regulated paths around the board, but can diverge and chase down novices that they see or hear. The player or players who complete their secret wishes and return to their rooms win, or the Abbess and Prioress win if they catch a certain number of novices.

6 :( 
I WANTED MORE: We really love the secret movement aspect of the game. It's just that the rounds are over too quickly and it seems that there is always a player with a random advantage in the beginning that can just run everywhere and be back in about 9 or 10 moves. The game feels very unbalanced with many cool aspects never taking on major roles in the game.

7.5 :)
We fixed this with a new House Rule: Use all the movement cards. We set the movement cards aside as we use them, once all types of movements have been played, pick them up and start over. This makes the game longer, adds another level of strategic planning, and makes the nuns have a chance at catching you. This makes the game so much better I feel like we were always supposed to be doing this. Did I just miss it in the rules?

If you have someone to teach this well and who understand the nuances, this game is not too long.  It's a fairly unique game of cat-and-mice with two cats (nuns) and up to six mice (novices).  But, each novice is fighting for themselves so they are not just trying to avoid the nuns but also prefer the other novices to get caught, instead of themselves.  The visual line-of-sight checks and listening checks makes things interesting.  It's fun but I can see how folks may not like how fiddly it could be if no one is familiar with the rules, map layout and special locations.

RATING: 7
As a sleuthing/deduction game, this one is brilliant. My low score really just reflects that I'm not in the mood for this type of game very often. When I am in the mood, this is a top choice.

Essentially, Nuns on the Run is like an inversion of Scotland Yard. Most players are trying to sneak around the abbey without getting caught, while one player (or two) controls the Abbess and the Prioress, on patrol to catch novices sneaking around after dark. Players playing as novices move in secret, recording their moves on notepaper. The game board is tight, and the most direct route anywhere typically involves the greatest risk of detection, while going the long way, which is safer, can also mean running out of time.

What makes this game great is that the novices don't know where their co-conspirators are, and this makes for some tense and exciting moments when the noises made by one player inadvertently put the Abbess/Prioress on the trail of another player. Of course, this also means that a perfect strategy can easily be foiled by another player, which deduction purists might not like, but the consequences are immeasurably fun. Add 15 minutes to the game time; after playing, players will want to debrief, and talk about the path they took, and where the tension was.

Gives the feeling of hide and seek without all the running around. :) Silly Novices running around for their secret wishes while they are pursued by the senior Nuns of the Abbey. 
The only major issue I have with this game, is the anti-climatic feel at the end. One of the novices just announces that 'I am done' and boom game over. There is no run for the finish line. Otherwise the game is very fun and can be played with a lot of people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Good game for a group.  Has a good co-op feel, since it's all the novices vs. the guards, and yet the novices are each trying to win separately.  Also like that it accommodates 8 players without much downtime for anyone.

LOS rules are tricky at first, and I think there need to be some better/charts clarifications on how they work.  My rating would be higher if not for this.

I love the concept because I love hidden movement games and this gives you a chance to have multiple people moving at once rather than just one.  Simple to play, clever handling of sight and sound from movement.  The only thing that bothers me is the complexity of line of sight in the open areas like the cloister.

RATING: 9
Been a hit with both groups I've played with so far. It's not as analytical as Scotland Yard, but it's more fun. Heaps more fun than Ghost Chase, too. Great idea to have the majority of player move secretly, rather than the usual reverse. It's not a game where you're going to find a lot of hidden strategies with multiple playings, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's simply nuns being naughty, and you have to catch them.

This is a reasonably fun game.  It's easy for people to pick up on the rules and get into the gameplay.  Definitely a lighter game, but it has a much broader appeal than other games and is considerably easier to get non-gamers to play.  I'm not very good at this game, which lessens my personal excitement about it, but there's nothing really bad about it.  I'm worried that it'll lose its appeal as more experienced players dominate the beginners, but otherwise, this game provides a very enjoyable experience.

Comments after first play: Only played the Abbess+Prioress side, it was great fun to try and hunt down the novices. Really great mechanics regarding spotting novices (the nuns on the run) and hearing them make noises (the nuns don't actually leave their cell on the board, but plan secret movements on a notepad, and only when they are seen their marker is placed on their current spot, until they leave vision again). The nuns-players said it was almost scary at sometimes when they were almost spotted/heard, and being chased after.

Great Game--plays like a game of hide n seek between teams (nuns and novices). Not a lot of table talk, which usually is a deal-breaker, but is okay for this type of game. Can be a bit demoralizing if novice players continually get caught.

Was really fun the first time, but dies very fast. The game can be broken by players just messing up what they write down.

RATING: 8
Extremely fun game that is actually "fun" to play. A lot of laughing and talking during the game that adds to the experience.

The game itself is pretty (the board especially) and makes for a great family game, as well as a more serious gamers' game. As a filler, that is.

However, I'm not so sure it'll stand a lot of plays, though. There's only a few locations and key locations, and this would possibly make it stale rather too quickly.

Still, I can't wait to own my a copy of this!

EDIT: own a copy and it's awesome!

Hidden movement, fun and lighthearted theme and lots of tension. This is just an all-around fun game.

The downside is that the rules are JUST dense enough to be a little unfriendly to newbies, and the doors on the map REALLY need to stand out more. It's not uncommon for the nun player to be moving, have an acolyte say "You see me down this hallway...err...there's a door there? Um. Nevermind, you saw nothing."

RATING: 8
Really digging this. A lot of theme and tension as the nuns try to sneak about without getting caught.Great cuz it plays 8. Has caused much frivolity most times we've played.  I think it's a little better game in the higher range of number of players, say 5 or more, but it's not bad with less players.  The game is tilted a bit in favor of the novices, and the player(s) who play the guards have a little bit less to do, but playing either is fun.  Just a little tedious if you're always teaching the game b/c you usually wind up being the guards. But once your group knows the game people will start wanting to try the guards out.

this game is lots of fun, playing a novice makes you get giddy when the abbess and prioress are within earshot of you. the noise portion keeps it exciting (and not completely luck) for the prioress player to not feel like they are just wandering around in the dark.

A novel concept for a boardgame (and one that takes seven to suit an an expanding game group) and not bad fun.

The theme doesn't do a lot for me and I didn't think I'd be that into the whole hidden movement thing, but was pleasantly surprised as my first and, so far, only game was quite good.

Not one that I'd push to have on the table, but one I enjoyed it well enough

Hide and seek game. Great looking game board and it brings variety to the board game collection. 
Be fast when controlling the abbess and prioress! +  Don't make the same mistake as me: I tried to find the logic behind the listen rules. They are illogical (the abbess and prioress are completely deaf when walking). Just play, and be fast. I suspect that children may like it better than adults will.

A light, one-vs-all hidden-movement game that is fast to play and doesn't over-stay it's welcome.  There's actually not much here: it's not deeply strategic nor is it as tense and tactical as Letters From Whitechapel; but it's a pretty fun hidden movement game that fits in 45 minutes.

RATING: 5
Neat idea but the whole line of sight calculations ruined the experience for me.  In games such as Scotland Yard, one player has to be constantly making sure his hidden moves are accurate.  In Nuns on the Run, now you have many players who are tracking their hidden movements which just seems to increase the odds of a mistake being made.

Best hidden movement game I've ever played.  I prefer that the majority of the players are hidden and you have a few roving guards who are visible.  I also like the fact that a guard may hear a noise, head in the direction of the noise, and potentially reveal multiple students hiding in the same area at the same time and then trying to catch as many as possible before they all scatter.

The line of sight can be a bit wonky sometimes but it's definitely playable.  The areas that have the most room for error also come on a handy chart on the back page.

Surprisingly good game on the nightly whereabouts of some young novice nuns as they sneak out their cells to look for their secret wishes... I liked it more than I had expected. The game rules are quite clear, all by all it doesn't take long to play and the theme really works well for this game! My gaming group was very enthusiast after our first play so I have a feeling this title will often hit our gaming table. PLUS: it's made in Belgium, so don't forget to enjoy a Belgian abbey beer (or Trappist) when you're playing...

A family game of excellent proportions - this game should have a place in the pantheon of gateway games, it has gone down very well with all non-gamers we've tried it with. The game itself feels very exciting and fun, it is silly but you feel almost giddy when the prioress walks past you and you remain unseen. The only downside with the game is the fuzzy board due to murky colors which makes it very hard to see where there are doors and where there are not - in several games people have declared themselves in the line of sight, while in fact being behind a door.

I really enjoy Nuns on the Run. I have played it several times, both as a novice and as the Prioress/Abbess. It is a very fun party game that puts you constantly on the edge of your seat, hoping that the Nun won't find you hiding in the confessional. Really the exciting part of the game is replaying the game after to show everyone where you were and how close you were to getting caught. My only issue is that with the limited number of secret items and keys, it makes it relatively easy for some novices while much more difficult for others.

RATING: 7
Nuns On The Run inverts the conventions of Scotland Yard, making the hunter the 1 in these 1-vs.-many games. In doing so it removes any cooperation between the Many and creates a hilarious chaos as their pursuit of individual goals can disrupt each others play, exposing them to the hunter. Unlike other games in this genre NotR has every player thoroughly involved. Plus, its shorter than the others.

Fun and interesting one-v-all hidden movement game. I like this style of game, and the theme (although unusual) comes through well. 

It's pretty luck-based, but that's fine. A bigger problem is new players finding it very difficult to ask rules/line-of-sight questions (and there tend to be quite a few) without giving away where they are.

One person plays the Colditz type guards patrolling along their routes, whilst all the others are moving around a Scotland Yard type board (containing 150 or so numbered locations) to their secret "key" locations, then to their destination, then back home, first home wins. Moving is revealing how fast you're moving via cards and writing your new location down secretly, again Scotland Yard style. Then roll a die and if there's a guard within that many spots (less a modifier that's larger if you moved less), then they get to come off their stated route around the board and move towards you, hoping to land on you. So there's your first bit of luck, the die roll, but the major piece of luck is whether the guards are near you when you need to move around in the open (if they can see you, they can chase and capture you). With a bunch of players, someone's going to get lucky and simply race through their route fast, whilst others are forced to stop, hide, take detours, etc, to avoid the guards. So the game's a lottery. At least it doesn't take that many turns to resolve. A bit of a downer playing the guard as well, as the decisions you make are all guesses - which route to take; which path to explore if you "hear" something in that direction. All in all it's a pass, as in it passes the time fine, but there's not a lot to offer in terms of fun, angst or quality decision making.

Lots of fun! Two nuns (Abbess and Prioress) chase the six novices as they sneak around trying to get a key, then a secret wish and finally try to return to their rooms. All this without being caught. The Abbess and the Prioress follow fixed paths, unless of course they hear or see someone who should not be out of their room, in which case they can deviate from their path. Plays with a large group (up to eight) and los of fun.

This is a Scotland Yard-type hidden movement game, but it's purely competitive.  Each "novice" player is trying to fulfill a secret goal by hitting a few points on the map in order, while each "nun" player is trying to catch the novices a certain number of times.  Unfortunately for the nuns, their movement is very constrained, making it very difficult for them to win.  Like many hidden-movement games, mistakes (unintentional or not) cannot be discovered until the end of the game, when it's too late to fix them.  Also, the game is prone to many-way ties at the end.  This game has some nice concepts, but isn't really my style.

Love the game, but I have found it common for people to commit mistakes while playing it. Definitely not an introductory game. I love the theme, and it really conveys the feeling of being chased.

I liked the game. But the fact that you must check every step may cause the guards players guess where you are.
Besides it, the board is dark and because of that is hard to see whether a door is open or not. It helps the guards too. Maybe the guards paths should be not continuous through doors that are closed. This would help to determine if the door is open.

Decent hidden movement game. The cat-and-mouse movements feel a bit too restricted on the hunters' side, though. I also don't really like the end conditions, where the game ends when one person wins. It feels like play should continue until the last round so everyone else can try to finish their objectives before time runs out. Especially since you can't tell where everyone else is, someone can win suddenly and it feels like "That's it? I guess I don't get to see what happens with my objective that I've been playing toward for the last hour. Oh well."

Nuns on the Run is the most suspenseful game that I've played in quite some time.  I delight in the suspenseful moments when I'm hiding behind the Abbess or the Prioress and wondering if she is going to turn around.  

Sometimes the secret wishes seem a little unbalanced, and it is possible  that a novice can win the game in a few short turns if he/she gets lucky on the wish draws and where the Abbess and the Prioress roam.  

The excitement surrounding whether or not the other novices are going to ruin my plans keeps me interested throughout the whole process.  Also, Nuns on the Run plays quickly because the majority of the players are taking their turns simultaneously.  It's usually pretty quick to figure out where you'd like to move, and then every player just has to roll a die.  It's always exciting when the Abbess and Prioress player is taking her turn because you have to reveal your location if you are discovered.

There's a lot to like here. The setting is unique to my knowledge, and the illustrations are a lot of fun. It's like a Hayley Mills movie in board game form.

If people don't overthink it, it's fun. If they do, it can be torture.

Big fun. There are some hurdles: EVERY player needs to know the rules quite well in order to determine if their nuns can be seen or heard, and the line-of-sight rules can be confusing.

A beautiful wedding between rules and theme, the game really captures the feeling of sneaking through the halls and feeling the tension of almost being caught.

My wife and I bought this based on the quirky theme and the description on the back of the box. We are incredibly happy we did! Nuns on the Run is a fun game of hide and seek that's fairly straightforward to play once you understand a few of the fiddly rules. It's definitely better the more people you have to play - 4 seems to be the tipping point at which things start getting really interesting, but the game still serves 2 and 3 players well enough. I would certainly look into house rules or variants for an experience with fewer players, just to make things more interesting.

Overall this was a surprisingly good impulse buy. A fun theme with good artwork and an enjoyable experience overall.

RATING: 7
Cute idea. One player is the big nun at a nunnery, the others are novices who have not yet taken their vows and want to fulfill their secret wish before the night is over. Novices record their moves secretly on a piece of paper. The big nun player actually has two nuns to move around. Mostly they follow a preset path, but can veer if they detect any shenanigans (i.e., hear or see novices out of the bedrooms). Novices choose their speed and destination, and at the end make a sound roll -- the louder they are and the closer to a big nun, the more likely they will be heard. It's also possible for a big nun to turn the corner and see a novice right there. If a nun catches a novice, they get a scolding and are sent marching back to their rooms. If unescorted, they can bolt and go back to their wish-fulfilling. 

Each novice generally has to fetch a key from a random location (which they stole and hid prior in the day) and then travel to the room with their secret wish item (birthday cake, booze, banned book, whatever). If the novices are caught with their item, it is lost and must be re-fetched from its location. A novice that brings the item to their room before the game ends win. Otherwise the big nun player wins after a certain number of turns or novice captures.

It's a neat idea, but a little longer than it should be. Play it with expeditious players, and make sure your big nun player is an animated person who likes to get into character, and you'll have a good time.

Ack! Hide and seek in board game form... has a lot going for it I think, but this takes a surprising amount of "work" to play given the light theme. People are always blindsided by the unexpectedly complex rules

A fun family game that can accommodate many players.  It is a much more pleasant job being the "guards" in NotR then it is being Mr.X in Scotland Yard.  Very little downtime for the "nuns", and not too bad for the "guards".  I predict this will get played a lot in the future.

Update: Still a fun game, but I find that it is extremely difficult for the guards to win.  The only times I have seen the guards come close to winning, it was due to pure dumb luck and could have been easily avoided if the novices were playing more cautiously. At some point I might try giving the guards an extra point of movement and see if that improves things at all.

Reverse take on Scotland Yard.  Players all run around the convent secretly while the nuns try to hunt them down.  It's like players are all Silent Snake (though aren't slitting any nun's throats).

It's really very different from most other game experiences (including the standard hunting games like Scotland Yard/NY Chase/Garibaldi/Fury Of Dracula).

Very enjoyable.  Played once with a group of people at a mini-con.  Though it does seems that some of the novices have a slight advantage from the beginning based on positioning, I did like the overall format of the game, and it makes for a great light hidden-information/secret move game; like Scotland Yard  / NY Chase with the roles reversed.

I really like this game but it is a pain in the ass to teach, and the rulebook sucks which makes it hard to answer questions about vagaries in the rules.  Also, the art designer for the board messed up with putting the guard's colored route lines over top of the doorways; players constantly miss the doors because of it.  Despite all that, I still think this is an awesome game.

With the right crowd, this can be a very fun game. There seems to be a lot of variance in the results--sometimes the guards win early and easily, while other times they barely see anyone at all. For that reason, I'd consider this a light game, but still very fun.

Aptly described as Scotland Yard in reverse. This game fixes some of Scotland Yard's problems while introducing some of its own. For example, while each player's role is more interesting (because everyone is competing), objectives aren't very well balanced. And heavy doses of luck mean that both winners and losers may feel that there's nothing anyone could or should have done differently. That's a problem for me. Though not without its virtues, NotR isn't something I'd request.

It's an ok game, nice concept, but messy and rough around the edges. It just didn't seem to flow for us and there were way too many small issues to want to get this on the table.

Ugg! Neat idea: 1 (or 2) players control the abbess and prioress, while the rest are novices. Each novice has a secret wish: they must first get a key, then get the SW, then sneak back to their room to win. The abbess/prioress win by capturing players enough times, or keeping any player from winning for 15 turns. But the game is ruined for me by:
- the board, which is so busy and dark that it's not easy to see where the walls and doorways are located
- the annoying need to constantly check line of sight during movement
- rolling a die and counting out distances, every single turn!
- once a novice is found, it can be easy to "lose them" and then just catch them again and again!

One play, and I was happy that it ended!

RATING: 3
This game is a kind of reverse-Scotland Yard.  It is the same kind of outguessing/chase game but instead of a few chasing one, it is 2 chasing many.  I wasn't a fan of Scotland Yard so I didn't have high hopes for this one going in.

My one playthrough was with 8 people, the max for this game, which has 2 nuns chasing 6 novices.  If one of the novices gets back to their room with their "secret desire" then they win.  The nuns only win by catching the novices 6 times (equal to the number of novices) before this happens.  With 8 it is nigh-impossible for the nuns to win.  There is only so much ground 2 players can cover on the map while following somewhat stringent movement rules.  No matter what one of these novices is going to have a path that gets them back to the room before the nuns can catch them 6 times.  I can see how the game would be a lot more balanced with fewer players though.

Aside from the imbalance with 8 players, this game has two other big problems.  The first is a set of rules that doesn't always make sense.  A big example of this is that when the novices get a key of a certain color they can use that key to open any locked door on the map, not just the doors matching that color.  If this is the case then why even color-code the keys/locks?

This first problem is compounded by the second which is one of, if not the worst, written rulebook for a game I've ever seen.  In just a single playthrough we came across 2-3 different rules situations that were not explained at all in the book.  Don't get me wrong, I understand rules confusion can happen in games but a.  This is not the most complicated game system and b.  2-3 different rules clarifications needed on the first play tells me that they are common enough occurrences that the rulebook should have explained them.

I will say though that the theme is goofy and fun but the game system is not very well done in my opinion.  I'm not a fan of the set paths the nuns have to follow and the amount of penalty the nuns receive for running at the benefit of moving just one more space than the novices can for example.  And there are several more poorly done elements compared to Scotland Yard which, while I don't particularly enjoy, is at least elegantly crafted.

This game just feels very rushed from the bad design to the skimpy rulebook.

BestWith: 4-8>2,3. Notes per author: You may remain in the 'caught' state even if you are out of site, but you must continue moving your marker on board towards your cell. (Typically until guard returns to path.) You can flip it anytime during your turn when out of sight, but as soon as you get off the path to your room, you have to flip it. Two Player Variant: The younger nun can choose her path at random, but still must stick to the colored routes unless she sees/hears something.

Scotland Yard in reverse. Despite name and theme, i think this works best with gamers as it requires very careful planning and observation. Plus the table of Line of sight is a bit too much for the casual family gamer. Being colour blind i have problem with the 'Patrol routes'. Nicelt produced, Needs minimum of four players and i suspect the more players the better it is.

One player plays nuns trying to capture novices that are sneaking around the abbey.   It is an interesting, if not quirky, stab at an area deduction game.  It is like the opposite of Scotland yards, where here there are many novices and a couple of nuns.  The way the nuns 'here' novices sneaking or running is kind of interesting but the execution of that is poor.  The players have to mentally count spaces to the nun each space the nun moves and it becomes obvious  to the nun they are getting close by the focused concentration on the players faces as they count the spaces.  I'd play it again, but it was not my typical cup of tea.

An somewhat fun game of deductive cat and mouse and except there are 2 cats and a lot of mice scurrying about.  With that being said, I think playing an actual game of hide and seek would be a lot more fun.  For one thing, the players aren't really hidden on the board.  What comes to mind is how Dracula is hidden in Fury of Dracula.

An intriguing twist on Scotland Yard, but unless we were playing it wrong, it seemed way too dependent on luck for my taste.  If your novice's cell ends up being close to where her key is, and the guards don't head in her direction, she can run on every turn and win easily.  The entertainment value of the theme and mechanics only lasted about halfway through the game.  Now after two plays, I would really have to be in a silly mood to play it again.

This is a hide-n-seek type game. You are novices trying to sneak around to procure a secret item. Meanwhile you have to avoid being caught by the abbess.

The dice rolls and comparisons should be an easy mechanic, but are somehow incredibly confusing.

Single play (one of three newbie novices against a nun who had played once). While it felt more fun than Scotland Yard, I couldn't help but feel there were a few too many complexities that should have been smoothed out: doors a bit unclear, line of sight in general, etc. While it felt quite entertaining as a novice, I'm not so sure playing a nun would be as enjoyable - there seems little to base decisions on.

I've learned from playing this game that I despise hidden movement games.  In addition, the rules are just a pain and really hamper what should be a fun game.  All the LOS checks and checking for noises bogs down the game and really sucks the fun out. 

I will not be playing this game ever again.

*****EDIT*****

Alright, so I played it a second time.  You know what?  I didn't hate it.  I didn't love it either.  I was mostly ambivalent.  I still think its far too rulesy for what it is, but I'll play so long as I don't have to the the Abbess/Prioress.  Playing them is just the suck.

I won't ask to play this. I'd probably even try to dissuade the group from playing.  But I'd play it if they insisted.

Heaps of potential, and really captures the theme better than most (I really did feel like I was standing still trying not to make a sound when the Abbess was just round the corner). Some great innovations over something like Scotland Yard too, with the noise and vanish tokens working particularly well. The thing that probably ruins it all for such a light game is the incredible fiddliness and uncertainty working out lines-of-sight. The game can hinge on a millimetre here or there, and that's quite unsatisfying.

A kids game essentially with sneaking and hiding. We misplayed some rules so this possibly deserves a better rating, but it was only okay.

Update: The rules really are a mess. In a game as mechanically simple as this, and with as much luck present, there really shouldn't exist look-up charts for LoS.

2 plays now and both marred by bad rules. With 2 different people teaching, I'm now shifting the blame from the explainer on to the game itself.

A run of bad luck (being nearby when someone else gets seen, and the result being that you get caught, sucks immensely.

Exciting game, most players really get into this very well. You do need a good guard player in order to keep things interesting and the game can sometimes end in an anti climax when someone 'suddenly' wins.

We use a couple of house rules:
- Randomize starting cells after players chose their color. This prevent players from using the same strategy over several games if they always start in the same spot.
- Novices must *start* their turn in their cell with their secret wish in order to win. This prevents a player from running into their cell right in front of one of the nuns' nose.

I have noticed that there is a problem with the game in that there is often one player that, by luck of his path and secret wish, is always out of the way of the nuns and wins the game running. Therefore I am considering adding the house rule to let novices make more noise when they pass a door. I hope this will make the hole the nuns leave a bit smaller. An alternative idea would be to force novices to count noise distance from the closest space they were to the nuns instead of from their end space.

Nuns on the Run is a modern chase game with fresh ideas and a LOT of rules.  It has been reasonably compared to Scotland Yard, but Nuns is much fussier, with a stuttering flow and poor sightline art.  The hunter receives so little actionable information that, even with a full table, it is tough to catch anybody.  Therefore, if you're caught once, you're toast.

This is me and my girlfriends favorite game at the moment. We both love the tension that the game consistently brings even in a 2-player game. However, when the novice nuns win we both have to check each round if they committed errors in regards to line of sight. This requires the guard player to log down his moves each turn as well. An error in the part of the novice nun results in a win for the guards.

First Impression:

An interesting hide and seek game, that creates a lot of laugh and tabletalk.

For a game with hidden information there is a lot to know, and it is possible for players new to the game to give their possition away accidentaly only because they needed a rule clarification. The game also plays a bit slower than I'd like, since we need to constantly check if noises are heard.

Overall it's a unique enjoyable game, but not a gem really.

Nuns on the Run is a very fun and entertaining game that has enough charm to it to win over both casual gamers (who will not be bogged down with mechanics) and veteran gamers( who will see the fun in it, even if it isn't as complex as some of their other games). The nun theme itself is pasted on and the setting could be easily changed without altering game play. However, the real theme is how each role feels to play, and the game captures each mood perfectly. The two roles also play differently and have a very different feel to them. With a play time of an hour or less, this game could easily be a fun filler, but might even work itself into more of a main course with repeated plays.

I dunno. I thought it would be more fun than it ends up being. Line of sight is kind of hard to determine without placing a ruler, which gives your location away (ie - can't do it.) Being caught basically ends the game for you, but you have to keep on playing. No, I don't think I'll play this too much more.

Extremely easy to learn and much more fun than it seems on the surface. This is definitely one of my go-to games for large groups as it allows everyone to take their turns at the same time and avoids boring "waiting for turn" situations.

Needs more than 2 players. Winning is a matter of running when the nuns are chasing somebody else. I'm grateful for the session I played but doubt I'd ever play it again.

I do like that it plays so many people, but the whole blind umpiring doesn't work too well with so many exceptions/borderline cases (the fact that they had to include a chart to say where you can see who where in the courtyard slows the game way down).

The story is great! "Naughty novices dodging discovery", this title never goes unnoticed. The game is a lot of fun to a lot of people, it fits up to 8 players, 2 as the abbess and prioress and 6 novices. The game has a great tension between the players, with nice mechanics. I felt the need of more different blessing cards.

Fréderic Moyersoen presents a new take on the us-versus-them genre with Nuns on the Run, published by Mayfair Games. Most of the players are novices who are eager to secretly explore the grand abbey at night in order to fulfill their "secret wish." They sneak through corridors searching for keys and treasures. (What treasures could a novice be searching for? Forbidden cookies? A soft mattress?) While sneaking through the abbey, they must remain watchful for the abbess or prioress who are on patrol to ensure that pure novices remain that way. These characters are controlled by other players who want to nab the novices before they can make it back into bed.
\13\\13\
Nuns on the Run is a like a reverse of Scotland Yard. Players play either as a novice, or as the Abbess or Prioress. The Novices move in secret and avoid being seen or heard by the Abbess or Prioress. The goal is to make it to the location on the board where the novice can get her "secret wish" and return to their room without being detected. All of the novices move in secret by marking their movement and locations on hidden sheets. The Abbess and Prioress move on regulated paths around the board, but can diverge and chase down novices that they see or hear. The player or players who complete their secret wishes and return to their rooms win, or the Abbess and Prioress win if they catch a certain number of novices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Seemed fairly fiddly and fairly easy for the novices to sneak around without the abbess/prioress being able to catch enough of them to win the game or make it to round 15 without one of them making it back to bed.

RATING: 5
Really quite terrible for 2-3 players. Gets better for 4, but this is a game that only really plays well with a lot of people (which I never have). Overall a disappointment, and probably the last time I buy a game solely on a Tim Vasel review.

RATING: 7
Hilarious reverse of the classic Scotland Yard title. Instead of the cops chasing the bad guy, it's the head nun chasing the sinful younger nuns to their rooms. With the proper crowd this can be the source of a lot of laughs. Rules are a bit clunky at points, especially with the line of sight and sound rules but other than that the game is good fun.

Well, this game is just a lot of fun. It's like Scotland Yard, but in reverse. The components have a lot of comic book appeal. Don't expect a highly strategic game, but DO expect a lot of cursing and oohs and ahs. This one gets the blood flowing for sure!

Great fun! Best new game I played this year. I did have the privilege to play a guard against a full set of 6 novices, so I think you'd need at least 3 novices for this game to be fun. 

Playing novices seems to offer the most excitement, playing the guards offer so much satisfaction when you capture the novices!

Wonderfully hilarious game with an awesome theme.  Some might find it offensive and it is more of an adult game.  It is important that all players are trustworthy and fully understand the rules or the game will drag.

UPDATE: After a play tonight in 2017 I merely find this ok in comparission to other options. I do like the theme but it felt like you don't really control things as much as you would like and a few rules questions made it less desireable for the group especially with the amount of time it took to finish. Now I rate it a 5 down from 7.

I admit, this is the only hidden movement (not counting 2 player only games) game I have, but I love it. It is one versus many mixed with hide and seek. Most people have the hidden movement and have destination 1, destination 2 and to get back to their room. The one is the "guards" who has to catch them # of times = to the player count. I love it and the theme is fairly unique

interesting concept, and very nice execution with good theme.  the mechanics of girls sneaking about the convent is done very well, and is not too hard to keep up with.  it's easy to imagine yourself a catholic girl in a convent, trying desperately to get away with sneaking about the halls, when the nasty prioress comes around the corner.  works well with larger groups of people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The rules are really badly organized and the game depends heavily on not-very-clear mechanics of notifying each other when things are heard or seen.  Some variants listed here offer to simplify it, and I'll definitely try those next time.  The theme gets everyone giggling, but then the game is far too silent.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice change up on the hidden movement genre where there is one seeker and a bunch of hidden players.  It is fun to play as a novice and try to sneak around the Mothers... but playing the seeker seems pretty frustrating as you are really at the mercy of your die rolls and can't follow your hunches as you need to follow certain paths while seeking.

My mom who is totaly catholic when off on us when we were playing this and making fun of the nuns.  It was fun as hell but more because we were just slaming the two nun pieces in this game.  Total hilar! I will re rate this when I actually get a real game in.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Have only played as the nuns so far since I've been teaching the game.  Essentially acting as a moderator to move the game along since the burden is mostly on the novices to check whether they are seen or heard during every turn.  Hard to gauge the tension level due to the fact that these are reactionary roles.  I don't actually perform any interesting action unless someone makes a mistake (figuratively, as in failing noise check).  So all I can do is to cover as much ground as possible with the routes I pick and try to be smart about the locations I should visit.

The biggest downside is that a game could end quickly and uneventfully if people are rolling the die well.  The fun factor is very dependent on people getting close calls or unintentionally caught because of someone else.  Even so, I think it has the potential to be a crowd pleaser and being able to accommodate a large group is definitely a plus.

RATING: 5
I think this game is fun, but not something I would highly recommend.

The components are nice as expected from Mayfair Games, but box insert doesn't allow the lid to fully close due the thick board.  This is a little frustrating and unfortunate.

The game play can be fun with the right group, but AP can really ruin it.  I find sessions to be a little on the long side for what it is which definitely affects my impressions.

I think the theme is unique and not something you see very often.  It certainly feels tacked on in every regard.

Mechanics fit the theme well.  Dice suck.  

Scales badly--our 4p game was weighted heavily against the abbess-player.  In an 8p game, the abbess would be tripping over nuns.  Not good.

Suspenseful, sillier, more complex take on the [thing=438][/thing] notion of folks sneaking around without getting caught.  Still, there are some nice aspects to this, and it feels thematically rich, although with a surprisingly large influence from wargames.

A reverse Scotland Yard, and very well done. I really like this game, as it's tense and the die rolls are fun. Not much more to say, there are some questions that always pop up on how and where the young nuns disappear, but the rules are well written and it's not hard to follow.

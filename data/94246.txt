GAME: 1812: The Invasion of Canada
RANK: 619
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Why this game works:
-The theme is about a war that almost seems relevant.
-5-player war games are more fun than 2-player war games.
-2-sided war games don't have all the problems of many-sided war games: turtling, kingmaking, pawning, picking on the runt, lame alliances, etc...
-Also, since it's 2-sided, every player is invested in every move, every decision, and every roll of the dice.
-The prevalence of multi-factional armies keep everyone *even more* invested than they would be otherwise and means that there is almost no downtime.
-It's super easy to learn and the game play is smooth as a baby's bottom.
-Lots of units start on the board for immediate action, but there is some variance to the set-up for variety of play.
-Not knowing when the game is going to end keeps everyone on the edge of their seat the whole time.
-A lot of battles come down to 1 or 2 very important die rolls. That's just a recipe for fun, excitement, and surprise.
-Making jokes about conquering Montreal is pretty fun.

As long as players don't haggle over every single command decision you'll have a good time...

Fantastic. Low rules overhead, blazing-fast gameplay, tough decisions. Plus, lots of dice, and lots of fun! 

UPDATE: At 2p, there doesn't seem to be a lot of "there" there. I might be more engaged with the 1775 subject matter, but likely the game system just isn't for me.

RATING: 9.5
Rating based on two plays with 3 players. Note: this is based on my opinion of what's important in a game. I'm also trying to rate this versus what the game tries to be, not versus other more or less complex games.

Description: Introductory level game of the War of 1812.

Components [9/10] - Overall, excellent. Cards are well done, dice are attractive and functional, wood cubes are perfectly functional for the game, control markers are easy to distinguish and attractive.  Mounted map quality is excellent and fully functional for the game.  A player aid sheet would have been a nice addition though and the only reason for losing a point here.

Cost [9/10] - Reasonable price for what you get.

History/Theme [8/10] - Doesn't make any provision for following true history during the course of the game.  But, for an intro-level game, it does have several mechanisms for giving a nice flavor of the period.  For example, the event cards give special actions based on actual events that are described on the bottom of the cards.  Also, the dice are designed to portray how different troops fought in the war - i.e. the British troops will not flee, the colonial militia don't hit as well as the regulars, etc.  Also, the Indians have a special rule which allows them to effectively sneak beyond American lines and cause havoc.  Finally, the rulebook includes 3 1/2 pages of history on the War of 1812.  A really nice addition!

Strategy [9/10] - Good amount of strategy for an intro level game.  Battles can be a little too dependent on die rolls vs good strategy, but that effects both sides and adds to the fun of the game.

Fun Factor [10/10] - Enjoyable relatively light game.

Replayability [10/10] - Likely a different experience every time.

Length [10/10] - Around 1 - 1 1/2 hours depending on how the game goes, which seems perfect.

Rules [10/10] - Short rules (~5 pages). Very well written.

Intangibles [20/20] - Excellent introductory game on the War of 1812. Very streamlined play through the use of the innovative dice and the movement/event cards.  Not dripping in history but not designed to.  I look at this as more of a game whose purpose is to get people interested in learning more about the history of the period while having a great time.  There are some very good games to delve more into the history of the period, like Amateurs To Arms and Mr. Madison's War, but this game seems to fit a niche at the intro level and fit it perfectly.

Overall: [95/100] = 95.0%

I like it. It's a bit luck-based, but it's still fun. My friends aren't as much of a fan, but I guess they don't like the genre. It's light and it ends, unlike say... Risk. The fleeing is kind of funny.

RATING: 7
Very light game, but it packs a lot of fun. Initially, I was worried that the cubes would make a Euro, but it is not. The cubes give it a slick way to make it into a 2-5 player game. This is all about punching the other guy in the mouth and taking his land."

Sure you need to change a pair of things (4 cards for the US and another die for the blue). Then it becomes a must.

This game was pretty random, but I had fun.  I don't know that the other factions would have been fun to play, but I felt very sneaky playing the native americans.  The game ended up being very close, and I liked the way it came down to the wire.

I think the game would not have been as fun playing 2 player as it was 5, but I'm not certain.

RATING: 7.3
:cry: :D :D :D :D Play the 1813 scenario, it is shorter and more balanced than the base game, which heavily favors Canada. 

Still, its sequel 1775 Rebellion is vastly superior. 1812 is likely best played with a very strong player in the USA and a moderate one in Canada.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very good Card-Driven-like wargame. It's not exactly Card Driven as most movement cards and special cards does not change the dynamics on the map but provides a limitation to a Axis and Allies type of wargame. Dice still rules the game system. Cubes decide on the RISK like decision on dice to be thrown. 

A mixture of RISK and Axis/Allies with cubes to give flavour of a Euro-type gaming feeling. 

Overall, a light and fast game makes this a very good introduction game to beginners in wargames.

A fun and fast multiplayer wargame, played in 2 teams.
Really light. It almost feels like a filler. Luck-driven, but not excessively.
The only thing I disliked about the mechanics is the web and flow aspect of the offensives. It's really hard for one of the sides to put resources in a specific offensive action and sustain it once the troops are into enemy territory. 
So, the momentum comes and goes like a pendulum until the last few rounds. It gave me and my group the impression that the games gets decided by what the players do on the last couple of rounds.

A fun, light boardgame that has a good sprinkling of luck and touch decisionmaking.  It somehow manages to be more than the sum of its parts, and also is short enough not to overstay its welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Yes, it's on the lighter side, and not much strategy here, but it's easy and quick to play, the cards provide just enough variation from game to game to make you adjust your tactics, and of course there's the joy of laughing derisively when your opponent's troops run away. (Tip: never underestimate the importance of going first in a battle.) 

Have only played 2-player, not sure if there's enough here for 4 or 5 players. Also, it's hard to hold a position in enemy territory since it's fairly easy for the enemy to bring lots of troops to bear upon whatever's left of your successful attacking force. Games are normally won by the player who goes last, and they're won by a margin of only 1 or 2 VPs. So after a lot of back and forth and plenty of attacks, not much gets accomplished, and this might turn off some players. Feels like a 10-round boxing match ending in a 95-94 decision.

Initial Impressions: I hate to say it but I'm not a big fan of this game. The conflict certainly interests me but I find the game too swingy. Variable turn order can result in one side having too many unanswered actions and not giving the other side a fighting chance. Although the dice mechanism is innovative and simplifies the combat system, the cards are what bothers me the most about the game. The randomness of the cards can end the game before it's really begun. This fills the 5player light Risk-like wargame itch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 8
Solid wargame/euro hybrid that scales well between 2 - 5 and has very little rules overhead.  Top notch production, from pieces to board to rules.  There is a ton of luck in the system, from card draw to dice, but the game is short enough for me that it isn't a problem.  This would be a great intro to wargames for families and kids from age 8 or 9 up.

Also, new players can just drop in and take control of a faction - something very few games can do.

Thinking of upping my rating to a 9

Having played in solo, and with a group, I think that this is a wonderful game, despite my concerns with certain aspects, which I mention below.  I think the game has nuance and depth, with plenty of style and class.  I would not consider it a pure "wargame," but it is a fine strategy game.

-------------------------------------------------------

My initial impressions are not positive concerning the rules.  There are too many gaps and unanswered questions, and given the absolute slew of playtesters, one would think questions would have been raised and gaps filled.  We shall see.  The board is among the best layouts, and looks like it would work well with a block game.  Perhaps a set of blocks could be used from another game?  Cubes are simple, cheap, generic and, mostly cheap.  Why add a cheap looking component to such a nice board?  

_____________________________________


Jeph, has been most helpful and patient in answering my questions, for which I am grateful.  The cards are of heavy stock, and, the more I play the game, their use is critical, to say the least.  The lack of cards--meaning the small deck--and the brevity of the game, is a plus and a minus.  I would like to see longer-game options.  The "buckets of dice"--that is, if you have a large number of cubes to stand in for an army--system has never been a winner with me.  However, I am in a minority in this area.

__________________________________________


I must admit that I think the reviews are filled with more than the usual amount of hyperbolic praise.  It is to the point where I begin to get ill.  We need a review from someone who likes the game, but who has not lost his  or her common sense, or the mind either.

RATING: 8.5
A two-sided war-game that likes to be played a lot like Axis and Allies - that is with all five factions being run by individual players. Fewer numbers can play but it entails deciding on what factions to "double-up" and running multiple factions while quite do-able is a bit fiddly. A lot shorter to play than A&A and a lot of fun to boot.

Also like Axis and Allies, it is an area movement and key area control game. Instead of figs you have colored blocks that represent troops. Plus, you are rolling a lot of dice, in this case unique dice rather than traditional six-sided numbered dice. In fact, the combat system is a variation on buckets of dice which is the "hook" to this game and is quite cleverly done. Cards regulate movement (including an abstracted version of movement along or across water) and also represent a clock of sorts in another interesting twist on the use of cards to support game play.

A "beer and pretzels" approach to representing the series of skirmishes which summed up the conflict; and one which, to all intents and purposes, ended up in a draw (well, except for the native Americans who were bound to lose either way).

Bottom line: light multi-player war-game that plays through quickly while providing a decent fun factor. The theme is relatively well preserved despite the highly abstracted nature of most of it. Overall I'm quite impressed and we're having fun right now with it. I do wonder about its staying power however. I'm thinking medium filler...

Quick Update: Several playings in and we're not tiring of it yet at all. Surprisingly well balanced and the games can often end in a tie (as did the original conflict). Proving to be a keeper!

The way I like to play wargames now! Not too heavy, so the boys can play, and not too long where it consumes too much of a day to complete. Action is encouraged with special cards providing opportunities to engage the enemy on the long front. Dice are weighted for individual army groups to reflect experience and organization. Well thought out and balanced. UPDATE: Played 1775 twice, the newer rendition of this game design. I think I still prefer 1812, as it appears to be more balanced.

One of the best games I have ever played.  It is a Euro-wargame that is deeper and probably has a better feel for the historical than most true wargames.  The components are top notch, the quality is great, I applaud Uwe and Academy Games on everything about this game.  Get your hands and this if you want a fun, fast, wargame trapped in a Europeans clothes.  

The historical aspects are built into the components and cards, not in layer after layer of rules.  For instance, each army rolls a certain colored die, the British roll red dice which have two hits and the option to retreat for them.  The British militia have 1 hit per die, two forced retreats for them, and 3 options to retreat.  With this simple mechanic he has shown the historical propensity for British regulars to stay and fight (or retreat at their discretion) while you will find your British militia running a good deal of the time.  Subtle, simple, effective, and historically accurate.  

Get this game-play this game, you will not regret it.  My only regret is that we didn't get to publish this one.  

Happy Gaming,

Terrific lite war game.  Very collaborative, with ebbs and flows, fear and elation, and a puzzle that is not solved even after a few plays.  Rating may even rise.  Really enjoy this one.  

I will only play with two or five, however.  The discussion and interpersonal connections are a big part of the draw for multiplayer, so you need the full complement.  The puzzling strategy is enough to satisfy in a two-player contest.

I rather like this, but man, I wish it were a bit shorter. At 1 hr it would be great. At 2 hrs it OK. Endgame isn't great. It's also a bit too thin for 5 players unless things really move, but playing more than one faction is a little awkward. There just isn't really enough depth to the game to engage 5 minds, but it plays less cleanly with fewer. Still, it does have fun flavor and it does move reasonably well. Not sure where this will ultimately end up. Not great, but maybe solidly filling a niche.
---
I rather enjoyed this, but it's not a general-audience kind of game. It needs to be played like Risk, aggressively and at a good pace. If you play it at the pace of an equivalent euro, I think it'll take too long and feel drawn out. It certainly could be systemically a touch little tighter, but it's got some great historical flavor and two very interestingly asymmetric sides; really high marks for the latter particularly. Probably wants 5 like-minded players. I don't want to overstate the hazards, but this is probably a wargamers game even though it looks a lot like a euro.

RATING: 8
Easy to learn game system, should be able to entice non-wargamers to play. Nicely done artwork on the map and cards. Not really a simulation but does teach the geography of the area and about notable events and persons. Militia more likely to flee during battle than regulars.

RATING: 6
A very beer and pretzels level game of conflict, despite what the seriousness of the box looks like!  If you're at all intimidated by war games, don't be intimidated here.  The rules are super simple!  The game also offers some pretty unique 3 vs. 2 game play (not sure I'd ever play with anything other than 5 players).

Now, just because it's simple doesn't mean there aren't good decisions to be made.  You can't just half ass run into battles without good positioning and planning.  However, the cards you draw and the rolls of the dice always have a chance of royally screwing up those plans!

Each turn, you'll play a movement card from your hand dictating how many armies you can move, and how far.  Move them, and then if there are any spaces containing opposing forces, roll some dice back and forth until only one force remains.

The combat results can actually be pretty hilarious, as the dice contain a flee icon on one or more sides (each army in the game has a slightly different ration of symbols on their dice).  A rolled flee icon means your guy runs off into the wilderness, and will return to a spawn point on your next turn.  So, you might be kicking ass in a battle, and some of your guys keep running away!  Some people might find it frustrating, but I was entertained.

There's a variable game end, and when it hits, you want to have the most forts secured on the opposing side of the board.  Simple as that!

Overall, not a game that blew my mind, but fun enough for a simple 5 player experience if you like conflict games without the huge wargame rule books.

The end mechanism is very interesting. The war will end, you try to be ahead when the music stops.

Easy to learn, and I really like the game but its pretty light. A lot of back and forth movement which is fun. But the last turn initiative draw just killed the game for me. Seems like a lot of work to be so dependent on getting the init that last turn.

RATING: 6.25
Fun, light, strategic wargame that is easy for non-wargamers to grasp.  Love the asymmetry of the forces, particularly in the differences between their battle dice.

While the game is simple, there are a wealth of strategic options.  I find many clever plays are made each time we sit down to play and the back and forth is very engaging.

However, there is also a bit of worry that the two sides are unbalanced, with the Americans having a decidedly hard time at winning.  This has been backed up statistically with the win thread I created to track wins by nationality.

Lighter than I expected, 1812 is definitely more Euro than wargame, but the unique decks, cards and the map make it much more thematic than your typical Euro.

RATING: 7
Dice rolling is not my interest but, in this game the dice accurately depict the unreliability of militia and the professionalism of the regulars.

Clearly, a lot of play testing went into this design and it shows in a very playable, historical themed, yet ultimately light and accessible dice rolling game.  The luckiest dice rollers will win but tactics can slightly aid.  I estimate that skill can swing the game 15% either way from straight dice probabilities.

Think Small World with straight dice combat.

I've realized that I'm a fan of "dudes on a map" games, though I'm not exactly the biggest Ameritrash fan, and I have played hardly any true wargames. 1812 caught my attention after reading a list about "Best Wargames of 2012," but I saw the reasonable playing time and multiple players. That got me reading more.

After one play running the Canadians, I can say I really like this game. I'm not very good at spatial maneuvering in wargames, but I really enjoyed weighing different options with this game. The arrangement of territories and the possibility of water movement means that each turn provides a few key considerations, and I suspect coordination between team members will win out. This is not cube shuffling between spaces in El Grande; this is movement that really matters.

Is it balanced? Heck... I dunno! One play ain't gonna tell me that. But our game was a blowout in the first two turns, but ended up more of a squeaker by the end of round 3. I'm excited to try this again. 

Update: traded this away for Seasons and an expansion. Don't get me wrong, I love this game system, but I just felt that I only needed one of the games between this and 1775.

I am interested to see how this game plays as the history of the War of 1812 in the US is so often skewed. Neglecting the fact that it was primarily a struggle between Native and Anglo Americans over control of the Midwestern United States with little-to-no British involvement.  I was shocked to learn it ignores the naval war on the Great Lakes.

As always, it will be interesting to see where it the rating settles once it regresses to the mean.

This is an enjoyable, light wargame.  Movement in the game is card-driven, such cards being randomly drawn.  Battles are resolved with dice.  There are variable powers among the different army types (regular vs. militia, and the Native Americans have some interesting abilities).  The game has a satisfying balance of depth versus length-of-play, and it can be taught quickly and understood by new, or younger gamers.   Surprisingly, in my opinion, it plays better as a multiplayer game than as a two-player, due to the collusion and strategizing, which become a big part of the fun with 4 or 5 players.

Solid all round war game, that somehow manages to be more than what it seems at first. 1812 plays relatively quickly, keeping all players engaged. It makes good use of a mix of mechanics, using a light rule system. The custom dice reflecting each of the different factions relative strengths and weaknesses. 1812 leaves you with lots of options and tough decisions, looking forward to my next play.

Although not a classic wargame, ignore naysayers who call this light.
The friction of command is hidden in the 
movement of the factions; where decisions are made
of how to move groups together, how to use 'command'
combat results to move to other areas, and which faction takes a hit and
the discussions between commanders of the factions.
This is the future of fast wargaming.
Been waiting decades for this. I dislike large card hands, so 3 cards in your hand out of 12 total
make for a smooth game.

Excellent little strategic wargame, that appeals beyond the historical audience in my experience.  Each players only has 12 cards, two or three custom dice and a stack of cubes; but these coalesce into an excellent tactical puzzle, with a chunk of diplomacy and negotiation thrown in to boot if you have 5 players involved.  Easy to learn, quick to play.

En 1804, Lewis&Clark pactisaient avec les indiens en toute cordialité. Mais 6 ans plus tard, un peu plus au nord, un terrible conflit eu lieu entre les Anglais et les Américains pour la suprématie du Canada, chacun faisant appel aux tribus indiennes. C'est la seconde guerre d'indépendance. Fini la cordialité, place au scalps et aux batailles. 1812 vous propose de revivre quelques célèbres batailles dans la région des grands lac. Déplacez vos unités de cubes de soldats ou d'indiens, prenez le contrôle des territoires et ne laissez aucun répis à votre adversaire. Un jeu d'affrontement avec des règles simples, à un contre un, ou par équipe.

This quick-playing game of the War of 1812 has a lot going for it: an accessible rule set, agonizing tactical decisions, an evocative historical feel, high re-play-ability, strategic dice battles, and it comfortably supports 2-5 players.  

This would be a great game for Euro-gamers who'd like to dip their toes into the historical wargaming waters or Risk fans who want a meatier, more complex strategy game, but don't want to spend hours putting stickers on blocks or learn 30 pages of rules. You can set up and learn this game in 30 minutes and play your first game in under 2 hours. You'll probably want to play your second game immediately afterward. 

Full Disclosure: I am a friend of the designers. I've play-tested this game from it's very early inception eight years ago and have seen it evolve and develop into the wonderful, gorgeously-produced game you see now. Naturally, I want to see Jeph and Beau knock it out of the park with this game, but I truly believe 1812: The Invasion of Canada could find a comfortable, welcome home in every gamer's collection.

RATING: 6
The War of 1812 is a sort of fast playing euro/wargame hybrid. There are 5 sides, 3 Brits and 2 Americans, each with their own set of colored cubes. As each color is activated (randomly drawn from a bag) they muster and move and maybe play a special card, too. Then you roll the appropriate dice (2 or 3 max, depending on the color), which results in a hit, a retreat or a command decision (retreat or stay).

It's not a particularly deep game, but it does offer some interesting choices occasionally and the movement and event cards, along with the variable timing of the Truce, can result in some interesting variety. In theory you could play this game with up to 5 players, but I really don't see that adding much to the game play.

So, a game I would play from time to time if someone else suggests it, but not something I'm eager to play. At least it's better than that old, dry Columbia block game.

RATING: 7.75
This a Euro-style war game, because the rules are streamlined and balanced.  At the same time, the designers have gone through great lengths to learn about the history of the time, which comes out in its strong theme.  So perhaps this is an Ameritrash style Euro game with a historic theme.  Or maybe it is a war game with Euro style rules...  How ever you describe it, it is definitely a cross over game which takes some of the best elements from several different genres.  The two sides are asymmetric, but seemingly well balanced (I haven't played it enough to know for sure).

I'm pretty sure I've played the final version, though there may have been some minor tweaks since my last game.  It was already a great game when I first played it 5 years ago, but it has gone through a major transformation since then to make it simpler.   Now I'm starting to salivate over it because of the graphics.  Academy Games has done a spectacular job with it!  A game like this becomes more fun with great components because the theme really comes to life.  So I just pre-ordered 2 copies.

Disclaimer:  I know the designers of this game, but I am not ashamed to give it a 9, because I am so damn excited about getting a copy.  The artist did an amazing job with the paintings, and the game was already great fun to begin with.

Wow, what a great game!

Elegant, fun, fast, engaging, exciting and tense. When I read the rules and looked at the map and components (which are great) I wasn't really too impressed but as soon as I did a solo run-through I was hooked.

Played it the next day with 3 and then 4 players - played it ALL day (6 games). Everyone loved it. When I bought it - I thought it was a 2 player game! Works well from solo to 4 players and likely 5.

Read the reviews then go out and buy this gem. Can't wait for other games using the same system.

Edit October 2012: Still a gem. Easy to teach, fun to play, tough to master. Plays well with 2-5 players.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) I have long been searching for a historical wargame that is easy and fast-playing without losing the historical richness of its theme, and I think I've found it. I'm very interested in the War of 1812 and, despite being very simple in terms of mechanics, this game captures the essence of the war brilliantly. There is a lot of randomness, with the variable turn order in particular heavily affecting how things unfold, but the spirit of the game is light enough for this not to be a sticking point, and the dice rolls result in some great, nail-biting battles and heroic last stands. 

So far have only played this with my dad. He rarely plays games, as he feels he doesn't have the time, but he not only picked up the rules to this relatively painlessly, but has already twice asked to play this again. That is simply unbeatable for me, and if we keep playing it, I imagine my rating will only go up.

Would like to try this out with more than two players, but the theme and confrontational nature might make it not as appealing to my other semi-gaming relatives.

A great family-style multi-player wargame that features the relatively unique theme of Canadian troops (among others) that can fight on Canadian soil.  The rules can probably be taught in 10 minutes and the game plays in 60-90 minutes.  There are 5 armies featured (Indians, Canadians, British regulars, American militia, and American regulars) and each one plays a little differently as they each have their own set of different dice and cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I historically haven't been into area control games, but I LOVE this game.  The rules only take a few minutes to teach, and the game mechanics are simple, yet even within the simple mechanics, the rules are deep and there is a surprising amount of historical thematic flavour.  The game is very much a wargame / euro hybrid - the rules are elegant enough for a eurogamer to feel at home, but it is still enough of a wargame to keep the wargamer's interest.

Also, the components are fantastic.

As of first play I like it. We played a five player game and we were all learning. I did play a solo game against myself so I had some idea how to play so I could teach the others. Although the rules are so simple it's easy to pickup after a turn or two. 

Update: This always goes over well. The dynamics of a 5 player game is pretty interesting. The game lulls new players into thinking it's about taking and holding opponents area. It's not; the mechanics favors the homeland player regardless if you have control at the time or not. This makes it really hard to hold anything for more than a round or two. It's more of a tug of war push pull.

This one was a big surprise to me.  Upon first blush it looks like a thinly themed light area control game. After exploring the game play, I was really wowed.  There is enough historical flavor here from the card events and the historical areas to keep this on the rails.  Beautiful production.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In the end, this is a beautiful-looking game. It is great as a light dice wargame, with a smart thematic theme and well constructed rules. But I walk away feeling like I want something more out of a game like this. Less reliance on luck and more opportunities for experimentation. Obviously, such things would puff up the rule book and take away something very key to this game: simplicity and straightforwardness. But I have so many games like that and these games don't pretend to be bigger than they are (which I think 1812 does).

This is an interesting puzzle.  It's a good mix of light wargaming with a combat system that rewards mixed armies of regulars and militia and also makes regulars clearly superior troops.  Indians also have unique advantages.

I really need to try this again.

After 3 plays, this game strikes me as well-designed and so much fun to play.  The endgame condition with the truce cards is tricky.  Play it too soon in the round and the opposition will have a chance to swing the score in a huge way.

Two players is the best way to play this, but it's quite fun with five as well.  There appear to be an endless number of ways to approach the game, and the dice keep it interesting even in seemingly hopeless battles.  Using the Command Decision to withdraw at the right moments can be critical to victory.  This is up to a perfect 10 rating for me.  

Once one side falls behind by more than three or four objectives, it forces them to open up offensively and go on the attack.  What a great game.  Just played my highest scoring game, with the British side narrowly winning 10-9.

Risk as it should be - only 2 sides (players are on teams if more than 2) which eliminates the king making, limited turns, achievable victory condition, neat card driven movement, and combat mechanics that very cleverly incorporate National Characteristics without any complications, and a board that fits all the bits - great. Components are excellent although I guess that nice model soldiers would have been ideal. Very good.

Our only negative is that the static set-up limits replayability.

I want to like this game more, but it's all driven by the "initiative" roll which is just given to whomever's territory the battle happens in.  Bugs the shit out of me, it's like a HEAVY balance mechanism.  The game is automatically going to be close.

I had the fortunate opportunity to demo this at GenCon 2011. When it was released, I got it at Origins 2012. As an old school wargamer, I was a little skeptical...no hexes. But it was very simple, well crafted, interesting play  mechanics. This is a wargame where hexes and cardboard counters are not needed to convey a strategic campaign.

It's a very light wargame, but it has problems.
1) it isn't about the War of 1812, but about some cube war
2) the luck isn't just in the dice, but also the cards (which is fine), and also the selection of turn order. If the end of the game wasn't prone to the kind of "free play" that I saw it would be much better.
3) it can be long for what it is.
The game was fun, and not a waste of time, but I'm not sure I'd want to play it again. It took about half the time as Mr. Madison's War: The Incredible War of 1812, but was just wrong for the war. Too abstract.

RATING: 8
A really interesting, hybrid Euro/wargame for five players. It probably works just as well with fewer players as well. 

The conflict is divided between two sides: one with two factions, the other with three. Each faction has unique qualities that makes them play differently, but they still must work together to succeed as a team. 

Several interesting design ideas make me eager to try this one again.

This is a great game for five players, without taking any extra time for the higher player counts.  On top of that, it provides a nice historical background.  A sort of gateway game to the wargame genre.

RATING: 7
The give and take (or capture and recapture) provides a strategic feel that I believe provides players with a sense of how the war actually went... various thrusts and parries that often end up inconclusive. What most other commentators don't mention is the resource allocation dimension of game decisions: which sectors to deploy forces and whether to use offensively, defensively or redeploy.

It does have a bit of last turn / game ending distortion, such as happens in other games where player(s) can make moves that would be unlikely and/or unsustainable, knowing that there will be no counter attack, etc. Need to play more to see how much that detracts from the game. In this game there may be some basis for this in the context of how the actual war end negotiations were conducted while the fighting continued. In future games using the system a different ending may be more appropriate.

Other than that this game is beautifully designed. It's is simple, elegant, is quick, has great components, a good theme & is one of the very few games where 2-5 players can play in teams against each other.

But the random turnorder, especially in the last round will have a huge impact on the outcome. Aswell as simple lucky dice rolls.

I don't mind dice, but only to a certain degree, and here i wish dice rolling had less impact, because other than the initative there is no other way to influence the roll.

I've played the game four times now and I am really fond of it. Once a full 5 player game, twice with 2 players, once with 3 players. All excellent. I've played as the American faction three times now and I'm really beginning to learn how to play them. I've so far been successful with the British once -- I think they are the easier side to play. 

I'm also learning the overall flow and power of the cards. This is a fantastic game full of depth, yet very clean and easy to learn. I love that I can focus on mastering the game, not stumbling through the rules.

Highly recommended.

A Risk for the modern age.  Interesting card play and dice-based combat.  Doesn't overstay its welcome.  The gameplay feel a bit scripted as the Americans try to gather enough troops to break through the British bottlenecks while the British armies pressure weak points of the front lines and play a more defensive game.  Its successor, 1775, is slightly better in this regards.

The team play is one thing that transforms this game from a boring wargame (I don't like wargames, sue me) to something very entertaining.  The two sides are relatively symmetrical but within each side there are multiple factions which are very different.  If you are in control of the Native Americans you will want to do things very differently to someone who is in charge of the redcoats but since you are on a team you can contribute advice and opinion to the player in charge of the redcoats so you feel involved on every turn.

The irregular turn order (factions act based on their token being drawn from a bag) means that one year (turn) the blue forces might get all their actions at the start of the year and make big strides only to see some or all of them be beaten back when the reds get to take three goes in a row later.

The tactical considerations of where to put the different troops, which ones to lose to combat and when to make tactical retreats are actually surprisingly deep.  My thoughts about what the best tactics are develop almost every time I play.

The historical appeal comes through special action cards which are simple enough not to be confusing or tiresome but interesting enough to energize the game and throw in a little bit of historical information.  Napoleon has been defeated.  Two more units of redcoats are freed up to fight in the new world.  Looks like taking Montreal might not be as easy as you thought yankee.

The game can either go the full distance (I think 10 turns) or end when one side has played all their truce cards.  In general games I've played have ended early when someone who thought they were in a winning position called a truce, however the game doesn't end until the final phase of that turn and quite often the board positions get reversed and the team that called the truce ends up losing.

Production value is beautiful, and I like the way the design tries to effortlessly incorporate some historical detail in little ways like the customized dice.  Still, the war does not feel quite right without any real reflection of the difficulties of supply.  Yes, casualties are higher when you are on the other side of the map, but honestly, without supply lines lots of quirky things can happen in this game.  I also think ingnorning the importance of the war on the lakes was a mistake.

RATING: 8
Borrows a number of core mechanisms from Risk, but adds enough to make it a unique game of its own. 

The team element and random turn order encourage a lot of dialogue, the interplay between the cards and game end conditions tighten up the game length and keep everyone involved (classic Risk seemed to go on interminably, especially if you were knocked out early) and the subtle yet significant distinctions between the factions add colour.

Feels like the British team has an advantage with inexperienced players due to their starting positions on the border, but I suspect all it means is that the US needs to spend a little time recruiting and consolidating before going over to the attack.

1812 is a quick, light, enjoyable multiplayer wargame, something of a rarity. I enjoy the accessibility and brevity of the game. It plays best when played quickly, not getting bogged down in analysis or overly long planning. The constantly shifting turn order is a great feature, as well as the asymmetrical dice and decks. This is a big hit, and I would own it if I had played it prior to the release of 1754, which improves on this system.

RATING: 7
Brilliantly re-worked version of Risk that uses the battleground areas in Canada and the US, with five different armies allowing 2-5 plays (less players means more armies for some players) and a set number of turns. If you like history or are looking for a different type of war game, then this is definitely the game for you.

BIG PLUS: the dice can send soldiers fleeing back to base, making an overwhelming army less predictable.
BIG MINUS: the game is imbalanced in favour of the British (yay!); if the US need reinforcements, they come too late.

The game is broken. Very unbalanced in favor of the British. The British player can't lose, period. Basically its 3 British versus only 2 Americans. the Indians give them too many advantages, up to 3 extra dice in battle and they have the ability to to enormous damage to the rear areas thanks to their special cards and re-deployment rules.  Will only play if i can take the British side and even then when I feel like clubbing baby seals for an easy win.

Rated a 7 after one play of the intro scenario with two people. I have since played a 5 player game and it was a very different beast. Loads of table talk and very cool dynamics between allied players. I liked that a lot! I need to play some more and may bump this to 8 if it remains as fun and engaging as that game was. More players seems better so far.


It's a light wargame with many Euro design elements. I like the theme, components, and several of the mechanics. The only thing that bothers me is the die rolling. It's not a deal breaker, but it does detract from the otherwise very streamlined strategic experience. 

The randomness of the deck is mitigated nicely with a 3-card hand. The randomness of Battle is not as easily reined in. However, they did make efforts to provide a novel Battle experience. If you don't land hits then your troops will either flee (you get to place them back on the board at the beginning of that faction's turn) or they have an optional retreat to a neighboring area. So if you don't hit you still have some tactical decisions to make which I appreciate. In the end you can still roll shit and the game can swing at the mercy of the dice which I don't like much.

To its credit the game is not very long and has tons of interesting tactical decisions. Hand management and the distribution of troops of each faction are very important. The latter influences troop movement, if you have a British movement card then you must move armies that contain at least one British troop, therefore spreading out your British troops becomes important. This is countered by wanting more troops of a type in the same army so that you can roll all of that faction's dice. There are many clever trade offs and points of decision like this in the game and for the play time the randomness does not overwhelm the awesomeness of the rest of the game.

Some interesting mechanics married to a very powerful catch up mechanism which allows a player to always fire first in his home territory.  Good strategy seems heavily dependent on getting a good turn sequence, a minor advantage in victory points and then manipulating the cards to produce a rapid truce.  Because the British alliance has more activations (& dice to fire with), it feels like they have too great an advantage in both  maneuver and combat (whether true or not everyone I've played it with seems to arrive at this conclusion and that keeps it off the table).

This game is a winner. I picked it up, almost on a whim, and it exceeded my expectations. This isn't a game for the ages, but it's a solid and easy to learn wargame with broad appeal. 

I'm not a wargamer, even though I like interactive strategy games. This is one of the few wargames in my collection. It's easy to teach, plays in about an hour, and has a semi-cooperative element. It seems to work with many different people, including players who would never want to play a wargame. There is some luck, but on closer inspection I think the game has more strategy, and less luck, than one might think on the first play. The combat system is excellent. The only quibble here is the British seem slightly overpowered in our experience, and this matches reports on the BGG forums. 

After a few plays this rates a strong 7 for me. Given enough plays this could be an 8, though I suspect that 1775: Rebellion, the followup game in this series, will be the one that earns the higher grade.

A very nice, asymmetric team-based, light wargame.  I like it quite a bit, but it may be a little too long for what it is, and its main downside is that some factions are a lot more fun and interesting to play than others.  The Native Americans, for instance, are a real blast, while getting stuck with the Canadian Militia kinda sucks.

Still, though, having unique dice for each faction is a really great way to bring in their particular strengths and weaknesses without adding in a lot of unneeded rules complexity into gameplay.

RATING: 8
First, I am not a fan of historical war game, and that will be the reason why I might not buy the game. Because I generally want a modular map or different setup to have more replay value.

But this game was very impressive mechanic wise. First, it's simple to play. You basically play a movement card with some optional special cards and that's it. 

Second, you do not have to know all the cards in your deck like it's the case for many historical war games.

Third, players are playing in groups, 2 for USA and 3 for canada. That what makes the game interesting, because you can talk about your strategy with other players. It makes it easier to find the best move and it makes the game fun to play.

Fourth, the combat mechanic is very elegant. You either hit, move or run. And you roll dice of colors matching the cubes.

The game is relatively simple enough to be considered to be played by non-gamers. I think our game took around 2 hours (not sure) but those 2 hours passed pretty fast because it was so fun. So the time is really not a problem.

The only drawback I see it that since it's a stalemate historical war, you cannot really destroy your opponent or capture his capital city. It's a game about trying to get the advantage and trigger the end of the game. Ans some people might not like that.

Else the mechanics are awesome, and I will probably reuse them in one of my designs.

This is a streamlined, fast-moving "Euro-wargame" highlighted by a "Fog of War turn order" sequence and the "Flee" mechanism.  The tide of war can change quickly from each faction's turn and I love how the end game trigger is determined by one side's Treaty cards.  The game has high tactics, medium strategy and your positions are not very secure, from turn to turn -- in fact, you're not even sure when your faction's next turn may be (you can go 1st in one round and be last in the next round).  I also really love how the dice probabilities of each faction is unique and very thematic.  The tension is high and the turn angst is excellent.  A very addictive semi-cooperative wargame with a high fun factor.

Update (Nov.2013):  For 5 players, play 1812.  For 4 players, play 1775.

Until I see how the Americans can be competitive, this rating will be a bit fluid but I imagine this will become more obvious over time.  The concept is quite interesting with a team of two against a team of three with each person having slightly different abilities/card deck and recruitment levels/locations.  Once a team has their truce cards in play, the end of the round brings the end of the game and the team with the most enemy cities wins the game.  Fairly simple to teach and play.

Andrzej took the American Regulars and Militia, Leo the British Regulars and me the Native American and Canadian Militia in a 3-players game. Each faction would take a round in a turn with their respective deck of cards. The American Militia started the game and then the sequence of play was randomly determined by drawing the turn order markers from a draw bag. I like this random rounds in each turn as you would have some hard decisions to make due to the uncertainty of timing of play. For example, should I cross the lake now before the Americans closed in when their rounds were not yet conducted? Or should I wait until next turn to go only after them?

When a player begins his turn, he will receive enlistments newly arriving (by cards) and all "Fled Units" in the previous turn will return to the "Muster Area" of the nations. Native Americans, while on home turf, can receive an additional unit in any other area containing a Native American unit, even in an area being occupied by the Americans, while they are in combat with the British Regulars or Canadian Militia. I think this is the best part of the rule in the whole game, depicting the "infiltration" tactics that the Native Americans so well trained in.

Each player can play (and must play) one movement card and up to two special cards. Allied units can be in the same area, e.g. the Native Americans can be fighting alongside the British Regulars with the American Regulars. All cards played are removed from the game - yes, no reshuffle. The player without any card to play simply sits out the game and watching. I feel this rule a bit constricted to the gameplay, especially when we are getting used to the recyclable cards in many other CDGs. The movement card is used to activate all friendly units in an area, including those controlled by your allied player. Talks on how to divide and move the units in groups among the players therefore ensued with many interesting conversations during the game. The moving group, however, cannot pick up or drop off units along the movement.

Combat is initiated when Army cubes of opposing sides are in the same area.  The side in whose Homeland Area (denoted by the two major colors, blue and red on the map) the battle takes place would have the initiative, who would roll and apply the results first.  Each nation has a unique set of dices with which, like many other dice games, the frequency of different combat results is distributed pertaining to the national characteristics.  For instances, the Native Americans (and to some extent, the Canadian Militia) have more "Flee" sides than the British Regulars who score hit results more often.  Combat continues until only units from one side remain. Units that flee the battle area would return to the Force Pool and may come into the Muster Area next round.     

The game stops when all the "Truce Movements Cards" are played. The time of the game can therefore be restricted to a shorter span quite reasonably. Our game was completed within three hours or so and Andzrej, with more cards and troops in the end, raced to the lakeside areas, grasped and controlled them. With more areas in American flags on the board than the British, he won the game. 

Although 1812: The Invasion of Canada is quite a clever design, I am a bit underwhelmed by the game because of the lack of history knowledge about the war generally. I can accept cubes being the amount of "influences" in 1960: The Making of a President or a parliament member in Die Marcher. On the other hand, pushing all the un-named, abstract "troop" cubes on the map is a non-human aspect of the game that left me a bit cold. I always feel I am not playing a wargame against the other players in such kind of Euroish game, but against the game mechanics like that in Chess.

Après 5 parties :
Excellent jeu !!

Un jeu aux règles simples (voir même plus simple que mémoire 44 car il n'y a pas de modificateur de terrain) mais qui permet de réellement faire une partie stratégique tout de même. Il faut aussi jouer en fonction de ses cartes en main, il y a donc une grande part d'opportunisme dans ce jeu.

Les 2 camps sont asymétriques et il ne faut pas jouer les 2 camps de la même façon si on veut gagner à chaque fois.

De plus, une partie dure en moyenne 1h30.
C'est vraiment 1h30 de pur plaisir car ce jeu a des règles fluides et on ne replonge pas dans le livret de règle au cours de la partie.

J'ai la version française de chez Asynchron et la qualité d'édition est vraiment irréprochable !

The randomness of the turn order, the cards, and the combat dice are just too much for me.  Watching the Americans roll 2 or 3 Flees in almost every battle made winning feel more like watching our opponents have bad luck and losing and less like we were making decisions towards that end.

One thing I hate about wargames is how tedious they can get. I want my meticulous planning and strategizing to stay in heavy euro-games. I want all the fluff stripped away from my wargames, so I can just dive right in. This is what 1812 does. There's no special rules to remember, no complicated movement patters to memorize. Just take a group of cubes and push them where you want to go. That's not to say there's 0 strategy, and this is just a dice chucking affair. There's a lot of game here, it's just not bogged down in the details. You're able to look at the map from a high-level point of view and easily make decisions about your army as a whole. This game takes all the fun you get from being a pro player in Axis & Allies, and removes the barrier, so everyone can play at that level of strategy.

I love history, especially Canadian history.  As such this game immediately appealed to me.  Then when I played, it blew me away!  The board is a gorgeous map of the main conflict area.  The other components are top quality too.  The game play is super easy.  The dice tell you everything you need to know about combat.  No charts or graphs or any other craziness.  I love this game!

1812: The Invasion of Canada can be played by 2-5 people.  There are five factions that work together on two teams.  There are the good guys: the Canadian Militia, the British Regulars, and the Indians protecting Canada's freedom.  Then there are the forces of evil: the U.S. Regulars, and U.S. Militia.  Each faction has its own unique deck of movement and action cards that they will use on their turn.  Fog of war is created by drawing turn order out of a bag each round, to a maximum of eight rounds.

The game is dynamic, as armies move, and areas of map are gained and lost.  To win, one side has to control more specially marked areas of import on the other side of the border than their opponents.  Ties are possible.  The game could last up to eight rounds, as I said, but could end as early as three.  This is because there are Treaty of Ghent cards, which are also movement cards.  When all Treaty of Ghent cards are played on either opposing side, the game ends at the close of that round.

1812: The Invasion of Canada is beautifully made, and very well thought out.  It's not complicated, and not overly long to play.  If you are at all interested in Canadian/North American history, like light war games, or strategy games in general, I can't recommend this enough.

My first war game! This seemed like a fun way to learn a bit of Canadian history and to be good for my games group as we usually have five. I'm hoping to get a few chances to play the Americans. I guess I can't feel bad if the Canadians defend their territory!

The game is best suited for two or five players.

Suffers a bit from the alpha effect--a strong player on a team will try hard to influence their team-mates.

12/17/11 Played a five-player game; 6 turns in 2.5 hours. (I was the Canadian Militia.) I look forward to playing it many times in the future. I found the production values very good. I like that each faction is a little different. Though I was slightly dismayed by the level of collusion that is allowable between allies (showing each other their cards and lots of table talk). I think that may have possibly unbalanced things considering it was a 3 vs. 2 fight. My only question now is how does it play with less than a full compliment of five.
06/23/12 Played another five-player game, 5 turns in 2 hrs. (I was the British Regulars.)

RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Players split among two teams fight for key positions using dice and cards that are unique to each person.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: It's pretty cool that the dice's sides vary according to the tendencies of the group they represent. For example the British were fighting on foreign soil and had no where to run so their dice represent a fight-or-die split where it's possible a group of militia will split on you in the middle of a battle. I love the huge board and the art is perfect for the subject matter. I found the game educational about an often over-looked period of America's history.

Cons: For me, a key element of a dudes-on-a-map style game is the decisions at the beginning of your turn over the deployment of your troops, but in this game it's set from one turn to the next, you get the same number of troops and they'll go in the same place. It's this kind of over-simplification that makes the experience feel empty. Basically a 5-player only game with any less players being an awkward split.

Other: So I only played the intro game which means I haven't seen all the cards. I also haven't played with a full compliment of players in order to experience the tension of going into a battle with your fellow team-mates. While I'm sure there's elements in both of those things that would make the game better, at it's root there's just not enough going on to warrant the time and dollar investment.

Best Use: Exactly five players who want to play a light war-game.

If I had a friend who had never wargamed before and you wanted to get him into a game with conflict this would be a great vehicle.  Nice use of variable-result dice, good components (except why on Earth did they make the US territory blue?) fast play, some tension (but not too much) and the ability to laugh uproariously at the cowardice of the Canadian regulars, coupled to nice card art results in a very approachable, entertaining game for an hour or two of battling.  Hats off to the designers on this one.

Have tried it two-player and multi-player (five people). Prefer the former since the game is less likely to overstay its welcome. No question that it's fun and tense, with a fair amount of flavor for the different factions. Also no question that it's a long way from being any kind of a simulation. In particular, the dynamics of the conflict seem off; it often feels more like WWI positional warfare (complete with the Big Push) than pre-industrial campaigning in a wilderness.

I really enjoy this game. Light enough for anyone to pick up but your planning matters a ton. Lots of interaction too. High marks!

*update Sept 7, 2012* This is the only boardgame that I really like that my non-gaming wife will happily play with me. After two plays, she's up for more. The other games she likes are Carcassonne (I tolerate it) and Innovation (I like it but play it plenty of times with others, as it's portable. Also, not a boardgame). This game scratches the "boardgame" itch and I now have a permanent partner. Wife hates "always learning new games" and I'm glad this one has been happily settled on as one we can play together for the next while. 

Still a lot of fun! 

*update Dec 2012* Wife felt that this game had too much of an inherent imbalance between Canada and US. I personally disagreed but then I got Agricola and this game never got played again. Excellent game, score lowered from 9.5 to 8 due to more experience with games and this game's replayability. A great investment in general but didn't work out for me.... unfortunately this game doesn't get to the table enough to work out strategies around the so-called "imbalance". Having said that, I'll probably still buy 1775 when it's in stores, though won't kickstart it

*update Jan 2013* I'm a hypocrite. I kickstarted 1775 and do not regret it!

*Feb 2013* Having played a game of this last night (Feb 1), I realized it really is a great game and it's off the chopping block.... at least until 1775 arrives, but maybe forever. It's really fun!

After 4 plays (two 2-player and two 4-player) it's a good one, though it seems that 2 and 5 would be the best counts. A lot of interesting decisions and risk management with a low rules overhead. I like the idea of team play, though my wife (who REALLY liked the game) said she prefers not to be on a team so she can control everything. 

I'm not convinced that the game is balanced, the Canadian side seems to have a pretty decent advantage. Winning as the US feels like winning as the humans in BSG.

I'm not sure enough dice end up being rolled to make the luck of the roll feel like it evens out. Three Canadian plays versus two American plays certainly *feels* unbalanced, even if it's not.

Wow, I don't even know where to start. This game was an instant hit in our gaming group and this is coming from a crowd of people, where only one half is actually interested in history at all - or historical games for that matter. When I introduced the game boldly with its title - "1812" - you could already see some of the lads rolling their eyes. But 1812 succeeds, where other simulations have failed: it is an elegant and very lean design, that still manages to capture all the pistons of the conflict it tries to depict. The cameraderie when played in multiplayer, when you are actually allowed to move your team-mate's units, the cheering, when you managed to succesfully fend off an all-out enemy attack. In multiplayer, it manages to feel like a coop-game, where the other team is the challenge you are trying to overcome. The other side almost fades out into mist, as you are eagerly anticipating what they are up to next. Great game!

I don't know whether to love this game or hate it.  It was the first game I got.  My wife met the designer at an 1812 event in our home town and he was selling copies of the game.  She got it for me and it has opened up the Pandora's box of gaming.   Many thousands of dollars and gaming hours later this is still one of my favourites.  Our group always has fun playing it and it plays fast enough that you can get a few games in in an evening.  While not strictly historically accurate it certainly plays with the right flavour for the war of 1812.  There is an American revolution game in the same series which I purchased and there is supposed to be a French and Indian war version coming which I'm sure I will also purchase.

Mostly played 2 player. The quick setup is a real boon as you can be playing so quickly after you pick this off the shelf.  The American side does appear to be at a disadvantage but this has evened out as we have played more and the difficulties for the British/Canadian side have become more apparent.

I really like how Supply and Control are represented so simply in this game and how you don't have perfect control over your troops.

Good game but the newer version of basically this same game, 1775: Rebellion, is better on all aspects so I really don't see any reason to play this instead. The biggest flaw of 1812 is the fact that reinforcements always appear in the same place. This by itself makes 1775 a much more interesting game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this 2-5 player, multiplayer cooperative game, the British are fighting the Americans in the War of 1812. There are 5 possible armies: English regulars, Native Americans, Canadian militia on one side and the American regulars and American militia on another side. Each army has their own deck of cards. Each army is different from their dice; for instance a weaker amry would have more flee results rather than hit results in combat. The turn order each round is different, and by randomizing it, an army could go twice in succession.  You play a card(s), move and conduct combat with dice. The game ends when one side have played all their truce cards from their decks, and whoever has the most occupied areas, wins. 

I didn't think it was possible to have teams play a side, especially with uneven numbers, but it works really well. There are a ton of choices and opportunities on where to attack and what strategy to try. The games clock in pretty fast, at around an hour or so. I enjoy this game and look forward to more plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light game with easy to learn rules. An enjoyable introductory wargame. While it's not an especially deep game, there is enough there to allow some room for  strategy to develop. A few of the comments mark this as some kind of a wargame/euro hybrid, but in my estimation there's nothing "euro" about it except for the pieces. 

Personally, I have no complaints about the wooden bits, which are functional enough for what the game is trying to accomplish. The map is quite nice, I think, and the artwork on the cards is pleasant. The different sides each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the differently weighted battle dice for each (they are tuned for each faction) are a nice feature. I think that this game would be especially fun with a full complement of five players. 

All in all, not a bad place to start for newcomers, and a good choice for a grognard looking for something quick and fun.

I like it. Less than 1775, but still liked it. The blue color of the US side of the map annoyed me as it felt like water, but other than that the map once again looks wonderful. This one felt much more of a tug of war than 1775, because of how difficult it was to come in at the front. Between the two I'd pick up 1775.

Gioco molto interessante, anche se la componente fortuna (con lancio dei dadi) la fa da padrone e, per un gioco di questa lunghezza, potrebbe alla fine risultare fastidiosa. Il gioco comunque è simpatico e riprendere avvenimenti storici. Gioco da me comprato e rivenduto appunto per il fastidio della forte alea ma non mi sento comunque di sconsigliarlo a prescindere.

I like this one quite a bit. It was probably my favorite new game I played at strategicon(orrcon) 2013. The luck of the dice is definitely there, but it is very accessible and offers interesting decisions. If anything my only complaint is that it ran a little long for what it was, but it was our first game so I imagine the next one would go quicker. We played with 5 people.

Sort of advanced risk for gamers, amassing troops and letting rip with them to gain VP spaces in enemy territory. The limiting aspect is that in any given roll you're limited to the amount of dice given, so excess troops are only required to cover potential losses, which sensibly limits army size. Americans have 2 colours, the British have 3 colours, and in any given turn each colour moves once, where you choose cards from a hand of 3 which dictates how many armies (between 1 and 4) you can move in that colour, and how far each army can move (usually 1 to 3 spaces, or sneak over the lake, which usually sets the cat among the pigeons). But within a turn you don't know who will move next of those colours who haven't gone yet. So you might get 2 or 3 turns in a row to really make inroads, but the wheel turns of course. So there's swings with turn order and swings with the dice. There can be some agony because there's not enough troops to cover everywhere, but that also means there's no turtling, there's always somewhere worth having a lash at. As a result, turns play out in a reasonably quick timeframe, combat is fun, and there's nice back and forths. Lots of luck but lots to like.

I have the others in the series and this is probably the weakest of the three for me. A lot of that has to do with this being the first in the series and the series has improved with subsequent releases. It is still a good game, mind you and I find it the easiest of the three to teach but 1775 and 1754 are better games (IMHO).

The three versus two battle mechanic is great as you must discuss between each other on how to win. Each army has its own strengths and weaknesses and thus you must often sacrifice yourself to help out your teammate. Yes, there is luck with the dice role, but since each army is limited in the number of dice you can role during each round of battle it leads to a lot of tense moments. A great surprise.

RATING: 9
I'm giving this a "9" for now but I might just be intoxicated by the truly beautiful components. It does play like a dream though. The system is not complex, but there is considerable variation built in with the (aesthetically beautiful) cards, and a slightly variable setup for the campaign game (which plays so quickly I can't really see any reason not to play it everytime). Battle outcomes can vary widely with the iconic dice (love those dice!) so you will have to adjust your strategies often, which may annoy some but I find that to be more "realistic". The board is too big to fit under my plexiglass, but it is so well made that it lays completely flat, even at the seams & joins. And it's very visually pleasing (surprise!). I'm also really liking the end game mechanic (the Truce cards), though it's much more easily manipulatable in a 2 player game. Overall just a great system with (beautiful) top-notch components. 
-----
Alas the beautiful board has begun to warp ever so slightly. Nothing out of the ordinary actually, but it means I will have to put it under plexi. And my sheet leaves about an inch and a half un-covered at one side or the other. I cannot bring myself to lower my rating though. Still an outstanding game.

[Second play] Played a two player game as the American side. Squeeked out a win in which I successfully took Montreal but had it re-captured before it could cost the British reinforcements. Lots of game here to explore.

[First play: 8] Played a five player game in which the British/Canadian side won handily after managing to occupy an American muster point for three turns denying them 12 armies. I can see where the complaints of imbalance come from but I'm not sure it's as bad as some suggest. I definitely want to see this get more play.

This is the first game in a long time that made me feel ignorant. I was completely unaware of this portion of the War of 1812. 

1812 is a lite war game that offers just the right mix of strategy and luck. It seems to favor the British/Canadian side but then Montreal is not part of the US (as far as I know).

There is a good deal of back and forth. I think anyone who enjoys the more complex versions of Risk or the Axis and Allies games would enjoy this.

RATING: 8
Simply put, it's team Risk with a convincingly applied theme and a guaranteed game duration of a maximum of 90 minutes or eight turns. If you want a game that has more strategic depth than what Risk could offer (and admittedly, Risk does offer some depth), then this game might not be for you.

==================

I have no idea why this is being compared to a Euro. It's a war game with a convincingly applied theme. (If Risk had wooden cubes for its units and cost about $60 retail, would you call it a Euro?) In fact, it's impressive how much theme is packed into the game with a minimum amount of rules:

* Naval warfare is totally abstracted out, replaced with special cards that allow units to cross lakes. These cards are very powerful when played at the right time.

* The powers of each faction vary by their effectiveness to roll hits (by differently marked dice) and ability to move (by the kinds of cards in each faction's personal deck). In addition, each faction's personal deck of cards has special power action cards that feature significant events and leaders during the War of 1812, such as General Brock, Chief Tecumseh, and Laura Secord.

One thing I was worried about was that it's really a two player game; when you have more than two, then players have to play in teams, which usually devolves into one player making all the decisions for his or her team. What ameliorates this is

(a) each player/faction has a separate deck of cards 

(b) it's better if more than one allied faction participates in a battle: Each faction has a maximum number of dice it could roll regardless of the number of units it has in a particular army group. More factions means more dice.

The only fault I find with this one is that it's a bit too long for how light the game is.

If you had a choice between Columbia Games' War of 1812 and the Academy Games version, I'd lean towards Columbia Games' version. That game has more tension, more tactical options, a more convincing game when it comes to the basic move counters and roll dice, and a more dramatic end-game.

* In the Academy Games version, the game ends when a certain card (The Treaty of Ghent) has been played by all players by one team. Whoever controls more opponent cities at this point wins. This mechanic could create a lot of excitement, as one team is trying to get through their factions' decks of cards to get this card before their opponent invades. This could also make the game drag if one team is obviously going to lose. More importantly, because units are "recycled" more often because of the fleeing mechanism, it's easier for players to hold opponents' cities. Compare this to the Columbia Games version in which the number of units is very restrictive: the more a player expands into foreign territory, the more spread out his units must be.

To summarize, it's a light war game with a cleverly implemented theme that overstays its welcome a bit too long. I prefer Columbia Games' treatment of this war. However, Academy Games' version accommodates up to five players and the rules are short and very easy to explain. So if you generally have more than two players in your gaming group and relatively new to war games, I would recommend this over the Columbia Games' version.

Simplicity can be a virtue, especially when the rules get out of the way and let you focus on strategy -- and actually get the game to the table. Still, need more plays to decide on whether there is enough complexity here to keep me interested in the long term. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Difficult to rate after one play. Very light wargame, but there's very few multi-player wargames you can play in under 90 minutes. I think with some more play better strategies will present themselves, but there's an awful lot of tit-for-tat possession taking and attacking.

Very little simulation value and tense decision making (hopefully further games will refute this), but combat was a lot of fun! You just need to know how light it will be before playing.

Really didn't like the light blue territory for the Americans on the map - looked like the Atlantic ocean. Bland and gave little feel for North America.

UPDATE: Played a two player and it was a lot more fun - and quicker - than with five. Strategy is limited.

As advertised: good intro war game that supports five players... dice play a big role, but there's still a reasonable number of decision points (do I get rid of a Regular unit to keep the extra Militia die?)... play is balanced, and there are more subtleties than expected... intro game is quick enough to be a filler, and campaign game is enjoyable

There's no question that for me, this game represents a great way to test the bonds of a friendship. Cooperation and communication are key to making this a smart and invigorating playing experience.

The fixed reinforcement places makes this a lot more scripted than 1775. The British side always places his reinforcements first in the setup. I prefer the way in 1775. I think the idea is to give a bit more advantage to the American side.

The British side gets two turns in a row for sure every round and it usually changes things quite dramatically. Getting three or more turns in a row is even more brutal. It seems to be a bit more swingy than 1775 but is a fun game in any case.

Whilst not yet a huge fan of wargames per se, i was fortunate enough to have someone explain the rules to this and give it a try. We also played in mini-teams which is currently my favourite way of playing confrontational games.
There is an element of luck with dice rolls, but this is nicely tied into the potential variability of the unit.
Not a bad game, but not necessarily one for my collection as my wife won't enjoy it.

RATING: 9
This game has everything I want in a euro/war hybrid. Fills the same niche as something like Wallenstein/Shogun but adds enough novel mechanics to keep things fresh and interesting. The battle system is solid and retains the exciting dice rolls of a Richard Borg game. Depending on how the 2 player game works, I could see this reaching a 9. 

As a side note, I'm dismayed at the growing trend of game publishers (small and large) choosing to manufacture games in China. I understand wanting to cut costs, but when I spend $65 on a game, I expect it to last. I have to say that the game board of 1812 is absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, the cards, wooden bits and dice are all sub-par. The wooden bits have the usually bad quality Chinese paint that feels like its flaking when you pick up the cubes. The dice are cheap Chinese plastic, and the black-bordered cards were starting to chip right out of the packaging. None of these issues detract from the actual gameplay, and that should speak volumes for the excellent design.

The European manufacturers have set the standard, and American game publisher seem intent on delivering products to us that are significantly below this standard. I know I'm nit-picking, but I think we should keep these companies accountable. If these production values are the only way to get some of these smaller titles published, I guess I'll accept it, if only begrudgingly.

Update: played a 2 player game and a 3 player game. The 3 player game is good, the 2 player game is excellent. All the games I've played so far have contained at least one epic, back and forth dice battle that determined the course of the game. Each game is intense and exciting all the way through. Bumped my rating up to a 9, and I could see it going up a bit higher if the 1813 campaign adds some longevity.

Light war game with high luck factor. The discussions between the allies are one of the main things in this game and I like that fact. Nevertheless I want to await further plays before I give a definite rating. Not sure if the game is really that good. But for sure it's diverting and full of decisions and debates.

EDIT: After second play my opinion is more positive. There was immense atmosphere coming up. The luck factor can be accepted as an unpredictable circumstance in war.
Explicit  recommendation: play it with full 5 players!

EDIT: Had 4 plays now and increased my rating. It was the first time the American side won. Much fun!

RATING: 5
Hmm... seriously? I came in expecting some tightly-designed asymmetric card decks to take the next step forward in team-based games (the buzz from this game and Academy Games' Conflict of Heroes pedigree made me think so), and instead found an abstract cube-pusher that plays more like refined Risk/Axis & Allies.

Strategy is trivial. Balance your cubes in accessible spots, keep track of what cards your opponents have played (especially the naval movements), and use cube diversity to dice maximally.

This isn't a light wargame, unless you call Risk one too. The asymmetry isn't very interesting either, often relating to things you don't think about (e.g. faces of the die, difference between moving 4 armies 2 spaces and 2 armies 3 spaces, tracking the cards in each other's decks), with only the leaders (special cards) and Native American ability being interesting.

Does have a couple of good design sensibilities for a dice game. Truces provide a 'mercy rule' to cut a runaway-leader game short (something all dice games should emulate). Pillars of the Earth-style turn order system places more emphasis on tactical flexibility than long-term strategy (again, well-suited to dice games). 

I'm not convinced it's balanced either. We already used the variant rules to give the American player a mulligan (so they get equal chance of going last), 1 fewer die for Native Americans, flee checks when crossing the border (which affects both sides equally), but the British dice advantage, proximity to the border and movement advantage (especially with boats) still conspire to make the Americans fight an uphill battle.

Once again, this is a near-abstract dice game, not a light wargame. For what it is, it needs to be a little shorter, and if you're going this route, might as well go the whole nine yards and provide figures (a la Risk) instead of cubes, which wreck the theme even more.

Played twice with the introductory scenario and once with the full 1812 scenario. Invasion of Canada is of the same weight as Risk, but is much quicker. Players align to one of two different factions, so there will be a fair bit of discussion going on when playing with more than 2 players. 

As turn order is not predetermined, it is difficult for a faction to form a solid strategy although it is probably necessary to maintain the lightness of gameplay. I'm not very fond of how intitiative is decided (homeland faction strikes first) as it favours a defensive style of play. As holding onto captured areas is difficult, it seems better for players to build up armies along the border, and rush in for the capture in the last round. 

However, I still had fun with the game, which had a lot to do with rolling the unique dice. Overall, Invasion of Canada makes a good introductory wargame for those who can handle a fair bit of luck and chaos.

[4 plays] My first time we played two games back to back with 5 players. Die rolls and card draws keep this game in the lighter and more tactical camp of wargames, but there are still strategic decisions which can set you up for a better or worse day, luck depending. This is a superbly beautiful game which moves quickly. We had quite a bit of fun getting into the spirit of the contest and mixing it up with each other. 

I played the Indians and then the Brits. The Indians were more fun, perhaps the power with the most fun abilities. Indians are sneaky. Brits are the powerhouses. French Canadian Militia are the cannon-fodder. I haven't tried either of the American forces yet.

I liked this. A really nice dice fest for multiplayer wargame night.

Definitely a tentative rating after a single play. I think that it does a brilliant job of how many forces would scatter when actual combat took place, and the cards make for some interesting choices. The game certainly features some back and forth, and I do like how you are able to play certain cards to decide whether or not to end the game.

RATING: 7.5
Extremely simple wargame with an interesting team element, set during the 1812 Anglo-American war -- one team takes the American regulars and the American militia; the other the British, Canadian militia, and natives.

Each round the five factions move in a random order, recruiting new troops and then playing a movement card (move [i]X[/i] armies up to [i]Y[/i] spaces each) and either one or two special cards, providing unique bonuses to combat or movement. Armies are collections of unit cubes; a player may move any size army which contains at least one of their units. Battles are resolved with dice, with the owner of the territory rolling first. Militia are less likely to hit and more likely to run away than the regulars; the British regulars never flee at all.

It's basically Risk done right. The rules are very simple, the asymmetrical sides add a lot of variety, the limited dice per side limits the first-roller advantage and there is clearly scope for every game to go very differently. On a purely superficial note, the components are lovely.

I wish I could give it a higher rating because there's so much to like here, but the dice, the dice! It's [i]so[/i] simple that there are just too few rolls and too few ways to mitigate bad luck. Actions are sparse enough that it may not be possible to recover. 

The only reason it works for me is the team play. When I am on my lonesome, a persistent streak of bad rolls can get irritating -- I take it too seriously. But in a team context, the shared suffering always makes it hilarious. 

While it's a great game and I expect to enjoy every (infrequent) play, I just don't think it has the depth to warrant a high rotation. It's one I play for fun, but I prefer to play for a challenge.

RATING: 8
Love the simplicity but multiple options of this game and how it allows five people to flex their strategic muscles against each other. Luck that there is, is in turn order and the cards, but ultimately it's a blast with some epic battles that can fly in the face of the odds, some dramatic changes in fortune and always a sense of pressure (from the enemy) and tension (where will he spring up now? if I end the game early will I steal victory or concede defeat?). A really fun, strategically satisfying game.

Risk used to be a favorite game of mine growing up.  This is not really that game but does feel a bit like it at first.  Probably one of my favorite games in our collection.  Several games brought us close to the scenario set up for the 1813 start positions which was fascinating.  Well done rule book and historical information make this well worth the cost.

This is the game that made me an Academy Games fan!

This game is maddening!  The variable turn order is both genius and diabolical.  It can create some really weird swings in fortune.  I love how the dice work as it forces some real choices when losing units.  The cardplay is also quite good, but most of the cards are fairly similar.  I'd like to have a bit more variety.

RATING: 8
Simple yet accomplished introductory card-driven wargame/area control hybrid. The theatre is the Canadian war of 1812 between America and Britain and the two sides are made up of five different factions, the Americans comprising regulars and militia, and the British are made up of regulars, Canadian militia and native Americans. Cards are used for movement and special actions such as events, and battles are resolved with combat dice depicting three different outcomes, namely hits, units fleeing and command actions whereby a player can choose to move units into adjoining areas or continue fighting. The factions play slightly differently from one another i.e. the native Americans can move to anywhere on the board irrespective of which side controls the area they move too, whereas British regulars never flee from conflict, and it is balancing these subtle nuances that leads to successful battles. The winner is the side who controls the most areas of their opponents' territory at the end of the game with ties being a distinct possibility. Seasoned wargamers might find the game frustrating due to the highly streamlined rules but this is a very playable game.

RATING: 7
Based on a play of the introductory scenario this seems to have promise, though could perhaps be let down by some seemingly apparent main strategies. It's possible that the native's ability to cross water prevents both teams just heading for the bottlenecks on the map, but it didn't seem to massively on a first play. Needs further investigation, but a promising start.

Update: There are some major swings of luck in here; with the card draw, the need to have the Truce cards available (you might not draw the one you have for almost the entire game), the dice have hugely variable outcomes with the differences between flee and kill being entirely decisive and the hugely variable turn order. As such this game really only works when turns are fast and you hammer through the game. This is not a game to ponder over.

I think this is a very unique game. Quick and easy to learn and a lot of fun. And a war game that allows 5P. However I'm not sure how much actual strategy is involved and I could imagine a disgruntled loser happily blaming cards, dice, and/or the random turn order!
Nevertheless it gains a point for originality and the research and components I personally think are good.

A very straightforward cube-pushing war game that features a heavy dosage of luck but plays quickly. The battle system is resolved with dice, which definitely adds a luck element to the game, as does the random draw of cards. The random turn order for the five unit types is where the big Luck swings come in, however. This is pretty good as a game, as long as you can stomach the high luck factor. If you're a history buff looking for a War of 1812 simulation, you'll need to look elsewhere. This is good dice-rolling fun, but hardly realistic.

Extensive playtesting and refinement is evident here, from the deck size, the card mix and deck relative strength, to the dice differences, to the map layout. A pretty immersive simulation in spite of the quick play time and high random factor. Yes, the luck is there but this game will have you wanting to play again, just to see what fate brings to the battlefield this time. AP prone players please don't drag this down! It is nice that a two-sided wargame can provide a rich experience for 2-5 players. The simple rules let you focus on the tactics and strategy rather than the rulebook.

The year is 1812. War is raging across Europe and Russia. Napoleon, emperor of France, is seeking to dominate Europe through conquest. France’s enemies, led by England, are engaged in a desperate struggle to defeat Napoleon. England, in dire need of men, is impressing men to serve in its navy. Included are Americans who are pressed into service at gunpoint.
The young American nation objects. Eager to defend its sovereign rights and to strengthen its position in North America, the United Stated declares war on Britain on June 18, 1812. Taking advantage of the British Army being occupied in its struggles against Napoleon, American forces invade Canada in order to drive the British from its last remaining colony on North American soil. Surprised, Britain reels from the attack and now has to face another enemy threat on another front.
In 1812 - The Invasion of Canada, players take on one of the roles of the major factions that took part in the War of 1812. On the British side these are represented by the British Regulars (Redcoats), Canadian Militia and Native Americans; and the American Regular Army and American Militia comprise the American players. Players for each side will cooperate with each other in order to plan and conduct their campaigns. Each side will attempt to capture Objective Areas on the map. When a truce is called, the side that controls the most enemy Objective Areas wins.

Okay game. So much luck. Luck factor is comparable to Risk as the game state was swingy and luck played a part in every aspect of the game. Good things are the asymmetric factions and in this case the assymetric amount of players on each side. Not sure if it is balanced unless the united states make a particular attack and succeed in the following roll-off.
I can't tell if this or 1775 is better, I guess the choice of game falls on whether you are 4 or 5 players in the group. Essentially this is another map and an added faction.

RATING: 8
Very fast-playing and easily learned.  In look and feel, this reminds me a bit of [gameid=12891]. It has strong emphasis on maneuver and opportunism. The game is good at any number of players. Novice wargamers find the game appealing at more players, as they have less to manage, while veteran grognards will prefer the additional control of the two-player game.

The shining star here is the command decision, manifested here as one of the sides on a d6. They allow combatants to move armies into adjacent territory, making this otherwise very strict system seem much more fluid. With the fleeing mechanic that makes the troops melt away quickly, the theme comes through well. The components provide the icing, and make this a truly beautiful game.

I played a five player game. I was the British regulars. After playing we all agreed that the game seems unbalanced in favor of the British. They have better dice, closer to the border with their reinforcements and have three turns a round to two for the Americans. There could be six turns for the Brits in a row. It just seems like too much for the Americans to overcome. That being said we all liked the mechanics in the game.

I love the combat system presented in the "Birth of America" series from Academy Games. It is mechanically simpler than even the Command and Colors system, which is sort of the Gold Standard for accessible war games.

I don't think this particular title is quite as good as the others in the series, probably because it was the first one. The combat system works great as always, but the map is sort of a long horizontal battle line. As a result, there isn't nearly as many interesting "Command Decisions" to be made, as there often isn't anywhere good to go. The system seems to work better in the newer games, like 1775, where the much more open map makes for exciting, swirling battles that chain around the map, triggering group after group to fight.

If you like the history, pick it up. If you just want to play a cool game, then grab one of the newer games in the series and just leave this one alone. The new stuff is much more engaging.

Historically imbued team war game with five factions of cube movement and special dice combat using unique faction military and event decks.  Initiative drawn from a pouch—I like this impact on planning and adaptive tactics. US pushing North to invade and occupy Canada homelands and vice versa. Fled units rejoin reinforcements. Interesting win conditions can be triggered by the leading team by playing out truce cards.  The team play aspect makes this unique.

[i]1812: The Invasion of Canada[/i] is on the lighter end of the rainbow, but still completely solid.  Very few games can hold up to the often-specious claim of being a multiplayer 90-minute wargame. But this game and [i]Nexus Ops[/i] pull it off effortlessly.

Update:

I'm starting to agree with the vocal minority that [i]1812[/i] is unbalanced in favor of the Canucks/Brits/Indians.  I'll try some rebalancing variants and see what happens.

Played a few times at WBC 2012. Beautifully executed, well-balanced game-- genuinely makes a stalemate war into a tense engaging experience! Bravo!

While not a wargame in the classic 20th Century sense, "1812" brings the feel of a murky 18th Century clash in the barely-charted continent, something precision-calculated chits can't quite deliver. Should satisfy any avid wargamer or strategy gamer, and scales elegantly for number of players.

Even after just a single demo game at SPIEL '12, this is easily an 8 and I only see it going up from there with repeat plays.

Daniel and I played the British forces vs Bert and Fredrik as the Americans. We lost due to Uwe failing to clarify the rules for point scoring, by not mentioning that only cities score you points. This was clarified before Fredde and Berra's last turn, and they of course trounced us then.

It was still a great game, and something I'd love to play regularly.

What a great wargame system!  The board and card play is of course interesting as is the team aspect.  I just love how the fog of war is represented by the variable turn order and there is a lot to master here between knowing the odds before you attack, how best to use all the options in your hand and how best to set up your board position with your reinforcement cubes.  I can't rate the game lower than a 7 as the system is just that good.

All that being said I don't like how lopsided 1812 is even if it is historically accurate.  The Americans have a larger territory to defend with less spawning points. That actually is probably pretty well balanced by the relative power of their movement cards... but the Canadians getting a whole extra turn each round and potentially having more dice available for every combat due to their three factions mean this is something I would be happy to play again but would never want to own.  I will be looking to add some of the other games from the series to my collection though!

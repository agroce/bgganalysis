Fairly average tile placement game with one big plus and one big minus. You have a secondary mechanic adding to the placement of your houses by having to water them with aquaducts. I like that. It's not just about the tile placement, but can you also manage this growing "pipe". I'm displeased by the randomness of the d20 roll to place houses in the first place. One could use a variant (say a set of cards per player, from which the player has a limited hand to choose from) which would help mitigate the randomness, but just having to think of a variant cools my opinion of the game. Still, it's a fair playing game that didn't take too long. In the end, it's just okay in my opinion.

hey, not bad!  after one 2p game i was left wondering how much skill one can truly impart on the game, but i enjoyed it anyway.  there are some puzzle-like elements to it in terms of directing canals.  with 2p it might be best to keep a running score on the game so that players know when it's a good idea to end the game without counting everything down.  which is another way of saying i think an online implementation would be great.  simple rules that you can understand after a single reading, easy to teach, quick to play.  a later attempt with 4 was positive, and it scaled well.  still, i feel like i wouldn't mind if i didn't play it again.

RATING: 5.5
This is a very light and highly luck based game and is lighter than might be expected.  Each turn you can roll the die to determine where you can build.  If you don't roll what is optimal - you'll have to adjust the wells and canals to make up your points.  It's possible to lose buildings if a region fills but the houses are not supplied.  If you can deal with the luck factor, the game plays well and easy.  Best as a filler or side game.

10/13/08 - One play that went over quite well.   It was easy to learn, quick to play and fun.   You try to balance your placement of houses, while trying to ensure that they have access to water and, if possible, make it difficult for your opponents to water their houses.   I found it helpful to place lower numbered house tiles early so that later in the game when I had the opportunity to place houses on watered spots, my lower ones were gone allowing me to place two's and three's.   One of those games that will be perfect for games nights/days if there are more than one group playing.  Can fire this up and not take too long doing it.  A mix of prospecting, luck of the dice and prudent planning.

RATING: 5
How long can you build til your luck runs dry? Inconsequential push-your-luck tile-placement game with plots, wells, canals and a 20-sided dice to allocate placement zones on a communal grid. [i]Playing[/i]-by-numbers, or Bingo meets Santiago. That should be a warning to some people.

We needed a quick filler, and since canal-themed games have made a surprisingly welcome splash on our table recently (Aqua Romana and especially Canal Mania), how could a game that smelled strongly like Santiago possibly go wrong?

By knowing that Santiago is out there too. It might be unfair to Aquadukt to make the comparison, as it probably aims at slightly younger players, and a more family-game audience than our lot. But at no time did it really enthuse any of us, and its been a long time that no-one was even interested in a few quick post-mortem comments. That can't be a good thing.

If you think of it as Santiago junior, than it actually does it fairly well. It plays quick (30 minutes tops), looks great, has clear rules and simple scoring, there are some strategy decisions to be made but none so complex that the kids will be flabbergasted, and it has a bit of luck, gambling, and [i]take-that[/i] thrown in for good measure, so the blighters can gang up on daddy too. All great ingredients for a fun family game. But with the limitation of getting a 3 in 20 chance, at best, to follow-up on any ground plans you prepare, it will be clear that this won't drain the fluids out of your brains either, and gamers just have ride their luck whilst going through the motions.

I must admit that in our first game we forgot the lowest-tile-next-to-built-canals rule, doing the designer a great injustice by being lukewarm about his efforts, as it becomes quite a bit more interesting with that subtle restriction. But even with a complete set of rules, it's the uncontrollable scattergun placement turns that spoil it for me. It gives people lucky enough to get early clumps, or more central placements, too much of an advantage. Something that even with co-operation between the others will be hard to negate.

But the worst rule has to be the one that lets you place a well, but no canal in the same turn. In effect you are counting on other players [i]not[/i] using the chance to instantly divert the canals away from you. In a 4-player game it will be attractive to at least one other player. And there aren't many situations where a well can be placed so it is guaranteed to lead to the irrigation of your plots. Maybe it's worth considering placing a well [i]and one canal[/i] in the same turn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The simple rules and fast gameplay are perfect for our family, and yet the strategy is nice and deep.  It is great the way you can try to manipulate your opponents and get them to work for you in bringing water to your houses.  There is a level of nastiness to the game because you can purposely send the water away from other player's houses.  Also there are situations where the areas will fill up and you'll throw away tiles that don't have water.

I like how you can push to get rid of your 1 house tiles so later you're able to place more points on spaces that already have water.  The biggest drawback to the game is the fact that several areas will get filled up towards the end of the game so several rerolls may be necessary to get a valid one.  The variant adding additional randomness to the game seems pointless and unnecessary (we've never bothered to use them.)  This is a fun and relatively quick game that has a surprising depth of strategy.

This is a very good game.  I like that the houses are valued 1-4, so in effect your betting how much the space is going to be worth to you, and how likely it will be that you'll be able to feed it water.

I often play 2-player games, and they're pretty cool.
We play a variant where each player plays 2 colors and we use two dice.  (See my post in rules for the variant)

Brennan totally whipped me at this game. Whenever I put down a well he would build canals IN THE WRONG DIRECTION! It was fun though and he deserved to win. 3-player with Seamus was even more fun.  I punked Seamus on 2 of his wells, but he got me back by placing the last well WAY away from my beautiful upscale housing development!  The kids have the most fun playing games with me when the rules are simple, a little bit of luck plays a factor, and the length of game is just about 45 minutes max.  NOT simple games, but just not the complex games.

A nice light version (of sorts) of Santiago. I like it. It's got a nice "take that" factor without being too mean. 3 players a decent number. After playing 2 games - the play varies wildly between building-fest and canal placement-fest. Interesting in that it can vary so much and still be decent.

At this stage I'm rating this a 7.5, I've only played it with two players though - and my rating is based on that.  with two players the game is all about optimization, there is little direct conflict.  I can see that three or four players will really bring out the tension in the game and if that is the case I'm assuming my rating will rise to an 8.

This is an extremely simple game, with very simple choices, but you always want to do more than you can and the tension based around those choices makes the game highly enjoyable.  A quick game with plenty of thought involved.

I've increased my rating with repeated plays and with more players - this is an excellent game for three or four, plenty of thought involved, a nice element of luck (but not overwhelming) and quick, intelligent play.

Fun family game where you have to choose between building houses, digging wells or extending the spring to reach your houses.

The die-rolling for house placement seems annoying at first but actually works out to be a fun element of the game since there are pros and cons to being close to your opponents or out on your own.

Kinda sorta fun but the luck of the die, especially late in the game, seems to determine the game.  In fact, I would say the luck of the endgame die rolling completely overwhelms anything players might have done earlier in the game.  A neat game idea that was much better executed in Santiago.

This is a very nice short length game for up to four. Get your houses supplied with water to win the game. But the house placement is decided by a dice roll on a D20 rather than you just choosing which makes it a lot of fun. I love the double canal rule that supplies two spaces either side of the canal with water. 14 Plays.

(An overly generous gift from a wonderful person - you know who you are).

Haven't played this yet, and don't really know what it is about.  Will have to give it a shot soon.

EDIT:  Finally got a chance to play, and I have to say it was rather enjoyable.  The game is light, and plays quick with two players.  There is kind of a race to play the wells once a few households are established, then it is a matter of capitalizing on the placement of the canals to make the most of the wells.

I imagine this game would play very differently with four than it does with two.

This is a simple game that plays surprizingly well.  The building of the sites and the aquaduct suggests a simpler game than "Tigres & Euprhadies" (spelling) and yet more complicated than the entry game "TransAmerica".

Now, here's a good filler game.  It takes 5 minutes to explain, 30 minutes to play, and it's fun.  The fun stems from the fact that, each round, there are some tough choices to make and also from the little bit of push-your-luck factor thrown in.  This was a real surprise for me.  Thought it was great.  I haven't played with 2 yet, and I'm a little leary of that.

The more I play this game, the less I like it.  At first it was ok, it didn't have a lot of depth and could make anyone play it, but when I played with my gamer group, we could all predict the game and everything came down to die roll.  This is why I don't like this game much, the die roll is way too important for the game that even the light strategy part of the game is often irrelevant.  I bought this game during a moving sale at my store for 12$ and it was ok at that price, but should it have been more expensive, I would call it a rip.

RATING: 7
5 plays... It has proved that it can be really fun. So maybe for me it's just a matter of playing in the right spirit (which is slightly wild) to make this game spark. In general it seems like a meaningful game with tactics, luck, and fast play. Despite my doubts I do think different strategies are possible...  I think the board components work well. The board is pretty bland. How would Fantasy Flight Games treat it? Update:  Growing on me!  Very much enjoyed the 2 player variant (1/2 board, 3 or 4 springs, - 2 plays, 2 ties). My rating may rise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rating after one play:  Signs of potential in there but with a D20 deciding where houses are placed, there really is very little skill in this game.  If people tend to keep rolling the same number, then the houses in that region are basically dead, if people roll unusual numbers, the chances are their positioning will be a lot better.  Way too luck based (and I won the game I played so this isn't sour grapes).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I don't mind randomness in a game but there is a threshold that this game crosses. Specifically, if there is a situation in the game where building is all you have left to do and when your choice of whether or not you can even build anything on your turn depends completely on a die roll, it results in a context where a player can experience a hefty amount of "nothing" turns where the player can't do anything. This is especially true as the game is nearing its end since the potential for such "nothing" turns increases as the game progresses and as the board fills up. This serves to reduce the narrative and dramatic tension of the game near the end which is precisely when the tension should be increasing - not decreasing.

RATING: 6.5

RATING: N/A
A series of consecutive bad rolls can hurt, but most of the time bad rolls can be mitigated by careful clustering of tiles, water source placement or by anticipating what other players will do. Interesting choice between instant points for a watered space or potentially more points for a yet to be watered space. It's a game about playing the odds and making the best of not-so-ideal die rolls. It's simple, quick and most importantly fun. Don't expect too much control though. It's a game involving d20 rolls after all.

On your turn you can either place: up to 3 of your building tiles, a well, or two aqueduct segments.  Some ability for 'take that' by diverting water routes.  Wild luck in building locations by rolling the d20 each time can be very frustrating or very rewarding, which really injects excitement, which often = fun.  Very enjoyable!  First play was 3-player.  Subsequent 4p games show that to be the sweet spot.

One play so far.  I liked it.  My daughter (age 9) liked it.  My wife was a little more lukewarm.  Not sure how "deep" the strategy goes.  The rules were a little crunchy on the setup (especially of mountains) other than that it was pretty good.

Update: Played this a few times recently after not touching it for a few years. It's a little bland. But the daughter likes it.

This is clearly inspired by Santiago, as there are springs (plural), with water flowing in up to two directions per spring, with player tiles trying to get watered. Sound familiar? Well, the gameplay is completely different. You have a bunch of houses of value 1-4, and you're just trying to see who can get the most on by the end of the game. The board is divided into sections, and when a section fills up, any houses not getting water will pop off back to their players. Kinda like the drying after every round in Santiago. The two hitches are: 1) You have to choose whether you want to add house or add water (new source or extend existing water) on your turn, and 2) You have to roll a die to see which section you can build a house in. You get three per turn so it evens out a bit. This is nothing revolutionary, but I had fun, and would probably pick it up if available domestically cheap.

Tanga June 2007.  Fun family game.  

Took it with me on our trip to Tennessee in summer of 2007.  Played it a lot (seven games).  Very good game if played with four players, but with two, you can really feel the luck of that 20 sided die.  I'm a bit burnt out on this game now, but will keep it around to see if I pull it out again.

Pulled it out again in March 2008 in a 2-player duel with my son.  Still has a lot of luck in it, but it has just the right amount to make it a fun family game.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Aquadukt es un juego de tentar a la suerte que recomiendo a la gente que le gusten los dados y putear al contrario, cosa que esta realmente bien conseguida. Faidutti lo pone en el very best aunque siendo de un autor un poco desconocido, de una editorial que no mete mucho ruido y debido al uso de un dado D20 en el juego, hace que se quede abajo en el ranking de la BGG.

Este es un excelente ejemplo de como hacer un juego sin saber mucho de números con un diseño sencillo y válido para cualquier tipo de jugadores.[/COLOR]

Luck-heavy tile layer. There's some strategic variance between rapid but undirected expansion (i.e. gambling on profitable lots while piggybacking off other players canal-building efforts) vs. the focused development of existing buildings. Players seem to not have enough control to truly formulate a gameplan. Too random for my tastes.

played twice.  Sad to say, I need a little extra randomness in my games, as many of the games popular in my group of gamers are too strategy heavy to count as "relaxation" for me.  This game hits the sweet spot between my gaming style and theirs.  It rocks.

RATING: 6.5
This is a game where the rules sound more complicated than they are.  It's in fact remarkably simple and it plays very quickly once you get the hang of it.

What's interesting is how a 4-player group will likely move together.  Does everyone build up houses first and wait to see who taps the first well?  Or do they all place the infrastructure first and then place low-point house tiles at the choicest locations?

An interesting game, I'd be curious to see how different it might be with 2 players.

I like the theme of irrigation, the scoring mechanics are interesting, but I hate the high degree of luck brought in by the d20.  A rules variant that mollified that aspect would improve the game greatly in my opinion.

RATING: 8
Components: Attractive, linen-coated board and tiles.

Experience: Very simple rule set leading to interesting choices. It has a press-your-luck quality, as I hope to roll the correct regions to introduce my houses, but without being forced to close a region. There are lots of opportunities to thwart my opponent, and to build efficient networks of aqueducts.

RATING: 8
This was a fun game. Nothing intense, but good decision-making situations and some chances to play the bad guy with your opponent's pieces. Rolling the die (a d20 no less!) didn't seem to be such a 'randomness drawback' because of the way it was figured in to managing your turn: Do I place a tile just so I can roll again? Do I kill myself (by placing a final tile in the area, without having a water resource) so that I can continue my turn? Do I decline rolling altogether so I can start providing water to my pieces?

Resembles Santiago in the goal of trying to irrigate fields before they go dry. The decisions in Aquadukt are fewer and less interesting, but then the game is shorter, also.

RATING: 6
Similar to Santiago in that you put tiles down and try to get water to them.  But has a larger chunk of luck in that you roll to see which section of the map your tiles go into.  Because of this I could see the winner coming down to who gets the luckiest die rolls in the last couple of turns.  But it plays fast and it fits the "filler" niche nicely.  I wouldn't base a game night around playing it.  But is perfect for when you have 30 minutes left at the end of the evening and want to get in one last game.

This game hits the sweet spot for a light game, not too deep, not too long. My wife and I must have played it many dozens of times in the first couple months after acquiring it in a trade. There is more skill involved than what one might intitially think.

As others have pointed out, the 20-sided die that game with the game is junk. Ours rolls 6, 9, and 13 about 5 times as often as any other number. It was simple enough to replace it though.

UPDATE: I dropped my score half a point becuase I have reached "burn out" with this one... too much of a good thing. Also, after so many plays I feel like we've pretty much grasped all the possible strategies and nuances of the game, so our games usually come right down to the wire based on a couple lucky die rolls.

RATING: 7
Yes, it's a game with a die roll and quite a bit of luck, but it plays quickly, there are some nice decisions to make (do I put down that spring?  Do I roll again and sacrifice a city tile to do so?).  If it were a 60 minute game it would be ranked a 3-4.  At 20-30 minutes it breezes by and is quite fun!

One is forced to rely upon the dice for piece placement too much. I'm not opposed to the placement mechanism in the game, but there should have been a way to choose house placement at least a couple of times in the game when you really need it. It's not horrid, but it needs some other element added to it for it to have really worked.

Decent bits, clear rules and short game time make this a pleasant filler. Plays nicely with 2, with a bit more bite at 3 and 4 (as areas fill more quickly.) Randomness of the dice doesn't bother us -- it's not chess, after all. Think we'll hold on to a copy of this one.

This seems to be a good gateway game where you are building houses and trying to supply those houses with water.  The houses that are supplied with water will give you points at the end of the game and the player with the most points wins.  For a gateway game, I consider this to have just the right amount of strategy and rules vs. randomness.  It probably has a little more luck than I would like overall, however, since the game plays so quickly I'm not opposed to playing this one at all or even multiple times.

I purchased this from Tanga a few months ago. When I first opened the box I was very disappointed. I was expecting a more complicated-looking game and after punching and bagging it pretty much just shelved it. Yesterday a friend asked to try it out and I found that it was actually a very good game.

RATING: 8
Amazingly simple to learn, but still retains all the benefits of not being a children's game. Its deep enough to satisfy despite its simplistic rules set.

There is a bit of opportunity for screwage, but often the act of which is also a sacrifice on your part, since you must spend your turn to perform the act instead of working on your own water system.

Each turn is precious in this game, and yet its difficult to make a serious mistake while playing.

Its very well balanced, with a slight luck factor, but the luck adds flair to this game.

WARNING : The English rules on this game are incomplete. The placement of springs is not explained properly. We think a new spring must go a minimum of 5 places from another. A full fresh translation is needed.***Played again. I like this less now. I believe there is something here, but the die roll is a killer. I've marked it down to 5.5, NO a 3 upon reflection! I'll give it one more go and then put it away...***Maybe this game is superb, maybe it sucks. I can't tell from one play. I think we played it dumbly, but it seemed that the die roll had a major effect in the game. The town is in a grid which fits the theme but means that the inside plots have more chance of scoring. Therefore, if you're lucky and roll the inside numbers, you should win. If the town was in a loop somehow, it would seem more balanced to me.It also seems that the players who play springs and canals just serve the players after them, who have the odds of rolling a number that is watered improved significantly.I'll definitely play this some more before deciding, but Aquadukt could turn out to be a great game, or a rubbish game. The jury is out...

The game is kinda stupid. The unfair randomness of the 20-sided dice dictates most of the game. But that's where the fun comes from, and the game is indeed fun. And fast. It's not a serious game (at all) and it doesn't pretend to be one. I must admit that I do rather enjoy it, much to the despair of my fellow game partners who, from time to time, indulge me and agree to play a (quick) game of Aquädukt !

There is a higher luck factor than I usually enjoy... but somehow it works here.  I guess because the luck is one of 3 options -- place 1 well, place 2 canals off a well, OR place 3 buildings (locations determined by 3 die rolls).  In options (1) and (2), you have control.  And most of the time even in option (3) you have choices -- the die roll determines a REGION of the board.

And, since everyone is grabbing from the pool of canals, and that determines game end, you can have a direct impact on how long the game goes on.  

It's simple, easy to learn, quite fun, and has excellent bits.  There's not a LOT of depth to it, but it has enough variety to keep it interesting!

Some have described Aquadukt (2005) as "Santiago Light" and it certainly resembles its more complex older sibling (2003). As I own both games I would say that the connection is highly superficial at best. Aquadukt is quicker and lighter and plays 2-4 players about the same. Santiago is a superb game that can be played 3-5 but is really best with five, so much so that I won't play it unless I have that number (Rheinländer, Traders of Genoa and El Grande all have the same scale issues as Santiago.) I really enjoy the choices you make when it's your turn in Aquadukt, and the D20 is really a "push your luck" mechanism. Do I sacrifice a tile to roll again? Do I score the sure points by selecting canal placement rather than the speculation of finding prime lots for my uncommitted tiles? The decision to place a well is highly strategic in nature as it will have far reaching effects on the game both for you and your opponents. I believe Herr Weber designed something elegant and highly replayable.  Game is dry, even with the canals and wells, however.

A quick game that has more going on than it looks at first.

Where you place your houses is randomly determined by a die roll. However, you have control over where wells and canals are built. The choices you can make make the game a lot nastier than it looks at first.

In fact, the die roll, by adding an element of uncertainty, adds a lot of tension to the game.

Initial rating of 6.5

This is a fine game that serves as one of my "gateway" games.

Q: If this game is any good, why is it so easy to find it really cheap or tossed in as a trade sweetner?

A: Mostly due to TANGA and other "hot deal" E-tailers. One of the controlling parties in TANGA is also a controlling party in Uberplay. Sadly, many people equate the really low price with really low quality, this is simply not true in this case.

Q: OK, assuming thats true, why is Aquadukt a good game and is it as luck driven as I hear it is?

A: 1)Well written simple rules. Easy enough for non-gamers to grasp, the theme seems to help here as well. Very little down time, turns are quick and force you to make tough decisions.

A: 2) People that insist that this game is "total luck" are simply full of poop. I have played 10 games now and have lost only once and that was by a single point. I am not going to tell you that this is a Knizia game, but it certainly does share the "probability management" that is built into ALL of his games.

Quick game on building your homes in vicinity of water, while at the same time you try to direct the Aqueduct to flow exactly where you'll need the water. Screwage factor is great, as you always try to redirect the water from others. Build a building that fills up a region on a board with no water and you'll lose points, so be careful where you build. 

Very enjoyable game and plays quickly, because the building's sites are determined by throw of a die. But that brings a bit of the unknown and unexpected to the game. I enjoy it very much.

I thought I would like this based on reviews I read, but it's a little too simple to be exciting. I've only played it once, and it was only 2-player, but it seems like the optimal moves are obvious. Maybe it would be more exciting with more players? I'd be willing to try it again. I'm glad I only paid $8 for it. It felt like we were just passing time.

I don't like dice games in general, so naturally I don't like this one too much.  There's a press-your-luck dynamic that I don't like either.  However, despite these flaws, there is some strategy here.  Being 2 away from an existing canal (that's near a well) can work fine -- just double the canal.  But when the wells get placed early, certain parts of the board end up being permanently dry.

Ok, I really like some of the ideas here, but that die roll... uurg. The tile laying reminds me pleasantly of something like Santiago or Big City. I think I'd rather play either of those other games though, because they don't have D20s.

RATING: 6
Not a terribly difficult game to learn or play and is kind of fun. Only problem with it for me is the die rolls for placement. One bad roll on your first of 3 rolls in your turn and if your short on tiles leads to being able to do nothing. One in our group had it happen three times in a row. Not so much fun in that aspect. The aquaduct and spring placement are the most challenging part of the game and it's only interesting in the screw factor of neighboring developments you want to cut off. Odd part of the theme is you are building what appear to be residences, but if an area is filled up and some of these residences are not receiving water, you yank the tiles from the game. Demolish buildings that have yet to receive plumbing. Hmmm. Where were the planning & works departments when they started the project ;)? Kind of weird but I guess not uncommon for game mechanics with a theme applied to them. Oh well, definitely not a must buy.

Update: I played again and I like it even more. Bad die rolls can suck but it wasn't as awful this time around. I like the risk taking aspect when areas are getting full. Should I roll and maybe have to place in an area that might bump previous placements or should I just build the aquaduct or place a spring. Greed usually ends up convincing you to roll in hopes of placing in an already irrigated plot. It's now a might buy ;).

First played July 11th, 2007.  Being taught the rules takes 5  minutes and game play takes less than 30 minutes.  With only three choices there doesn't seem like much strategy can come out, however don't be fooled.  It has a decent luck/strategy balance with a touch of take-that in it.  The three of us were amazed that ~3 numbers never came up and some numbers came up once, while others numbers came up ~10 times.  Weighted dice?  I don't know if I'm a big fan of a twenty-sided dice.  I'd recommend giving this a game play, especially if you know someone with the game.  I'd also give consideration in purchasing and playing in your rotation of games on a regular basis.  With game plays so short and still a decent amount of meat in it, it makes it an attrative game.

Have played 2, 3 & 4 player games.  All played in about 1/2 hour and played slightly differently but were fun.  In 2 players you can put down a well and still have a pretty good chance of placing canals to where you want to.  In a 4 player game 3 other players will go before you have a chance to place canals from that well.  There is more luck (rolling the 20 sided die) then I usually like in a game but I had fun.

Fun entry level game for non gamers: plays quickly and the rules are not to complex.

NOTE: My wife beat me in 3 of the 1st 4 games we played.

Tanga Trash?  Nope, I don't think so.  It's actually quite the cute little game.  It makes good use of a d20 and it plays quickly with meaningful decisions.

I also happen to think it makes a pretty board layout when you're done.  This isn't a heavy, 2-hour number cruncher, but it is a fun game you can enjoy when you only have 20-30 minutes here and there.  I think that will help it get to the table a bunch.

(10/07) Not as rosy on the second play.  Kinda dry.  Need to try with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice, simple game which works well with 2 players.  Players roll a d20 (which always makes a game better!) which decides where buildings can be placed on the board, the players then have to supply the buildings with water in order to score points for them.

There's a nice risk/reward mechanic in that you may want to place a high-scoring tile in a place before it can be supplied with water, in the hope that you will be able to do so later in the game.  I also enjoyed being able to redirect the water routes away from my opponent's buildings, scuppering their strategy and forcing a rethink.

Only slight niggle with the game is that once the numbered areas start to fill up towards the end of the game, you often have to reroll the die many times in order to get a valid number - which is a bit tiresome.

Overall an entertaining, light, family friendly game.

I purchased it during a tangathon and was pleased with the purchase. It isn't my first grab off of the shelf when I'm looking for a game but I prefer it as a 2-player-game. I've played it multiple times, now, and I suggest it as a light filler game. It doesn't have the theme or depth that I like so it won't be a star in my collection. It will, however, come out pretty regularly just because it's quick, easy, and mostly enjoyable.

Flaw: 
Though I usually like dice, the d20 seems to throw strategy out of the window quite a bit and make it unpredicatble.

Not the best tile laying game, but far from the worst.  Tiles are placed by roll of a die, so there is a bit of randomness to the game... and choosing to take the second last spot in an area, or clearing an area with your own houses, can be a bit of a brain burner.

Got this plus NIS Taboo in a math trade in exchange for RB Beasts & Bandits.

Game about canal building in Ancient Rome, talk about a unique theme! It's a very abstract spatial game, yet, the theme does "fit" nonetheless; it does feel like you are supplying houses with water as you develop the countryside. There's a decent amount of screwage available, like messing with people's canals, or filling up areas to make their houses "blow up". But the shortness of the game makes it feel not as nasty. The game is great for a short, light, yet engaging "before bed" game niche.

I played it 2-player. I'm eager to try more players; I think it might be more exciting, but I'm not sure yet how the extra chaos will affect the strategy.

Like all Uberplay titles, the production is top notch. The wooden canals and glass bead wells make for a simple yet pleasing aesthetic look. There are nice touches to the production details, like the different players (different colors) houses all have a different architectural style. Which makes the game color-blind friendly to boot :-) I'm glad I traded away for this title, I see it moving into my regular rotation.

Superficial similarities to Santiago in theme and in appearance of components, but a completely different type of game.  I like the short game length, but there is quite a bit of die luck involved, making this almost a little like Can't Stop or other press your luck dice games.  The theme is pretty boring and the components are fairly uninspired (especially the tiles), but it's a solid game that I wouldn't mind playing some more to see if it becomes more or less enjoyable.

Simple, effective game where it pays to put down the lower numbered houses first to get later in the game the chance to place higher valued houses right by water. Can be a little cutthroat, but houses do not often get taken off unles it is someone's first roll or they have a single to blow. Love how different the board ends up every game, great replayability.

If you had to re-design Santiago (an excellent game) for lighter play with push-your-luck mechanisms, you probably would end up with Aquadukt.  I think this is a very good light game with some tough decisions which accumulate towards the end.  Yes, luck (a 20-sided die) potentially plays a factor in helping you or hindering you but skill and preparation (knowing when to roll dice to play houses versus knowing when to place springs/rivers) is very important.  If you rely on pure luck thenI don't think you don't really "get" this game (one could make the case that Can't Stop is luckfest too).  Preparing for the opportunities of placing rivers or placing houses is key.  Another approach to keep in mind is to play as many of your low tiles so that when you are lucky enough to roll an irrigated region, you can play a good tile (b/c your low tiles have been exhausted).  It's also a lot of fun to blow up a region of your opponents' valuable but non-irrigated tiles.  Sure luck is intrinsically involved (in a push your luck game like this or with similar games like Can't Stop) but there is also a good amount of skill and decision-making.  If you play poorly (skill-wise), you will be heavily-reliant on luck to climb back in or do well.  I prefer this with the basic rules and don't add in the mountain +/- adjustments (on the back of those tiles) which involves more chaos to final scoring.  I see this becoming another push-your-luck favorite of mine...

Another game that could be under the label of "gateway" games as it is very easy to play with only a couple choices each turn.  Basically, whoever places the most houses in the best spots will win the game.  Up to 5 wells can be placed from which an aqueduct can form which allows the houses to flourish and score points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Relatively quick and light tile placement game which offers the option of building springs or water for known gains or rolling the die and placing houses for possible immediate reward or future speculation.  Ironically for a game about Aquaducts, I suspect this will get a little dry with further play.

Easy to understand and fast to play, here is an efficient game that hesitates between tile placement, gambling and transportation. The simple system opens up quite a few possible tactics. Evaluate your chances of having an opponent building a canal for you, kick them out by closing a zone before they can reach water, agressively build canals to run your competitors out: there is plenty to do in Aquädukt!

Also, keeping track of who's leading and how many sources and canals are left is important and with four player it's easy to lose it. All in all, a very good filler.

Played once where I won. I liked it, but don't really feel like I earned the win. The game has a lot of good things going for it, but the randomness of the d20 is tough to deal with. A card mechanic like in Ticket to Ride might have been more useful to encourage players to plan ahead. 

That said, the d20 keeps the game light. It might work well with the family who are novice gamers and like "take that" games.

I think that this is actually a really fun little game.  It's light with some luck, but certainly has some good decisions to make as well.  It allows you to decide on and execute a strategy for yourself.  Will you just try to get points immediately, every chance you get?  Will you try to set yourself up for bigger points with a combination of moves?  Will you just screw your opponent out of their big point moves? It scales down ok to two players which is always a plus for me.

Wow, this is what Santiago would have been like had it been designed by a randomness-loving madman! 

I didn't really enjoy this game very much at all.  The most entertaining thing was spending half of my turns trying to sabotage one of the other players, only to lose because of a weak move made by a third player, giving the fourth player the game... huzzah!  

I only got close to winning because I got lucky enough to roll good numbers toward the end... that's the problem.

1 play, 4 players.

Rules could be better written in a couple spots. The game is a wee bit random ( and I like randomness in my games ) 

Bumped rating from 6 to 7 after re-playing with proper rules. 
Plays 2-4. 2p is a balancing act. Placing wells near large houses or house clusters is important. The "take that" in 2p comes mostly from initial canal placement.

RATING: 8
A solid gateway euro that is simple on rules, relies on player interaction, and isn't afraid of a little randomness. Almost feels like an old school Knizia design (albeit a bit lighter) with a little TransAmerica thrown in (due to shared incentives in building canals).

Turns are short and offer only three choices. One, roll a 20-sided die up to three times, placing a tile of your choice (houses of value 1-4) in the appropriate numbered region after each roll (you may refuse to place, in which case your turn ends immediately). Two, place a source of a canal at a location of your choice on the board (must be at least 5 spaces from previously placed canals). Three, place up to two canal sticks to extend and direct a canal (or two canals). Whoever ends with the most watered houses wins the game.

From those simple rules comes a very good gateway game. You will find numerous reviews whining about the luck factor due to having to roll a d20 for determining tile placement region, as though the game is devoid of choices. Sorry, but choices are plentiful considering this is a 20-30 minute filler. Here are a few options that come up during the game that let you work with your bad luck:

- If you roll poorly, you can refuse to place a tile and thus end your turn.
- If you roll poorly, you can place a 1-value tile so that you may continue rolling up to your limit of three times. (This balances out with the times you roll well and can place high value tiles.)
- There are usually between 2 and 6 locations in a region in which to place your tile.
- If your opponent rolls well and clusters houses together, you can direct canals away, forcing them to spend multiple turns to get water to their houses. (This is due to the fact that canals can't branch.)
- You can strategically place canal sources to hurt your opponent and help yourself, since future sources must be at least 5 spaces away.
- You can gauge the current game state to decide if it's time to rush the endgame by getting canals out. Similarly, if you've been passing on those poor die rolls, maybe you need to hurry up and get your houses out on the map.
- You can evaluate which tiles you need to water on your own versus which an opponent will guide towards you on their dime (This is the TransAmerica, shared incentive, whatever you want to call it, aspect.)

Look, I'm not saying the best Aquadukt player in the world is going to win every game. This isn't chess. However, I guarantee you the best player will win quite more than his/her fair share. That's how poker goes and people don't bitch about that. Oh wait, actually they do. It's probably the same people bemoaning their bad "luck" in this game.

One two-player game as of 28 February 2008. Fun game that has that "so simple it's deep" feel to it.

Update: down to 6.5. It's still a good game, but I'm mildly annoyed with the d20. We're thinking about doing 2d10 with a choice on either side of the board (red die for bottom, blue die for top).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Semi-randomly place buildings on the board and score points by directing water to them with the same canals your opponents are using to do the same.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Game moves along fast, I can't imagine AP being too much of a problem. The randomness of the building placement helps keep things fast and light while still allowing enough freedom to affect things one way or another. I'd almost dare say, this is a game even my grandma could play.

Cons: Having not played with more then two, I'm not liking the idea of being less in control of canals and especially where a waterhole gets directed after I've placed it. On a whole I think luck is going to play an exponential role the more people there are at the table.

Other: I don't know if my expectations going into this game could be much lower, but thankfully it turned into a pleasant surprise. I ordered three from Tanga and after some buyers remorse before playing, I'm now happy feeling like this has a place in my collection.

Best Use: A truly light, easy-going Euro to relax with for 30 minutes or so.

Combination of carcassonne, santiago and settlers? Kinda fun, goes by fairly fast, not much downtime. Can be played very aggressively/evil, which can be good or bad depending on what side of the fence you sit on (I didn't like that aspect too much). Push-your-luck element mixed with some strategy. Didn't feel like I had enough control over the eventual outcome. 
Would like to play an ironman version where whenever one of your unirrigated tile gets 'bounced', you get to kick whoever rolled the die in the groin. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An enjoyable game of chance.  Control freaks should stay away.  UPDATE: repeat plays have shown that there are some good choices.  Roll so you can place more houses OR add to the water network to protect your investments.  The gamble is IF your houses will survive long enough (if an area fills up houses lacking water are removed from the game).  There's also some good placement choices wherein you're hoping your opponents will build the canals you need for you.

At first I didn't like this: I felt like it was actually TOO random. First play was a four player game, second play was a two-player game. Things are much tighter in the two-player, you can actually develop tactics, and create situations where another player has to help you to help himself. So it was, in the end, enjoyable.

Still a bit dry and abstract for my taste.

RATING: 7
A really nice 'light' Euro where players are constructing (placing) various buildings and must then service them with aquaducts in order to have them score points.

The mechanics are tight, offering only 3 choices each turn and this helps keep the game to a great time frame of 45 minutes or less.

An injection of luck is present with a D20 being used to identify the location of each build. This will appeal to some and not to others and I think it makes it perfect as a gateway game.

For me this game is a diamond in the rough and one that will find its way into my collection in the near future.

Well now!
For some reason, I think I like Aquädukt much more than I really should. It's light, unsubtle, somewhat random and not really that original... but I just can't get enough of it. For what is essentially just a slightly overproduced filler, the game is pleasingly unpretentious. The scores and the situation on the board are easy to evaluate on the go, and the game ends exactly when you know it would, which is usually just a bit too soon. The much-maligned die doesn't really create any more chaos than, say, a deck of cards would, and there's plenty of scope for tactics and underhanded moves. There's tension aplenty for every turn, and while it may be difficult to recover from the depopulation of a high-scoring region, there's always time for a rematch.
The compact coffee table format accounts for about 0.5 of my rating, the rest is all gameplay and good times.

This is a solid Euro design--nothing earthshaking, but pretty easy to learn and play. More of an intellectual exercise, low in fun factor, but is nevertheless intriguing to play. The rules are a bit vague about 'canal' laying, but a check of the Q&A on BGG is helpful. The components from this game (board and tile pieces) are beautiful and really add a lot to playing the game. (The only exception, as noted by others, is the cheapo 20-sided die, which I'd recommend replacing, as the edges are uneven.)

Ooooo I like this game! What a simple and quick week night game to play! You roll the dice and find the best area to lay your house(s) tile...near water is best! Your houses will score nothing or worse may be removed if they are not supported by a water source. So, placement of houses and water are important and luck of the dice will play a role in your progress. It's that simple! It might sound boring...but the game is so quick and easy... no brain burning involved...you might find yourself playing it quite often!

RATING: 7
A pleasant tile playing semi-filler that has tones of Genesis (playing tiles to the board, fast turns) and Santiago stripped of its bidding (connecting tiles to water to score). The board is divided into 20 areas and you can choose to roll a d20 up to 3 times and place tiles in the rolled areas. But you later have to connect them to water. If you spend a turn placing a well, you're in danger of it getting back to your turn and finding that the canals from the well have gone off in the wrong directions (darn those meddling kids!). So you need to be careful with your placement, ensuring other players have an interest in driving the canals your way. I like the rule where if you roll an area that allows you to place directly next to a canal, you have to place your lowest scoring piece (range 1-4). And the double canal rule is nifty as well, allowing you to double up a canal (ie 2 sticks) which will score tiles 2 spaces to either side. There's the perpetual question of placing tiles vs building canals, and it's not unseen that Mexican standoffs occur as to who's going to "waste" their turn driving the canal to mutually beneficial spaces. The game has hefty slices of luck in the die rolls. There's light decisions to make throughout. All good in a 30 min romp.

Note: I believe this is the correct rule.

A light push your luck style game. It builds a game around the streetcar mechanic of Big City. 
I like how the control is in the placement of wells sources and the pipes (aqueducts), and much less so in the placement of properties where the push your luck element fits in. When the area fills up any unirrigated properties are lost. 

For a game with only 3 types of decisions there are enough things to keep your interest. Make sure you have alternate ways to get your property to score. Get the pipes directed your direction. Place the well head where others would want to help you...

It is a short enough game, with decent mix of decisions to luck. Hadn't tried 2 player but is better with 3 than 4.

Jogo bonito mas que termina cedo de mais; fica uma terrível vontade de o continuar a jogar, de tal modo que acho que acabarei por comprar (ou inventar) mais alguns sticks de água, porque este é um daqueles jogos que deixa os jogadores, não com vontade de o voltar a jogar, mas sim, de continuar o mesmo jogo por muito mais tempo! A ideia é gira e o sistema de colocação de tiles também é muito agradável, aprende-se a jogar num instante, tem uma forte componente maliciosa e a forma de pontuar é extremamente sucinta. Merece uma olhadela muito séria.

Another game where the ratio of thinking to luck doesn't provide a rewarding feeling to players. Yes, there's some good moves you can make here, but I'd prefer good die rolls over good planning. Although I like the concept the execution is too random for my taste.

With regards to the easy rules: They're very quick to pick up, but I'm still unsure whether canals can touch each other at the source. If so can canals run along the same route as an existing canal and double up the single canal? I once performed a quick loop back to the water source and killed off the canal from going any further. There was some doubt whether this was a legal move. It seems some players might be using house rules to interpret loops and touching canals because these are just not mentioned in the rules. We've decided to play that canals cannot touch each other and cannot connect to another source (even if it is the second canal from/to that second source), or loop back on themselves. We play that mountains do not block double aqueduct irrigation.

Quick game with easy rules and some nice decisions about building villages and bringing water to them in order to win.  Even when it looks like [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=161&Itemid=1]Santiago[/url][/i], it plays and feels very different.  I think [i]Aquadükt[/i] is a better game, probably because it doesn't have the canal builder mechanic, whish I don't like, but [i]Santiago[/i] is definitively meatier.

RATING: 6.5
This a quick and fun-ish entry-level board game that involves some random elements via-a-vis die rolls that determine where your settlements are placed and some strategery in how you secure water for those settlements by selecting the routes that the aqueducts take.

This somewhat reminds me of TransAmerica in that they both involve route-connection via those little wooden Catan roads and players can both compete and co-operate, depending on whether their settlements are adjacent or not.

Not very compelling (in theme, art or components), but it is quick and filler-ish at about 30 minutes per game. This is a keeper for now :)

————————— update —————————

RATING: 6.5
Aquädukt -- Played once; three-player.  

The game becomes interesting once some regions become full enough that those regions can be completed by the addition of only one more tile.  When the last tile is added to such a region, the un-irrigated tiles in that region are removed.  This sometimes will open that region up for more development.  

Also the double canals can irrigate the tiles on the other side of those tiles immediately adjacent to the canal.  This adds some fun anticipation when we're all hoping to roll a region's number, so we can place a high-valued tile so that it will be irrigated once a canal is doubled.

This is one of those "hidden gem" types of games.  The cover looks attractive and the name is intriguing, but turning the box over to look at the components provides a feeling of "blah".  But then you play it.

The more I play it, the more I like it.  It is clearly an abstract game hidden by a thin veil of a theme, but that matters not.  It can be learned in 5 minutes and most of the strategy of the game can be understood within the first 30-minute game.

The short length and interesting game play provides a very satisfying gaming experience.  Plays well with 2, but only gets more interesting with more players.

Wow, this is a fast game. I'm sure I didn't plan well with double canals and canal extensions so I lost a lot of houses, but it's a game my wife will play since it plays so quickly.

Definitely play the variant where you have to scream, "Who do I have to sleep with to get a drink around here," whenever your houses are not supplied with water and must be removed.

A quality short and fun tile placement game.  There is certainly a fair amount of luck in this one, considering that your moves are somewhat dictated by the dice, but since you have control over the placement of the water, there's certainly a good deal of strategy in this one.  This is a solid choice for something light and fun, and might even be good enough to be moved up to an 8.

A very simple game (rules-wise), where you place house tile in areas permitted by die rolls, and then you must supply those houses with water from wells via canals.  Fun to play, as it makes you think but is not a 'brain-burner' at all, and a shortish playing time too.  I have yet to find someone who did not enjoy this.  Highly recommended.

What a lovely little game that seems so simple and innocent but has some teeth to it, I might imagine with more plays it could get even meaner. Perfect balance of luck (with the randomness of the dice) and strategical planning with choices of what to do next (place buildings, build a well, build a canal). Can easily be played in 20 min, I love games like this! Shame it is so hard to get for a decent price.

very light, plays very fast.  It has a decent amount of interaction in the tile laying and timing for things like the well-placement, and the canals.  And there is a good amount of double think to plan when to strike with those placements and when to go for houses.

That said, there seems to be a limited amount of total gameplay in this title.  There is a single strategy, of sorts, which is competitive--to place your 4-buildings as fast as possible (but still considering placement rolls which can change whether you place or not) followed by a race to control the wells and then a race to get the initial canals routed where you want.  And of course, the risk of losing those valuable 4-value houses is the pointy end of the decision of when and where.

But there is still a fair bit of fun to had playing it before you run the few viable strategies into the ground, and for the super cheap price you can usually find it, it is worth picking up.

Had some neat aspects, and I like that the d20-rolling adds some randomness to your building placements, keeping the game fairly light on the brain-burning (and keeps people from over-analyzing their turns).  The water-laying concept is neat, but Santiago does it better.

Rating after a couple of plays. Ticket to Ride weight game, but more subtlety to it than you might think at first, and quicker and nastier than T2R. If you get bad rolls early on, dump your low value tiles, then later on you get to place your high value tiles next to the channels for free. Very enjoyable.

Cute game. I liked it better than Santiago. You don't find many Euros with a d20. Seems like if you played casually, the game would always end with very close scores. But if you played aggressively, the game wouldn't be as much fun. I guess you could say that about alot of games. Have a nice day.

This has a Settlers of Catan feel due to the die rolling.  The game is pretty light, but its fun.  Not too much though goes into the decisions but it keeps me interested.  This can be a great couples game because there's not a lot of direct conflict.

************************EDIT***********************

This game is awesome.  Yup, very very random with the placement of houses, but it can be NASTY.  You have constant opportunities for screwage by diverting the aquadukts or filling areas that don't have water and making your opponents lose valuable houses.  This is a deceptively simple little game that is much more than the sum of it's parts.  A wonderful couples game if you don't mind a lot of direct screwage.  I love how the die is used in this game.  Really quite simple, but a truly awesome little game.

Sold in my game auction Sept 2009.  Reacquired in May 2012.  I missed this game and needed it back. Glad to have it again.

A step above a filler, but fast and fun.  More tactics than luck.  Scales well from 2-4.

Update:  After further plays my rating stays a 7.  This is a solid game for me.

I find myself coming back to this one a lot more than I think I should given my rating, but it has the right combination of attributes that makes it easy for me to teach to non-gamers (and I do this a lot). I miss Uberplay. I feel they did this kind of game well. Who does this now? Zoch I suppose, but they are usually pricey and large games. Hans-Im-Gluck? Maybe.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 3

Interesting little game. Turns go quickly, as you can only do one of three things on your turn. But the decisions are rarely obvious. I like how you can either play nice or mean, basically blowing up other player's unwatered houses.

There's more to this than first meets the eye.  If you're vehemently opposed to rolling dice, then stay away from this because the d20 does play a role in deciding the game.  However, much can be done with placing wells and canals to outmaneuver your opponents.  And there is enough of this maneuvering to make this quite interesting, especially for the short (half-hour) playing time.  Added bonus for us -- it plays well with kids.

Commented after three games, two were played years ago and the latest one yesterday.

Very clever and nice game, where the content, luck factor, tactics, back stabbing and everything else nicely come together with a very reasonable playing time. Wouldn't mind playing or owning this game.

The idea is to settle an area and build aquadukts to provide water to your own buildings. Area where the buildings are built is determined by a dice roll, but springs and aquadukts can be built freely. There are couple of rules in building, which you can use in your favor and for the loss of the others.

Updated after the latest play, not much to change on the above.

It has a betting/press-your-luck element that intrigues me, but the randomness of the game rubs me the wrong way.  This is OK, but not the kind of thing I'll want to play very often.

Joguinho muito massa. Tri simples e fácil. Bem gateway mesmo. Não sei pq um jogo desses não é publicado no Brasil.

A sorte está bem presente no jogo, mas pode ser vista como oportunidade também. Sempre no início de uma rodada, o jogador pode escolher entre lançar um dado de 20 lados até 3 vezes. Pra cada vez, escolhe um tile de casa para ser colocado no lote correspondente ao resultado do dado. Caso não queira construir, seu turno acaba. Isso pode ser utiizado para esvaziar um lote onde um adversário está prestes a fazer vários pontos, porque quando o lote é preenchido, todas as casas não abastecidas são retiradas. No caso de o local disponível para colocar uma casa já esteja irrigado, deve ser colocado um tile com o menor número de casas disponível.

Outra opção é construir um poço. Dele sairão os dutos que abastecerão as casas. Cada poço pode ter 2 saídas de água, e devem estar a no mínimo 5 pontos de distância de outro poço.

E por útimo, mas não menos importante, o jogador pode construir dutos. Por turno, é permitido construir 2 dutos, mas não é obrigatório. Podem ser usados para distanciar dutos das casas dos adversários, ou então para abastecer suas próprias casas.

Eu gostei do jogo, bem leve.

I played this as a filler. Not quite good, not quite bad. It's playable...

Building houses isn't hard - but providing water is much more so. By following this ancient Roman building principle, a prosperous landscape is settled by the players. But the beautiful houses are useless without water. If a player doesn't provide water for his houses before the neighborhood is completely built up, then the inhabitants - good or bad - must move out and the house brings no victory points. He who uses tactical cunning and a little dice luck to build wells and canals at the right time and secure the best building spots will win!

Gioco carino sulla costruzione di acquedotti che portano acqua a Roma, bisogna capire bene se è il momento di costruire gli acquedotti o se piazzare le abitazioni o ancora una nuova sorgente, ci si da fastidio parecchio soprattutto in partite a soli due giocatori.

It's hard to say what I find so appealing about this game.  It's very simple, but also strategic.  Clean mechanics and it looks good!

There's more than meets the eye even with the rolling of the die to determine tile placement.  It's a game of tough but simple choices.  You can't score points without properties yet you can't score the properties without water.  Overall a nice solid Eurostyle tile placement game.

I liked this one a fair amount.  Much more going on than you'd think from the rules.  Lots of decisions to make as to whether to go for scoring opportunities or solidify the points you have or to mess around with your neighbor.  All in a short and easy to explain package.

the average game. Some tile laying, a bit of screw your neighbor. A few choises, not complex. Best thng to say is that it's short.

Uberplay English edition.  Box lid has two ripped corners (as if someone had stepped on one of the sides), and one of the blue tiles had to be recreated (fairly well I believe), but everything else in in great shape!

Played once (with 2 players). The decisions involved were a bit light compared to the randomness of the dice roll - and I guess control is even lower with more players. Some interesting ideas, though.

Not a bad game, but not stellar either. I think the boring theme is partly to blame. Let's build sewers! Perfect for the budding irrigation engineer.

Plays fast and is interesting.  Is superficially similar to Santiago but is really nothing like it other than wells and canals.  Build houses and supply them with water.

Cool little tile-laying game. Could be played pretty nasty. Has enough strategy for gamers and is light enough for non-gamers. I might have to pick this one up.

Aug. 25. I did pick it up.. and after a 2player game, upped my rating. Very fun, good potential for nastiness. I like it.

OK as a 2 player game, I suspect it would get better with 3 or 4 players.

Players try to build houses and provide them water in a Roman-themed game. Luck is a factor -reminiscent of can't stop but more random, as it is a d20 instead of 2d6.

By all accounts I should prefer this over the similar-themed albeit more strategic-depthed Santiago, especially since I'm not a big fan of the latter's negotiation element.  However, I guess it is just hard to be excited about a game with little to no meaningful decisions.  Every move is fairly obvious, and with the exception of the canal placements, there is literally nothing you can do to affect other people (never waste a turn to place a well, leave the most useless action to someone else to take).  I can see this going well with my non-gaming family, especially since the rules are fairly simple to teach and there aren't a lot to consider.  Would be willing to play occasionally.

I know, there's a dice. I know, it's a 20 sided dice. But ,the game is all about evaluating your risk so it HAS to be a little random. The game is smart, nasty and QUICK.

After 5+ Plays: I do enjoy this.  It is pretty light, but doesn't outstay its welcome.  There is a very interesting mix of very open choices (springs/canals), and very restricted choices (buildings).  It doesn't have much in common with Santiago (despite looking similar), but I'd take this over that more respected game any day.

Nice game, nothing spectaculat but easy enough to be played with kids. One of the few Eurogames that uses a D20. Also nice is the addition of some historical information in the rules.

Quick, light game that can be taught to just about anyone and probably makes for a good gateway game. The only drawback is that it's pretty abstract and the theme doesn't help escape that. Decent family game.

Construir casas no sirve de nada si no las provees de agua. Jugando estratégicamente y teniendo algo de suerte en los dados podrás construir canales que te permitirán proveer de agua a tus habitantes antes de que el vecindario esté completo.

RATING: 10
Brings the excellent solitaire WWII Ambush series to the Pacific theater. Eight Scenarios. Many of the scenarios are pretty brutal. Be prepared to loose more men than you did playing Ambush. Those Banzai charges are pretty nasty! Great mechanic and very realistic. Also adds caves, tiger traps, quicksand and Japanese officers charge assaulting you with Samurai swords! What more could you want. You'll never care about 8 guys written up on a piece of paper more than in the Ambush series. Some of the best narrative created in any game I've played.

The Ambush! system transported to the Pacific Theatre.  Adds a few new terrain types (palms and jungle) some rules (Japaneses Banzai charges, etc) and some new weapons (including flamethrowers).

But somehow the gameplay wasn't as satisfying as Ambush!  Didn't even bother getting the expansion "Leatherneck".

I just don't like most solo games (but I'm OK with soloing a multi-player game, especially to learn the rules). I generally find the solo mechanisms too much work. Cartoon-ey maps turned me off too. Traded to someone who will hopefully enjoy it.

It's been a very long time since I played this game but this was the first game I played that made me feel like I was reading a book.  It transported me into a new world and kept me there until the game was over.  Now, a bit older, I'm less interested in playing war games (as I've had an opportunity to live them) but I can't help but feel a little nostalgic for Battle Hymn.

RATING: 6
The Japanese behave very much like the Germans in Ambush!, unfortunately, which was a missed opportunity. Taking out caves and snipers in trees is not as exciting as the more mobile duels in the Ambushs! series, and the designer seemed to believe that they could make the game more challenging by simply adding more heavy machine guns that ambush you. Still not bad, but get the Leatherneck expansion (whose missions are better), or just stick with Ambush! - which probably has more than enough missions with all the expansions to keep you happy.

While the system is the same as Ambush, which I rated 9, there are some flaws and errors in the paragraphs that can bring your campaign to a screeching halt.  This obviously wasn't vetted as well as Ambush.  A shame too, since the the scenarios are simply oozing with PTO flavor, and many of the special rules (palm-tree snipers, booby-traps, banzai charges, etc.) also ooze with flavor.

+ Very fun and immersive wargame in the Pacific WW2 warfare. A real pleasure to play in solo against Japanese soldiers with their own characteristics. 
+ Rules are easy to learn and well written. 
+ Components are very nice and mapboards are cools but unfortunately unmounted like all VG games.
+ One the best 80's solo wargame ! Highly recommend !

Ambush! in the Pacific.

I have Silent War and B-29 already, both solitaire games about US military operations against Imperial Japan during WW2.

So i have two solitaire games about attacking Japan - one at sea, and one in the air.

IF i got Battle Hymn the trinity would be complete.

A solitaire game featuring fighting against Japan by ground/land.

Awesome.

Also helps that Ambush is a great system.

I've played all the scenarios, but I still like to play this.  I referee it and play the Japs as per instructions, with 1 or 2 people playing the yanks.  This is a system invented by a mate of mine for Ambush!

The verdict of players is that Battle Hymn is more brutal and it is a lot easier to die despite the players best efforts.  As this can mean the end of a favourite campaign character, it can be very unpopular.  The preference is for the kinder battlefields of Western Europe.

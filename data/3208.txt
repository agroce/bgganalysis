(7.3) Rated after 1 play.  Gameplay well integrated with theme.  Good balance.  We all got bitten by a little AP during the game at different points, but I think after repeated plays that will go away as we become more familiar with the decisions required.  Great components; some hidden information (ala Samurai, where stuff everyone saw you take is hidden behind a screen).  Good special abilities via tokens.  I enjoyed it!  Better gameplay than I was expecting.

While this is a simple pick-up-and-collect-things game, it is a well-calculated Knizia design. The game is simple and straightforward, but Dr. Knizia has calculated everything well so that even adults will find plenty of interesting decisions in the game. The faces on the two dice, the path lengths and the rivers between the volcanoes, the number of diamonds vs. other gems and eggs, the types and numbers of the tokens (with a random token secretly discarded during set-up), ... everything goes together well to make this a substantial game despite the apparent simplicity; everything is not randomly thrown-in but rather optimized to give us a good Knizia game. Do I take a diamond, two colored gems, or the egg plus the token? Do I sit on a perimeter volcano and collect treasures there, or do I move on and try to get to the richer center volcanoes sooner? Do I get the rings first to end all worries, or do I race for the gems first and hope to get the rings before the game ends? (The gems are first-come-first-get, while the rings are essential but always available at the specified volcanoes.) Give the same concepts to any other designer, and you'll probably have a children's-only game which is boring for adults, but Knizia has made a game which is interesting for both adults and children. I have played this game many times, and am still willing to play again any time. The only drawback, if we may call it such, is that, for a family game, the adult or skilled player/gamer may win too often!

Roll and move set collection game with a dragon theme. Probably the best roll and move game I've played. All about making the most efficient movement choices on each turn and making sure you get a majority of the eggs. Seems simplistic but there are plenty of twists and choices to be made along the way. Has more depth than you might think but still a fairly light game. Nice family game. My two daughters really like this one. Also, the only game I know of that comes with a standard dice tower in the box. Nice components.

Lighter game, a bit of strategy, but still a game I would play. Great for kids, nice theme, easy rules. Even has an ultra cool dice tower.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
08+ or 09+, 2-4, best with 3/4, 45 mins. Roll & move set collection with twists. Might work for after school games group BUT to lose even 1 of the tokens would ruin the game. Great components. Nice light tactical decisions for kids but need some maths skills for scoring. The 'Tower of Destiny' is the dice tower. 6 sided dice are 1-3 and 2-4. Notes: The player gets the magic token only when he gets an egg. Getting a ring is instead of, not in addition to, getting some other treasure.

A nice collection game often with a race feeling, I like the tower of destiny (a tower dice) too :)

RATING: 6.5
Quick and easy.  Fun, but not very complicated.  Having to "ring" your companions is what really makes this game.
Scoring is tied strictly to this mechanic, but its timing makes all the difference.

The game can be as short or as long as the players want it to be, since end game is triggered only by the acquisition of the last dragon egg.

This game is nice when we want a lighter, under an hour game. There's dice rolling, so there's obviously randomness. But there are choices to be made, so it's not totally brainless. All of our games seem to end up pretty close. And the dice tower and jewels are pretty cool.

RollAndMove, SetCollecting, MultiOnly

I like this game for the theme and the mechanics; there's a lot more here, game-wise, than you'd usually expect from something as gaudy as this.  But then that's Knizia at work, which is most obvious in the set-based scoring and in the unique concept of your own pieces being the same shape but different colors, and no "One True Strategy" to follow.  I really like the included dice tower, too, even though it's only cardboard with a plastic base.

It is an excellent light game.  Currently in contest with Aladdin's Dragon for best light game to while away a lightly roasted brain evening with.

RATING: 6
It is games like this that show me what people are talking about when they claim Knizia's games just paste on the theme.  Other than the artwork on the board, box, and tiles this game has absolutely nothing to do with a fantastical land filled with dragons.  It is a pure and simple set collection game.  But that's not to say it is bad.  In fact I find the game thoroughly interesting.  I love the idea of the shape of your pawns being the identifying factor, and the color determining what gems you can claim.  However this can be a bit difficult for some players to adjust themselves to, especially those who traditionally play with one of those colors.  Locating your pieces on the board isn't quite as intuitive as I'd like, but the mechanism is so unique that I'm willing to deal with that.

The special action tiles are an intriguing wrinkle in the game and offer a little more control over things.  I love games where, on your turn, you have multiple different options that all would be positive for you yet you can choose only one.  This game totally delivers that.  Players will find themselves with a pawn in a volcano where they would like the dragon egg, the gems of their color, a diamond, and a ring all at the same time and can only choose one.  I can see multiple intriguing strategic options (and opportunities to block your opponents) that I'd like to explore in this game, so I can see it hitting the table quite a bit in the future.

I can't really bring myself to say anything to unkind about Dragonland because as a family game it play exceedingly well.  Unfortunately, I don't have a family to play with at the moment and prefer meatier games and thus Dragonland fails to win my attentions.  That is essentially my review; if you are looking for a game accessible to a wide age range then look no further, otherwise you can give this a pass with assurance that you aren't missing much.

A rather clever roll-and-move game.  Set collection is the main objective, but in addition to grabbing gems & dragon eggs, you need to get the weird, white rubber belts... or lose all gems of a particular color.  Not a bad game, but it didn't thrill me.

IMHO Knizia scores a really fine family game with this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We quite enjoy this.  It's really good for younger kids, with parents' help, to learn planning and optimization.  It's also actually pretty fun for adults as well.

What makes the game work well is the "damped" dice that range from 1-3 and from 2-4.  It keeps wild swings from happening and ensures that no one's going to lose simply because they rolled a bunch of ones to their opponents' sixes.

The theme is of course somewhat childish, but it's still fun for adults.  There's ample opportunity for cutthroat play (jumping ahead and stealing stuff someone else is angling for) if you want to go that route.

The more I play this, the more I like it, but it really is lacking with only 2 players - not recommended for that number.

RATING: 5
OK family game.  It can get a little mean if someone falls behind on getting rings for their companions and the other players rush to end the game, but that generally happens only on initial plays.  Once players have experience with the game they know to look out for that.  I don't much care for the game, but the kids love using the dice tower so unfortunately it gets more table time than I would like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If you're looking for a heavy and mean strategy game, you'll have to look elsewhere. But [GAMEID=3208] is a usually friendly family game with some potential to mess with the other players (summoning king dragons out from under them, magic handing the treasure they wanted, trying to block a path with two of your pieces in a row, etc.). I liked it, but not quite as much as [GAMEID=9021], which for me has a similar feel in a different theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Once again, I'm a bit surprised by the negative initial buzz surrounding this new Knizia title. It's no Ra or Taj Mahal to be sure, but it's got a lot of tough choices and interesting decision-making. The dice are non-standard so the randomness isn't so bad, and adds a nice unpredictability to the game. The special powers are more useful than you think. Like most of his big-box games, it's well-balanced and tight. Plus is scores by being short, but packing a lot in. This was good for an immediate second play. I think this is a very solid game which scores by being quite accessible - like Adel Verpflichtet, it's a solid game that gamers will enjoy, plus they can play with non-gaming friends or kids and everyone will have fun.

I have only played this with my youngest daughter, who seems to really enjoy it.  I think some of the tactics are lost on her, but she likes the theme and the pieces.  It's a Knizia-like set collecting game, with some extra power boosts that you can grab while you wander the kingdom.  It may turn out to be a good game that younger kids could play yet still has room for some deeper choices as they get older.

Lots of little geegaws and calling the dice and dice tower "destiny cubes" and "the tower of destiny" were cute, but this game is just nice filler, not much more.  I didn't see a lot of strategy to it, and not as much interaction between players as I would have liked.

This is a very good family game and a pretty good gamers game.  Definitely play it if you have the chance.  You might like it a lot.  

DragonLand is a fairly simple pick up and deliver game with typical Reiner Knizia set collecting scoring.  The components are beautiful and the theme is fun.  There is nothing particularly innovative, but there are some unique twists to established mechanics.  As usual, Knizia has put everything together in a very tight package that works well together.

RATING: 8
So far this is my favourite Knizia game.  The art has an old-school feel, and the components are great, especially the dice tower! The game is a classic set collection game, with a roll and move mechanic. But because of the special dice, action tokens, and the fact that you choose 2 of your 3 pawns to move each turn, it is nowhere near as random as you would expect for a roll and move game.  It definitely rewards skillful play, and so far Kelsey has destroyed me at it both times we've played.  We've played once with 2 and once with 4.  I preferred the 4 player game because there was more competition for treasure, but Kelsey preferred the 2 player game because for her there was too much downtime between turns in the 4 player (partly due to one player with bad AP).  I think next time we'll try it with 3.

This is a light game by Knizia's standards, but while children might like to play it, they probably won't beat the grownups--the set building and fiddly bits will likely be a bit beyond them.  Still, it's great fun to wander around the board and collect pretty baubles, even if you don't win.

Played the game for the second time and still really enjoyed it. Both times we played, someone went out and bought it. Some reviewers say it is to childish a game, but it is what it is, which is a light, fun game. Move around and try to get as many diamond gems that are wild or eggs and colored gems. You also should move around the volcanos to get your rings first, as soon as all tiles turned up, because you don't score pts. for any gems of the color that doesn't have a ring on game piece. Get this game; you won't be disappointed. None of us have been. Easy directions and easy to teach. Not a long game either. Have Fun!

This game has a lot more going on than appears.  I liken it to an Elfenroads sort of traveling game with T&E scoring.  It's fairly simple, but a lot of fun.  The dice and hidden tokens add a suitable amount of chance.  The non-uniform dice distribution tempers the luck factor.

Oh, and the included Destiny (dice) Tower works well with other games.

Dragonland is a light and fun game with surprising depth. We think it's fine with two players. We haven't played with more. The rules are easy to explain and remember. (Only the dragon-flying and -summoning are a little hard to get at first).

The components are fine for a family game.

My family likes thematic games and I like Knizia.  It went over very well.  Enough choices that it does not play itself.  The dice are not that big a deal because they are not standard d6.  It has lots of glitz and a dice tower, so it draws people in.  I had high hopes for this and they were met.

I really like the theme, the strategy, even the balanced random elements. It may be despised by gamers for the roll-and-move mechanic and being marketed as a children's game. But it has the usual solid design from Knizia and the luck factor is much smaller than it may seem at first sight.

Played this first time in a few years. It is a decent game, but the the setup is too fiddly and the board/pieces visually too messy for the enjoyment. I'll rather play something as light, but quicker to setup -game almost every time.

Based on two plays with three/four players I'd say that this is solid family type game, but offers lots of tough decisions along the way. Luck is surprisingly small factor in this one.

RATING: 7
The dice tower is awesome, probably the coolest part of the game.  The game is fun, but aimed more at kids.  You move your party of three pawns around the board to collect colored jewels and dragon eggs.  There are tokens that allow for special movement. The goal is to have the most points by collecting sets of the colored jewels and eggs.  You also need to get "magic rings" on your pawns for the matching color of jewels to count at the end.  Fun game, some strategy.

Mar09: Well, that was solidly "okay".

It wasn't that random.  In fact, I think that was the issue, it was very far from random.  The dice are almost flat and you can see the whole board from the beginning.

I'm sure there's more strategy, but a large part of it seemed to be "get somewhere you can claim two gems with one action".

The scoring is okay, and there is some stress to get all your guys "ringed".

Maybe it would be better with kids.  It's just missing that bit of "excitement" that makes me think children would find it drab too.

Nice dice tower though.

Played it once and immediately wanted to play it again. Not bad, but nothing special either. I just had a lot of fun playing it. It's a quick game too, maybe 30-45 minutes for a 4 player game and 3 of us had never played before. I'm going to keep my eye out for an inexpensive copy.

Excellent, excellent game. I was worried about getting it because of the theme and wondering if it was too kiddish. But this game is great.

I enjoy controlling the concept of the three color pieces and having to use all of them to pick up different gems and complete your sets. Lots of fun with two.

This game has that distinct Knizia feel and despite the bad press it sometimes gets, it's a pretty enjoyable, short, and interesting game.

Treasure collecting in a fantasy environment. Good, simple game, suitable for the whole family. While not a heavy-duty brain burner, the game presents players with many interesting choices.

I could see how this would be kind of fun for kids, though it's not terribly engaging for adults.  It is a tricky little puzzle though as you try to maximize your movement, using tokens at the right time, trying to snatch stuff before your opponents.  It seems like skillful use of the dragons is key.  

My favorite thing about this game is how the rules insists on calling the dice "destiny cubes".  You must play calling them "destiny cubes", which are then dropped into the "tower of destiny".

Good family game.  Uses roll and move mechanic and goal is set collection, which would normally be two strikes against it for me, but there are enough choices to make the game interesting.  The decision of when to take the last egg to end the game is tense (if players are fairly close in scoring) and the use of the tokens make this a lot of fun for kids.

RATING: 7
Seems to be a nice way to introduce my children (when they are 7 or 8) to the later experience of Tigris & Euphrates. It has the "collect sets of colors with your figures of matching color" aspect - the players' figues are in different colors, same shapes -, it has the "execute two actions per round" aspect, and even the end of game condition (the game ends when there is no dragon egg left) is similar to one of T&E's endgame conditions.
On its own, it's a nice family game which might be a roll and move set collection game but is more than that as the tokens, dragons, as well as the special dice significantly reduce the luck factor. I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
has great bits, including a nifty dice tower. the dice are non-standard and have 3 different numbers with unequal distribution instead of the normal 1-6, so it's not as random as a typical roll-and-move. it also uses an interesting scoring mechanism similar to tigris & euphrates.

Fun game. All about the bits! Colorful board and interesting play. We like to use the variation where you can have any amount of gems in a volcano.

Have yet to try it out on our group...

The game play is pretty good -- lots of strategy and decisions to be made.  And it's got the cool dice tower.

A roll and move race game played on several fronts, as players attempt to collect a variety of treasures before other players. The Knizia-style scoring creates several conflicting priorities and enables multiple strategies to emerge, mitigating the feel that you're at the mercy of the dice. Ultimately, it's less simple than it initially appears, making it suitable for gamers, as a filler, or as a game to be played with kids.

This is a very good family game. I am surprised at the relatively low average score for this. This has elements of Das Amulett, and other collection games.
Although we wouldn&#039;t pull this one out wiht a hard core bunch of adult gamers, it is a nice light diversion which still offers plenty of choices and strategy. Don&#039;t let the dice turn you off. Although they let chance into the picture, there is enough to do with two out of three pawns to make each roll worthwhile to some degree. I like Emerald too, but to me this is even better. A good family game! Would be even better if you could play up to five.

We have the English Rio Grande "Dragonland" version. What a wonderful game. Simple enough for the kids to play, and yet can be complex if adults play the game. The kiddy dragon theme may leave some to take this game lightly, but it is not so. The depth of strategy and the number of choices available each turn, the player screens that hide what each player has collected and the special use tokens make for more complex play than at first glance. This one should not be ignored if you like competitive "set collection" games. Definite replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of those light fluffy games that have rules too complicated for kids, but the game doesn't have enough for adults, falling into that unplayable twilight zone that makes it get traded away.

You’ve got three explorers, who wander around the map, from volcano to volcano, picking up jewels and special action tokens. Each explorer can only pick up a jewel that is the same colour as itself. You only have two actions, so you’re forced to forego picking up one of the colours each turn. And the scoring, E&T like, encourages you to pick up all colours evenly (a set is worth 10 points, individual gems 1 point). There are even wild treasures (diamonds) that are highly sought as they can fill in for another colour to make a set.

Movement is similar to Viva Pamplona - 3 explorers, 2 dice to allocate to two of them. There’s a high dice (444,33,2 I think) and a low dice (222,33,1 I think), so you’re never quite sure you’ll get what you need, but you’re usually ok given the low variance. Moving from one volcano to the next is usually 5 spaces, sometimes less, generally requiring two moves. Getting a 4 though allows you to do teleportation moves from volcano to volcano if you can deploy the right tokens, which speeds up your gem collecting.

So the game is one of multiple races in each of the colours - to get to a volcano first before another player can get their same coloured explorer there. Hmmm, now that I’m here, do I take the treasure, or the 2 gems, or the token that allows me to call a dragon and teleport later? And will someone teleport here before my next turn to take those gems if I don’t snatch them now? So, see what the dice allow, move and collect, continually weigh up the value of the special tokens and when best to use them. Simple but decent fun, with enough decisions along the way to keep the interest up.

Ok game for some occasional fun with nice Basari-type gems, cool dice chute and a nice board. I seem to rate all my games with ‘dragon’ in the title a 6. Do publishers say, here’s an ok game that’s not quite great; if we dress it up with a dragon theme, people will be more attracted to it than the actual play is worth?

It's hard to rate these family games the same as you might with your own gaming crowd. I'll call it 6.5, because I'd rate it about a 5.5 with gaming friends and a 7.5 with my family.

Edit: I'd not play this with gaming friends at all. It just doesn't appeal. Not a bad game, just not that interesting.

Okay treasure hunting game that I've only played once.  Very Knizia-esque, with lots of little hitches required along the way to keep the game from being too easy or boring.  Gets lost in the shuffle of so many other good games.

RATING: 7
Couple of plays: A fun game for two players.  A roll and move game but it doesn't feel like one thanks to the non-standard dice that you assign to your pawns after rolling them in a dice tower.  Cool.  Interesting end game scoring as well.

RATING: 7
Roll and move done right. Enough things to do to warrant the time spent playing. In the end, a very abstract game.

This is currently my kids' favorite game (ages 5 and 7).  I am astonished by this, because the game takes us an hour or so to play, much longer than I would expect their attention span to be.  So somehow the theme and objective really capture their imagination and hold their interest.  So I'd say this makes a wonderful bridge for kids who are ready to move from typical children games to more lengthy, complex adult games.  My rating is for the game as a game to play with kids.  I wouldn't have any interest in playing it with other adults.

This is an excellent gamers strategy game, which is also a good family game.

Maybe marked down by family gamers because it is too easy to not get a full set of magic rings, which could put off some younger players.

But this is a gem of a gamers game, and it has the added bonus of having a good dice tower - useful for many, many games.

Knizia does a roll and move game using the scoring element from Tigris and Euprates.  Dragonland is quite fun, mainly due to the special power tokens and being able to use the dragons to fly around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an intriguing question - how do I rate an adult strategic game that is wrapped in kid-friendly, roll-and-move mechanics?
Make no mistake - this is a Knizia strategic game first and foremost (Alan Kwan's article is spot-on). The colorful components and dragon theme superficially obscure the mathy mechanics. But who wins will be decided primarily be who optimizes their moves for treasure-collection.
There are 2 approaches you can take to Dragonland - as an adult game, it could be a serious session if they could look past the kiddy theme.
For kids, it could be a light, fun race/collection game if they can get past the mathy-ness.
Unfortunately, I fear Dragonland will usually fail at both approaches, since kids/adults will focus on what doesn't fit them as opposed to what does.
It is similar to Elfenland in that respect, where the strategy leaves the kids cold and the theme leaves the adults perplexed.

Tricky rules:
* After placing the 1st companion, the 2nd and 3rd are only entered on subsequent moves. (In other words, you don't place companions 2 and 3 during the 1st move)
* Companions can [b]only[/b] pick up gems of their color. We played the 1st time where they were allowed to pick up all gems, but could pick up all gems of their color.
* Game ends when all eggs are gone (not gems).

Like another reviewer mentioned, I can&#039;t believe the negative reviews this game has received.  I was relunctant to pick this one up but being a Knizia collector I bought it anyway.  I&#039;ve been pleasantly surprised.  My gaming group has enjoyed this game.  Lots of tough decisions and one of the few games I have which has you thinking of long term strategies depending on the initial board layout.  The only negative would be it seems to last a little too long but this might change with more playings.  The components and board are really nice.  Everyone has loved getting to use the dice tower!

Billed as a "family game", meaning it's good to play with your kids. A bit light for sustained adult attention, but it definitely has its charms, and it has the distinctive Knizia trade-off dilemmas. The box includes a foldable plastic-and-cardboard dice tower billed as the "Tower of Destiny", a phrase I can never read without imagining it intoned dramatically by a basso announcer with plenty of echo.

Very nice Euro in which players try to optimize their moves in order to get the most valuable combination of gems and dragon eggs to get points at the end, with a typical Knizia scoring system, but this time less convulated than usual.

RATING: 5
Well, add me to the list of fans! I like this game because it executes a roll and move mechanic with success, and I suppose I'm nostalgic about roll and move. But that's the least of why it's a great game. Every turn, I find myself wanting to do more than I actually can. So far, with 2, 3, and 4 players, this game has managed to maintain very good tension throughout. There are really two reasons for this. 1. As mentioned, you just cannot do all you would like. 2. Unless you have a photographic memory and pay close attention to your opponents, you may not know who is "in the lead", because the items you collect for points are hidden behind a screen. In Drachenland, each player moves three companions (an elf, a human, and a dwarf - I think) amongst a landscape dotted with volcanoes. Each player has a blue, red, and green companion - and only the proper companion can collect sapphires (blue), rubies (red), and emeralds (green). Anyone can collect dragon eggs. All these things reside in volcanoes. The most points are awarded for complete sets, that is one egg, and one of each gemstone. BUT, for a given kind of gem to count, the corresponding companion must also obtain a magic ring. So there is a race to get these rings before the game ends (when all the eggs have been collected). There are a few different viable strategies to win, involving opponent denial, etc., that I will not detail but only mention in passing (hey, I just did that!).

CHILDREN'S RATING: 9

I call this game "Tigris and Euphrates for kids", primarily because of the scoring mechanism (which is surprisingly similar), but also because Drachenland is classic Knizia. If you have a budding strategy gamer child, like I do, this game is AWESOME. I have not heard another request for Enchanted Forest since Drachenland arrived in the house (not that EF is terrible or anything - I just enjoy Drachenland much more). The game really draws kids in with the (ahem) rolling of "destiny cubes" - and the "tower of destiny" likewise adds flavor and fun to rolling them! You get to collect dragon eggs and little gems, both of which are irresistible little toys. Sometimes, if you roll a 4, you get to fly to a different volcano on the back of a dragon. What could be better? But keep in mind that all this good stuff is trapping. The base game is a Knizia - I'm sure there's a mathematical algorithm (or many) resting under there somewhere. So while this game may not appeal to the Candyland crowd of rollers-and-movers, if you are a European boardgamer, and your kid(s) like some of your games, this one is worth a shot.

This is a great light racing game with some tough logistical choices mixed with a classically screwy Knizia scoring system.  Just because this is simple doesn't mean that ther isn't anything to it.  I always found myself wanting to do more each turn, but felt like I still could work toward something worthwhile.

This certainly isn't a must have game, but I rather like it and find it one of the more intriging Knizia games.

My 8 year-old loves this game and I find it enjoyable in a mellow sort of way as a 2-player game with her.  I suspect it will be more interesting/challenging with 3 or 4 players because then there's some uncertainty as to who has what and whether you'll win if you end the game.

RATING: 6
A fun roll-and-move game.

The board shows several volcanoes, each with a random mix of preset numbers of gems (red, blue, green, white) and dragon eggs, as well as 1 face down special token (players start with 3 tokens). These are connected to each other by paths of various lengths (1-5, generally) and by rivers. There are 3 entrances to the board, connected by paths to 2 volcanoes each. Players have 3 pawns (red, blue, green). Initially, in turn order, them move 1 pawn into the Dragon Land: player 1 goes 1 step, 2 goes 2, etc. Then take turns. On your turn you roll 2 d6 (numbered 1-2-2-3-3-3 and 2-3-3-4-4-4) in the really cool cardboard dice tower (Tower of Fate). You assign 1 die to each of 2 of your pawns. They move according to the die roll, along the paths. If they enter a volcano with a face down token, movement ends and the token is flipped face up. The pawn that moved may then take either all the gems of their own color, 1 white (diamond), 1 egg and the special token (if present), or if the special token is one of the Ring Tokens, they may put a ring (rubber band; 1/pawn max) on the pawn. They may also use their special tokens, which do a variety of things: allow movement on a river, add 3 to movement limit, summon a dragon to your location, use the 4 you rolled on the d6 to fly on a dragon (must be present) to any other volcano, take treasure twice, reroll the 2d6. Keep playing till the last dragon egg is removed from the board. Before scoring, discard any gems for which the like-colored pawn does not have a ring! Then, each set of red-blue-green-egg (white may be used as a wild gem) is worth 10 points; gems/eggs not in sets are worth 1pt each. Most points wins!
Yes, it's a roll-and-move game. But it plays quickly, the dice rolls aren't totally random (limited ranges of numbers), you have 3 pawns to move so can usually use whatever numbers you roll pretty well, there are some strategic/tactical decisions to make, and it's pretty fun! Similar feel to Verflixxt!, I think.

RATING: 3
Seems like a game that could be compressed into a much shorter card game, just the type its author is famous for.  It doesn't offer the usual Knizia difficult decisions on every turn.  Also, because of the different dice, you're usually moving just a couple spaces every turn, which seems a bit monotonous to me and lengthens the game.  Pass.

RATING: 7
This has a theme that might indicate a kids' game, or at least a family game.  But it plays well with our cutthroat group as well.  It definitely rewards strategies based on the gem starting positions, and you'd do well to consider the first few possible moves.  This, thankfully, plays in the right amount of time.  So many of Knizia's more recent light strategy games are simply not long enough for any long range planning, so this was a nice change of pace.  

Player controlled game-end is something I like in many games, and this one has a great mechanic there since you also want game-ending-rings for scoring...but you may not want to take one when it gets near the last few unless your comfortable in your position.

All in all, pretty decent and worth hanging on to for several more plays...by that time it may be played out, but that'll be a couple years off.

RATING: 8
Great family game. Roll-and-move does not have to equal boring, and this game proves that. There are interesting decisions to be made every turn, both in the movement and especially in the collecting of sets.

While there is plenty of strategy to satisfy adults, the game is very accessible to kids as well (probably ages 7 or 8 and up).

RATING: 6.5
[Ravensburger 'Drachenland' 2002 edition] {Fantasy, treasure hunt; roll-and-move, set collection, utility cards; optimal 4p} A good family game. Nice player interaction with some confrontation.  It has a strong theme (adventuring in a fantasy land to collect treasures) and it progresses very smoothly. Player interaction is strong; players have to complete for eggs, gems, disks throughout the game. Thus, it is tight till the end of the game.

Dragonland has a certain degree of strategy. Although it involves dice, luck is not as strong as most people think.  It's crucial to collect both eggs and white gem; esp. in 2-3p games.

We created a house rule for team play for 4 players and it's quite funny :laugh:

Played once with 3-players (my 6- and 7-year old boys). There are some tactical options in this easy playing game, but the game is not that challenging or interesting. The components are so-so and the game play is very plain. The special powers spice up the game though, bringing the game to a slightly higher level. The game is easy enough that kids can play (not necessarily well). Theme is a good one for kids, but it is thinly pasted on.

Dragonland is all about the production values.  The box and board are gorgeous, the dice tower is a rare treat, and the pieces are solid and varied.  The game itself is a quandary; too complex for most children and WAAAY too simple for adults.  If Knizia made a roll-and-move, it would be this.  He did, so it is, and Dragonland isn't very good.

Very flexible game in that it scales well from 2-4, is fun for younger kids and adults, and it works for gamers and non-gamers.

Solid game with very nice components and I think it was a neat touch that it includes a dice tower.

I wish I could come up with something insightful about this game. Let's see... I think the Knizia scoring twist makes this harder for kids and therefore Dragonland doesn't rest easily as it should in that zone. I guess I am not inspired.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Like the game quite a bit. Essentially a lightish set collection game. It also comes with a dice tower that I use for other games!! I also use the Dragons from blue moon or blue moon city, it adds to the flavor. 

A largely tactical game, involves some special powers, dice to control movement and set collection. 

The important decisions are largely related to the timing of using your special powers to grab items for your sets. Grabbing items before other people is also part of the timing. Finally, the game end (which is under player control) also needs to be timed correctly

Despite my low rating, Dragonland is actually a somewhat clever set collection game that uses the roll and move mechanic.  Make no mistake that I do think there are plenty of meaningful decisions one has to make, however, I do not care for the means by which the pieces are moved around the board to achieve the goal.  I would definitely recommend this as a family and children's title, but with other adults we really should be playing something heavier.

Some neat stuff going on in this "roll and move" game.  The quotes are used for sarcasm, of course...since you don't need to move as much as what you rolled, and there are other ways to move around the board.  Some interesting things going on with choices of what to take...go for eggs with their tokens, or gems?  Also cool how you can see the game coming to a close in advance and plan accordingly.  I think people on BGG are a bit stodgy at times.  They need to lighten up.

This game isn't difficult but I enjoy it for what it is.  Bonus points for very attractive components and SHINY gems! I enjoyed it with 3 more than as a 2-player.

It is a rather pleasant diversion, deciding which things you want to collect in order to satisfy some classic Knizia scoring incentives.

RATING: 9
Maybe your kids won't recall Ivor with the hazy nostalgia you do, but that's no reason not to induct them into his whimsical world. The involvement of original artist Peter Firmin only makes that journey all the more authentic and irresistible.

Ivor is a genuinely charming, lovingly crafted, and delightfully packaged family game. There is nothing here not to love!

RATING: 6
I like Peter Firmin’s classic and timeless artwork; however, in the context of this game, and in conjunction with the hideous hexagonal(ish) overlay, it is actually rather confusing.

For instance, I kept trying to move from Post Office Crossing to Dyffryn Bridge because there appears to be a path between them and Ivor’s Shed is a dead end, despite having paths leading out of it through three (illegal) hexsides.

The game would be much better without the hexgrid overlay. Hexgrids are an excellent tool when you need the ability to show movement in 6 different directions, but out of the 20 spaces in this game, 14 only allow movement in 1 or 2 directions. Movement in 4 or more directions is only possible from 2 spaces and one of those is the result of another confusing distortion into a double-hexagon.

Also, is the journey from Llanmad to Mrs Porty’s House a move of 2 or 4 spaces? In other words, is it necessary to enter (and reverse out of) Smoke Hill?

The game components are fine, except for the rectangular cardboard chits representing each player’s wagon. I like the sheeples, and would have also liked a larger version instead of the white squares.

I would suggest that it is not challenging enough for the hardened gamer, and with a 7 page rulebook, neither is it for kids, thereby excluding what I would have thought would be the two main target markets for a game of this sort.

Overall I enjoyed the game rather more than one of the other players, who has previously submitted a less-than-enthusiastic comment.

Benefitted from lovely artwork by Peter Firmin.  Disliked the random negative penalties - loose 2 sheep.  Then other getting gain 3 sheep…  Would have preferred all positive events.  Spent first two thirds of game in Grumbly Gasworks and Tan-y-Gwich hexes, but still sneaked a win (but maybe facts were related).  Found a little frustrating, but also slightly engaging.

No game has given me this much pleasure before I have even read the rulebook, let alone played it.

It required Father's Day to obtain the goodwill from my wife (a zealous non gamer) to play this with my 8 year old daughter.

The game just oozes the character of the TV series and the books. Cards are snap shots from the Small Films stories that latch onto the game mechanism. There is a sizable slice of luck doled out by the cards but you can introduce screwage if you are that way inclined. For once I don't think its within the spirit of the game. Oliver P would not have approved.

To be honest I wasn't really concerned about collecting sheep, I was more than happy to chuff around the board and smile at the cards. Not surprisingly the youngest player won by a country mile and really enjoyed it. I'd happily play with her again, however my wife will need to finish therapy first.

Not sure who the target audience for this game is - it appears family friendly, but the take that card element isn't (or maybe some families like that kind of thing?).

Not enough here for gamers (or the people I game with anyway), and the cards have too much text.

Overall worth a look if you like the TV show.

A very nice game about travelling to different locations and collecting sheep, in competition with the other players.
Every home should have this game! The published game has excellent components (including Sheeples!), and beautiful thematic art from Ivor's original artist, Peter Firmin. An absorbing game that provides a competitive game for experienced gamers, and simple enough to introduce younger gamers to more advanced elements of gaming beyond 'roll and move' type games.

I played 1 game of this and this is what i thought, the graphics of the board are bad and not very clear. the sheep component are good but the wooden white square to indicate for a flock of 5 sheep could of being a large wooden sheep or some thing better. and the player counter piece could of been a wooden train not a piece of cardboard. and then there a was the sudden finish as a player collected 25 sheep and won, and he rest of us were left wondering how? when we all felt we had only just got going and not got into it at all. This could of been produce better and would of been a better for the games feel and flavour but then i think it could been slightly broken with a runner away leaders. 
it is aim at families and young kids but i won't be playing it again or showing it to my family.

When I browsed through the (great) Essen Preview, this game immediately caught my eye. I couldn't resist spending some time helping out Ivor to retrieve lost sheeps in the gorgeously depicted welsh countryside.

Turns out that the game is not only cute but also very good. It is simple and familial but fun to play between grown ups. You can plannify your moves a few turns ahead but this strategic aspect is counterbalanced by frequent "in your face" powers of some cards.

All in all Ivor the Engine is probably one of the very good surprises of Essen Spiel '14 !

Tight scores - short game - good stuff.  Need to play again to figure out whether certain cards are just too good to use as deliveries, esp. if there are 3 or 4 sheep on the location.  I love the rule that you have to clear the sheep to make the delivery - that rule makes the game.

Willing to try again, but alas appears to be too much "take that". This seems an inappropriate introduction to German-style game (though the graphics mislead to that conclusion -- nice art, but a little hard for the players looking at the map upside-down to find the locations); it's much more in the Anglo-American school.

Ivor the Engine hits the sweet spot between family and strategy games. Such a balance requires a delicate touch, and may not immediately be appreciated by the gamer group. Like many simple games, depth emerges from the strategic interaction among players.

The combination of mechanics is in many ways unique. The board setup populates locations with sheep. Sheep are the victory points in the game. You collect sheep by beginning your move in their location and a bonus is rewarded for collecting the last one from a location.

Collecting sheep will appeal to family gamers. 

However, more depth emerges with the job and event cards, which are refilled to a line of 4 at the end of each player turn. A single card must selected at the end of your turn. Job cards are free, event cards cost gold. 

Job cards are satisfied by moving to a location that is empty of sheep. The job cards can also be used for special actions, instead of completing them, often providing for increased player interaction or rules modification. Collect too many job cards and you must discard down to 4 and lose some sheep.

Job cards once completed can grant sheep, coal, or gold (that can be used at anytime to buy coal), and coal allows for extra moves beyond 1 per turn. Ah, the clockworks begin to become more interesting now, eh?

Event cards that are thematic to the story also appear in the job card line and cause and immediate effect upon the game, which varies from card to card. They may also be purchased with gold for an end game scoring bonus.

The final game round occurs when one player reaches a minimum number of sheep collected, which varies upon the number of players. Bonuses are totaled up and the player with the most sheep wins the game! Ties are broken by number of jobs completed.

This is a fun game with enough randomness introduced by the job and event cards to reward gamers who are strategically flexible, not unlike Snowdonia, the designer's previous hit game. The rules are simple enough to be accessible by family gamers, while providing a rich story book theme. All in all a splendid effort, worthy of any collection.

Quirky game which is sold in best British understatement as a kid’s game for adults. Actual gameplay is as odd as this sounds but at the same time has its charms. While heavily frontloaded as a pickup-and-deliver game with the typical need to map out a route in advance, it has a high degree of randomness and player targeting at the same time. Definitely too involved for kids.

The first thing I did was buy a resin Ivor the Engine figure to use as a first player marker.  It is sweet!

There is more strategy than you expect.  Definitely not a kids game.  Also, a lot of luck as to what cards come up at what time.  Some of the event cards swing the game in random ways.  You could ignore the event itself and just use the card in the card row as a card to be purchased for end points.

ivor the engine is a decent filler that isn't as family friendly as it looks.

you can pick a player of your choice to skip a turn or have a round without scoring.
because of that turn order is pretty important and perhaps even too much. i had a useless card left i picked it in the second to last round so people couldn't play it on me with a combo. 
when it was my turn there was only one person left to play it too. it made a difference of ten points to him.
given that the game is over when one player has reached 25 points that is very cruel. he wouldnt have won, i did :) but he would have been second.

my use for this is to play with non gamers and i put it right next to my collectors edition of takenoko.

RATING: 5
The board consists of large hexagons linked by a single track railway each with a village or town name, a random number of sheep (which are victory points) are placed into each area of 1 or 2 hexagons. There is a deck of cards which can be used either as an action or as a victory point card. On your turn you have 4 phases. 1. Pick a sheep up off the board where you are located. 2. Move 1 space for free (pay coal to move more) play any number of action cards from your hand to use the actions or to claim victory points for a village or town reached (the latter only if the target area is free of sheep). 3. Take a replacement card from one of 4 on display. 4. Replace that card from the draw pile possibly triggering an event.
So how does it play - the mechanics are smooth and intermesh quite nicely and a game turn is quite simple to play-out, so yes it is easy to learn (despite 7 pages of rules)  however I found  the play to be quite  pedestrian, pick up a sheep in an area for which you have a delivery card, possibly play an action card or two, pick up a card from the row. Pre-planning can be done to a certain extent - but only seems to consist of - collect more delivery cards for yours or a nearby area or pick an action card to boost your sheep or gold. Random event cards may hamper or help but on the whole I felt it was a game of "who got the right cards at the right time" i.e. luck of the draw.
There is more to the game than described above, but that is basically the guts of the game. 
I played a dummy game on my own to learn the rules and then a 3 player game. On the whole as a gamer I felt disappointed. It has the same designer as Snowdonia, it has an Ivor the Engine tie-in and Esdevium are involved - in all 3 big names and yet the game is quite pedestrian (unless I have missed something). The rules are 7 pages long mostly small print so I was thinking (and hoping) for a Snowdonia plus, something more polished, perhaps less complex (after all it is Ivor the Engine), and something with a bit more "fun".  The game sadly did not hit my expectations, it is aimed at the family market and the gamer in me did not cope well with that.
There were 2 other players in the game and I would be remiss if I did not mention that their view of the game was more upbeat than mine and they enjoyed it. 
I will be playing it again and am willing to reassess my views after more plays, this is after all based on only one game and I was viewing it through the eyes of a long-time gamer.

Otherwise nicely done pick-up-and-deliver game, but two issues which I didn't like: 1) annoying map (graphically ok, but confucing routes) 2) a lot of text on cards which slows otherwise such a simple game. The rest is okay: enough take that and blocking opportunities + luck. And the theme is superb!

This was a bit costly and a game based on an original B&W TV cartoon is not auspicious. Had it not been for Eric Martin putting a very long post in from Tony Boydell's experience with getting the original artist to do the artwork for ItE.

One 4P game and we all had fun. A lot of choices - cards used as jobs paying off in Sheep or for the card action. An ability to perform an appropriate level of screwage is present but no overwhelming. One must be careful about running over the goal near the end especially if 1st player as all the other will have their go at being the actual first... 

It wasn't overly complex and took us about a hour+ with rules.

Onfirst play with 3 I thought tht there was an issue with having multiple jobs for the same location, blocking everyone esle out and just sitting there cashing in the sheep.

On second play I realised that htere is quite a lot of ways of messing with the other players - especially runaway sheep. 

All in all I like this. Cute theme, more Idris action would have been nice !

A very quick game of sheep collection. Family-friendly and rather heavily influenced by lucky card draws but also comes with lots of opportunities for nasty card play, so works for gamers as well.

Even though the map is thematically correct, navigation is needlessly complex regardless. The flat counters as player markers are the other usability issue here but they can be easily replaced.

Earns an extra point for the amazing feat of getting Peter Firmin back on the (iron) horse before it's too late.

Altro gioco dell'autore di Snowdonia. Il gioco secondo me ha una grafica molto simpatica anche se il tabellone per le prime partite potrebbe risultare un po' confuso. Il gioco comunque scorre via che è un piacere e l'idea di fondo è molto simpatica (con il trasporto delle pecore). Forte anche l'interazione, ma l'uscita delle carte risulta troppo determinante e casuale da determinare spesso la vittoria. Gioco quindi simpatico ma non decisamente nelle mie corde.

Third in the Boydell 'train games that aren't train games' trilogy, Ivor is a glorious romp of childhood nostalgia and pitch-perfect artwork. Those that criticise the shortfalls of the game beneath (some card-balance problems; Tony's susceptibility for 'use them for this action or keep them for VPs' cards; a general lack of long-term control) have absolutely missed the point. The game oozes charm and character, and it has sheep for VPs! What's not to like there?

[i]I've only played Ivor one time and would definitely be willing to play again since it was a very quick and fun experience. There is some player interaction since you can mess with what your opponents are trying to do through the card play, but the game is very light so it's quite easy to pick up and play. Overall I had fun playing, but there isn't much weight to the decisions you make, I could see this being a great gateway family game as long as you don't mind a bit of take that in your games.[/i]

Am a fan of the cartoon but I found this game underwhelming. The scribbly map has a confusing hex overlay, the place names are hard to locate on the map plus the cards are difficult to read from the other side of the board. I liked the thematic sheep tokens but then it switches to abstract squares to represent five sheep. Despite nostalgia for the cartoon I can't imagine wanting to play this again.

RATING: 7
It's a family questing game, fulfilling jobs to earn sheep, most sheep wins. It plays short and the player who's lucky enough to have cards appear in the draft that have jobs that can be done at the site he already is (or close by) is likely the winner, so luck is a big factor. Jobs are basically just about being in a place that's been cleared of sheep. Cards that you can't use for jobs can be used for their special action instead which are a nice compensation (and generally leader hitting or loser gaining) but not game winning. Turns are to clear one sheep from the board, maybe play a job or jobs or actions, and pick up a new card. Straightforward, fast enough, and clearly a step up from Walmart games towards Euro-ville. And it's hard not to like games that have quests/jobs in it, even if it is short and over-luck-bound.

An IP that I have loved for over 40 years, I was happy to pick up Ivor the Engine and hold onto it until my son grew old enough to play rather than toy with it. At six, he easily grasped the rules but not yet the strategy or tactics, both of which exist but are quirky. There are almost two distinct stages to the game, enforced by the rule which says that a location must be cleared of wandering sheep before jobs can be completed there. This leads to some odd shuffling back and forth between locations to clear them out, especially if you hold one or two job cards for adjacent locations. Played with just three, this has meant very little interaction and I can see why two players was not put on the box. The game allows players to be quite mean: having your route blocked means a slow, lengthy detour.
Overall, I enjoyed playing the game, but it feels more gamer-y than family-y than I expected (to be fair, because I liked the IP, this was picked up without reading reviews). There’s definitely a game here, but I can understand families house ruling aspects of it to suit their own style.

What I call a classic SdJ game, in that for families you can play a friendly game in which you can play moves that will help other players without appearing to patronise them (important when playing with children) but for gamers this can be full-on brutality once you understand the subtleties of the card interactions and the board.
And then you get a gorgeous board, wonderful cards and a lovely rulebook.  What's not to love here?

Despite my age (& nationality) I don't think I've ever watched the old TV series. I wonder about the theme - targeted at middle-aged British men, and from the age (8+) presumably to play with younger family members.

The snag is that gameplay is a bit brutal & random. You can really screw over other players.

I'd like to try it a few more times, though.

I really like [person=1086][/person]. [thing=119432][/thing] is excellent and he is a fun guy to hang out with or play games with, so naturally this had to be on my list. Being not from the UK I wasn't familiar with Ivor theme. I was aware that this wouldn't be Snowdonia 2, but more of a family game. And it is. There is a healthy but not problematic amount of luck with the cards that come out. There is some strategy in which cards you take and how you move on the board. You can play nice or slightly nasty. It actually kind of reminded me of last year's [thing=137095][/thing] because of the weight and you are also running around trying to perform jobs. But I think this might be a slightly better game. It's not a game I will play tonnes of, but it's a nice to game to play every now and then when you're too tired for a heavy game.

I remain convinced that there is some hidden depth here, but my fellow players were unconvinced. Played at Essen 2015.

Simple, pick-up-and-deliver (sort of) game. Cards with lots of, essential, but impossible to read across the table, text. Weird (Welsh), hard to find location names on the map. Not really worth the effort.

Churdicoff, Churdicoff, toot toot. Rarely watched the series as a kid but I love this pick up and drop game.

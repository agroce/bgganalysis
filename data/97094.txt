Fair area majority game with dice.  It had some neat ideas, but I was pummeled for having a few bad rolls.  Luck was too important.  There was no way to mitigate that (at least in the base game).  Didn't really detect any leveling (catch-up) mechanics.

Finally played this. It's a tight dice allocation game with interesting decisions. Provides a refreshing alternative to the Yahtzee mechanism so common in other dice games. Haven't tried the advanced game yet.

RATING: 6
The lack of theme really takes away from a simple fun game. We tend to say that we 'buy' a city instead of 'conquering' it; I put a piece of masking tape over the title and wrote "Dark Realestate" because it feels much more like that sometimes. 
To bring some colour to it, we got to name each city we 'bought' and I made a small variable where you get extra points for 'buying' specific cities. Added a lot more strategy. 
Granted i got this for 5US, I'm happy i got it.

A pretty good dice game, probably better with more than 3 players. Turn order can screw some people over, and going third often gives you a big advantage over going second. As others have mentioned, the game could be improved by being a bit shorter, and I don't think levelling up is necessarily the best strategy. The special cards in the "advanced" game are a must to make the game more interesting, even in your first play.

RATING: 4
Sigh. Another half-assed, clearly unfinished game. There are interesting ideas here, but it is easily twice as long to play for the interest level on offer. Clever mechanics which add up to nothing - very repetitive, lacking drama, no narrative flow, little tension. A shame, this could have been something, but I'll be avoiding originals from Z-Man in future.

Initial rating, may change.

-Not normally a big rulebook critic, but this one is unclear on many important points. You have to read the BGG forum to play the game.

-I like the dice allocation mechanic, but I don't feel there's enough development here. Everybody is basically doing the same thing, and you're doing the same thing on turn ten you did on turn one, only with slightly better dice. The point-trigger game end seems arbitrary, and playing through the whole stack makes it too long. 

-Overlords were a good idea, but there aren't enough of them and many of the ones included are a bit random and backstabby.

This and King Of Tokyo are Kevin's games, and he was right when he thought I would like this dice game better.  As he points out, it has a little more strategy and plays a little like Alea Iacta Est (which he knows I like) where there are choices for dice allocation. 

Easy set up, easy to teach, easy to learn & play, and put away.  

Graphics could have been more interesting. Consistent bad throws of the dice can lose the game.  The graveyard is an interesting feature.  There are several approaches to leveling up and gaining points. Yes, I want this one too.

This game is a bit under rated IMO. Basically it's a worker placment, management type of game, where players are trying to conquer more castles and towers, than their opponents.

There's a basic game and an advanced version available in the rule book. Both of which are pretty simple to learn/teach. The game plays in a decent amount of time and didn't overstay it's welcome.

The components are nothing to rave about, but they suit the purpose and work well with the game.

This is a fun one, that I'm glad I got to play.

Many thanks to my good friend Wes, for introducing me to this game.

I like the theme, reminds me of Chaos in the Old World. You are all very evil people in this game. Sadly, the game is sooooo drab. The box, the rules are all from the Hermagor school of drab design. I like the look of the tiles and the skull iconography, but I can't help but think that the graphic design isn't helping the game any. Still looking forward to playing it.

Caveat: we played a 3-player game and got rules horrifically wrong, so our gameplay was not ideal at all to warrant a rating. The rules unfortunately weren't very clear to us, though they were concise.

The components are top-notch, as per Z-Man standards. The theme is a lot of fun also: players score Vanquish Points by overrunning towns and towers with their legion of 50 minions. Resources are allocated by rolling custom dice and applying results to towns (which score VP to the majority player when overrun) or towers (of which a set of three allows players to "level up" and add more or better percentage dice).

As stated in BGG forums on the additional FAQ, be sure to note the following:

1) You can ONLY commit ONE die towards a town per turn. [So you can commit three different dice, one towards each town, for example but not a 2nd die at any one town per turn.]

2) You may modify any one die with the white die, when applicable.

2a) You MUST modify any one die with the yellow die, when applicable. 

3) You can ONLY take ONE tower from ONE town per turn. [So you can commit three different dice, one towards a tower in each town, but not a 2nd die towards a 2nd tower in the same town per turn].

I'll update this rating once I've played this game again, with the correct rules.

After a recent play, I realize just how much luck can cascade into a snowball winning effect.  Also, playing with the static 30/40/50 point ending rule makes for some bizarre timing on who can steal a win in secret.  I find myself liking this game a little bit less each time I play it.

At least it sets up pretty quickly, is easy to teach and understand, and plays relatively quickly.

The dynamics of focusing on both VPs and leveling up your dice blend in really well with the limited minion count.  It keeps you from overstretching, and people who roll really well are slightly punished by running out of minions more quickly.

The graveyard is interesting, and I really like the implementation of the white die as an optional roll.  It's a risky move, since if you fail to roll a skull, you get a marginal +1 or +2 to another die, but can be really rewarding if you can pull 10 minions out for one die.

I haven't yet tried the overlords, but I anticipate that they'll add another strategic element that augments the base game very well.  Maybe this will bring it back up to a 9 or even 10 for me.

You don't feel the theme but the mechanics are as fun as they sound. Plays terribly with 5 people. Not tried with 4 but really only want to play it with 3 now. 3 players has the perfect level of control and randomness and intensity between players. I usually dislike euros but this is fantastic. Really simple and nice and satisfying/rewarding mechanics.

This was better than I thought it would be. You roll dice to attack towns, towers, or get guys out of the graveyard. Attacking towns gets you points and possibly skulls which are used to also resurrect your dead. The towers allow you to upgrade your dice rolling capability when you acquire a full set. Which gets you access to better dice (leveling up). You also get more points for doing so.

There are overlord baddies that you can recruit that give you one shot powers, or ones that stick around but have a round by round upkeep cost where your guys stand with them until you decide against paying the upkeep cost and they come back to your supply instead of the graveyard. There are some interesting ones to manipulate dice, get guys out of the graveyard, mess with other players, and so on.

There is a bit of a calculated risk with the dice in how you place your peeps out on the towns. You don't want to commit too many if you ultimately lose because they will all wind up dead when the city is sacked. You still get credit for 2nd place, so it's still worth a shot, ala El Grande.

For some reason it took a 3 player game a very long time. Closer to 2 hours. Not sure why, but it took forever to get to 50 points. The towns in the final part of the stack awarded many more points so it accelerated more quickly. Will play it again.

Based on the (poorly written) rules Dark Minions sounds quite interesting and indeed it does have some nice ideas. Unfortunately though in practice the game feeld under developed: it starts slow and then lasts way too long, some mechanisms are just odd (and not in a good way), end game is problematic and the artwork is unfunctional.

None of Dark Minion's faults are big individually, but together they kill the game.

It sounded much more interesting than actually it was. Some similatiries to many dice games, but something new too. Unfortunately it is too long, repetitive and is missing hard choices.

A fun little dice game that really could have used better production overall. The game reminds me a lot of Smash Up without the theme and flavor. You assign minions to a base until it "explodes," and everyone who has minions there gets points. There are also towers you take over to level up, which gives the game an artificial form of progression, but I didn't mind it so much here because it didn't feel vital to go this route. I also think the Overlord Cards are necessary to inject a good amount of theme into the game. About my only complaint of the game besides the blah components is the length. This should be a 30-minute game at most, and it can last anywhere between 45 minutes and an hour. It's not that big of a deal, but I just wish the game was slightly shorter. Overall I'm very happy with this game. It may not have as much flavor as I would have liked, but it works well as a solid dice game.

I love dice games, and I believe this one works quite well. I have only played the base game as a 3 player though and believe the advanced rules would add a lot. 

Placing your minions to try and take over areas, based on your die rolls, is an interesting concept. You must balance if you want to try to dominate an area, go for a tower (to eventually level up) or recover so of your lost minions in the graveyard. The scoring is hidden, so it can be difficult to see who is in the lead. The advanced rules add cards which you can use die rolls to acquire and give you special powers.

Interesting, but ultimately a dice rolling contest.  If you consistently roll better than your opponents, you will win.  There are some nice decisions on how you should assign your dice, and when to try to improve your dice versus go for VPs.  If you're not getting screwed or facing someone with great luck, then it's an interesting game.  The dice luck kind of overrides the strategy, though.  I haven't played with the Overlords, so maybe that would mix things up a bit.

A good demonstration of a long list of novice game design mistakes.  All are understandable in a designer, but none are forgivable in a game.
 - area majority with no meaningful second place (and a huge benefit for fist)
 - bidding on area majority in a way that basically amounts to a penny auction (first place get skull tokens that recover their investment, while others lose their investments)
 - dice game where rolling higher is simply strictly always better (except for the +1 effect, which is interesting...but a 2 is just BAD).
 - tremendous snowballing without any mitigation except a faint "well, you should probably gang up on the leader" excuse that doesn't even hold since it's hard to do so
 - ambiguous timing effects and formalism gaps that require player adjudication

All that said, there were some charming elements.
 - deciding when to roll a white die (small +s) instead of a regular die (large non-combinable #s)
 - deciding when to take a special power monster vs. tower vs. area majority
 - managing the economy of reviving dead vs. investing the living

Were the basic mistakes fixed, the charming elements would triumph and the game might be quite good.  Sadly, a quick attempt on my part (giving 2nd place the skull tokens) did not do enough, so I fear a complete overhaul is needed and I'm not sure it's worth the time.

Rules suggestion:

One of the few games where I feel that the designers QAs have actually made the game worse by flat-out contradicting the rulebook.

Unfortunately, this game suffers from the flaw of many dice-driven games in that higher rolls are better. With a few changes, I think this could have been a great game - as it is, it's an interesting albeit somewhat mediocre game. I'm still tempted to make a few house rules such as:

Make towers require an exact 2-3-4, not 4-5-6. (To make low rolls worth something).

Very decent area majority game, with some individual player powers and leveling-up involved.  I wish the artistic style was more cohesive throughout, the flavor could definitely have benefited from it,  but the game itself is solid.

Sphere's convinced me to get this, as usual.

A fun little dice game with a great theme. I suggest using the longer game variant in the rulebook as the game seemed to end before I knew it! The overlord cards are a nice touch with great artwork. All in all, a fun game!

Not enough interesting decisions. Love the theme though.

My first couple games of this, I was utterly unconvinced.  Turns out we were doing it wrong!  The rules seem to have had a few rough patches, but the designer has been really helpful ironing things out in the forums.  Once you get it right, this is a nice little dice game.

There's lots of dice rolling, so there's obviously a fair amount of luck--rolling high is a good path to victory.  But there are lots of mechanisms in place to help you influence and mitigate this luck, and plenty of interesting decisions.

There are a few different sources of tension in the game.  One is created by minions getting sent to the graveyard when you use them.  You need to get them back out before you can use them again, but any dice you devote to this aren't spent on leveling up or getting points, so you're usually trying to do it opportunistically in your less crucial turns.  You can use skull tokens, earned throughout the game, to get minions back too, which is more efficient and flexible, but these are worth victory points, so the more you hang onto, the better.

Another tension is trying to position yourself to capture towns without gifting them to someone else.  When the point values start getting higher, you need to get minions in a town early to have an opportunity to snag it later, but you also need to avoid setting it up for someone else to swoop in and make your investment irrelevant.

There's definitely some of the Puerto Rico-style significance of seating order.  If one player is constantly putting minions into towns but not capturing them, the player sitting after them is liable to win.  But that's a relatively minor flaw.

Overall, a fun and interesting little game.

It's almost unthinkable that a dice game could be paced so poorly that it provokes alternating emotional bursts of boredom and antipathy - not just in me, but in everyone at the table.  If you want an existence proof, though, here it is.

Between turns, the rapid deceleration of time will play havoc with your self-awareness and basic motor control.  During our last game, the downtime reached geologic proportions, whereby the calcium in my aging skeleton transformed into half-animate metamorphic rock that only a black arts mineralogist could hope to identify.

Thus I have become a living statue doomed forever to sit before an unfinished game of Dark Minions.  And now I spend every minute of every day praying that natural forces will weather away my eyes so that I no longer have to look upon my cruel fate.

A dice game similar to Airships in that you use dice to "buy" other cards and then use the cards to upgrade your dice. The ultimate goal is being 1st or 2nd in conquering towns. It is a little more work than Airships but also has a theme that is more towards the war game side.

It's ok, a little too long to be a great filler for me.

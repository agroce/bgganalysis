I can't help, I love this game, despite the fact that I always score last. It is easy to explain, fast to play, and it has lots of elephants. And you get minus-points for not having a hedgehog in your deck. Whoever created this special rule was, obviously, mad. But nevertheless he had a good taste. Hedgehogs are awesome.

Great art, fairly clear rules (once you get used to it). But:

A) It's a trick-taking game. Generally, I hate trick-taking games. This actually seems a tad better than most, what with the partnership features; BUT:

B) Luck of the draw can sink you from the get-go without any hope.

Nevertheless, if you like trick-taking games, you might like Frank's Zoo. If you don't like them, run away!

I really enjoy this trick taking game.  It has an innovative circular trump... uh... thing that comes together and forks again with land vs sea animals. We had been playing it wrong for years (or I guess really just playing the simplified version). The changing partners adds a good bit of fun into the mix, but for some reason, new players just can't wrap their heads around how it works so well.  Pick up a copy!

RATING: 6
Kind of neat - especially if you have a printed flow chart (in color, even... thank you, Mark Johnson) to help you follow the trick progression.  The coolest feature - pairing off into partnerships after the each round - is also kind of the game biggest drawback.  During the final round(s), the leader(s) is/are often paired up with the player(s) in last place, who now have little insentive to help their &quot;team.&quot;  Yeah, the lions help (they score for the indiviual, not the team), but they&#039;re pretty hard to get, and even then, they&#039;re usually not worth enough points to balance out a lopsided partnership.

my recollection of this game is fairly weak, but after one or two plays the only thing i recall is a fondness for the concept and disappointment with what i found to be a lack of intuitive play.  the symbology sounded great in theory, but several were confused by its depiction of a dominance or food chain.

Certainly one of the most requested games I own. The lions, hedgehogs and partially circular hierarchy of cards adds amazing depth to what is essentially a variant of &quot;asshole&quot;.

Really like the structure of the game with an "intro" first round and then extra scoring, rules and shifting partnerships. The circular rankings of animals makes this game feel fresh and unique.  Not much strategy is clear from the start but rather slowly emerges over several plays.  In my game I was always sitting first or second so never got to be "little" partner and ask for help but think this is an interesting mechanic

This has become a family favorite for some reason. Ladder type game kind of like Tichu, but much more random. The mixed up partnership aspect is fun, but how you help with cards is a little weird. It seems like this would just be an ok game, but there's something about it that our family really likes.

Fun for the end of game evenings, although I prefer 6 Nimmt! or Coloretto.  I like this game better than other Dalumutti style games, because of the strange hierarchy (and the cards even show you when they can be played in a very user-friendly fashion!).  Playing with the strange scoring rules for hedgehogs and lions is a must.

Three plays so far...spaced many moons apart, so need to play a few in a row.

RATING: N/A
In my one play of Frank's Zoo, I didn't see the appeal. I suspect it's because we weren't aware of the scoring for when you exit the game until after the game was over. Still, it's hard to tell how much player decision plays a part in this game. I would try it again under the right circumstances, but I won't seek it out.

Huh.  Wanted to like this.  I get it, but it seemed disjointed.  The lion and hedgehog rules seemed arbitrary.  Mosquito was odd.  Difficult to plan without memorizing the what beats what table.

This game did not work for me or my gaming group at all. We felt we had little control over the game, if you got bad cards there was nothing you could do about it.

March 2014 - another really fun climbing game that plays up to seven.  It has partners but yet you are playing for yourself, as well.  Varying partners which makes it quite cool.

This gets played a lot.  It is not a game for everybody, some players cannot get over the odd scoring rules or the cutesy art.  However, it gets used as a filler when a group is quite large and we don't want to split back up.  It is also a nice game to pull out when you are with non-serious gamers.

Some people think the game has little strategy and a lot of luck.  Sure, some rounds you may be dealt a horrible hand, but overall you should be able to compensate.  If you want to win, count cards.  It may be in your best interest to never play anything until others are almost done, then start playing doubles constantly when they have nothing.

Pure family game gold!  We have had a total blast with this one:  kids, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins -- they all love it.  There is enough luck to give the younger set a shot, but enough strategy to keep adults interested.  Another big plus is the scoring: you earn points based on where you finish, so in, say, a four person game, there is never more than a four point difference between first place and last place per round.  So the young ones don't feel crushed and hopeless if they score low in a given round.  Also, there is little confrontation in the game -- no stealing of cards or purposefully singling specific others out for attack, etc. -- so young tempers don't get frayed.  Finally, the rotating partners play has been a source of much hilarity.  (Imagine a six-year old saying "Oh no, not Grandad again!"). I would strongly recommend using the partners rule; the game got a tepid reaction from players until we graduated from the basic game to partners play. (Note: we don't play the more complicated hedgehog/lion scoring.  I'd love to try but I can't talk anyone into it.  We just use the partner play rules while omitting the special hedgehog/lion scoring rules.)  Oh, one more nice thing about Frank's Zoo:  it handles from 4-7 people.  We've also enjoyed it with 3 (check out the good variants for 3 on BGG) and with 8 people, so it's even more versatile than it claims to be.  Really, it is up there with UNO in terms  of scaleability. 

In short:  Every family with kids aged 6 and up should own this!!!  Along with Bohnanza it is our most beloved family game.  It sees more play than Bohnanza since it is less complicated for our relatives to learn.  (We have played it during every grandparents' visit for the past year and a half, with no sign of getting tired of it.)

2013 UPDATE:  Still going strong.  Still the go-to family game at family events.  Had to get another copy after wearing out the first.  In fact got two copies:  We find that you can play with 8-10 people if you combine two decks.

A nice blend of climbing/shedding mechanics with a little bit of trick-taking mentality. Doesn't have the depth of Tichu, but sometimes you just want something lighter. The shifting partnerships ala Mu are fun and the unique scoring system, while a little fiddly, gives you reason to pay attention. Best with 4-5 players. More than that and it's unlikely you'll get any combinations, thus increasing the playtime, and with three it just wasn't as interesting. Has a tiny bit of a learning curve as the hedgehog/lions scoring rules and the end game scoring rules (two people to 19 what the hell?) tend to confuse people at first.

Not very meaty, but meatier than people seem to think, and a fun introductory game for new or non-gamers.  I like the idea of partnerships, but individual winners.  Adds some weird elements to the partners' respective motives.

RATING: 7
This is a climbing game with a bit of a twist: the animals on the cards can't strictly be ranked in increasing order, because some wimpy animals (the mouse) beat stronger animals (the elephant), many land animals can't beat smaller sea animals, and vice versa.

Also, the junior partner (partner with a lower score) can ask his senior partner for help during tricks.  This can bring in some interesting strategy, because sometimes the senior partner is better off helping the junior partner (i.e. when it helps them both go out faster), but sometimes he isn't (i.e. he's going to go out soon anyway, and/or helping will give the junior partner too many points).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent climbing game that has some circular bits like the big elephant being beaten by the mouse. Less predictable than most climbing games (eg. Tichu). Not sure if that is a bad or good thing. It features shifting partnerships I seem to remember. I need to play this again. I think it will be worth me buying just for Doris' artwork.

RATING: 5
Cute climbing game with an interesting non-linear hierarchy of hands and cool rotating partners. Might go up with more plays. I'd be interested in what happens with a regular group. In the meantime, climbing and trick-taking games are just not the kind of thing that I am eager to play, be it for lack of interest or, more likely, lack of talent.

It's Tichu for kids!  Bare-bones, non-partnered climbing game with an animal theme.  Don't think I'd chose it for myself but I'd happily play it for a while with kids.  I guess we did not play a full game when I played it because it didn't take even 15 mins, nevermind an hour.  Don't think I'd like it as much if it went on that long. *update* my god this game is deeper than I thought when played with just adults ... maybe it'll end up helping me like Tichu.  It does go slightly longer than I'd like, but it's easy enough to play to 11 or 15 or whatever instead of 19.

RATING: 7
Trick taking card game that can be played with partners.  Partnership based on matches between player rankings.  The cards show animals, animals are ranked with some running away from others.  In turn, players must either play the same number of that animal card +1, or that number of cards from a more powerful animal.  The lower ranked partner can ask for help from the senior partner.  Some animals affect points while a mosquito can become an elephant!

It's okay with 2 (no partners) but much better with partners.  With an upper limit of 7, it scales well to be a filler for game days.

RATING: 8
Use the simple (non-partner) rules to teach the game to new players, then step up to the partnership rules which do improve the game.  The cards are cute but they sometimes confuse people who misread them (mistaking the particular animal of a card for one of the animals shown above it).  We think the nonlinear card hierarchy is very clever and makes this game much better than other similar games.  Also the hedgehog/lion extra points are worth using.  The game accommodates a large group (we once played with about a dozen) and seems to be more fun as more players are added.

Acquired February 2008.  First play November 2008.

Easy trick taking game with unique card values that kids can easily understand.  The artwork on the cards allow me to play this with the very young in my family (4 year old) and still have enough challenge for my older kids.

Need to play this one with partners and the advanced scoring rules for lions and hedgehogs.

Good for the kids and non-gamers.  I would prefer something else.

RATING: 7
Components: Beautiful, quality cards. I go back and forth whether I'd prefer the cards to depict the cards they can beat (rather than the cards that can beat them). I lean more toward the former.

Experience: Very fun. Such a simple rule set, but there are opportunities for risk-taking as I decide how best to budget my hand of cards.

The mosquito is an interesting card, and I like how the mice reset the ladder.

After playing sporadically for ten years, I've finally played the full partnership game, and really enjoy it. Trading cards can do a lot to strengthen both partners (though there's no concept of voiding, like in many trick-taking games). The junior asking for help is also clever. The scoring suffers a bit, like in Njet, in that juniors can never overtake their partners in the round the game ends.

This was one of the first Euro's that I bought & an early staple for inflicting on friends before we had children. Not long now before the children will be able to play it themselves so it's likely to have something of a renaissance in our household. I really like the pacing of the game - building up to a killer sequence only to have it ruined by a bunch of mice or mosquitoes. Plenty of laughs & very accessible for non-gamers.

Surprisingly tricky (ha) card game that you can teach to non-gamers very quickly and have fun right away. Like many, my group plays with hedgehogs and lions but not with the partnership rules.

Like most card games, the hand you are dealt can make it very difficult to win the hand, but the problem is mitigated by multiple hands (like most card games).

Our most common game we pull out for non-gamers or people new to the hobby. Easy to explain up front, but the mosquito and the mouse often trip noobies up. Love the art work on the cards and love to count each of the animals as they are played. Start with the easy scoring, but for a more strategic game, definitely go with the lion / hedge hog scoring. Makes for a very good game.

I should like this game. I DO like this game. Its just that I got hammered badly the first time I played with my partners finishing last in every hand. The scoring and partnerships were pretty confusing at first, but the mechanics themselves are simple. The non-linear/obvious sequence of who beats who takes some getting used to as well. Fun and can be played lightly or with serious thought.

Decent game.  I like the two animal tracks (fish and land), the art, and the revolving partner aspect.  But there's something tedious in here, maybe the constant discussion of what-eats-what and how the scoring works.  UPGRADE.  In-game confusion persists but the last play we had was a lot of fun.  UPGRADE.  I forgot how fantastic this is.  The teams make the whole thing.

[2009-10-06 Rating: n.a -> 4]
This rating is based on one play with four experienced players and might change with repeated plays.
I have to admit, that I didn't really have fun while playing this one. This is quite odd, since I really do like trick-taking games normally. But here, I had a lot of problems while figuring out the ranking of the cards. Most of the time, I couldn't evaluate my hand correctly since I couldn't see which cards are good and which aren't. The thing that bothered me the most in this regard is the fact, that each card clearly states by which cards it can be beaten but it doesn't tell you, which other cards it can beat. I'm sure, this problem would diminish with further plays, but somehow I don't know why I should bother with this one when there are easier to grasp trick-taking games with numbered cards where I can clearly see, what beats what.

+ It's a trick taking-game which supports up to six players (incl. a basic partnership-mode) quite well.

- Why didn't they use easier to grasp cards? What bothered me the most is the fact, that the cards don't show which other animals the pictured creature can beat.

Surprising that his clever game is overlooked by the "Heavies" in the industry (Tom V hasn't even reviewed it -- I think if he did, it would claim a spot in the top 100).

Decent ladder-climbing card game that should work well for families.  The food chain concept is well executed, and I like how the mouse can sort of reset the building up by scaring away elephants.   But the scoring is almost too clever for it's own good and I would have prefered a different scoring mechanism.  Also, the partnerships make the game interesting but with an odd number of players, the middle person gets a heavy penalty even though the game attempts to compensate.  On the other hand, it's fun being the middle guy for some reason.

Frank's Zoo is a climbing game with changing partnerships and while it's interesting how the trick-taking works I almost feel that it's too light. Teaching was made easier in that you just teach the trick taking portion in the first round and then in the next round after people understand the trick-taking portion you introduce the partnership and other scoring rules (Lions/Hedgehogs). It seems pretty luck based in that usually someone with a large hand will win a number of tricks in a row until they run out of steam and then the next person with a large hand size will win multiple tricks. This seems to happen until eventually people have approximately the same low number of cards and then people will start going out quickly. At 19 points, it seems like you would only get about 2 rounds of changing partnerships. I guess, you could increase the number of points needed. Then again, 3 hands seems like a the normal length for this sort of game (ie Sticheln & 6 Nimmt).

RATING: 7.5
Animal themed game somewhat similar to the Great Dalmuti, and the classic game President/Chairman.  Animals beat other animals lower in the food chain, and the player who gets rid of their cards first is the winner.  There's also rules for playing in partnerships and for points.  It's less of a social game than the Great Dalmuti (especially when role-playing with hats), since it doesn't have a social hierarchy benefiting winning players, but it's more suitable for children and families.

Best with 4, 5 or 6 - only play at these counts.

There are different ways to play:
- with partnerships (newbies: recommend without partners.  Some people always play without partners and it's fine)
- with lions and hedgehog rules (newbies: recommend without this.  But they can make it more fun, even when playing without partnerships)

Our household rules so far:
- love playing with partnerships, makes scoring go quicker too, and gives different options.  Wouldn't play this way first game though, but introduce it on second round.
- haven't worried about lions/hedgehogs so far.

- Scoring: 
First player out gets points equal to the number of players and on down the line, except for the last player left who always gets zero.

I'm not sure how I feel about this game yet.  At this point, I don't see the depth in this game, but I've been told by a gamer I respect that there's actually a lot here.  On the surface, it appears that all of the decisions are rather obvious, assuming you memorize how the food chain works.  I'm reserving judgment for now.

A mocsárhoz hasonló überelős kártyajáték. Jópofa állatfigurák vannak a kártyákon. Minden állatnak megvan, hogy mely állatok erősebbek nála (ütik). Kicsit kő-papír-olló szerűen körbeverik egymást az állatkák. Lehetőséged van több azonoos állattal is überelni erősebb helyett.

Gyors, partyjáték. Én nem éreztem benne túl sok kombinációs lehetőséges, és valahogy a hangulata se jött át annyira. Ha hasonlő játékra vágyom, akkor inkább a coloretto-t választom.

RATING: 7
Fun trick taking game, and especially good with the full contingent of players.

Small fish, get eaten by big fish, get eaten by crocodiles, get trampled by elephants, run away from mice... what?

It's a ladder climbing game similar to The Great Dalmuti. The main difference is that contrary to that one, Frank's Zoo doesn't further punish the losers. In fact, if played with the teamplay option, it even has a catch-up mechanic.

Based on one game with the family. I thought it seemed a bit dull, and figured it would be added to the "don't like" pile of games that aren't good to play with the family. However, although no-one was whooping it up, they said they'd enjoyed it. Score is likely to change after a few more plays.

May 2009 -- We haven't played this game in many years, but wore out at least one deck, playing it when our grandchildren were much younger.

October 2011 -- Surprisingly, we still get this one out now and then, just for variety and a quick game.

This is really not a good zoo.  It should be called, "Frank's Gorefest" since the whole play of the game is animals scarfing each other.  Carnage as a climbing card game, how can you not like it?

Frank Nestel threw a bunch of wonky stuff in there to give the game a unique spin, and I like the end result.  The cooperative/competitive partnership aspect of the game rewards thoughtful play, particularly when you're sitting next to your partner.  Other novelties include a looping and nonlinear card heirarchy, special points/penalties for certain cards, weak cards that become powerful in some situations, and the ability to receive help from your partner on your turn. It's still nothing approaching high strategy, but the gameplay is interesting and it allows some clever play.  Doris' whimsical and oh-so-good card art helps, too.

Simple "get rid of your cards" with bonus points for tricks that contain lions or hedgehogs. It's ok to play with kids but as an "adult only game" there is not much that entertains me because it's heavy luck dependent: Players that get mostly single animal cards in their starting hand have no chance winning against others that may start with pairs or triplets.

After one play, I liked this. I am not very good at it (need to think about strategy), but I liked the "changing partners" mechanism.

Updated (again) - really like this a lot. New people seem to really enjoy it, as well.

Seems like a re-themed, slightly dumbed down version of some other card games along the lines of Tichu, Gang of Four or the Great Dalmuti. Not too bad but stick with the prescribed limit on the number of players as we tried with 8 and it was definitely too many.

A quick and fun trick taking game, that's at its best at 4 players and up. We play it mostly 3-player though, and even then it's a fun game. Still, we're always looking to introduce it to others. 

However, the game has a small learning curve. Learning the mechanics is easy, figuring out the strategies is somewhat harder: cards are unique to the game and to really play the game well, you'll have to learn each animal's place in the food chain. Which'll take you a few rounds.

Good for families. Simple rules and a fun theme. It's a good introduction to climbing games. It works very well for a food chain theme. I also like how the rules get added on in the second round so as not to deluge new players with too much information. Pretty chancey though, and not much you can do with a bad hand. Can be a nice change from traditional trick-taking though.

Replayed with full scoring and partnering system - this MAKES the game!  Non-circular animal strengths become more second-nature with more plays, and makes for very interesting strategies due to the sought-after hedgehogs and lions.  Very interesting alternative to games like Big2 and Tichu.

.....

Didn't like the non-intuitiveness of the various strengths of animals.  The circular with spokes pictures made it difficult to sort your cards from low to high.

I really don't appreciate trick taking games as much as other people do, although I'm not sure this is a regular trick taking game, as a given player can play more than once.  People I was playing with called it, and other games that have a pile of cards that can be beaten by the same player more than once 'climbing games', but whatever.  I didn't care for the game.

It is described on its BGG page as a trick taking game but it doesn't fit my idea of that card mechanic.  Several friends say it is like "Scum" which I have never played.

First played this on Feb 8th, 2007.  This is another short game that tends to be more complicated.  It's a laddar game where certain cards beat other cards and you take a "trick" for points not necessarily for the number of the cards you take but which ones you take.  There is some strategy to this, however it wasn't apparent in the first shortened game we played.  It's worth another play to see more of how the mechanics and strategy work in this game.

Aug08: A very odd trick taking game.  I'm still not sold on the strict hierarchy of the animals, but it does make an odd thematic sense.

There are interesting decisions on whether to break up sets or not.

I think the most interesting part comes with the partnership rules.  I like the fluctuating partnership rules and how you pass cards and ask for help.

Just need to try it more!

Frank's Zoo is a light fun climbing game. Many non-gamers friends like it, perhaps because it doesn’t use any numbers (a friend told me this). It is very easy to teach and it plays fast. The art is very good. 

I like that the animal hierarchy is nonlinear as with most (if not all) climbing games I have played.

I still haven’t played with the partnership variant but I really want to try it, variable partnerships sounds fascinating. 

Bottom line, I enjoy the game and I want to play it again soon.

It's cute and I like the gameplay, but remembering which card beats what and the special card effects is needlessly confusing. Maybe a good player aid would help that?

RATING: 8
As in Tichu you play with a partner and have to get rid of your cards before your opponents do. Another similarity is in the possiblity to play double or triple sets at once. The difference to Tichu is in the bigger number of players and the special rules. Fun game for a group of 6 to 7 players who know the game.

I love ladder-climbing games, but my rating of this has dropped. The wrap around aspect of the card rankings limits your ability to take and maintain control, like in a normal ladder game. A decent filler for 6 or 7 players, but this game does not reveal complex strategies.

With adults, we always play with even numbers and with the partnership rules.

With kids, we just play first one out.  It is a big hit with kids from age 6 

I am on my 3rd deck simply due to the cards wearing out due to so much playing.

I have personally purchased over 15 copies of this game for others and for presents.  My game group always asks me to purchase games for them and their families and Frank's Zoo is, by far, the most requested.

I also have the Great Dalmutti, but since Frank's Zoo came out, we never play it.

Oddly unintuitive yet simple climbing card game.  It is almost embarassing how confusing the rules can be, though in reality the game is quite simple.  There isn't too much that's new about the game in terms of mechanics except for the wrap-around effect of a mouse beating an elephant.  I'm not necessarily a fan of the artwork per se.  I don't dislike it, but it doesn't win me over, either.  I much prefer the animal artwork in Die Drei Magier's games (like GoGoGo or Kakerlaken Poker).  I'm hoping to play this with my kids as they get older as an introduction to these types of games.

Endlessly entertaining as a light game, playable by the very young, but with some strategy to occupy adults' minds.  Plays fast.  It's a climbing game, like a lighter Tichu.

For the young, or to keep the game lighter, don't form partnerships and don't score lions and hedgehogs; just score for the order in which you empty your hand (e.g. 3,2,1,0 points for four players).

Acquired pre-2003. Total number of plays > 60. I will never turn down a game of Frank's Zoo. Quick and fun for the full range of 2-6 players (I've tried all). It also has that "one more round" factor and the circular nature of the cards makes this more interesting than a traditional trick-taking game.

RATING: 7
This is one of my favorite fillers for 6+ players. It is accessible to young kids and plays fast.  I especially like that round 1 is everyone for themselves and round 2 is teams. If you primarily play games with your family (includes kids) add this one to the mix.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun theme that keeps it easy to remember what cards outrank others (for the most part) as long as you remember the German saying about making any elephant out of a mosquito.  The mechanics are also solid.  However, I find there to be to small of a deck to support 6 or 7 players, 4 or 5 being very good, and 3 as yet unplayed (by me).

Of the climb and shed family of games, it compares favorably to The Great Dalmuti. Even though the art is a tongue-in-cheek paradise that might not work for everyone's tastes I think it is perfect to match the type of game Frank's Zoo is. I love the art on Great Dalmuti but its artwork, beautiful as it is, seems to think to highly of herself (oh the irony...) - Frank's Zoo is blue collar. It is something you can play with me, with a suit or with kid with a runny nose. Rulewise it surpasses Dalmuti because it hasn't got that lag associated with the fact you can pass whole rounds watching everyone around you play while you sit and watch, doing nothing - this has to do with the hierarchy of the cards that unlike Dalmuti can have the lowest card trump the highest and also with the fact that you can pass and still play cards later in the same round.

I couldn't help but feel the cards were too loaded in our 1 game. I realize this would even itself out over time and would normally be a non-issue.

Ahem. Anyway. Lots & lots of fun, Biggie (7) loves it and Otto (2) has already worked out most of the rules. I just wish she'd get the 'don't tell everyone else what is in mummy's hand' rule. Played with 3 and it's a bit *meh* but with 4 it's great fun and much less predictable. For me the rating is probably around a 7, but I've scaled it up because the kids love it so much.

Neat trick-taking game. Well you're not actually taking tricks as much as trying to go out first...

Not quite sure about the partnership rules and the way points are scored however. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fair card-game that may be a bit too clever for my taste.  You take tricks by having the most powerful animal card(s).  Each animal has strengths against other animals.  Basically it all comes down to timing and hand-management.  I thought the partnership rules were good.  In the end I would probably rather play a trick-taker that's a bit more straight-foward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A filler with a good rating from me. I really, really like this game. It is super easy to teach, especially when playing the suggested first hand without hedgehogs, lions, and alliances.

Played once.  This felt like a combination of hearts, bridge, and pinochle.  I generally dislike trick-taking card games (there's a reason I'm playing German-style board games and not Bridge), and this was no different.  I found it hard to remember exactly what card was superior to other cards, and difficult to figure out which cards were "better" (though, in fairness, both of those negatives would be taken care of by more play). Partnering based on the prior round's score was an interesting twist, but didn't seem like it really influenced the gameplay much.  I also greatly dislike that card counting is almost certainly a portion of the optimal strategy for this game, and thus have little interest in playing this again.

RATING: 7.25
This is a pretty cool trick-taking, hand-management card game where you want to be the first to play all your animals to the table but you can only play them depending on the last card(s) played because any animal played will limit what kind of animals can be played next, for example, if I play a Lion the following players will have to play either exactly 2 lions (can't play 3) or 1 Elephant... 

there are animals that are trumped by several other animals and the further you go up the food chain the less and less type of animals you can play.

It's pretty simple and fun game... Plays very well with 7!!
Will gladly play it again

RATING: 6
Pretty enjoyable game. Basically a ladder-climbing game with animals instead of numbers, which is kind of a neat twist. There are some exceptions here and there that make it so only certain cards can be played, and the partner rules work pretty well also. I think this would work well as a gateway game, since you're just trying to empty out your hands, and the animals in the thought bubbles are what beats the card(s) just played. After playing games like Tichu, however, I don't see the need to keep this around. Again, I like the fact that each card tells you what beats it, and I like that you can beat a set of cards by playing a higher set, but certain things kind of bother me, like how Alligators and Lions can only be beaten by Elephants and Killer Whales. It's kind of a weird hodge-podge of what beats what, and it doesn't even really make sense with the idea that certain animals would eat others. The game is fine, but Tichu has kind of fired it for me.

Combination of trick taking game, and trying to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. Suits are respresented by animals, with non-linear relationships between animals (eg only foxes can eat hedgehogs). Despite the simple artwork, and the fact that it can be played by kids, there is a lot of thinking and tough decisions on what cards to play. Games typically last an hour, with a few hands being played which should average out the distribution of the cards. Very good game.

A much deeper game than might appear after just a few plays. Works equally well as a simple everyone-for-himself game or as a partnership game. Adding the lion and hedgehog scoring is a must for experienced players. Warning-- I tried to teach this to a group of intelligent (or so I thought) adults and it was like pulling teeth. They just could not grasp the concept. After I thought about it, I realized that to non-gamers, the play of this game is quite foreign (though not so difficult to grasp as the group I was stuck with made it out to be!) so be patient if it takes a while for the light to go on sometimes.

Simple to learn and fast to play, has a nice food chain system going on and the possible change of free-for-all to partners game.  Fun overall.

Cute and unusual trick-taking game (maybe an idea that came up during their development of the excellent Mü?). The cards are not ranked in a typical manner -- there's no guarantee of transitivity (just because foxes beat hedgehogs, and polar bears beat foxes, does not mean that polar bears beat hedgehogs), there's circularity (rats beat elephants which beat lions which beat rats), and some odd exceptions (mosquitos can't beat anything, but can be teamed up with an elephant to act as a pair of elephants). I have doubts about replayability, since the novelty value of trying to figure out all the different food chain cycles is a big part of the delight.

Still super delightful, but more than once around and the game will really wear out its welcome. One of those "you play two hands, feels like you've played them all" things

Updated 1/1/2018:

14  years after first playing this — and not remembering anything about it, much less why I rated it a 5 — we played a 6-player game. Early on I could see why I rated it low, but after three rounds (and getting to implement partnerships) I know there’s more here.

Playing the game is fun but hand management is a bit painful (at the first games) because of so many different animals. This is only problem in the first game(s) as the food chains are quite logical. I found out that a help sheet here on geek with visual "who-eats-who" chart to be very helpful. 

Definitely the most fun climbing card game especially because of a very well working theme. Animals on cards are charming. The game works well starting from 4 to even 7 players. With 6 or 7 players you might want to use team-variant. When playing with 4 or 5 players I'd prefer to play without the teams. Either way, it is a really good game!

Update (15.10.2008): Decided to update my rating from 8 to 9.

I thought that it would fall by the wayside but it is still a firm favourite.

Great artwork on the cards. We played snap and simplified games with the girls early on. Now they are up for the full game. Its a great game for adults and kids - enough interest for the adults but the kids can still be competitive.

Has lasted in the long run.

Darkness was falling all over the house,
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The lions had come out, the hedgehogs lay too,
In one massive pile, what was I to do?
Rob had played elephants, the 3 he believed,
That would win him the pile, so nicely conceived.
So I motioned to pull out, 3 mice cards (beaut-teeeee)
The look on his face, was priceless to see!
Alas, I had two, but I laughed down the house,
I'd rate this an 8 - Rob says I'm a louse.

We play it as a closer with 5 or 6 players and it's proved durable.

Climbing game with nonlinear hierarchy of ranks.  I am not a fan of the rotating teams in this case because you share all "go out" points with your current partner.  This makes it impossible to overtake the lead after about halfway through the game if you are in one of the last two positions.  Instead, you are just choosing the winner.  There are other climbing games I would rather play.

This is a sweet card game. Its a climbing game in the same genre as Tichu and Haggis.  The partnership game, while more complex, is worth it, and even more fun.  It has a goofy feeling, like the art, but its not as light as you'd think, and well worth playing with gamers.  The ideal player count is 5 but it scales well from 4-6.  The beginners game is playable, and makes a perfect kids' game. 

I often tuck Frank's Zoo into my pocket when I'm going to a party. If the conversation gets tiresome ([i]real estate values? save me[/i]), I look for the kids and suggest a card game.

This is an excellent trick taking game that provides a lot of fun and unique aspects. The rules are rather difficult to explain without first seeing a hand, not to mention how the partners split up and what each are allowed to do. I quite enjoyed it though, but it seems to have gone over like a lead balloon with most of my gaming groups. I would love to play this a few more times as I think once the rules are cemented, it becomes something that is quite unique in an otherwise similar genre.

RATING: 8
Interesting variant of the "climbing" family of card games, in that unlike others (Tichu, Great Dalmuti, Das Grosse..), here the hierarchy isn't just linear. Instead it is more like a wonky ladder: one side is a lineage of sea animals, the other side with land (which loops from elephant to mouse); bridging the two sides are various animals which occupy land or sea. To play well involves committing to memory the cards played with the resulting gaps in the food chain and evaluating how strong your hand is at a given moment. Because of the ladder hierachy and the two options of beating a previous play, to some Frank's Zoo is alittle inaccessible, but rewards repeated play. Only niggle with more than 4 players (which I prefer, with more I'd pick Who's the Ass?) is that once out of cards you have to wait longer until only one player is left holding cards. As the game is played in rounds it is excellent for lunchtime play as you can resume the game the next day.

A light, entertaining card game that is inferior to "Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle" and "The Great Dalmuti", which are very similar games with the same mechanics. You can consider this the pictorial version of the above mentioned games. In Dilbert, each card has a number on it and the card can only be beaten by lower-numbered cards. Very intuitive. In FZ, on the other hand, each card has the picture of an animal and the small pictures of a select group of other animals that can beat that animal. Basically, the same game as Dilbert except, instead of "4 can only be beaten by a lower number, i.e. 3, 2, 1, and 0", players would have to carefully look at the pictures on each card to see which animals can beat the animal on the card. FZ is the muddied and convoluted version of Dilbert. By convoluted I certainly don't mean that it is in any way deeper or more tactical or strategical than Dilbert-- no, in fact it is somewhat the other way around due to a few special cards in Dilbert. I mean convoluted in the sense of changing an intuitive concept into a chore for the players. To be fair to FZ, I guess you could argue that it is a little less abstract than Dilbert due to the use of animals vs. numbers.

A nagyhal megeszi a kishalat, ezt ugye tudjuk, illetve azt is, hogy az egér fél a macskától, az elefánttól mindenki fél, ő viszont csak az egértől tart.
A játék pont erre épül, a kisebbek majd' mindenkitől félnek, a nagyobbak már szinte senkitől.
Egy pici csavar van benne még, miszerint ha kitesz valaki egy jegesmedvét, az elveszti a két vagy három jegesmedvével szemben, hisz ők csordában vannak! :)

RATING: 7
Frank's Zoo is a climbing trick taking game as are [GameId=215], [GameId=1814], [GameId=929], and [GameId=3085].  A player starts a trick by playing a certain combination of cards.  The next player either plays a combination that outranks the previously played combo or passes.  Play continues until all other players pass.  The player who played the highest ranking combo wins the trick and starts the next.  The goal is to be the first to rid your hand of cards.

What makes Frank's Zoo different?  In a normal climbing game the cards are numbered.  A low number may be out ranked by all higher numbers, i.e. a 1 would be outranked by a 2, a 10 and everything in between.  In Frank's Zoo there's no universal outranking.  Nothing out ranks an orca whale and it outranks seals, and polar bears but it does not outrank weaker cards like mosquitoes, mice or foxes.  Elephants are powerful, outranking the other large land animals, but are outranked by the lowly mouse.  The relatively weak hedgehog is only outranked by the fox.

So there exist several loops and branches is the ranking of the animals.  This gives a specific value to each card rather than the typical trend of making high cards universally better than low cards.

I love tick taking and climbing games.  But I'm not a fan of partnership games unless the partners change throughout the game and players do not share wins.  Frank's Zoo has the fluctuating partnerships which makes for some fun decisions about how to get the right player to be your partner.  Players get points based on the order they can completely rid their hand of cards.  First out gets the most points, last out gets nothing.  Partners add their exit points together.

To add even further spice, certain cards provide penalties and bonuses to an [i]individual's[/i] score.  This adds an additional wrinkle to how and when you play your cards.

I love Frank's Zoo.  It hits all the right buttons with me.  It's a climbing trick-taking game with changing partners.  It's thematic, fun and innovative.  Brilliant.

Sold it.
After loving Haggis as a two player for years , decided to buy it again to see if my opinion changes and I can enjoy the game with four and get that same feel as I do from Haggis, whilst overlooking the cartoony art.

after first play: It didn´t really get me,  either you had the matching card or you did not, there was not much to choose from. Of course that depends on your hand of cars, but the complete game it was like that. Teamplay didn´t improved that much, there were very rare cases with matching cards.

A good entry in the genre of "climbing games" by being recursive.  Fairly pointless with adults, but good fun with kids.  Leave out the sea creatures (small and big fish, seals, polar bears and orcas) and you can play quite well with 3 players.

First off, I'm not a huge trick taking game fan but this game really pulling me in once we started playing.  The hierarchy of cards with is cyclical system really is interesting to determine what is really valuable.  This is important because the revolving partnerships one must know what to give to your partner and when determining opening the trick.  However, your partner isn't always someone you want to help as you don't share in individual points.  I really enjoyed this game and is probably my favorite trick taking game.  Really unique, with nice artwork.

RATING: 7.5
I find this to be a suprisingly deep game.   It's light on the exterior, so somewhat easy to learn, but as the players get better the strategies evolve, too, like Tichu, maybe.  Additionally, this is a great game for 4,5,6, or 7 players, there is an interesting team mechanic that works fine with odd numbers of players.
i take off a point because the cards are paper and subject to wear quickly, and another 1.5 points because it's still just a luck game.

It is a perfect family game for 4 to 7 players. You can squeeze a short game into 30 minutes, or you can take some 'quality' time and play longer.

The rules are easy to teach, even the scoring of the lions and hedgehogs. And because it is a team game with changing teams, everybody gets some points every round, so that the younger kids do not get frustrated.

I own this game for quite a while and I changed my initial rating from 7 to 8 (May 2016), because of its staying power.

A good light card game if you don't want to do too much thinking - less than in Sticheln. It doesn't take too long to learn what to do and what not to do strategies. Should play well with a range of ages and gamer types. Good with seven players. Gets an extra point for a fun theme. Like making a mountain out of a molehill I like making an elephant out of a mosquito.

RATING: 7.5
Tichu light. Well kinda. 

It's a climbing card game with a food chain, actually two of them which are partly intertwined. Rules are simple: you either go one up the food chain, or add one more of the cards leading the trick (if it's one, you must add two, if it's two you must add three). There are same narrow spots (hedgehog), a circular path (mouse "eats" elephant). 

It has a variant (which I recommend) of playing in teams that change every round, depending on the score - my favourite type of teams in card games.

Playing just once I liked it, it's light but neat. Illustrations I didn't like at first, but they grew on me.

RATING: 7.5
The first round a very typical climbing type trick taking game with an animal theme (think Great Dalmuti and Gang of Four). Everything else after is a brilliant take on the genre. Based on the positions in the first game, players are are paired up. For example, in a 4player game, P1+4 and P2+3 will play as partners for the rest of the game.

Partners have to work closely to win tricks. A nice touch: a junior partner can lay down a card/s and ask the senior partner to add to the hand. In addition, retaining 2 lion cards when the opposing team goes out also awards points. Fun and meaty and scales up to 7.

I can't understand why people would play with anything less than the advanced partnership rules!

Downgraded to a 5. Fun game for a lunch time, enough skill to be interesting but quite a dose of luck required too.

I don't want to knock the Zoo too much, it was a fun game for me for a while.  Time to move on - but I doubt that I will be allowed to by some of my co-workers...

I thought it might be a good one for my kids, but I'm not so sure they'll be able to grasp the rules.  Will have to try again, although I'm not in a hurry to do so.

RATING: 7
I have not yet played this game with the changing partners rules yet, which by all accounts is the best way to play this game, so my opinions may change once I get that opportunity.

At the moment however this is a reasonably standard trick-taking/ladder-climbing game with really cutesy and fun animal artwork.  Players take turns playing cards from their hand that either match the number previous played but increase in rank or are one higher than the number previously played in the same rank.  There are some additional features like that a mosquito can act as an elephant or a mouse is the only animal that can beat an elephant but otherwise it is a standard trick taking game and not much else.

Sure enough, the game is much better with partners.  After the first round the players are divided almost into winners and losers brackets and the highest ranked players from each bracket are paired up.  So in a 4-player game the 1st and 3rd place players would partner up.  Then there is an exchange of two cards before the round begins and the junior partner can ask the senior partner to contribute cards to win a trick.  This introduces some interesting decisions since you want both members of your team to finish highly but you also personally want to finish just slightly ahead of your partner, plus next round you may have a different partner completely.

The way the partners work certainly elevates this game into something unique and original, otherwise it is a little bit bland.  I think I would only play this game in the future with these partnership rules but would quite enjoy it that way.

[RGG 1999 edition] {Animal, filler; shedding, partnership; optimal 5p} {basic game 5, changing partnership 5.5} Frank's Zoo is a twisted shedding game with partnership system. It's a nice game for children but it's too simple for most gamers. The non-linear hierarchy of ranks reduces the luck element a little. The partnership system provides more controls and enhances player interaction. However, the partnership system is too simple for my taste. (I would prefer something like 'Express' that you have to carefully read the mind of your partner)

Doris's illustrations are cute, as usual. The animal theme is confusing at first but it can be overcome through a few plays.

I'm not sure how to feel about this game.  I would NEVER want to play it with gamer friends--it's just too light for me.  So the real question is--is it better than other card games I can play with my family?

I don't think so.  I don't like the partnership/individual aspect of the game where you get stuck in a partnership and can't really win.  I'd rather it be every man for himself all the way down the line.  Give me Oh Hell or one of its variants over this game, though I will admit that the rock-scissors-paper aspect of the game is fun.

Played 5  times.  I like the game a lot, but I'm not a big fan of the partnership rules, because the first player and the 2nd last always get the same number of points.  ie. it is very hard to catch up...  Maybe it is just always hard to catch up.  Perhaps, the partners should be lower and the first player should play by himself... Maybe I just don't like the scoring system very much... hmmm...  I like playing the game though.

After one partial play, it seems like a game where you really need to play repeatedly to understand how the different animals play.  When to play one type of animal is definitely not obvious the first time through.

A problem that frequently surfaces is that people tend to keep their lions to late in the game (when nobody can beat them), which takes a bit of the fun out of it. And ... mosquitos have only two wings! It annoys me every time I see them with four. Other than that - great artwork!

A game based on the classic "asshole". Teamplay and the scoring mechanisms of lions and hedgehogs make this variation the best I've seen so far.

RATING: 7.5
A very charming light, "climbing" card game for 3-5 players.

I've played this many times with children with good success; just play the first hand without the hedgehog and lion scoring, then add those rules in.

Ignore the partnership rules -- if you want to play a serious partnership climbing game, play Tichu instead.

An okay ladder climbing game, doesn't really grab us, though.  Substituting animals for numbers doesn't work as well as you might think.

Nice, light fun game we play at the beach.  We play 4 hands in teams of 2 v 2.  Passing 3 cards each hand to partner to (hopefully) improve the hands.  Like the timing element in the game.

This is really cute, I love the art, but I've had trouble convincing myself that it's not mostly luck, and somehow I find the "food-chain" mechanic unsatisfying (not enough control?). Then again, I'm usually not that crazy about climbing and trick-taking card games.

Thought this game was really clever for what looks like a kids game.  Visual clues on the cards make the game easy to teach at first, but it takes a few hands to really understand some of the traps you might get tripped up on.  I love how kind of wacky it is with how the teams are formed, and with less stress that you might bomb your teammate which you tend to get in similar team-card games.  However... the game has never gone over great, people seem to regularly get frustrated with it.

Rating after 1 5-player game. It is a fun game but only for about 2 rounds. After that, it becomes not very involving. I liken it to watching a TV show which appears to be interesting and when the advertisements come on interest in the show is lost. Perhaps I was playing with the wrong crowd.

I was hoping for a game similar to The Great Dalmuti that kids could enjoy and this is close but something is missing. I may just need to find the right # of players for it (Dalmuti is best with 8 and I will only play it with 8).

RATING: 5
So, it's a climbing game, where this animal beats that animal, beats this animal.  Got it.  Wait, the rankings go full circle, so you can start a trick all over again?  OK, that sounds good.  And the whole point is to get rid of cards, right?  No?  You get points based on what you collect?  But ... the tricks can reset based on the cards someone else has played, yes?  Hm.  OK.  I guess that makes sen--

Wait, WHAT?  I'm on a different team each round?  Seriously?  No, I understand, most games DO require repeat playings to get the strategy of how to win, but it helps when they're a little intuitive, hey?  This one, though ...  it's downright convoluted.

1 play: 4 players
2 plays: 5 players

RATING: 8.5
A pleasant surprise for me.  I don't like trick taking games in general but this one has a non-linear food chain hierarchy that really appeals to me.  The game really has a lot of replayability due to the few extra rules that make the lions worth points and losing a point for not having hedgehog/s.  Really well thought out game with great artwork & high accessibility.

Quite like it, one of my more favorite games, it's simple, fast, and fun. The graphics and theme are cute. Sometimes I forget the finer points, but overall it's one that is enjoyable. Not too much strategy involved, very light, good for a break in between heavier games or just for some great times when waiting for someone to arrive, etc. For what it is, it does well.

This is an example of where I stumble across an older rating and wonder whether it's accurate - especially given that this is one of the first euros that I ever purchased.

Time to give it a spin with the family and see if it still holds up.

13 years after the initial purchase: It doesn't hold. :(

Fix the lion scoring rules to make them less auto-winny and you might have something.

Very weird game, similar to Tichu, but with animals and no numbers. It is really difficult to devise a strategy to get rid of the cards, because of the chaotic nature of the who eats who mechanics. There may be players that would love that, but I definitely don't.

This game was a real disappointment. Apart from the fact that there were rules missing from the rulebook, too much of the game was spent with players saying "pass". In addition, the scoring seemed a bit lame and the rulebook spent too much time trying to explain the rules to Bridge. If I wanted to play Bridge, I'd play Bridge. Not a very good game all in all, which is a shame, because Ark (by the same people) is an excellent game.

This might be the first "climbing" or "ladder" game I've played... and I like the concept.  We were playing single hands as whole games and that was okay... but I'd really try to play this again with multiple hands and proper scoring.  I did like how the "values" of the cards could wrap and how different cards would interact in the climb.

Cute little trick-taking game for the kids and possibly non-gamers.  There are some nice ideas for the hierarchy of the cards, but way too simplistic.  I'd rather be playing Tichu than a watered down version.

Trick-taking card game with animals.  Each animal can take a logical subset of the rest, bigger taking smaller, until it comes full circle as the mouse takes the elephant.

I found the simplicity and the one-note mechanics (trick-taking) to be rather boring but it's a reasonably cute short-time investment I suppose.

RATING: 6.5
It is similar to The Great Dalmuti, but I would say it is heavier due to the odd relationships between the different cards.  We haven't tried out the rules for partner play yet.

After 1 Play: I only got a partial game in, so I didn't really get a grasp of the strategy.  I'd like to play again.

After 2+ Plays: A cute idea, but in practice too much mental effort is expended in remembering what eats what, and not enough in strategic play.

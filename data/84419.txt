Seems intriguing.. a wargame with some interesting ideas. 

I'd like to try it, but somehow - forgive my shallowness - I find it really difficult to get really excited about a game that looks so visually unappealing... 

---

Yeah, it's off-puttingly ugly, takes forever to play, is extremely fiddly and riddled with annoying bookkeeping issues that will result in inevitable mistakes and a lot of tedious and boring micromanagement. Pen and paper, seriously?

This kind of games belong in the computer world, not on tabletop. This seems like a poor analog version of something I played in the late 80s. Never again.

Space Empires is a war game on an interstellar level.  The rules are simple but allow for very complex situations to arise and this is the game's greatest strength.  The game also has a very pleasing crescendo of action.  At the beginning players are exploring their domain and exploiting resources.  This phase of the game is used as a springboard into the conflict oriented middle and end game.  The overall game arch does go on a bit too long.

It uses no blocks, but it is effectively a block war game with extensive "cloud of war" stylings.  As such it’s reminiscent of many Columbia war games.  For personal reasons I dislike such game mechanisms.

A game with great potential [on the eve of the first epansion 'Close Encounters'] that currently suffers from 'limp' Victory Conditions.

Either stick to the original victory conditions of winning once you take an opposing home world or; raise the colony-points required to win [negating some of the 'luck' in finding close proximity planets to colonise in deep space] and/or remove VPs for losing a colony or 'production level'.

This is too simple a game to justify the price or to remain interesting for very long. The mounted board is utterly pointless.

I think this would play well as a website game. Sadly here you have to do all the digital stuff yourself, on paper, and you will make a lot more mistakes than would a computer. But after a while you don't care anymore.

Some of the advanced rules are there to get past obvious problems connected with the game's simplicity eg. the power of the enemy's defence gets much more powerful than your offence as you get closer to his bases. The crap about "20 years in the making" is reminiscent of Serge Laget and Mare Nostrum, but its rather worse here as there's very little that hasn't been done before. Clearly you tend to get one X out of four most of the time, since its hard to do the other three once all the hidden counters have been flipped.

Perhaps GMT should consider a simple games range for new players, partially as a warning to the rest of us.

Just acquired recently.  Solitaire option and excellent reviews helped to make the decision (plus 40% off due to a dinged box).  After playing a partial game, feels like a simpler version of SFB, except the record-keeping is performed for the entire fleet / side, not each ship.

This is the space empire game that I have been looking for my whole life.  In the early 80s, I played [thing=1594][/thing] and later [thing=36][/thing], but those two did not scratch the itch because the designers favored the Federation/Gorn alliance.  In this one, YOU decide on your ships and technology.  There are so many decisions.  It also has heaping helpings of fog of war.  
Jim Krohn created [thing=41429][/thing], the perfect WWII/squad level game and now he's created the perfect space empire game.  Both are elegant and simple all at once.

Love the theme, love the fog of war mechanic.  However in my games what tends to happen is a very slow build up followed by an all out attack involving a lot of repetitive dice throwing caused by a rather antiquated combat resolution system.

RATING: 9
So much fun - especially with Close Encounters Expansion.  Love the variety of ships, techs, empires, scenarios and strategies.  Love the fog of war - it's brilliant.  Love the variety of ways to get income.  It's really epic with so much replay value.
Downsides would be that it can be a bit 'mathy' and large games take a while to play.  But overall it's great even without the expansion.

A solid 4X game.  Well done and squarely hits the X's.  I like the bluffing element in having the tokens face down.  I dislike the fiddly nature of tracking expenditures and unit upgrades.  I also dislike the plain nature of the artwork - the theme is there but it's not hitting you in the face.  They *are* chits fer cryin' out loud.

A good game but not flashy enough or novel enough to really grab me.  Still, very well done and worth the occasional play.

First of all, I loved the theme of this game, I enjoy the Scy-Fi space atmosphere. This game is elegant in mechanics, basicaly you move 3 times and make the maintenence of your fleet, collect incomming from your colonies, buy upgrades and new ships.

The game ends with the surrender of the enemy or with the home colony of the enemy destroyed, so it is a classic 4X system.

The exploration is very well done and thematicly fits. I liked the way you cover your fleet from the enemy, he never knows what to expect when he tries to fight it. But it has a bad thing, too, this game is for the honests since it is VERY easy to cheat. Hopefully I play only with friends I know that don't like to cheat, but this game loses it's shine if someone cheats. It can happen that someone cheat accidently and no one is there to correct an ilegal placement or something like that.

Despite of this little problem, the game is great, the upgrade lines are interesting, variety of ships are vast, their mechanics simple and functional and the game gets better with advanced rules (that I didn't played yet).

Still not sure about my rating after 3 games. I like the idea and the mechanics A LOT. Game length in anything but a 2-player game can be pretty bad, though, and the early turns lack direct confrontation and interaction. At this point it is probably a 7.5 or maybe an 8 for me.

Fast paced (game may take about 4-6 hours)and simple 4X game that is very well refined for any type of gamer. 

The expansion and space ship upgrades are systematic and easy to use and understand. The different pictures of space crafts are good enough to give a certain flavor to each race. 

The warp gates are a blast to play. With or without them, most games would have confrontation latest by turn 3!

Expansion of your planets are also easily tracked and gives a fantastic feel of expanding your empire. No fiddly tracking of different resources for minute gains.

This game is much better than Eclipse or Twilight Imperium, but lacks the plastic bling and requires a little bit of accounting, and so gets love only from wargamers. That's too bad, because it's no more complex than those games and much easier to learn the intricacies (but just as hard to master).

Played the two Doomsday Machine solo scenarios so far. Plays very smooth. It is not as complicated to play as it looks. As a solitaire game it is good, but not as excellent as Struggle for the Galactic Empire. Next i will play scenario 3 with opposing alien races, which are a kind of AI-Opponents. 

UPDATE:
The alien scenario is a much better solitaire experience then the Doomsday Machine. With the help of chrono280's flowchart in the download section the alien races are easy to play. The aliens don't move around to explore. Their empires develop with a nifty chart and some dice rolls. If they decide to attack you they build a fleet and actually move on the board. This mechanic makes for a smooth solitaire experience.

I bought this because I read that it was similar to Eclipse. I opened it and was immediately disappointed - no variable board, counters that manage to be even lamer than Eclipse's ships, and rules that were very detailed. My fault for not doing proper research before purchasing.

Together with [gameid=113942] this is the ultimate space empire building game for me. I don't need any other!

[u]Pros[/u]:
* The way space is explored.
* The doomsday machine scenarios are worth playing.
* Two player games work extremely well.

[u]Cons[/u]:
* The game heavily favors the defender. This discourages attacking.
* Limited countermix.
* You can do nothing the whole game and invest only in technology. Then at the end you attack with Dreadnoughts. In my opinion technological advances cannot be obtained without combat experience.
* I have a preference of d6's above d10's.

[u]Thoughts[/u]:
* Should have been a blockgame.
* In equal combat situations the Attacker should fire before the defender, since he took the initiative. Like plane combat and it encourages attacking.
* First buy new ships, then develop technology. This way it is not so easy to answer an attack with superior technology.

Picked this up for the solo potential without doing enough research first.  It's very wargamey, which isn't really my cup of tea.  Ran through the doomsday scenario once or twice, but it didn't really click for me. Seems like a well put together game though.  So if you're more inclined to enjoy a wargame, and appreciate a spacey theme, it's probably a solid choice.

I can already tell that I am going to thoroughly enjoy this series.

Rated on solitaire plays only. I have only played the Doomsday Machine scenarios so far, but enjoying the puzzle and challenge of exploring technology options, managing economy and the increasing pressure of strengthening assaults from the Doomsday Machines. Haven't tried the Alien scenario yet - will try this once I need something new from this game. I do have some concern that eventually I will figure out how to best play the solitaire scenarios and will need something new to freshen it up...hopefully I am wrong.

Rating after two plays.

Enjoyable, but the victory conditions (destroy an opponent's home world) seem to make this a game of opportunistic raiding rather than empire building. Long term strategies won't come to fruition.

On the other hand, this might be because new players have a tendency to under defend their home world thinking that other players will ravage their colonies first.

As a Eurogamer, this was never going to be my type of game, hence the low rating.  We finished a two player game after 12 turns and about 4 hours, fairly evenly balance and we called it a draw.

The game is well constructed and thought out.  A bit of book-keeping to keep track of your income, expenditure and fleet.

But dice roll heavy and luck dependant.  I fail to see why anyone would want to spend as long as this game takes on a dice fest.  There is so much more interaction and decision making required in a good Euro in a fraction of the time.

The game potentially follows as story arch as planets and minerals are found, colonised and sequestered.  But once a game starts to tip in one direction then I can see it would take a few turns of going through the motions for the win to be achieved.  But I believe an honourable resignation is acceptable in these circumstances. Against that I can see that two even players could be playing out a chess style draw fairly often.

I enjoyed learning the game, but feel no desire to play again.

Lots of accounting. Slow. But old school fun and great poker/bluffing decisions. Really this would probably be better as a moderated PBEM, but if you have a long afternoon (or full day) and like 4x games, this is certainly an option.

Also, I'm really enjoying the solo Alien Power game (so much that I've been tweaking it to try and give the Aliens a more credible AI).

RATING: 4
After one unfinished play I don't think that its long playing time and extreme fiddliness are rewarded enough by the actual gameplay. Moreover, I would be hesitant to play it again because of the aforementioned fiddliness - the chits are too small and thin to operate them comfortably, escpecially since they need to be moved around stacked.

RATING: 6
Initial Impression: Although this game is fiddly, with hidden information that must be consulted frequently, I don't think it detracts from the game. However, like most computer RTS games, there will come a point in the game where one player's resource and fleet production will outmatch the other's and lead to an inevitable end. At that time, playing out the rest of the game is almost pointless as the losing player would need incredible swings of good luck in order to catch up to the winner.

This looks like an excellent two player or team game, but I'll need to play more to verify. The multiplayer non team victory conditions as published make for an impossibly long game. The designer did release updated victory conditions which sound much better. The game is not as involved as Twilight Imperium III but may be almost as long! I do prefer over it TI3 though because it is easier to manage.

Space Empires 4X is a wargame with reasonably simple and intuitive rules.  The game features an excellent hidden information tech tree mechanic that adds some flavour and depth to the game.  

SE4X may not be for everyone, as some may find it long and may dislike the  book keeping it requires.  For me, SE4X is exactly the kind of wargame I like: simple, intuitive rules; difficult choices; and can be finished in a single evening (5 hours or less)!

In addition, the production value of this games is very high.  Each of the four empires features its own detailed counter art, the board looks great and Roger MacGowan's retro box design and rule/scenario books cover art fit the theme perfectly.

Haven't played it yet... Punching the chits was a nightmare... I'm not a wargamer so I'm not used to this kind of sub-par counters (compared to say Small World).

Edit: I played it and I liked it. 
Some things annoyed me (although wargamers are probably used to them):
- having to have the chit indicating how many ships there are under each unit is an annoyance.
- very very slow and boring first half of the game (I liked the second part of the game though!)
- annoying book keeping (yeah, I know there's an official variant!) and I don't like when I have to pencil down everything I do.

I personally don't like dice at all, but in this game it didn't bother me at all.

Despite my complaints, it's still a good game and I would recommend it. I'll probably sell it anyway because I probably won't find anybody to play this kind of game with.

Too soon to rate it, but the rating will be high. The rule set is amazing, the game is deep, very modular, and elegant. Very good solo playability, and first 2p games simply wonderful. I like that the sides are symmetric, red vs. blue vs. green, no forced theme, no kilograms of plastic. 

Basic rules seem logical, and are expanded, rather then replaced by the advanced rules. There are many additions, and it seems that due to the simplicity of the core, there is much room for experimentation. Kudos to the designer, Jim Krohn, he did a wonderful job.

Designer / publisher support is excellent - rulebooks were updated in my reprint edition, and they are available on the publishers site in all formats, Kindle included.

Update: after several plays, the game delivers on all promises; essentially, it's space chess, and I love it

 This game is awesome. Played against the doomsday machines scenario...on easy and lost- but loved every moment -
After exploring and expanding my empire I had forgot to fortify the outer rim allowing the "DM'S" to move in and start killing all my planets!!! Whats so great about this game is that as soon as my planets started to fall I instantly knew what my fatal error was- no dice blaming - no broken rules- I could see that I had made a costly mistake that caused my system to fall- it was incredible - a lot of choices- but only so much resource. I can't recommend this game enough and I'm sure as I play - the rating will go up.

RATING: N/A
After one play of the basic game rules and the short scenario victory conditions: My first point of comparison is with Stellar Conquest, due to all the book-keeping surrounding available resources, technology development, and ship-builidng. There's a little bit of Twilight Imperium with the various things you can find in the depths of space.

After that, it's WWI Navies in space—complete with dreadnoughts, battlecruisers, and destroyers. The goal being to reduce your opponent's homeworld into rubble.

As a straight-forward build-ships-and-fight game, it's pretty fun. The fog of war elements definitely keep you on edge until battle reveals important information. But if you're like me, you may have been looking for something a bit weirder with less book-keeping. After peeking into the Space4x expansion, it looks like there may be some real twists to this game left in store.

Graphically and ergonomically, it's a bit cumbersome. You'll be using your eraser a lot and it looks like fans are already developing some detailed log sheets. The hexes are bit small for all the chits that will flood the map, leaving me to wonder if larger hexes (and fewer of them) and some tweaking of the movement technology might not have made the game a little tighter.

But I'm sure for many, having some time and space to develop a prospering empire before it is flung into a costly and devastating war is a big part of the fun.

Very good game in the genre. More 'up to date' than
Stellar Conquest, but probably the base game of SE4X
comes a little weaker in my estimation - with more 
emphasis on actual military engagement and less on 
developing planets.

Still, SE4X promises to continue to be developed through
expansions, while SQ (sadly) never got much in the way
of options - and nothing 'official' that I'm aware of.

Tight, solid, modular design.  Hits the best facets of wargaming without belaboring the point.  I've never gone wrong when a game provides possibility for deep post-session analysis, and this one has that in spades.  

Haven't played this one extensively yet, but there seems to be a ton to enjoy here; this isn't a one trick pony.  Looking very much forward to digging into the advanced and solo rules.  A definite new gem of my collection and something that pleased me more than expected upon first play.  My buddy, a non-wargamer, thoroughly enjoyed the experience as well.

Reminds me of some good old computer games which is not bad. First half of the game is interesting since building the empire is generally fun. Problems rise when the expansion is over and game should go into extermination. There's so much space that this takes a lot of time to complete and I definitely would not play the game without alternative game ending conditions.

It was fun but for what I got the game took far too long to finish and we did not play until elimination.

RATING: 5
Obviously a labor of love and I respect what the designer accomplished with this, but unfortunately the compromises made to achieve the short play-time leave this a bland, soulless experience. I feel no connection to my empire; it doesn't feel like I'm expanding through space - just that I'm flipping counters over. The record-keeping is fine; in fact, in some ways it's a little MORE onerous than with Stellar Conquest (but I don't mind it). At the end of the day, too many compromises to achieve the desired result. I'm sure this will appeal to a lot of people, but not me.

Really gives the feeling of the 4X style of game, with a real focus on the extermination. This game was highly enjoyable, and with so many options it feels like a sand box where you can play with as much or as little as you please. Highly enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to playing more.

Die eigenen Notizen und die Berechnungen lassen das Spiel anfangs ein wenig altbacken wirken.

Der Mechanismus mit dem geheimen Flottenbewegungen in Verbindung mit den Decoys sorgt immer wieder für schmunzler. Jedes Schiff hat auch später noch einen Sinn hat (Point Defence, Sensoren, u.ä.), dadurch müssen Flotten ausgewogen aufgestellt werden.

+ Geheime individuelle Forschung
+ Das Spiel fühlt sich episch an
+ Viele Optionen
+ Einfaches Regelwerk
+ unzählige sinnvolle Tech Variationen möglich

- schlechte Spielmarkerqualität

If you must play this game - and I don't recommend it - see if anyone has some 5/8" RDOXX counter sleds lying around somewhere. Especially for the two player game, they make for a massive usability improvement.
---
Rating reduced to 3. Final judgement on Space Empires after four plays: this is a failure as a game. Well-intentioned, and with good ideas, but the horribly bloated playing time combined with bad pacing and too much inertia kills it dead. The "short" 2-player game has about 45 minutes of game in it but will take 3 hours to play. I have no reports of a 4-player game coming in at anything under 6 hours. This is ludicrous - there is so little game on offer in this package, anything over 90 minutes for 2 players or 3-4 hours for multiplayer is unreasonable. The designer has frequently sworn you can do these shorter times, but I simply don't believe it's possible under normal conditions. Working from first reasonable assumptions about how much time it takes to fill in the spreadsheets and actually make decisions and physically move counters, and accounting for the raw time involved in simply traversing the board, the math is just ugly. If you love the game and have played it dozens of times and can play fast and don't have to think that much, maybe, but that's not a reasonable set of assumptions.

Interestingly, this may find a niche as a solitaire game - the small single-player games can be completed in under 2 hours and are not terrible. But that's a thin rope to be holding on to. There isn't a ton of good solitaire stuff out there, but there are better things than this.
---
Almost everyone has reported monstrous playing times for their first game, and this is not unexpected here. Let's work from first principles: we have multiple players starting in completely symmetric far-corner starting positions with the same OOBs and tech availability going at it in a straight military-industrial contest that uses a highly attritional combat system in which cheap defensive units are available. It's not unexpected that games are going to take forever. Are things going to improve with experience? Maybe. The more pressing question: do I care enough to find out? Space Empires probably gets one, *maybe* two more plays to see if it can deliver.
---
Take the rating or leave it, it's based on one play of the 3-player team game and a few solitaire plays. Really not impressed, and the 3p team game is strongly not recommended - very unstable, and it doesn't drive to any sort of conclusion; we played 4 hours to almost a stalemate. Very dubious on the promises the game has made. Shipyard restrictions, cheap bases, and the distances involved mean attacks peter out very quickly and the game has a lot of inertia. Leading to turtling and hedging. Also, since this is fundamentally a game of attrition and grinding down your opponent, you can be facing an effectively lost game due to bad dice and getting fatally behind on the attrition math early with a long slog before you actually lose. Not sure. There are a few glimmers of counterbalancing hope, including the fact that low-level raiding can be effective and that defense is generally harder to play than offense, but decent levels of force seem so hard to project and the pace of the game seems too slow. I want to play the 4-player team game or 2-player game to get a final read, but I'm not that optimistic right now that the fundamentals are there. Tracking tech levels of individual fleets probably sounded like a more interesting idea than it actually is - the combined bookkeeping for tracking that and economics means almost as much spreadsheeting as gaming, belying the games obvious computer game origins. Too much accounting really for a FtF game. And the ergonomic difficulties involved in manipulating a bunch of face-down fleet chits - with numbers under them - are a bit crazy.

I think multiplayer, which I think means 4p or 2p vs. 2p since the 3p experience was not good, is the opening for this game. 2p is OK, but why would I not play Imperium (GDW edition obviously), Dark Nebula, or Fifth Frontier War instead? Space Empires offers nothing over those games. To be clear, I still hold out some significant hope that the multiplayer versions will be fun, and I look forward to trying straight 2p small game to see if it comes in at 90min or less. But there is a lot of circumstantial evidence here that the fundamental design hasn't grappled at all with the issues we've all know about for well over 20 years, and which have been successfully addressed by 30-year-old classics like Titan and Dune.
---
Chris' FYI play tip: If you do the math on the size of an economy that you can generate with your home chits - about 55 CP recurring, plus minerals - it becomes clear that in a the smaller-sized games, you're just not using large chunks of the tech tree. You're unlikely to ever see anything bigger than a BC, or 3 levels combined between Attack, Defense, and Speed. Look to Raiders and CVs/Fighters for cheap-ish firepower. Don't wait too long to crank out ships; first person to pull the trigger with a decent mix of ships and tech seems likely to have a significant edge. Merchant Pipelines will change the math, but not by a lot - they're almost more interesting for the "road" ability to route forces internally quickly.

Still somewhat torn on the game. I like the efficiency of the design, and it may reward offense more than it first appears. But there are a lot of things about it that are a royal pain, from managing face-down ships to maintaining paperwork records of the tech level of every fleet. Lots of information presentations issues too; classes of ships needed to be much more distinct. And it still strikes me as pretty flavorless. But it still has the empire-building/exploration pull, so probably fun for a few games anyway. Better than Conquest of Paradise? Probably not. CoP wasn't good enough to engage for more than a handful of games, and it only took 90-120min for 4 players.
---
Tried out the larger solitaire scenario; it's definitely not as interesting, and was abandoned. A 90-minute game that ends in a dice crap-shoot is OK, 2.5 hr, not so much.
---
Played the small solitaire scenario once. A lot of state to track, especially with different fleets and different tech levels, and a fair amount of accounting. It's not bad on the scale of things, but definitely start with a small scenario until you get your head around things. I was skeptical of the rules' warning to not include fighters, raiders, and mines until you know what you are doing, but now understand. Finances (at least in this scenario) are pretty tight and so choices about tech spending and how to develop your fleet are key. My game saw only about 5 total tech levels developed, and they get crazy expensive. A larger scenario would, of course, offer more latitude - but be significantly longer. It only took me about 90 minutes to do the short solitaire scenario, which isn't bad having never played before. The small scenario is definitely a knife-fight, you get very little warning of where the Doomsday machines will show up, and with only two economic phases between arrival and the incineration of your home world, you don't have a lot of slack.
---
Well, I kept my pre-order because I'm a sucker for this sort of game, but reports of 5+ hour playing times are somewhat disturbing. This is not an engine or an idea that's going to be that interesting much past 2.5-3hr. The box makes no claims at all about playing time, which is a bit of a red flag these days. The range of scenarios provided is a plus though (I'll definitely take the designers advice and play the team game the first couple times). On the other hand, I am hard-pressed to identify even a single original thought in this game. Bits from Conquest of Paradise, bits from every other space game ever made ... its sole apparent originality is in its compactness. Which is definitely not nothing. But I can't help thinking really, this is it? Not one clever twist, no racial powers, no event deck, no weird spacial anomalies, no asymmetry of any kind? Maybe some military leaders, or mercenaries, or warp drives, or anything? Really? What were those cool super-weapons from Freedom in the Galaxy?

This is all a lot of griping for a game I haven't played, and honestly, I knew what I was getting in to and so really don't have much right to complain. Plus I got a mounted map, which is cool. And, oddly, I  am looking forward to playing it to a surprising degree. Still, though, I can't help but miss the one clever and/or flavorful system or parameter that would have really punched this game up.
---
Sigh. I have this on pre-order, and just finished reading the just-released preview rules. I have to say, it looks like a completely by-the-numbers microwave job, basically just a made-over Conquest of Paradise. The only way it'll be any good is if it's been well-parameterized, i.e., if the costs and risks are well calibrated and if the economic system has enough inertia and variability. Honestly, I wouldn't bet money on any of these things being true.

Another huge factor will be play time and scenarios. The presence of a team game is something of a draw, and if it can come in at 90min, 2hr tops, there will be hope.

Still, with all the interesting space/naval games and combat systems to draw on - GDW Imperium, Victory in the Pacific, Fire in the Sky, Asia Engulfed - it's a little depressing to see just how uninteresting the core combat system is here.

RATING: 3.5
While I can see this is a good design, I don't care much for it myself. The main reason is that it's simply too long for the amount of meaningful and interesting decisions it offers. Furthermore, I've only played it once, and that was with three players; I highly recommend all of you to avoid playing this with 3! It's a horrible experience simply because it felt like we could all turtle, and when somebody attacked an opponent, the remaining player would have a huge advantage as the other two players' armies were destroying each other. Sure, you could perhaps deside to retreat after a couple of rounds, but you would still both be set a bit back, and even worse the game would continue on for a loooong time... I actually "won" the game, but it was the hollowest victory ever as everybody could have won if they were the player not targeted in the first big war...

Other than that, it was interesting to finally play a "hex" game with "war counters" (used in a loose term). The sense of discovery when exploring the map was cool, although you could get pretty lucky - or not... Of course there is a tech that lets you peek at the chits before entering, so that mitigates it a lot. There are a lot of cool techs and units which was very cool, although a bit overwhelming in the first couple of rounds. I mean, take a look at the sheets this game provides to each player, sheesh! It's a mess and very confusing for probably the first couple of plays...

Finally, the most unique thing about the game was the sheet where you have to write down everything you buy, i.e. which units and upgrades! Because this sheet is a secret to the others - so they actually don't know which units and techs you have, which simulates "real life" (in space...) better than many other games. Sure, this method is prone to errors when people have to calculate everything and put out the correct chits etc., but at least it is unique! The fiddliness of all this, however, isn't my cup of tea, and I disliked how you had to put counters on the board with the number and which ship types you had face down, because you would often forget and have to look etc.

So, I wouldn't absolutely avoid to play it again if it was a 2p game or perhaps a 2vs2. But never again as a 3p game as it simply doesn't work...

The most enjoyable part of this game (for me) is the early exploration, and it is extremely frustrating at times due to the dice rolling.  Additionally, it is somewhat one-dimensional in the sense that it is purely a war game.  If you like war games and the idea of humans traveling in space, then this is a game worth your attention.  As for me, the one thing that somewhat diminishes the game is the lack of diplomacy.  If we meet an alien intelligence, would we really to try to kill it?  However, the game is as advertised, so read the description, watch reviews, read the forums, and decide for yourself.  The game's designer is very active in the forums, which is a major plus in my book!

Rating after playing 1 doomsday scenario solo.  Brilliant game!  This, along with Astra Titanus, will be dominating my solo playing time for a while.  I thought the bookkeeping would drive me off, but I actually found it very enjoyable to look through my tech & ship options and do some "shopping".  Doomsday scenarios are maybe not terribly realistic since you can plan your development and ship purchases knowing when the enemy is going to appear.  I can't wait to try the other solo scene and play f2f as well.

After one play (2 player) at the Basic rules my rating is an 8. I prefer to wait for more experience before tuning the rating up (or down). The game components are good and clear to use. I like the combination of counters and log entries to actually differentiate ships and technology levels. The game has simple rules (in my standards), but it's not so easy to master, at first glance. It seems there are lot of choices for players to start with.

After some more plays I really thinks it deserves an higher rating. 9 is enough until we play with the full, advanced rules.

10-1-2014 update. I've played with the full, advanced rules a few times. It's a blast. 10.

I can see why people enjoy this so much and I thought that I would be enjoying it just as much myself, but... I don't know, I'm afraid it just doesn't rub me the right way; this whole "wargame" thing it's got going on what with the hexagons and every component being a flat square and all that stuff is not something that I mind, but IMO there's no real sense of flow in the game - which I actually find to be quite contradictory on the other hand since it's actually quite easy to play and every turn is quickly dealt with. But there's still something about the game play that makes it feel like a drag, and that's a real shame because Space Empires: 4X definitely has something to it, but I guess I'm just not the right kind of guy to see the whole picture. I'd rather pull out Eclipse from my wardrobe and play that one....

This one feels fresh and innovative. I'm not sure if its the Holy Grail of 4X games, but it does have some novelty feeling.

The biggest plus is the amount of hidden information. There is a fair amount of bookkeeping, but MUCH less than a less elegant design would command. Its so cool to go into a battle after bluffing and maneuvering (and using decoys) to finally reveal your fleet make-up and surprise technology.

With this genre, I always ask myself why I'm not just playing the video game. With this one, you could make a case for that....but if you want to play a 4X boardgame this is in the top tier.

Rating for the basic ruleset.  Advanced rules will probably make the game better for me.  Still solid and want to play again.

Edit - 1/1/13 Played second session. Now with Advanced rules. Better. Going with a "10" for now. Love the secret upgrades and hidden information. Hate handling the counters though. I could imagine the game losing its shine for me after the novelty wears off, but I'm a big fan right now.

Edit - 1/5/13 yeah, the counters are a pain. Eightsville. 

Edit - 4/25/13 nah, back to Tentown. Long and "fiddly", but a great game. 

Edit - 1/29/17 a 4-er (basic rules) and several solo games (advanced rules) later = not so long and fiddly under these distinctions. Also not as exciting when solo though, obviously. The advanced rules are especially great for the surprise/bluffing that you get with raiders, fighters, scanners, and point defense. And the advanced rules don't really take up too much extra brain space. Mandatory beginning with game two. 

The Close Encounters expansion stuff definitely makes for a long and fiddly game with extra bookkeeping, and that's WITHOUT the Ground Battle rules. But it still looks entirely doable by experienced players who have a full day. The Invasion stuff, however, strikes me as solo-only OR for experienced players who can leave the game set up for two sessions. This at a glance - haven't tried. 

About to attempt first CE solo game with three AP (normal difficulty). Using all CE rules other than invasion stuff. Probably get my space ass handed to me.

2-3-17  Several solo Alien Empire games. Soon to begin a Space Amoeba solo game. Expansion material mostly makes for a better game by far. I used all of it. Liked most of it. However, I'm not sure if the ground forces stuff makes the game better for me. Remains to be seen. 

The solo game flow charts are fantastic and a real achievement, but I need to make some changes before another attempt at the alien empire games. Still too predictable, game-able, and checkered with grey areas. Others are able to whip up some common sense rulings on the spot, but I'd like to remove myself from the equation as much as possible. I want there to be chances for the aliens to target random fleets of mine and not be so single-minded, for example. None of this seems like it would be TOO tricky to implement to my personal specs. But will I get off my ass and do it?

Oh, will eventually pick up Band of Brothers based on the strength of Space Empires. I enjoy ASLSK1 after a dozen plays, but I have a feeling it isn't exactly what I want for a tactical, squad-level standard wargame.

Lots of interesting ideas and combinations in this one. Lots of ways to tweak this to your particular styles and desires.  Initially I was a bit put-off by the "spreadsheet" for my economy but it really is elegant and helps correct many "did I account for that?" moments that are lost with other ways of accounting.

This is a game that grows with you.

Well thought out and rather deep but fiddly and longish cliché sci-fi game.  The strongest aspect of the game is the balance and relative simplicity of the rules. There are some issues: like big ships being inferior to zerg fleets due to tech cost. However, overall the game is very well streamlined and balanced, which cannot be said about many popular (sci-fi) games. (rating +2) I also like the strong fog of war effect. (rating +1) Unfortunately the game is exceptionally fiddly: cramped board and tens of counters, which you have to pick up constantly because it is difficult to remember what is where. (rating -2) Also, the game is very long. Forget about the “official” play-time: it MAY be feasible for veteran players who take simultaneous turns and know the game very well but for average players the game may easily last 7+ hours. (rating -1) Finally, the game looks uninspiring and there is hardly anything original about it. I am not fan of star trek ships or old sci-fi computer games. 

The solo scenarios are OK. The doomsday machine scenarios are easier and faster but repetitive. The alien scenarios are more engaging but take much longer and require a lot of bookkeeping. I would rate the game 6 as a solo game. 

P.S. The game is advertised as 4X but the game is really about eXterminate. The eXpansion and eXploit parts  are very straightforward and do not last long. The eXploration may last somewhat longer depending on scenario.

Pure wargame, I love it. No gimmicky mechanics like the other popular attempts at 4X like Eclipse or TI3.Tech paths give you more control to mold your empire. 

Although this is not a complaint, it appears that the game rewards agression for the quick victory. If not, the game will be very long...when this happens to us, it's still a hell of fun time. If you are not accustomed to calling a draw or delcaring a winner (like us thanks to all the Eurogames) doing so might not feel right.

The game mechanics focus on pure build up and combat more then diplomacy. There are no mechanics to enforce diplomacy like Eclipse or Twilight Imperium, however, alliances are likely to will form naturally.

This is not the game for me.  While I like the flexibility and simplicity of the system, I found the book keeping annoying.  I think I would prefer to invest my time in Eclipse, Twilight Imperium, or a computer 4x game (like Sins of a Solar Empire).  Granted, I did not try all the rules and I only partially played a solitaire game.  But I'm not sure that I would want to invest any more time in this one - this genre has been done better by others.

I would say this is an 8 for what it's intended to be. However, I have to knock points off for the messy pile-of-counters system that could have been easily and neatly handled with simple numbered counters or stacking chips. I have to take off more points for the awkward, mistake prone record sheet.

There's a limit to the number of starships you can have. That makes sense for this kind of game, how does it work? It doesn't, it's completely arbitrary that you're limited to the number of counters. And it's not a limit to the number of ships or fleets, something in-game, it's an arbitrary limit to the number of counters. If you have six Scout counters (I don't recall the amount) you can have up to six groups of six Scouts each (36 Scouts), but you can't have seven individual Scouts on the board. Nor could you simply add another Scout to a half-full fleet. There's no mixing of ship types. Ships have to travel in groups of one to six ships of the exact same type.

I have never encountered another board game to so deliberately and almost maliciously stomp on your suspension of disbelief. Imagine if Axis&Allies only came with six Infantry per nation, and you could only put one chip under it with a number indicating 1-6 units, face down. Would you play that version? It's not broken, but I just can't imagine bothering to try this game again. One of my most disappointing purchases.

RATING: 8
Preliminary rating after 1 two player game short game with basic rules. The hidden units really make this game. It is long (we took 4 hours and didn't finish our two player short game) but fulfilling and full of tough choices. It is important that the players realize that giving up is a good idea once you've lost a portion of your colonies to the enemy advance (unless you hold an ace up in your sleeve). Otherwise the end game is but a meaningless drag.

RATING: 8.7
Each civilization starts exploring their own "solar" system, and builds up their economy by means of colonies on newly discovered planets, mining of mineral deposits, and merchant ship pipelines (or highways). Next you venture into the danger fraught deep space, and before you know it (well, it does take a while really) you're head to head with a hostile space fleet.
The game builds up very nicely to the point of confrontation. Lots of different ships to be built and technologies to be developed. Space looks different each time you play. It takes some bookkeeping, but sheets to do as such are included.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The amount of paperwork that this game demands far outweighs whatever benefit one is supposed to get from it.  Hidden units, some of which may not be as technologically advanced as others in your fleet, with hidden exploration zones that reveal random things that do unusual detailed things... just too much for something as tactical as this.

Decent game, a bit clunky in tracking the fleets and is lacking punch and spice. Alright but nothing new or exiting in the design.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game mechanics-wise, but lacking an interesting story arc, compared to other 4x games. Perhaps it need some event cards. Too fiddly with all the different units having different techs, depending on when they were built. I think I'd prefer the variant where technologies are retroactive to ALL your ships. Still, as an experience, I'd definitely rather play something like Clash of Cultures. 

Played once (4-player) using the updated victory conditions (gain 3 vps, rather than have to eliminate an opponent's home base). I think this is a huge improvement, and I wouldn't want to play it the "old" way.

The simple, old-school rules are promising (the designer is responsible for the simplest WWII tactical game worth playing), but the crazy, old-school playing times I'm hearing about are not.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I agree with a lot of what plenty of others have said in that there are definitely some good bits in there, but the playing time is too long and the record keeping too cumbersome.

The fog of war element contributes to the lengthy playing time, too, since you constantly have to remind yourself just what each fleet counter is once you get a bunch of them out there. It also means you have to be very trusting of your opponent's record keeping. In the future I would suggest playing the with the instant tech upgrades optional rule, as well as making shipyards and bases public information in order to mitigate the chit flipping somewhat and at least let others validate that you're not building things you shouldn't be able to build. Oh, and don't play with mines for crying out loud.

On the whole not terrible, and I could be convinced to play it again a few more times I suppose, but it's not something I'll be clamoring to play. Frankly, I think [i]Throne World[/i] is the better game, especially since it also includes ground units and ground combat.

hex and counter of a PC 4x space game. for me this combines the worst elements of the hex and counter interface with the worst of the space 4x genre. You have to keep your ships secret so this means lots of messing around with chit stacks and accidently knocking em over, and lots of piles of chits at your end of the table, very fiddly. It is essentially a game of having the biggest economy, best tech etc and bashing your foes. It does this well but not in a very interesting way. I prefer every other space conquest game i've played.

RATING: 7
[1 incomplete play] This is almost sure to exceed the listed playtime. In my one time playing, we started (3 players) with the game in shrink and nobody knowing how to play. Eight hours later, our game ended when one player conceded. Of course it would be much faster if we didn't have to punch the game and teach ourselves, but still this will be a long game.

I had a great time, though! But I'm not sure 3p will be good with this game. I made great strides in technology and built a fleet of the best warships in the universe, all while my opponents were bashing each other. I'd think with four players there would at least be two pair conflicts, but with three, if one person is left out, they'll have a real advantage. 

I must praise the rulebook to this game, which is OUTSTANDING. Even though we were in a situation I normally shun--a group teaching ourselves as we went--it was not dreadful. The rulebook was thorough, lucid, and well organized. And every time we had a question, we were able to find an answer that explicitly and definitively addressed it.  We were all impressed with the rulebook. 

There's an advanced level of the game and a bunch of possible rule variations suggested. We just played the base game, but we read through some of the options and it looked like they'd offer lots of fun twists on the game for a group that knew the main game pretty well.

I'm not dashing out to buy this because I'm not sure how much I'd continue to like it with more experience, and even more so because I'd have a hard time getting anyone to play it, and I already have even better long games that are hard to get played.  But I enjoyed my one experience with this game, and would leap at the chance to play it again.

First play left me a little unsure how much more I wanted to see.  The game followed a familiar pattern of exploration games, with a slow, predictable buildup and then a series of attacks.  The victory condition unsurprisingly led to the first weakened player becoming the target of everyone else.  I like games with pencils and bookkeeping, and SE4X does an interesting job with secret economies and technologies in a pleasant throw-back fashion.

Initially I dislike the bookkeeping. I'd prefer open tech trees. The fleets can be hidden and still give off the FOW...dislike the upgrade rules and the need for endless number counters.

I guess I thought the fleet groups were a single marker with any number of ships hidden, but sorting out each group by tech is counter-intuitive to me.

I still ordered a copy, cause there is enough to like and play semi-regular.

BTW - the open space areas are deadly and hilarious!

Tentative rating after one game. The rules and game play are very nice, but the victory condition - wipe out any player's home base - is very difficult. Our game was a learning one, but after almost five hours, we were just starting to figure out the subtleties of strategy, and nowhere near close to done. It would be nice to play more, but I don't know how easy it will be to round out a group that is willing to invest the time (which is a little sad).

The play time does seem to be an issue. If after five hours, we're still no closer to determining who's going to win, never mind having a clear frontrunner, what sets this apart from other 4X games? How is this a better choice than Twilight Imperium 3?

I love this kind of game on the computer, but wasn't sure I'd like it on the tabletop. It turned out to be OK. Admittedly, I won, so I think I need to lose a game of this before I could fully evaluate it. I say that because it does appear to have a cascading victory situation where once one player gets an edge, it's very difficult for the other player to come back. 

The math involved in combat and the economy phase is not difficult, but is a little fiddly. I think it could benefit from an app. 

I hope to get it back to the table at some point.

I like the game. It'll be fun to break out once in a while.  The whole setting up of the economic engine is a bit tedious but I can see it's appeal to some.  It takes a lot of honesty and careful accounting. If someone is not careful or dishonest, it will break the game. If everyone just develops the home systems for a while, I could see it being too even and grinding into a long game.

The hidden group type and strength is good but it's easy to forget where your own forces are. So there was a lot of checking and rechecking.  Maybe a block implementation would be better (block to represent the type sitting on a group number or something like that).  Also soon enough there are lots of counters out there, it's hard to keep track of what already moved.  Again, blocks could fix that too. (tip them down after they move)

I think I'd usually play with Instant Tech upgrades. Keeping track of individual groups would be too tedious, especially if you have groups with different movement abilities, uggh.

I can think of a few good attacker-defender scenarios that might work.  Or decaying empire vs. new empire scenario.

The initial part of the game is inevitably repetitive as all players are slowly building up their fleets.

The game ends into a battle royale where dice play a relevant role.

I know this is not a euro but all tech is predominantly about ships, while it could have been a good idea to create advances in terms of "civilization" improvement while linking victory conditions also to something else other then number of colonies built and exterminate your adversaries.

For an acceptable level of satisfaction optional rules and expansions may be required.

I've played a few times one-on-one. I really enjoyed it and would like to delve further, because I think there's a galaxy of strategic meat to explore. It definitely needs to be played with the advanced rules after a first learning game. The book keeping and generic powers didn't bother me at all....I like its clean economy and aesthetic. However, I'm not sure that my friends were particularly sold on it, which means I might not get the opportunity to give it a really good run. I probably need to look for someone local who's interested in taking the journey with me or resort to Vassal. I will say that I can't see it being a satisfying multiplayer experience and that is reflected in reports I have read....possibly 2-on-2 team play with experienced players, but that would be it.

Good effort at a space exploration and conquest game.  I was enjoying buidling and developing tech and colonies and never really got in to combat in my 3p first game.  

Blue was getting aggressive toward Yellow, and I felt bad for Yellow, so pulled back.  No sense piling on the underdog.  Besides I wanted to see if he'd pull out any surprise defenses.  Since it was a learning game, I don't think I ruined it for anyone.

There was quite a bit of book keeping.  I think with experience, it would not be too much a burden, however, I found myself to have made a few book keeping mistakes in hindsight.  Usually they were to my detriment, like forgetting to count mineral resources, or miscounting colonies, etc.

I'd like to play again and see if I can get in on the combat portion of play.  

We were all new players and we probably took 3.5-4 hours, so you'll need a clear evening.

A fairly sparse and elegant distillation of all the standard features of computer games like MOO, GalCiv, and (heh!) SE, this game provides a skeletal rule set and invites you to create your own modifications. The combat system is clean and simple, and fog-of-war with hidden counters is a major play element. The game is extremely modular, making it easy to retain some parts and change other parts. How you feel about that philosophy will probably determine your reaction, but as an inveterate tinkerer who started inventing new chess pieces at age 10, it wins my approval.

This game quickly earned a spot in my top 10, and I also think it'll stay in there for a bit. What I really like about it:

* The concise rules
* The hidden unit deployment and fog of war mechanics
* The neat tech tree
* The dangers of deep space
* The feeling of rapid colonization at the start that seamlessly transitions to open warfare

Quite awesome.

Only played this two-player & i'm kinda torn on this one.

For one i really like the modular nature & strategical possibilities on the other hand a two player game often comes down to just better logistical acumen, while a 3 or 4 player game will take much longer.

The economic phase is pretty mathy, if you add some of the optional rules it grinds down to an excel sheet battle.

Like i said i'm torn on this one.. we wanna try it with more players and speed up the start with everyone already having all their planets developed & a bunch of construction points for individualisation. Let's see how that goes.

GMT promoted this 4x game as streamlined, focused, and quick to play (for the genre)... and they were 100% accurate.

This game is smooth sailing, even multi-player solo, and the rules and tracking that seemed daunting are sensible, easy to use, and don't delay things much.

While this game is a 4x game - eXtermination required in most scenarios - it is a well-developed game, with no obvious hitches.

In my 1st 2-player solo learning game it became obvious where the game was headed; without advanced rules to juggle things around the winner was easily predicted far in advance, but still there were many things to delay the collapse and overthrow, and make things interesting for the player behind.  In fact it was only when Altairian colonies in his own system started throwing out Battle Cruisers at him evry round that Chulak choked and died.

Perhaps the hardest single thing (and not terribly difficult, mind you) was totaling the adders/subtractors for die rolls, but on the whole I cannot imagine a much simpler effort, short of Ascending Empires and flicking.

This starts at a 7 even, for a very good game, even at it's most basic introductory level.  Even though it took a few hours to play, it was fun and involving, and it should only get simpler with familiarity.

I can easily see this rating going up further if I can get it to the table.  This is really a terrificly fun space wargame.

(12/20/2015) Comment based on one play.

This is a GREAT 4X space war game, along the lines of [thing=1708][/thing] and various video games such as Reach for the Stars and Masters of Orion. It is the perfect example of the eXploration, eXploit, eXpand, and eXterminate genre, with straightforward rules and intuitive play.

One really gets the feel of running a space empire, through the sheer scope and scale. Although the "empires" are "generic", players quickly learn to identify with their own little portion of the board, slowly nurturing their fledgling exploration economy into a war machine.

Comparisons with [thing=72125][/thing] and [thing=12493][/thing] are inevitable, but SE:4X stands on its own in terms of epic-ness. Eclipse is an economic Euro, dice-rolling Ameritrash hybrid, that allows extensive customization of ships. However, the war game aspect of it is ruined with a somewhat ridiculous movement mechanism--you move individual ships, instead of stacks/fleets, and then combat occurs after everybody's finished with their turn, so it is possible to pile up a bunch of ships over a number of impulses. As for scale, it feels more like a gladiatorial-type combat between customized war machines. TI3 has an extensively fleshed out universe, with gameplay feels more like a space opera of political maneuvering for the throne, with space battles as one means to an end. Players could build up large fleets, but still win the game without firing a shot. However, combat is along the lines of Axis and Allies, where the defender has unrealistic choice of what casualties are taken. In SE:4X, grand fleet battles are the norm, deciding the fate of adjacent empires. The movement of ships/fleets feels like it should in a war game, with "fronts" and "flanks". The combat, while abstracted, feels satisfying--ship characteristics meaningfully affect the outcome, taking into account the differences on ship classes and technologies. The technology tree is primarily focused on ship size, attack, defense, tactics, and movement, along the lines of the video game Spaceward Ho! Invest progressively more resources in a tech, and you get more bonuses in combat.

The amount of bookkeeping can be intimidating, and as the number of fleets increases, keeping track of what is what can become a nightmare, much like keeping track of your legion stacks in [thing=103][/thing]. But, because the bookkeeping of one's empire is kept secret from the other players, there is a substantial "fog of war" feeling that exists in SE:4X that is missing from Eclipse and TI3; you literally do not know what your opponents' ship techs are like, until you encounter them in battle--that usually results in nasty surprises, when you realize you have inferior tech. There is a discernible level of tension, as players engage in a quiet, secret technology race. The amount of R&D spent will surely affect the outcome of battles to come.

The rules are surprisingly simple, clear, and intuitive. The components are decent. The play, however, can be quite involved, so this is not a fast playing affair due to the bookkeeping during the economic phase. This does not mean there is substantial downtime--the actual play can be quite fast with the three impulses during the movement phase. In the end, gameplay is quite enjoyable, with luck only limited to the combat die rolls and placement of random exploration chits. There is an element of economic snowball that will be determined by the placement of habitable planets--those that colonize first and colonize well will have more resources to build more ships and tech, sooner, and thus give advantage to that player. However, this seems to be the case with all space war games that have an exploratory phase. Initial rating is an "8", with room to go up with subsequent plays.

RATING: 8
This 4X space game is just a heck of a lot of fun. The system is entirely modular, so you can add or remove rules (i.e. new ship types, technology, etc). This is coupled with a mountain of different scenarios to play to make a unique challenge each time. The game is mostly focused on the expansion and combat, with nothing in the way of diplomacy. It also lacks anything like a backstory or lore, so if you're into that, look elsewhere. This is for people who can make their own ideas about their "civilization". The expansion Close Encounters, however, adds some possibilities for making more unique empires.

The game depends on players playing aggressively otherwise it can really drag on.  Played well, things can move quite quickly. It does feel like it goes through definite "phases": first all players are exploring their space independently; next there are some light encounters while people build up their fleets and explore the few remaining unexplored areas; then all exploration is done and the focus moves to conquering. I do wish some amount of exploration remained throughout the game but I'm not sure how one could accomplish that.

If you enjoy the base game at all, you should absolutely buy the expansion Close Encounters. It's probably the best expansion to any game I've ever seen.

1980's style hex-and-counter wargame, but with many unique and elegant innovations. If you don't mind the minor bookeeping this is a fantastic 4x game that quickly moves from a fun exploration and empire building game, to a ruthless wargame with lots of bluffing and second-guessing of enemy forces. My favorite 4x game to date.

Initial rating after two plays (2 and 4 players): 8
I had great expectations concerning this game. My first two plays were interesting and I see some great potential and good replayability. I have some concerns though - the playing time seems to be quite long with 4 players. With two, in case of indecisive battles the same thing can occur. Additionally the bookkeeping does not allow to fully enjoy the game. Especially upgrading the units is a pain in the ass! Next time I will play with the optional rule allowing an instant units upgrade.

I really enjoy this game.  I like the strategy and the hidden units and secret technology.  The problem is that the player count is not very high, the game is long, and the fact that each ship can have a different level of technology means there is a lot to keep track of - especially later in the game.  Also space combat can be tedious (ok this is my cruiser that has +2 defense, but this other cruiser I have only has +1, which one are you attacking?)

Initial Rating: 6.5 (October 2012)

My favorite theme in boardgames (and books) is space opera sci-fi so I had a great expectation about this game. First of all there is a lot of bookkeeping, which doesn’t bother me, but it bothers some of my friends making it difficult to hit the table. The only downside of this bookkeeping is that players can made a mistake or outright cheat because I won’t be reviewing anyone´s sheet. Second, it can take a long time to play and for what it offers, I’m not sure I’m willing to “invest” that much time playing it. My game took 4 hours and we didn’t finish it (nor we were anywhere close to finish it). This makes the game an, almost exclusively, 2 player game. Perhaps you can play shorter scenarios as opposed to utterly destroy your opponents. I didn’t read the rules so I’m not sure if there are scenarios or not. 

I don’t like to play solo so I can’t comment on that.

It has some good ideas in it, and I love the tech tree (except for the movement technologies as they don’t make thematic sense) and even like the bookkeeping. You have a plethora of tactical and strategic decisions and I like that (you can send decoys! NEAT). I also like the game mechanics but I don’t like the components. They are difficult to stack and handle, I wish they were bigger. The game board is ok and it serves well its function. Surprisingly the basic rules are fairly easy to grasp, I was expecting a much harder/complex game rules wise, but the gameplay DO have a satisfying game depth. Also I didn’t feel any downtime, it was just that, even though we played quickly, neither of us was close to destroying the other player.

The idea that you don’t automatically upgrade your ships after a technological breakthrough, has a lot of thematic sense, but I found it made our game a lot slower. This could be a good variant.

After playing this (and Eclipse), the undisputed champion of this category (for me) is still Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition. I’m willing to play Space Empires again, but something needs to be done to shorten the play time.

Current Rating: 6.0

I still want to try Space Empires again in the future, however my desire to explore it further is tempered by my memory of how long the game took without accomplishing anything of value. I don’t mind long games (in fact I love them), but with Space Empires I feel I wasted my play time without any reward. I’m downgrading its rating due to this. Perhaps I’m not Wargame material as every Wargame I have played hasn’t been fun enough (the exception could be Combat Commander but the jury is still out). It’s a shame because in theory Wargames appeal a lot to my inner gamer, but in practice I haven’t been able to enjoy them :/.

The problem I see with the game is that it is easily stalemated, a player will always have an small advantage but the game can take forever to finish. I will give it another chance to woe me, but it seems this can go further down in my personal ratings.

Current Rating: 5.0

This, frankly, was more fun than I thought it would be.  The mechanics are pretty clean and the pacing for a 2-player game felt just about right.

4X, rápido y sencillo. Mejor 1-vs-1 o 2-vs-2.

UPDATE: Siendo un buen juego, no es la revolución de los 4X de tablero que esperaba. No me parece mucho mejor que Throneworld. Tengo el ojo puesto en Eclipse.

UPDATE: Después de probar Eclipse. No tengo claro cual de los 3 juegos me gusta más. Comparten un mismo tema, pero las mecánicas son muy distintas, cada una con sus ventajas y desventajas. Las principales diferencias de Space Empires respecto los otros dos es que la información de flotas y tecnología es oculta y que las flotas no actualizan su tecnología automáticamente.

not bad game but in the end it seems that it will always bogs. When one side starts to loose it is too easy to just buy mines and stop attacker in time it takes him to bring some minesweeprs it is usually possible to recover. 

So I would like to try it without mines or make mines mor expensive - either more expensive to buy or have some rule to pay maintenance for them (1 maintenance point for 2 or 3 mines seems ok for me) this way it would be little burden to have everything in mines.

Rating six for games with mines. I can see this going up to 8 or 9 with some good house rules for them

Rating based on the two player game.  Random setup of planets and terrain (asteroids, nebula and black holes) can give one player a starting advantage in colonizing the home system planets more quickly.  This can lead to enough of an economic advantage that they can then strike early and cut off the more distant colonies of the other player.  In a two-player game, that can be decisive.

I do like the tech tree and the ability to decide which forces you build for your fleet, however, in a two-player game, the player with the advantage in colony location would be stupid to let the game go long enough for the other player to build up enough strength to take advantage of that.

A good try, but falls far short of Twilight Imperium 3rd.

For 2016 it just seems like a game shouldn't need you to take notes and do bookkeeping.  Either come up with a more elegant solution with dials or streamline unnecessary elements.  If you still insist than make a companion app.  The games best feature is solitaire play but if I'm going to play solitaire then Galactic Civilizations 3 is far deeper and does all the bookkeeping for me so I'll just play that instead.  All that said nothing in the game is a problem for me and I do like it.  I'm just not going to try to sell the idea (bookkeeping and all) to anyone else.  So find me and I'll gladly play your copy.  I just no longer need my own.

(Rating based on two plays)

I have mixed feelings about this one. It is truly epic in scale: lots of different types of units, vast space to explore and technologies to develop. On the other hand the game has none of the epic style of Twilight Imperium or Eclipse: no universe description or any kind of plot, no asymmetric races with special powers (expansions fixes that by adding special powers), no politics. The amount of counters is impressive, but it seems that there are situations during the game where players have to improvise with marking some of the things that occur. There are certainly a lot of clarifications in the version 1.1 of the rulebook, so be sure to get that. Speaking of the rulebook, it is definitely not for the rule lawyers. Many things are written informally and one needs to use some common sense.

All in all the game feels like a huge sandbox: designers are giving you some basic rules, lots of advanced and optional rules and a shit load of counters so you can shape the game the way you want it to be, not the way designers wanted it. I have doubts whether this is a well thought design, but if you're looking for a huge-scale space game in which you can immerse yourself for hours, this is probably it. I know I would have loved this game 15 years ago when I was in high school.

Components are top quality: mounted map, thick counters, sturdy box. Only the dice feel cheap.

Edit: game sold. Couldn't convince my friends to play it.

Thinking about this because of spartax' comment [comment=2716401]here[/comment].

However, it sounds like it's not-so-much recommended for three players?  (Or 3-player scenarios tend to be 2-on-1?)

This is 4X concentrated on the warfare and fleet building side, and it's one that's done pretty damn well.
Maybe it suffers a bit from a lack of theme/variability, as all the players have exactly the same units and counter mix only in different colors, but it's such a clear system that it's very easy to houserule and make your own scenarios, if you want to have variable player powers etc.
Complexity scales nicely as the optional and advanced rules are pretty modular. The pen and paper bookkeeping can feel heavy at first, but a couple plays under your belt you won't miss pushing tokens around or such.

I finally had a chance to make my first game. Unfortunately we did not have the time to play the whole game.

I will first start with the positive comments like I always do even if the game gave me a bad experience.

I think the combat system is interesting. There is a lot of details and possibilities. When writing this, I was working on a WW2 pacific game and I too was designing various ships with different stats and attack capabilities. So it felt somewhat similar.

But what kills this game is all the fiddly movement, resource management and book keeping. It's simply unplayable. I also tried to do that kind of movement in my game and I realized after the 1st play test that it cannot possibly work and that it's not playable. But it seems that the designer of Empire 4X did not have that point of view.

The rules are not that complex, it's very easy to learn and they are very similar to other games. For example, the ships have a letter to indicate in which order they attack like in Wizard Kings.

The real problem is that there is so much book keeping and tokens to manage that it takes forever to play and it is very annoying to manage.

For example, all tokens are placed face down on the board, the token themselves are not ship, they are only there to identify the number token under it. But there is worst, tech upgrade are not automatically retrofit on all your ship, so you could end up with 5 groups of cruiser that each have different combat and movement stats. And all this information needs to be written on a sheet.

Yes different movement stats which makes it a pain to move unit because you must constantly flip to look at your chits, look at your sheet of paper to know it's movement stat, look at the movement chart to see if you move a bonus hex this turn, and then move your ship. It is very annoying.

I think they should have streamlined movement. I suggested that the board could be smaller and the players could start with a random set of technologies or like 100 point to invest in tech. That would make the beginning of the game less boring and people would be able to jump in the action sooner.

There are also mineral tokens that you need to send a ship to collect the token and bring it back to the colony to get the resources. This is just annoying for nothing.

In fact, this game feels more like if you are working instead of enjoying yourself. They should have abstracted or streamlined some mechanics while still keeping some of the complexity of the combat system.

I know they tried to adapt master of orion to a board game, but there are reasons why the conversion cannot be made directly to the board game. And there are reason why I still don't have a playable prototype to adapt master of magic as a board game. You cannot simply compress the video game as a board game.

Still, I would probably willing to play space empire 4x as a video game since the computer would do all the accounting for me. It won't be my favorite game, but at least it would be playable.

I liked a good deal about this game.  The complexity level was perfect for what it was trying to achieve -- a nice balance between playability and chrome. The game is fiddly though -- I would prefer my fog of war games to use blocks rather than chits as it is easy to lose track of them and I did find keeping track of the various generations of tech on different ships a bit tedious.  The exploration, colonization etc. was fun though the end game seemed to be entering a grind phase when I conceded victory to my opponent.  I had the feeling that I could have held out for quite a while longer and would like to have seen alternate victory conditions that could have ended the game before that point.

After reading the rules, I thought that this game was going to be awesome and I was planning on buying it.  After playing though, I probably won't be getting it.  The main detractor was all the book keeping and accounting.  It was more intensive then most any other game I have played.  Aside from this main detractor the game was awesome!
If I had a regular group of serious gamers that could handle this type of accounting work, I would probably buy it still.  I have various groups I play with though, including some younger gamers and casual gamers.  I don't think this would appeal to them as much.
I do want to play it again.

RATING: 6
This was a 6 hour game, for 4 players in 2 teams, blood brothers.

The rules are simple enough, and very clear.

I liked how the explored places dynamically change one's strategy, at a reasonable pace, compared to the speed of developing an economy, developing technologies and building ships.

I stopped being very interested in the details of each combat: only the net result was of interest to me. I prefer games that move faster (Agricola, Istanbul, Race, Magic,…).

I do enjoy games more when their variety has a stronger flavor: Magic, Race for the Galaxy (different games yield very different tableaux), LibertaIia, Twilight Struggle… Even exploring the different zones of the Istanbul map has more variety for me. The flavor I am talking about is not the theme (even though theme can help): it is more like the variety of the ingredients in a dish.

Overall, I don't feel like like spending six hours on a game with no strong flavor or drama like this is best. I would prefer two Twilight Struggle, or a few Race for the Galaxy, or two Magic Commander, many of Claustrophobia, etc. Essentially, I am missing some richness in the experience, some epic epicness coming from stories or a deeper flavor.

Twenty years went into the design of this game, and it shows. The units are varied and interesting, and almost all important to strategy. The multiple and interesting technologies are also all important. The genius of the game is that sheer economic facts prevent anyone from ever attaining everything in the game--or even everything they want to get in a game. The four Xs all work well. The exploration is simple but tense. The expansion requires delicate forethought. The exploitation leads to the most difficult choices. The extermination is perfectly realized, with straightforward, logical combat. This game is worth the investment.

What a fantastic 4X game. Good hidden info, a tech tree that fits onto an 8.5x11" piece of paper (granted two-sided), and all sorts of sci-fi standards included. The first expansion (Close Encounters) really rounds it out.

Decent enough war game, with a nice sci-fi theme. Simple rules, and holds true to the 4X style. Easy to get immersed in the game, and fairly easy to pick up the rules quickly. Not bad for solitaire, but not as good as I was hoping. A poor man's Eclipse that holds it's own.

RATING: 9.7
I'm a huge fantasy gamer, but, ironically, this is one of my favorite board games.  This is the full-featured space epic that I've always wanted in board game form.  It's a pure and complete 4X experience with a heavy dose of exploration and technology advancement but is primarily a war-game (which is good).  The rules are flexible enough to create nearly any scenario you want and can be played in as little as 30 minutes or could be expanded to last weeks.

A couple minor things that bother me about the game.  First of all, the slow start which does get old after repeat plays.  I've gotten used to variant rules giving more starting resources to everyone so the war can start quicker.

Secondly, compared to Wizard Kings, there isn't much strategic decision to be made to control hexes.  It's mostly just a race to build up the biggest fleet and crush the enemy.  The first one to do that usually wins.

That being said, this is still my favorite strategy/war game because of all the options, the sheer amount of unit types, and loads of ways to play.

I really dislike the crudity of the victory conditions, which also severely impacts game play.

I love TI3.  I love Eclipse.

This game does something neither of them can do though.

This game FEELS like an actual simulator of what interplanetary warfare and exploration would feel like.  The housekeeping is minimal once you understand it, and the thematic feel of upgrading ships, of sending fleets to engage the enemy, of bombarding enemy home-worlds...

I can't say it feels realistic, because it is futuristic, but I assume this would feel realistic were we living in the not too distant future where this could all be real.

SE4x, is a fun light space wargame. I know people have complained that the original multiplayer game suffered from a poor win condition, and that may be true but as a 2 player game this thing is a ton of fun. Additionally there are variant win conditions that address the issue if you are dying to play with 3 or 4.

After 2 4P player games (basic), very fun 3 hour game.  I will wait to rate it after more plays - a tentative 9 at this point.  I am anxious to give it a big 2P go at some point.

After 3 more plays - all 2P, I am loving parts of the game.  But, the combat system is just too random - I prefer more a bell curve of predictable outcome versus the flat 'feel' here.  We've had some unreal results, just stupid stuff happen (3DN vs. 5 BC and the DNs do absolutely nothing - equal tech).  If I had more impact on the combat system and how battles played out (see Starcraft or Space Empires IV on the PC) then I would be hard-pressed to rate this less than a 10.  As it stands I will go with an 8.  That could decline with more plays with combat as it has been.

One other issue so far - seems to be a one big fleet kind of game.

[u]21-May-2013[/u]:  I've only played this one twice so far (solo), but I'm hooked.  It's an awesome game.  This rating will most definitely go up after a few more plays.  I wanted to jump in and give it a 9 right away, but I want to play it a couple more times.  This is my first experience with a 4X game and my first game that involves counters.  I'm pleased this was my initiation.

I've only played the Solitaire Doomsday Machine scenario, but I found it quite fun.  The basic game is one of space exploration and combat.  Each player has a home world and some basic ships to begin the game.  You explore the space around you discovering other planets and finding minerals, as well as Nebulae and Black Holes.  You build up your fleet and eventually try to take out your opponents.

Even though this is all done with little square counters (and a pad of paper...don't worry, it's much easier than it first appears), I definitely get the feel of moving through space and discovering new planets, increasing my technology.  I like the art on the counters, and the board is very nice despite basically being a large black piece of cardboard.

If you are interest in a 4X game and/or enjoy sci-fi games, I would definitely recommend you give this one a look.

[u]05-Aug-2013[/u]: Just a fantastic game.  Challenging.  Fun.  Creates a good narrative.  So many options still to explore.  And I've only played the solo DM scenarios so far.  Very highly recommended.

RATING: 7
4X game where players start off in different corners of space, explore the areas and mine them. Ships are built and space is further explored, repeat. Eventually civilizations will have to explore the more dangerous deeps of space and/or try to conquer the other empires to win. The game has two halves - the peaceful multi-player solitaire game: a race to build a good engine of resources and then the war (a race to get the remaining VPs needed for victory).

The game has a ton of different ships to buy and technologies that can be added to those ships. Since it uses a fog or war system it all needs to be kept track of. Ships of the same type may have different technologies on them so the spreadsheet portion of the game can get complicated. I found this kinda cool but also a bit distracting from the play of the game.

A rather formulaic game that can become epic based on the make-up of the different fleets (you don't really know what you're going up against until you're actually fighting them).

preordered 10/08/10. yea! finally here 08/24/11.

Rating based only on solitaire play so far, I thought the solitaire doomsday scenario was well done.  I lost on easy, (just barely).  Excellent rulebook (very easy to find answers).

I'm getting the feeling this is more like a 2hrs/player game which will be much too long for some but probably fine for pbem.

Update:
Played a two player small map game.  Awesome.  I really liked the importance of timing everything and how it entered the equation, a great balance must be struck.  Still wish the playtime was shorter (oh well) it's still fun, just long, unless:

*Quick Start Variant.
*-5CP to Techs.
*Short Game victory conditions.
*Instant Tech Upgrade.

Tweaked to my liking, or for solitaire scenarios, it's probably a 10.  Bonus points for great designer support.

Looking forward to the expansion and thicker counters.

A very well structured 4X game, with a rules set that enables one to start simply then add options as confidence with the system develops.

The real winner for me was the variability in scenarios. There are single player scenarios right up to multiple player scenarios featuring options for 2-8 players. An additional feature is that the scenario booklet provides options for short and long forms for the scenarios. Given I have a large gaming space, my group tends to gravitate to longer play games.

By way of final comment, the game is very easy to teach people as 3 complete turns or more will go by before interaction happens. Players can't really go wrong in this time

I expected something more in line with a wargamer's version of TI3 or Eclipse, but SE4X is a whole different beast. While it hits wargamer sensibilities, it is at the same time a very clean and simple game. Don't get fooled by its looks, it is not nearly as complex as other (supposed) 4X games out there and has one of the best written and structured rulebooks of recent memory. I am fascinated by its ability to generate stories through gameplay without any scripted events and while there are clear militant goals in the default game, a plethora of scenarios modifies the game to your playstyle, which makes it the ultimate sandbox space game and one of the only games that truly embodies the whole spectrum of the 4 X'es. A masterpiece that is only further elevated by its first expansion, Close Encounters.

Before starting my first game, I was a bit put off by the book keeping required to stay on top of your resources, maintenance, builds, and technology.  As we started playing, I didn't mind it so much and, like the rest of the sequence of play, it became second nature.  A bit old-school, but in a good way.

This game is almost unplayable. I must admit, that I've only played solo (four player game), but still there are major issues.
Prices for the various units should have been play-tested more thoroughly.
Prices for minesweepers is such that they are only worthwhile at tech lvl 2.
Mines are far too powerful.
Cruisers with exploration is too expensive since when you get the technologies with the ship, exploration is already over.
There were not enough alien tokens. There are too many colony tokens. I see a problem with the amount of 1/2 amount markers, and finally it would be nice with more miners.

I seriously hope that the game will be fixed with "Close Encounters", otherwise at the point of the expansions release, I will have a game+expansion for sale.

After playing it once again (Doomsday solo scenario), I must say that it is more acceptable, however there are many things I'd like to change and modify about the game.
The dicefest-battles are not nice, and wether I won or lost came down to wether I rolled a 3 or less.

I don't see myself ever bringing this out on gaming evenings, and I certainly do not want to play with the bookkeeping of ship-technology levels.

A more streamlined, affectable battle choices, less bookkeeping with more variation of empires would have been nice.
Sadly it seems that only a few of these issues will be addressed in "Close Encounters"

[b]Space Empires: 4X[/b]
1-4 players
[i]
Space Empires is a game in the finest tradition of 4X space games - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. Each player builds up a space empire and uses it to conquer the other players. Exploration on the mounted map is simple for players (and dangerous for their ships), revealing different space terrain that affects movement and combat.

Space Empires was developed to keep a rich theme without overcomplicated rules. The game includes carriers and fighters, mines, cloaking, a very large technology tree, fifteen ship classes, merchant shipping, colonization, mining, terraforming, bases, shipyards, black holes, warp points, and non-player aliens. Yet the rules are short and intuitive: The basic rules are 8 pages long and increase to 11 pages in length when the advanced rules are included.[/i]

Awesome solitaire scenarios with 5 levels of difficulty

Very well randomised play maps with Home and Deep Space markers containing Minerals, Warp Points, Doomsday Machines, Black Holes, Supernovas, Asteroids, Nebulas and..Danger!
You even get "Lost in Space" on occasion.
Bookkeeping is simple, combat is a hoot.

[b]Space Empires 4X[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

[i]I can see how amazing this game would be if you could find a dedicated group to play it consistently [i](this isn't a game to bring off your shelf once or twice a year)[/i]. This really feels like some of the space conquest games I grew up playing on my pc [i](the original [thing=68287][/thing] comes to mind)[/i].

I played two solo games and I didn't find the [i](solo)[/i] game compelling enough to justify the time invest needed to set up and play. I also know that my son will not be interested in learning and playing this game long term. He's always willing to learn a new game and play with me, but I know he'll be done after one play so I'm not going to invest the time in teaching him this game [i](especially since he showed 0 interest in it while I was playing solo)[/i]. I also don't have a group that would want to invest in learning/playing this game with any regularity.

If I had a time machine and could go back to my 17 year old self I'd have played this game countless times with my old group of friends, but now this kind of game doesn't fit into my lifestyle. Maybe some day...[/i]

We played the two players learning scenario: Much too early to rate the game.

Nice game, but I'm a little bit wondering about play balance due to random placement of space counters: Nice for re-playability, but in our game, I quickly felt I was going to lose,  as my opponent was always "one step ahead of me" thanks to planets in his local space closer to his home system and some luck in deep space (minerals and free technology) versus me losing three scouts in two turns there (thanks to "Danger!" counters)...

I'm also wondering about the victory conditions: In a multi player game, a weakened player will probably end being the target of the other three players, in this "race to the enemy home system"... Not very fun for the fourth player!

Victory conditions based on CP would have had the opposite effect: Everyone going against the leader, but the situation would have changed all the time, while a losing player seems just to be going to lose more here...   :-/

RATING: 6
A real throwback-to-the-80's type game, with lots of units on old fashioned chits moving around a hex board ... and the game decided by player elimination. It's ok fun moving out and exploring the system, discovering planets and building up your resource engine. Gradually the focus shifts to buying technology and with that, building bigger and better combat ships that can move faster and live longer than your opponents' can. Then move on out and kill stuff. If combat is anywhere near equal, the d10s turn it into a lottery. You want to be going in with significantly bigger forces to avoid setbacks. Everything is on an honour system - your production, your builds, what ships have what techs. Yes, read that again, every ship can have different techs depending on when they were built - it's an accountant's wet dream of a game. If you play the dumb player elimination rules, then everyone will turtle, so we went with the optional condition of settling / destroying three worlds outside our home zones. Which still led to whoever was least distracted by opponents winning. That's enough downsides to indicate that I don't see a lot of hope for this game around these parts.

Not sure how I feel about this game any more. I used to absolutely love it and each time I've played it after felt like a chore. It's a bit long and can be incredibly fiddly. The expansion helps out a bit with that as you can just move around a single fleet marker instead and keep them on a separate player board.

Still, this is one of only a couple games that has a great exploration feeling to it. A few more plays of this and I'll have a definitive rating.

Excellent game!  The four exes are not equal; as exploring, exploiting, and expanding are merely means to help you exterminate your opponents.  The game offers many paths to do that though, and every strategy seems to have an effective counter.  There is so much going on in this game, but it comes across very simple and streamlined thanks to an excellent ruleset (presented in the best rulebook I've read: clear and logical) and the pencil/paper sheets that make it a snap to keep track of your numerous fleets and their corresponding technologies.

Normally, expansions for games I love are definite purchases for me; but Space Empires 4X offers so much to explore in the base game I haven't felt inclined to go after the expansion (though I'd happily trade for it).

Bonus points for providing excellent solo game experience!

The fiddiliness of this game seems to be a turn off for my group sadly. It's definitely a good game though.  using small thin counters stacked on top of each other can make for some difficult/annoying manipulation of the pieces. Larger thicker counters and a larger board would probably have benefited this game. As it is right now, it is much easier to play this over Vassal.

To be fair, if a computer version existed that could let people LAN party a similar experience, I'd favor that over this game.

RATING: 5
A very standard light economic-wargame. There is an inherent flaw with these produce/expand/fight multi-player games, in that they usually offer no incentive to fight. There are games that have tackled this successfully: Titan has non-attritional combat (winner can get stronger); Nexus Ops offers opportunistic VPs for staging certain battles. Space Empires 4x makes no effort to tackle the problem: the victory condition of taking someone's homeworld is the worst problem. Movement is slow, the counter mix is limiting for building, and technology keeps improving, so fighting a long-way from home against someone's base is very hard. Fair enough in a two-player, but not in a multi, where some one else has just snuck in your back door.

In principle the secret information is fun - it adds a paper/scissors/stone aspect to the game. This is mainly true for the technologies, especially movement power, and the unique units (mines/raiders etc): the +1 or -1 to the die roll powers will always pretty much come out in the wash. 

The game really needs more clever scenarios: in fact calling them scenarios is a bit strong - they are just starting positions. Playing with a random set-up, and adding in VPs for killing colonies will help, but there is nothing here not done before in a similar way. If you don't have one of those games, this is an enjoyable way to while away an evening. For a faster and more enjoyable twist on the same theme, I'd take Ascending Empires anytime. Makes me reminisce fondly of Amoeba Wars which can't be a good thing ;-)

Had my first play of the game. The rule book is easy to read and after watching the tutorial on BGG it was relatively easy to jump into. 

The book keeping aspect of the game wasnt very complicated and made me feel like I was the master of my own Imperial destiny. In some ways it was reminiscent of old school pencil and paper D&D. 

Sending fleets off into space and knowing that they would probably never see the home world again was kind of cool. On the next play I may add in some of the advanced rules, but I found once the game got going it was simple to learn, but hard to master. I also enjoyed the randomness of the board that the space counters created.

Overall I echo what other people say about this game. It's fast to get the concets down, but I agree that reading the rules, watching the video and then playing the small two player game is the way to go. 

As fr length of game play we played the small 2 player scenario and called it after 15 economic turns and about 4 hours of play after a clear victor emerged. I also recommend being aggressive and fighting your opponent with the fleet you have, not the fleet you want have.

--Feb2012-- Only six months on the shelf before the first play; I guess that's not too bad.  After a first play, it seems the game is interesting but not perfectly compelling:  there's a lovely buildup to the Final Conflict; but the ending doesn't hold the same epic feel as the preceding activity.  It's nowhere near the letdown that the ending of the most recent _Sid Meier's Civilization_ is; but it doesn't quite justify the setup.  Of course, further play might educate me to some of the subtleties that weren't immediately apparent - or, equally, demonstrate that there weren't any such finer points.

Rather bland space wargame. You discover planets, build fleets, develop technologies, have battles, but there's no real flavour to it. In particular I miss an interesting economic system.

The rules are simple and work quite well. We played with the optional rule of automatically upgrading old fleets with new technologies. I can only imagine the bookkeeping with the standard game to be tiresome. Too much information is secret, however, so if a player makes a game-changing error in calculating their production points, no one will notice. 

The game isn't much good with two players: once one player is ahead, you might as well call the game. As I imagine the three-player version has all the problems of three-player wargames, I imagine you have to play this with four.

Basically, I'd much rather play Eclipse over this.

I really, really like Space Empires - I like all the old skool elements (the chits really resonate with me from the chits in various sf themed pocket games I played back in the 1980s), I enjoy the economic planning and like having the record sheet as a record of the game. Combat is just great.

But... I think I would ultimately have preferred it as a 2player only game, and as a block game. The chits are damn fiddly. That's not enough to turn me off the game - and if I found multiple opponenents willing to commit to a game then the possibility for more players is worth having.

The game really realizes its potential with the expansion. The solo options are solid if you are looking for that. And the system is open to house rules and modifications if you are that way inclined. I think it is the best empire-building space exploration and combat out there, and a welcome throwback to the very best 1980s game design ethics (which are pretty solid, and by no means rendered obsolete in the 21st century).

This is my first space board game and I really like the way the game flows from turn to turn with 3 turns before the typical 'end of turn' actions to possibly exploit a situation or technology advancement.  I also like the fog of war aspect with the secret economic phase and hidden units.  There is a good variety of strategies to employ because of the different technology trees one could invest in.

The game has great potential with expansions for cool themes for the different factions.  I also like the scenario options for different game lengths depending on your desires or time to play. 

There are a couple drawbacks, one big one is the beginning is nothing more than multi-player solitaire while you build up your 'empire' which is not a bad thing but does take some time to play through. The other is the game may take a long time to play and the time reward may not be there.  More playings are needed to decide that.
 
This may end up being an 'in the mood' type game, meaning when I get the sci-fi itch rather than a game I would choose over others in my collection.

This game presses a lot of my happy buttons- the exploration, the secret science investment, the colonization, the eventual large ship-on-ship battles.

I haven't rated it higher because I think it has 2 problems:
1) When 2 empires fight, the third person wins.
2) When 2 empires fight, it usually devolves into both sides repeatedly hitting each other and not really getting much of an advantages.

I've only played it a few times, and haven't spent a lot of time with  the advanced rules (fighters and cloaking and stuff), so that might fix things.

Fun, straightforward game which is saddled with some unnecessary bookkeeping issues.  Rating might change with a few further plays.

I have only played the basic game with the modified (shortened) victory conditions and the faster start rules so far.

The victory conditions, both modified and original, make for a weak game with odd incentives.  The original victory conditions seem to penalize the player that strikes first, leaving that player or his target weakened to a strike by a player that conserves his forces to move in as a spoiler.  The shortened victory conditions makes players throw forces into all out attacks to achieve the final victory point of three.  The winner might not have much fleet left at all afterwards, so the victory seems strange at that point.

It should be a good engine for creating wargame scenarios in space though.

Excellent game!
A great hex and counter game that provides tons of options in the core box.
There is plenty of replayability in its three solo scenarios - Doomsday machines: Small map, Doomsday machines: large map and Alien Empire. 
Each has five levels of difficulty and you can use all the optional rules and units in all of them, mixing and matching. 

Definitely plenty of variety for the solo player straight from the box, with even more options for scenarios if you obtain the expansions. 

You can try the two player co-op scenario from Close encounters.
This is done two-handed and the easy mode is probably too easy when one person plays both factions, so start on normal.

Resource-building, ship building, smack your opponent space game. 

Butt-ugly counters and boards don't help a game that's heavy on record-keeping (oops, I made a mistake and accidentally built an extra destroyer two turns ago...oh well.)

Scenarios, solitaire version and black holes make the game fun. Doomsday machines? Not so much so.

This game is begging for Ameritrash FFG treatment with better chits and a better way to record information. iPad app anyone?

4/2016: quickly turning into an all-time fave. lots of great game in the box. i think of this game more like a toolbox of epic space opera and fleet battles. theme and imagination are mostly up to you. it provides a fertile galaxy for vivid narrative. It's a bit like ASL in that it delivers a completely immersive experience in such a little box.

the chrome add-ons don't add much more complexity. Think of the advanced rules for A House Divided; This is fundamentally a low-complexity game (just with lots of moving parts). the options add that much more richness. And there are plenty of cool things like Doomsday Machines that can dynamically alter the space-map's landscape as turns play out. (Oh, and did I tell you that players can manipulate those Doomsday Machines in their favor? Little wrinkles like that -- straight genius.)

Lastly the book-keeping aspect is simple and incorporated in a way that clearly had ease-of-use in mind. It has actually become my favorite part of the game, as you imagine each galactic civilization's struggle to govern their societal resources in times of war and the peace between massive fleet battles.

This is the space-opera/epic wargame I've always wanted.

The bookkeeping looks intimidating, but it's not that bad after a couple of turns. The game is actually surprisingly playable and really captures the feeling of exploration and conflict in an epic "space opera" setting. It’s long though. Expect to invest several hours. I like how there are different strategies to explore and lots of chrome, e.g. different ship designs and rules for black holes. The way players develop their tech and ships in secret is a very nice feature. It takes me back to playing Starfire Empires in high school. We would have loved this game back then, and I feel the same way now, 35 years later!

This was a lot of fun! A great little old-school space combat/exploration game with a lot going for it. We played with the full four players. The rules for doomsday machines, aliens, ship upgrades, hidden fleets, and more all made the game an interesting one. It is different enough from TI3 that I am glad I own this. They really are two very different experiences. I also enjoy the paperwork in the game (there is the option to play without it). Can't wait to get some more plays in for this one.

Chose this as my first venture into 4X games, and I don't regret it. I dislike the genre, though, and not looking forward to more.

Pros:
- I liked the exploration aspect in this game.
- No verbose cards to read.
- No attempt at shoving theme down your throat.

Cons:
- The "honour system" is a weakness in design. For a game with so many rules, people will make honest mistakes that will never be caught, because they're done in private. And let's not even talk about cheaters...
- Game can go on for a very long time.
- Extermination is the only goal. No other victory conditions.

RATING: 9.5
Arrived 8/25/11. several plays, very fun.  Amazingly easy to learn (rule wise, strategy is a bit more difficult). Among the clearest rulebook I have seen.  Look forward to many more plays.  Hidden information gives great tension.
There is a lot of fun in the cat and mouse, rock paper scissors parts of the game.  

I really love this game,  would play it any time. I could not see myself turning down an opportunity to play.  The only problem is time... it takes too long. Have yet to try the fast play options.    

Edit:  Fast play options are good. I especially like fast start stuff, more so that the alternative victory conditions.  Also speed has become less of an issue now that I play a bit more aggressively.

8 - Initial rating after 1 solo play.  The 4x aspect of this game comes across well.  Sometimes you find something good, sometimes your ship gets blow up.  And then you meet the enemy :)  Could be my 2nd favorite solo game, but probably 3rd after Mage Knight and Pathfinder ACG.

Lowering my rating from 8 -> 5.  THIS IS A SOLO RATING ONLY.  After about a handful of plays on the doomsday scenario, it feels tapped out.  Sadly, the Alien Encounter scenario requires too much AI maintenance for my taste.  I like the idea of this game, but it's not going to get played head-2-head with my family, and as a solo, it's a bust for me.

Really tired of GMT shipping practices. Because my last name starts with an 'R' I can always guarantee to receive shipment 2 weeks after notice first gets posted of people getting their copies...and sometimes just a week before stores ship. FFP ships in the order preorders are taken as seems to be the norm. I love to support the 500 plan they have in place but this may be my last order from them.

RATING: 3
Just not all that great. I mean, the ideas are awesome, hidden tech tree, fog of war bluffing mechanic, lots of different kinds of ships and stuff to explore, but ultimately the game boils down to this: there is an initial race to get a leg up on the tech tree. If someone can do this and then execute that advantage quickly enough, they will win. But if they fail to take advantage and the opponent can react, then it drags out into a lengthy war of attrition with a "I win a little, he wins a little", and ultimately, it's just not that fun. Play Eclipse instead, where there is a much nice boundary on who gets to win.

RATING: 8
Provisional rating after one 2-player game using the fast play scenario and basic rules set.

Well written, streamlined rules that can be scaled up or down in complexity and then applied to various scenarios make for a relatively easy to learn game that still possesses deep strategy and mountains of re-playability. 

The game also plays relatively quickly (for a GMT game) with many turns being able to be carried out simultaneously between players. In this regard, I would hope that future expansions develop the game in the way of exploration, not simply extermination. More complexity in the way of encounters with various terrain would be awesome.

As it stands, this game does exactly what it sets out to. It's a 'quick' space themed game where players race to explore space and develop their colonies whilst trying to take out their opponents. The emphasis lays in the annihilating, and people should not mistake this game for anything other than that. I was vaguely reminded of Starcraft or even Warcraft, in terms of the aim not being to build pretty settlements.

RATING: 5.5
Ok "4x" space themed game, but I find it to be slow going. I would like it much better if there was a mechanic that either gave players incentive for attacking each other, or if it had a timer mechanism that indicated the end-of-game. I also dislike paper book-keeping aspect (for real...tracking ship characteristics and income with paper & pen). To me, Eclipse is a much superior game.

It's an interesting game, but it doesn't quite work for my situation.  It's eminently unsuitable for solo play; it's not a big hit with my primary gaming opponents, and it seems to be weaker with 3 or 4 players.  Somehow it doesn't give the epic feeling I want from a 4x game.

Very fiddly game.  It extracts where other games detail and details where other games abstract.  You become very attached to your ships though.  Maybe more than in any other similar game, which is cool.  It feels as if it came out of the 1980s and can feel clunky at times.  But despite this it is really pretty good.  Gives me a Space 4x experience that is more epic than Eclipse, so I can scratch the TI3 itch with 2 or 3 players.  That's it purpose for me.

RATING: N/A
I have to say that this is the best board game version of the 4X space genre' that I've yet to encounter!  The rules are concise, but deep, and really do promote the feeling that you are exploring, expanding, exploiting the resources you discover and exterminating your enemies.

RATING: 7
I only played part of one 2-player game.  Both of us were learning the rules as we went (and we needed to punch all the chits), so we didn't finish (in roughly 3.5 hrs).  What I saw of the game so far has intrigued me, and I'd like to play again soon.  

My rating (currently an 8.5) may change significantly as we correct some of the rules errors that we made.  Since our errors speeded the game considerably (using non combat ships to explore and unintentionally using the instant upgrade variant) it may turn out that playing time is much longer than I ever have available.

I'm not sure what my final rating will be, but my first experience has me optimistic.  I like the economics and the hidden tech/military capabilities.  If my rating drops I'm guessing that it won't be due to playing time - I believe that play time can be controlled through scenario choice and simultaneous (early game) movement - it will be that the game may be too dependant on dice rolling (which is a pet peeve of mine).  Of course, in real life inferior forces defeat superior forces occasionally, but in a strategy game this often irks me.  If my rating goes up it will be because the optional rules increase the variability and more greatly reward the player with the better strategy.  We'll see...

I've now reduced my rating to 7.0 which may be a little too high.  I like the game but the last one I played (2-player normal set-up) went 6 hrs and we couldn't really agree who would have won (had we finished).  That's pretty frustrating.  I'll probably give it another chance but it may be a while.

Not much theme.  There are no different races to play, and all the ships are the same for each faction.  Play is OK.  More time is spent exploring and building your empire than actually fighting between empires.  There are a few decisive battles which seem to end the game.  There are a ton of choices to make in developing technologies and ships.  Game suffers from a kingmaking issue with 3 players, sweet spot should be four.  The components are fair.  Game has a mounted board and cardboard chits which aren't all that much to look at.  However, the game should have included shields to help keep all your secret info secret!  The rule book is a bit wordy and not clear on some aspects.  The turn sequence is not intuitive and could be better.  Game time is very long for what this game has to offer.

RATING: 4
The solitaire 'Doomsday Machine' scenario is a great addition to the game, and an excellent learning tool. 

After the initial rush, unfortunately the fun fades really fast here. In theory, replayability is almost limitless, but in reality no one I know wants to play it anymore because it feels more like work than fun, and also takes way too long to play. Not to mention other players making mistakes which screw-up the session (sigh).

Overall SE is just too fiddly and too tedious and too long, so this one has been eclipsed by Eclipse for multi-player sessions. The only reason I am keeping this game is for its value as an infrequent solitaire exercise.

Still like it despite having a right old mare with the dice in my first face to face.

I couldn't roll under a 5 to save my life. I think I must have had 3 rolls in 20 under a 5. Of course it cost me dearly. Trouble is it's very hard to prevent that sort of thing from happening.

I still liked the idea of not knowing what you where facing until it hit you.

Space-based 4X game - more of a wargame than something like TI3. I enjoyed the system, but the game is very fiddly.  I didn't mind the spreadsheet for tracking resources, but having each ship with different upgrades depending on when it was built (and with all the ships hidden) meant most of my time was spent flipping counters secretly to work out what ships were where.  Fun, but probably too much effort to seek out again (my wrists hurt by the end).

Played a 4p game, and it was amazing!  It took us about 8 hours, including set up and going over some rules for clarity in the beginning.  We were all brand new to the game, and watched a couple rules videos in the days before the game.  It was an overall fantastic experience, and all of us loved it despite having never played a true war game outside of Risk.  9/10, will play again, probably going to end up rating this a 10 some day if I can get the game time down to 4 hours for a 4p game.

Space Empires is a perfect introduction to the world of 4X. The play length can be kept quite short with 2 players. I really like the sheer number of options included in the rules set- the designer has made the game very customisable. Offensive play will usually win the day- I like that a lot.

RATING: 3
This based on only two play, however I am unlikely to play a third - hence the 3 rating.

There is just too little game and it's far too fidly. Larger map and blocks may have helped, but blocks would no doubt have pushed up the costs.

The two games I played, played out the same way, explore you're bit of space, build up your economy, explore deeper space and wait for someone to pull the trigger.

It had some interest but it's too fidly having to constantly keep looking under your counters to remind yourself what's where, especially as some groups of the same ship type will have different tech levels

RATING: 8
Great Sci-Fi game. Rules are written fairly well. I just had some minor gripes the way things were worded. Advanced and optional rules will add even more depth to the game play. Very well done. A lot of book keeping during turns may deter some, but it can be done simultaneously with everyone. I also think that the book keeping element truly keeps this game from shining. Game length should also be taken into consideration as the bigger mapped scenarios can take several hours to play.

RATING: 8
Probably the tightest new wargame design I've seen in several years. The rules are concise, consistent, and quickly get out of your way so that you can think strategically, yet they still provide great sci-fi feel. Even playing just the basic rules is perfectly fine, and that option along with the variety of sizes in scenarios makes it easy to adapt the game to different lengths, styles, or player counts.

This should be a no-brainer of a purchase for anyone interested in a sci-fi wargame. The "wargame" part is important, though - this is very much a combat-centered game, with just enough economy, tech, and development to support that combat. If you want something with more story, politics, flashy components, and all-around chrome, then TI3 or Eclipse will be more suitable. SE4X doesn't compete in that niche and doesn't try to.

Rating an 8 for now after several 2p plays, but that could increase in the future.

I like this game. I don't love it, for reasons I don't yet understand, but I do like playing it quite a bit. Unfortunately, the length of the game and its heaviness mean I don't get to play it very often. I was not blown away by the solo doomsday machine scenario, but I want to try the alien solo scenario before I pass judgement on the solo side of the game.

I'm interested in the expansion, as I hear it offers increased solo fun, but I don't enjoy the base game enough to have spent the money on an expansion I'm not sure will be worth it. Maybe someday...

Space Empires: 4X is minimalist in it's theme, components, and board but the strength of it's mechanics shines through as one of the most impressive 4x games I've ever played. Despite the long playtime the 3 rounds of board actions which are then broken up by the economic stuff really helps make the game feel like a lot is going on and despite the math you need to do the pads they give you provide a simple addition and subtraction box for everything you'd either gain or spend. 

Honestly if my friend didn't love GMT games I doubt I would have ever played this game but I'm extremely glad I did. Space empires is an amazing game that looks like an overly complicated game from the 80's but smart design choices have kept the actual bookkeeping to a minimum and keeps you focused on the action.

A little too long and too much dice for my taste, but very well designed.

The theme is great, the balance between units is pretty good.  The technology choices are agonizing, and the thrill of exploring are all excellent. 

One of the units that really adds to the feel of massive empires is the merchant ship pipelines, which let you move units through your empire much faster than opponents.

EDIT: I just became aware of the solo scenarios.  When I initially rated this, I don't think they existed.  I'm really excited about trying them at some point.

Pros:
-Very little downtime.
-The hidden fleet system

-I find the lack of theme disturbing.
-Chits are hard to handle so they stay hidden.
-Whole gameplay is built on honesty, no way to check for cheaters during the game and very hard after the game. Despite not being a problem in our game I will be picky with play company.
-Random exploration can tip the scale in one players favor.

Great old school space combat.  It works really well at both 2 and 3 player counts. expansion makes this game more interesting to me. I'd rate this an 8 without the expansion.

One play, using several short game variants. I can play Starcraft on my computer, or I can play it on a board and do all the tracking work without the aid of a computer, as well as wait for the other players to take their turns? Okay, that's an oversimplification, but it captures my feeling about the game pretty accurately. I don't even like RTS 4x games that much in the first place, and this game doesn't do the genre any favors. Perhaps the longer game would be better, but I'm not sure the increased playtime would be justified. This game might have cut the mustard back in the 70s or 80s, but it is terribly outdated and slow at this point.

This comment probably betrays the fact that I'm not really a wargamer, but I found this a bit tedious to play. It seems to try and copy the concept of individual unit upgrades from 4X video games like Master of Orion. Unfortunately this results in way more bookkeeping than I'm ever willing to do in a game.

I never thought I'd be playing a board game solo....until Space Empires. Really great hexagonal space combat/exploration game. You'll be doing some very minimal paperwork, but it makes everything easy to keep track of. The pieces kinda suck too, lots of small counters. But once you get past the physical limitations, you're basically playing the best space RTS ever. There's a lot of secret technology and ship building, so it's pretty cool when you meet your opponent and get to reveal what you've been working on.

only played solitaire. But the experience was rewarding,despite the bookeeping required.In solitaire modes the game creates stories.
Judging from the feel that the game left me, I think that with human opponents the game will show his true potential.

Excellent and deep 4x game, that actually feels like the real mc coy. As a downside, logistics tend to be a bit heavy. Well, I suppose there should be some games with auditors as target audiences :)

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Brilliant sci-fi wargame! SE:4X is all about deep space colonization that evolves into open galactic warfare. There are a lot of depth, flavor and chrome in the game. It features hidden unit deployment and fog of war mechanics as well as a cool tech tree. The rules are very concise and intuitive. The game comes with PvP, co-op, and solitaire scenarios.

I really have mixed feeling on this one. On the one hand I enjoyed playing it and I thought about the game after I played it which to me is the sign of a good game. On the other hand though the tracking of your units is difficult as is all the accounting that is needed in the game. I can see where there would be far too many opportunites for players to make inadvertant mistakes as there is virtually no way to check what players are doing. That and the rulebook is extremely poorly written.

RATING: 8
In my opinion, the game makes you feel the 4x's it promises. The rules are simple, there's not as much book-keeping as people says. You can see how your fleet grows and the deep space is discovered. May be a bit long because get to that point takes time but the results are worth it.

RATING: 5
This is an old-school, wargame style take on the Space Civ genre. It is streamlined very nicely and manages to add a lot of chrome and depth without too much in the way of rules overhead. That being said, it does require pen and paper book keeping which feels very weird from a modern game perspective.

It's not really that overwhelming and I did enjoy playing it, but to be honest I don't see a whole lot of reason not to just play Eclipse instead. It has the same 4X engine, a similar combat model and there is zero paperwork. Playing this seems like going out of your way just for the sake of doing more work.

Have a set of counters. Printed off all the print and play resources available. And the 5er map on BGG. That is how I play, until the P500 hits. In essence, I have made my own copy while I impatiently wait.

With learning the rule so far, this is a masterpiece of a game. YES, you keep track with pen and paper. BUT, it's not as space occupying (Fiddly) as cards and more counters and recessed player mats or whatever is all the rage with the kids/FFG/SM/etc. today.

Signed up for the P500 - 3rd printing.

This is the game Twilight Imperium 3 wishes it could have been.  Each race begins the same, but each player's decisions dictate the future course of the race.  Excellent game design in a package that can be played in 2-4 hours.

EDIT:  Raised this to a 9.  I am really enjoying the alternative victory conditions.  Being able to win on points or go for the throat is a great decision, and adds strategic considerations that many other games do not have.

I did a lot of research on this game prior to buying it.  It seemed like the perfect game for me.  I now have one play under my belt and I am very impressed. The 4X feel really comes through, the rules are fairly straight forward, I felt it was very thematic, and there were a ton of very important decisions to make.  I have a few small complaints:  the art work is not my style.  The game feels slightly bland in that regard. The counters, at least for a new player, can be a little hard to manage and keep track of.  And finally, I would have liked it if the base game came with special powers for each faction. I know an expansion addresses this, and there is also something to be said about all of the opponents starting on equal footing... but there is just something I enjoy thematically about race-specific powers.  

Right now, I am very pleased with the game and I hope to play it again soon.  I will report back when I have some more experience.

Unwieldy behemoth straight out of the '80s.
And although there's nothing really new here, it all works; but the atrociously heavy bookkeeping sinks the whole game. I felt more like a space clerk than a space explorer. 
Plus, I don't see a four-player game taking less than six hours. Way too much for me, especially considering the game's main flaw (but then, most games designed 20 years ago had that problem): the object of the game is to eliminate one player. What's to prevent the same guy from being picked on by everyone else?

Sigh. I still haven't found my darling of a space game.

RATING: 9
An excellent game, but one that doesn't get as much play as it deserves due to setup and playing time.  One of the few games where a phone app feels like a must: something to do the number crunching to speed up the Economic phase (or to run the Alien player in solo play) would push this up to a ten and see it getting much more play.  Still, a lot to love, especially in the hidden build-up of technology and forces, and the joyful reveal when you first enter combat.

very nice game. Can't wait for the upcoming expansion.
if you like games like twilight impirium then this is one you should try. 
the big advantage is you don't need 6 players to play it. :-)
takes also less time then twilight, however did not yet test it with 4 players, might increase the playtime, but do not let this stop you from playing it.

Hex and counter space empire war game with tons of markers for ship classes, tech tree and star and planetary systems relying on pencil and paper tabular tracking of resources, economics, and ship upgrades.  Eliminate your opponents home worlds for victory.  I like the secret unit deployment by sandwiching the unit marker underneath the ship.  Rules are simple and clean.  I like the rich thematic variety of things to encounter and how they interact.  I am not a war gamer so this is too many reference tables and paper and pencil tabulating for me.

I really like Eclipse... so I wasn't sure I needed another epic space game... but 4X plays much better with few players and while it is still a battle of economies and ships the further simplified economy and huge amount of hidden information make this feel a lot different.

So far I've only played one learning game but expect my rating will likely rise as we add in some of the advanced stuff and get a better feel for what the game has to offer.

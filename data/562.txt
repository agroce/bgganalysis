RATING: 8.5
Beautiful, under-rated game with some interesting mechanisms. Sort of a 'take that' element thrown in with a supply and demand economic mechanism. Each player mines for gems in 4 colors to fill contracts to earn points. Players control regular miners and two special miners. The number of gems mined on a given turn set the value of each gem.  The special miners (silver dwarf and shadow dwarf) allow you to perform neat special actions. The silver dwarf helps you while the shadow dwarf hinders your opponents. These are very well balanced and add a great deal to what would otherwise be a fairly dry economic manipulation game. The interplay of fulfilling of contracts with the supply and demand mechanic and the special abilities of the special miners works very well together giving the player plenty to think about on their turn. You have to juggle the special actions, contracts and gem valuation since they all can give you points. Solid mid weight game.

Here's a suggested variation. Change the value of the 120 contracts to 100 to decrease their impact, which can be significant with inexperienced players. With experienced players, leave the values at 120. With a couple of games under your belt you should be able to figure out how to limit the value of these tiles.

This is a pretty evil game, with your best-laid plans being thwarted by your foes at every turn.  It doesn't feel as bad, though, since everybody's going to get the nasty at some point.  Pretty easy to smack down the leader if you try.  Good fun.

RATING: 6
Some quite clever things here, like the number of dwarves mining a gem determining its value and some interesting combinations of dwarf actions.  However, the game is very chaotic with opportunities for kingmaking (both deliberate and inadvertent).  Gameplay is also quite repetitive.  I will certainly use one or another variant for shortening the game when I next play.

An economic game of set collection.  Good but not great.  Secretly & simultaneously players select actions in order to collect gems, spend gems (a.k.a. fulfill orders) to get victory points, and/or choose actions to interfere with opponents.  Luck heavy in terms of the Job Cards (especially since there are only 2 slots for public cards during most of the game).  Probably better with 4 players.  Reminds me of Bazaar & Basari, but it has substantially more player interaction than both of those games.  Also, it offers more tense moments and tough choices than those games (because of the options afforded by the shadow/silver dwarf actions).  I like that the Job Cards are "ticking time-bombs" that drop in value each round and will cost you points after 5 rounds (or less) of sitting in front of you.  The "feast or famine" nature of the gem prices is also appealing --> players have some control over gem prices, and if they (as a group) only allocate one or two plain dwarves to mining green gems, the green gems will be expensive that round.  ** I need to try the variant where all Job Cards are public. **

Interesting business game - with opportunities to bash your opponents with the shadow dwarf. Definitely better with the rule changes suggested (120 contracts worth 100 and bonus 15 for public contracts). I think it works quite well with 2.

RATING: 6
Kind of a neat game of collecting sets of gems for money, with an added market system where you can try to buy low and sell high for money as well.

The one odd thing that really stuck out is that it is very easy to collect all of the same color of gem, but the most valuable sets to cash in are the sets of all one color.  The reason that it is so easy to collect a ton of one color is that the market is sort of bass ackwards.  Basically, you have 4 guys you send out every turn to mine gems.  The more guys mining a color, the lower that color's price is for that round.  You also have two additional guys who do other special things.  One option that you can take with these 2 guys is to buy gems.  So, lets say I mine 4 yellow gems with my miners, and also buy yellow gems.  I have just lowered the price for myself, and if anyone else also chooses to mine yellow gems, the price is even lower.  As you can see, it's very easy to stock up on all the same color very cheaply, but the game rewards you more for doing this than if you collect a little bit of all 4 colors, which is actually a more difficult and time-consuming task.

Even so, I sort of enjoyed this game for some reason.  It could be really good if the markets made a little more sense and the trade-ins for sets were a little more balanced.  As it is, it was still entertaining enough but left me with some questions.

My first play was kind of disappointing.  I was expecting to like this more.  Second play was more engaging for me.  I think luck of the draw on the contracts has a little too much to do with this to be a winner, but something I'm more likely to play again, now.

Neat game for up to 4 players.  Silberzwerg has cool game mechanisms, a bidding "behind a cardboard curtain" process and a great mechanism for supply/demand.  Players can thwart other players through various actions.  This is a fun, thinkers game and a game of out foxing your opponents.

A game about sending your dwarvish faction into the mines to accomplish different goals.  Dwarves are assigned roles - mining coloured gems, while 2 "super" dwarves can do more powerful stuff - buy/sell/mess with the other players, etc.  The idea is make money via collecting gems in different colour combinations to complete contracts.  Contracts equals money (= victory points).  An interesting game, rather mathematical, with some nicely tuned mechanics that ensures different strategies can win.  Slightly flawed - the 8 gem-of-the-same-colour tiles seem to be overvalued, and favors those who are lucky enough to draw them as their job.

RATING: 6
Played once with three players and it seemed as if that number was a disservice for Silver Dwarf. At the core you'll find a game that is all about understanding what your opponents are trying to do, and to exploit what they're doing at times, and prevent them from doing what they want to do at other times. I'd try this again in the future, but only at four. My biggest conclusion is that this game reminded me only slightly of Basari, but at this point I think I appreciate the simplicity of Basari.

A curious beast. A mix of planning and timing, with some sniping at others and self protection. The simple mechanisms allow for a variety of strategies to achieve your score, but the german text on the players' cards doesn't help. Interesting, but I only played it as a 2-player game (quick and easy) but maybe with more players, it takes longer and is harder. ** Playe again today - I coulda sworn I never played this. The entire game/rules had totally left my consciousness!! Which I think says something. Still, it was fun, but Mike won by a mile having drawn three 120 dollar cards early on. I think this game has potential for a re-working. The dwarf actions were very interesting, the good/bad balance was interesting, the price mechanism was interesting, the bonus actions didn't work out at all, and there was way to much cash in the game. Some editing could make this a very tight game.

Played just once, with three players.  There seems to be a very good game lurking in here somewhere, one which might be revealed with some tweaking.  With the game as presented, the players' choices are too limited and the luck of the draw plays too large a part.  I would like to try a couple changes.  First, allow each player one additional shadow/silver dwarf each turn, with the restriction that a player may not play three shadows or three silvers.  Second, eliminate the huge imbalance in the job cards.  Three ideas on how to do that:  make all jobs public, or make each of the private jobs available to two players instead of just one, or give each player a stacked "private jobs" deck so that everyone's on equal footing.

Great layout and a nice game with bluffing elements. Wouldn´t recommend this as a 2 player game, but with 3 or 4 players this can be a fun and evil game.

Evil, backstabbing fun. When I got the game and read the rules I thought..."Oh no a game where you can target a player and smack him around. This won't get played". But I was wrong. Where in other games people tended to take things personally this one everyone seems to take the shots in stride and even make threats towards their nemesis. A smartly done game that provides us with some laughs along the way.

RATING: 4
Kind of a mess. Bunch of not very exciting and partly very crudely designed mechanisms are thrown into a game that is wayyyyy too long for its own good. Things are not helped by the fact that you can get anything from 40 to 120 points by filling orders which are almost exactly equally difficult - draw 40s and watch others win. Silberzwerg would've benefitted greatly from added testing and streamlining.

Interesting game of simultaneous action selection and economics.  Not as much of a classic as Hoity Toity, but introduces more choices--not sure they are all meaningful choices.  Also, this game bears use of house rules as suggested by many, otherwise luck of the job draw seems too important.  I haven't tried the Bruno rules, but will the next time I play.  Decreases the top job value to 100 and adds 15 to the public jobs' value.  The shorter game rules are a good idea I think when first learning as well.

The hidden action selection, with the possibility for take-that actions, creates some interesting bluff/double-guessing moments. The random draw of jewellery cards plays too big a part in the outcome of the game though.

RATING: 5
First impression: It feels at first a game with a mix of nice mechanics. Truth is there are some fundamental issues. If you happen to get nice private jobs you can focus on doing them and other players can't interfere too much. If you don't get nice ones you can try to do public jobs but someone else could get to do that before you and your plans fail and you'll get nothing but penalty from not doing you private job. Some options you have in planning phase aren't that useful really and only give illusion of many possibilities. Game is also too long for what it gives. Not very bad but I'll pass it next time.

We just got this game and were anxious to play it. We played two four player games. The first was with the stock rules, and the second with Bruno's two suggestions regarding raising the value of public contracts by 15, and reducing the monocoloured contracts to 100. The latter game worked well, as their was more intense competition all around. I suggest these improvements wholeheartedly. This really is a neat game. Thanks to the guys who posted the graphcal translations!

It's not a bad little game, but not one that's inspired further play. Probably the reason for that is that it's just a little too repetitive and chaotic to get the nod over all the other cutesy economic games on the shelf. I'd play it again, but I won't be the one requesting it.

This game was so hard to get on to the table.  I'm talking years here.  I'm so pleased at the result, and still disappointed that it didn't get a fair shake until recently.  This is a pretty straight forward economic fulfilment game, but it includes a great sense of urgency as the values of purchases start winding themselves down.  I love the special powers that you gain and while there is certainly a higher level of chaos and screwage here than in other games, you can usually play safer odds or push your way to a reckless lead.

I encourage the use of the +15 bonus to the center open tiles and a starting value of 100 for for the single color tiles.

Another well-done German game offering so many alternatives that you have to narrow down on each turn.  The theme didn't strike me and the rules were a bit different, but after a couple rounds I really got into it.  Trying to maximize your potential each turn is interesting.  I ended up wasting four moves, including the last one that cost me the game!  I think the strategy here is to fill the high-paying jobs and, if you have a lower scale job, play the market instead and let it wind down a bit.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
What could have been an interesting market/resource management game resulted in a very boring, dull pointless lucky driven badly tested experience. It has some nice ideas and interesting decisions to make (theoretically speaking). 

Major orders give too many points and are totally lucky driven. The difficulty should be getting good stones but marketplace is not used very often. Players usually concentrate themselves in getting one kind of stone that they immediately need to accomplish an order and then, turn order simply decide who's getting that order.

Another thing is that bonus orders have to be there (by luck) for players to get those bonus silver points.

The most interesting decision the game has is the proper use of the market but as I said earlier it's not needed that often because the game permits a wide range of stones each turn.

This only seems to come to the table once or twice a year (we feel it needs exactly four players) but has an enduring appeal.  It's true that luck of the draw for the best contracts influences the scoring, but it's also true that players can target the leader effectively, so the game is better played by people who aren't timid about taking shots.

Some say, if you like Adel Verpflichtet, you'll like this, and I agree -- but I like this more.

An interesting blend of (simultaneous) worker placement, set collection and order fulfillment game.  The nasty aspect don't bother me as much, but I certainly don't think the contracts are well distributed.  You can be screwed if you keep getting the 40's, which in my opinion aren't even with the effort and gems to complete.  I also found it hard to catch up unless everyone make a concerted effort to sabotage the leader, but usually no one would go out of his way to mess with somebody especially if he doesn't benefit from the particular action itself.  The mechanic by which the market value fluctuate is a nice design.  Not a bad game overall, but it is rather repetitive.

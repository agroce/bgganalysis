Have a fair amount of WoW/WoG WWII. Fun as a game, but whoever came up with the aircraft performance models and especially the aircraft firepower allocations was smokin' some wacky tobbacky! Inconsistencies and oddities abound. Also hampered by an eclectic collection of aircraft types. NO 109 F or G types. NO 190 A or F types. NO P-38s. NO Spit V or IX. This is in NO WAY an accurate simulation of air combat. But it IS a way to get non-wargamers to play an air combat game.

There are many great elements to the Dawn of War/WWII Wings of War game. Fire from the Sky adds some interesting early war fighters and attack craft to continue the evolution of the game.

Unfortunately, it also perpetuates some of Dawn of War problems. The "fiddlyness" of the game is high, despite the core idea for the series is that there is as little fussiness as possible: The player mats take up table space and there are dozens of different sorts of chits to litter the mat and cards with. And few are easy to remember. Players often ask me, "What does this mean again?"

I wish I could recommend it more, because the production for the game is fantastic and the miniatures are even better. Could be I need to simply play it more, but my friends have other WWII air combat games they'd rather play—and they've tried this on several occassions.

This looks awesome. Too bad it takes so long to get Wings of War product out the door, both the classic Famous Aces and the Wings of War: Dawn of War have suffered somewhat from feeling incomplete, and taking forever for critical follow-on products to finally become available. It's been almost two years as of this writing.

This game have more differences between planes and rules have more complexity about new mechanics than WW:WWI, this could be good or bad depending on the personal player opinion.

Personally, I like it, but I just play once.

EXPANSION:

I love the bombing rules. It enhances the game immensely. Now I choose....do I load my planes with dop tanks for extra fuel or more bombs? This game is a play system. It gives you the tools to be creative and make scenarios that are exciting and interesting.

For those committed to aerial combat, have at it, and enjoy.
For the more casual gamer curious about the concept, think twice. I found the rules complex and the play rigid enough to not leave much pleasure.

Neat system. Haven't played with all the rules yet, but they look promising. As a pilot I love the theme. I'm also a big fan of the WW2 history. 

The miniatures adds a little something. It's a little annoying when plane paths are overlapping.

More game in it than in the WW1 version of the game (which felt more like nice filler). In overall nice package with lots of planes and interesting scenarios with bombers instead of pure dogfights.

Found it on sale.  I really want the Star Wars game with the same mechanics, but wanted to try this out before spending a ton of money.  I like the mechanic of having 2 actions queued up.  Though often it becomes less tactical and more a memory game when people get distracted, but that just adds to the fun.  I do like the game and will play it from time to time, but I'm not sure I would invest a lot of money in it, though I am a sucker for miniatures.

I really wanted to like this one, I picked it up for cheap at Cancon and was keen to try it out - especially against my current go-to option for WWII dogfighting of Axis & Allies Air Force Miniatures: Angels 20 (A20). Especially relevant as Avalon Hill (Hasbro)/Wizards of the Coast (WotC) have just released the next set, Axis & Allies Air Force Miniatures: Bandits High.

After a couple of tries I am yet to be fully convinced that the Wings of Glory: WW2 Rules and Accessories Pack (WoG) game system (pretty much the same as the Wings of Glory: WW1 Duel Pack above, but with only two pre-planned manoeuvres) is the best way to simply represent WWII dogfighting.

Mrs Fish tried this and while she enjoys the WWI variant (to a point) she found WoG too fiddly with ‘a lot of little counters all over the place’ - and this was playing without the altitude rules and fuel markers.

To a large extent she has a point.

There are some arguments to be made for this game vis a vis A20 which I have articulated elsewhere on BGG, but will reiterate here such as:

1. the WoG WWI system is known and popular, making it easier for potential gamers to try the WW II option.

2. the Axis & Allies Air Force Miniatures: Angels 20 aircraft are not as detailed as the WoG aircraft. They are also much more delicate. My nearly three year old has had a heap of fun with the A20 miniatures, but I would not let him near my WoG stuff after the unfortunate accident that happened to Douglas Bader’s Hurricane after he had it in his hands for all of 60 seconds.

3. the WoG buyer knows what they're getting (i.e. no blind boosters) unlike A20 which has set models in the starter set and then it’s pot luck with booster packs. Also, there is a fair bit of variety of types with each WoG aircraft. Buying blind may be an archaic business model in this day and age and if packaging is what’s turning people away there is something wrong with the business model.

4. the scale of WoG allows bombers to be represented on the tabletop, and there is a pretty good range of them on offer. A20 now has the P-38 and Me 110, but anything larger is represented by a counter (provided by the player). This detracts somewhat from the visual appeal of the game as a fairly standard fighter mission is to protect, or attack, bomber formations. Also the A20 counters are pretty flimsy whereas the WoG ones are sturdy and fit-for-purpose.

5. WotC haven’t really supported this game at all. It’s hardly been promoted and much of the support for this game (some of which is superb) is user generated. By contrast, there is a large and enthusiastic level of both official and fan generated materials for WoG (more for WWI, but that’s the more established system).

6. A20 is hex based and requires specific maps with hexes to play on (included in each basic set) while WoG uses card and rules to measure things and can be played on any sort of surface - note three sets of maps have been released recently for WoG, invalidating this point somewhat.

7. the WoG creator is a popular ‘regular’ on BGG and is very friendly and open to both questions and constructive feedback.

That’s not to say that WoG is necessarily better than A20 (I like both) but rather that there is already a pretty well established major player in the limited market of WWII tactical dogfighting games and this is due to the way the game is being managed, presented and marketed as much as the actual content of the game. I can’t really recommend one over another but they are both different experiences and prompted, sold and marketed very differently as well. I’d be very interested to hear other thoughts on this.

As I am a sucker for a nice aeroplane model I can see myself picking up a few more WoG models here and there and maybe using them with the A20 rules. This is probably more a cry for help from me than anything else.

Bit deeper than basic basic Wings of War, and good playing pays better here. Harder and not equally fun though, so Wings of War with biplanes work better for casual players. This one is for more serious games. Works well with 3 or more people, altough you need to plan the scenario a bit for uneven sides. That's why I'd go for Fire from the Sky before Dawn of WW2. Don't really like to fly more than 1 plane per player, so I'd rather play something else if only 2 players around.

I also have a BUNCH of WW2 planes for this (both WoW and WoG). I picked them all up on Black Friday 2014, and haven't been able to play them yet. But I'm really looking forward to playing it, it's like X-Wing but with a theme I can really get into.

Fantastic game system and mechanism. Remind me of the good old child days when playing on the floor with my toy planes. It is possible to play all from very simple games to very complex war games and it works fine - at least for us - to play without the miniature planes and just use the plane cards. You can easily create your own scenarios and campaigns and add new home-made components if you like (I do!). Only downside is that you quickly want to have all the expansions but I will recommend you to spend your money on them before starting to collect the miniature planes - the game works very well without having them (the miniature planes)

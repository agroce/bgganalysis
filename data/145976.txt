I only got to play it once, but it was with the designer, which was pretty cool when you think about that.

Jim Krohn seems to know every game I wanted back in high school and invented them 25 years later.  I always wanted a better [thing=1035][/thing] and he gave it to me with his epic [thing=41429][/thing].  I wanted a better version of [thing=36][/thing] and he gave it to me with [thing=84419][/thing].  And I always wanted [thing=1589][/thing] that wasn't so bloated that you could actually play fleet battles.  This is that game.

Writing the ship characteristics on the ship itself (wipe board material) is pure genius.  Adjusting them every turn reminds me of the clix system used in [thing=79127][/thing].  Adding initiative as a property is the icing on the cake.

I've been looking for this game for a long time.  Not Talon, but the game that Talon is, a fun, quick starship fleet combat game.  The game system is amazing.  Lots of depth, but simplified to one decision at a time and very low downtime.  Also, I'm amazed at all the content that is included in the box, 12 scenarios, build your own scenario instructions, and more.  I've played the first 6 scenarios.  Really picked up when missiles were added.

One of the criticisms of the game is that it is two dimensional.  Well the designer addressed this in his notes and I have to agree with his rationale.

Many years ago I played SPI's BATTLEFLEET MARS.  It had a three dimensional tactical board.  As an option we tried the battles as a two dimension game and the feel was about the same.

Hm. After playing some actual FtF I am a little worried that this too much of a microwave job, with not enough original design thought. The Terrans and Talons really are not different enough; we needed a bit more differentiation. Long charge times on a lot of weaponry can bloat the playtime if the initial clashes fail to be that decisive. I still think this has potential, but again, I'd look to the asymmetric scenarios.
---
Just a couple comments after some solo play ...

I think this one has some potential! It's pretty quick-paced, weapons are pretty lethal so you're not going to be circling for hours battering away at each other, and the choices around spending AP are pretty cool.

But, you probably want to stick to the asymmetric scenario, something where one side or the other has a real impetus to act. The "ship duels” do not seem as interesting as they did in classic games like SFB where the sides tended to be *relly* asymmetric (plasma torps and cloaking vs. photon torpedoes, big missile loads vs. phasers, those Hydran plasma guns, and whatnot). In SFB you usually had one party that wanted to get really close and one who wanted to engage at a good stand-off range, so two ships fighting had really clear incentives to do stuff. In Talon, the Terrans and their Talon adversaries are actually not that different. Disrupters and Antimatter Torps have about the same effective range, so you can in theory end up with a lot of tap-dancing as ships don't have a clear incentive to close and start trading blows without a positional advantage. I've only played with some of the CAs so maybe if you open up the ship mixes the incentives get clearer (some Talon ships have long-range missiles?).

Still, given how utterly awful Space Empires was, I was in a wait-and-see mode on Talon but after it sold out I decided to dig, the rules seemed interesting, and my SFB fandom kicked in to grab a copy. Glad I did and looking forward to giving it a bit more play time. I don't know if it's the actual real deal, but should be fun for a bit at least.
---
So funny to read the designers' notes for this one, talking about the game as if it were original when it's really just a re-implementation of Star Fleet Battles (I don't have a problem with this; it's a perfectly legitimate approach to game design. It's just hilarious to watch designers spin this kind of work as original). Anyway, I enjoyed the heck out of SFB back in the 80s and early 90s, so why not? Talon is much simpler and more playable. I'm curious if the marker solution really works, and if the game can be played at scale. I'd play it once. Nobody I know will buy it though, so I might check it out if I can get a copy cheap.

Really enjoyed working on this game. One common thread among reviewers that I will echo is that "this game will get played". It's so easy to pick up and have a really enjoyable tactical battle in about an hour. You're focused on the board the whole time and not on cards or the rulebook.  But don't take my word for it (I'm the developer after all):

Once you figure out the rules and the rhythm of the game, it really is quite simple to keep playing it, just a wall of rules before you can get started.  I unfortunately seem to have received a batch of mis-cut ships that will require some editing to use, but other than that I love the overall quality of the components and the ship combat feels good.  Really feels rewarding to make a good maneuver, and I always like asymmetrical games.

Replacing bookkeeping with laminated counters, and limiting play to 6 impulses were simple but great concepts. This game plays quickly and the player decisions affect outcomes more than most other tactical space games. This has a better tactical system than X-Wing Miniatures. The tactics and maneuvering are almost as complex as Star Fleet Battles, but the streamlined play makes fleet combat much more manageable with a lot less looking up rules.

This is one of the top GMT games to come out in the last year.

Provisional rating after 1 play. It's decent. Very clever in many ways, from the rolling impulse track to the initiative system to the dry erase markers. Essentially, this is SFB distilled down to its core and true 1-turn cycles, instead of that 8-impulse-delay nonsense.

The question is whether or not stripping SFB of all its chrome makes it less interesting, a similar feeling I had when I tried [i]Starmada[/i]. So, not something I mind playing, but I'll probably stick to playing someone else's copy.

Old school fleet battles in space done in a modern way. Must have game indeed!

Preliminary rating based on one game.  Initial game (scenario 2) kind of dragged on with neither side's two heavy cruisers able to decisively inflict any lethal blows on each other as they circled twice around the map.  Was getting pretty old at the end.  As an old star fleet command player, I was almost disappointed by the short range of the weaponry, but this makes sense on the big map.

Hoping this was just an anomaly and my next game will go better.  Will adjust the rating accordingly should this prove the case.

RATING: 6.5
(provisional rating)

It flows pretty well and after getting over the squee-factor of actually writing on the counters, it turned out to be an interesting exercise, describing a not-quite-real-time battle between big-ass spaceships. 

I actually found that writing on the counters was much better than any other kind of book-keeping that could have been done. They even included paper sheets for those who absolutely refuse to write on them, but it seemed just too fiddly to use the small pad.

I'm really hoping more comes out of the later scenarios as the first two only have you messing around with heavy cruisers and no terrain. It's unfortunate that they printed the terrain on the flip side of the ships as it can be a little bit limiting for custom scenarios, but that's a minor quibble - proxy terrain is easily created/sourced/scaveneged.

The only nitpick that I have (which may be addressed in later scenarios) is the "last man standing" victory condition. While great in theory, it turns out that these lumbering hulks can literally circle around each other for hours before denting each other. When there was no real indication that either side is losing so, down to our last ships, damaged beyond reason, we just kept turning and turning and turning.

Talon is one of the few games that I've ever bought just on spec. I saw it on release day at my FLGS, read about it, decided that there was room in my collection for one more space battle game, and purchased it. The only other game I have that is similar is X-Wing. Of course, Talon doesn't have miniatures or artwork/story from a franchise that I already love. But it does have plenty of room for strategy and tactics and treats movement, weapons charging, and turn structure quite a bit differently. While writing on the tokens is very novel, it is also a super smart way of keeping track of everything. Even though each full turn is probably no more than a couple of minutes in real-time, there is much to think about and even enjoy in considering every move and decision that would be made on the bridge of these huge ships. I have only played the first scenario, and there is already quite a bit of game there. I'm intrigued to see what is introduced in later scenarios. The balance between the differences of the Terrans and Talons works well. Checking the impulse letters/numbers and comparing them to ships is a bit of eyeball headache, but it clears up after awhile. Overall, a very solid game that with much ingenuity took older games like this one that employed a whole bunch of book-keeping, and simmered it down to the best parts of those games, keeping everything crisp and interesting. Perhaps Talon hasn't replaced X-Wing for me, but it certainly has replaced whatever space battle game I would have bought later on if Talon didn't come out first.

One of my favorite games in my favorite genre. So many great design choices. It has the great strategy choices of power allocation without calculations (except subtract 1 or 2 sometimes). It says it is a game of fleet combat but note that the scenarios it comes with typically have 2-4 ships per side so I tend to think of these as squadrons.

I think this might be another "believe the hype" type moments. Multiple capital ship engagements might have found the perfect balance of complexity here, where the beasts are complicated and need to be managed but you can manage several at once. I am keen to try more, as the first scenario didn't seem to show even a fraction of what the game can offer.
Oh, and I played it with a Starfleet Battles vet, and he liked it too.

(02/20/2016) Comment based on one play.

This is a much streamlined derivative of Federation Commander (FC), allowing tactical ship-to-ship combat in the Space Empires 4x universe. While Star Fleet Battles (SFB) had 32 impulses and FC had 8, Talon has 6. An interesting feature is that the ship display has been condensed onto somewhat large hex counters, where shields and weapon status are marked off with a dry-erase pen, as well as the energy/speed/turn setting.

Each ship class has an inherent energy level, which can be allocated to speed. However, Energy, Speed, and Turn rate are intertwined in Talon, where faster speeds means wider turn rates, and less energy for boosting shields and/or charging weapons. The decision to shift energy/speed/turn is done at the beginning of each 6-phase turn, and each ship can only "throttle" up or down one step, out of five possible levels. Thus, it will take several turns to accelerate to the fastest speed, where the ship will be able to "act" in all 6 phases. However, at faster speeds, the turning arc is successively larger, so maneuverability is poor. Likewise, deceleration takes several turns. At the slower speeds, the ship will be able to act in comparatively fewer phases, but maneuverability is better.

The condensing of the ship status display directly onto the large counters is a stroke of genius. Players can see at a glance the status of all ships in play. There is also a more intimate feel where damage is marked off directly on the counter, than on a ship status on a player's tableau. A lot of the details of FC and SFB have been abstracted and simplified to make the gameplay smoother and faster. Still, because of the 6-phase turns the game feels mechanically clumsy and jerky, when compared to a more recent game design like Star Wars:X-Wing, due to the need to keep track of turn rates, weapon and shield charging, and the like. X-Wing is less restrictive in terms of acceleration/deceleration, while the turning is handled more elegantly with the maneuver gauges. Therefore, the feel of X-Wing is more fluid than Talon, and correspondingly more fun.

I haven't played enough SFB, FC, or Talon, to say which one is better than the other. They are all good designs, but Talon's cleaner, leaner implementation has the edge. This would mean that larger scale fleet battles would be more manageable. Overall, the graphical presentation is very good, including the quality of the components. This is not a bad game, but the flow does not suit my personal tastes. Rating: "7".

As the designer of the game I want to once again publicly thank my development team for helping to make the game more than I could have achieved on my own.  The system I delivered to them is almost identical to what was published, but they worked with me to greatly improve some of the details of the game from backstory, to adding terrain, special weapon effects and abilities, etc.

I had left way too much on the table without even realizing it and now I can't imagine the game without what they added.

Seriously, they became as passionate about the game as I was and then backed up that passion with a TON of hours and hard work.  THANKS!

Simple rules, yet enough depth to make this tactical space game very interesting. I'm not a gamer - I like Science fiction and wanted to play a SF game - and I get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. The ability to integrate it with Space Empires is a bonus - unfortunately I don't think I would be able to set aside enough time to be able to run them side by side. It would make for a very long game.
Works very well as a solitaire game - in fact that's how I play it.

Hadn't looked too hard at this mostly because I don't like the idea of dry erase markers on components. But since I got Space Empires 4x for free, I looked at this and was pleased to learn you can track info on a separate sheet console.
The 2 markers included in the game dried up really quickly during our first play, so that made things go on longer than necessary and really put a damper on the whole experience. Regardless of the poor marker issue, it seems that the pacing of the game is a little on the slow side, which keeps it from being really exciting. We will have to play it more to see if my initial impression is correct. That said, the system itself is quite simple. I appreciate having this in lieu of the old FASA Starship Combat Simulator and Star Fleet Battles. Not sure if I will be able to get my group to play again, but things may go more smoothly now that we know how to play and if I can get some quality dry erase markers.

After 2 plays, kinda neutral on it.  Going to try a larger fight.  I don't like the mixing of firing/shield/movement arcs between hex and square.  Not intuitive for me.
One on one is pretty dull.  The two on two fight took well over an hour, maybe two.  Same problem I had with SFB - 10 seconds of space combat in only 3 hours.
Also hate the constant /pickup/mark/erase/ with the counters and pens, just as fiddly or even more so than paper or cards.

This is a brilliant design on many levels.  Removes all the drudgery of Star Fleet Battles and leaves the excitement and fun.  Using dry erase markers to write relevant information directly on the large ship counters makes the game flow so easily.  The game includes a nice variety of scenarios plus rules for creating your own, as well as a campaign game that looks to be the cherry on top of the sundae.  The tie-in to Space Empires seems a bit forced, and the artwork is a little on the cartoonish side, but these are minor quibbles.  Kudos to Jim Krohn and GMT for a real winner.

A surprisingly light 2-6 player tactical space-combat game.

Keep in mind, by "light", I mean relatively speaking (compared to other games in similar genres). There are still a LOT of rules to remember here and a complex sequence of steps you must work through in order every round!

Also worth noting is the game's snail pace. You will frequently spend several turns slowly maneuvering your ships around your opponent's ships, fiddling with power allocation every so often, before you finally get to line up your guns at optimal range and fire! Then you have to start the whole sequence over again and probably won't get another shot off for quite a few more turns. If this sounds like fun to you, then you will probably love this game! If you need something a little faster-paced or more action-packed, you will probably want to skip on this one.

I've been a playtester for this game.
It is to Starfleet Battles what Band of Brothers has been for ASL : a simple, fast, yet just as deep, tactical and narratively powerful successor. 

A minor quibble : the setting feels too generic. Which could be a plus for some, since a Federation vs Klingons re-theme is easy as pie. 
As for me, I would have loved a more fleshed out and original one. There is a continuing storyline, though, so there is hope for future releases to expand it!

The first time we play there was a "DUH" moment due the impulse chart.... and honestly the first two scenarios receives a very low enthusiasm. Then something "click" during the fourth scenario and we shift from the "not Talon, not again" to "is my fav game of all the times!". 
Is strange how we all change our mind during the same scenario, but happened! Now we continue to stare at Krohn with child eyes waiting for the obligatories new races! :)

This game has pushed others out of my collection.  It is THE tactical space battleship game.  It combines fun and complexity almost perfectly.  I can't recommend this one enough.

Jim Krohn has created another stream-lined winner with TALON.  Like Band of Brothers before it, he has designed  the game to highlight   the excitement and intensity of the conflict without a brutal set of rules or copious  bookkeeping.  Once you get your head around the unique and ingenious  rules set--there's a treasure trove of possibilities in this box.

Fantastic, intense and rewarding. It might even be worth a '9' but I'd better hold fire until I've played it more.

All of your decisions are important in this game. There's no randomness apart from when your weapons shoot. So expect some chess-style tension as you try to stay outside of your opponent's weapon arcs.

The way that all damage/notes/power/shields etc are marked onto the starship tokens themselves (using a drywipe pen) is genius. It helps too that the rules have been streamlined about as far as is possible for an effective space combat simulation. You hardly ever need to look away from the board.

Similar games (Starfleet Battles, X Wing) are arduous and flabby by comparison. Don't expect the flashy 'chrome' that you get in those games, though.

If you divert some of a ship's energy into 'electronic countermeasures' you can subtly, instantly shift the turn order - which can force your opponent out of position before they can fire. I find that element to be total genius and wickedly rewarding.

Provides a similar experience to Star Wars: Armada, but with shorter setup time, fewer pieces, and a narrower variance of combat roll results. Also, at a lower MSRP, the game provides more content and greater variety than the Armada base set.
Star Wars: Armada has the advantages of prettier components and fleet customization.

I tried it on Vassal where I only played solo games so far. So far I've played the tutorial and the first 2 scenarios.

With the introduction of rockets in the second scenario I started to enjoy play.

In the tutorial and the 1st scenario the sides are rather similar and the units are few which made me think the game is rather luck driven than based on my tactical decisions. But the game seems to get more enjoyable with advanced rule elements added in later scenarios.

Deep, immersive play from exceptionally simple rules.  Let's hope they stay that way!

A very easy to learn wargame with solid options during gameplay.  This one is a keeper, well worth your time to sit in on a game.  Fair warning -- you'll likely want to buy afterwards if you do.

So proud of all the work that went into this game both before and after I joined the dev team. I wouldn't have joined if the game hadn't hooked me in and given me just the right ammount of crunch to cut my teeth on, without leaving me aching over rules headaches.

plays like a slower, more-tactical version of SW X-Wing -- which i would normally like. but it doesn't have X-Wing's cool/portable/quick-play factor.

but, for fleet battles, this is okay and its ease-of-use makes it my current go-to ruleset, displacing Full Thrust.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] They call it a streamlined SFB-like game. Looks good.

I've become a Jim Krohn fan after playing Band of Brothers, so I'm more interested in this now.

There is not enough "chrome" in this game to keep me interested (like events, special abilities, ...). It's just too dry and abstract.

The very cheap quality dry-erase markers that came with the game were already dried out when I opened the box. It's quite frustrating when you pay that much for a game and find the markers to be garbage.

Also, the second printing will have ship counters with improved lamination. I have the first printing but I also want the counters with improved lamination, because I have difficulties cleaning them. So I have to buy this game again to get the component quality I deserve as a supporter of this game. It really is a pity that the GMT P500 supporters that make the publication of a game possible in the first place are in fact second-class customers, because the only get flawed first editions and in most cases do not have access to updated components.

Don't buy first editions of GMT games, especially so if you don't live in the US.

Update: GMT offers the new counters with improved lamination separately. These are still too expensive if you don't live in the US due to the shipping cost.

Not as streamlined as I had hoped. While I enjoy everything being right in your field of view, I have trouble with the whole impulse chart thing and finding a flow to my actions. Maybe I'll get better with more plays. Still a ton of fun. In my experience the listed play time is wildly inaccurate...games go on much longer then stated in the description.

This is a lot of fun, crazy tactical. It takes awhile to position your vehicles, but that's half the fun and once they're in the fight it can get brutal! Lots of re-playability and tons of scenarios and a beautiful campaign mode. Also, there are additional rules to pair this with Space Empires 4x, another amazing Jim Krohn design!

Slow and plodding. I wanted to feel like I was zipping through the stars. Instead, I felt like we were maneuvering garbage trucks in small parking lots. Garbage trucks that couldn't go in reverse.

Despite that, I would play again if asked.

Talon is a funny cross between being inventive and being archaic.  I don't think many game designs are able to achieve that.  (I also don't think it's a goal most designers would try to achieve.)

Anyways, it is a cool game in which positioning your ship for attack can be a fairly difficult proposition.  The use of dry-erase markers feels kind of gimmicky, but I can only imagine how many counters it must save, so I should probably appreciate the gimmick.

I haven't tried games like X-Wing or Armada so have no basis for comparison with space miniature games, which this obviously is, minus the miniatures.

I suspect my rating would go up with more experience and after trying other scenarios.

Simple and intuitive rules.  I can see the attraction for an approachable fleet combat board game.  The Power/Speed/Turning numbers work well relative to momentum shifts.  It's definitely  a more old school approach when compared to the toy/minis approach taken by Star Wars: Armada.  With all my fleet combat games I own, I think this one still fits my collection as both accessible, and different enough to own.

The more I play this, the more I appreciate how solid the design is.  So simple to play; quick action, fast turns, tough choices; yet deeply tactical and rewarding.  Looking forward to eventually digging into some of the more complex scenarios... just need to find an opponent!

Spaceship war game on a hex grid. Run scenarios with planets, terrains, bases or run the campaign mode. This is my first experience with a a war game in space. The dice combat and distance tables, and the power actions have the grit of a war game.  The tactical management of power between charging batteries, movement speed, shields and weapons is excellent. The distinct aspect of the game is using an erasable marking pen to record ship statuses on the hex shaped spaceship tiles.

The perfect game for guys who were in their teens and twenties 40 years ago.  Not sure why this would appeal to anyone currently under 55, unless they're one of the many bastard sons of William Shatner.  Though, come to think of it, Bill S. might have a few illegitimates over 55 as well.  That dude could SOW OATS.

Anyway, in our first try, it took one player the entire game just to get within decent shooting range of the enemy ships.  Uh, ok.

I'd rather play [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93538/battleship-galaxies-saturn-offensive-game-set]Battleship: Galaxies[/url].  It's simply more fun.

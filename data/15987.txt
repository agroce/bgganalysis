RATING: 7
A fascinating theme played in cooperative style, with a ton of great bits that help in setting the game into the right mood. 
Trying to prevent the creatures of the Cthulhu Mythos from overwhelming Arkham, the players use their investigators to run across town, look for powerful objects, defeat hideous monsters and close dangerous portals on alien worlds. The idea is great, but the implementation seems to have its fair share of problems.
The rules are not as streamlined as I’d hoped: some mechanics are unnecessarily fiddly and the game just out of the box is partially "solvable" (some locations are much more worth securing than others, giving the players a consistent advantage against the game). The final, direct confrontation against the Ancient One is silly to begin with, but again it's the implementation that transforms an absurd idea into an even more unconvincing set of rules. Making the final showdown a set of brief narrative quests and encounters would have had much more sense. 
AH is also quite sensible to the number of players:  with more than 4 the game becomes easier, the time requirement bothersome and the downtime annoying. This might be the natural consequence of the fact that often an investigator doesn’t actually *do* much during a single turn, other than rolling for ability checks or combat. It can take two or three turns to get to a destination that you really need to reach and getting into something interesting in the meantime is basically a matter of luck. 
I love the idea behind AH, it's the execution that left me hoping for something more.  Still, if you use at least one expansion (so far Dunwich Horror, with its Injury and Madness cards, would be my first choice) and some house rules to make it run smoother and increase the difficulty, Arkham Horror can be a really good game, with a fascinating theme and a great, great atmosphere. 

FFG at the top of its form. The quality of the cards is still average, but other than that everything is really good.

RATING: 8.8
A classic. Themey, gothic, impossible. One of the first games of this style I ever played and it took more than a decade to better it with Eldritch Horror. But being lost in time and space in the portal still can't be beat.

RATING: 7
Only skimmed the rules, which seem a little hard to digest.
Edit: Have now played once, with the Dunwich expansion.  The game seemed a little bewildering to begin with:  Doom, Terror, money, skills, weapons, spells, monsters, other worlds, gates, closing/sealing, lost in time & space, etc, etc.
My '7' rating is an initial rating and I hope to update it after another play. Maybe I will have a solo play with just the base game.
Oh, and we lost, which is how it should be!

Finally played again, 7 years on, much less bewildering, but playing without an expansion probably helped. My character achieved basically nothing all game, but then most of the others didn't either. We lost, which was deserved. It was an experience that I enjoyed, but there wasn't much game.

Whilst this is unarguably fun with enough 'committed' individuals - the rules aren't entirely clear on some matters, which means numerous breaks to determine what action should be taken.  Also, and partly as a result of this problem, the game is overly long and not as fast paced as I like.  Or perhaps its just not my cup of tea - who knows?!

We have friends who LOVE this game, and we have a good time playing it with them. But it is not high on my list. For a co-op game I feel oddly disengaged when it's not my turn since I can't really do anything at all to help, and the downtime can be pretty long. I think the theme is awesome, though, so I'm usually willing to play.

The most mind numbing game I have ever played. You can barely do anything your turn, and you have to wait for five other dudes to go before it comes back around to you again. And none of the things you can do are even interesting. And I'm not into Lovecraft, so not even the theme can save it.

On order as a gift for someone, along with H.P.Lovecraft's leatherbound commemorative book, including all of his best works. Either the game will interest them in the book, or the book will interest them in the game. I'm hoping they'll connect a lot more with the rich theme and recognise the characters from stories. It's a big bad gift though if if they don't like anything Lovecraft!

RATING: 7
I really enjoy the system, the exploration, and building up of your character. The town works very well, though I wish I were compelled to have encounters more frequently, rather than simply going to the same places to take the same actions.

I also thought the Other Worlds are pretty boring. When you hop through a gate, you're stuck for about three turns or so. The fact that the main focus of the game involves going on hold really bugs me. Also, the fact that all the investigators immediately just start running around closing gates waters down their individual characters.

What I'd like to see from the game is the following

1) a GM style player who manages most of the encounters and information. She would have a mini-map of the town and would track monster movement behind a screen - that way, the players don't know what is where, only the initial location of where the monsters appeared. She would turn the card encounters into proper encounters with minor role-playing scenarios, and the GM would provide additional modifiers to skill checks based on the role-playing. Finally, she would manage the GOO, keeping their identity and the doom track secret, but would provide hints as to what the investigators ought to be doing.

2) To counteract the increased difficulty of the secret information, players would be allowed to have two encounters per turn, and their movement might be boosted a point or two. With the hidden monsters, it would still be dangerous to go too crazy moving around the streets. This would let players have encounters at locations they wouldn't normally go to.

3) Rather than all going after gates, each investigator would have a specific goal based on the story on their card back. The GM would create a short string of encounters specific to that character, which trigger when the characters move to certain location (with clues leading to the next location given at each point along the way). Once the goal is completed, the character becomes a "Hero." Heroes would be akin to a horror movie hero - bold and aggressive with little to lose. The exact specifics of this could be tailored to the hero. For example, you might set their Will and Fight to their max no matter where their slider is.

Pretty fun, but need to set aside an afternoon to play. The miniatures are a great add-on that I feel really helps the experience. The largest complaint I have is that each area could use more encounter cards as the game loses something when you pull one that you have read before.

RATING: 10

Have played several more times, with 2-3 players, and it is AWESOME!!!  The only downside is the length, which is closer to 5 or 6 hours than 3, but perhaps that will go down as well once we get better at it.  

 The downside to co-operative games is often that the theme drains out and you're left with making decisions about which cards to discard, which piece to move where, etc., like in LotR or Shadows Over Camelot.  I'm hoping that never happens with this game, but even if it does, I bought the two expansions to introduce when the main game loses its flavor. 

I've played with both expansions I have so far, and I've enjoyed them greatly as well--this game plays out so differently every time, it's amazing.  I'd still like to find a reliable way to cut down on some of the length, just so I can get this game played more often!

Lovecraft is great, and I love adventure games with lots of theme. I also enjoy co-ops, so this game is a great combination of lots of things I like! Plus you can take out Cthulhu with a shotgun, and that's fairly awesome (even if it's not very Lovecraftian). Unfortunately, the game always runs kind of long and feels like it really slows down somewhere a bit before its over. There's also a lot of administrative overhead.

I ve tried to play it several times, and within my group was not well received because the setup of the game is long, and the complexity of the rules (In the beginning). I love Lovecraft, then I gave the game several opportunities, until I understood it fine (Thanks to the People in Mama Criolla....). The cooperative mood and the horror feeling are great. If you a Lovecraft fan, you have to play it to understand, what I am saying. The design, art is (as always with FFG) amazing... I love to play it, and I hope this stays this way in the future... Fully recommended... If you like cooperative games... this one would be your cup of tea...

Curious case. As a game, I think is quite lame. Mechanics are repetitive and lack meaning most of the time. I still wonder why I have so much fun playing it.

The theme is my favorite, and that of course helps. Theme is everywhere, and somehow manages to overcome the ultra basic mechanics to make every game memorable. Expansions add interesting stuff, and there are plenty to chose from. Made it to my Top 10 as I played it quite a lot, and my group feels the same I do.

Nicht ganz eingängig die Symbole und durch den vielen text auf den karten muss man oft mehrfach nachlesen. Ein Spiel wozu man leute braucht die soas gerne machen und sich auch die zeit nehmen. Bestimmt sehr schönes Spiel, aber für mich einen Teil zu kompliziert und zeitaufwendig.

RATING: 8
A great genre! A blend of 'real world' and surreality set within H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos.

The game requires a 'collaborative' play style to win. As human characters set within a [notionally 1920s/30s] [East coast] American city looking for clues and means to 'shore-up' the portals [to other worlds] through which monsters and demons pour; before physical deterioration and/or insanity take you out of play.

There are an enormous number of play-aids, cards, events, items, spells, character enhancements, monsters, overlords, locations etc, that ensure variety and a degree of 'freshness' each game.

The collaborative play style requires players to work together to beat the game, and as such everyone wins or everyone loses - there can be individual winners calculated if you are truly competitive.

One of the best adventure games in existence. Can be quite long with many players, but it's highly scalable. If players are experienced they may play many phases simultaneously.

I spent several hours trying to decipher Arkham Horror and then finally brought it to the table in the hopes it would all make sense when it starts getting played. I was wrong.

My girlfriend and I actually cried on the way home. We didn't even finish.

I truly love cooperative games. My regular gaming group (which is to say, my pen-and-paper RPG group) tries to get together every two months or so and have a board game party where other people (who don't play in our RPG) can game with us. And this game is played almost every time. We absolutely love it. It really does feel very desperate right up until the end when we can finally tell we are winning.

Admittedly, in the base game Sister Mary is kind of weak but our group got the expansions so she is now a stronger character. In one game, someone had Sister Mary with a shotgun, and she rocked (the nun with the gun, as we called her). 

The learning curve might seem steep - but with some help we have taught many non-gamers the joys of battling Lovecraftian horrors.

I hear that some people are bothered by the length of the game, particularly when you get to playing with 6 people.  As we rarely have played with less than 6 people, I have only found the length of the game bothersome ONCE where we had a terrible downward spiral for four hours... and we were able to bounce back from it, but it took five hours to reverse our fortune... after nine hours we were not too happy about how long the game was... but that was one play out of around 8.

Also, as most of us are RPG gamers, we aren't bothered by all the skills to keep track of, the order things happen in game, etc...

We do, however, find the rules tend to meander like a drunken yak, taking us hither and yon through the rules booklet until we finally stumble across what we are looking for.  So be prepared for some hunts to find certain rules.

RATING: 9.4
Very well accomplished GM-free RPG. Packed with details from the stories and RPG, and vast flexibility means you never have the same game twice.
Impressive number of characters and ancient ones in the box means there are already hundreds of possible start situations even before drawing random items. The ancient ones are different enough and their effects on the game change the flavour of the experience a lot.

I wouldn't play with 8 again, four or five is probably the advisable maximum given you will probably have new players. Two players with 2 characters each is fantastic.

You don't need any of the expansions to get started - the base game is crammed full of enough cards and monsters to keep you going for a long time.

This is not a euro game, theme is everything and fate is cruel. Definitely set aside an evening to play and don't bring it out during a regular games night.

There are better, shorter games with the same mythos theme as Arkham Horror. Simply put, the level of randomness is too high for the amount of time required to invest in a play. I don't mind random plays but I do mind when play goes on for a long time. In my world, randomness is negatively correlated to game length in terms of fun outcomes. Just roll a die and see who wins rather than waste the 3-4 hours to find out who wins the regular way.

A really great game with a simplicy of rules but depth of story.  It takes a while to get all the rules under your belt, but I wouldn't let that stop you from diving in and trying it - if you get a rule wrong you can always correct it next time.

RATING: 4
This game had so much potential... 

There is simply too much here. Too many fiddly rules, too many components, etc, etc. On top of that, some unfortunate design decisions make gameplay a little frustrating (the monster chips have critical information on both sides, the mythos cards don't show the information in the order they are meant to be executed, etc). 

The worst part, however, is that it doesn't capture the theme very well for me. The overwhelming amount of game mechanics keep pulling me out of the moment. I don't understand why the game is so focussed on combat (particularly, the endgame combat with the Great Old One seems completely out of the spirit of the game... shouldn't the game just end in failure?)

It doesn't help that a number of the rules are very difficult to interpret (the monster overflow and the damage application against the Great Ol Ones are big offenders here).

Oh well.

RATING: 5
I feel like the difficulty doesn't scale properly with the number of players.  With two, the game feels darn near impossible.  There's just not enough actions to do anything except run around in a panic trying to close portals.  Maybe that's the point, but I'm not so sure.  It's much less hectic, and easier, with more people.  I'm not a huge fan of how long the game takes to play, but it -can- be done quickly if players are diligent.

At three in the morning, you fly through the empty and dark streets on the old motorcycle that Phil bought for you yesterday at that weird shop on High Street. The motor sounds as if the old beast might not make it through the night, but it doesn't really matter. Nobody will, if you don't reach the Library tonight and close that bloody Gate. In fact, you are not sure if YOU will make it through the night in any case. Your stamina is running low, and your mind is ... so ... far .. beyond what ordinary people would call "madness". The things you've seen. The risks you've taken. Nobody should do that. And live.

Oh well, at least Joe can take the shotgun, he might put it to good use. Shoot himself, before The Servants arrive. Before everybody gets Lost In Time And Space.  

Oh, how I love Arkham horror! It is a game that is impressively true to its name. The rule book is insanely complicated. There are aspects of the game I still don't understand. I am truly afraid of risking a direct battle against one of the Old Ones. Full games take a ridiculous amount of time - using that motor cycle at three in the morning might actually be a realistic (i.e. real-time) option. Arkham takes you along a wild exciting journey of surprising madness, and is truly full of wonderful, mind-boggling, highly entertaining HORROR.

This game was notorious for playing itself. When it came down to it, no one had any decisions to make. It was either go for the closest gate or lose and as such it wasn't too enjoyable. The atmosphere, art, and mechanics were great fun, but the urgency behind them peeled most of that entertainment away. Still a fun game I would play, but not very often. Maybe once or twice ever six months or so.

RATING: 6.5
A cooperative and complex game. Objective of the game is to close all the gates and preventing monsters from swarming into the city. If too many gates open, then prepare for the final boss. Kill him, everyone wins. Killed by him, everyone officially wasted 2-3 hours of their life.

The game consists of many components, cards and tokens. Different characters and different final bosses. Fighting a battle require die roll. And throughout the game, there will be spells, weapons, allies, unique items, money and clue tokens to collect to help the player in his journey.

There's just too much of things to look out for and to keep in mind. And there's no sign of how long this game will last. So only play this game if there's a lot of time to spare, say minimum 2 hours.

Really takes a long time to set up and it took even longer for me to wrap my head around the rules... but after putting in the time, I've been able to enjoy an incredibly immersive adventure horror game.  I'm not really an RPG fan but this takes all of the elements that I enjoy from that genre and utilizes a model that is at times deep and complex but manages to stay really quite lean.  I adore the theme and the illustrations are incredible.  Very well done.

Probably my only ever 10. Never made it to less than 4 hrs with 4 people. I always get tired after the 3rd hour or so to the point where I want it over with, but once it's packed I can't wait to put it on the table again. It's something magical I can't explain. It took a serious investment to figure out the rules details, as the game is super-fiddly (and I own a lot of expansions), but once there, it's very rewarding. The most thematic experience I ever had in a boardgame. 

But it's a game from the time where someone would get obsessed with a game for months. These days, every game gets a small window of attention and then collects dust since the next big thing comes in. It would be impossible for anyone to appreciate this game in this day and age....

this game is chalk full of theme. extremely fun to play. does take a nice chunk of your day (2 1/2 hours is my shortest game and 5 hours was my longest, post first time through). can be played as a solo game or up to I think 8 people. everyone works together (u don't have to but if u want to win you sure as heck better) to fight back little monsters in hopes a earth destroying monster doesn't come forth. very fun game but expect it to drain you emotionally (in a good way) as you feel the darkness of evil coming forth to battle you and your compatriots. if you don't mind moderately difficult games that take multiple hours...then get this sucker!

RATING: 4
Pros:
- Lovely art
- Good setting
- Tells a story while you play
- Fairly easy to play and rhythmic once you get over the initial learning curve of all the exceptions and the procedures
- Surprises galore with the many locations and cards to play
- Good for solo play

Cons:
- Initial learning curve, different monster powers need different rules, exceptions to rules
- Once you learn the locations and cards it can sometimes lead to stagnant play; ex: you are always heading to one location to search and have an encounter
- The above can lead to relatively boring play for some characters so multi-player can be problematic
- Very fiddly in the sense of lots of tokens and cards and moving of same

Huge, gorgeous and epic game. Production values and artwork are one of the best I've ever come across. Really complicated, never managed to play it without using the rule book. I usually end up acting like a RP dungeon master when playing this with friends. Some games tend to stall in the middle, which causes fatigue and in worst cases boredom. Suiting up for the ultimate confrontation is fun, though.

RATING: 7
A most enjoyable game that I feel gives more of a feel of hopelessness and tension of a true H.P Lovecraft story. It has its flaws, many small rules that tend to be forgotten in the heat of gameplay, fiddly bits abound and it does take a while to set up and play, esp. with expansions. That said, I do prefer this over Eldritch horror as it again does feel more 'Lovecraftian' but then again I prefer the sense of theme in Arkham horror but the mechanics of Eldritch Horror more.

I play the Call of Cthulhu rpg, so obviously I love the theme. I could see my 8 rating dropping as I become more familiar with it, but for now, the sense of discovery mixed with the thematic "doom is coming" make it a great game. The cooperative aspect works well, at least with my group of thoughtful gamers. It might be a bit complex ("What do you mean 12 different decks of cards") for some, but we like it.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I was not impressed at all with Arkham Horror. The theme is very strong, I'll admit that, but I was shoked by how shallow the gameplay is. You don't feel like you have big choices to make... You just have to move in different locations trying to close portals, while random events happen all around. I didn't see a puzzle to solve and also the action in Arkham Horror doesn't excites me. There's WAY WAY WAY too much dice rolling... You roll for everything in this game! Everything! And it's not even about the randomness at this point, which is still huge although there're ways to help your luck. Even then you're just rolling cubes of plastic for the entire game! And, since that's not random enough, there's also random card drawing.

I understand why this game appeals thematic gamers so much, but as far as mechanics are concerned: Come on guys! It's a dice rolling game that lasts 4 hours... How can this be fun?

I have played a couple of solo games and two multiplayer games. Overall, I enjoyed them and I may come back to it in the future.

This is a great game to play with the lights dimmed, candles burning, with spooky music in the background, on a cold and blustery night.  The artwork is outstanding, components solid, and the theme is tremendous.  That said, why isn't the game a 10?

It is heavy, luck intensive game, that is not for everyone.  A game with 4 players will last 2+ hours and take up a ton of space.  There are hundreds and hundreds of cards, tokens, monster chits, etc., that can easily get mixed up.  And as I said, there is a lot of luck involved.  Sometimes the cards just beat you down, other times monster packs gather in the streets and block you from getting to where you need to go.  Sometimes the items you randomly draw to start the game are completely impotent, other times you have enough firepower and spells to take out a small country.  Some Great Old Ones are next to impossible to beat, others are easy.

All this said, I do recommend the game, just be prepared for it to be heavy at times, and difficult to beat at times.  If those factors will lessen your enjoyment of the game, steer clear ... otherwise, it is worth the investment.

FAVOURITE GAME - It is cooperative game for connoisseurs. It has many rules, it takes a long time to play out, but it is an immersive game, where every minute is full of excitement, as it has a good share of randomness thanks to its many card decks. It is based on the universe by author H. P. Lovecraft, and the goal of the game is to prevent the Ancient One from awakening and devouring you. It is done by criscrossing a town and doing encounters at special locations or going to the so called outer worlds and exploring offworld universes.

I think the base game itself isn't so great, but with the expansions this game simply shines a lot, this rating is based not only with the base game but with an infinity of expansion cards that were added to the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A co-op that wobbles in and out of feeling appropriately Lovecraftian, but does give you a nice sense of looming disaster. I have two mild concerns.  First, we've played this three times and won three times (against Nyarlathotep, Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth; two six player games and one seven player game).  While one was the result of a very lucky Mythos card at just the right time, there's a disturbingly easy ride in to victory from the middle game.  Second, as we become more familiar with the contents of the monster cup, and the encounter cards, the theming feels much thinner. Both concerns suggest replayability may be an issue here, which presumably explains why this is the Black Game of the Woods with a Thousand Expansions.

Update: A few expansion games later, against tougher antagonists, and our record crashes quite quickly, which is good.  I'm not sure all the extra chrome really does it for me, though.

Later update: we haven't played this one in years, because my friend who owns it doesn't care for it.  Entirely independently I've now got Eldritch Horror, which I've come to prefer as simply less ropey.

I enjoyed playing it.  I suspect I mostly like it for the theme, since I love Lovecraft.  The game is mostly randomness and interactive storytelling, rather than an actual game.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of time spent waiting for one's turn, and there are buttloads of rules.  It also takes up too much space.  I'd play it again if someone else wanted me to join them.  I don't own this game and won't be buying it.

I'll play this if people want to but I won't suggest it. A lot of what people call "strategy" in this game is just knowing the probability of stuff happening at certain locations and assigning (often tedious) roles to players with suitable characters. 

I don't like the dice rolling. It's lazily implemented. I do like the meters though.

I've heard the rules are a mess but I was taught the game and never cracked the rule book so I can't comment.

I fully admit that this game is providing an experience that I'm not really looking for but I don't think that it's particularly good at providing that experience even if I wanted it.

Awesome game of fighting evil with your buddies. For ages the ONLY game that Mrs Algo would actively suggest playing (now, Shadows Over Camelot fits that bill too).

a cross between Board Game and RPG. It stands out in my collection as one of the only "cooperative" games in there. I mean that in contrast to "team" games since in Arkham Horror all players are on the same side against the viciously evil Cthulu and his horrible mates. you have to close gates to other dimensions and deal with the monsters coming out of them, and quickly, or the big evil demon that is running the show will make mincemeat of you in a final encounter. Lots of dice rolling is involved, but it remains great fun. Plus, we have a whale of a time creating our own characters and putting them up against the game.

Defeat the forces of darkness by closing all the gates, placing enough magical signs over the town or simply by waking the big demon up and kicking it out of this dimension.

That's all easier said than done, as the game is full of encounters, traps and monsters that keep your sanity and health on a knife edge.

The base game is excellent in its own right and is worth picking up even if you're not in the mood for the expansions.

Played through half a game with my sister. We played two characters each (one selected, one random), which turned out really well because one of my investigators "died" twice and I would have been really frustrated if he was my only character as the hospital trip and health recovery takes several turns. Very rules intensive the first read through and then had to check the rules for everything. I wish there was a storage tray a la Small World to hold all the bits in the "bank". Besides that, easy to see why this game takes so long to play through. And easy to see how cool the mechanics are with the different locations and location specific encounters (events). Definitely want to play this through again to the end.

It's a theme heavy game; in that it works really well - but too much components are too difficult solved. Could be much more elegant.

And it's fully cooperative - even since the theme MYTHOS would allow for great traitor rules. Maybe with Insanity cards, drawn each time the terror track improves. If an investigator is completly insane -> 3 INSANE! cards - he plays secretly for the OLD ONE. ;-)

The game setup takes a lot of time and the table space required is too much. The rule book seems to miss on some parts of the game and the layout of the book requires some page flipping back and forth. There are a lot of things to keep track of and small parts of a turn can be easily missed. I would not recommend this for novice gamers or a group smaller than three. The theme is well-suited and the gameplay mechanics are interesting once you gain an understanding. There seems to be many similar games on the market that have been inspired by this original.

Not a game for everyone:
1- You must like narrative/cooperative games.
2- You need imagination to fit into the story.
3- You must like Lovecraft (or terror, in general).
4- You must like chaos, event cards and tons of rules and exceptions.
5- You must like dice.

If you accept these conditions, then this is an incredible game!!!

Juego no apto para todos los públicos. Cooperativo en plan todos contra el juego, muy difícil de ganar, algo complejo, muy largo, y muy azaroso. Pero tambien resulta absorbente, adictivo y muy divertido. Me recuerda al Furia de Drácula, pero con algo más de "acción". Imprescindible jugarlo sin prisa, con paciencia y con buena predisposición.

RATING: 8.5
Great game, as long as people enjoy it for what it is; an experience and a story. There is of course always a mathematical best way to win the game, but it comes with less fun.

If you love horror or Lovecraft and medium complex games with dice, this is a no brainer.

6/1-11: Does not see enough table time due to long play time. Usually takes (in my experience) between three and four hours, but can sometimes pass the five hour mark.

What can I say about this game that isn't written everywhere? This is an awesome story game. It's long and random and stacked against you, but overall is a great experience. I've had games turn against us and end quickly. I've had games go on for hours. It's a fun experience but one I usually set down the amount of time I'll put into it before we start playing. But if your a fan of Buffy, Cuthulu, RPG's, or horror stories it's a great game.

Do you love feeling like a game is stealing your lunch money, kicking you in the teeth, running you over in its SUV, denying your college application, and spilling its drink down your shirt? You'll love Arkham Horror as this game does everything in its power to amp up the pressure on players every turn. While it has a lot of random elements, most of them tend to lend a feeling of horror rather than frustration. The base game has a lot of replayability until you start winning every game.

Update 2016: The community is great and has so much custom content just for the base game that even someone who is completely bored with it can find themselves being drawn back to it again and again for very little upfront effort. There are whole player-made expansions out there. This won't reflect on the score as it's unrelated to FFG's publishing of the game.

Update 2017: Game has definitely worn down with time and lack of substantial expansions make me aware of just how limited its potential is. It's still great to bring out when new people want to play.

Unfortunately I began logging my games too late. This game must be one of all my games that we've played the most of. Wonderful game where no game is the same. Thousands of cards and events, monsters and characters to buy, which makes the mood just perfect for a game night. Many expansions where every expansion brings something new to the game and you can make your own version of Arkham Horror. The theme is great interpretated in the game. The fact that it's a hard cooperative game makes it even more fun when you finally beat the old one. 

What can I say? Everything with Cthulhu is a bit better.

When I plan to play this game, I usually set aside about a 4 hour period for it.  And even then, it requires that someone stay on top of the pace of the game to keep the turns moving.  It's easy for my groups to get distracted by side conversations and such during this game.  It's especially fun with the Harry Potter and Scooby-Doo player enhancements.

My chief complaint on this one is the board & components. The board has lots of tiny text on it. It would bear much replaying in order to memorize what each of these does. I'm also not a huge fan of the seeming inevitability of the time drag on this one due to gates opening just as you've almost shut your last one down. Love the characters and the health/sanity component. Like the idea-- very time-consuming.

Reminds me of Talisman.

Incredibly random, drags for hours, poorly balanced, and once a character falls behind they can never recover.

After quite a few plays, I have very mixed feelings about this game.  Some games I can get into the theme a little and have some fun running around the town collecting items, but other games it feels very haphazard, like I really have no control over my game, and there is only one thing to do that really makes sense every turn I have.  My Fiancee isn't a big fan of the game, so that definitely detracts from it, but my friends seem to like it a lot.  I guess I fall in between these two opposing views.

Given that it's trying to develop a narrative experience, I think that Arkham Horror does a fine job. But as a strategically engaging game, I think that it's pretty bloated and messy. It's okay, but since I've played Eldritch Horror I've already played a more streamlined, cleaned up version of the same basic game. 

Of course, both Eldritch and Arkham both boil down to little more than dice fests when it comes to strategy. But at that point the question is how interesting the few options the games do give you to affect your outcome are. I think Arkham is okay--best when played with people engaging with the experience. Eldritch is a bit better.

Quality title. Probably the best pseudo-RPG in board game form I've played. Decent amount of depth, but could definitely be better.  

*eDit: Score lowered a half point due to the fiddly aspects of game play. The game is a touch more abstract than it should be, especially regarding monster / gate limits. Those kind of mechanics really kill it for me since they feel so contrived.  Still the best pseudo-RPG on the market in my experience thus far.  

*2012 update: Sold. The fiddliness really began to kill the game for me. The Other World cards were just too simple, and rarely painted a self consistent picture. Score lowered by another point (to six).

Drips with theme. Just one of those games that takes longer to play than it should. I like the fact that it can be soloed, but it's a lot of work to pull everything out and set it all up. Doesn't hit the table much, but I feel the need to play it more.

I enjoy a game of Arkham periodically. It's gotten a lot of popularity, but after playing it many times, the replayability falls off the table for me. Some of the expansion content makes the game more rich, but it's also very easy to not be as involved in the game as you should be in a co-op game because only one or two people may know all the rules well enough.

The body of a luxury car with the engine of a VW Beetle.  A deeply themed game with hundreds of cards and counters, lavishly produced, and good artwork.

First game was exhausting, as a lot to learn. After 2-3 games we started to get the rules down and it became rather enjoyable. Very immersive, almost an RPG feel, and the co-operative manner of playing really does feel like joining together to fight the Big Bad.  After a few plays, the base game does not seem *too* hard to beat. Expansions can be very cruel and extremely difficult to beat.

I love this game. I am the kind of person that likes to put some themed music on in the back ground and get into the spirit of it. Here's the funny part. I have only played once but it was stretched over a couple of days as my wife and I were taking our time learning. Knew I would like it enough to expand so have already purchased 3 big box expansions. Again, looking forward to teaching the game group. 
(Update)Played two games back to back with a buddy. 2nd one was 2-3 hours long. Really makes a difference once you have a good understanding of all the rules. two thumbs up!

This was the big game that got my existing game group (historically RPGs and occasionally Magic: The Gathering) into board gaming.  Super overwhelming at first, but thematically a load of fun.  Even my wife, who doesn't really have strong feelings for the Cthulu mythos or horror theme, really enjoys the game.  Plays great with 5-6 people.  And I'll occasionally break it out for a solo play (with 2-3 investigators).  We've picked up a few of the expansions within my group (I got Dunwich) and played it regularly every weekend for months.  

It hasn't seen the table for a while since I've been exposing my group to new things, but it'll see play again and will stay in my collection for keeps I think.

RATING: 6
It's beautiful for what it is--a monster coop against very tall odds. The serious fiddly-ness is kind of thematic, as it kind of puts you in the shoes of an investigator facing the ineffable. A lot of the atmosphere also comes from the fact that the game tends to run so long, most sessions I've played ended in the so-late-it's-becoming-early hours of the night.

It's thematic but that's about it. The randomness upon randomness just becomes incredibly frustrating. And I'm not talking about the I'm frustrated because this is a hard game to crack kind of frustration but the I'm getting ****loads of junk thrown my way preventing me from doing pretty much anything kind of frustration. I'd much rather play the CoC RPG if I wanted to engorge in the Lovecraftian theme. Playing this when expecting a good boardgame was a waste of time.

Good game, very thematic and immersive. Based a bit too much on luck on rolling dices, but winning depend of team focusing on some goals or necessities. Best to play in 2-4 because in 5+ players you add 2 monsters instead of one when they appears. Any rules that speed the game are welcome... i consider to not loosing clue tokens when knocked down in core game because in Dunwich expansion you don't loose anything getting instead some small injury cards.

As many have noted, the rules are fiddly and you are at times at the mercy of grim Lovecraftian forces–bad luck can overwhelm the investigators. Very fun and evocative though and can be tuned with house rules and supplemented with better rules summaries and wikis found online. Highly recommend if you have the patience and inclination to play enough to get comfortable with the rules. We've also found that a four-hour playing time is optimistic. With most Ancient Ones my experience is the games average around 6 hours but there are a lot of variables that can shorten or lengthen a game.

I've played over one thousand games solo.  The expansions give this game infinite replayability and crank up the difficulty level.

This is one game that is made for house rules, so that it can be tailored to meet the wants, needs and desires of your particular group.

too many rules, too long a game play. This game is not very fun to me and to teach a new player....takes forever. setting up takes a while too.

Fantastic game...because of the theme and the fact that each game feels like a story...that usually has an undesired ending. This is best with a playgroup who can play this with humour and who don't mind playing several hours for one game. The game itself is quite heavy to learn but if there's at least one player in the playgroup who knows how to play already, then it's immediately much more enjoyable experience.

That is hell of a game...
Totally soloable, it's an epic game, that is incredibly fun to play if you can afford the time commitment, while really hard (and thus rewarding). Every turn, something bad happens to you. You draw random monsters, and each one is more horrible and seems more unbeatable than previous ones. You find clues, you have encounters, you try to close gates, and you get hurt, you get driven insane and wounded by everything on the large board. 

Actually, i don't play this game anymore: Eldritch horror has captured all the good things of Arkham and add a lot to it. It really feels like an "enhanced Arkham".

Great classic and accommodates a large range of players. Provides a great cooperative experience even when losing. 

Some of the cons
- long setup time, fiddly, and a LARGE amount of rules (main reasons why it has been seeing the table less often)
- high luck factor in determining how well you perform (esp on the various skill checks as you have no way of knowing which stat is going to be tested, and in this game it's impossible to good in everything)

RATING: 7.5
Excellent game, if you have the time, and the people to play. Based on the Cthulu mythos, and that is almost enough to sell me, and the expansions add to the locations and things going on. Very much a game to plan a day around though.

When you are first confronted with the behemoth that is Arkham Horror it may seem a little daunting. But the game is not difficult to learn – it's just complex. Once you get the basic mechanics it's a breeze to play. Still – you have to like long games with lots (lots!) of cards and markers. Arkham Horror is a great cooperative game which nicely evokes an atmosphere of adventure and impending doom. It's a great game to spend the entire evening with.

It feels great to play a H.P. Lovecraft game. If the play goes fluent, the game feels great and emotional. If you get stack without any options to make it feels a little bit dull. I hope the Eldritch Horror game will make up this dullness.

Started playing this once. Adria learned how to play over a weekend while she was away. It is a lot to take in when you haven't played a game like this before. I had a great time but in order to play this game you have to commit a lot of time/energy and we usually don't have enough of either.

Would actually be rated higher, but takes a little too long for me to play (and even longer to complete as one might have to take a break half way through). But overall a lot of fun, especially as things start to reach the endgame where you see how each of your actions were meaningful and what you should to do to prepare in terms of the different victory conditions.

Components are really nice, easing play and the rules are easy to understand once you get going.

I like it. For some time I was on the fence about this one, and now I'm happy I bought it! There is a surprisingly high degree of strategy (looking for the right equipment, selling trophies,...) and tactics in the game, even if it'll never be Puerto Rico. And something new and cool happens in every game.

On the downside, you are too busy doing gamey stuff to be roleplaying as the game wants.

RATING: 9
Great because of its atmosphere and cooperative or solo play.

Loses points because of the steep learning curve and LOTS of stuff (both rules and tokens) to keep track of. A few vital rules can easily be interpreted two different ways.

Other stuff: LONG game. Takes an especially long time the first few plays.

Overall: Very fun, just don't be afraid to make a few mistakes or forget something the first few games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Fantastic game
Lots of flavor and story potential

This is not a game to be taken out on a whim.  This is a title you want to center your game night around.  This title requires a significant time investment, even with veteran players.  

Having the host set up as much of the game as possible prior to game nights start is a good idea.  This is especially true if expansions are involved as the expansions make this already large game, much larger.

Warning: Play and become comfortable with the base game first before adding expansions to this game.

Tip: There is an app out there that will take the place of all of the decks of cards for this game.  This significantly reduces space needed.  Free on Android, unsure about other platforms.

The Ancient One Stirs as One of his several eyes opens. 
Portals to other realms of Horror and Torment open randomly through-out Arkham City. More eyes open and monsters of the most nightmare-ish description spew through the open portals into the streets. 
Kill the creatures, close the portals, seal the portals all before the Ancient One Awakens from his millenia of sleep and reaks havoc and destruction while Arkham is over-run by TERROR in its most gruesome form: Lovecraftian based Horror. 
What a Great game. Four Player takes a long time to finish, but it is a theme that I realy like. I personally could play it all day and not get bored. Single Player is quite a nice challenge and is much faster by atleast a couple of hours.

Are you ready to pit your sharpest gaming wits to the ultimate test? Are you up for the challenge of playing a game where the win/loss chance is slicing its terrified feet on a knife edge so sharp that your insanity will be pushed to the final brink of destruction? If you answered yes to these questions....your messed up, go back to the mental asylum. lol. No, seriously though, this game will test you and your gaming skills to the absolute limits as you fight to close portals to other dimension and slay or run away from monsters so hideous and unpronounceable that even death may die. This Lovecraftian based game of horror and intrigue takes a bit to get your head around and may take a few games to get used to but once you have all of the phases and rules mastered, it becomes a game of epic proportions.
 P.S. do not play this game at midnight on the winter solstice or the unspeakable elder gods of the other-worlds might never let you live to tell the story. MUUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA! Brilliant game, absolutely brilliant

P.S.S. When someone says "boardgame", if the games: Monopoly, scrabble and pictionary are the first or only games that enter your feeble little mind, then do not even bother opening the box on this one. Your mundane little brain will explode from the insanity.

Massive footprint? Yes
A ton of rules that you have to wrestle to the ground? Indeed.

3 hour plus game play? You got it.
An immersive world in which you can explore the horror and grandeur of the works of HP Lovecraft? That's what this game is all about. 
Arkham Horror should be in the top 5 of the themed rankings if you ask us (which you probably aren't. No worries). We don't think there are too many more games that "put you there" like AH does.

Gioco complesso, ma dopo la prima partita si è padroni delle meccaniche; purtroppo lo ritengo poco bilanciato, una partita può durare anche 10 minuti se gira male... o 4/5 ore.
Se un giocatore pesca male, è condannato a passare la partita marginalmente, purtroppo anche andare a comprare gli oggetti, per esempio negli oggetti comuni sono tantissime varietà, sopratutto quando si va ad aggiungere qualche espansione.
Difficile curarsi (bisogna andare in luogo apposito), ancor più difficile usare magie, perchè consumano sanità mentale (salvo recarsi al manicomio a curarsi). Tutto ciò non rende il gioco difficile, ma frustrante.
Ovviamente quando invece gira medio\bene, è entusiasmante vincere all'ultimo tiro, così come le meccaniche delle 100 cose che si innescano. 
Il tutto mischia un gioco da pensatori con il caso più che totale, ponendo il rischio di far diventare il gioco tedioso per l'intera partita (ore).
Consiglio sicuramente di provarlo, ma compratelo solo dopo averlo provato.

Long, difficult, and incredibly tense, this game seems to perfectly capture the Lovecraftian feel of struggling against the unnamable horrors that could end our world!

I've had 2 hour games, I've had 6 hour games, all have been fun, but some have been pretty stressful. The rules are a little complex so it helps to have a lawyer/game master keeping an eye on things, but the options open to players and the feel of control you have over being prepared for the situations that pop up is very strong. Great, great cooperative game!

Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu Rl'yeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!

RPG-lite. Arkham Horror inspired me to devour a "best of" Lovecraft's literature, so it's neat to come back to the game knowing the story behind the characters and locations. I initially rated this game a 10; in short, it is amazing. However, as I'm learning strategies to "beat" it, I find myself less and less inclined to pull it out with people who've played it before.

House rules we use to toughen things up:

1) Take the Elder Signs out of the unique item deck.
2) Two monsters appear at each new gate.
3) Gates are placed face down.
4) Raise the terror level by 1 every time a monster takes to the skies.
5) If a gate appears on a sealed location, the seal is broken.
6) Investigators CAN NOT trade items and spells at the beginning of or during combat with the Great Old One.
7) Investigators make a Sanity Roll at the beginning of combat with the Great Old One using the GOO's combat modifier and the Sanity Roll modifier. Any investigator failing this check immediately discards half of their items, spells, and allies. 
8) During battle with the Great Old One, investigators' special non-combat abilities may be used only once and only if no attack is taken on that turn.

Ahhh. Satisfaction. The waiting was worth it. 

Rich and engaging theme pushes this as high as it does. For non-Mythos/horror fans, it may seem a bit complex and a bit long. But for those who like Lovecraft, it's well worth it. I'm very happy this has a solid solo element.

There is a large set-up time and upkeep. The game itself is a slow grind. A turn mostly consists of hoping to roll what you need on some dice then you end up waiting a long time to have a chance again. It also often feels like the game plays itself as well as a lack of variation which after three hours is too much.

I have this, and all the expansions.
The game has a demanding setup, and the play time can extend way beyond 4h (like in an 8-players game, where 6 are first time players).
Randomness fucks you up more often than not.
All of that limits my rating to 8/10, otherwise the game is great and very much enjoyable.
Add the expansions and everything goes up to eleven: the complexity increases; setup and playtime get longer; and the game gets even better.

Third attempt at engendering a theme of dread and suspense. I was underwhelmed by Eldritch Horror, as noted below—all the globetrotting seemed random pretty quickly and ended up as so much pushing cardboard. The Arkham Horror map is more focused and intimate, and I’m hoping it will do a better job of creating that sense of creeping dread I’m looking for.

With a little help from the BGG community to make Encounters and Monsters, etc. more thematic and less arbitrary, this seems to be closer to the mark in terms of what I’m hoping for. I like the potential for relationships between characters, trading of items, etc., as well. Here’s hoping...

This is one of my best purchases because it fills a unique niche pretty well.  It's a complex cooperative game that supports a good range of players with lots of chrome -- items, abilities, spells, monsters, locations, events, etc.

There are a few small downsides from all that complexity and chrome.  The first is that one person needs to learn the rules very well to help run things.  The second is that it isn't a flawless engine -- sometimes you might have to tweak things to get them working right.

Overall, I haven't found either to be that big of a problem.

Thought it was a pretty good,deep, involving game.  We did a few things wrong, and they were important enough that we could've had a very different experience had we done them correctly.  Would really like to play again, because I think there's a lot there, and a lot of things to like about the game, but until then, it gets a slightly lower score, since it just seems to draaaag, and there's characters that are just stuck doing nothing for a few turns as they do the things that need to get done that the other characters WON'T do.  Not sure if this was just our game, or if it's a common occurrence.  We'll see.

Dripping with the ichor of Lovercraftian theme (except for the fact that you can actually win) great fun with lots going on, if not a bit easy with more than one player... Seal those gates!

Plays best with 2-4 players and you will get the most out of it if you all try to talk through the situation and work out the best way to deal with it. This game tells a good story (therefore you need the right people) and is fun with people who relax into it.

RATING: 9
After 800+ hours of playing Arkham Horror with all combinations of expansions I'll rate this at 9/10.

It's wonderfully random which makes no two games act out in the same way. It can actually be fun losing a game, which is a good thing since you'll be doing that a LOT.

+

Investigators and their background stories. 

Some of the investigator abilities are a great deal of fun. Rex, Wendy and Hank comes to mind.

Artwork and components are of excellent quality.

Reading encounters are tense and fun as they often result in unexpected and hilarious outcomes.

The atmosphere is dense and fits the setting perfectly. This is an evil game in so many ways!

Fiddly in a good way. I much prefer this over the more streamlined approach in Eldritch Horror. Arkham Horror has you running around town and other dimensions collecting monster- and gate trophies. After a few hours of play your investigator carries the rewards and scars of your accomplishments. You become attached to your character. 

After having played hundreds of scenarios the past four years we still play at least one scenario a week. 

Deputy Dingby as a comic relief. 

-

Sometimes it's a bit too random. You just won't know if you'll succeed at a check no matter how prepared you are. If you're really unlucky with the mythos cards the game will be over fairly quickly (or just keep going for 12 hours...) and there won't be anything you can do to stop it. We've lost at turn 2 against Cthulhu due to some bad gate spawns and monster movement in Innsmouth. We've also won against all odds by being extremely lucky in late game.

Some of the investigator are just bad due to a combination of bland abilities, low willpower and sanity and/or low movement. The personal quests (expansion) redeems some of the characters. 

So. Many. Cards. Me and my wife decided to just buy a huge table and leave Arkham there at all times. That way we can get a game up and running whenever we feel like it. We once tore the game down and it took us half a year before we actually bothered to set it up again. 

Deputy Dingby trying to do good but ending up ruining your game instead (please, just stop trying to clean that revolver...).

It is different from Eldritch which I like and has a lot more to remember and keep up but this is personally something that appeals to me. It is definitely a game to bring out though when you have plenty of time to play!

The game is very involved, very detailed, and very good.  As a co-op, it's great that you can give each other advice.  Much of it comes down to luck, but the way the story rolls, the luck feels like just a part of the story.  I'd probably get this for myself if I thought I'd ever be able to play it.

I don't feel anything when playing the game, not boredom nor tension (perhaps when some dices get nasty), neither thrill or terror. This game is too linear for my taste and without any strategy involved apart from distributing objetcs among the characters just to allow them not to waste a turn. Plus I don't find it challenging in any way.

I love the Lovecraft theme. This game does well to capture a sort of pulp adventure trying to save the wold from the Great Old ones.  It annoys me that people say this game isn't dark enough. I personally wouldn't want a game that makes the winner "the guy that kills himself last."  The amount of bits are daunting, but they all work together rather well. Word to the wise though: Get the universal head cheat sheet. The instructions in the box, while being good at illustrating individual concepts, do very poorly to tie them together into something cohesive.   I love this game, but will only play it with my brother, who only visits one time a year.

My problem is much more with the genre than this particular game. Great theme, great atmosphere, but turns always seem to devolve into a group discussion of what to do followed by a mechanical resolution of turns based on the discussion. That is to say, mechanically this game would play just as well with 1 player controlling everyone, which always bothers me.

That said, if you want to do something relatively light and just enjoy the company of some friends-- particularly if any of them are non-gamers-- you could do a whole lot worse.

Played the original when I was young, but when I started collecting and playing designer board games seriously in 2013 I jumped straight into Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign. Well, would you know it, I quite like this too. The revised core game has a lot of content in it, and apart from the art being a little simpler it's all good quality. I'd also argue that while I like the gameplay more in EH, this one feels more thematic since you're not exactly globetrotting but focusing in more like an actual Lovecraft story. That said, there are enough subtle differences to enjoy both of them. EH will likely see more table time among my friends, but AH will also see some, and certainly solo play.

The more players you add, the easier it gets.  I think that the sweet spot is somewhere around 4-5 players.  This game drips with atmosphere, and after 3 plays I'm finally getting the hang of it.  I love it, now we need to get the wife to try it.

Not very good on 2, takes for ever to win and you're constantly drawing mythos cards and moving monsters etc. The game takes a lot of time to pack up and also requires a lot of space. If the game wasn't so repetitive it would have been more fun, many of the mechanics work well and the theme is great. In this game anything can happen due to a whole lot of cards and other random things, to me that's one of the game's biggest weaknesses.

Hate this game. Much like Talisman, the character progression is so slow and inconsequential with the occasional luck sack into one of the few good weapons that are lying about.

Not sure where I stand on Arkham Horror, I definitely don't find it amazing and the expansions add FAR too much to manage (that you can easily lose track of one of the counters or ask "did we increment that already?" a frustrating question indeed).

Yup, ameritrash. I like the cooperativeness of it, but there's just way too much looking at little numbers, and because of that the game drags far too much. There was a distinct lack of excitement, and luck played too large a factor. 
Willing to play again to see if the experience improves now that everyone knows what to expect, but not exactly hopeful.

RATING: 6.5
Love the idea of an epic struggle against an ancient evil, but, man, being unable to roll a success after spending 6 clue tokens is [i]frustrating[/i].

Rules and terminology could use streamlining and standardization.  Most of my first ~20 plays required consultation of the FAQ and/or searching BGG for clarification; I expect that continued consultation will be necessary regularly but perhaps less frequently.

Originally rated 7 (2012); re-rated 6.5 (2015).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
only have 4 half plays through in, so my rating is an estimate.  The length of the game is tough... I have been playing it solo, no expansions, with 2-3 investigators.  I will say that luck is heavily involved...  seems most FFG games go this way... but the ability to use a clue token to "try again" is a nice mechanic...

One of my favorite games, Arkham provides an indepth adventure experience with spot on flavour and spooky atmospher for players to cooperatively struggle against unspeakable odds.
Pros: Theme/Art is fantastic, flavour text is rich and variable
Co-operative adventure with unique characters and abilities offering loads of replay-ability
Involved gaming experience with truly nail biting moments 
Fantasy Flight has brilliant art on each component 

Cons: Set up time & # of components can be intimidating to new players.
Time games are generally 60+ minutes
You lose a lot (which I like! but could be discouraging for some)
Horror theme maybe not for everyone?

Undoubtedly a huge amount of work has gone into this creation.  Presentation is first class and lots of bits.  First playing of the game did not gel, lots of pieces simply added to learning curve without adding to the experience.  Low rating due to a combination of the game not presenting a challenge to the team which seemed to win too easily and a dislike of co-operative games.

RATING: 6
Slowly moving up in my ratings.  I was disappointed in my initial experience -- The game seemed a little too easy and the ending was anti-climactic.  This isn't very "gamey" and generally misses the tense decision making from classic Euros.

It does have a great theme, and potential for highly dramatic situations.  Key die rolls can elicit cheers or groans from the whole group and after reading through the FAQ and playing with the appropriate rules it is much more difficult.

It's a long game with a "Role-playing feel" to it.  With the right attitude and an invested group of friends it makes for a good time.

[One smaller criticism:  The board (while very nice to look at) can get very busy, making it hard to get an accurate account of everything in play.]

Edit:  this game ended up falling pretty far in my ratings.  With the right (and smaller) group I expect this can be quite enjoyable, but for me there's not enough GAME in there to justify all the crazy rules and fiddly bits.  

I see why people who love it REALLY love it, but it's not really for me.

Great story telling game, loads of laughing as we uncover the wierd scenarios in which you often seem to find yourself while searching for clues and unique items.

A great "rpg-lite" game that's fantastic when everything goes wrong and less so when the players get lucky and handily win.

It's hit the table a lot and surprisingly even liked by some of my non-gamer friends. Even with all the action it's seen, I feel there are a number of encounters I sill haven't experienced.

I know I will eventually add all of the expansions into the mix, so the replay on this one will certainly be high.

Absolutely addicting. The Cthulhu Mythology being cool on its own, this game totally submerges you in this film_noir-like atmosphere and totally keeps you captivated till the great finish. Can't wait to see what it feels like with an expansion.
EDIT: After some plays, I can say that the game (on itself, without expansions) provides no real challenge. Don't know if my group is really lucky or smth, but the case is that we have not lost a single game so far.Expansions emergency to doublecheck!! 
VERDICT:Choosing (rather than randomly picking) one of the tougher ancient ones in conjunction with at least an expansion (Dunwich Horror in my case) seems to do the trick beautifully. Desperate games, struggling for survival, the way it's meant to be. :D Only downside the time necessary and the large # of players that make it interesting for me.

A good game that grows old after a few plays. Takes too long to set up, and can be quite dull to play. The different Elder Gods and characters do little to mix the game up, so the gameplay feels samey quite quickly.

One of the most boring (solo) gaming experiences of my life. Played with solo detective and gave it another try with 2 detectives. In both cases it took 4+ hours, but I knew by the 3rd hour I was doomed anyway. Some mega bosses seem really broken for solo play (no chance to gather clues fast enough with a couple detectives when you need to pay 8 to close a portal!). This should be a grade of 3 but I guess it might work better with 3-5 players. Too bad I bought it only to play it solo...  A waste of money and, above all, time and sleep.

Gotta love this game with all its fiddlyness it still rocks!!

Eldritch Horror is great also but aside from theme its a pretty different game thin Arkham Horror, contrary to what some people say.  Eldritch is much more of a quest oriented game (go here and do this go there and do that travel to this space and kill this)  where as Arkham is a much more combat oriented single focus game - close all gates before the great old one awakens 

Definitely space for both of these games on your shelf !!

First few times I played this game I was very excited with it.  I enjoyed the sessions very much.  I figured I found a rich gaming experience that I can share with my wife as the game is a cooperative game.  However, tonight's session just fell flat.  Maybe I was tired and I was as patient when I was learning the game.  Maybe I was also annoyed that my wife wasn't paying attention because she was also tired.  Maybe this game is just one of those that I cannot play everytime I want to.  I have to be up for it and my ratings will reflect it.  My 10s are games that I can see myself play and enjoy even if I am tired.  I will keep trying the game and see if I have improved experiences.  For now, I can only see myself playing this in special occasions.
Rating: 7 -> 6.

Can take a while to set up and finish a game, but once you get going it's really good. And it can be played solo. I sometimes have a game on the table and  work my way through a four-investigator game over the course of a week. So far I haven't finished before the cat found the table, but it is still great fun.

Wonderfully thematic game that provides an intense cinematic gaming experience. But the big downside for me is that it takes far too long. As a result, despite how good Arkham Horror is, I won't play it again.

RATING: 7
Reduced my rating.  Many things to like about AH: dripping with theme, good co-operative nature of the game.  But I've also experienced several sessions where the game (or individual players) get stuck.  The game isn't advancing toward a conclusion and the players can't get it there.  Lots of frustration and very long play time when that happens.

I find the core mechanics to be simple enough to explain that I can get non-heavy boardgamers into it easily enough, although it takes them awhile to get the strategery.  I love the theme that practically oozes out of every pore of the game, and this is only enhanced by players acting like their characters.  Truly one of my favorites.

EDIT I loved this game.  I docked it 2 points because I am angry at FFG for such a lack luster effort with Mis. U.
I really felt they robbed me of $60.  I have no desire to play Arkham as a result.  I feel like a bitter, betrayed girlfriend.

RATING: 8
Fantastic mood/theme; winning or losing is a secondary consideration to the feeling the game generates. There are no throw-away turns, and you'll find yourself carefully considering your every move. You don't have to love Lovecraft, but it adds a lot to the experience if you at least know what the world is all about.

RATING: 5
Initial Impression: I'm not a big fan of cooperative games. The components are nice and the theme is fairly Lovecraftian but I didn't enjoy the gameplay. The game felt like a multiplayer puzzle and can suffer greatly from the alpha player syndrome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun, very difficult, takes a LONG time to play, and takes a long time to learn.

Would probably recommend Mansions of Madness over Arkham Horror, as the app both expands the gameplay and moves it along a tad more quickly. Still, Arkham Horror didn't disappoint.

I love this game.  It comes with really solid bits and pieces and its a really nice looking game.  I'm a big Lovecraft fan and this game drips with theme, so its right up my alley.  My biggest issue with it is the amount of pieces needed to play!  You are going to need a LARGE table with lots of room for all of the counters and cards.  Setup time is long but not terrible.  If you love Lovecraft, try this game!

Got to play my first Arkham Horror with 8 players and made a few mistakes.  The biggest one was not reading the whole ancient one card. This would have definitely killed us earlier (we won, but not legitimately).  I think some of the players liked it OK, but some didn't which is OK as I think 4-5 players would be more manageable.

I love this game and hope I can get out a few more times.

Move your pawn towards some random portal, fight random combat, and  have a random encounter.  Honestly, it felt like a Milton Bradley children's game.  What's even more horrible is that the board locations and deck items were almost as bland as Clue!        
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very thick atmosphere and one the best cooperative games. Clever mechanics with one of the best artworks out there. I really really love the theme and Arkham Horror captures the Cthulhu Mythos very very well.

This game will never die! Every match is completely different! Love it!

EDIT 2015: This game is a classic. But you will have games where the game drags on forever. On the other side Arkham will create one of the best eperiences you can have in a roleplaying-esque board game in its best moments. Therefor I love Arkham. And will ever do...

EDIT 2017: This game never gets old. Eldritch Horror is a sicker-flop after more and more games but this game stays fresh. Interesting. And - even for newcomers this game is so much clearer (even with being fiddly) how to win or lose.

The theme of this game is just immersive; it is a game, and it is an experience.  There is a lot of depth, a lot of strategy, and endless replayability.  The recent Summer League scenarios have revitalized even the base game, which I felt had gotten too easy.  Bar none, my favorite game.

RATING: 8
One of my all-time favorite games. Straight-up co-op, which is a win in my book. Excellent theme, excellent mechanics, though it does feel a bit dice-chucky sometimes, which is fine for me, but does aggravate folks from time to time. Tension is palpable pretty much every time we play this game--you are never sure who will win, and about 50-60% of the time the players end up losing it.

Three small downsides: 1) there are a massive number of components to this game. It covers the entirety of an 8-person dining table easily with an expansion or two. 2) It can suffer from "President Syndrome" where one person ends up making all the decisions for a group of players who each "control" different characters. The nerdier players need to guard against this, getting input and making sure to allow players to control their own characters. 3) This typically (not always) plays in 3+ hours, so for people that want a quick study, this is not it. The mechanics are simple, but there are still a lot of moving parts. 

I love this game, but I fully acknowledge that not everyone will.

I initially rated it just below an 8 b/c I couldn't claim that "probably I'll suggest it"...but to clarify, I probably wouldn't suggest it for just a regular game night.  I am definitely always willing to play, but the time constraints of a regular game night make it difficult to table since I'd feel like I might leave some people out.  Otherwise, my b/f and I play by ourselves all the time (2 characters each), and we plan separate, special Arkham nights with a small select number of people.

I bought this when I was discovering board games again. I was a huge fan of Talisman in my youth and this scratched that same itch. This was just before I tried various glorious euro games. So while I feel that this game will be loved by fans of the genre and fans of the luck based adventure games, I know longer have a taste for this sort game. Some things are best kept as nostalgic memories (this sort of game) much like old TV series I loved from my youth. Revisits can be disappointing.

This one's okay, I guess.  A little too long and fiddly for my taste.  Better when there's less people.  With 6 or 7, it took FAR too long for your turn to come around, especially when some of your turns consist of nothing more than moving one square through an alternate dimension, and potentially losing your next turn due to a random event.

A beast of a game, extremely immersive.  An extraordinary story always unfolds when it hits the table.
Almost endless replayability based on the high numbers of characters, great old ones, equipment and encounters.
Difficulty level may be high for some players, but it's part of the game's appeal.
Lots of rules to remember, but the game flow becomes fine once you get a hang of it.
Great for solo play, but be warned : the game requires a few hours and a big table!

I still enjoy the game, but giving it 9 was probably more because I didn't know any better :)

Yeah ok I'm probably going to get hassled over giving AH a 9.. but well.. I love it.  It could be largely due to my obsession with anything Lovecraft-related.. you'll note a few Cthulhu-themed games as you go through!

A lot of people criticise this one for a lack of actual playability, and that the board dictates where to go/what to do.. I've got to admit, I've had some plays like that.. but there have been others where we have been free to roam, gear up and experience more of what the game has to offer without chasing the gate count (one game in particular where we sealed a gate early on, and then the next several gates spawned on the sealed spot..

Wow what a fun game.  Probably my new #1.  We play for hours and hours and always lose in the end, but I don't care.  It's not about winning it's about the immersive experience.  Yes, it would be nice to win sometimes but I enjoy it immensely whatever the out come.  Just added Dunwich Horror expansion and have 2 others on order.  I love love love all the components.  Card, Card, Cards, piles of Cards!  Love it!  Setting it up, packing it up, just part of the fun of the game.  
Hubby and I were playing this at Game Summit with a couple other guys we met in the game library and we were doing extremely well and I felt that we were actually going to win for once.  Unfortunately it was getting clost to closing so we had to pack it up before we could finish.  The interesting thing was that we were sitting at a table near the entrance to the hall and everyone who passed by stopped to comment "Yer all gonna die!!"

I love the Cthulhu theme and pretty peices, but what this game really lacks is the 'game".  I find it more like watching a show or something: "Let's see what happens to the characters this game" with very little to do other than move around, draw cards and roll dice.  I don't think there can even be a "Bad" or "Good" Arkham Horror player.  The group aspect leads to mostly always knowing what the best move is (which usually means "go seal a gate" or "collect those clue tokens there" and nothing ever more complicated than that) and then I draw things and roll dice to see what happens.  Meh... I'll play again with the expansions and alternate rules... but I'll never be the one to suggest playing it.

Okay, I like it, and I love the theme, but it just doesn't do it for me.  The theme and gameplay is just more overt than any Lovecraft game should be, so it loses points from me there.  Also, when you get stuck ina  crappy place, and your companions are running around the board kicking ass, the downtime and boredom can be a bit much to take.  I'll play it again, but probably never suggest it.  Yet, I still want the expansions....

Right now Arkham Horror is driving me crazy.  It's a board game that is dripping with theme, there's a lot going on and difficult choices to make, and it's a cooperative---all of which are big wins to me.  Add on top of that the fact that the game is fiendishly difficult to win---kind of like LotR with Sauron on the 12---although I'm sure it gets easier with more than, say, three players (and definitely more than with two.  And one player is not going to win this game, period, unless they take on multiple characters, which is not a bad thing).  I'm a big fan of adventuring-style games, so I love Arkham Horror.

(Several months later, and the game still drives me crazy, in a good way.  And there are expansions coming.  Woohoo! and all that.)

Update 2015: 

Well, now there are a bunch of adventuring co-op style games, and Arkham Horror has fallen by the wayside for being incredibly long and convoluted. A shame.

I've had this in the past. It was fine, but Lovecraft isn't my main geek and if I'm going to play a long co-op it's probably going to be something else. Still, it's a nice game and I could re-acquire under the right circumstances.

Rich in theme, true to its source and loaded with quality bits, this game is an excellent way to spend an evening; only the fiddliness of some of its mechanics keep it from being perfect.  An exciting solo game, but also one of the best cooperatives I've played.

I dig the cthulhu mythos but hate the extremely long playing time (especially with many players) for such a light game. I wanted to chew my own foot off by the end just to get away. It took 6 hours to play. I can't face the idea of giving this one another chance but maybe I will someday (with less players)

RATING: 2
Most obviously, this game has too many bits.  Cards and chits and markers and more cards. Setup is long and tedious.  Once the game gets started, though the pace slows down dramatically, and the hours begin to tick away.

Once you get into it, you'll realize that Arkham Horror has nothing clever about it.  The entire game is painfully straightforward, and there is no artistry to how it plays.  There is no real strategy to be had.

The rules are complex and poorly explained.  Spells and item cards are often not clear.  Monsters are crammed with too much information.  Fighting monsters is overly complex.  

Ultimately, there isn't much redeeming about Arkham Horror.  It is a VERY long game with too many rules and not enough strategy.  They could have made a much better game if they would have not tried to cram everything in the world into the box.  This game also betrays the Lovecraft mythos; turning it into "Let's hunt the Monsters", instead of a more "Oh, God, what is that thing?!?".

RATING: 3
The one game I played felt very tedious with nearly no decisions that interested me.

Then again, this might not be completely fair, as this was one play with 8 players and all expansions with several new players. Also, I don't consider myself a huge theme gamer and do not immerse myself well in the story.

I played this when I was first getting into the hobby. I still enjoy it to this day. However, I want to play eldritch horror because I have heard that it is a refined version of this game. Again, another game that I will not turn down if someone wants to play. I am always down for a game.

RATING: 7
rating after 0.75 plays. ...with 6 players.

Cons: 
Whoooooo....  3.5 hours, and the game wasn't complete?  BULLSH!T.  Not a fan of that, at all.  I blame it on the 6 players (and not 4), and it started to feed-back on itself pretty hard.  We would get lost and sidetracked on the story because we were all collectively getting bored of the game 2.5 hours in.

We almost need a DM for the game, because someone has to know the rules inside and out, backwards and forwards.

For as cooperative as it was in working towards a goal, there wasn't a lot you could do, team-style.  One guy would have to tank the monster explosions and fail eventually.  Then the next guy, then the next, then the next.  Likewise for closing gates.

With the particular game we played, towards what would have been the end, it was fairly clear that we needed to brace for arrival of whatever mythos beast was going to come and get us, about 4 turns (or a half an hour) before the end.  That's my only knock against the narrative.  

With 6 players, there's the added challenge against you, but there may not be the additional firepower against the added challenge.  That is, only 4 of you may be worthy adversaries against the monsters, but yet there are 6 of you raising the difficulty level.

Pros:
Everytime I play D&D from here forward, I'll be thinking of how much better Arkham Horror is.  A very excellent, excellent, excellent story narrative.  I found myself, for what little I was playing, getting into this game like it had a plot.  I mean, really getting into this, and feeling the ebb and flow of the game.  So, I really liked it, but I didn't like the 4-hour play time.  Much more, at the end of our time playing this, it felt like we were just about to lose.

The single player mechanic had no flaws that I could see.  It was like, a perfect D&D.

Sold:  Really liked it, but it just wasn't going to get to the table anytime in the next 6-8 years.

Solid game but takes a LONG time to set-up and only works with 1-3 players in my opinion.  Having more characters means people will have nothing to do on their turns and difficulty doesn't really scale up much.  Also classic Fantasy Flight so LOTS of rules though that being said only one person really needs to be familiar with the rulebook and the rest of the players can learn the basics to play in just a couple minutes.  Very thematic which is great.

Great game, probably the best cooperative game I've ever played (Ghost Stories comes close). Once you get Arkham Horror set up and all the players on the same page about the rules, you can just dive in the Mythos and enjoy the ride. I would add Dunwich or Innsmouth expansion for a bit more variability. And the only bad thing about this game is that if not played often, all the special rules are bit difficult to remember.

A friend owns this and Dunwich, Innsmouth and Black Goat of the Woods expansions.

RATING: 8
Gloriously theme-heavy bit of Ameritrash where you and your fellow players try to save the world from a (literal!) Lovecraftian horror intent on devouring it.

The game can get a little grind-y, and the setup is infamous; this is as perfect an example of Fantasy Flight's "More tchotchkes means MOAR FUN!!!" design aesthetic as you're ever going to find.  Still, when it's going well, it's a tense, exciting game, and bringing down the Big Bad is a rush.

In theory, this game should have a major problem with The Colonel.  (See my comments for Pandemic.)  In practice, I've never actually seen one alpha-dweeb trying to boss the rest of the table around.  Perhaps the role-playing elements are enough of a psychological barrier to keep that at bay.

Great game if people get into the theme of it. Do not buy expansions it just adds more things to pay attention too without adding depth.  It's a shame there isn't an expansion that only adds location cards and characters because that's all it needs to add lots more reply and story. *Great with 2*

Masses of theme which make this game very enjoyable - like a role-playing game in board game form.  A few tweaks are required to get the best out of the game (see StormKnight's variant as a starting point) and definitely needs to be played with the right people.  Grows on me more and more every time I play.

Great game! You feel something creeping up on you the whole time. Also plays well for different numbers of players up to five. Above that it really needs some house rules. Best RPG/BG combination I've seen. After repeated plays it just seems too easy. Some of the expansions modify the difficulty but not enough. Next time will try some variant suggested here on the geek.

(From library) The rulebook is a mess but the game itself is actually a little better than what you can expect after reading the rules. After a couple of hours we mastered the rules and since then, the gameplay became faster but also very mechanic. And maybe it's because English isn't my native tongue, but I didn't find the game immersive at all. The game was far too long. There's no need for me to play this again, but I'm willing to give Eldritch Horror a try.

Really fun, however sometimes gets boring after the first two hours, mainly when there is more than 3 or 4 people. Everything kind of falls on one person to micro-manage all the little things happening to keep everything straight, while everyone else ends up waiting waiting for their turn longer than attention holds to the game.

RATING: 5
Maybe it would be better if we were more familiar with the game, but there can be a LOT of downtime if people are not doing their turns simultaneously.  You can also spend a lot of time doing nothing at all.

Overall, the decisions are not that interesting, so while the game could be quicker if we were doing everything simultaneously, I'm not sure if it'd be more fun.

In 2005 I rated this game a 6 and wrote:
"What is wrong with this game?
1) It is hard to play the odds without studing the decks. So to be a smart player you have to do research outside the game.
2) It can feel repetitive, even like a chore at times.
3) The mechanic of skill adjustment is really strange. The speed/sneak combo makes some good sense, but fight/will and lore/luck do not make as much sense.
4) The Mythos cards are poorly laid out. They should progress top to bottom with what you need to do when you draw the card. Instead the information is spread all over the card, and after hours of play I still find myself referring to a cheat sheet to help me do things in the right order and not leave anything out. This may seem like a minor gripe, but I bump heads with it every turn, every game...
I wanted to love this game. On the positive side, the vanilla game feels like it already has tons of expansions straight out of the box."

In 2008 I stand by all the above criticisms, but my opinion of the game has changed radically, and it is fully due to how I have learned to approach the game. This is a game that I really wanted to love, but I ended up concluding that it is actually a pretty crummy game. In 2008 I found myself wondering why so many people love this game so much, so I did some BGG research that has change me as a game considerably.

While I've always known that theme, atmosphere, and story is very important to me, previously I've never thought to approach a board game with the primary goal of creating story. Rather, I've generally approached board games, and judged boardgames, with the idea that the primary goal of play is to make wise decisions within the mechanics of the game in an effort to achieve victory, and in doing so have fun. In other words, if a game didn't offer a player enough opportunities to make smart choices to achieve victory, I wouldn't consider it a good game. Luck and randomness were not shunned, but I felt as though too much luck and randomness would drown out the worthiness of even the most beatifully themed and bitted game.

Reading the Geek has expanded my concept of what can make a game worthwhile. Players who speak lovingly of Arkham Horror often speak of creating a story. Indeed, the Arkham Horror session reports are sometimes short stories unto themselves. 

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/304415

Exposure to this attitude inspired me to give Arkham Horror another try. I approached it as a game whose primary goal is to make a story, rather than make wise decisions.

I am not one to study the cards, so the encounters, and their outcomes, usually come as some surprise. Since the outcomes are usually a surprise (for example, a character may go to a location that exhibits a clue and a sanity icon and ends up gaining a dollar), I find it very hard to play an informed, tactically wise game, which makes it difficult to adhere to any conceived strategies. This is a huge negative if your intent is to make wise decisions that will lead to victory. But if you are playing to create story, you come to realize that playing Arkham Horror, with the ridiculously vast expanse of all its expansions, is like walking in an alternate reality.

As with life, you just don't know what is going to happen next. You can make reasonable decisions and assumptions, and sometimes they will work out just the way you might expect. But more frequently they won't. 

So you want to learn some spells? It is reasonable to think that the library may be a good place to research spells, and the board helps you out in that regard. But when you show up and the librarian offers you some fantastic reward for the tome that you just read and discarded on the way to the library, well, crap, that is life. How frustrating. And virtually impossible to plan for or anticipate. And wonderful.

And since Arkham is a such a wonderful and dangerous alternate reality, spending time there and having a hand in an unfolding adventure really is a lot of fun. Again, all my initial criticisms stand, but I'm changing my rating to an 8.

4/12: Changing my rating to 7.

12/12: Changing my rating to 6. I tried playing again with Oslo and Rio, as Oslo has been reading Lovecraft and was into giving it a try. It felt like a chore. The layout of the event cards is so horrible, just remembering what order you are supposed to resolve things is difficult. I think I should get rid of these games as they aren't worth the shelfspace. I think if you were playing with people very familiar with the game and really into it, it could be good fun, but as an occasional casual experience, it isn't a good choice for me.

A sprawling mess of a game that somehow manages to be pretty fun despite its many flaws.  The most egregious problems are that tension doesn't necessarily increase as the game progresses, and it's perfectly possible to be clearly winning with an hour and a half of play-time left to go, both of which lead to tedium.  Good for a snowed-in Saturday, but definitely one to break out every few months at the most.

Raised to a 6, as I keep coming back to this chaotic brew of ill-fitting mechanics and enjoying it.

I really really enjoy this game. Only played it solo so far, so I am limiting myself to rating it an 8 just now, but I am pretty certain I will raise this to 9 when I have had a chance to play it with more players. My feeling just now is that the sweet spot for this game is 3 or 4 people, more than that and the game would likely drag, but time will tell if I am right or not. Great, storytelling game. Not for those who want long term strategies, but if you want to play a story, this is the game for you.

Thematically one of the best games around, Arkham Horror requires you to be a Cthulhu fan in order to enjoy it fully: yet, even if you’re not (I surely ain’t), you may have a very good time playing it, since it’s quite challenging and sets up a superb cooperative play, most likely thanks to it being developed around and with a solid theme such as the lovecraftian mythos is.

Even though Arkham Horror is a very enjoyable - however complex and long - game, my favourite in the horror genre is Mansions of Madness, followed by Betrayal at the House on the Hill, the best choice for a lighter, Goosebumps-like experience: as a heavy and thematic cooperative, go with the fantasy-set Defenders of the Realm instead, and even more so since it was designed by the same author of Arkham Horror. (January 2012)

[b]Update[/b] - Several games later, I noticed a severe issue with this game is the excessive length its turns may take, especially when new or competitive players are around: the former because of their obvious lack of experience with the rules, resulting in the experienced players explaining to them all the available options they have that turn; the latter because of their unceasing pursuit of the optimal action, which means they think endlessly about what to do next.
And in the meantime the other players simply wait and wait and wait...

Such issues aren’t negligible, as they turn Arkham Horror into a cooperative game of boredom, not horror: thus, yawn after yawn, in October 2013 I’ve reduced my rating from 8 to 6.

After playing this game six times now I can comfortably rate this game a 10. It's a longish game, but I don't mind. It's a slow-paced game, but I don't mind. You can lose your investigator and all of their items, but I don't mind (much) -- But when I can't play once a week, I just become downright Evil!

The game is a mishmash of  multiple phases, obscure rules, lots of card flipping and reading of flavor text.  Then you roll dice and hope 5 & 6s show up. Wash, Rinse and repeat for 3-4 hours.  A long and engaging game that will give everyone an interesting story when it's all said and done.  You just have to be prepared for a dense game with lots of little rules.  In this day an age of streamlined mechanics and euro hyrbids, AH seems like a relic of a bygone era.

Arkham Horror is a game set in the Lovecraftian universe and does an excellent job of capturing the feel of those stories. The game can be challenging, especially for new players, but that makes victory even more enjoyable. The components all look very good and professional.

The game usually feels intense and desperate at times. The skill sliders allow for some customization of characters in a very simple manner that doesn't bog down the game. The combat system is handled very well. You can sneak past monsters or fight them. However, most monsters can inflict sanity loss so being good at combat isn't always good enough.

What don't I like? For one, some of the rules seem haphazardly scattered throughout the book. Some better editing could have cleaned this up and made it easier to read and reference. Two, the game doesn't scale very well with the number of players. It will pretty much always be easier to have a group of four players rather than two. Three, while the encounters that you have during the game are very entertaining and sometimes feel almost like a RPG, you have very few choices during these encounters and they do not adjust based on what actually makes sense for your character. Finally, between the large board and the dozen separate decks of cards, it takes up a good bit of space to play. I have no idea how some people play with multiple expansions.

None of those shortcomings are crippling. If you are a fan of Lovecraftian horror, you should own this game.

I'm gonna say this is around a 7 for me, but thats after only playing 3 or 4 times. It seems like a great game, but set up time is a bit slow for me, and also the game lasts a little bit long for a co-op. I think this one really depends on your group and how invested they are going to get into a game like this. I think it has a lot of potential, but I feel myself wishing for something a bit shorter. Also the game takes up a crazy ammount of space.
I think this is a game I want to try and enjoy more, not sure if I have time to learn to do that though.

Didn't see the big appeal. It's not a bad game, but it's pretty light. There's not much strategy to it at all--you just kind of follow along with what the cards tell you to do--and something like that shouldn't last for hours and hours. It would be fine if it lasted maybe one hour, but no more than that.

Played once with eight players, so take the rating with a grain of salt.  It is known to be pretty unpleasant at that number, and it was.

Any game can be fun with the right group though!  We still had fun, but more for the conversation than anything else.

I've now played it with three, and it was definitely better... But I still don't enjoy this game.

Love the concept and the theme and the mechanics.
Hate the time it takes to setup and take down and play.

It's just so hard to bring to the table as no one wants to sit through hours of trying to close gates only to die and end up far away or to lose turns and then be out of the game for a bit.

I can't believe I haven't made a comment here - AH has fast become THE staple game in our collection. it's easy to learn, has little downtime, and presents a significant but not insurmountable challenge to the group despite being a straight-laced co-op with no traitor.

This game is just FUN. Occasionally it just kills you and there's nothing you can do about it, and sure after you seal the fourth gate there's not much that can stop you just winning, but for those broad flaws you will enjoy the three hours of the game 90% of the time.

It's also the only game I've ever played where the fact that there are so many bits is part of the fun. Having loads of GOOs and loads of investigators should feel like a lame fix to a boring set of mechanics, but each investigator's power and each GOO's different effect on gameplay means it is almost endlessly replayable. 

This one deserves its reputation as well as its spot as our go-to game for games nights. I think it belongs in every gamer's collection.

Beautiful production values. Even though we usually lose, we always feel compelled to play again next time.
There have been times however that the game drags on (once during a 5 player game, we had everything under control, we were almost fighting amongst each other who was going to attack the monsters that appeared - but nothing a few simple house rules or the expansions couldnt fix)

The first cooperative I've owned, and one which I certainly enjoyed at first. That said, it is very complicated, somewhat random, and quite long. While I don't regret having played it, I think their are more streamlined options out there for people who don't want to burn three to four hours on a cooperative game. Still, the theme just oozes out of the game in a way that doesn't happen in, say, Elder Sign. Worth checking out if you are into Lovecraft.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is not meant to be about tactics or strategy. It is random yet story-driven and atmospheric with a very nice feeling of impending doom. Players are free to go their own ways but cooperation and specialisation within the group makes it easier to win.

My biggest gripe is that the time constraint within the game is a disincentive to explore which is not balanced by anything else, thus half the players visit the same locations turn after turn while the other half try to tick off the biggest priorities of the moment.

It also takes a lot of space and a lot of time to play. Playing time is fine for my group but setting up and packing away probably takes yet another hour.

It should also be pointed out that the game is rather thin without any expansions. And that it is expensive.

I've only soloed this game, and will reserve judgement until I've had a chance to play it multi-player, which is something I've been trying to do for years.

Edit: Finally got to play a four player game. Started out fun and exhilirating. Unfortunately, the fun started waning quickly once the game trudged past the three hour mark. Still, I realize that such a long game (ended up taking four hours) is an anomaly, and would gladly play it again. It's a total dice fest, but the success/failure mechanism is a heckuvalot simpler than in most games. Anyway, this is the kind of game you play for the story it gives you to experience, not for optimal-movement brain burning satisfaction.

Only played once so far. Seemed fun, but maybe we need to play two characters each in the 2 player game. It seemed like the game was a bit on autopilot the whole time when we only played with 2 characters total. We won in an epic final battle, but didn't feel that we accomplished much during the actual main game play.

Update: Traded this away because we were never going to get it back to the table. There was too much rules overhead for too little gameplay in our eyes. I will relearn how to play Mage Knight every 6 months because the gameplay is that great, but this just never seemed worth it.

This is not so much a game as an unfolding story and you, the viewer/player, get to insert some decisions on which way to go and less often about what to do. Possibly the single most important thing you can do on each turn is to tweak your character abilities before moving to an encounter spot. At four hours per play, there is too much chrome and not enough game to be a genuine contest. However, the production is top-notch and just about everything Lovecraft ever mentioned is in the game. For fans of Lovecraft and Talisman, "C'thulisman" has arrived...

The only bad thing is the play time, it can last anywhere from 2-8hrs, but mostly averages 3.5hrs. That is the thing that stinks. I love the game, so does my wife, we would play it in a heart beat, but the play time is what keeps it from getting out and that stinks.

The story-telling of Tales of Arabian Nights without the hassle and trivial mechanics. The cooperative play mechanics are below the level of Pandemic and Shadows over Camelot and well below Space Alert. Easy to have fun even if you lose. Our family loves this game!

There are things I like about the game but I feel there's not enough meat on the bones to justify the length of the meal.  Also, most of the time it's so easy to plan your moves that there's nothing to think about during the downtime.  Of course, you can use it to socialize, but that can slow the game further.  I get bored with this game.

This suffers from the same 'set up paralysis' that most of my other standard-size Fantasy Flight games possess. Basically, I feel like there are too many pieces for what could be a simplified mechanic, and it takes way too long to set up.

I will always play if someone else is willing to set it up, but less often if I have to put in the time. Still better set up-play ratio than Mansions.

RATING: 3
This game is not horrible, but not real good either. It looks like is has lots of potential, but for me comes up short. Lots components and such make it look like this game will be epic and lots of fun, but in reality it all adds up to a whole lot of nothing. The Cthulu mythos is interesting but this game and its expansions do not really bring out those ideas that much for me. The expansions for this, which I thought would make it better just added more of the same lackluster experience. Its either way too easy or impossible to win, there is no middle ground ever.

Arkham Horror is a great game IMO.  The rules and mechanisms do seem complex at first but once you understand them they are actually pretty easy.  But the learning curve can be a little steep.  I highly recommend that you sit down and play a solo 4 investigator game to learn the rules.  Then once you feel comfortable, give the rules a read through again and print out the flowchart on this site and play a multiplayer game.  It will go a lot smoother rather than spending most of your time with your nose in the rules while the other players are waiting.

This game offers a great Lovecraftian mythos feel and the cooperative nature is great because you all either win or are devoured : ).  

Personally I think this game is worth the effort to learn it as it offers great value.

Have played this several times in the past. For me this is possibly the worst of any cooperative game I've played and that's saying something as I love that genre. I find this game waaaay too long and very boring. I specifically remember one game in which my group started listening to a discussion at the table next to ours and we started talking. 15 minutes later someone pulled us back to the game by asking, "Where were we? What were we doing?" and no one knew. I guess it couldn't have been that compelling to us then. My gawd, what an over hyped game. Probably the most over hyped game on the Geek for me.

RATING: 5.5
Definitely enjoyable.  Dripping with theme.  I would agree that there are better co-operative games out there, but the atmosphere of this game just sucks you in.  With more than 4 players, there can be a lot of down-time... also there are lots of little rules so it's best played with someone familiar with the rules.  **UPDATE** There is a VERY skewed distribution of gate openings & clue token appearances.  This makes me feel that the base game is pretty scripted (i.e. seal the most active gates, then slowly win the game).  I'm anxious to try the Dunwich Horror expansion... which sounds like it will fix this super strategy.  If you want a tougher game with the basic set, i would suggest playing the Hastur scenario (which makes it harder to seal gates).  Perhaps random die rolls to determine gate & clue appearances would make the game feel less scripted.

This game is epic! The rules and systems work, but are clunky. I actually think this serves the theme well and increases the feeling of madness.

RATING: 8
The first day I played this, we tried three times. Stopped Game 1 after an hour because we were learning the rules and had made crucial errors. Game 2 was unbelievably frustrating: an environment card that put virtual mummies in EVERY STREET, combined with Shub-Niggurath (all monsters 1 stronger), meant that we could barely move and couldn't get to any gates, let alone seal them. After a 6-7 agonizingly frustrating turns, this environment was STILL there. We threw up our hands, conceded to the game again and ordered pizza. Thus fortified, we tried a third time and finally played a full (3 hour) game, which ended with us sealing six gates and winning. While the third game was ultimately satisfying, my overall first-time experience was not. However, after a number more plays both in-person and PBEM, the game has really begun to grow on me, and my rating has gone up. The game rules are complex and detailed, but I didn't find it strategically taxing (only annoying), so I consider it a light-medium weight.

The co-op aspect makes this game interesting. There are an awful lot of bits to set up, but then the game progresses quite nicely and you never seem to be able to get rid of the feeling of dread in case the great old one wakes up or too many monsters get on to the board.

However, that said, for some reason, there's just other games I would rather play. This passes the time nicely and builds up a story and so on, but other games are more fun!

I love this so much that I've run a stack of PBF versions of it. I love the theme, the mechanics, the group interaction... it can be a little clunky at times, and it needs the accident/injury cards to avoid becoming horrible at times, but I love being able to mix and match in things from the various expansions. I'd happily play this every week, if the opportunity arose.

It does have its flaws - it's easy in the base version to end up unable to move around the streets, because fighting the monsters is pretty much the hardest thing in the game, and if you end up getting knocked out or driven batty, you lose half your stuff... but the monsters are stopping you getting to the shop, so you can't buy more stuff, so you can't beat the monsters. It can also suffer from one particular player telling other people what they should do each turn.

But I love this, I really do. I just wish I got to play more.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is legendary and you feel it when you play it; it feels as if the game has a consciousness of its own. Especially when using the Dunwich expansion, you are on the edge of a knife the whole game. Resources are scarce, you put together plans in collaboration with the other players, and dread the next card draw to see if the game crushes everything you've put together. It is fiddly and there is much to remember at a time, but all of it seems oddly appropriate, as if it were part of the ritual. If you refuse to relate to a Lovecraftian horror theme or despise fiddly, long games, then you will want to steer cleer. Otherwise, you owe it to yourself to give yourself over to Arkam Horror at least once.

Update: As much as it pains me, with so many games out there, I don't see myself reaching for Arkham as often as I'd like because it asks so much - and doesn't always deliver. It hasn't changed; I have. It goes from a 10 to a still classic 9.

Update: Further pained. Eldritch Horror has made such significant improvements that it knocks Arkham down to an 8 for me. EH delivers much (and in some cases more) of what Arkham does while asking so much less in terms of playtime and bookkeeping.

Shelved for a while. I'll pull it back down the next time I feel like playing a DM, but too much time is spent coordinating the game for the other players that I don't feel like I have much time to play it myself. 

Update: I have just finished the extremely detailed 11-part series here on the Geek, and I have a renewed excitement to try this one out again. This time I'll try a few solo sessions before I go with a group again, but hopefully my rating will change after a few plays.

Update: Ultimately traded away. Just wasn't delivering the type of experience I was looking for in the time required to play.

Love the theme, great looking components. Haven't played it enough to know how to beat it every time as I've read people have done elsewhere, so still pretty tense gameplay. Co-op in this house is a major plus. Unfortunate that we've spent nearly every game consulting the rulebook every few minutes however, easily the most out of any game I own. Have only played it 2 player, although I did enjoy solo play too.

RATING: 8
Cooperative horror set in H.P. Lovecraft's amazingly horrific mythos. 

This is my favorite cooperative game. You always have an excellent sense of urgency and the creeping feeling that the darkness and madness of the alternate worlds will consume you.

You never get through a game without at least 10 or 15 moments of panic where you KNOW that your investigators have lost and are going to be messily devoured by the beasts of Ry'leh.

This was one of my favorite games for a long time. I've played it a ton, but have not played it in several months. I actually had it on the table, took the top off (well of one of the boxes, it takes two stuffed boxes to contain my Arkham Horror collection), peered intently into the box, looked around the table, put the top back on and played something else. Here's what dropped its ranking:
* The game is largely the same. Yes, I play this more as an experience game than a mechanical game (many games allow both, but AH is not one of them IMO). We battle the Great Old One (GOO), and try and tell a story. Pity that the story is often the same. Here's the script: "GOO is waking up, courageous invesitgators risk all to force GOO back into slumber! Investigators break into skill-based roles (street sweeper, shopper, gate closer) seal the appropriate number of gates and win." Rinse, repeat. Unfortunately, even the interesting/funny jokes are starting to get old, as there is no new material. We had a running joke for ages about me. My character ALWAYS was reduced to one sanity early in the game, and no matter how I tried I was always reduced quickly back to one, perched precariously on the edge of insanity. Jokes ensued, laughs were had, but there was nothing new to drive an evolution in the experience.
* Adding expansions didn't really change the experience much. Sure, there's the odd new/different mechanic added, some were good, some were lousy, but the core way of playing the game was virtually untouched. Guardians and Heralds seemed fun at first, but didn't really change much. New critters? Sweet! Not so much, just a bit different and maybe taking some different equipment to deal with. Yeah, new cards and areas, but there's only so much you can add from three lines of text for a given event. Most of them boiled down to the same thing. "Win your die roll or lose 2 sanity". Same jokes, same story.
* The mechanics of the game are fiddly and not particularly interesting. Oddly enough, the game is quite easy to win despite all the dice rolling. The few times things went south and we fought the GOO in combat directly (which is not the desired way to win the game) the dice could grant or steal away a victory. It didn't make the game interesting, just random.
* LOTS of components. I like games with lots of components. I like games with few components. I dislike games with components that are not useful in the game. The spell deck for AH with the expansions is several inches thick. The number of spells you're HAPPY to get out the deck is pitifully small, and the number of spells that are almost unusable (except in some obscure situation that will likely not occur in that session) is quite high. Pull Shrivelling, Flesh Ward or Find Gate? Sa-weet! Pull many of the other spells? They're either useless or have such a high cost that you have to either have the Healing Stone, the tome that prevents 1 sanity loss from casting spells or be the psychologist to be able to use them. A good portion of the common and unique item decks are the same way. I'm not saying that everything in the decks needs to be super powerful, far from it. I'm saying that the percentage of even nominally useful vs. total crap is totally out of line.
* Since AH is a co-op, that can be both a positive and a negative. My current group is not big on co-op at the moment, and I'm likely a big part of that. By playing too many co-ops for too long, I think I'm burned out on them for the moment. I like smashing other players in the ground and trying to prevent them from doing the same to me. Having the game roll over with a whimper or just waste us all in moments due to total dumb, random chance is not particularly appealing to me.
* I guess it boils down to this: Once you solve the game, the story component will only last so long before you want something else. AH has been great for a while, but it's made the migration from the games cabinet to the storage closet. It's not a mainstay of boardgaming anymore and may never be again.

Don't get me wrong, I've loved many games of Arkham Horror. I think some of the weaknesses take time to notice, and your gaming group is a bigger factor in your enjoyment of this game than it is in many others. I still recommend it if I think the fit is right, but it's not the brilliant game I once thought it was, it's just a good, solid co-op for people that are willing to roleplay as part of the boardgaming experience.

I decided my time with Arkham Horror was at an end and solid this.  I do like the game but I didn't want to play it anymore. Space considerations sent it on it's way.

Eldritch Horror has replaced this game for me, but there will always be a special place in my heart for Arkham Horror. More than anything, this game facilitates great play sessions! Plan on getting screwed and having epic victories. Dice heavy. It's all about the theme for people who truly appreciate a game atmosphere. Play it in the dark with candles and spooky music.

When this first released, I loved this game, probably an 8 . Also in all fairness, I haven't played with many expansions.  It's just that I didn't find the game following much of a storyline (which I hear the expansion fix) and I got tired of explaining the 900 symbols to new players. 

Nothing horrible about the game. Ultimately I'd rather be playing the RPG instead. Given how long it takes to play I can get in a session of Call of Cthulhu in just about that time.

Great fun, great atmosphere.  Sometimes the game seems to turn ridiculously in your favour and you feel like there is no way to lose, while the opposite can also happen.  I much prefer the times when everything remains tense and close.

Generally, I detest any dice in games.  This one, however, uses the dice to help generate the plausibility of the story.  I think a general new rule is dice are okay if you are playing cooperatively, so you don't have that feeling that the lucky dice allowed your friend to beat you or vice versa.

RATING: 5
I have the ultimate love/hate relationship with Arkham Horror, because it's a neat game with so much conceptual potential, but at least two hours out of the six and a half it takes to set up and play is spent on tedious "book keeping" tasks such as readjusting your character stats, and moving around/keeping track of all this other little pieces around the board. 

Tons of complexity does not always equal tons of fun, sometimes it just makes for a heavily padded play time, which I'm sure Fantasy Flights learned by the time they created Eldritch Horror, which takes everything I loved about Arkham and removed the tedious stuff.
The only thing in Arkham Horror that I kind've miss that isn't in Eldritch is monster movements. It was fun anticipating monster movements and planning your movements accordingly. But that it literally the only thing. Every other change is a vast improvement.

Almost anybody who has played both games will say what I'm about to say. You can skip this and go straight for Eldritch Horror. You'll be glad you did.

Phhhbbbbbttt!!!  Marbles...?  I've lost em.  

This is the quintessential "ameritrash" game that just oozes theme from every pore.  It is set in Lovecraft's world of nondescript terror and mayhem.  There is abundant phychosis dripping from this little gem which is a rich ecperience and a great game to bring out and adventure with.

It feels like roleplaying and yet it has the simplicity to draw in gamers that wouldn't glance twice at a DnD table or text.

Everyone selects characters which are trying to save Arkham against monsters porting in from other dimensions to wreck and ruin.  The flavor is of the 1930s and there is that heavy art neuveau feeling to it which is appropriate.  I think it is lovely as far as components. Another bonus is that there are tons of players  within the geek community and many other characters and variations which help to tweak it for difficulty,time and flavor.  There are all sorts of creative variants which can help you scale you game to intensity so beyond the printed rules there is just another whole world out there.  

I love to play this and once you get the dice rolls down and how things affect each character its just a great time to play it.

RATING: 7
Fun co-op game with lots of possibility.  I've only played it once and since we were all newbies it was a lot to wrap our head around.  Also I'm sure we did a few things wrong, however we had a lot of fun and look foward to trying this again.  With repeated plays and better understanding I imagine my rating will go up.  

*I'm bumping my rating to a 7.0.  After a few more playings I'm really enjoying the game.  However I do feel the optimum number of players is 4.  Anything more than that and the game become too easy.  With all the expansions AH has become a game system that any group can customize to its tastes.  We prefer to use the base game and one expansion at a time.

Don't worry too much about trying to win and the "game" part of the game.  Playing this for the mechanics ruins all the fun.  Get in a more RPG state of mind, go on an adventure in the Lovecraft universe and enjoy.  Although strangely, the more I play this (about 20 times with and without various expansions) the more polished and balanced it feels.  Great sense of tension and when you do win you and your friends will really feel like you really saved the world.  The amount of material available in the expansions makes this an awesome customizable game system that's pretty much infinitely replayable.  Replaced somewhat by Eldritch Horror.

After having researched the differences between this one, Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign I have come to see that I would enjoy Eldritch more.

Pre-play impressions:  
Lovecraft - should be great
BGG rating - very high - should be great
Components look excellent - should be great

Gameplay :
1. Move from place to place on board
2. Wait
3. Read text on card
4. Wait
5. Roll Dice and check what happens
6. Wait

Repeat steps 1 thru 6 (*)
....Again
....& Again
....& Again
....& Again.........

(*) actually sometimes there are variations in the rounds that really spice up the gameplay such as:
1. Wait.
2. Wait
3. Wait
4. Wait
5. Roll dice and see what happens
6. Wait

Postplay impressions:

After 3 hours in our 8 player game we did win, but to be honest I really didn't care in the end one way or the other.  About half the group had played this one before and all spoke very highly of it.  Those of us new to AH (all seasoned serious gamers) all came away with the same impression....we had just saved ourselves $100.

RATING: 4
It's a monster of a game that takes up a lot of table space with all of its cards and chits and whatnot, but it's well worth the the time it takes to set up. It's even better with the expansions. UPDATE: I'm lowering my rating to 7 because the fiddlyness of it all is beginning to get to me. It's also the sort of game that will only work with some groups.

UPDATE (January, 2009): After a particularly grueling session of AH I've lowered AH to a 4 and put it on my trade block. YEs, it's LOvecraft, and yes, it's RPG-ish, both of which I'm a fan of, but the gameplay simply isn't engaging. Just about every sessions I've had with AH includes a lof of downtime and confusion as people forget what is going on and conversations drift. A good game keeps your attention...

Played a two-player game with my wife.
Both had 2 investigators which worked out very well.
Very nice game where you have the feeling of not being able to handle all the different things that happen all the time.
A tight game with a lot of frustrating cards and dice rolls, and agonizing decisions. The feel that something imminent will happen soon make this a very nice co-operative game. 
Much appreciated by both of us. 

---Update---
This is soo much fun. With the Dunwich expansion I think this is our favourite two player game (with two investigators each). Always nice to sink into the feeling that this game gives.

RATING: 8
One of my favourite co-op titles, this game pits a group of adventurers against otherworldly forces inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft and his successors. The downside is that the Mythos information is drawn heavily from the interpretation used in all of the "Call of Cthulhu" games and products, meaning that their interpretation of the entire mythology is fundamentally flawed to the point that it's almost as if no one working on the product line has ever even read any of Lovecraft's work in any level of depth.
That said, the game itself is an incredible amount of fun. The rules are a bit complex, so I wouldn't recommend playing the game unless someone in the group has a high level of experience with the game, or if your group is fine with sorting through a large number of rules to figure out the way the game actually works.
Overall, the "events"/cards in the game are well-written, the box, board and pieces are all really well-made, and it's a really solid co-op game. A great way to spend an evening.

Arkham Horror just looked so COOL, I HAD to get it. I bought it, punched the pieces, set it up, looked through all the cards, picked my characters, played a solo game. We won with no casualties (I think against Yig or whoever the rulebook suggests for an easy game), and we were never in any real danger. I wanted to play another game, with other players, so I brought it to a couple of gatherings. The game length and complexity meant it never hit the table; and as time went on I wanted to play it less and less. I bought the Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion, but it didn't increase my desire to play again. Now I have no interest.

Though the theme does present an issue to some of the people I play games with, a few of my friends and I thoroughly enjoy Arkham Horror. The game really provides some edge-of-your-seat moments, and encourages working together in order to succeed. I had no background in Lovecraft's work prior to playing the game, which affected the immersion slightly in the beginning, but after the first play I was hooked. The play time is fairly long with more than 3 people, but I still love to see this game hit the table!

I expected to like this game more.  Part of the problem was that we had five relatively new players, so there was a LOT of reference to the rule book.  It's very fiddly, often with multiple die rolls to accomplish one goal, and during other players' turns there's pretty much nothing to do but watch and wait.  Felt very much like Runebound, but less enjoyable.

One of my first modern tabletop games and still a favorite. Arkham is a beautiful mess of a game with a glut of mechanisms and rules that somehow produce a brilliantly fun and thematic experience which simultaneously manages to feel both punishing and winnable, tactical and luck driven. The base game suffers from not enough encounters, but my personal copy is mutated with cherry-picked pieces from most of the expansions and it comes out routinely and is always a blast.

Game tries to be two things at once, which ends up
leaving me simply not enjoying it.

1) It's a co-op optimization puzzle. Too heavy 
in terms of the complexity (due to luck) to easily
solve as such for my tastes. Worse, the fact that
it's this completely gets in the way of the other
aspect of the game.

2) The folks who really love this game seem to not
be into the puzzle, but more into the experience.
I enjoy plenty of experience games (like Tales
of the Arabian Nights) but get hung up on trying 
to win this, because that actually appears to be
the goal. In a game like Tales, I gladly just play
to explore the space. Using prior knowledge of 
events seems like cheating - and the game loses 
much of its flavor once you 'know' most of them.
With this one, there's no where near that level of
story going on - so it's far easier to be driven by
the puzzle; and that puzzle is just not much fun.

Better game than Talisman, but more effort to play
(and about as much to set up). If given the choice
of which bad game to play, I'd probably pick Talisman -
if only for the fact that I have internalized the rules
more.

An absolut fantastic game! Intense, with crazy twists, great theme and fantastic art. With the expansions, it has infinite replayability...even after dozens of plays there´ll be surprises. This game is one of the few board games out there that provide you with an experience that you usually only get out of RPGs: You dive into a massive world and can really get lost in it.

i had played this game for two years and a half, almost weekly. really good plays, and really bad plays. no balance at all, but funy anyway. the key of this game is that it allows to introduce a lot of home-made material (strange eons program), so the game is going growing and growing. since no balance in this game, no matters how many things introduce in it.

RATING: 5
After reading the TWENTY FOUR page rulebook, I realized that I was not going to enjoy myself.  I tried anyway, though, thinking that it must be a good game if it's rated so highly on BGG.  Also, I generally will try any game once.  I will not make that mistake again.  If I don't think I'll like it, I probably won't.  Arkham Horror relies heavily on pretty much everything that I tend to dislike about certain games - too long, too much dice rolling, cheesy "other-worldly" role-playing theme, and WAY too many bits/cards/rules/exceptions-to-the-rules.

Juego cooperativo para entre 1 y 8 personas (quizá con 7-8 demasiados tiempos de espera) y unas 3 horas de duración de media.Me ha encantado este juego. No conozco nada del universo Lovecraftiano. Aún así, la ambientación y estética me parecen un punto muy a favor. Pero sobre todo las múltiples opciones que (al menos tras la primera partida) permite el juego. Tiene un punto narrativo muy interesante: los eventos que suceden en las localizaciones, los textos de los "bichos", de los personajes...
Además hay bastantes objetos, hechizos, armas...lo que hace que parezca que debe tardarse tiempo en jugar en "piloto automático".

2016. Arkham has a great deal of variety (especially with the expansions) and is a fun but random adventure.  The games footprint is a beast. I think it is best suited for solo play or with dedicated players due to length, setup time, and downtime with multiple players.
***Own all expansions as well.

One of the first hobby board games I was ever introduced to. Played with a great group of college friends. We got walloped by Shub-Niggurath and I demanded we immediately set up and play again. I've played this until 3 in the morning more times than I can count, and I will always cherish my warm memories of those college days. I know that it's bloated, and if people aren't interested or paying attention it gets completely bogged down. I still love it unconditionally.

RATING: 6
Played an 8 player game on Tabletop Day 2015

I honestly thought I was going to hate this game. I've played Betrayal at House on the Hill...and hated it! Arkham Horror in my mind was going to be an even more bloated version of that.

I was wrong. One of the things I liked was that I had purpose and could go around and do things (fight monsters, close gate, etc.). Yeah I still think encounter decks are kind of cheesy, but for some reason it didn't bother me as much as it usually does in games like this.

Granted, it had some of the things I don't like about Betrayal: lots of downtime while someone works out their encounter or fight, sometimes boring turns (I moved to the second half of the gate!), lots of pieces to keep track of, etc.

My biggest complaint about Arkham Horror though, was the narrative arc. I could tell at about hour 3 that we were going to win. There was no way we couldn't, and yet we still had to slog through 1.5 hours of jumping through hoops and going through the motions. By the time it ended I was just excited to be done with the hoop jumping, not excited that we had won!

I will not buy this game, but I would play it again. I think though I would want to institute something like a "Let's just say we won" vote if it looks like we'll just be hoop jumping for the next hour or two.

RATING: 10
There are few games I've fallen in love with as much as Arkham Horror.  The theme, the setting, the monsters, the psychological horror, the locations, the characters, the replayability.  Who isn't terrified of the Great Old Ones?  For games that play long 3-5 hours, this one is the top of the list.  I know this isn't for everyone, but for some good old storytelling and monster trashing, nothing beats this game. Ia! Ia! Ia!

Be prepared for the entire evening in the lovely city of Arkham. This game is a monster to set up and expect to spend three to four hours playing cooperatively against an evil elder one. Very complex and expect some confusion on your first few playthroughs.

RATING: 8
Very fun to play - a rare coop game that works well for 2 through 4 players. A little too much downtime with more players AND it is easier to beat the game. Not recommended with more than 4. Also a little too fiddly sometimes with the many, many bits and cards. Still fun though, and I am usually willing to give this a go.

It's all about the theme - you have to see the story behind the mechanics to enjoy this game properly.

I experience a more consistent storyline when playing solo, although I guess that with the right people (my group isn't much into Lovecraft and the Mythos) it might get better.  

I'd rate it a bit higher but the set up time, the actual playing time and the space it needs won't allow me to take it out often. Also the rules are not very intuitive in some parts and you 'll need to have a few games under your belt to be comfortable with them.

It's a great game though!

I played it two or three times with a big group and we didn't finish the game any time. It takes too long, and there's a lot of downtime with many players. I think it might be a good game with fewer players, but maybe not even then. You cannot really make a plan or work together. It's too fiddly with too much downtime. Best (worst) example: you have to skip turns doing nothing, whenever you try to close portals. That's just no fun.

This is exaggerated by the fact that it looks gorgeous, and gamers want to play and like it. UNO is an awful game (for adults) but who cares, nobody is going to suggest playing it. Arkham Horror, on the other hand, is pulling you in (and then spitting you out).

My husband and I are huge HP Lovecraft fans, so this sees quite a good number of plays. We can plow through a game in about 45 minutes now. I love the immersiveness of the theme and even the complicated "fiddly" aspect of the game. Some drawbacks: without the expansions, this game is almost too easy to win; and this is definitely not a game I want to play all the time. It's not good for large gaming events, where you can barely hear yourself talk, and it's most enjoyable when everybody already knows what they're doing.

Can't wait to play a game!  Wow this is a heavy box!

Update:

Played with 2.  What a wonderfully thematic game.  Initially the various interactions can seem a little overwhelming and the rules book can be tough to find little rules in (would have benefited from an index), but the play aids here on BGG are very helpful.  Aside from these minor issues this is a wonderful and engaging game with layers of theme that seems to tell a breathing story as you play.  Very fun.  I really have enjoyed this and imagine it will see quite a lot of play with my wife and I.

A great aspect is that it is easy to set up, play a couple of turns and walk away to come back to at a later date.  This is how my wife and I play these longer games and Arkham Horror really suits this style of play.  Great fun!

My friend owns this one. We have fun when we play, but you have to be ready for a long session. You also have to be prepared to lose, but how sweet it is when you win. It's a good cooperative game, but I think it loses something when there are too many players. Even though my friend owns all the expansions, we didn't play the base game enough for me to truly appreciate what they added to the game (with the exception of the Dunwich Horror expansion which I didn't think was good at all and the Kingsport expansion which we haven't tried yet).

I'm pretty sure we played with some rules wrong, because the game didn't quite feel right.  I spent most of it sitting inside portals that I had never actually attempted to enter (I was sucked in?), and so I had an incredibly linear game that allowed for very few decisions.   I like the idea of this game, but the execution seems to be... unwieldy.   I felt like I was watching other people sort-of playing a game rather than playing it myself.

RATING: 9
Probably my second favorite game.  I really, really enjoy this every time it hits the table -- except when I get "the wrong players".  More than most games, this game is a game of experience, and thus is entirely dependent on the group.  Thank heavens my housemates are the "right players."

Update: Twilight Struggle is battling for the "second favorite" position, but this hasn't lost its appeal, even with just the base game.  The expansions I own have given it legs, now that it's getting regular play.

Tried a solo play. It felt klunky and I couldn't get drawn in to the atmosphere at all. I'm actually quite sad about this, as I really looked forward to try this. Furthermore I bought the Innsmouth Horror expansion along with the core game, well, I guess I won't get to play that. I may try the core game again when I don't know how to spend an entire evening.

It has SO much potential, and I hope my next play will be a better experience. I'll let you know.

I now have played a solo game with two investigators. After having seen a playthrough on Youtube I wanted to give it another shot. Boy, this time it worked SO much better than the first! It had a much better flow, not a superb flow, but it made the atmosphere and story much more creepy and engaging. Combat is still klunky. I think the next play would be even better. I'll let you know.

Captures the Lovecraft mood very well - and I simply love how the players cooperate AGAINST the game.

Once the rules stick it runs nicely though!

Sometimes the complexity takes away a bit from the fun of this game, incredibly hard to maintain a conversation during the game but if we focus on the game story then it is exciting.  

Difficult to win but that makes the rare wins feel like more of an achievement.

Only reason we don't play more often is the time commitment required to play.

If you like the theme and don't mind 3+ hour long play sessions, this is a great game for 2-4 people. With more than 4 people the game just drags on wayyyyyy too long. We mix in all of the expansions into one giant excess of gaming goodness. My only beef is that you really need a huge table and some clever card stacking to get everything to fit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[b]Arkham Horror[/b] is a cooperative game in which the players are trying to prevent the Ancient One from awakening, or failing that, battle with the Ancient One to return him to slumber.

AK plays like an RPG whereas you get a character and build him up according to his strengths and weaknesses, and then battle monsters.  It is well balanced, and easy victories are rare. You have to cooperate well and manage all the emerging difficulties.  Concentrating too much on any one problem will allow other problems to overwhelm the players.

I play with many of the expansions too. The expansions add more characters, monsters, rules, and areas to control. The expansions are rewarding, but they really increase the fidliness of the game.

And that's what I actually like least about the game. It is overcomplex.  There is a ton of rules to learn, and most of the rules are not intuitive. There are a lot of situational rules, and many of the rules are similar to each other  making it doublely difficult to remember how to apply them. I've played this game over two dozen times and I haven't yet played a game where we haven't mistakenly broken or forgotten a rule.  Just about every game we have to pause to look up a rule or ruling. And even though the rule book is indexed, it is time consuming to find that one rule that applies to that situation.

Normally I am the rule guy in our play group. I read the rules for any game we play, and then reread the rules after we played to make sure I got them right. And I try to find the latest FAQs and errata. And with AK, I have read all the rules, errata, FAQs, and errata to the FAQs, many times over, and I still have to search bulletin boards for clarifications.  And even still, I get rules mixed up all the time.

I liked the game, but I am starting to tire of the burdensome rules.

I love how at times the game will ebb and flow where for several turns in a row things are going your way and you start to hope that you might actually win and then the next few turns everything goes to hell and you're back to scrambling for your life.  The variable difficulty level is a welcome addition.  A FAQ is needed for a few things, like most games of this complexity, but overall FFG did a great job with this one.

Rating after a single game with seven players using the Dunwich Horror expansion. Not really as interesting a game as it sounds. There is high variety in the way the game plays out due to the different ancient ones that might appear, the different characters, and the many varied cards that might come into play. But the game still seems to generally take two main paths -- race around killing monsters and closing gates like crazy or (unless Azathoth is the threat) prepare to fight the ancient one by beefing up on offensive weaponry and huddling. With more than five players the game can take a very long time to play, approximately double the two to four hours listed on the box.

In my opinion, this is the perfect style of game--just enough randomness to make each game exciting and unique. I don't remember what happened any of the times I played Puerto Rico, but a game of Arkham Horror can stick with me for weeks, or longer.

Impressive RPG-in-a-box with lots of moving parts.  Impressed with the sheer amount of detail put into this design.  (I love those dollar bill chits).  Some color match-ups are hard to discern, and the monster movement shapes are hard to read, but otherwise well produced.  I'd buy an edition rethemed for Deadlands without hesitation.

A very intriguing game: if you are a lover of mysterious scenarios and atmosphere this is the right place. Gameplay is a little bit intricated and it is required at least a player with experience in your group. It gives the best with Kingsport and Innsmouth expansions.

OK, at about game 8 or 9, reality sets in. The ambiance for Arkham Horror is fine. But the underlying game is garbage. You just spend way too much screwing around: lost turns, cursed, time-wasting encounters. If you get hit by an encounter and need to recover health and stamina, visiting the Asylum and Hospital (which are on totally opposite sides of the board) takes absolutely forever, assuming you aren't blocked by monsters and completely screwed. It's really a nightmare of downtime and mucking around, a game stuck in the distant gaming past. The trade-offs between being stealthy and being fast (for example) are nonsensical and serve only to make you feel hosed when you chose to focus on, say, Luck instead of Lore, because we all know that those two abilities are exclusive.

And there are way too many cards in the game. Apparently they had a 110 card deck but only 55-ish ideas, so we are treated to the spectacle of a "unique" item deck with duplicate items; it's insane that you can get so many dupes in the game simply because they bloated the card deck far beyond the number of ideas they actually had.

This is a silly, amateurish, hack of a game design that has barely moved out of the mediocre mainstream of the 70s, salvaged only by the good art and the players' affection for the theme. There is no worthwhile game here.

Thank goodness Z-Man recently game out with Tales of the Arabian Nights, which while it certainly has a few issues of its own, it throws the utter mediocrity of this game design into sharp relief.
---
Arkham Horror is frustrating because it really ought to be quite good, but there are a number of niggling finishing issues that give it a lot of problems. The expansions tend to have directly addressed the issues, but the base game is just not what it should be. The main problem is pacing and length. Games tend to run out of interest before they end, as players helplessly wait for the last doom token or two that will trigger the final battle for 20 minutes knowing they have no hope to win via gate closings. The final battle is then tedious and anti-climatic, as you roll tons and tons of dice, and the Ancient One usually bites it with more of a whimper than a bang. Also, Ancient Ones who require a lot of doom tokens can result in a long, long game as once a few particularly unstable locations are sealed, gates open rarely and the pace of the game slows to a crawl.

My advice to get the most out of Arkham Horror:
- Stick to 4 players or fewer. 5 maybe in a pinch. But 6 or more can create a somewhat tedious game, and one that is pretty easy on the players (and Arkham Horror is already a pretty easy game until you stack on expansions).
- Use an expansion. So far, I think the best one for my money is The King in Yellow, because it accelerates the game and adds more tough decisions. You can now use nastier Ancient Ones and not have things take forever. Dunwich Horror is probably the next best, just because the new gate locations postpone the tipping point where too many high-frequency gates have been sealed and the game stalls. The mini-expansions play a little better in their "touring" mode rather than "permanent" mode, I think.
- If you have Dunwich Horror, I recommend using the Injury/Madness cards even when not using the expansion itself. It's a pretty easy add, and it lessens the amount of time wasted in the hospital/sanitarium. But, many of these cards really are not that debilitating, so it does make things substantially easier for the investigators - a problem if you're using only the base game. Also, the Dunwich Horror investigator cards seem to me to be on average better than their Arkham Horror counterparts, so bear that in mind too when mixing and matching. Because of the range of strengths, getting a good mix of investigators makes the game significantly easier. For that reason alone, it can be worth playing with only the basic game investigators, since Arkham Horror in general does not suffer from excessive difficulty.
- The expansions seem to have diluted the item pools. Try not to just mix in all the items from all the expansions into one huge deck. I'm toying with the idea of always allowing investigators to draw one extra item when shopping if an expansion is in play, just because  of this dilution (but, this would not apply to the "touring" variations in the two small-box ones).
- Be wary of Stormknight's variant. I know a lot of people like it, but these tend to be more experienced players. For inexperienced players and newbies it can easily double the length of the game, which is madness (because you can tread water by closing gates but not sealing them, so players can run a holding pattern for hours - at least under the core rules, the game will *eventually* end).

I really, really want to love this game.  While I do truly enjoy playing it, the set up is cumbersome and it can be rather slow if most of the players are new to it.  The quality of the components are excellent and overall it is a very good game.  It just has a fair amount of things to keep track of and the rules can be a bit cumbersome until you get the flow of things.  This does add to the replay value and there are a variety of games and challenges.

One of my friends called this, 'Buffy in a boardgame' while laughing his way through killing off monsters and closing gates.  This game is great with 4 or 5 people, and has pretty good flow.  The more you play, the easier it gets.  Supposedly some expansions mitigate this, but I have yet to play any of them.  Even with that, I will pull this out to have a spin periodically.

RATING: 8
Great game but takes and afternoon to complete.  Presentation, theme, component quality, its all there. A co-op game that you truly feel a since of accomplishment when you win. Which for me makes it even enjoyable when my group doesn't. Hands down my favorite co-op game but the time it takes to complete marks it down a bit. 11-17-2011.

Update: So gotta admit this game has fallen a bit out of favor with me. I still enjoy it a good amount and everything I said before is still true. Except for the part about it being my favorite co-op game.  Probably now at number four in that group. It's still a great game but it just feels slow at times and for how detailed the rules are you would think you turn would include more than moving 3 street spaces a turn and doing nothing else for 10 mins. 05-14-2013.

finally got to play this game after years of it being on my shelf. really enjoy it, its a bit random at times but makes for a good story.

edit after several plays I really enjoy the game and will play this one anytime someone wants too.

Sure its a bit random but its not like Shut up and Sitdown said were you can die from drawing a card. Sure you might end up in the asylum or hospital and lose a turn or so but there isn't any player elimination. Its one of my favourite Ameritrash games

Not a tremendous amount of strategy, but more of an RPG board game hybrid.

I think it's more fun from the stories that evolve in your struggle against the your arch-elder foe.

RATING: 5.75
Enjoyable game that we grew tired of over time.  To keep it interesting we played with two house-rules: the first being that monster tokens stay art-side up and you are not allowed to look at the stats on the reverse side unless you choose to fight it.  Second, we would have another player read the encounter cards and not tell the current player the outcomes if the card presented a choice.  

I would never choose to play this game again without those house rules.  They made the game much more tense, interesting, and suspenseful.  We didn't play in a short enough time span to remember the monster stats so this always kept us guessing.  

At times fun, but ultimately grew a little bored and it wasn't seeing a whole lot of plays.  Sold it off.

I've probably logged more hours playing Arkham Horror than any other game in my collection. Definitely an important game for me and my gamer gal, and one that we've had a great time with over the years. Unfortunately it can take too long to get through. It's not uncommon for this game to run about 4 hours. For this reason I've taken the rating down to 8.5 (from 9.5). Especially once you throw an expansion in with the base game playtime can be huge, though quite epic. This just did not get the table too often anymore. After getting Eldritch Horror, which plays tighter and scratches the same itch, Arkham's days were numbered and it was sold off.

Few games can compare to the awesome presence that is Arkham Horror.  The characters, the items, all of it is dripping with theme!  Each session feels like I'm molding a story of good versus a terrible evil, and the good side doesn't always win!  This one is by far, one of my favorites!

RATING: 4
This is not really a BAD game, but the downtime (which makes the game impossible to play with more than four people), setup/teardown time, and game length are just impossible for me to bear. The 4 is sort of a mix between my willingness to play this (at this point, probably never again) and how good the game is (more like a 6.) The game starts out somewhat fun but I rapidly lose interest after the first half hour. 

One of the biggest problems for me is the game seems to be biting off a more than it can chew. There's so much stuff to do in Arkham that a lot of just gets lost in the shuffle because everyone is too busy trying to keep the monsters and gates to a manageable level. I really don't think the game gives you enough incentive (or time!) to explore a lot of the board so you just end up with some unnecessary edges that feel like they could be smoothed down. 

The only thing the game DOESN'T have enough of is location cards. After only a handful of plays you're going to start getting tired of seeing the same events pop up over and over again.

The theme, however, is excellent. The board is fairly ugly but the cards/monsters/investigators and all the flavor text is top notch.

Really what it comes down to is games like Pandemic and Ghost Stories have the same level of urgency, play in 1/4th the time, and - in the case of Pandemic - stronger mechanics, so I see no need to bother with this one.

I played with two people who knew the rules quite well.  This is more of an experience than a game and the dice keep it light.

You can get bogged down in the rules if you haven't played before because of the many cross-references and special cases. Fortunately, most of the special cases appear on the cards and if you have an experienced guide, then even an 8-year old can enjoy the experience and add to the group dynamic.

RATING: 10
At my opinion it's an outstanding game. It's cooperative and you personally can't loose it. You'll never feel dumb or muddle-headed with the game. It encourages teamwork and brings a lot of positive emotions. 

Cards are closely connected to topic and seem meaningful. Sometimes game even questions your moral principles: "You see that well-dressed man tries to walk away with child. You feel something bad about the situation. If you mind your business later the child found dead. If you intercede the child you're banned from this district for insult to citizens".   

Cons are rules are rather complicated and game is long (4-5 hours).

In common with other FFG titles, the rules are poorly organised which makes learning it without an experienced player on hand, a real chore. The gameplay fails to live up to the promise of the fantastic and novel theme. There are no meaningful decisions to speak of and the downtime with 4 or more players really drags. I really want to like this game and to experience a horror-filled adventure but I find little excitement in the long drawn out and often frustrating process of closing gates.

If you've got some time to kill, this is okay, but thinking and planning hurts the head sometimes and the futility of knowing that a lot of the time you're going to lose can be a downer--unless you're one of those people who always win and have to up the difficulty in which case, way to go.

RATING: 6.5
Arkham Horror is a cooperatve board game with the odds stacked heavily against the players (or at least it feels that way!).  Players take on rolls of investigators in HP Lovecraft's town of Arkham, fighting off denizens of the Cthulhu Mythos.

The goal of the game is to close all of the portals leading to other worlds opening around the city before the Great Old One awakes.  If he should awake then players must fight it in a cataclysmic final battle.

In RPG-light fashion each character has their own pool of HP (and Sanity), skills, special abilities, and equipment.  Skill tests are based on a dice-pool mechanic, with the goal of rolling 1 or more dice with a value of 5+.  Equipment, ability scores, and special circumstances affect how many dice are in the pool.

The game is fairly easy to learn (the mechanics are not difficult), but gameplay can take a long time.

Great game, great implementation. I suppose the main gripe is about expansions and rules dropping in and out, although in my opinion it never quite gets tense enough when you're going to lose in the same way that, say, Pandemic does - probably because you can tell much further in advance it's not going your way. 

There are never any complaints when it hits the table though, and that can only be a good sign.

Giving it a 3 after first play. Very fiddly with check after check after check. The checks did not feel balanced either with some being extremely easy to pass while others were impossible.

Unfortunately the mechanics are very dated.

Awesome game, chock full of Lovecraftian flavor, gorgeous art.  A godsend for those without a quality Call of Cthulhu RPG group handy.

Come to think of it, I'd rather play this than a Call of Cthulhu RPG session.  Arkham Horror delivers more bang for the gaming time, with more monsters, spells and combats than you will get in a CoC session, with no chance of getting stuck due to failing to find a clue.

Oh, the tedium, hopelessness ... what is the point of this garbage, anyway?

One of the few games where I don't want to rate it after one play. The sheer density of rules tells me that I would need to play this a couple of times before really getting a sense of how I enjoy this game.

One thing for sure--it is way better than Talisman. However, I also realize now I'm a Eurosnoot more so than an Ameritrasher.

Update: I think I've gamed enough now to rate this a 5. The length is a bit prohibitive. I don't feel like there's as much tough choices in this game as I'd like. A 2nd go at this game might change my mind, but this is where the rating sits for now.

Although this was quite a subject of debate at the SD Strategy Gamers group--after a first-time play that lasted until 2am on a weeknight--I don't think this one is too bad with a little group planning and cooperation, but it's a little too "piecey" and complicated for the amount of entertainment it provides.  As with other cooperative games, who you play with is a big factor (and that was a problem with that game that lasted until 2am).  If I weren't a Lovecraft fan, I might have rated this one lower.  I have to admit it's pretty, in that Cthulhu sort of pretty way.

Still unplayed.. and i really wanna try it out!
Struggling with the rule book now..

UPDATE: Finally got a game played, rate based on 1 solo experience. Great fun! But long downtime due checking rulebook a lot, next game will probably be better. 

UPDATE 2: I'm so sold on this game now!! I dreaming about it, cant wait for it to be played again. This IS a master piece! updated rate from 9 to 9.8 (still waiting for my first 10.. the superb ultimate board game.. this is very close..)

With my old gaming group this game used to take between 5-8 hours to play. We all understand there was a lack of focus on the game at times combined with analysis paralysis other times. Until recently, when I played the game with a different group, I rated this game at a four.  It was too long and impossible to beat. However, after playing with less people and a different set of gamers the game is not only fun, but VERY challenging.  Everyone has to understand the game will not work if they don't all co-operate together. I'm looking forward to trying the game with two players with two characters each.

I really enjoy this as a difficult kind of story making game.  Every turn there is a phase I call "Bad Stuff."  Takes a while, and do not invite people who are easily distracted.  The game starts slow but you can feel the clock ticking quickly and if you match its pace can be very exhilarating.

This title has stood the test of time.  It's withstood competition.  It's always enjoyed when it hits the table, but one does have to be in the mood and has to have time, or the ability to leave it set up.

It's not as chaotic as the nay-sayers say.  Good players see the choices, see the strategy.

It's not perfect, but it's a nine if not a ten.

Discover all the fan generated content to really enjoy the game.

We have Dunwich, Innsmouth, and Curse of the Pharaoh (1st).  We find it best when playing with an expansion, to play with only that one, and to keep the cards from others out of the game (save the wealth of items/spells/ etc from Dunwich).

This game is tons of fun if you don't take it too seriously.  I love messing around with a few friends battling the GOOs.  The Cthulhu mythos makes for great theme, which the expansions enhance, at the cost of a little playability.  Requires a very large table.

Bought at Games Galore on 3/2/2017. Played that night with Danny and Izzy and we really enjoyed it. Danny and I agreed that we liked it more than Mansions of Madness.

A very good game, the Lovecraft mood is really present and the mechanicsa are pretty good, the caracters are a bit unbalanced, but in a cooperative game this is not a problem.

A solid co-opt game that does a good job of invoking Lovecraftian dread.  I find it has a stalling point after about 4-5 gates being sealed where you don't have the clues to seal more gates, but the Mythos deck keeps hitting the sealed locations.  As big as the game board is, however, publisher should have considered making places for many (if not all) of the cards on the board.  It would be nice if teamwork was required beyond coordination of actions.

CO-OP

Set aside a full Sunday afternoon for this one. Co-op game. Lots of rules. Odds are not in your favor. Just when you think you might be getting somewhere, you can get steamrolled.

But fun! Loads of theme and story telling. Fairly simple once you know all the options and rules (the instruction book is 20+ pages long). Might just be my favorite game. 

I really like the monster movement mechanic.

Game can be fun, but in some ways it is a bit tedious for what it is. We have a larger game group, and it's fairly easy to win, just takes a while to set up, play. Would be interested in seeing how the expansions add to the game play, but no personal interest in owning the game yet.

Fue una gran sorpresa. Es un juego que no es para todo el mundo pues si no entras en su mecánica y temática te puedes aburrir un buen rato. Pero si te gustan las mismas y el grupo con el que juegas también pasarás unas buenas horas de diversión. Su mayor defecto es cantidad de espacio que requiere con tantas ampliaciones y la duración tal vez sea un poco largo para lo poco complejo que es.

Aside from some issues with how the rules are laid out, this is a great game!  I've grown a little weary of the "clean" elegance of the euro-school lately.  Arkham Horror appeals directly to the role-player and fantasy lover in me.  Fiddly rules, exceptions, lots of cards and pieces, moving around, fighting monsters, going insane, great!  The other downside is length of time, but I'm willing to make the time for this one.  This also gets more playing time because it works fairly well with two - usually we play that each player just plays two characters.

(01-08-07) - I got to play this two times so far.  First game was really just a feeling out process as there are lots of rules to learn and remember.  Didn't finish the game but was interesting learning the mechanics.  The second game was much better as I was able to explain the rules clearly to the group.  Again the game wasn't finished but looking forward to giving it another go soon.

The only thing I don't like about this game is that it's a pain to set up and pack up, takes a lot of space, can be somewhat hard to learn and possibly takes the whole evening (and maybe night!) to play through.

Arkham Horror got us back into the gaming world.  It holds a special place in our hearts.  Even if we put it aside for a few months, we'll always come back to it.   

The base game by itself has become routine for us.  We know where most of the activity happens and can usually clean it up before anything major goes off.  Adding some expansions really brings the life back into this game.

We just played the shortest, most anticlimatic games of Arkham EVER!  Cthulhu never woke up (wasn't even half way there).  There were no monsters by the end of the game (caused by an environmental mythos card none-the-less).  Five gates were sealed, we won be closing all the gates (only one of which was not sealed, the last one).  Oh, and it was two-player.  We're just that awesome!

And then today we played a 5 hour long version of Arkham with two expansions.  We won though because we're still that awesome.

RATING: 1
What a bad game. Unless you like taking brain dead turns where your highlight is rolling the dice and hoping that they roll your way. STAY AWAY from this game.

It is also unnecessarily long, 4+ hours. If you like cooperative games where the only real cooperation that you do with the other players is hoping for them to get good rolls on their turn and talking about how good or bad your rolls are while someone is taking their turn rolling the dice, then this is your game!

The expansions basically consist of making this game longer and adding more random game elements to make the game more random than it already was.

My favorite is the deck of cards from the Innsmouth expansion. Basically, every turn you draw a card from this deck and the deck consists of 20 cards that all say the same thing.

"You dont have the look of Innsmouth about you."

One card says something different, "You Die."

This is an expansion for this already horrible and totally random game. You get to pull cards from this deck. When "You Die." you die. You discard everything that you were working on for the past 2 hours and start all over. What an awesome game right?! Dont buy this game ever. If you already have it DONT trade it or sell it and inflict it upon someone else BURN IT before someone else gets hurt by it.

One of my top 2 or 3 games.  I love the theme and the way the game really draws you in.  I feel connected with my character each time I play.  It has an almost epic feel to it and role playing your character is a blast.  The massive dice rolling gives it a nice "leave it up to fate" element that fits perfectly into the game.  The 3-4 hr. playtime is kind of a sweet spot for me.  I am almost always up to play it.

Unfortunately, this was a game I avoided because Lovecraft's mythos was completely foreign to me.  The artwork and co-op nature made me bite.  I was happy to find a well-rounded adventure game beyond my initial impressions.  With so many investigators, Ancient Ones, and encounters, no session plays the same twice.  

While the rules seem rather complex, I found that they were fairly easy to grasp within a play or two.  There is still a need to remember all the maintenance, but it doesn't kill the game if you forget here and there.  

I completed the collection by grabbing all the expansions.  However, I am still enjoying the base game too much and want to continue to explore as much of it as I can.

One of the greatest games of the modern gaming age. Also a bit of a money grab, but it seems like that's starting to be expected these days. Still, as long as your co-op group is fine with the idea of losing after a few hours of investment, it's a marvelous thing to attempt. I don't imagine I'll get tired of this game until I've mastered all the expansion boards, and I just don't see that ever happening.

This is a bear to teach and learn, which is usually not too big a deal with co-op games, expect to repeat yourself a lot when playing with new players. This is by far the game with the most components in my collection(with all the expansions) but with small player counts to keep play time down this game is fun and so SO thematic. Horror theme is pretty underutilized and of the few games that do have it as a theme even fewer actually evoke the feelings that good horror should, filling you with dread at every card draw and monster attack.

What I like about Arkham Horror (the newer edition) is the quality of the components and the wonderful flavor text. It really creates an immersive and enjoyable atmosphere. What I dislike about it is mostly the game itself. Its not terrible. Its just very old-style American, but not in the good way. Its incredibly long for what it offers. The amount of decisions you get to make is a lot smaller than it ought to be. You can have luck which will make it impossible to do certain things, even without you making any real decisions to impact one way or the other. 

That said, I'd be willing to play this if other players were really up for it. I think every so often it would be the right set of circumstances that I would really dig it. But I am glad I traded my own copy away, yet am able to enjoy a buddy's copy.

huge expectations for this game based on the IP, mythos, and major development of expansions... that falls flat on game play.

CONS

- large chunks of down time that is wasted time waiting for your turn because the actual "co-op" tactics of game play is, by and large, minimal... which leads to... fairly long game play for a not-so-epic experience (in an 8-player game we had one player wait 42 minutes between a turn.... the down time completely kills this game.

- monster movement based on card draw/symbols is kind of boring

- trading gate tokens for 5$/things... sounds realistic. "i just traveled into a nether-dimension and closed a weird-realism portal. i'd trade that life altering experience for 5 BUCKS." poor gate cost/benefit mechanic.

PROS

- Lovecraft made you a great mythos/IP

- decent challenge but laborious

possibly change score over time but after a handful of plays, score has dropped. more engaging co-op games out there.

This is a game my boyfriend classes as his "Go to" game. He loves it, and his enthusiasm is contagious. Although I had never heard of H.P.Lovecraft until I met him the theme of the game is fantastic. My boyfriend is great at teaching games, so although I know the rule book(s) are long (and apparently confusing) I have never had a problem. Defo one to try if you like theme games.

This game just plain rocks.
It has a very strong theme and story going for it and transports the lovecraftian Mythos very well.
The co-operative nature works like a charm as players have to work hard to try and beat the game.

It's hard to win, but it's lots of fun even when you lose. And the stories you get to experience are sometimes odd, sometimes fun, and sometimes downright creepy...

For such a fundamentally simple game, Arkham Horror is a rules nightmare the first time you take it out for a spin. For the one person who hasn't played this: Arkham is a co-op game where players attempt to evade or beat on Lovercraftian beasties, seal gates to otherworldly dimensions, and otherwise prevent the town from being destroyed by ancient demons from mysterious neighbouring dimensions.

The game mechanics in this are much simpler to explain than they are in practice: on a given turn each player can adjust their stats a bit, move around the town (possibly fighting or avoiding monsters in the process) and can collect various items, clues, status modifiers, allies, and so forth. At the end of each round, gates to other worlds attempt to open, unleashing monsters on the town and causing general consternation. If too many monsters show up, then bad things happen, and if too many gates open, the great old one shows up and all hell breaks loose. As I said, the game is fundamentally simple, but the original Chaosium engine is presumably in evidence here because the game is full of stat checks, niggly special circumstances, and ambiguities that have been dealt with in a mind-numbing 45 pages of rules questions here on the Geek.

All of this sounds quite dire, and I can see how this game could be a nightmare with the wrong group or pace. The game isn't fast, but it's not glacial, nor should it be. The game is playing you a lot, but that's the case with any co-op, from Lord of the Rings to Pandemic. The dice are evil and have stringent requirements that can screw you, but it tends to be standard fare for these types of games. I found myself enjoying the overall atmosphere and feel of the game even though I still don't know if I will ultimately feel like I'm actually playing the game more than having the game dictate logical paths where the dice will either be with me or against me. I would not want to play this with a big group, or probably even with more than 3, but at the smaller count it seems to work well, at least if the investigator number is adjusted to make the game manageable (i.e.: do not play with only 1 investigator if you're by yourself, I do not feel that 2 is insurmountable, or even problematic if the game goes your way, but with 1 it is nigh impossible). The atmosphere is good, and there are some interesting decisions about how to approach any given situation on the board. Again, success can often be dice or deck dependent, but this is more of an experience game than a serious game, so I consider that acceptable.

One major niggle I have is the battling the great old one to potentially win thing, which is not in flavour with the rest of the game. I prefer to play that the awakening of the GOO results in an auto-loss with no climatic combat, which is apparently the rule that was present in the original Chaosium version of the game. At small scales this seems to destroy the only advantage that the fewer number of players would otherwise have, but I would rather have the correct feel than a more balanced experience in this case.

If I have an actual gameplay complaint 6 games in it is that the game seems to be that the difficulty is largely based on familiarity. Several locations on the board have a much larger number of mythos cards opening gates at them, and once you start to become familiar with this, the game becomes easier as you can then wait for gates to open at such spots and seal them early, making the rest of the game much easier as monsters will stop spawning there. The game can still throw you curves along the way but it seems much more manageable with the aid of this familiarity, and I can see why people are interested in expansions that ramp up the difficulty as I have been consistently winning the game after a couple of troublesome early plays. (Yes, I have read the voluminous rules posts here, yes, I am playing the game correctly, trust me).

Ultimately, this game went down from a high of 7 to the 4 where it sits now. Mostly this comes down to 2 things: 

1) It has so many niggly rules that they will not all still be in your head if you're taking too many months off between games; we're talking reams of FAQs. This doesn't jive well with my general feeling that the game is too long for what it offers to play regularly.

2) In the decade+ since this game was released there are several better options available that scratch the same itch for me. Arkham Horror: The Card Game has very similar movement and theme, but much more interesting game mechanics and combat. Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition has all of the theme as well, but is much more accessible and easy to pick up after long breaks between plays. Both of the aforementioned also have a better, more cohesive narrative structure that immerses me more in the theme. With those 2 games in my collection there is really no way I could see ever dusting this one off again. Perhaps FFG will eventually app-ize this one ala Mansions of Madness to make it easier to approach, but I don't see myself playing this base game again unless someone needs an extra player and is ready to guide the game along (i.e.: knows all of the sub-rules so they can manage the game along).

This game often out stays its welcome.

Don't get me wrong I still love this game but I wish it would take an hour or two less to play.

If we could get the playing times down this game would get a 9 rating from me without hesitation.  I may be part of the problem I find my mind wandering after a while if there is no obvious progress.

After an average game of Arkham my mind is a little fryed this is certainly not an upside.

I am conflicted about trying to make it more of role playing experience by reading only parts of the encounter cards it causes guessing to replacing decissions and it slows play.

The best co-op game ever made.  Interesting, colorful, a fantastic re-invention of the classic.  The only problem?  The rules as written make the game too easy.  We've played over and over and win effortlessly every time.  So, play with a house rule that says there is a Mythos phase every 3 player turns and it should be more challenging.  Even easy, it's still a great game.

This game reminds me of Magic Realm (which I like very much).

Game combines role playing with board game mechanics.  Great theme, fun game play.

The rules aren't complex.  In fact, the rules make lots of sense, however, there are times when a situation comes up and you're not sure how to play it.  The FAQ are very good and detailed so most of the things that come up are quickly resolved.

I'll be playing this one for a while.  

Great game!

Likes: A fun theme-rich co-op game. There are enough choices that players can make their own decisions and not worry as much about group-think. It has quite an RPG-ish feel.

Dislikes: Setup and breakdown are a pain. The multitude of expansions doesn't help. In the end, it's still a solitaire game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A really great, on the edge of your seat game!
Either you all win, or you all lose!

I love this game and it's expansions!

The only thing is, the expansions do add rules and can be a chore to remember.  So I usually assign people different tasks for the Mythos to make it go smoother. (the first player still being the first player for the Mythos, just everyone helps it move along by doing the same things each mythos)
it can also be a long game to play. 2-4 hours, normally.  Though I have had shorter on rare occations.

This is still a really fun, great game!

*Edit*
So good I bought 4 copies!
One for the Dunwich Horror and Black Goat of the Woods
One for Kingsport Horror and King in Yellow
One for Innsmouth Horror and Dark Pharoh
and One for Dark Pharoh Revised and Lurker at the Threshold.

Yes.  I am crazy.

Update on 25 November, 2013.
Arham Horror is a milestone for me. It showed me the world of board games beyond Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne. I love the latter games, but I think Arkham Horror was my first ameritrash board game ever and still it's one of my favourites. It introduced me to this theme-heavy, and in this case complex genre.
We play the game with Dunwitch and Innsmouth expansions.

RATING: 10
I'm eating crow on this one, I initially thought this was an good game buyoed primarily by the Lovecraft theme but after 10 plays I think this game is tremendous in terms of an old fashioned, 1980s style adventure game.  Arkham Horror is clearly the best of that field chiefly due to the ridiculous number of interactions, possibilities, and variety the game offers.  Unlike any other board game, Arkham Horror creates a real world for the players to move about in and some great opportunities for collusion and cooperation that aren't immediately evident, largely due to a somewhat protacted learning curve.  After a few plays a level of familiarity sets in and the game moves from "good" to "great".  Two things should be noted however, one is that games with more than 6 players can be a disaster of downtime and completely unchallenging, therefore uninteresting.  Also, the high degree of variability means that some games are inherently more thrilling than others, but when it all clicks (which is really about 80% of the time) it's magical.  Black magical.  I still think the "fight the monster" endgame is bizarre and not really very Lovecraftian, but at least the redesign team saw fit to include Azathoth, whose attack is "Destroys the world".  Great dark humour, hopelessness, and insanity round out another terrific FFG production that puts just about everyone else to shame in terms of graphic collateral and design.  Top tier, all the way- the best adventure board game ever published.

A great co-operative game. I think the game is quite thematic and the gameplay inspires a lot of tension.

Probably a try before you buy for most people though.

I would rather play with a max of four people, as the downtime between turns is long and the length of the game can increase greatly with more. It scales well though and I enjoy playing with only 1 or 2 others.

The first non-Parker Bros./Milton Bradley game I ever owned. Huge Lovecraft fan and this game really delivers. Absolute classic.

This is one of my favorite co-op games. I love how hard the game is and how it's constantly stacking the deck against you. I really don't mind losing games of Arkham Horror just because I feel like I get something out of every game. 

It may not be an epic D&D-level story, but this game is great just for the experience.

Easily my most played game of all time. I'd estimate I've played it around 200 times so far, give or take a couple of dozen. While some of them have been slow or exhausting, there's no other game I know I'd rather play again and again. 

My favourite game, for its infinite replayability and its incredible power to amuse and excite me time and time again.

Didn't make the greatest of first impressions with us, as we found it impossible to win.  Turns out, the person teaching it to us was playing incorrectly (one mythos turn per player; not per round) and stacking the odds impossibly against us.  I would love another opportunity to play it again, correctly.  That said, Katie was rather overwhelmed by everything going on and the incredible difficulty pushed her over the edge.  She doesn't plan on ever playing AH again, so we might have to successfully work through Elder Sign and Mansions of Madness to pick this one up again.

Pozitívumok:
- gyönyörű
- szerepjátékos kivitelezés
- mindenki a "játék ellen", közösen harcol
- bármennyien játszhatjuk, mindig izgalmas marad!
- újrajátszhatósága a karakterek, főgonoszok, a helyszínlapok miatt magas (plusz a kiegésztők miatt is, de azok közül sajnos még egy sem jelent meg magyarul)

Negatívumok:
- még gyakorlott játékosoknak is bonyolult és nehezen megérthető (a szabályfüzet elég szerencsétlenül néz ki, ennél átláthatatlanabb játékszabályzattal még nem találkoztam), nemhogy ha olyanokkal játszunk akik nem annyira jártasak a játékok között (nekik nem is ajánlott)
- nagyon-nagyon hosszúra el tud nyúlni egy játék (ami egyébként nem feltétlen gond)
- a kockadobások, lapkafelhúzások miatt túl nagy a szerencsefaktor 
- eleinte nem így gondoltam de több játékkal a hátam mögött azt mondom: túlontúl sok a jelző.

Összegezve csak azoknak ajánlom akik ezt a Cthulhu világot nagyon szeretik, illetve akik nem fáradnak bele hogy az első pár menetet a szabályzatba bújva kell végigjátszani. Illetve csak összeszokott, gyakran összeülős társaságoknak ajánlom, akik bátran rá mernek szánni több órát.

Én sokkal többet vártam tőle - csalódtam benne. De még így is van olyan jó játék hogy örüljek hogy beszereztem és bármikor kapható vagyok egy játékra!! ;)

A hozzáállásom az utóbbi hetekben változott: egyre jobban élvezem a játékot, de érdekes módon még mindig van 1-2 szabályrészlet amiről megfeledkezünk és most három, de annál nagyobb hibát tudok mondani róla:
- túl sok mindenre kell figyelni
- kockadobálás dönt
- ha legalább 4-en játszunk túl simán győzünk

Játszási szám: kb. 20

I loved this game when we first got it.  I've since lowered the rating to reflect that it rarely hits the table.  Mostly, it takes too much time for what it is: random.  It can be fun with the right group.

Great game, but can be somewhat complex with the expansions.  I've only played this one solo, so that I can leave it set up and play over multiple sessions.  Not sure how I would like it with a large group.

Awesome!  This felt like a Lovecraftian Pandemic, with dice rolling for skill checks & stat modifiers.  Where I'm not a huge fan of Pandemic, I love this game.  It helps a bit that I was already familiar with the works of Lovecraft prior to playing.  This ties some things together beautifully.  First play = solo using 3 investigators and beat Cthulhu in final battle.

A good theme is spoiled somewhat by a poorly-written and confusing rulebook, as well as a play time that's longer than it really should be. A few event cards bog the game down, making it even longer. While there are decisions to make each turn, the game would be improved if the decisions were more meaningful. I think a clearer rulebook and a few houserules to speed up play could make Arkham Horror a game I'd want to play on a regular basis.

This game is a lot of fun. Despite the balance issues that have been constantly debated, there is a great game here. Its an experience you can enjoy because of the great bits, the fun game play, and the storylike atmosphere.

Arkham Horror is another one of those games that I stayed away from for too long.  For a longtime Lovecraft fan to not own this game is admittedly ridiculous – a mistake I have rectified only too recently.  I think, should this account one day be found and understood not as the ravings of a mad man but as a single being standing on the edge of a yearning abyss into chaotic nothingness, I have hardly delved as deep as I should.  That humankind should co-operate the face of such unworldly menace, I have no doubt yet my companions are often a querulous mix of unique personalities.  And this comment should not end without a quick mention of the words rugose, archaic, hoary and eldritch.

RATING: 5.5
If this game took an hour, I'd love it.  I've been a Lovecraft fan since I read "The Colour From Out of Space" in a science fiction omnibus from my dad's childhood.  As it stands though, the game is random, barely co-operative, and not nearly so challenging (without sinking more money and complexity into the expansions) as much faster co-ops.

RATING: 2
Suffice it to say I'm not the target audience. Is it then fair for me to rate it? Well, folks who I've played many games with thought I would, and I spent an evening on it (with some random expansion, which I didn't understand), and although I can't get those hours of agony back, I can at least write this. I can't think of any game I've played that I'd pick this over. 2 is generous, but I'm in a generous mood.

While i love H.P. Lovecraft, and I generally enjoy the game, the rules regarding combat and encounters leave much to be desired. Still, i find myself in a love/hate relationship with this game. Also, with a game so heavy on theme, there seems to be little to no character interaction/motivation.

Very good game but really shines when you add its expansions to it, preferably only one additional village (board) and as much smaller ones (cards-only) as possible.

Without expansions, the game is still good but its re-playability suffers a bit, there simply too few components so that players can remember the stuff, events and odds too well after several games.

I am part wargamer and part roleplayer. I exepct that if a game will last three hours that I can depend on something other than luck to guide my way. I had nine dice to roll a 5 or a 6, and did not. I should have rolled at least one. This game would benifit from the deck of dice.

I really enjoy this game.  A sign of a good game is a game that you think should have lasted longer and you have been playing for several hours.  Some people have apparently come up with strategies to beat the game, but my goal is to have fun.  So I run around and buy things and try to fight things and then get devoured.  I need to find a similar game with a different theme to play with my family.  I guess Shadows Over Camelot is the closest you can come.  But I like all the random weapons and spells and things in this (Similar to Runebound I guess)

I routinely make decisions in this game based on whether or not I think they fit with the theme.  I also lose at this game most of the time.

Apparently down time is the big killer of this game for me.  I don't like sitting around for a really big game of this.  Fewer, faster gamers would make this nearly perfect for me.

RATING: 6
A nice one every now and then, but probably not one that I need to own (although I've been tempted from time to time). Except for the flavor text and monsters, there is precious little Lovecraft feeling here. I'd even say that it's more of a David Eddings feeling (archetypal characters racing around, chasing one or more MacGuffins to defeat a big bad who is different every time, yet still surprisingly samey). OTOH, the only stuff which has given an HPL feeling has been De Profundis, Trail of Cthulhu and more or less freeform CoC. So as long as I keep my expectations to a fun romp, this is a pleasant diversion. Somewhat strange narrative arc from time to time, though, with much of the difficulty early on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I really don't understand everyone's obsession with the Cthulu mythos, and to play this game, given it's length, is much more of a chore if the theme doesn't interest you. It's a cooperative game where all players are attempting to prevent one of the Ancient Ones from breaking into this world, and you go around upgrading your characters and fighting smaller monsters while trying to close different portals around the board. The problem for me also would be that it's been so long since I've played that I would need some rules explanations at the start to even remember what we're doing. Overall, not really for me.

There are things I just can't get behind in this game. The first is the length. It feels way too long for what it is, I have the same complaint with BSG and I feel that the complexity the game tries to make gets in between you and the win condition of the game. And the second which ties into the first is the fact that this breaks one of my rules in Co-op games. If you know you are going to lose make the loss quick! Ghost stories does this excellently...you feel that you can indeed win until that moment when you realize you can't and then the game very quickly ends. On the other hand AH can both create situations that are actually statistically highly improbable/impossible to win in and second then make you play the game for another hour before you actually lose. That's just not fun

This is a great game! I played 1, 4, 5 & 6 player games & its just great! It pumps you up each round when gates & monsters & ... apear You re fighting a tough battle! It becomes increasingly hard, leaving you wonder how you can get trough it but still giving you Hope! I won that first (single player) game agains Yig (tough it was indeed Pure Luck). I only had one dissapointing game so far, where we had dissapointing gate openings (no new gates, a lot of monster respawns wich isnt really that impressive with 2 gates on the board..) Great rulebook too! Its a bit much to process but the its good enough not to have this bother you!

Have only played this a handful of times since I bought it, but I'm surprised at how much fun we are having with it.  The only problem I have noticed so far is purpose of the game.  What is it?  You are supposed to be working together, killing monsters and sealing gates.  In the end, the Ancient One will always awaken, forcing you to into battle in which you either win or lose the game.  It's inevitable and I don't like how this is always the end result.  The game seems a little too hard, but I will need to give it more plays.

Want an easier game? Let everyone choose their characters? Want a risky more difficult version? Pure randomness! We've been playing the heck out of this game every weekend. It is long enough to warrent snacks and a comfy seat, but doesn't take you multiple evenings. It requires effective cooperation, encourages self-sacrifice (for the good of the group) and oozes Mythos from every orifice. The fact that is is gorgeous and a blast to play tends to make up for the elements of card design and turn order that seem a little counter-intuitive.

Arkham holds a special place in my heart although I rate it lower now - this was my first real "designer board game" that was beyond Settlers of Catan.  Because I had and loved Arkham, I wanted to check out other games which led me down the rabbit hole :)

I am interested to check out Eldritch Horror and see how much it improves the game in terms of streamlining the "fiddleyness" and decreasing the playtime of the game. 

Older thoughts: I love the components, the character cards, the weapons, the monsters. I just feel like its too punishing, especially when it comes to fighting monsters.  If there's not a tankish character on the table (the gangster with a flamethrower comes to mind) then its easy to get wiped out over and over again.

At first, I thought this game was rather easy. But that was the "training" GOO's with Azathoth and Yig. The rest of them are horrible. Especially if you use the Heralds from the mini expansions appropriate to each GOO.  

It's a great game for fans of the Cthulhu Mythos, but it isn't quick. Shortest game was an hour and a half, excluding setup.

Lots of fun to be had in this game - each turn players are faced with a variety of choices.  The different roles add some nice flavor and this game has a really strong theme.  I think the only negatives are that you get more downtime as the number of players increase, and keeping track of all your pluses and minuses gets confusing.  But on the whole this game is solid and if you have the time to play you'll be richly rewarded; it gets in your head and it's an experience you won't soon forget.

Wow, where do I start? This game is epic! Dripping with theme and full of adventure. One of my all time favorite games.  I have all expansions and all the miniatures. I absolutely love this game

GAMEPLAY AND RULES NOTES:
-DEEP ONES RISING TRACK:  is on the Innsmouth Board. Add one Uprising Token each time a Gate is stopped from opening and when a Monster enters a Vortex Space on the Innsmouth Board. To remove Uprising Tokens investigators spend Clue Token in any location in Innsmouth. When the Clue track is full on the Deep Ones Rising Track both tracks are emptied.
-DELAYED INVESTIGATOR:  does not move, just stands up. Has Encounter still.
-ENVIRONMENT:  is a trait on some of the Mythos Cards. Environment Cards stay in play until it is replaced with a new Environment Card.
-EXHIBIT ENCOUNTERS:  Investigators in the same space as the Ancient Whispers Marker must have an Exhibit Encounter. Only one Exhibit Encounter is allowed per turn.
-PATROL MARKERS: Investigators make a Sneak +0 check or they are Arrested.
-RIFTS:   are on the Kingsport Board. Check movement symbols, if matches add a face up Rift Progress Token, if full Rift is spawned at the gate location of the active Mythos Card. If Rift moves spawn monster in new location. If move along arrow of same color. Add a Doom Token to Ancient One. To close Rift have an encounter at all 4 shown locations on the Rift Progress Markers.
-VORTEX SPACES (Dunwich):  are on the Dunwich Board. If a Monster moves into Vortex Space, it is returned to the cup. Terror Level is increased by one and add a Dunwich Horror Token to the Dunwich Horror Track.
-VORTEX SPACES (Innsmouth): are on the Innsmouth Board. If a monster moves into a Vortex Space, it is returned to the cup. Terror level is increased by one and add an Uprising Token to the Deep Ones Rising Track.

ANCIENT ONE NOTES:
-EIHORT: Use Brood Tokens stored with Mask Monsters.
-GHATANOTHOA:   Use the Ghatanothoa's Visage Tokens stored with Mask Monsters.
-QUANCHIL UTTAUS: The dust cards are stored with the Mask Monsters.
-SHUDDE M'ELL:   Rubble Markers are stored with the Mask Monsters.
-ZHAR:   Use the Zhar Token stored with Mask Monsters.

VARIANTS:
-Difficulty Cards:   Total, 2 Easier, 2 Harder, 1 Neutral
-Epic Battle Cards:   Shuffle 12 Green on top of 12 Red and locate 3 cards the correspond with current Ancient One. Draw ONE Epic Battle card every Upkeep Phase during final battle.
-Gaurdians:   Assist the Investigators. Easier
-Heralds:   Increase by preparing the way for the Ancient One. Harder
-Institutions:   Assist the Investigators. Easier
-Personal Story:   Each player gets 2 Personal Story cards that correspond with their Investigator. Could be good, could be bad.   Neutral 
-STARTING RUMOR:   Dance of the Damned, during set up start with this card in play. (Stored in the Heralds box.)  Harder

Like:

-The mood and theme.
-The components are wonderful, as would probably be expected.
-The personality behind the many investigators and GOOs which really make me want to try tons of combinations.
-The mechanics feel solid, and I particularly appreciate the combat.

Don't Like:

-How hard it is for me to teach this game (could totally be my problem).
-Sessions that end too easily are not satisfying.
-An investigator being controlled by a stubborn gamer can spell doom for the whole squad.
-The potential time investment really keeps this game from hitting the table more often.  What a shame.

I love me some Lovecraft and games of epic proportions like Arkham. That being said, it is nothing less than an event to play this game and it is hard to get others wanting to play it because of the time it takes to tackle. I love it however--I would personally rate it as one of my favorite games, but I can't due to no one ever wanting to play with me.

This game is one of my favorites if played as it should be. As an epic thematic experience with your friends in a dimmed room with some lit candles. The theme is all over the place and outweighs some of the poor mechanics. I have a soft spot for these kind of thematic games and therefore I like Arkham a lot. It can drag a bit though and i probably wont play it with more than 4 players. Also the final fight is the one thing i really hate about this game and it should be avoided.

I can’t express how much I enjoy this game.  It was one of the first boardgames I purchased when I just got into the game scene of the boards.  I’ve played with two and I’ve played with six people and every time I’ve had a complete blast playing it.  We go into it like a committee, so we never get the leader syndrome I see in other peoples plays; we also fall into the theme of the game.  We’re usually explaining what Dexter Ward is doing or how Amanda Sharpe found the King in Yellow once more.  Once you fall into the story you’re creating the game opens up and you enjoy it even if the worlds crumbling around you.   
  
The base game, after all the plays I’ve done, can seem tame.  It goes by at a good pace, and even without the extras I can still see myself enjoying the game. 
 
As long as you enjoy theme and really get into it, I don’t know how you wouldn’t like this game.

I do not like it - it is just atmosphere and coolness. It tries to be narrative - but there are better games for that out there!

Pros:
-Cooperative game
-The theme is very immersive
-The Battles against Ancient ones are epic
-No 2 games are alike (great diversity of cards & events)
This is probably Arkham's greatest point: the potential is great and no 2 games are alike. The quantity of items, of Mythos cards and of expansions (and therefore more of every cards) is the biggest I've seen so far.

Cons:
-Takes a long time to set-up
-Fiddly.

Overall:
This is one of my top cooperative game out there. It is one notch above Pandemic in complexity, potential and depth, although it does lack the easy-and-quick-to-play aspect. A choice better suite to those who appreciate complexity and replay value in a game.

The thing with a lot of FFG games is that they are so pretty you forget that there is a real game beneath all of the chrome.  AH requires some careful planning if you want to win, but it is quite a meaty game.  Decent solitaire play, as well.  Gosh that sounds geeky.  ;-)

Very much an experience game, and one I'm happy to share with friends for the sake of spending time with those friends. The game proper, I find to be excellently thematic, but very long, and without nearly the level of strategy I tend to prefer in my games.

RATING: 7
Good game, but can be kind of long, especially towards the end of a game where your team is going for a gate sealing win. You can usually see that type of win coming but it can take much time to just go through the motions. Definately split up jobs between players such as reading encounter cards and managing the bank or your brain will fry. The co-operative element is very refreshing for a group like ours that is normally very cut-throat.

My first Ameritrash, and soon fall in love. The way I could devise a story while playing is something that drawn me so much into this game. The feeling, the tension, the genius mechanism.

RATING: 6
A fun cooperative game for those Lovecraft-ian fans out there. If you feel like travelling back in time (sometime in the 1920s), and taking up arms against an Ancient Evil, who is the Almighty Cthulhu, then this game is definitely for you! Gametime is a bit rough though. This game runs for 3-4 hours of non-stop dice rolling, card drawing, portal closing mayhem.

RATING: 10
Complex, long, tough cooperative game but very thematic and enjoyable, even if you get devoured by the Ancient One!  

Made by Fantasy Flight Games so the artwork is awesome and the components are well made.  (The board is large though so you need a lot of room).  

It can take a while to set up (15-20 minutes for the base game) but that could probably be improved with some clever storage.

I love thematic games and Arkham Horror has this in spades.  This game sure does create a fantastic immersive narrative.

Arkham is great to play with some music by Nox Arcana playing in the background.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: Great artwork on durable components. There are a few things I would change here or there, but mostly the components are functional and make great strides to convey the game's theme.

Experience: Not terribly fun with just one player (my first game). Lots of referring back to the rules, and a little bit lonely wandering around the monster-infested streets all by myself. The variety of locations, monsters, and Mythos cards ensures a lot of variable choices per turn. I'd like to play again with more players.

I don't really like this game, however depending on which final boss is in play and the makeup of the players it is sometimes fun.. Other times the players are completely dominating the game and you just have to kill time to reach the final battle(Not much fun).  also if the players dont have a good mix of skills and the wrong boss is in play the game is unwinnable and boring.

RATING: 5
Wanted to love this one so much, but it just didn't do it for me.  In my opinion, a game based around pulp horror stories should be quick and elegant, and AH is neither of these things, even without bringing in the umpty-seven expansions available.  Eldritch Horror & Elder Sign both let me scratch that Lovecraftian itch, in much smaller and cleaner packages.

RATING: 8
Tons of replayability here, as the varied characters, locations, and stories that play out will be very different from play to play.  Great sense of theme, and once the rules are learned (rulebook can be a chore), turns can go pretty quickly.  Love the cooperative aspect and the challenge of the game... this is not an easy win, as a great coop game should be.  Getting your tail kicked just makes you want to play again!

Fun game to play with 2 people. The large number of characters, spells, monsters, and so on to choose from, I can't see how you'd end up with the same game being played. I've read people saying that down time is long but I think that since this is a cooperative game, you should get involved with everyone's turn. It's always up to the person playing the character to make the final call. I'm enjoying this one a lot and so is the wife so I may actually get her into playing this one. ;-)

There are those who wouldn't like AH, and there are valid reasons why.  However, for the type of player looking for the kind of thing AH sets out to provide, AH does a remarkably good job.  AH is an attempt at simulating the experience of playing a Call of Cthulhu Role-Playing Game session, and it does a spectacular job of this.  I'm sure RPG players have had many less satisfying RPG sessions than the average game of AH ( I know I have! ).  I found the theme incredibly consistent, and whereas I previously thought the game had TOO many cards and bits, etc. it turns out these are all really necessary to fully flesh out the theme and world that the game provides.  There are problems in the games design - it runs too long (but with repeat plays we might be able to get the games down to 2 - 3 hours - our first game took 5, including a long rules explanation from a vet) and perhaps it is too easy to win with the base rules (we won first try, but we may not have played all of the rules correctly, either).

I do enjoy an evening of Arkham.  Sometimes the game just dumps on you from the first turn.  Sometimes you actually get somewhere - here and there you actually beat it.  But I've always enjoyed the insane little journey your investigator goes on before doom occurs.  Our group enjoy this coming out because we all get to laugh at each other being put through the mill before taking our own go at being subjected to all manner of lunacy.  If your requirements are "hey - let's all play a game that we are highly likely to lose through random events, but it will just be funny and cause laughter!" then this fits the bill.
I would never add more than one expansion at a time though.  Each expansion adds a particular theme and mixing them all up would be like trying to read all of the Lovecraft stories at the same time.  Or listening to all your favorite songs played at the same time.  Or having chicken and beef and pork and key lime pie all in the same sandwich. It's just going to get confusing and you'll wish you hadn't.

Is a cooperative game but I think that does not have the requirements to be an excellent cooperative game, because there is no difficulty in choosing the action to take. For example Hanabi is a cooperative solid game because the player needs help from other players in getting information. To me this game would make more sense if each character had a personal goal, making the game a semi cooperative.

This is my personal #1 game. I own many games, and have played a full spectrum of Euros, thematic, dice fests, etc. I enjoy all types of games. Yet through many years of games, many different types of games, AH remains my top choice!!!

The first few playthroughs can be daunting, so I try to get the board setup before players outside my family show up. If you're considering this game, try to find a group that is experienced with it. The rules can be a bit fiddly, so having someone experienced to run the game is a MUST!!!

As an update from 2007, I've changed my rating from 8.5 to 10 based on dozens of plays. This is mainly due to the fact that my wife will now join my son, daughter and I in the game (a superb FAMILY co-op game). We really enjoy it, and I've since purchased all of the expansions (including revisions of expansions). 

My youngest son, now 7 joins us at trying to stop the evil that lurks in the darkness...For a family fun, co-op game, buy it NOW!!!!!

I liked the original Arkham Horror, however this one has some great thematic and gameplay improvements and the components are absolutely gorgeous (with reams of brilliant artwork). Sadly, if you just have the base game its fairly easy to "solve" which gates to seal, making the game can be easier than it should be. I'd highly recommend the Dunwich Horror expansion which improves some of the overall difficulty balance. Plays long.

"Accounting: The Boardgame". Fiddly, complex setup (a LOT of bits), and takes a ton of space. Once you get used to it, it becomes much easier. Each turn consists of a whole bunch of tiny details to take care of. On the upside: everyone's involved all of the time. Downside: they're involved in doing tiny, almost meaningless actions. This is especially true if you get sucked into a gate -- so much for your next 2 turns, but you'll still have to pay attention. There are still many decisions to make, and several paths to victory, but overall the game feels hollow to me. Takes forever when you're learning. You can play two or three shorter, more fun games in the same time as one big AH game.

Great full-coop game that suffers when you add too many players or large expansions. Tons of atmosphere.

My favorite cooperative game. It has lots of dice rolls, so the purists of strategies and analysis should be aware: the dice has its role. 
But every game makes you feel the urge to seal portals, the monsters coming, what you're doing in role-playing vein, and this to me is very important. I usually accept every game offer to play Arkham Horror. Dunwich Horror is very suggested also...

Finally got to play at Origins 2010.  First game was 4 hours...we didn't complete but did do a final boss mode to experience it.  Next day played again and just after 40 minutes we hit boss mode and won by a technicality where one character could keep both him and another with magic alive while the rest of were shield...still... not too bad!

RATING: 3
Heavily reworked edition of the Chaosium co-operative play classic. While there are enough elements of the original design to make it obvious what game it is a remake of, it is not a faithful copy. The game is much darker and just not as much fun. The game has beautiful artwork (much better than Chaosium's original - probably the only thing that is better in this game when compared to the original), wretched rules, and some serious gameplay issues. The game does not scale gracefully - do NOT try to play it with eight players (despite what the box says). The endgame just does not work - it is too long.

After having tinkered with the game rather extensively (including buying and trying one expansion), I have given up. This is certainly not the game I expected, and it is a crying shame. Of course, I know that others love this new edition, which is good for them. I recently played the original and that experience convinced that I needed to return to playing the original and, in trading this one off, I now have.

The game has its merits--it's deliciously thematic, well balanced, and has some clever mechanics.  However, it leaves me cold for some reason.

Verdict: play someone else's copy, but don't bother to buy.

I used to really like this game. After each later co-op and adventure games i tried, i find i liked those games much better than Arkham Horror.
As a consequence, i'd rather play Pandemic, Gears of War, Death Angel, Ghost Stories for co-ops and for adventures, give me Android or Middle Earth Quest over this anytime.

Just not my cup of tea anymore i guess. I would still play it (my wife still likes it), but i get less enjoyment than i used to.

EDIT: played it again. It strikes me that there's so many different aspects of the game that are never used. What's the point of having encounters at "Ma's boarding house" when the only reason to go there is to spend tokens to get an ally... which will result in you NOT getting an encounter. That's true for almost all green locations... which is half the board.
And the numerous cards such as the "silver twilight lodge membership" cards, that we see only once in a blue moon being used. There are tons of those cards and even whole decks of cards from some expansions that have NEVER, EVER been used.
Too many components, too many useless game elements.

I'd still play it, but secretly wish we were playing something else.

RATING: 9
Arkham Horror is one of my favourite games and the most thematic game that I have played. There is so much replayability here that it is ridiculous. The base game alone might get boring after a while but an expansion or two . After almost thirty games I'm still seeing new things happen in this game that I have never seen before. I also have a deep affection for the Cthulhu mythos and that combined with the way the game creates stories makes this one a real winner for me. Don't go in waiting for a strategy game - play this one for the story and enjoy the fifth turn in row that you spend lost in time and space.

The problem with Arkham Horror is that it's too long, it's too fiddly, and sometimes the game cuts off any hope of winning after 3 hours so you give up. The great thing about Arkham horror is the story it tells. This was replaced by Eldritch Horror in my collection--less fiddly, takes less time, and it's still fun even if you know you're going to lose.

RATING: 5
Towards the end of the game, with closed portals obstructing some openings, the game became a lot easier.

I like the change in difficulty but becoming easier makes the ending almost an anti-climax, with victory becoming increasingly assured, rather than , say, thunderstone co-op, which becomes more difficult thanks to the guardian and makes for an engaging ending.

I like a bit of a denouement but not over the entire game!

We became increasingly tired/disengaged but this may be because we weren't yet so familiar with the rules.

The best features of this game are that it allows for a large number of players, and that players can work together but still have a sense of autonomy.  It's unfortunate that it can take so long to finish a game, but the more you play this the more proficient you get at making the turns run quickly.

A great mythos behind the game.  There is a very desperate feeling to the game, trying to seal gates and whatnot while battling monsters--all with the knowledge that a Great Old One is waiting in the wings to come devour the world.

The game works best when people have an understanding for the Cthulhu mythos--meaning this works for few people.  In addition to that, there are a lot of rules, and it requires a lot of time to play.

Arkham Horror hasn't hooked me like I thought it might.  There's too much downtime and players can really get stuck doing a specific task for the duration of the game.  Shadows over Camelot suffers from that same issue but the game length is significantly shorter.  For its length I'd much rather play Descent.

This is a really fun game for a more advanced board gamer.  Great for the Co-op group mindset.  The atmosphere of the game is very nicly delivered and the game play helps solidify the ambiance.  This game can be challenging for begining gamers, but is a great game for people looking for more of a challange.  As a warning you do need A LOT of table space to play this game!!!

I like big games and this is, by sheer amount of bits, no doubt the biggest game I own. So why only a 7?
Well, one thing bothers me. Clues and exploration. I know, it's an integral part of the core game, but...
"I wonder what goes on down the docks..."
"Don't bother, go to the woods. There are two clues we need."
I like the stories, but exploration ends up being forced into a frantic run for clues. And since you end up hurting everyone's chance of winning if you go to the docks anyway just to see, there is not much incentive to explore freely.
In the end there are just so many cards you end up never getting to read.

Played this solo a few times now and this game has kicked my a$$.  Can't wait to get a chance to play this with others.  Trade interest fairly low, but a game I can only get to the table maybe once a year is going to be one that is perpetually on the chopping block.

I would just give this a 10, but the fiddliness of the ten thousand components and the less than perfect rulebook take it down a couple notches.  Also I'm afraid it may wear out its welcome in another 20-30 playings.EDIT - OK, down to an 8 now.  The bloom is off the rose, but it's still a very nice rose!  SECOND EDIT - OK, down to a 6.  I'm just not finding myself wanting to play this very often, there's a little resistance in me when it gets suggested.  And yet, I still enjoy it when we do play.

Half the horror is finding a huge table, setting it up, trying to remember all the rules, and putting it away. Got more interesting with expansions but also just broke under the weight. Would rather do Eldritch Horror at this point.

RATING: 7
Cooperative game in which each player is a character with specific skills (speed, sneak, fight, will, lore, luck) which can be adapted (within limits) during upkeep. They start with a number of items and can collect more of them during the game. These items are used to fight against all the monsters which enter Arkham through gates to other dimensions. The objective of the players is to close and seal all gates that are opening during play, before the Ancient One awakens. If the latter happens, they have to fight against this "end-boss" in order to win the game. Players and monsters move in the streets and locations of Arkham, and through the gates to locations in other dimensions. In all these locations the players have encounters (can be good or bad). In a lot of the locations in Arkham players can choose to trade in monster or gate trophies to avoid an encounter and instead perform a specific action (recover stamina or sanity, obtain money...).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A bit too fiddly -- I'm sure I've not yet played this properly.  But it's still fun with a group that's into the theme and willing to work together.  It also scales extremely well, which means I carry it to more gaming days than most other games.  Still, it can bog down when you have to look up again some obscure rule in the opaque rulebook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The learning curve is quite intense, and takes some time to teach.  Also, there were too many expansions which all add additional game rules which is all a little too much for this casual gamer.  Otherwise, this game is amazing.  And assuming I don't have to explain every nuance to a room full of new players I am always in the mood to play.  Eldritch Horror was recently released as a successor and has a lot of interesting global travel elements and a simplified mechanic, but the earth map board is super boring.  Even though it's nearly ten years older, I still find the city layout of Arkham offers increased realism over the globe trotting sequel.  A future release with the global focus and the simplified mechanic of eldritch, but adding playable city maps for each location in the game while maintaining complexity at a reasonable level - That would be perfection.

I love the theme that permeates throughout this game, and I actually got big into H. P. Lovecraft after picking this up (so I owe it a big thanks for that). 

I still need a few more plays to see how it holds up, but right now I'm really impressed by how much this game feels like a video game RPG translated to cardboard. On the other hand, there don't seem to be that many interesting choices to make in the game, it takes too long to play, and there are too many rules to remember.

This game didn't live up to the hype for me.  I don't relate to the theme, the combat system is overly complex, there are way too many bits and cards to sort, shuffle and keep track of, and the solo game is way too difficult.  That said, it does have a nice story feel to it, race against time, and replayability. Spellcasting is terrible and rarely worth using. Frustrating as it's difficult to plan for anything. Characters have six abilities they need to focus on, but because these abilities are all paired the increase of one will decrease another. The problem is each encounter will test one of these and you never know which one, so it's a crap shoot. One part of the game I enjoy the most is moving around the map to the different locations in Arkham to collect items, clues, receive healing, blessings, become deputy, etc. If I were at all interested in Cthulhu as a theme, I could overlook the mediocre gameplay, but as it stands I cannot. Traded for Die Macher, which is a much better fit for my gaming tastes.

Awesome substitute when you can't meet your RPG buddies for a Call of Cthulhu; there are a ton of counters to mess with, cards (equipment and skills) are really small and you need a large play area only for the base game... Anyway, it is a really tense game and each expansion adds a lot to the gameplay.

RATING: 6
The monster movement seems much fiddlier than Eldritch Horror, especially when the map gets flooded with them due to one of the expansions that was played. Still, a very fun thematic game as long as players take quicker turns. After playing this, I can say that both games do not play well with a large player count and slow players.

I have a really hard time understanding why Arkham Horror is so extremely popular. It takes a lot of time, it has very little strategy (too many random elements) and it's unnecessarily complex in almost every game mechanic.

To be perfectly honest, I don't think it's a very good game at all. If it wasn't for the theme, it wouldn't have much speaking for it at all.

RATING: 8
I personally loved this game, being a H.P. Lovecraft fan, and an avid board gamer, the first time I played it, I caught on much quicker than I expected, and fell in love.  HOWEVER, the big problem is that games are best enjoyed with other people.  I do understand this has a single player option (which I played a handful of times), but I play board games to play with others, so single player board games don't keep my interest.  That's where the problem came in for me.  Nobody else liked this game.  Too complicated, too long, too difficult.  I disagreed on all fronts, but in the end, I ended up selling the game as it never made it to the table after the first week.  Sad. . .

Played through twice. Just seems for the length of time this game usually runs [even with just three players], the end result is not fulfilling for me. This is a cooperative victory game [although there are rules for being the 'first' citizen of Arkham], and it just doesn't feel as much an accomplishment when the game resolves. I'd much rather play 21 consecutive games of battle line in the time it takes to finish this behemoth.

RATING: 7.5
Good co-op game that is fairly dense ruleswise without being very complex. Means you might miss the odd rule or two for a bit and it can take a little time to get runing smoothly. Black goat expansion makes it a bit tougher which is nice. Locations could still use a little more variation. One of the most FAQ'd games I'v played just due to the lack of clarity or rule coverage around some interactions.

Can be fun, depending on what monsters and cards are in play.  After about an hour, though, it starts to become an unmanageable mess, with far too many rumor cards in play at once.

I liked the idea of the theme but that's where any interest I had in the game stopped. The mechanisms in the game are overly complex and players will spend so much time on bookkeeping activities that it really removes the theme from the game. Some gates have a well known probability of opening and thus should always be the target of the investigators first. Monsters move through the streets seemingly random and can easily be avoided. The movement through the other world feels like they just gave up at that point (each turn move one space) because they already had 30 pages of rules. I wouldn't play this again.

Enjoyable theme. So desperate at times, on the cusp of losing, that it makes it fun. If only it didn't take quite so long to play.

Having played even more, it is not a good game with more than 4 players. The length of play and setup is getting more annoying. The rules are very fiddly and definitely detract from the game when new players are there as they constantly need help grasping them all. It's disappointing seeing this game lose its enjoyment for me. I need to try it again with 3 or 4 players and only people who have played. It might hit my trade/sell pile.

Although it has a big footprint and there's alot of rules(2 playthroughs and we had it down) I simply can't wait to play again...Whoa! After some checkin' on the BGG rules forum turns out the rules are a little more daunting than first appears but who cares AH still rocks even when playing it wrong. A more thorough knowledge of the rules made the game, at least for me, a bit easier and even more enloyable.

RATING: 2.5
Way, way, way too long and repetitive, repetitive, repetitive.

The first problem with the game is deciphering how to play, since the ruleset and rulebook are both a bit squirrelly. I could overlook that, however, as I have with some other games (Phoenicia and Bridge Troll, for example).

But the next problem is that, once you've got the rules down, you're really just moving from place to place over and over again and rolling dice over and over again. (For a loooooong time.)

Frankly, this game stands or falls on the narrative and the theme. As we played Arkham Horror, cards with story elements were drawn, but what little narrative they did provide was disjointed, sometimes contradictory, and toward the end of the game began to be repetitive. I cannot imagine playing this game repeatedly and getting anything whatsoever from the narrative.

I find that these sorts of boardgames generally fail to have any theme immersion or coherent narrative. I've got a huge past history of playing RPGs (D&D, certainly, but [family=276]Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay WFRP1 and WFRP2[/family] extensively)... and compared to those experiences, these games pale in comparison.

In short, Arkham Horror is "[family=814]Call of Cthulhu[/family], Jr."

If you want a big, immersive horror game, then this is probably it.  It is huge, so you really need a big table for the board and all of it's card decks.  There is also a sweet spot with the number of character to play, so play more each if you have only a few players.

After more than 50 rounds of playing (with expansions), I have to say: One of the best Games ever. When compared to its successor "Eldritch Horror" I just say, that Eldritch is more streamlined and faster to play, but Arkham still has a little bit more theme and emergence, due to the tight space in one city. Both are excellent though.

Rules are a nightmare which is only fitting for a game set in a nightmarish world. Don't play it with more than 5 players and you'll be fine. This was my first "meaty" game that I've bought and it still holds a special place in my heart. Shame it doesn't get played more often.

RATING: 9
>>>The only reason I can't give this a ten is that it can occasionally drag a little & is very group dependant. It can often be a great experience though, bringing more memorable moments than most plays of your average eurogame. I'll not likely turn down a game too often.

>>After my first 5 player game I can definitely say it needs everyone to be involved in the theme as 1 or 2 people not getting into it can really kill the fun in this game more than any other I've played.  
 
With the right group this can really be a lot of fun.
 
 Not one for the Eurogamer purist.

>After a couple of 2 player games I've raised this to a 9. It just has a very high fun factor which far outweighs any unbalances/randomness. Obviously needs everyone to be getting into the spirit of it for it to play at its best. 

Only played solo so far (near impossible with one investigator), but its been a lot of fun. Dripping with theme its a great adventure/horror/RPG-lite for those willing to get into the spirit of it. It appears to be everything I hoped it would be - which is lucky because I bought both expansions at the same time. :)

Really an awesome game, my only quibble is the fun vs time to setup/play/takedown is a bit off.  If the game was a bit faster and a bit less fiddly with piles of cards and bits it would move up to a 9 or a 10.

In the time I can setup, play, and take down Arkham I could have played 2 or 3 games that are just as fun or (when added together) overall more fun.

I wish I had a room in my house to lay out Arkham Horror and constantly have a game set up.  Playing solitaire is very satisfying, but it is much better with a group of four so you can laugh about the various exploits.

RATING: 8
What kills this game for most people is the play time.  An experienced crew can easily throw this down in under 2 hours, but there's a learning curve to get there.  The key to enjoying the game is to understand that each person essentially has a choice between 3 actions: beef up your character, kill monsters, and work on a gate.  It's not a hard decision, but new players get lost in the details.  The second thing that is required to speed up play is that each player needs to be assigned a bookkeeping role (move monsters, flip cards, etc.).

RATING: 6.5
I really enjoy the mythos, and I really like the idea of playing the game.  However, the game sometimes falls short and becomes monotonous.  I think I would reach for A Touch of Evil or the Witch of Salem before this.  Playing with people stricken with AP can completely ruin this game.

This was an absolute blast on one play. I can't wait to try it again, or to steal someone else's copy and play a solitaire round. Good stuff!

After two more plays this weekend (one solitaire), this is a definite winner. Would be a 9 if it didn't take so damn long to set up and fiddle with!

A game I didn't care much at first. The more I played it, the more I realized the numerously possibilities present to help the player. Can't wait to see how the expansions will interact with this title.

The more I play, the more I find the experience enjoyable.

RATING: 5
A repeative grinding 80s classic. OK, its the 2005 version, but it still feels like I'm playing the original with way too much dice rolling, random tile drawing, dice rolling, rules checking, dice rolling, etc until its time to see if we won or not.
Its not so much a game as an activity much like watching TV. Minimal decisions and control.

RATING: 8
Love the Lovecraftian Mythos theme, as I am fan of Lovecraft for years. It was however replaced, for me, by Eldritch Horror, which is streamlined and allows me more to immerse myself in the theme. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Another game that I really wanted to like. Gorgeous components, and artwork. I'm a big Lovecraft fan, so the theme was exciting and fun. 

With that said, I found the game too fiddly. This game is a table eater - And I live in a small studio so there we always had to deal with a space crisis. Too many pieces and parts to keep track of. Chits litter everything like party confetti. I shudder to think of the space required to play with 2+ expansions thrown in.

The theme is completely lost to all the book keeping you need to do. "Ok, it's the X phase. Time to move this chit here, and roll this die."

Traded for: Nexus Ops, and Manhattan

Hrrm.  I think I like this.  Actually kind of interesting.  Couple problems though.  Long as all hell.  After strange aeons and whatnot.  Also, as you might expect, the dice introduce a hyper-random, hyper-annoying element to the whole thing.  The cards and board are nice though and the gate/other world system is cool.  UPGRADE.  We finally finished a game!  You know, it was worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Absolutely one of the best cooperative board game, and one of the most engaging board gaming experiences ever.  The inverse pairs of adjustable stats is a stroke of genius.  My 4-year old loves playing this with me; obviously I read his cards for him and tell him what they do, and make various suggestions about too-subtle things for him, but he really gets into it, understands how the stat sliders work, knows the full 3-turn procedure for closing a gate, etc.  Plus if he gets too antsy, I can always finish the game myself.  :-)

Would be a 10 if it was a bit shorter.

Edited slightly in wake of BSG. :-)

And downgraded a bit in the wake of Eldritch Horror.

RATING: 10
I have played this game almost 100 times.  One minute I have complete control of Arkham...4 gates sealed, all monsters defeated...for the moment.  Then a monster surge occurs, extra monsters join in from an arctic expedition, and wounded heroes are caught in the street by flying monstrosities.  The game turns to chaos...exactly as it should.  Can the heroes rebound and turn back the tide?  Any game that you can lose yourself in for 4 or 5 hours and not notice the time...is the definition of a good game.  I do not think the expansions are as good...but this original game is one of the best.

RATING: 8
Lots of fiddly bits and becomes a tad formulaic in its gameplay. But the theme is overwhelming and awesome, and there have been some truly epic fights that have played out. +1 that it plays well solo. Playtime is on the longer side and doesn't get much use nowadays. This has a special place in my collection for being the first heavy board game purchase.

RATING: 7.2
THE classic treatment of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos from Fantasy Flight - has a reputation as difficulty to teach, learn. Dripping with theme... and the blood of those who dare oppose the Old Ones. Tentative rating... may be better than it seems.

It might change if I played it more but most of my games go slow, and it really just discourages me from playing. I need to try it with more people that know the game to keep the speed up or with a lower number of players, playing more characters to keep everyone in the game and focused.

Great game that I have played many, many times. I love the fact that the game is team oriented and you can play with as few or many player as you wish. Problems with the game are that it is reasonably complex to the point that the first few games, I did not play and acted as a Game Master of sorts organizing everything not related to the players. Also, if you are not a Lovecraft fan, it is hard to explain the game to new players.

RATING: 6.5
I'm a big Lovecraft fan, so the theme made this a "must buy." I love the co-op mechanics too. I need more plays and perhaps an expansion or two before I make up my mind on how much I like this game. The base set seems a bit...I don't know if repetitive is the right word and tedious is too strong a word...but it's just a little off for me. Oh, and the FFG rules could stand to be reorganized some, which I may do at some point for the house copy here....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
OMG!, what have I gotten myself into?  This game is addictive, but it takes so darn long to play!  It's hard to learn, hard to teach, and very difficult to beat, but, I love it!  
Having tried it solo,  I find it to be much less satisfying than group play, but at least I did win.

Overall, a great game.  I just wish the rules were a bit clearer, as I'm pretty sure that, after 9 games played, we still haven't played it exactly correct yet.

Well, I usually game at my friend's house, and he owns a copy of this.  I've only tried it solo once, and I don't think I'm going to do it again. So there it sits collecting dust and taking up valuable space on my limited gaming shelf. A cost/benefit analysis clearly shows the need to trade this, so on the block it goes.

The only co-op game I truly enjoy, mostly because it doesn't feel like a co-op until the end.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice cooperative fun, certainly captures some of the essence of Lovecraft. I always enjoy it, but sometime feel that the same thing will probably happen no matter what I do and it just comes down to the cards. Still I suppose that's thematic in it's way too. I'm a big Cthulhu fan so I can't rate it too low :)

I am a big Lovecraft fan, used to play a lot of the Call of Cthulhu rpg, and this game really scratches my itch for that sort of experience.
The flavour text is nicely done, the mythos lore is pretty accurate and comprehensive, and if played with the right crowd, this game is really awesome. 
For me, personally, that means people that play it mostly for the experience and the narrative that the players and the game engine create, win or lose (of course we always try to win, but hey, those Old Ones are pretty darned gnarly).
Min-Max'ers that play the game mechanically, and don't even bother to read out the cards in an ominous way need not apply.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
You need to get yourself into the mindset that you are actually playing an interactive story as opposed to a game. Possibly the absolute opposite of a euro - it's all mechanics, rules and theme. There is some strategy but it's almost not the point - the best approach is to role play the character within the mythos of the game.

Is still lots of fun especially if you like Lovecraft/Cthulhu. 

Update (17/06/09): I am tempted to udge this up a notch or two. Once you have the rules completely sussed the mechanical nature of the game dissappears and the game really starts to flow - same as any game I guess, but particularly important in an attempted atmosphere piece like AH is trying to be. We have settled on a way of playing now which also helps - 2 players with 2 investigators each. This gives you more to do than when playing with more players with only 1 investigator each. Also we now limit play to the base game and one expansion (major or minor). More than that just complicated things too much and therefore broke the flow of the game, as well as taking up too much space and requiring too much set-up and take-down time.

10 out of 10 implies perfection and this game is far from it.  In fact it’s severely flawed – it’s complicated, cumbersome, has a long set up time, I frequently make mistakes in the rules and it’s game that very few other (normal) people want to play.  And yet……….it’s totally addictive and endlessly replayable and an enthralling immersive experience and perfect for solitaire play.

I wasn't impressed by this game. I realize it's an "experience" game but the experience was too long for me. After the first two hours I lose interest in what happens, after three hours I have to do sanity checks to stay awake and after four hours I'm lost in time and space.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A large game with so many raw elements (tokens, characters, monsters, equipment, spells, encounters) makes it easy to find interactions that confuse your understanding of the rules.

Once you have played it a few times, you learn things are actually very simple and following the turn sequence will answer nearly any question.

Even still, there is no elegance to these mechanics.  One's enjoyment of the game will be based upon how much they get out of the story.  I happen to love this theme and the byzantine gameplay actually adds to the atmosphere for me.

I do not get to play it nearly enough.

Great and challenging, we found 4-5 players is the best number for a good round. Also got Innsmouth Expansions which made it way more difficult.

RATING: 8
Fun both solo and with others.  However, this is not a game that you break out of the box and are playing within minutes after buying it.  The rules are easy enough to grasp once you start playing, but a read through the rules prior to play is very beneficial.  It's a lot of fun to work as a team in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quite a lot of rules to remember in the beginning. After few games it is much easier to control everything. There is not too much time to loose as every single missed opportunity comes back twice as hard. Looked as simple, friendly adventure, horror game - but it requires bit of planning - not mentioning luck and friendly dice :) and you need to have lots of them (dice). Definitely has a potential. Looking forward to play more games and to put expansions on the table.

A game of epic proportions, with tons of flavour text and millions(only a slight exaggeration)of pieces, scenarios and a strong theme. I just can't get my group to play it due to the long game time and complex rules. I've played it a few times solo and with one other player but everything is in great condition.

RATING: 7
Arkham Horror was one of my early favorites, and I played this quite a bit in my early days of the hobby. This was aided by the fact that my girlfriend liked it quite  a bit, and I still appreciate large parts of its design, but it has largely fallen by the wayside (and been traded) due to a cratering of my interest in cooperative games and the fact that my girlfriend does not want to really play board games anymore. I traded it away.

RATING: 5
Players charge around the town of Arkham, slaying beasties and closing the gates they are entering through.  A large and very lavish boardgame, in the spirit of Talisman.  Buckle on a character, wander around town, and see where the game takes you.  All players are cooperating and trying to defeat the game by keeping evil under control.  Lots of bits, lots of rules (not well laid out, considering the amount of time we had to go searching for specific items), lots of time and lots of squinting at the board (black text on purple, black text on brown, ... not a great idea!  Update - seen the reprint with a sepia type background - vastly easier on the eyes).  Some are going to love it, some will think it's too long and random.  I'm on the fence.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Keeps everyone involved at all times, which is a big reason to like it. However, there are a LOT of rules to keep track of, and the game is VERY fidgety. This detracts from my enjoyment and is the reason I am not usually willing to play it. Also it can be VERY long (4+ hours).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I kinda have to work myself up to play Arkham Horror, just because it takes a long time to set up, explain the rules to newbies, and then finally play. Though I always have a lot of fun when I finally do. But then I don't want to play it again for another month. I dunno.

Again, I love this game.  I think they did a good job scaling it to many players, though winning by closing the gates seems easier the more players you have.  I really believe the feel is captured pretty well, but it is a very "busy" game.  Lots of things to do and keep track of, and some confusion as to what might be a good move at times.  But still, the balance and feel of terror is fantastic.

Oozing with theme, high production quality and a great game to boot.  Often runs long - which builds the tension but this along with long set up and break down keeps it off the table until those special nights.

RATING: 3
A success in the tough RPG-style boardgames vein. A co-operative effort to defeat a fairly difficult automated game challenge. Features a host variables to keep the game fresh: a different Great Old One to defeat every game, a wide and unique selection of heroes, and a deeper pool of encounters at vaious locations. At heart it remains a "kill monsters and advance your guy" game, yet it is a evocative and well-polished one. The more recent Last Night on Earth is a quicker-and-dirtier version, btu this one is ggod for a more involved experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Had high hopes on it being a Lovecraft fan. Unfortunately, theme is all there is in it --and not much else.

The system pushes you under its wheels without allowing for any significant decisions to be made (unless drawing, reading and executing cards can be considered decisions). And 5 hours without any decision-making can be a very long time indeed...

Love the theme! Bought it last Christmas as a present - for myself. Played it a lot during the holiday and it felt like back in the day when Talisman was still good. Got all the expansions and will blindfoldedly buy all that are to come. It is a storytelling game anyhow so if you don't like those, stay clear.

I really enjoy Arkham Horror but it needs the Dunwich expansion to make the game really shine.  Probably too long and luck based for a lot of people but if I'm in the right mood then this is great.  I do so hate the tiny cards FFG uses though (and not just in this game) but I understand the reasoning.  This game takes up an insane amount of space as it is, our table wouldn't be able to handle it if it had playing card sized cards!

Once you get past the barrier to entry of the understanding the rules, it's an insanely fun game to get all your buddies together and play. Lots of fun and crazy adventures to be had. As a game it's kind of flawed because you have very little actual agency, often doing something very mundane can just result in an immediate and final death for your investigator, but I enjoy that since it fits the theme of Lovecraft very well. But that's a personal preference, the game is definitely not for everyone, especially not mechanically-orientated players or those who enjoy simple rules.

Traded to [user=mpin][/user] for [thing=29368][/thing].

Horror themed games are near & dear.  Cthulu mytos are no exception.  I bought this game with solo ventures in mind, and it did not disappoint.  I find that you need a place to 'save' this game since duration can get long.  I've played it solo (2 hrs.), 2-player (2.5 hrs), 3-player (4 hrs.) & 6-player (8 hrs.).  Dripping with theme & beautiful production, this was one of my favourite co-ops.  Unfortunately, it sat for over a year unplayed.  Even though I  managed to get set-up time down to under 15 min., the duration turns a lot of people off.

This game has a lot working against it--the rules are too complex, it takes too long to play, there are too many fiddly bits, it's too hard to store and manage all of the components, etc. On the other hand, it offers great atmosphere and theme. If you've got 2.5-3 hours to spare, this is a gem of a game. A great solo game, might I add.

Aki szereti a hangulatos játékokat, kiváló választás. A szerencse szerepe jelentős a kockadobások miatt, a játék előkészítése és elpakolása is időt vesz igénybe, a játék nagy helyigényű, ez negatívum. Az első játék alkalmával a játékidő elnyúlhat 4-5 óra fölé is, játékosszámtól függően, a játékszabály állandó böngészése miatt. Aki viszont szereti a szerepjátékos érzést, beleélni magát a játék világába, a negatívumok ellenére, remek szórakozásra lel.

Kipróbáltuk a családdal, egy 4 fős parti, 2 kisebb szünettel 6 órán keresztül zajlott, de észre sem vettük az idő múlását. A kooperatív jelleg nagyon jól működött, mindenki egyformán kivette a részét a játékból és együtt izgultunk minden egyes próbadobásnál. A játék nagyon hangulatos és szórakoztató, "Lots of Fun" mondaná az angol. Nekünk megfelelő kihívást jelentett ez a játék. A kellő mértékű pakli keverés ellenére az első három mítosz kártyán ugyanoda nyílt a kapu, így hamar ott találtuk magunkat, hogy Arkham utcáin mindenfelé szörnyek kóricáltak. A szabálykönyvet még sűrűn kellett lapozgatni, így is sikerült egy-két dolgot elhibázni. Nem túl felhasználó barát a szabálykönyv. A játék megérte a befektetést. (2013.10.31.)

Another one of "use to be" favorite games that are dropping on my list. 

I have always liked the solo play for this game and still do. It is also a co-operation game -- which is fun.

I seem to like dice games less and the setup can be long depending on the expansions you play. The game can be long with 6 or more players including several expansions. Also the rules need to be redone for new players and to show how all the differences in the expansions could be played.

This game is dripping with theme and the production value is outstanding. And the game? Fun, fun, fun. During our games, high-fives were common and we ARE all around our 40s! There are a lot of rules to digest at first but once you get going, it all comes into place nicely. The replay value is nothing short of amazing. And it plays very well solo with 1 or 2 characters. All in all, a very impressive game.

RATING: 6.22
One of the best cooperative games with great theme and tempo, deep in the Lovecraftian world of Arkham Horror. Every player has a character with special attributes and skills, who portray investigators and fighters against mysterious forces of evil and chaos or even Chthulhu himself!!
Character development is great, but there is never enough time to build it to the full potential because of constant spamming of monsters and portals that must be closed and sealed.
The biggest disadvantage is high dependency on luck which sometimes can cause a great imbalance between reword and punishment and punishments can be severe, but teamwork and coordination help a lot in the end.

One of my favourite games of all times.
However, in terms of "GAME"play, it has been surpassed by Eldritch Horror. 

I differentiate them thusly:
Arkham Horror is a fantastic experience with very immersive atmosphere, whereas Elritch Horror is the better game with encounters more fitting the overall story. In AH you explore, in EH you strategize.

RATING: 7
A lot better than I would have thought!  This is a fun game for a bunch of people.  Lots of cards will be added through expansions which will keep the game fresh.  Make SURE you download the errata from FFG.  Can be really fun and tense, or can be long and tedious.  Choose your players wisely.

RATING: 8.8
Yes, this is an exceptionally high rating for a game like Arkham Horror, but I am going to simply admit bias and have you move on if you disagree with it.

This is the game that got me into boardgames.  Not Catan, not Ticket to Ride, not Carcassonne, not Caylus, but this.  I played all of those before Arkham Horror, but was content not to start my own collection.  Why?  Narrative.

This is nowhere near to being the perfect game and it allows for an alpha gamer to completely dominate decisions - admittedly, it's a co-op game that requires either amazing co-ordination or a director to win, but when I play it, I don't tell anybody anything.  You are free to make your own choices because to me, what's really important about Arkham Horror and its many expansions are the stories it allows you to tell.  Even if you're not big on the Cthulhu Mythos (why the hell not?), the game provides a tremendous sense of adventure and thematic tension.

What AH did for me was show me that boardgames can actually provide cool experiences.  Euros are great and I like to play them, but in the end, most of them are all about optimization and points-gathering.  That's fine.  It's fun!  But what has always attracted me to games, especially video games, are the stories (though admittedly, you're not going to find any Oscar winners in video games).  Outside of that, if I was going to plunk myself down to play a game for hours, it was going to have strategy (Total War, for example).  

So here I was, minding my own business when a buddy busts out AH.  "You take a couple of dudes, I'll take a couple of dudes, and let's see if we can beat the boss. Here's some donuts to choose your stats."  Say what, now?  Boss?  A party system?  Stats?  Is this an RPG?  What happened after that blew my mind and I walked away with the thought, "Boardgames can do that???"

And here we are, some 200+ games later and $$$ poorer, but I tell you what - my life is hundreds of times richer.

RATING: 9
Arkham Horror is way too long a game for me. When we played, it seemed to have no ending in sight. It was  painful evening. Not at all the genre of game that I enjoy playing.

Arkham Horror is the same genre as in Betrayal at House on the Hill, but Arkham Horror is WAY longer. I prefer playing Betrayal at House on the Hill. House on the Hill plays rather fast.

Arkham Horror doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

I don't plan to play Arkham Horror any time soon. One painful experience was enough for me. Never again.




Update:



I did try Arkham Horror a second time. This time, with a different group of players. These players already knew the rules since they all played before. So, compared to the first time, rule wise it was a lot more smoother. I actually saw the end of the game too this time around. Although, we we no match for the creature at the end. So gaming experience overall was better than the first time. I'll have to think about the rating again. Not sure it's quite my type of game.

Rating goes from a 1 to a 4. Playing with the right players makes a difference. My first game ever was real torture.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy playing it. Rating up from a 4 to a 7.

Rating went up again from a 7 to a 9.

Got all 6 expansions at the same time for a very good price. Now will get basic game.

Just got basic game.

RATING: 8
One of my personal favs, largely because it is cooperative and sometimes the good guys don't win!

As a fan of the Cthulu mythos I found this very faithful to the source material...but not hardcore. After all, the point of the game is to have a great time with your friends.

Detractor: it takes 15 minutes to set up and, 3 hours later, 15 minutes to put away. Talk about a lot of parts! (we play with all the expansions...)

I don't exactly love AH. Several people in my game group do love it, and I play it with them because it works better with a five or six player group. (More than six just drags to death.) I find it to be fiddly, slow, and rather frustrating when you have a useless character. And there's something rather depressing about playing a game for three hours only to be devoured at the end.

Good.  Probably best "RPG in boardgame form" there is -- the fact that it's based on [i]Call of Cthulhu[/i] instead of [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] is not really relevant.

However, compared to CoC, it's longer, fiddlier, less thematic, less immersive, and really just not as fun.  Due to the complexity, it's harder to stay sharp on the rules, so unless you get it to the table all the time, it'll be a bit of a slog as you relearn everything.  So, why not just go play CoC?

A completely enveloping theme and excellent depth and character development makes AH a must have. Love Lovecraft's work and love the Cthulhu Mythos. The stories that can unfold during a game are unmatched and really bring this game to life in your memory for a long time afterwards. Only downside is the length of time to set up the game, play it, and tear it down. It can be VERY long, and you really need to set aside a healthy chunk of time in order to play a game of it. It can also take up a lot of table space, especially when used with an expansion.

If it wasn't for the uninspiring Cthulu theme, would people actually like this game? The bottom line here is this game is BORING, and not just boring for a little bit, but boring for several hours.  I mean, one way to win basically involves players doing nothing for three turns in a row, SEVERAL TIMES during the game.  The boring-ness of the game is reason enough to avoid it completely, and that's without mentioning the dull theme, the excessive dice rolling, the absence of tough choices, the hour long set up time, the repetitivenes, and the overly complicated and detailed rules. But still, this game seems to get an absurd amount of blind love from Cthulu fans who enjoy watching paint dry.

It's really my kind of game.  I always enjoy a good adventure game.  I played it with 6 people though, and it never really seemed like we were in all that bad of shape.  With six people acting between every big bad thing (gate opening), it was pretty easy to keep the terror level in check.  On the other hand, clue tokens were spread thin so not many gates were sealed; we won by defeating the old one upon his arrival.  It would probably be more tense with only 3-5 players, and I would like to try it that way.

Great cooperative game, very exciting for those who love Lovecraft novels. You might do something quite long and exhausting, because defeating the primal is not usually an easy task.

The system is probably easily tweakable to make more difficult, but I'd rather have seen this have been done by FFG.  I'd look forward to some offical "patch" or expansion that would help make the game harder, but right now it doesn't provide enough tension to play more than once or twice a year with the right group of ex-rpgers.

About time I updated my comment of AH, because since the first time I have played a few more times and it is now one of my favorite games. I even have most of the expansions. The story telling this game provides, the flavor and the theme it features are second to none. Granted, takes some time to play, but every time it hits the table we all have a blast. At first I thought Eldritch Horror improved this experience, but nothing beats the claustrophobic feel of walking the Arkham streets. A solid 10.

UPDATE: Knocking this down to an 8. Still love it, but I feel that succeeding games (Eldritch Horror, AH: TCG, Mansions of Madness 2nd Ed) have shown themselves to be great alternatives.

UPDATE: AH is still one of our favorite "event games" as well as our favorite FFG franchise. We have all the expansions and enjoy the variety. I seem to be alone in our group because I think the endgame versus the Ancient One is kind of anticlimactic and boring but I still love to play this game.

Rapidly becoming one of our favorite games. Yes, there are a lot of rules but there are some EXCELLENT game aids here on BGG and they make everything easier to handle. I like that there's always something to so (fight monsters, look for stuff, close gates) and it always feels tense. Role-playing fun in a boardgame package. HIGHLY recommended.

Can be really tense and fun, though.

It's cooperative and for me and filled the niche that used to be occupied by playing Pen&Paper RPG's.  There's no role playing, but there's numerous characters to use which you can customize stats, equipment and go around town whacking monsters.  What bothers me is the excessive space it takes up, 2 - 5 hours game time plus the setup/packing up time involved with playing the game.  I like it, but can only play sporadically.  

Be sure to play this like Tales of the Arabian Nights: Have the player to your left read out your encounter card.  If there is a choice, only read out that choice and not the results of the choice until after they choose.  If they don't choose to do a skill check, don't tell them what would have happened.  If a person fails a beneficial skill check (ie nothing happens), don't tell them what would have happened if they had passed.  If a person passes a negative skill check (ie nothing happens), don't tell them what would have happened if they failed.

I didn't care much about the old "Arkham Horror", even though I own it and it is super rare. The new version does everything right - more choices for the investigators and less randomness, but keeping the constant level of threat. The amount of cards and variety in this game is nearly staggering, and it was a good idea to tone down the more humorous approach of the first game. One thing that could be improved though is the dark board that makes it very difficult to see where monsters are - moving monsters in the Mythos phase is a drag, especially if Arkham is overrun. But all in all an excellent new effort by the ever improving Fantasy Flight.

RATING: 7
A great Lovecraft universe game that is a bit heavy and overwhelming at times especially when you are playing with less than 3-4 players.  You can solo, but it is EXTREMELY difficult to win in my opinion.  If you have a few hours open and a group of friends who enjoy the universe or horror games in general, this is definitely one to play.

RATING: 7
I played Arkham and loved it. A big 6 player game where we just won. 

So the second game, with my partner, was to see if she liked it and whether I should buy it. It was okay, but it seemed to lack repeatability. Going through gates takes ages and you want Elder signs, how the gates and monsters pan out meaning you can't always do what you want, but sometimes you're screwed and can do nothing but wait for something to happen. 

Good to play, but I don't need a copy myself. I'm told each game/expansion is good for about 10 plays.

Edit: Played a lot more, seems a game where it plays you as much as you play it, but fun to bring out every so often.

Fantasy Flight Games does beutiful work. Tons of bits, cards, and great artwork... but the game IS tedious with a constant need to draw and act out cards FOR EVERYTHING. This is only for die-hard Cthulhu fans, which I am not. Reminds me a lot of the old pick-your-own-adventure books.

I enjoy the artwork and theme. The combo of RPG elements in a board game. It takes quite a bit of time to setup and the rules are complicated (very RPG like with Horror Check rolls and Sneak rolls). Also - the game is very hard to beat - especially if you wake the Great Old One. I also played solitare and found 3 characters too unwieldy. Best to stick with 2 characters if you play solo. Also - expect to lose 9 out of 10 times. 
If you like this theme - the same characters and artwork can be found in the much lighter Elder Sign by the same company. Elder Sign was ported to iOS and Android -  give it a spin and then get that board game too.

Played a couple of times now.  One with and one without variants.  I think SOME variants would be good, cause it was too hard with and too easy without.  A LOT of setup and fiddly rules.  One of those games that REQUIRES massive player aid help and rule checking for the first several games. Downgraded to 6 because of this.

This is an "experience" game -- one that you play for the experience of playing.  It's got a bit of a learning curve (but not too bad), takes a long time but it IS fun.  Sort of like a horror themed Talisman with more decision making and freedom of movement.

Fun and thematic if you're in the right mood, but it can become an unwieldy dicefest if you don't take steps to keep the game moving along. Very prone to the cooperative game syndrome of one or two players dictating the way the whole table plays.

This game surprised me. It grabbed me and pulled me in...

An odd game category, but one that fills a nice spot for me. This is basically an RPG with no game master. The game is the GM.
No real strategy, just going around modifying stats, getting stuff, and stopping the bad guys. If you play the same scenarios all the time, it will get old, but that's what the expansions are for.

RATING: 6.6
Rating 6,2:
Purchased exactly for solo 1 player/investigator. 
Good game and atmosphere but some rules are flawed: 3/8 Ancient Ones are too easy and can be gamed; you have penalizing terror checks for spawn but not for the big Ones; rumors and other events are not scalable; one investigator, Mandy, can win the game by herself; quite a few poorly explained procedures, particularly in cards' text. Wholly strange for a mature game with a huge follow up and one major reprint.
It is not clear wether the game is really supported for 1 investigator.
I use D&D pre-paints for extra fun and because that helps me keep track of monster numbers in Arkham.

Rating 7,8: Great replayability; after all you can win with a single investigator, but not with every one.
Rumors can kill the game.
Discarding flawed Ancient Ones; enjoy the challenge of an hard game, not one I can predictably win.

Rating 6,9: can consistently be played under 1h with a single investigator, yet satisfactory play would require house rules.
Far too easy with 2 investigators or more.
When the rules are mastered the basic game feels just like a stub, heavily dependent on expansions.
This would indeed be an 8-9 game with proper fixes. 
AH is a stub that requires expansion components to become a complete game.

Rating based on about 100 games w/ 1 investigator and 8 w/ 2 investigators: 6.6. Sold game and all plastic minis.

Good game with strong theme and storytelling elements.  Overall the game is a solid experience with great components and a ton of expansions to support it.  Rates lower on my scale due to overly complicated and convoluted rules with some of the game mechanics involving combat and monster movement. 

Borrowed this from a friend for the better part of a year and played it a whole lot.  Would not purchase this for myself.  I am however considering picking up Eldritch Horror at some point.

I love everything about this game.
The game is hard to understand if you play it for the first time. But don't let that scare you away. Once you are familiar with the rules it is a great game. 
The game is hard enough without expansions, specially the ones where they add an extra board. If yu have played the game multiple times and know the cards it is fun to buy an expansion with new cards. 
If you are looking for an evening filling game with horror and coop, Arkham horror is highly recomended.

I love the H.P. Lovecraft universe, and this game very much fits the mold.

RATING: 6
I really like the Cthulhu theme, but for most of the game there really wasn't any tension.  We handled 90% of the game without any real threat of losing, until we failed to realize the importance of one particular card and didn't fulfill the actions required to eliminate it.  If we'd been more experienced we would have sailed through the game.  I also think this is a game that needs some player elimination, as I don't think a little time in a hospital or sanitarium would 'fix you up right' in Lovecraft's world.  However, we played it with a large group.  I'd love to try it again with the BGG recommended group size.

Está bien pero a mi parecer le falla una cosa: la mayoría de las veces ganan los malos.
Es un juego cooperativo donde siempre (o casi) nos gana el tablero.
Colabora con tus compañeros, procura estar bendecido y tener muchas pistas. Si tienes pocas pistas y estás "maldito" no podrás ayudar nada para la lucha final.
Es un juego complicado, donde además debes saber algo de inglés, es original y además puedes jugar tú solo contra el tablero.
PARTIDAS
13/04/2008 4 jugadores (Tyrion, Juas, Pi y Gato)Nos toca contra Yog-Sugot (o algo así, que es un bicho de cuidado, creo que el segundo más chungo después de "Tulú"), cogemos los personajes al azar; estuvimos con el tablero casi todo el tiempo controlado, pocos mostruos y pocas puertas abiertas y cerramos las 2 primeras con "Elder Sign"; al cerrar rápidamente las primeras puertas no salieron muchas más y cada monstruo que salía temblaba imaginándose lo que le iba a venir. Aunque todo iba bastante bien los 4 fuimos devorados y cogimos nuevos personajes; al final no terminamos la partida porque se nos hizo muy tarde, pero ya teníamos 5 ó 6 puertas cerradas y los más probable es que ni siquiera llegara a despertarse el "Bicharraco".
20-04-2008 4 jugadores(Pi, Tyrion, Juas y Gato): nos toca contra Husler y nosotros vamos con el Mago, el de la Guitarra, la Científica y la Monja. Durante la partida los monstruos están muy controlados y las puertas tambien pero en 2 fases de Mythos nos meten 2 contadores extras del Monstruo Final. con lo cual acaba por despertarse el Monstruo y a pesar de que es facil atacarlo a falta de 2 Token nos devora a todos a pesar de que yo había sacrificado 2 aliados para ir ganando tiempo. Una pena!!! El próximo día lo ganamos fijo.

Tremendously slow due to clunky mechanics rather than AP. Nonetheless, fantastic theme and nice co-op experience. Would imagine to be very good for playing with non-gamers who have time to spare.

Rating based off of 1 three player game.  Has a rediculously long setup and learning curve.  Its also extremely difficult to win but thats good for a co-op game.  The theme is great as is the art--I did enjoy my play of this--though it came down to a single dice roll to win.  Which is kinda dis-heartening for such a long game.  I don't always like dice roll-heavy games but this was generally ok because it is against the board rather than other players.  I'd play again.

[b][thread=479050]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Arkham Horror"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]1+[/b] plays) A highly-thematic co-op. Great components and evocative event cards help immerse players in H.P. Lovecraft's universe, but unnecessarily complex rules and a monumental playing time make it forbiddingly unwieldy. Not being a Lovecraft fan, I would prefer to play other co-ops, as this one  invariably feels like its takes more time than its worth.

It's not a bad game, but I really, really dislike playing it.

It's waaay too long for my taste. It's also really fiddly because there are tons of pieces and tokens to sift through, which unecessarily lenghtens the playtime. 

It's also too random. If you're unlucky you will spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing at all while waiting for your turn to come around.

Great theme but I wish the board was just a bit more map-like.  Always wish there was some way to reduce some of the clutter - there are a TON of bits/cards/etc.
EDIT: I now use the iOS app to take care of all the card decks because the reshuffling every time is a pain in the ass.  Game is awesome as ever but FFG's rule book is pretty much crap.  Get the Universal Head rules summary - he does a much better job.

If you like the Cthullu   Mythos..you should get this game.  Very well done and makes for a good CoOp game.  But the difficulty really depends on which of the old ones you get.

Looks like a reputable cooperative game, love to try it some time.  Unfortunate title, really gives it the wrong connotations IMHO.  Played it twice, the first time from 10pm-3:30am, and it was one of the most epic and fun game sessions ever!  Second game was four player and also fun.  Somewhat like Pandemic on steroids, and tougher too!  Great components, very well themed, works very well as a cooperative game, and very very fun!  Perfect for burning the midnight oil on a guys nite out!  Some of the thematic aspects may make it unsuitable for a family context, which is the only reason I (and my wife) would be hesitant about buying it, and the fact that there's a lot of details in the rules.
A friend recommends A Touch of Evil as a simpler and better game to get, similar feel but less complexity.

My first experience with this game was abysmal. It was a 6-player game and was so easy that by the end we were literally begging for new portals to open just so we could finish it off.

On the flip side, it has beautiful components and a great theme (or would have, if there had been a real threat to us).

It’s impossible to comment on this game now without comparing it to Eldritch Horror. My original comment for this game called it "a long drive for such a short journey."  That is, the overhead of rules and component set up outweighed the fun delivered. I found it too long and too complex for such a light gaming experience. It was more tedium than terror.

Then EH comes along and hits the note just right for me. It pulls off the thematic, Ameritrashy, lots-of-dice-rolling game in [blogpost=27416]a genre that’s a favorite of mine [/blogpost] in a way that feels commensurate to the experience. They streamlined the overhead but left the experience. 

From what I see, some people prefer the added rules chrome of AH, and some of us prefer the streamlining of EH. Rather than argue over which is best, fans of Lovecraft should marvel that we have these choices. Fans of other genres envy how many Cthulhu games there are. Their genres live in shacks while we have mansions (of madness!).

A game I would very much like to play more often, not least because of an interest in Lovecraft and a long dalliance with Call of Cthulhu.

Update: We've prioritised Arkham Horror for 2 player play in 2015, hoping to work through all of the Elder Gods. Three games thus far.

this game should be a favorite based on theme and design, but somehow I can't get a grasp on the fun. Everytime we play this fails to excite. We replayed several times thinking we were missing something. In the end we won't be playing this in the near future.

Tried this. Not sure if it was because it requires lots of people to really enjoy or that we just didn't get it...but we found this a bit too difficult & tedious to get in to. Love the theme. Love the artwork. I've heard Eldritch Horror is a better reboot.

I've only played this solo ... twice. After extremely long sessions (8+ hours each) I abandoned both. I really, really, really, really wanted to like this game as I love the theme ... but its so fiddly. The footprint is huge, the number of things to keep track of (environment effects, elder god effects, rumor effects, etc, etc) is soul crushing (hey, that's probably part of the theme), and the difficulty can be pretty brutal. I'll keep it and trot it out every 8-12 months and try it again, maybe the moons will align and provide me the experience that the real fans have managed to find. Until then, I'll just play Elder Sign.

RATING: 7
Great lovecraftian feel, but strange how this simple a game lacks stream play due to the many exceptions in the rules or specific rules. Takes too long to play, and I often get the feeling that I don´t get anywhere in the game (especially with injured or near insane characters). And if I feel that with a game of this kind, something´s wrong with a game.

More a surreal, pulpy romp than a Lovecraft story. The game laughs at you with its otherworldly chaos, and as the cogs of cosmic horror turn, you lose the game screaming and laughing at yourself. 

My set-collection variant that also emphasizes Arkham encounters and gets rid of other world encounters:

I'm a big fan of H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos, so I enjoy this game even though it gets a bit repetitive at times. It works very well played solo and offers multiple ways to handicap the game, if needed. Hopefully, the expensions add a little more balance to the game and limit some of the repitition.

RATING: 7
I've played this a few times now and have mixed but positive feelings about the game.  Arkham Horror has a lot of mechanic, some of which is pretty clunky.  You have to grok skill adjustment, monster density, and a lot of odds and ends to fully appreciate the game.  It's not for casual gamers and will turn off even semi-serious boardgamers, but it has appeal for pen-and-paper RPG players who are jonesing for good horror content. 

But against the harder Great Old Ones with three players, it can be a nailbiter once you've got it down.  I'm looking forward to some serious games of Arkham Horror over the next few years.

This is seems to be one of those 'love it or hate it' games.  maybe I've just been playing with too large of a group as well as a group with too diverse of a experience level (i'm a newbie and played with several people that this is their lifestyle game).  In general every time I play this game, it feels more like the game is playing me rather than the other way around.  Couldn't really get into the story telling element (but maybe mostly due to size of group).

After a lousy first play (my cousin and I didn't have all the rules straight and if you don't remember the whole town monster limit/outskirts rule things get out of hand fast), I let this game sit on my shelf for a couple years. Recently, my girlfriend suggested I re-read the rules and we've since played two highly enjoyable sessions. Thank Heavens for girlfriends who want to try games that have been sitting dormant on the shelf forever.

Because of this, I have upgraded my rating from a 7 to an 8. I'd go higher if play time wasn't 15 hours (that includes set up, play, tear down, going insane.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I find this a very enjoyable cooperative game.  After a few plays, you can get a feel for the way the base game plays and (at least in my experience) that gives you an advantage to win more often than not.  This is especially true when all the players are highly cooperative and plan/strategize each other's options.

Bad luck can always make the game harder, even if you have some of the better investigators in the game.

If you keep play moving, especially during the upkeep phase when players tend to try to plan out their turn's activities so as to adjust their skills optimally, it can be a 2-1/2 hour game (and a victory).  With snack breaks, explaining rules to new players, or over-analytical players, a 3-1/2 or longer session should be expected.

The dice rolling mechanics allow for luck to help you in a fight you should really lose, or force you to spend valuable clue tokens for rerolls on fights you should win.  The right combinations of items can nearly seal a victory, though it's always a gamble to go hunting for them with gates opening up and monsters terrorizing the town.

The game ambience is fantastic.  I find that I really enjoy imagining I'm my investigator experiencing these events in the 1920's.  This is definately my current 'favorite game'.

A pesar de ser un buen juego, es demasiado lento para mi gusto. El problema no es la duración del juego, sino que los turnos demoran mucho, por la cantidad de cartas y textos existentes. La preparación también es demasiado compleja. Quizás jugando con varias personas experimentadas esto cambie. Entretenido jugarlo, pero sólo de vez en cuando, y con paciencia.

Arkham Horror: pulp-mode Lovecraft + zero psychological horror.

Love the atmosphere, absolutely love the little details and touches given to Arkham Horror especially in some of the expansions.  We play with our own house rules to create a more character driven experience which puts the game into a realm of its own.

Score lowered due to its time commitment, lack of being able to find people to play with (not really the games fault but as a heavy, co-op it can be a bit hard)  and the general "randomness" of the game (sometimes despite how well you played, you're just dead).

Based on 25 plays:
+ The components are gorgeous (superb illustrations).
+ For almost any number of players.
+ Optimal package size for the base game.
+ Good gameplay, if a bit clunky.
+ Tension at its best. "Now that I have the money to buy items, I don't have the time."
- The rulebook is a bit messy.
- The board is overly large.
- Many components get lost to the graphic mess.
- The beginning of the game dictates the tension of the endgame. If investigators do well in the beginning, there will be little tension.
- After 25 plays I don't quite feel the tension like I did before. Need to find out why.

This is my 2nd favourite game of all time ---- next to Duel of Ages 2. I own all of the expansions plus the lovely Investigator miniatures. Also, I've copied a ton of custom stuff from other very creative minds. I play only solitaire with 4 Investigators every time. I have an entire room dedicated only to Arkham Horror & will undoubtedly play this game the rest of my life. I keep stats on each Investigator & Ancient One & roll randomly each game. I don't believe this game will ever get stale because of the rich Universe that has been created for this innovative boardgame.

Fun co-op game, especially if you like the Cthulhu Mythos.  Feels more to me like a role-playing board game (with skill checks and heavily story/flavor-based gameplay) which is usually a turn-off for me in board games (I like RPGs, but I like to keep my RPGs and board games separate).  However, for some reason, I still like this game.  Could be my bias towards Lovecraftian stuff, though.

Can be pretty long though; I don't feel like playing this often because I usually don't want to block off a whole afternoon (and possibly evening) to play it.  Still, it makes it to the table occasionally.

It's really long, it feels a little bit like math class, and it starts out slow, but the tension starts to build in those last few turns while everything goes to shit and all of a sudden, you're like, "Oh my god I was just devoured by Yog-Sothoth," and you realize that the last five hours were completely awesome.

Edit: With the proliferation of awesome coop games, I can't really justify getting this played.  It's simply too long, and too uneven, for what you get. It's not a bad game by any means, just one that I won't often choose to play.

  I personaly really love this game, but I wish it was more of a hit in my circle of friend.

  I played several time alone, once or twice with 2 player and once with my group of friend. 

  We played with 6 people, which I do not recommend unless it is with experienced gamer that do not take too much time doing their turn. (about 2 person in the group planned their turn ahead, the rest took an eternity to choose what they should do.)

  Where I find this game challenging and love the mechnanics, they find it very long and 'spent a lot of time doing nothing'. We spent over 6 hour on the game, furtunally it resulted in a win. 

  On the positive side 
    -The art work is beatifull specially if you are into horror/lovecraft. 
    -There are a lot of components and they are well made.   
    -The theme is awesome and very present thru the whole game. 
    -The mechanic is interesting and challenging. 
    -There is a tons of replayability, and a tons of expension. 
    -You can play alone and still make it fun.  

  On the negative side 
    -There is a lots of component and cards, Which can get very annoying when playing with a 5+ people. 
    - It needs a big suface to play on.
    -The sliders keep moving which may cause you to cheat even though you do not mean to. 
    -It is not a 'ungamer friendly' game
    -Hard to predict how much time it will take to play, it may take 20 min or 6 hours... 

I give the game a 9

Best if you are already steeped in the Lovecraft ambience of dread and despair.  During my last session we kept saying "I can't believe we've survived this long."  Our bodies were slumped in our chairs, our voices were a dull monotone, our eyes were glazed and our minds were numb.  It was a great experience.  --Oh, and of course we lost.  Which means we all were driven insane and then devoured by the Great Old One who had stepped through an interdimensional portal onto the streets of Arkham.  Wanna play?

[u]The Good[/u]: 1) Lets you be part of a story where 1920's earth is on the brink of utter Lovecraftian annihilation. 2) Has a ton of quality expansions, and further fan-made stuffs, that give it serious replayability. The bloat is real, but can be mitigated with smart use of the cards, and lend to giving each play its own unique feel. 3) One game of this can fill an entire day -- and still be entertaining going into the final stretch.

[u]The Bad[/u]: 1) Rules are layered and messy. The UniversalHead player aid is essential. 2) Footprint of this game is staggering. Forget a table, it will take over your entire [i]room[/i]. 3) Decision-making takes a back seat to the narrative.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: An enormous, sprawling, story-telling Ameritrash. Awkward in places, but quite fun if you enjoy the narrative of a game as much as its mechanics.

This game was my first taste of Lovecraftian mythos and I loved it.

Unfortunately the game itself does tend to lend itself to a few experienced players telling newer players "go here", "do this" etc. etc.

I like not knowing what a monster is until I go to try and hit/sneak past it. I like being afraid of everything and so I should be. Lovecraft's 'monsters' were written to be scary and dangerous. I think it really adds a level to the game that can be lost on experienced players.

The first game I bought for hard, big cash in my Boardgaming resurgence and wanted to like it more than I do. 

The theme is good and there is a plethora of events and items and monsters and stuff.
But the game is to amerithrashy for my taste. To much rolling dice to see if you make it and also to fiddly with a few to many moving parts.

Well, I learned something at least :D

This game can be a major time (and sanity) commitment, especially with larger crowds, but the amount of things that can happen, and that players can do, is pretty astonishing.  Even without the plethora of expansions, the ways each game plays out will be incredibly diverse, given the amount of characters, monsters, Ancient Ones, locations to visit, various items to collects, and events to survive.  While it often comes down more luck of the dice rolls and card draws, than to successful team or individual planning, when you do pull something off, it feels really good, and is the sort of game where there is a real sense of teamwork and camaraderie involved, even if all participants know it will probably be for naught.

While the theme is fantastic, it certainly is more based on a simplified take on the Cthulhu Mythos, than the actual writings of Lovecraft.  That aside, the game does have the ability to make it seem like some unspeakable evil is actively thwarting your efforts, and the text for the events is fantastic, though only seven event cards for each location seems a bit low for the base set.  Cannot wait to get some more games in and inevitably expand it.

Played 1 time with 5 players. This was one of the wierdest gaming experiences I have ever had. It started out with great anticipation, having read so many good reviews. Then as I learned the game, I was blown away by the cool mechanics. Then I started to realize how cool this game must be if you know the Lovecraft mythos. Then I realized there were a couple mechanics I hated in this game like characters with equipment cards and hit points etc. And then the moer the other guys raved about the theme and made story references, the more annoying I found it to not understand anything about the stories which made me feel like I was missing out on an important poart of the game. Then I started to get a headache and realized I had a lot of reading to do for this week, so I left my character convalescing in the hospital and went home. Weird game experience. I rate it a 9 AND a 4, so we'll give it a 5 because it ended at 4.

Playing solo is a bit tiring and lonely, but it works quite well, which says a lot for the design.  The art and bit quality are both excellent.  It does have a pretty big board with a ton of decks to lay out around it.  I could do without shuffling so many tiny cards, but that's a problem with a lot of games.  Anyway, it's a very good game with a great theme and high production values.

I am really glad I got to play this classic, but I doubt I'll ever play it again.  So much time reading.  I know a lot of this text (& text in other games) is supposed to be humorous and add to the fun of the game.  While others are laughing I'm thinking, "Let's get on with it. I want to play."

The game is very fine quality, and I was especially impressed with the heavy cards.  If I liked the game at all, I would buy it because FF makes such quality games.

A definite hit when we are in the mood for a longer game (1.5 hours +), it unfortunately doesn't get played as much as it should because there are so many "quicker" options (Peurto Rico, Small World, Carcassonne, etc, etc) in the group that get brought to a games night.

It's fidgetty, a lot of time is spent in tedious shuffling, it is long.  Yes but I enjoy playing this game regardless.  It has wonderful atmosphere, the bits are beautiful and the slow progress makes the story unfold much like Lovecraft's books, lots of words and uselessly long sentences but dark and intriguing.  I like the fact I can play solitaire and that it is a challenge.  I'm anxious to try it with more players but I can understand that the charm may not work equally well on everyone.

I've been playing this game for years. Even if you don't like horror movies or books, this is still a fun game. It does have a pretty high learning curve and many tiny rules to pay attention to. Eventually we got to where we decided to ignore some of the really tricky monster rules that weren't adding anything to the game, as a house rule. This game often works best if you have at least 1 player who really knows the game well to sort of act as a game master as they play the game, to keep things on track.

Great looking game.  Seemed a little tedious during play.  Game does a good job creating a sense of foreboding.  Co-operative play; can be played solo - in fact I enjoy solo play of Arkham Horror quite a bit.

My only complaint about this game is about the amount of effort it seems to take for me to keep the rules straight.

RATING: 9
When I'm in the mood for Arkham Horror, absolutely nothing else will scratch the itch.  Whether the game ends in victory or spectacular failure, this is always a great time. 

Typically, we play with one big box expansion and one small box expansion at a time. We're kind of in the process of finding what we like and what we don't, on the way to building our own Arkham Horror "kit". As such, plays are usually recorded under whichever big box expansion we play with. For those occasions where we do play "kitchen sink" style (multiple expansion boards, etc.), those plays are recorded under the base game. My "10" rating is for the Arkham Horror system as a whole, and not necessarily for the base game on its own.

My regular Battlestar Galactica play-by-forum group took a crack at playing AH PBF for a little while. Here are links to the games we played:

Pros
-Lots of variety out of the box
-Collecting items is fun
-Large game board and decent amount of components
-Well supported, lots of expansions (may slow down with Eldritch Horror now out)

Cons
-Game plays you - you basically go to places with a 50/50 chance that something good or bad will happen to you
-Lots of miss your turn (e.g. while trying to close gates, you basically miss two turns and just resolve random card effects, no decision making)
-Reverse tension game. Game starts off intense with lots of things happening. As you progress, the game gets easier and easier
-Having the Great Old One awaken often did not feel like a big deal as killing them didn't seem difficult (even when you weren't preparing for it). This was fixed in the expansion however as they made the fight more interesting and difficult
-Sealing gates (the primary game objective) can be made completely pointless if you don't finish it in time as you are not rewarded for almost succeeding, the boss will be the same difficulty regardless of how many gates you seal (with some exceptions)
-Depending on boss you choose, can have very long play time (4+ hours)
-LOTS of book keeping between turns, often with no player aid on the game board itself - e.g. what is the limit of monsters in the city (depends on the # of players), limit of monsters in outskirts (depends on # of players differently than prev.), how many gates are there (depends on # of players again differently), which monsters move and in which direction, what gate opens, where does a clue spawn, what prior environment or rumour effects are there, what great old one effect is there?
-Game is not well balanced (some locations have more gates than other for no reason; some specific locations counter intuitively have events with more good than bad outcomes or vice versa)
-Game breaks theme (you can have a nun with two guns riding on a motor cycle shooting at monsters)
-Need large table for game board

RATING: 7
I love Lovecraft, and this is the great granddaddy of monster-smashing co-ops. I've played A Touch of Evil and Middle-Earth Quest, both heavily influenced by this game.

However, I'm still on the fence. The game wasn't as fiddly as I feared, but did require several rules lookups for stuff that wasn't really important.

I like:
* choices on the encounter cards (MEQ and ATOE don't have them)
* Sanity (thematic)
* slider-bars (they add some choice)
* variety of Great Old Ones and characters

I dislike:
* very powerful and arbitrary effects
* prevalence of combat (unthematic)

Tough as nails. Some games I've brutally lost within a few rounds, others have lasted all night. The close victories and barely losses are always so intense!

Unlike Descent Arkham Horror has not grown on me as much.  It's cooperative so you're trying to beat the game more than each other.  To me it just doesn't provide the same satisfaction of beating someone.  You're not playing a clever manipulator, but a stack of cards and chance.  Ehh, I'll play it, but I won't recommend it.

First play was insanely hard. This game takes some abstract thinking occasionally. You would think closing portals would be useful, but in some cases it's better to leave them open. The most recent play involved me getting lost in space and time more than playing the game. Some reorganization definitely improves the playability of the game and makes it less frustrating to play.

I really can't get into most co-op. Arkham is too long, too big, and is too much about a hive-mind (more often than not controlled by one person who has slightly more experience) going through the motions. The one saving grace is that the art and writing are well done and the atmosphere can be immersive with the right group. If all the stars align it turns into a pretty amusing role playing game, but that doesn't have anything to do with the actual game.

I love Lovecraft's works and the game production is excellent, but the whole set-up and rule learning things are a bit too much for a first-timer. Flow charts posted here help a lot. And the game machanism is really boring when you doesn't put some role-playing elements in it.  I believe a BM is needed to raise other players' interests for the first time, especially when others are not used to play RPGs and have no idea about Lovecraft).

PS. (1)It's hard to find gamers to play it in a fast-paced city. (2)I prefer the money pieces in the old version. They seem more like a real stuff and easier to handle ;p

A játék eleve elég szar (rendkívül vontatott és teljesen véletlenszerű), de a magyar kiadás borzalmas, fordítási és nyomtatási hibákkal, a szabályokban a kereszthivatkozások véletlenül sem a helyes oldalra irányítanak, a tipikus balkáni igénytelenség teteje. Ebből és az Descent hasonlóan pocsék magyar változatából megtanultam, hogy a magyar kiadásokat kerüljem el messziről. Inkább megveszem a német vagy angol változatot esetleg kicsit drágábban, mint hogy az ilyeneket támogassam.

As much as I actually like this game, I've best heard it described as way too long, lots of fiddly rules, many times you will get things wrong and not know it, the rulebook is hard to figure out (googling is quicker for a rules clarification), and easy to lose at, but still an awesome game.

Definitely not for everyone, and I might be rapidly approaching that group.

A cooperative game that could turn into a "single player decides for everybody", the only thing that keeps it from that is the sheer complexity of the game.

If I want to have a rich thematic experience this is my goto game. Its true that setup takes a while but proper organisation of all the cards will speed this up a bit. I love the feeling of dread and impending doom you have in this game as you try to beat the odds by trying to take down the ancient one. I get attached to my investigators as we try to battle on with dwindling sanity and stamina. The only thing I don't really like in this game compared to Eldritch is combat, which I feel is more elegant in Eldritch.

I have all the expansions for this game. I has great variability.

Arkham Horror is specially indicated for those who enjoy the adventure more than the mechanic aspects of a game (in fact, this one is decided by luck much more than for other aspects).
In my opinion, an appropiated atmosphere may be created in order to enjoy this kind of game (to play with the indicated gamers and in the precise moment are essential aspects, for example). AH could be especially boring if you aren’t the kind of person that would enjoy time imaging a story full of supernatural situations.
I love Lovecraft’s works, so this game is good for me, but not as good as the geek rating says. 
One last commentary: components are very good designed and have a pretty appearance!

Of course, when it slows way down due to checking the rules and/or new players and/or horrible dice rolling, this game can be really painful.

RATING: 10
Great game, loads of re-playability and whilst I understand folks saying it can be too complex to be easily accessible I've found one person "knowing" it around the table can happily lead the others through a session.
The stories that unravel are a joy to behold, dark and gritty and the game always makes it feel that odds are against you and disaster is imminent.  Which is exactly what I want from a game.  Victory feels earned and every success is a result of strategy and skill.  In a co-operative game like this it draws the players together into a tight unit. 
Admittedly I am biased and have all the expansions, but with time to plan out and working with my friends to set a game that everyone will get something out off (assigned investigators that appeal to them, a particular boss and/or herald etc).

The theme leaves me cold and there are a few things I would have liked better from functional point of view. It is a good game though, it scales fine to different number of players and seeing that you only use a small fraction of the components I imagine the replayability is quite high. Nightmarish rules, it's one of the few games I always play with the rulebook in hand and every time I discover that I'm doing something wrong.

This game needs second edition with steamlined rules.. oh wait, we got it already. It´s called Eldritch Horror. Eldritch horror has less complicated rules and lesser number of "deaf passages".

A gift from Secret Santa 2011. 

It took me a long time to play this game, but what a game it is! In one word I would describe this game as immens. The mechanics work great together and as you play the game the story of your characters unfolds itself before your eyes.

The main problem with this game is the setup (too long for a solo play) and the game length.

RATING: 7
My one-time favorite cooperative game! I love: the number of playable characters, the number of actions available to them at any time, and the fact that this complex game leaves you room to do anything you want at the beginning. You can hang out at Hibb's Roadhouse and try to get that ally card if you want, or you can go to the administration building and get another skill. You aren't immediately forced into a hyper-competitive state where a single misstep could spell doom for your team. Rampaging through the streets to slay monsters is very fun too.

The rulebook is terrible. It takes several plays to fully understand the rules given the rulebook. Read the FAQS well. 

I bought this game within a year or two of when it was first released. In 2015 I think I'm ready to sell it now. It's very complex to teach, and compared to a lot of other really complicated games the payoff isn't that great. It's pretty engaging, but very procedural, so playing with a group can feel like very halting as you repeat the cycle of a player turn over and over. Combat is pretty dice heavy and fair for a Lovecraftian universe too. All the things I said I really like about the game above aren't really true anymore compared to other games I've played. 

In terms of story, I've read that this game is outdone in the Lovecraft universe by Elder Sign. In terms of payoff for teaching and complexity, considering it takes a game or two to get used to it, it's totally outdone by more recent games like Archipelago, Nations, and Chaos in the Old World. For a cooperative game, Sentinels of the Multiverse is better because of how the mechanics integrate into the theme (and it's also easier to teach). 

Sold in 2016. It's fine to play if you have someone to DM it, but it's outclassed by other games nowadays.

As with any co-operative game though, the people you play this with are key to getting maximum enjoyment, and fortunately my usual fellow AH players are great co-operators.
Good fun!

A very good cooperative adventure game that's dripping with theme. Whereas I don't like the luck of the dice, I find them manageable here because of the cooperative nature of the game. The only downside for me is the lack of leveling that I find an essential part of any adventure game and the luck factor in drawing the items and spells.

Great theme, and I don't even mind the setup time. Games can drag if your investigators are doing well, though, and play gets a bit repetitive later in the game. On the other hand, it makes for good storytelling and is one of the few pure co-ops I can really get into. I do want to try it solo one day, and see if that affects my assessment.

Thick with atmosphere and theme.  A good co-op game of impending doom and disaster.  The sheer # of bits and large beautiful board can cause some initial sensory overload. But once you get used to it and wrap your head around some unique game mechanics this game is quite fun. 
 With at least 2 other expansions, this game will see play for a good long time. Just make sure everyone is fans of the genre or at least likes cooperative games with the willingness to 'take one for the team'.

This one is nearly impossible for me to rate. It is far and above my favorite game, but I am able to recognize its flaws. There is a lot of bloat and the game can drag in the wrong environment. Every time I play, however, I get completely immersed in the lovecraftian horror and the desperate struggle that the game so vividly depicts. Just bring your imagination to the table.

RATING: 7
It's a good game, but I definitely need to be in the mood to play, and my friends need to have set it up and are willing to take care of the logistics of the game, because that's what I find to be the most laborious element.

RATING: 9
This game is the terrible horror that lurked into my game group and, for a while, completely consumed it.  AH is still a popular favorite and is broken out on a regular basis, though I've come around to the opinion that it shouldn't be played with more than four people.  At any rate, as someone who grew up with Talisman, playing the cooperative version with enough Lovecraftian theme crammed in to strain even the most dedicated fan's sanity is just plain great, especially with plenty of expansions thrown in to keep things lively.

A great horror/adventure game set in the H.P. Lovecraft mythos with a rich story. For me this is quite fun if you like Lovecraft or good horror games. Only real things to note is that the game does need a revision at some point to clean up some of the minor parts of the game & it does take up a lot of room. Definitely worth it if it sounds interesting to you.

Logistics are a problem with this one: requires large table, long setup time, long play time. Scale back some of these and I'd play it much more (and rate it higher).

Lore/fluff is fantastic.

Expansions never really added much exciting.

Good single player, although still suffers from the logistical issues.

Good variety of characters and abilities.

I avoided this one for awhile because the theme didn't really grab me.  That said, this one is has so much theme.  The mechanics are so integral to the story and it immerses you in this horror world.  Plays great solitaire which is a big plus.  Lots of rules to remember but the flowchart aids here on BGG help immensely for that.  I wish it was about something else (it probably would get played more if it was), but I can see why people love this game.  It is all about story and narrative and the game itself sort melts into the background while you are playing.

This is a cooperative where you play detectives against the horrors of Arkham city. This is a very fun game with lots of expansions available for it. You can play it solo. I have read the sweet spot for solo play is to use 4 detectives. I've played maybe 2 1/2 games with 1 detective, but found it tough to beat. There's a pretty hefty learning curve. If you want an easier game to start with some similar aspect, start with Elder Sign as it is also a blast to play (and it's cooperative as well, not that I could teach anyone the rules in fast order)

Only played the game once so far. Was a bit taken by the amount of things happening on the board, felt a bit confused really and didn't get that great experience many ppl seem to have when playing it. Would like to try it again though and perhaps my rating will improve when I get more familiar with the game.

Edit: After a second try I´m still not impressed. Simply an overrated game imo.

Played it once and liked it, but it went for a very long time! Although we won quite easily, there was some tension. I would like to play this solitaire because at least then there is no downtime.

I love the Lovecraftian theme and artwork.  It plays a bit like a non-competitive version of Runebound and even shares some of the game mechanics of that game, with appropriate modifications for the Lovecraftian theme.  The health/sanity system is more intuitive in Arkham Horror than Runebound, as you lose hearts instead of gaining them when you are injured.  The game can take a long time to play and can get rather repetitive, but there is some potential for variety with the different gods that you can face and the different conditions they impose on the game.  The expansions also add variety.  I enjoy this game more the more I play it.

If asked to rate this upon my initial honeymoon period with this game I most likely would have given it a strong eight.  However, after a while the elements that compelled me initially began to reveal themselves as too fiddly.  This is an interesting title in the cooperative game genre, but it's length and fiddliness  is unbalanced in regard to the fun it offers.  I would play this title if suggested, and probably have a good time with it, but for cooperative play I will take lord of the rings, and for a longer game give me something with more depth most nights of the week.

UPDATE:  We tore through a couple games of this with the Dunwich expansion, and I have to say that with some time between playing my opinion is more aligned to my original interpretation.  I still feel A touch of Evil might win out over this, but the flavor is strong, and it isn't quite as fiddly as I once thought.  back up to an 8.

Even after EH has been out, I still really enjoy this game. Between the two with a lot of expansions, I like the feel of Arkham Horror more because I enjoy the more build up more in Arkhamn Horror, I just feel more powerful and I have more control of certain things. Also you will encounter a lot more monsters in this game than EH. It's really a battle against monsters/ancient one

EH feels more of an action effective/puzzle since your goal is to rush to completing the mysteries.

Both are excellent but I like the RPG feel more. However AH is a lot more fiddy with the focus counters, rules and especially the monster movement/tracking.

Long (took us four hours) and random co-op. Lots of down time, and you won't be planning your next move because planning isn't the challenge. The challenge is to beat the randomness.

This game surprised me with one thing. After several plays, always in 3-5 people team, I discovered how great is to play Arkham in 2 player mode. Quick and exciting.

Great game! The theme is dear to my heart so added points for that. Also co-op without a dm gets more bonus from us. It doesn't really stay true to the mythos but just the names, places, items, etc pull me right in. Beautiful artwork and components. first time learning is a bit of a task but with aids here on BGG can be done reasonably. A billion pieces! I greatly recommend a pile of little "snack cups" for all the tokens, as well as the set of card boxes that can be "print and taped" here. Game needs a lot of room and quite a bit of time. We spread it over several evenings and all is well. Looking forward to the expansions.

RATING: 5
It is a fun cooperative game. The main issue is the length combined with the complexity. There are a lot of rules and components, which means it takes several plays to get proficient enough to focus on strategy and gameplay rather than just getting the rules right. However, it is long enough that getting multiple plays in takes a very, very long time. And you better not get any new players in your third of fourth play! If you look at the runtime, assume that for your first two games, you will be at the upper end of that range. 

This could easily jump by a few stars if it had a Vlaada Chvatil-like sequence of tutorial games to introduce players to everything. But it doesn't.

This game is my second purchase. My first was Doom the boardgame. It takes a LONG time to play though, so make sure you have at least 2-3 maybe 4 hours for a lot of people before you play this game.Now I've decided that it's not so good. Too long, too luck-based, and definitely not as good as Doom.

This has been the most popular game I have amongst my non-boardgaming friends.  I'm referring to my friends who are still gamers, but don't play a lot of boardgames.  They play far more video games or role-playing games.

The combination of RPG elements with cooperative play really appeals to a group that can sometimes get overly competitive.

Update:  dropped my rating a couple of point on this because it's no longer a game I'm likely to suggest playing, mainly due to game length and downtime issues, but I still enjoy playing it when someone else brings it up.

Update: dropped another point as the length makes it a game that is one I'm unlikely to play even if someone else suggests it unless I'm in the mood for a longer game.

RATING: 8.65
For the first play I made sure to bone up on the rules (did a few rounds solo), separated the pieces into a plano box, and used some good advice from BGG to streamline the learning experience.

We had 4 investigators total, and apart from a few isolated confusing situations, we had a total blast.  The skill sliders are a smart mechanic, as is the monster movement, and the flavor and sense of adventure are all palpable.  The monsters are quite varied, in both challenge and function, and support the mythos well.

The game fell apart at the end when some distractions were introduced, but we all look forward to playing it again now that we are familiar with the rules, and we know how much impact distractions have on the experience.
+++8.5

Update: Played a full game late last night with no distractions, 3 investigators, and one angry Cthulhu!  In just a few turns we were on the ropes, but we stuck with it and won by sealing 6 gates (after extensive psychiatric counseling).  I think we only forgot one rule, the destroying of monsters when a gate is closed, which actually made the game harder for us.  Look forward to playing next time.
++++8.8
Update: We're 3 for 5 and the last game was so easy it only took us 2 hours (set-up + play). I think we've seen the best of Arkham, so it will likely stay on the shelf until I get an expansion.

RATING: 6.9
A very chrome-y adventure game with cartoony Lovecraft elements. I like the fact that it's cooperative, but there are problems- it takes too long, and the tension dissipates rather than mounts. Also, there are so many bits and little maintenance issues that it can feel very fiddly, a problem made worse by a poorly-written rule book. That said, it's good 'Ameritrash', like a very light RPG if you're in the mood.

Arkham Horror is a game dripping in theme. From the character backgrounds to the nifty encounter cards all the way to the uniqueness of each of the big baddies, theme oozes from this game at every corner. This is both a great thing and a bad one. It's wonderful because there is no way not to get drawn into the dark story as it unfolds. 

However, I think it's bad for a couple of reasons. One, the game focuses so much on telling it's story that sometimes I think it forgets it's actually suppose to be more than just a narrative; it's supposed to be a game! A game with difficult choices, carefully laid plans and above all an under current of tension. Am I making the right move? Will I save Arkham or am I leading us to our deaths? At the end of the day this is an adventure game. For any adventure game to work I have to feel my choices are more than just a painfully obvious reaction to a randomly drawn event. No matter how strong and beautifully crafted the narrative, I have to care about the character and the adventure they're in. At the end of the day, as sorry as I am to say it, I simply do not find the Arkham Horror experience captivating. There is no [i]tension[/i]. If we lose I'm usually annoyed that we wasted a few hours and when we win I usually saw the win coming a mile away and am just happy to have it official.

I feel Arkham Horror has great components and an enthralling creepiness that can get into your bones but the mechanics make me feel like I'm just going through the motions. It doesn't help that, with the base game, my group very, very rarely loses. It's like going through a four hour long obstacle course when you know the finish was never and will never be in doubt.

Huge fan of this game, if I was better at tracking my plays my number would be much higher. I love the horror theme and Arkham Horror does and excellent job sucking you into the theme with a sense of dread and hopelessness. It is one of the greatest moments to feel like your losing the game only to win out in the end. That being said if you don't plan as a team 8/10 times this game will beat you into the dirt and then cast your soul into the endless nether. 

You do not have to be a Lovecraft fan to appreciate the horror, but understanding Lovecraft's style will help you sink further into the story and appreciate the justice this game does for the genre. 

The one mechanic I do not like is the all or nothing dice rolls. You tally the number of dice for an event and get one roll at it, in other games like Fortune and Glory as long as you get 1 success you can keep rolling. In Arkham Horror you get one chance to get all your success. While this helps play to the feel of the game its very frustrating to envy Fortune and Glory when you roll 10 dice and get zero success.

Wow!  This is an interesting game (I'm not going to say good). There is so many possibilities and so many options.  Sometimes it doesn't seem like it though, due to all the terrible things that need to be managed.  When the pressure is high, there are turns you don't really get any choice in your actions.  That's alright though because this is not really a game where your plans matter. This is a game that takes over and shows you an adventure, one that you usually don't think you'll survive.  It's true, with good planning you can put off the trouble for a long time, but the chaos always seem to catch up to you.  This game is at its best when you let go and try to ride the wave of the chaos.  Surf it, and you may survive.  Fight it, and you will definitely lose.  
  Now for the bad parts. This game has terrible setup and tons of fiddlyness.  Most of all, this game is not for everybody.  This is not a game for someone who likes perfectly laid plans.  This is not the game for someone who has places to go. It takes time to build the story, and the worst thing you can do is rush it. 
  In order for this to be the game that people rave about, the group must accept its fate, and play the game the board wants.  It must be allowed to grow, and the players must be allowed some freedom while teamwork is mandatory.   Practice doesn't hurt much either.  This makes the game great for the single player who wants to experience a story.  It is really good for a group that wants to experience a story, though the smaller the better (Do Not play with six or more players).

what to say, one of the best games I played and enjoy to play with my group.You can feel the lovecraftian air and theme in the whole game. A very good coop game that puts you against the great ancient ones, evil gods who see earth and us like little ones to crush. battling them and cultists and wathever happens there, andventuring through the streets of the omonomous city, you have to discover what lies in the dark and ensure the safety of the world.
game better played with expansions and with a good company of 4 people...

An excellent fully cooperative story-telling game dripping with H.P. Lovecraft's 1920's horror theme.  I love the flavor text and the character enhancements are a lot of fun.  One of the few moderately complicated board games that my wife is willing to play (and ultimately why I rate this a 10).  We can't get enough of this game in our house!  I highly recommend "play as you go" style learning so new players don't get too overwhelmed from the beginning.  Recommend all the official expansions, and lots of great unofficial expansions here too: https://neilscuriosityshop.wordpress.com/board-games/arkham-horror/

Arkham Horror stand out from a lot of games I have played. Plus , both hard core and non gamers play this (often at the same time) and the group thoroughly enjoyed itself. Drawbacks include too many components (making gameplay clumsy at times), Steep learning curve and A LOT of rules to remember. To this day I'm not certain if I've ever played a game correctly as the designer(s) had intended. I think Arkham Horror is a great, innovative game that I don't get to play as often as I'd like. Highly recommended.

The game takes a long time, and there are just so many bits and pieces to take out and set up. That being said, the game provides great stories, great experiences, and usually a lot of fun. 
I do feel that a lot of the game is "missed" through each playing, as some locations are just about never explored, few items are drawn, etc. I guess this adds to replay value, but it also feels like the game could have been cut down and streamlined to create a quicker, smaller, more efficient and inclusive play experience.

This could easily become one of my few 10s if only I had people to play with.  There's so much to keep track of solo-playing (I've played with 3 investigators) that it is hard to really get into character and develop a strategy.  I'd love to experience it with 4.  I think more than that and you'd be just doing it for the experience of a large-scale group game rather than for enjoyment.  But that has yet to be discovered.

One of my favorite solitaire games, I usually play with 3 characters at the same time, less and you have fewer options and more just becomes a little unwieldy.  What makes this game a great game is the theme, great atmosphere and can get pretty damn tense even when playing alone.  Even though there are lots of cards, I think setup is easy and streamline.  On top of it all, I think the mechanics of victory, closing and sealing gates or confront the ancient one really works and remains very thematic.  I can recommend this to anyone that likes a little fantasy.  The expansions are not really necessary, even though I own most of them.  But they do add a little variety in play.  Like most I don't mix more than 1 large and 1 small expansion in any one play, or you'll dilute the cards and hence the theme somewhat.  

Can't wait for an expansion-expansion to bring all the expansions gameplay and story altogether.

I'll give this one another chance by trying to play a few solo games before we play it in a group again.
Maybe our disastrous first game was that bad, because we had to look up so many rules.

-> edit: still not my game.

Takes way too long.
Too much luck for such a long game.
Almost no tension (at least for me). It's a boring game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very thematic game with lots of variety in characters, situations, items and monsters. I especially enjoy the genuine feeling of panic and desperation when the game is going badly and the horrors slowly conquered Arkham. The rules also offer enough chances for making relevant decisions, so you actually feel like you have influenced the outcome. The lenght of the game may be the factor that keeps it from hitting the table too often, but it's not too bad when everyone knows what they are doing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Quite simply the best co-op game I've played.  It has wonderful variety, tons of great art and bits and it plays well.  Some games are closer than others but when you get a good game, man, is the game tense.  Overall, it overcomes the cooperative puzzle sense that most games of this type naturally have by giving you tons to do, many options, and lots of wrenches in the works of your best laid plans.  Creates a great narrative, second only to the best narrative games, Fields of Fire or maybe Magic Realm.  

I'm not sure I'd want to play this with more than 4 players.  I am quite happy with it as a 2 player game with 4 investigators.

Plays fast and isn't very fiddly once you get up to speed with the rules as well.  Main problem is that once you are pretty experienced, at least w/4 investigators, the base game is rather easy.  That is changed by the expansions which bring it to its full potential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Arkham Horror plays best without the additional boards from the expansions, they add too many spaces and detract from the central goal of the game, saving Arkham form the clutches of a Great Old One. The smaller, card only, expansions are fantastic though, and add a great deal of flavor and variety to the game. Don't play Arkham with 8 people, that's just stupid. You CAN do it, but it will really, really negatively impact your experience as it will take forever for your turn to come around. To speed things along I very much recommend one person (the one most familiar with the rules) act as sort of a referee and draw the encounter cards and read them aloud so everyone can feel involved at the plight of the active investigator. 

The components of the game are of very high quality and the artwork is both thematic and visually appealing. The wide variety of monsters, characters, items, spells, and Great Old Ones ensures that no two games are ever the same. The rulebook could be better organized but after a couple of plays the games flowed smoothly and were a blast, even when we failed miserably and were eaten by the monsters or the Great Old One.

Being a fan of the original version of this game, I had high hopes for this game.  The art is beautiful although the art work is so dark, it is actually tough to see it, especially the board itself.  I do think it is nice and moody, so I may lean towards the darkness rather than the reprint.  The game is rich in theme, but can drag a bit.  Some of the personality is lost from this game in comparison to the original.

Finding anything you are looking for in the rulebook may cost you sanity, even if you have played the game a few times.  If you are a fan of Lovecraft, you will enjoy the game I think.

The original was more streamlined but had poor production quality.

I wish I could rate this game higher, I really want to, but the definition for 6.0, "Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood," accurately describes my rating of this game.  It would get a higher rating if a typical game was not so long, we didn't have to constantly reference the rulebook during gameplay, and there was less game pieces to deal with and sort, all of which detract from the game, which is clever and enjoyable.

The most rich, beautiful and engaging game of all.  A monstrosity of detail and moving parts (which may be house-ruled fairly - I routinely do this with the monster limit/outskirts/terror track mechanism in a way that slightly enhances difficulty but reduced fiddliness and constant handling of monster tokens)), but incredibly varied with all of its expansion materials in place.  What it lacks in variations of theme by AO (AOs provide background conditions but generally not specific encounters in a game session), it makes up for in replayability - an endless diversity of location and other world encounters and mythos combinations, and the array of investigator characteristics and starting possessions (in direct comparison to Eldritch Horror).

Historically this was one of our favorite long games, and it's still one of my favorite cooperative games. Good theming, although of course it's the "modern" take on the Mythos in that it lacks the sense of the weird, mystery, and the unknown of the original stories. It was extremely popular at our son's college, where they'd play massive, marathon games that included all the expansions.

RATING: 6
This is a game that used to rank higher for me: I still love the theme and the things the game is trying to do. However, it's one that no longer makes it to the table often. I attribute this to a few things. First, the game is intimidating: there are a lot of parts and cards and places to go. The rules are not streamlined, and between set up and explaining it to new players, we've already eaten up a large chunk of time. It also doesn't scale particularly well to low or high player counts. It is still fun, at the sweet spot of around 4 or 5 players, but there are other, newer games with the theme or the co-operative style that are more streamlined and fun to play.

Up for trade on account of never having time/group interest to get it rolling. It's awesome, don't get me wrong, but it's taking up space at this point.

I somehow ended up with a bunch of extra counters, monsters, etc. I could part them out, but I'd rather just include them with the base game and expansion in a trade/sale.

Tried it for a while, even got the expansions for it, but decided that it's ultimately not for me after all this time.  It was the game that opened up my eyes to the greater world of board gaming (beyond Milton Bradley and Parker Bros.).

What ultimately made me sell it off was the large number of dice rolls used (don't prefer games that are too luck-based that last this long), the co-op gameplay (learned that I normally don't prefer games that are entirely co-op), and that the fun was gone when I learned of better games that are out there.

A cooperative game set in Lovecraft's universe. It has quite a lot of expansions as well so if you like it there are lots of things you can add to the original game.

The Game:
As I have already said it's a cooperative one. Setting up the game isn't difficult, there are just lots of things that must be placed conveniently around the board. The purpose of the players is to prevent the selected Ancient One to enter our dimension by sealing the open gates or to defeat it in combat if they don't manage to prevent its entrance. For the fight there are lots of mundane and magical weapons and artefacts.
If they want to stand a chance against the powerful Ancient One and its minions  players should make a common plan, share items and generally help each other and that's why I like the game so much: you must talk with your fellow investigators, come up with a plan and then adjust it along the way.
Even with a low number of players it can take a lot of time if you are unlucky with dice and events.

The Box:
Very well organized and with a bit of care there is place for everything. Using small plastic bags to keep tokens separated helps with the setup of future games. One thing that should be improvised is an "urn" from which you'll extract monsters. Another good this is you have either on the back of the box or inside the manual an example on how to set up the game on the table.

All in all a nice game which I'm willing to play again and can't wait to introduce the expansion/s as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Long and quite a lot of rules, but really rewarding and fun at the same time. A real adventure, where you have to establish a connection with your character and fully cooperate with others if you want to succeed. You need to develop your character (no levelling here, but you gain items and skills), but also be ready to go out of your way to save your team and the world at the same time. The thick, dark atmosphere makes the experience even better. If you like Cthulhu themed works, it's a must have.

Reason for selling: Either this or Eldritch Horror. The latter won.

RATING: 6.5
This lot includes ALL expansions.  Great game all around. All of the expansions make this a huge game.  Lots of set up and lots of clean up, but tons of fun in the middle for both theme and game play.

I have played this dozens of times, but that was before I was recording plays here.

RATING: 7.5
I like really long and immersive games. This one can get a little too long... I've played with just two investigators and it is nigh impossible. I've played with 6 investigators and had a game last 6 hours. 4 investigators seems to be the sweet spot. The pacing is much better and the game resolves around 2 or 3 hours. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Despite the hopelessness that one feels about actually beating this game, and despite it being rather difficult, it's actually really good. The theme is what really drives it for me, but it can be quite long at times. As per usual of the FF games, it's a bit fiddly, and comes with a billion expansions.

Despite the length, this is one of the -best- co-op adventures games ever made. A lot of fun if you like heavy theme, and lots of bits.

Arkham Horror is a 1 to 8 player game in which the players play the roles of Investigators of the supernatural trying to avoid doom brought forth by an Ancient One (something like an evil god). It has been said that this is a game for Lovecraft fans, but it is also a game for horror fans in general and for people who appreciate difficult games.

From 1 to 8 players.
Ages 12 and up.
Playing time: 120 to 180 minutes

Lovely co-op Ghostbuster-type game in Lovecraft setting. Beautiful. Makes me think of old Talisman sessions, with all these borads and cards and character/role-playing feeling. Love that to. It takes a while to play but honestly, this is one I don't mind spending time on. And the Old One will make sure the game end eventually, whether the players want to or not. :)

Love it!

House rules I play with all extensions in (most not from my creation):

* When you draw a task or mission (from Dunwich Horror), you can immediately discard it and draw another card. Rationale: these cards are mostly useless, and the decks are diluted enough already, but still someone might want once in a while to try one.

* When you make an Other World encounter, roll a die. On a failure, draw cards until you find a card matching your color and exact location, on a success, draw until you find a card matching your color but not your location. Rationale: this avoids the dilution of the deck and having too many “Other” encounters.

* The Ally Deck is generated in the normal manner: draw 11 from all those included in the setup. The remaining Allies form the Ally Reserves. When you draw a random Ally, use the Ally Deck. If a specific Ally is required (for instance during an Encounter) then the player searches both the Ally Deck and the Ally Reserves. If the Ally needed is found in the Ally Deck then no extra action is needed. If it's found in the Ally Reserves the Ally is taken then one random Ally is transferred from the Ally Deck to the Ally Reserves. If you are instructed to return a random Ally to the box, (for instance when Terror Level increases), return the top Ally from the Ally Deck, along with two from the Ally Reserves. Rationale: it is annoying to be instructed to look for a specific Ally and realize it's not available (which happens most of the time when playing with standard rules and all expansions).

* When using the Bast guardian (from Kingsport Horror), Bast's Favor is triggered when an elder sign is removed by a gate burst, and any player having a Bast token takes the Bast cards (the first one in turn order if more than one player has a token). Rationale: This powers up the Guardian which is pretty useless otherwise, and actually allows the event to happen (drawing The Stars are Right in the all-in deck does not happen that often). It also gives a small help when a quite bad event just happened.

* Characters, Great Old One, Herald, Guardian, Institution are chosen by the players. Rationale: this is to avoid way too easy or way too difficult games.

RATING: 4.5
I really wanted to like this game, but the poorly written rulebook and convulted or vague game rules really put me off. We spent an hour just trying to figure out how certain aspects were supposed to work. Couple that with the issue that players are left waiting with nothing to do while others resolve encounters, and you have the makings of a game that needs an overhaul. This is a game that sounds intriguing but just doesn't play out very well. I will look for alternate rules and check out rule changes and errata online, but I doubt we'll ever play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent cooperation game, but certainly VERY luck dependent.  There's also a TON of stuff to keep track of, which makes it easy to miss something on a card or tile.  Reminder cards for turns would be handy.  Overall, a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A lot of randomness, but that keeps it from being as much of a set-piece game as some other cooperative games. The game also tends to work with any level of commitment from players, from "how do I shoot this guy?" to "the optimal sequence for those tasks is..." -- as long as at least one player is committed enough to be able to answer the question "how do I shoot this guy?" when other players ask it. This makes it a better gateway game than its complexity would lead one to believe. 

Theme is a very important part of this game, and one of the big oversights there is the lack of tension, and the ability to plan for a particular old-one's weaknesses from turn one. To address this, I use a variant that slowly reveals clues to the old one's identity instead of flipping him at the beginning of the game -- usually this one: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/299333 or something similar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An enjoyable cooperative game.  It is solvable without variant and house rules so replayability is somewhat limited.  The biggest drawback is the game's excessive length.  If it was half as long to play it would be twice as much fun.

RATING: 10
This is the best game ever. All my family loves it. We had an 8 player game: 2 (grand)parents, 5 brothers and sisters, 3 wives/husbands, grandkids sitting on laps. We just beat Cthulhu. First play of the game for everyone except my wife and I (I am one of the brothers and sisters). We all loved it.
Its the deep, deep, theme. Based in 1920's gumshoe/detective/Marlowe stories with a creepy twist. Everybody gets it. It doesn't matter if you've never read every single Lovecraft story ten times over like I have. My wife has no idea about any of the Mythos, but loves this game. Made me buy every expansion.
I ran the game (like a GM), smoothing over the rules, presenting each newbie player with a simple set of choices which everyone could follow from what our current 'missions' were. The rich flavour brought each player into the game and they all felt part of the team. One player is trying to close a gate while another is gathering clues, someone else is killing monsters to clear the streets, etc, etc, etc.
You do have to pick and choose from which elements you use from the expansions, but they are great for introducing a bit more challenge after you get the hang of the strategies.  
Its a great game, and you will find you keep forgetting some rules (like monsters in the sky, or fiddling with focus) but none of that matters. 
Its normal people against the cosmic horror. Everything is against you. Everything. 
And yet (after a few failures) you do prevail. What a feeling.

However, even though it is not a game for me does not make it a bad game.  However, the "fun" comes from the complexity and not from the depth which is a big boo for me.

RATING: 7
This game has a strange attraction for me. The mechanics of the game feels a little too old school for my taste, but there is generally nothing wrong with it. The rule book has room for improvements as there are many rules and it is hard to find what you want to find in it. Especially annoying is the other rules section which could have been incorporated with some other rules. I don't think it is generally a rule writing flaw, but more of a design flaw where the game is so free form that you have stipulate rules so that it is controlled instead of having it cleared up in phases. The sheer amount of rules doesn't help.

That said, I like the game, because otherwise I wouldn't rate it as highly as I do. I like the dual nature of the game where you have to think about either closing gates or prepare for the GOO to arrive. I think it makes a better game to really close the gates even if it isn't always beneficial. But what's best with the game is the theme as it is wonderfully incorporated in the game. The experience of the game is wonderful and is like playing in another world. The many different investigators and GOOs make this game feel different every time. I also really like the narrative of the game, but there is something that keeps me from wanting to play it more than I do. The game takes ages to finish and even though I don’t mind long games, this is more an experience game than strategic game to me. Strangely, it’s so simplistic, but convoluted at the same time.

There are many expansions to add to this game. Sometimes you want an epic experience and add all things together, but generally I prefer to just add one big expansion to the game and maybe several small expansions. Otherwise it gets bogged down with all the rules.

Awesome game for the Lovecraft aficinado in all of us; it has high quality cardboard stock game pieces and jaw-droppingly beautiful (and beautifully horrific) artwork. I enjoyed seeing references to some of my favorite Lovecraft stories and characters peppered throughout the game.

All the praise aside, this game has a rather lousy rulebook. I have read it three times, played once (last night), and only NOW begin to understand how it functions. The index in the rulebook is anything but helpful at times and the layout of the sections pertaining to gameplay seems to have been cobbled together in some cyclopean, indescrible, foetid manner (as I type this I wonder if it was done this way on purpose).

Aside from that complaint, we had a very good time playing with 7 investigators and I do hope that our group can play this game again (perhaps in the way that the rules actually intend this time?)

RATING: 5
One of those "experience games" that I don't mind playing once a year or so. There are a lot of moving parts on this design (particularly when compared to other cooperative games like Shadows Over Camelot or Lord of the Rings), which means either additional detail, or additional clutter, depending on how you look at things. Plays well enough when an experienced player "gamemasters" the thing. Generates a narrative, a fun bit of mutual solitaire ... but I can't see every playing it again, now that the in all ways superior Eldritch Horror is available.

I'm a little torn on this game - it's fun, I love the sense of dread that *can* be evoked while playing, but there's something about the actual play that is a little utilitarian and bland. There are a lot of bits and items and spells and monsters and such that make the whole experience quite a production, but it still feels pretty simple: move, draw, maybe fight, roll some dice. I think it takes the right kind of group to make this a really absorbing game...

Arkham Horror is a great alternative to role-playing games.  Hell, it is a role-playing game.

AH's use of its theme is amazing.  The rules are convoluted (by this I mean they are complex and not intuitive), to say the least, but none really feel like after thoughts or pasted-on.  

The game is an exercise in futility but when you do actually manage to win (and win honestly) it feels tremendous.

Great immersion into the threatening Cthullu Mythos. Much more of an atmospheric experience than Betrayal at House on the Hill which seems
far to simplicistic after playing AH. Rating after two plays with 3/4 player that took around 4 hrs (without rules expl.). I was impatiently waiting until it was my turn again. So I dont think I would endure downwime with 5 players. I understand that the flavor text on cards is important for the athmosphere but I prefer to separate it from text which instructs me what skill check to do and what the consequences are. This would speed up the game and I could rate it higher. I am also under the strong impression that FFG could have done better the monster cards (usabilty: indicate the Horror/Combat strength/losses clearer).

Played once. An OK game, needs some player cooperation. But somewhat felt lame. Can't put the finger on it, but there's something that didn't feel right. 
Nevertheless I'd be willing to play many more times, I'll update as soon as I get to play more. And change my mind.

I'm sorry I'm basing this only on one play.

***UPDATE***
OK game, SLOW... I mean SLOW. The ancient thing needs not to bother because the investigators will die of old age. It is easy to get stuck, but keeps being fun. Gave it a "6" out of "6,5".

UPDATE
Re-played this on vassal. With the right crowd, and in less than 4, it is manageable and delivers a light hearted fun experience. It is going back up to 7!

Played a 2p game, took way longer than either had expected as didnt really have a grasp on the game or we missed something critical. Good fun, very thematic, itching for a replay and try to get it right next time

So i finally got around to giving Arkham Horror another chance today. Played a solo game with 4 investigators. Its much much better once you know what the hell you are doing. Took me about 3.5 hours, so vastly better than the first time i played it. Verdict is its good, you obviously need to like coop games, but its pretty thematic, its like playing a good book or movie. My rating will probably go from 6.5 currently to 8 i think. Its an epic, but i had fun, and i would imagine it'd be a fair bit more enjoyable with other players too.

As with other Fantasy Flight titles, this one's a tough sell. It takes a long time to play and a long time to teach, and the terrific theme is drowned in bit-fiddling and complex monster movement rules. A drag without a little role-playing.

But since is really a story driven game unless you get a version in your language the players need to be fluent on the language that you get it. It is a great solo game for the few of us that love HLP stories, but can´t find a group to play it with.

I really love Arkham Horror!  My wife and I have had hundreds of hours of good times playing this co-op game and it is one of our most enjoyed games.  We actually like all of the fiddly bits, can crank out a typical game in under 2 hours, love the artwork, and we get to work as a team!  It's all good.

If you are a CoC fan, you'll love it.  Otherwise, you may find it long and tedious.  Overall, AH captures the feel of the setting and the components are first rate.

**Update:  After a few plays (group and solitaire), I have to downgrade this one.  While it has its moments, and a great theme, the play just seems disjointed.  I'll stay at "7" for theme and components, but I seriously dislike the gameplay.

Ambitious, intimidating and super long. The setting is interesting but the madness theme doesn't really work because it's quantified in tokens. That level of abstraction makes it closer to a currency so you don't feel attached to it.

It has great potential and production values but the random elements seem to overpower most of it.

I'd rather read one of the books.

Két dolog vezetett hozzá: Lovecraft és hogy jó ideje nem vehettem részt szerepjátékban. Mint szerepjáték pótlék sokáig megállta a helyét, de szép lassan rutinná vált a játék, nem hozott újat, ezért inkább fárasztó lett a több órás társasmaraton. Nem nehéz játék, de jó ha van az embernek rálátása, hogy mik történhetnek a játék alatt. Így az is betett neki, hogy többnyire én gondolkoztam a (az utóbbi időben inkább újonc) többiek csak tették amit mondtam.  
Jó emlékeim vannak róla, de nem sikerült túl gyakran olyan játékot összehozni amit mindenki és végig élvezett.
Ezért nem is gondolkodom abban, hogy kiegészítőkkel dobjam fel.

Arkhamm horror is a fantastic abstraction of a classic RPG.  Cooperative play is necessary in order to beat the game, and offers every player an opportunity to contribute.  It's all about the story-telling, and if the players choose then the game isn't about "read a card, something happens, roll a die, advance the turn marker" - it's actually about visiting the Silver Twilight Lodge, poking around in back, finding a mysterious book that reveals the nature of your very soul (by transporting you to Another Dimension where you need to escape something so horrible that the designers didn't put a picture of it on the card!)!!!
It's easy to mistake the game, I think, for a "turtle resources, wait for the perfect opportunity" game, given the size of the board, the height of the objects decks, the obvious options, etc. However, the rough-and-tumble, "get out there and mix it up strategy" is a lot more fun, and in my opinion, effective.  Team work is essential, and a great part of the game's charm.

The rule book is mediocre in terms of reading, and absolutely painful to reference. The game itself is incredibly punishing, and kills my will to live another day every time I play it. So why do I continue to play it...because it's probably the only good Cthulhu game that will ever be made and the painful, hopeless, pointless experience of actually playing the game is 100% Lovecraft thematically and I love it.

Played 40+ times with the wife, that's enough to make it almost a 10.  Length and setup are the only thing holding it back, but that's half of the fun of it too.  Infinitely replayable -- especiallly with all of the expansions.  2p use 2 characters each for best experience.

RATING: 7
Great theme integration and some very interesting mechanics (especially monster movement). A bit too many dice rolls, though. Enjoyment of the game rises exponentially the more you're familiar with Lovecraft's work. 

Bumped down recently - after a considerable amount of plays, the unmodified game turns out to be rather easy with any number of players, making variants a must. The mechanical aspect of turn resolution gets a bit boring and also killing off most monsters is easier than it should have been - I feel this goes against the spirit of Lovecraft's work. However, this is a game after all. 

Also, the game becomes rather anticlimatic with an experienced group of players - instead of an increase of tension, there´s a comfortable plateau of bookkeeping. This is unfortunate.

I liked the easy encounter resolution, as stats are always easy to understand.  On my first play the owner was kind of overwhelmed with questions (my fault).  I had hoped that players might have had some cooperative combos (like Ghost Stories, where they're nearly required) rather than everyone singly going about doing their own things.  Some discussion about who was going to do what on their turns helped bring back a little more coop rather than solitaire feel, however.  Looking forward to future plays, hopefully to get more into the atmosphere of the game.  Hopefully I can firm up a rating, and perhaps adjust up or down with more experience.

If you're a big fan of H.P Lovecraft like me then this is the first boardgame you should ever buy. The sheer amount of variability with the added 2 small expansions make sure that no 2 games will ever play out the same way. I also love the harsh difficulty, it's very appropriate to the Lovecraftian world.

RATING: 7
Probably the most thematic game I own, the quintessential "thematic game". This huge game mixes tension with chaos and somehow manages to create a world of it's own in the players' imagination. And even though you and your team mates will likely die a horrible death, it's almost guaranteed you'll want to play again! I've played this solitaire, with 2 players, with some expansions, and also with ALL expansions, and it's always a blast.

RATING: 8
The 2005 version keeps that same basic theme, but game mechanics are greatly altered. Players assume the roles of characters who travel the town of Arkham and other worlds in order to close gates and kill Cthulhu monsters.  In the 2005 edition, all the little rules tend to slow play.  ie - "Wait, how many monster is the max for 4 players.  What does a green border on a monster mean?  Do monsters move before or after the Headline takes effect?"  After some time learning the subtle rules, however, game flow increases and is worth the effort.

Very thematic and fun game, but oh so long.  There's a definite sense of urgency and terror, though the game seems to balance itself out quite nicely.  There are quite a few fiddly bits to this game and a lot of stats to keep track of with variables, so inevitably things are overlooked, but it doesn't bog the game down.  Looking forward to another session and actually finishing the game.  We were a couple turns away from defeat, with only the faintest glimmer of hope to win.  Wish we could have seen it through, but five hours later we had to call it a day.

Okay, this one is growing on me.  Despite the long play time, it's a great game for its purpose.  Thematic and chaotic, but with enough strategy to keep all players interested, this is one that should be in my collection for those Sundays when you just want a light, fun, co-op to kill a few hours. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I want to love every co-op game, but Arkham Horror is very hit-or-miss.  About a third of your games will be exciting and/or close, but most of the time you either blow the Ancient One away or get totally owned.  A game with this level of time commitment should deliver every time.

Even when you do have a good time, some player usually falls behind through bad luck and doesn't have fun.  That's a dealbreaker in my book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Too many small rules... BUT, so darn good! The game is based on storytelling more than any other games except maybe Tales of Arabian Nights which is about storytelling in the end. Eldritch horror is a bit more than Arkham Horror, but it is a lighter version of AH but is brand new, and is only inspired by AH.

Buy at least the base game and Innsmouth horror or Dunwich Horror expansion. You need one (or both) of these to make your gaming experience reach another level.

Arkham Horror is good on its own, but those two expansions brings it to an excellent game.

If you are not afraid of small rules and love thematic and games that tells you a story as you play, buy this one. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A cooperative, card driven story based game in a Lovecraftian setting. Accidental heroes move around a city's many locations in order to hinder the advancing nameless doom that is realised just fine by several interdependent game mechanisms. It seems that this premise is near impossible to mess up. 

I had enjoyed the '87 Chaosium edition for many, many years. The new edition is - quite simply - an improvement in almost every regard: atmospheric art, suspenseful descripitions, myriad of items and small details, perfectly produced without changing the essence of the original. To me, it was an instant classic the first time around, but the new edition rounds wraps it all up in an amazingly thematic package and makes it accessible for everyone. 

A big plus in my books is the fact that this game works perfectly as a two player game!

Arkham Horror is a beautful and intricate psudo-roleplaying game, with dazlingly high-quality components (FF game components are getting more and more impressive with every release).It is rather more complicated than say Betrayal at House or even Runebound, and it is purely co-op, (There's no traitor unlike Betrayal or Shadows of Camelot). Looks like it will have a lot of replay value too, especially with the variable GOOs, Investigators and an absolute ton of cards.

I'm a little ambivalent about this title.

From an artistic and thematic point of view, this is an excellent game.  The art is fantastic, the world is immersive, and the mechanics create a very pronounced feeling of overcoming overwhelming odds.

On the other hand, game play is often not that satisfying.  The game tends to drag after a few hours, and it often does not feel like there is much player choice.

I still enjoy this game, but between the length of play and the passive game play, I don't see this hitting the table more than a few times a year.

I recommend Elder Sign, a game with a very similar theme, but the gameplay is much shorter and much more satisfying.

Lovecraft világával kapcsolatos társasjátékok megismerését az Elder Sign-al kezdtem, majd az egész világra őrületet szabadító Eldritch Horror is nagy kedvenccé vált. Volt alkalmam kipróbálni a híres elődöt is, majd sikerült nagyon baráti áron magyar nyelven is beszereznem. Rengeteg hozzászólás, vélemény került megfogalmazásra, amely a két nagydobozos játékot hasonlítja össze ezzel együtt viták sorát generálva, hogy melyik játék a jobb és miért?
Általános véleményem az, hogy a két játék nagyon jól elfér egymás mellett. A játékmechanizmusok egy része az Arkham, a másik része az Eldritch Horror társasban került jobban kialakításra.
A játék egyik nagy előnye vitathatatlanul, hogy maga a kezdődoboz is teljes játékélményt garantál többszöri újrajátszásra is, valamint, hogy elérhető magyar nyelven.
Választott nyomozóink keresik, kutatják a rejtélyes történések okait Arkham utcáin át-átkeveredve más dimenziókba, elkerülve vagy legyőzve a megjelenő szörnyeket akár az épelméjük feláldozása árán is. Közben folyamatosan újabb kihívások nehezítik karaktereink dolgát, azonban a kezdeti kilátástalanság akár reménnyé is változhat, ha a csapat összedolgozik (mert itt csapatjátékról van szó, néha be kell vállalni az áldozatot egy nagyobb jóért).
A szabálykönyv nehéz falat, nem tudok elképzelni egy első játékot hibák nélkül. Szívesen ajánlom, hogy a szabálykönyv lapozgatása helyett döntsön a csapat és majd a játék végén keressék meg a helyes értelmezést. Az egész hangulat rombolója a játék közbeni túlzott szabálymagyarázat keresés, esetleges vitatkozás az előtalált értelmezésen.
Nagy erénye a játéknak, hogy jó csapattal különleges hangulatú játékban lehet részed, ahol kicsit is beleélve magad a nyomozó háttértörténetébe többet ad, mint egy munkáselhelyezős, lépésoptimalizációs, euro típusú játék (szerintem).

If I had to say about the only thing this game has going for it is that it is thematic. Here are the problems that keep me from enjoying it:

1. The manual doesn't list a way to scale difficulty, which is a huge problem. The game is way too easy with 4, in fact we are 6-1 with 4 having only lost our very first game. It is fairly hard with 2. We have about a 50/50 win percentage with 2, but generally it seems to come down to things that are out of our control. For example, we drew a wicked Mythos card with a continuing environmental effect that was spawning 2 monsters each time. With 4 players something like this would be ok, but with 2 it makes things unmanageable. I don't want to have to rely on half baked and untested ways to adjust the difficulty. I have read many posts and people have ideas, but I don't want to play a variant that has not been tested especially considering what a time commitment this game is. 

2. The best part of the game is usually the middle. Generally speaking I like a game that builds up to a grand ending. This game is fairly procedural for the first few rounds as you try to get good items, Elder Signs, and clue tokens. It gets interesting in the middle as the board starts to fill with gates and monsters. Then there is a point where you have sealed off several locations and you know you are likely to win, but it still takes another hour of play to do so. It is very anti-climactic and often the game ends with a thud. I have only ever had the ancient one awaken in 1 of 11 games, it was a 2 player game and I still won. The rest of the time it was trotting around sealing up a diminishing number of gates with the board completely under control. 

Generally speaking I can't recommend this game. People say you can add expansions to make it more difficult, but the game is already a chore. I shouldn't have to add another board and a bunch more bits and pieces to make the game work. The game should be scale able in difficulty regardless of players, and likewise the difficulty shouldn't vary much at a certain level regardless of player count. Pandemic, for example, does this very well.

A great game, but too many rules and too many arguments with the people who played it with me, needs a better group of people, better after you've had a few play throughs. 
The killer part of the game is the "boss fight" once the old ones awaken. where the game quickly goes from been fun to tedious dice rolling... A real shame that the concept was there but the end game is not.

Worth a play with the right people.

Not a very fun experience. Cumbersome, fiddlyrules, overly busy art and very little payoff for the time invested. The climax basically boils down to a grinding dice fest.

The game tries to be both an RPG and a boardgame, but ends up being neither - it lacks both the immersiveness of a true RPG and any interesting co-op boardgame mechanics. 

I'm sure it can be fun with the right people and in the right circumstances, but it's not for me. 

Sold.

Nice setting. Beautiful markers. The board is a little bit too cluttered for my taste. Game is not all that challenging, I feel, by sealing gates at the unstable locations. Even with the updated rules, it is not too difficult to beat the game.
All in all, a good game but I lack some atmosphere and more strategic choices. Problem is that the game is pretty straight forward.

Why not 10. Although base game is great by itself I found much more fun to play in Campaign mode and that mode is not supported by the game unless you download extras from internet. (Some of them Official extras).
The game is long, yes, but it is said as such in the box. You can't rate this 1 because it is long, you were warned.
The game has lot of randomness, same as an RPG, but is randomness you can control in a way, or alter, or manage. You won't just lose just because...
Every match, either win or lose, feels great. If you win you celebrate as a group, we sometimes even hug and cheer during very difficult matches. When you lose you get stuck thinking how to win next time, and feel thrilled to play it again.

I´ve enjoyed Arkham Horror a lot. It´s a really nice game if a) you´re a fan of Lovecraft´s, b) you can turn off your number crunching brain and just enjoy the mood of the game, c) you are into cooperative gaming. With the right group of people, it´s a blast.

Now that I´ve played AH for a few years, I have to say it has held its edge very well. The rating stays.

There are also some very good expansions for this one. FFG really is great in supporting their older games.

El Clasico juego de investigación y aventura Lovecraftiana (ojo, no lo digo yo, lo dice la caja xD). 

Padre de El Simbolo Arcano y de Las Mansiones de la Locura, Abuelo de Eldritch Horror, Guia de la docena larga de juegos existentes hoy dia basados en los mitos de Cthulhu, y uno de los juegos cooperativos por excelencia del mundillo. 

Bueno. Ahora no es como cuando me pilló a trasmano hace 4 años que no habiamos jugado ni media docena de juegos y  nos asustamos con solo mirar el manual. :D

El juego es duro... duro de pelotas. se nota que algunas cosas las suavizaron en el posterior Eldritch Horror. 

edit. despues de 3 partidas, mi valoracion de la jugabilidad y del juego en conjunto es muy buena pero con algunos altibajos. algunas mecanicas demasiado repetitivas le bajan nota, y no es tan inmersivo como su sucesor Eldritch Horror. Asi todo es una experiencia de juego, parada obligada para todo lovecrafter que se precie, y sigue siendo un excelente juego. 

pd. No se si calificarlas de "muy buenas", pero las cartas de este juego llaman la atencion, son casi losetas, de lo recias que son. la leche.

I originally rated this game a 5, but now, after playing with the Dunwich Expansion, I feel compelled to change my rating.  The expansion makes Arkham good again by rocketing up the difficulty level.  This works because it greatly enhances AH's main strength: its theme.  With the game a challenge again, the tension pervades through out and I can recognize AH for what it is, a desperate battle for survival against almost insurmountable odds.  I love it!

This addresses what we didn't like about Pandemic (see review). It does this by adding masses of complexity, pots of dice and hours of play per game, but it's definitely worth it. It looks great too and the Cthulhu theme is brilliantly realised.

This game has some interesting concepts. It's fun the first few times you play but becomes very VERY predictable after that--even with the expansion.  I would like to see these mechanics honed into a different game (or modified within this game!) in order to see what they are truly capable of.

Good game and I still enjoy it, but played it too much at some point, hence rated "only" at 7. All plays were done before I started recording them. (28.3.2016)

This has the same pros and cons as Eldrith Horror so I updated its rating to reflect that (to 6 from 7). Read my comments on EH if you want to know more. (8.2.2017)

RATING: 10
A very nice collaborative game. Takes a few hours, but is interesting most of the time.

When playing with expansion boards, it is usually more fun to play with a single expansion board than with multiple boards.

This game is a typical 4 player game. With three players you cannot close gates fast enough. With 5 players it already takes a bit too long. Should only be played by 5 players, if everyone is experienced enough in the game to play a bit faster.

A few pointers to the expansions:

The Dunwich expansion is kind of a must have. The Dunwich board makes the game more balanced.

We usually play the Kingsport expansion kind of reversed, i.e. if a Mythos card places a clue in Kingsport, we spawn a gate there, and place the clue where originally the gate would have spawned. Otherwise, you can usually ignore Kingsport completely.

Innsmouth expansion is also fun, but Dunwich is better.

Unwieldy at times, but normally enjoyable.  I will never play it with more then one expansion at a time again.  That keeps the bloat down, and makes the game varied enough to keep coming back for more, when the mood strikes.

You move about then draw a card, then roll a dice, then spin a spinner, then draw another card. Overlong, player decisions mean relatively little due to everything being random, theme reliance makes the game terminally dull if you don't enjoy Lovecraft. Will not play again if it can be avoided, but would play if I was feeling like not thinking and drinking a beer or two along side it.

Im really excited about this game. The first complex game (Iguess you could say) that I have played. So far I have played a few times with 3 people just figuring it out. We got owned every time but still has us wanting to play more. Great game with heavy theme that is so much fun. 
- Third play with 3 players and we finally had the rules right. We hit it hard from the get go and won by sealing 6 gates. Good fun. I like this game.

RATING: 9
Great Game.  I've played several solo games and a few 2 and 4 player games.  Now I have played with the 7 and it still works!  (Update: well over 50 plays, still awesome)

I think the skill distribution choices and the resource management is the meat of the game, at least in my experience.  Aside from those two things its a game of reacting to what happens to you.  The broader strategic choices usually aren't that difficult, though in a close game they become very important.  I do not like AH as well as War of the Ring, which is what I traded to get Arkham.  However, I can see that AH might well have more replayability and a greater appeal for non-gamers.  This is a great game.  Arkham played very smooth and was not very clunky for something with so many different decks of cards and piles of chits.  I am going to give it a preliminary rating for now, but the rating will probably go up with more plays.  I do not regret trading WotR for it with the WotR deluxe on its way.

Update: the game grows on you the more you play it, and you realize just how deep and interesting the gameplay is.  Probably the biggest "every game is different" factor of any game I've ever seen without a modular board.  I've played it with 7 players, and it mostly worked, especially if you keep people moving to decrease downtime.  Some weird balance issues and I think we would have creamed the GOO if we had our shit together from the beginning.  We had one guy that horked all the clue tokens then didn't seal a gate, but we still won.  Pretty damn funny.

The flowchart player aid on BGG really clarifies things.  My biggest gripe is that your turn to turn decisions are not very interesting and a lot of games it makes sense just to load up with guns and wait for the great old one, which is totally anti-thematic.

2011 update:  Just upped the rating on this, because Arkham stands the test of time like few other games.  Years later we still play this on a regular basis when most games of Arkham's vintage are reduced to a once or twice a year playing.  Every game has a great story to it, and there is always unpredictable stuff going on.  The group planning element is fantastic and the game mechanics create a very real sense of dread and foreboding.  One of my all time favorites.

Just bought it for my husband's birthday and tried it out. We loved it, and can hardly wait for the next play, but we left out some rules at first. The rule book seems a bit  complicated first (none of us has ever played the game), guess it will get better.

Update: the second play went much better and we really enjoyed it (time flies by,really). This is a preliminary rating though, it may drop with time when we see how big the replayability is.

A cooperative game. The thing with coop games is they end up being a session where one experienced player basically says "Here's what we should do" and everyone does it. It's fun, but there is an air of constant hopeless struggle. When the win is in sight, there is relief, and rarely are you derailed at that point, but it happens. The base game is good, but can be quite long. The perfect number of player, imo, is 4 for both timing and mechanic-balance.

Only one play, and I can see it could be a very different experience if I played again. Even so, we won with barely any trouble at all. Not a lot of tension here. One turn we had a serious problem, but we immediately fixed it and then cruised to the win. I don't like the randomness of some events or the amount of cards that make you lose turns; that makes it slower, not harder. Loved the components and theme though. The slider system of stats was very cool as well. For a co-op (which I tend not to like) it was pretty good, and it didn't feel as long as it actually was.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very deep and long game. Good for friends to while away a summer day outside (though you might want to be careful not to lose any of the hundreds of small pieces). Good cthulu feel and can be a good game to play with normally non gaming friends. Bigger groups than 4 should have someone to run the game and keep the game running right. Expansions add RIDICULOUS amounts of crunch and if youre not careful it will clog up your game.

I go back and forth.  I want to like this game a lot more: I'm a huge Lovecraft fan for one thing; and I do appreciate the game in a lot ways-- beautiful components, a lot of activity to track, a lot of options, great story-line element, etc.-- but somehow I've just been bored during some of the gameplay.  There's a lack of any real tension because actions can play-out in a fairly auto-pilot type of way. Solo is definitely not good.

But I've also had some great games.  Enough so that this is high on my list.  It's a very rich, story-driven experience and plays out with RPG-type of overtones.  Still, I'm always dubious about which game experience I'll get when I crack open the box-- tense and fun or automatic and dull.

Maybe expansions are important here?

There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, but I really enjoy this game. 

I love the theme of the game: Investigators rally together to stop an Ancient One from waking up and destroying the entire world. 

With all the expansions the cards and pieces easily number in the thousands, so if you don't like that kind of game, don't even go near it. But if you do, the gameplay is fun and addictive. 

If it didn't take about 2-3 hours per session, I'd play it a lot more often, but it is still a favorite of mine.

One of the only three good horror games in my opinion. The theme is great and there is a lot of it. There is an air of tension that rises quickly through the game and each Great Old One changes the game enough so it's a different experience but not so much that you need to memorize another few pages of rules.

Plays best with 4 people and under and plays best when players really take their time and get involved instead of speeding through their turns. Also great for solitaire play.

I rate this a ten because this was my first real boardgame and this is what sucked me into the hobby. This game can do no wrong in my eyes.

This is a good game, when played with the right people.  When everyone pays attention to what's going on, and think ahead of their moves, the game plays relatively fast.

RATING: 9
Once you get the mechanics down, and that will take some time, you may start to enjoy this game. I really recommend to play solo games to get the rules and concepts down, unless you are in the lucky position of having someone to teach you the game. There are a lot of rules, a lot of concepts you just have to wrap your head around, and it will take some time and effort. Also, you will find that there are a lot of rules that are easy to forget during the first gameplays.

Dunwich Horror expansion is strongly recommended. Game plays perfectly a as a solo game (play with 3-4 investigators), although this is a cooperative game that is more enjoyable with 3-5 players.

Tough to get into, and to keep momentum going the first few plays. It's not an elegant game, your motivation in what to do is not clear until you've played a few games, or if you're playing with an expansion that'll force your hand.

But, as some other web author put it: "The game knows". Through the chance of a card draw, or the predefined movement of an enemy, or a failed dice roll, the game will put you in a world of hurt. The game just "knows" what you are doing, and where you were going.

It was a great reward to finally defeat an old one (it took us many a game).

Setup time gets quicker with practice, and you'll need a large table to host anything more than a 2 player game (God help you if you have any of the expansions Edit: which I now do, and purchased an adjoining picnic table!).

Strap yourself in for a beer or a glass of wine - you'll be playing it for over 2 hours a game.

Edit: After many plays, I'll give it a 10/10. It's not perfect, but it's one of the few games I enjoy even when I lose.

Cool adventure game that has a lot going for it but might not ultimately work for me because I like the discovery aspect of it. Playing the same scenarios won't be too exciting after several plays and that is a drag. On the fence about buying it, but I would defintely like to play more.
Update: I caved in a big way.

Finally got to play it!  Lately I've played a lot of games 'on steroids'; San Juan on steroids (Race for the Galaxy), Geschenkt on steroids (Lascaux)... This is more like Shadows Over Camelot on acid.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I'm not likely to buy it but would play again any time.

Aug-09: Very good game. Played twice yesterday. First game was a little bit slow in the beginning but then when everybody got the rules it went very well... almost, since we lost the two games. But it was fun, nonetheless. Played with five players, it was very heavy on the players, but maybe it was because we were beginners.

Mar-11: Rating dropped from 10 to 8 due to playing and setup time. But still it is an amazing game.

I feel that Arkham Horror tries to tell a story instead of providing interesting gameplay decisions. Betrayal at House on the Hill provides a similar experience in a fraction of the time required to play this.

- Infuriatingly long
- Shallow & outdated mechanics
- Very random
- A lot of unknowable information unless you have memorized all the cards beforehand
- Horrible rule book (things like flying is left unclear)

With the variety of entertainment options that I have at my house right now, including the new Harry Potter book and a new Xbox, I keep finding myself wishing to play a solo game of Arkham Horror.  I've enjoyed playing it everytime I've opened the box and I look forward to playing it several more times in the future.

Plus, Arkham Horror is also the game that prompted me to join BGG.  That's got to be worth a high rating, doesn't it?

The classic Lovecraft adventure game where you play a member of a team trying to prevent an old one from awakening and save the world.

Somewhere between 2 and 5 hours is common.

Downgraded my rating from a 9 to a 7.  We don't really play this game anymore for a number of reasons.  It takes far too long to setup - lots of fiddly chits, too many decks of cards, etc.  It takes a long time for a new player to learn, so getting new people to try it isn't easy.  It also takes a long time to play.  It's abnormal if the game itself lasts less than 2 hours.  More often, it's 4-5 hours.

That and the gameplay just isn't that much fun.  There's a fair amount of thinking, cooperation, and strategy, but not much action or fun.  The combat feels very weak and unless you're decked out with weapons, your characters never feel very powerful.  I suppose they're investigators, not warriors, but when tough enemies come out and you have to constantly avoid or run away from them, it makes you feel weak - how could you possibly beat a GOO if you can't kill a simple monster?

However, the randomness of investigators, enemies, and cards does have a benefit.  Each game can feel very different, depending on what's going on the board and who is able to do what.  There is a strong sense of cooperation and once you get into the game a bit with the right group of people, it still is a very fun game.

This was the game, more than any other, that got me (as a lifelong Cthulu Mythos fan) interested in modern boardgames.

The reported complexity put me off buying it for a long while, but I inevitably gave in and bought it recently.

I've not yet had a chance to play it. Before I attempted my first solo playthroughs in order to familiarise myself with the rules, I put together a foamcore organiser based on an excellent design posted elsewhere on The Geek. ( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/416770/arkham-horror )

Now that the tray is cobbled together I hope to try my first game soon!

So very atmospheric despite the abstraction. It really triggers my imagination, and the mechanics also sits very well with me. It only took me two or so plays (none of them all to the end) to get the hang of the rules. I still miss a thing here or there, but nothing that ruins or disturbs the game. I can really see myself going for some of the expansions once the base game has gotten some plays.

Excellent, even on a 1st play, though I suspected I would definitely love it (as a Lovecraft fan from before the 1st edition).  Lots of rule hunting at first, but definitely a winner.  The Maximum Head summary is also awesome for this, and was a real help.

Raised to a 9 after two plays- just a lot of fun. Playing through all the characters in random groups of 3, against all the Great Old Ones randomly until all defeated BEFORE adding expansions (Dark Pharaoh 1st.)

RATING: 6.5
Played 3 times solo, and twice with a full table. The game has its merits, with the feel that the team is cooperating towards a goal, but it's rather hard to get there if you don't get everyone to agree soon on a strategy. I'd rate the game very alpha-prone. At least for me.

The randomness of much-everything doesn't suit me that much.
The theme isn't my prefered either - I bought the game at the time because it was highly rated on TricTrac (the site that used to be good), full-coop and solo-capable.
It hasn't aged all that well in my view, just because it's a fairly long game to play. If I liked the theme, I'd probably call this a keepers, still.

I don't, so this game is on its way out. ;)

RATING: 9
Great board game for roleplayers, especially those interested in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. I've used this game as the template for an RPG session. My only gripe is the endgame which resembles Runebound too much (or less charitably resembles Monsters Ravage America). When Great Cthulhu shows up, everybody should die -- that's how we play. The idea that characters can use their Tommyguns to waste Cthulhu is simply not keeping in the spirit of Lovecraft's genre of cosmic horror. It's like ants being able to kill the exterminator sent to wipe them out -- it's ludicrous.

I would give this a "10" were it not for it's very long playing time.

Game has great replay value and plays good solo.  When playing with the right group, it's like a story being told.  Dripping with the Mythos theme, but I don't think you have to be a Lovecraft fan to enjoy it. All the expansions add lots of flavor but I don't recommend playing with all of them at once.  Then again, that's just my opinion.  For my game play tastes, I think adding [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21059]Dunwich[/url] or [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40776]Innsmouth[/url] with the   [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25945]KiY[/url] expansions works great.

RATING: 2
Too much downtime between turns. I was knocked down last turn. Then, when it's my turn, I stand up. Next. Just shoot me.

Update (1/26/11): Let's be honest... I'm never going to play this game again. It may be a rich gaming experience, but the gameplay sucks. It's a '2'.

Update (10/31/12): Someone recently commented that this was more complex than TI3, so I had to reexamine my thoughts about this game. In terms of game mechanics, it is aggravatingly trivial, with few meaningful choices. BGG user Daveboy's [thread=661908]review[/thread] has very specific points that I could not articulate back then (emphasis mine):

[i]...you spend too much time in a [b]mechanically uninteresting[/b] area, which is traveling through other dimensions to close gates. This is basically an automated move-and-draw-cards step for your character. It's totally random, and [b]you don't make any interesting decisions[/b] while this is happening other than the decision to adjust your character's statistics.... 

Arkham Horror just leaves too much to chance and, too often, [b]does not have interesting stakes[/b] on the gambles. There's a point where a game crosses the line into being a "dicefest" and Arkham Horror is purely in this territory. There are just too many times where your turn ends up being, "which of these random events should I subject myself to?" with [b]no clear idea of what the outcome will be[/b] if you win or lose....

It just feels capricious and slapdash all the time, where you can't really plan anything or make a long term strategy. [b]You're constantly reacting to the variance[/b] and while this can be fine... when your choice is to roll the dice one way or roll the dice another way or roll the dice a third way for slightly different losses or gains it starts to blur together. [/i]

The only difference is that it took me only one play to come to a similar, emotionally-based conclusion--Daveboy played AH for two years before coming to his own conclusions. There is something about this game that pissed me off, right from the get-go, and the above stated points are exactly what triggered my response. While I can appreciate why people like this game or this kind of design, it is these kinds of game mechanics and design philosophy that I will be wary of in the future.

Update (04/16/2014): A [b][i]far superior[/i][/b] implementation of the Cthulu mythos can be found in [b][thing=141517][/thing][/b], which is actually a Lovecraft/Cthulhu/Sherlock Holmes/vampires/zombies mish-mash. In terms of game mechanics complexity that actually [i]convey[/i] a sense of theme, Arkaham Horror feels more like [thing=5048][/thing] by comparison.

Nice and thematic Lovecraftian cooperative game. Suffers from and odd backwards tempo: The threat is biggest at the beginning but slows down as the game progresses and gates get sealed.

[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] "PLAY FOREVER"[/COLOR][/size][/center]

An RPG in a box, playable in a single evening.  It's a lot of "pull a card and read the encounter" followed by lots of dice rolling.  If either of those mechanics bother you, stay away.  If you don't mind (and I certainly don't) then this is the best of the genre.

[b]PROS[/b]

- A rich and detailed experience.

- High replay value. 

- Cooperative play.

- Solo play!

- Art and production values to die for.

[b]CONS[/b]

- A sprawling rulebook with almost no summary.

- Little rules that are easy to miss, and change the game when you get them wrong.  (For example, we overlooked the fact that closing a gate banishes all monsters with like symbols.  This made a lot of really awful monsters hang around much longer than they would have otherwise.)  Expect to play the game incorrectly several times.

- The final battle is nothing but dice.  (Who knew Nyarlathotep could be defeated by nothing more than the world's longest [i]Yahtzee[/i] game?)

- It's long.  Really, really long.

[b]BOTTOM LINE[/b]

[i]Arkham Horror[/i] is thick, meaty and completely immersive.  This also means it takes a while, but that's not always a bad thing.  It fills an evening to brimming with blood, terror and good clean fun.  Recommended for players who enjoy the [i]Call of Cthulhu[/i] RPG.

UPDATE:  After several plays, the game is becoming easy—almost too easy.  With a crack team of selfless, team-playing RPGers it's a pretty simple thing to win by sealing six gates or closing all gates while having the requisite gate trophies for victory.  This drops the game to a 7, but it still gets the extra point for the whole Mythos thing (and the fact that it's easily handicapped).

UP-UPDATE:  I have realized, with much dismay, that there really is no "horror" in [i]Arkham Horror[/i].  It is extremely rare for anyone to get devoured, so much so that no one really ever worries about it at all.  Also, the characters don't "wear out" like they do in the RPG—they are not eroded by repeated contact with the mentally-corrosive Mythos.  Again, house rules will fix this (by having max sanity reduced by 1 every time you fail a Will check), but still, I shouldn't have to put the horror in Arkham...  It shoulda been there in the first place.

My rating holds at an 8 for all the kicks in the knickers we get out of the experience, but just barely.

UP-UP-UPDATE:  Forget all the whining.  The expansions fix everything and take the experience to a well-deserved 10.  So, an 8 for the base game, a 10 with any expansion (especially Dunwich—goddamn Dunwich).

ALSO:  Have the First Player act as the "Interim Keeper" by drawing and reading encounter cards for all players.  Makes it way more fun when you don't know what your choice (or failure) will bring when you have to make a decision.  Allows for more storytelling, too.

FINALLY:  I will always use the Injury & Madness cards from Dunwich and the Final Battle cards from Kingsport in every play.

PS.  Played once with 8p—NEVER AGAIN.  The sweet spot is most definitely 4p.

(Includes one each of the [thing=155643]Blessed[/thing] & [thing=155645]Cursed[/thing] dice sets.)

I really wanted to like this. I love the Call of Cthulhu RPG and I was delighted when the old, and very hard to get, board game was re-published (re-imagined may be a better term).

Unfortunately after four plays I still hated it. It seems like a cross between a shopping simulator and a management game.  It takes too long to set up and too long to put away. It takes too long to play, which considering how much I disliked playing it, could be any amount of time really. 

I think it appeals to people who like the Rube Goldbergesque intricacies and watching all the moving parts and they update various tracks and add tokens, obviously taking account of the tons of rules associated with everything that happens.

So far I have played several solo games to learn the rules and be prepared for questions from my fellow players when we meet.  I can see the potential.  With the right group of people who are not afraid to play an indicated roles this may be a blast.  Is it possible to win solo with The Curse expansion?  Seems impossible... I will try anyway... three games in 2 days mean that this is a good game.

Update: too repetitive (actions not events) and too long to keep the interest and more importantly all the players must have a good command of English.  Otherwise, it is a pain in the neck.  There is too much text to read which halts the gameplay.

I prefer Descent for a thematic game. It plays much more smoothly and is more engaging.

Inspired by my Secret Santa I want to explain my rating of 1.  The game takes too long.  When it is not your turn you don't have to strategize for your next turn.  You simply have to wait until it is your turn.  There is a lot of board maintenance (moving NPC monsters, advancing counters etc.) and if you are a quick player in a 6 player or more game you will spend very little of your time playing Arkham Horror actually playing Arkham Horror.  I strongly recommend instead playing Elder Sign.  There is not very much board maintenance so in a 4 player game you should actively be doing something between 20% and 25% of the time.

I have played Arkham Horror multiple times and I never understood why I needed to make any decisions.  I didn't feel as if I had any agency (agency: my decisions matter and can meaningfully alter the outcome).

If you don't love the theme of Lovecraft I would recommend you stay away from this game forever.  If you prefer tic-tac-toe over chess then this may be the game for you.

I have to agree with SDaSU review after playing a 4 player game.  Its long, its thematic, its random.  As they stated, 'The game plays you'.  I can certainly see the enjoyment of the storytelling and as one reviewer stated, you kind of have to treat it like a light RPG where the board is the gamemaster.  The bits are very nice and the game board is nice to look at if not a bit complicated till you sit and play.  The biggest bummer is the lack of cooperative play.  Sure, there is a little bit of interaction and sometimes skills of other characters can help you, but not often.  You are pretty much on your own for any task.  It's very difficult to find enough movement points to join a friend for coffee and trade an item or get a boost from their skill when interdimensional gates are opening across the street.   Pro: Very thematic and sets a great mood.  Con:  Clunky combat, frustratingly random, and not enough real co-op in my opinion.

Cons:
-Poorly written rules can make the game confusing at the beginning while its actually a rather simple game.
-The story in the game is badly implemented. Events on the cards are extremely lame and spoils your mood for the whole thing. I expected something rather interesting event at the Witch House f.e.
 -Decision making is close to zero, its always too obvious what one should do, (at least at a solo or 2 players game) just go for the gates asap while try not to die. Seriously, you could write a script and just watch the game play itself.
The most fun game I had was probably the one where I didnt go for the gates but used my time to prepare for the end fight. And probably the only one I won. 
-Some of the creature cards look bad. 
-Rolling insane amount of dices. 

Pros:
-The combat system while isn't complicated, you can put some tactic in it and it feels somewhat interesting. 
-Item cards are very well made.

In Arkham, games play you. 

2 of 3 times you are just making optimal moves. 1 of 3 times you make some sort of decision, but as everything is so random, no matter what you choose, your success or failure will be determined by luck.

This game looks complex without being deep. Your brain is busy following the game's algorithm, but there is little strategic thinking here. 

Thematically, however, it has a point. The "fighting against the odds", the fluff text of the cards, the lovecraftian artwork, the cooperational aspect... all this creates an atmosphere of play that can be rewarding. In this sense, this game is closer to Talisman than to Pandemic (or any other cooperative games), and maybe that's why it's the only coop I can stand. You have to play ocassionally and with the right group.

EDIT: I have eventually sold it. I would still play if asked, but it was so heavy and complex that it rarely hit the table.

Played it with a very high player count and therefore it took forever. Will test it with 2 players and will see if it changes my rating.

RATING: 7
I love the Ctulhu mythos, co-operative mechanics and sense of despair. Expensive as hell (with addons) but still I think about buying this. Mechanics are bit overwhelming and sometimes it feels complex just for the complexity.

Eldritch horror does the same - but with better rules and shorter gametime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Awesome theme and design. Coop game could be more interactive (a gripe I have with many so-called "cooperative" games), long to build up, very long to play (3-7h). Play-wise it is actually counter-productive to buy expansions, since each of those will further drag out the game. Still, a thorough recommendation for any Chtulhu-fan.

I'm not sure how fair this rating is, as I've only played it once, but it was pretty awful. Took about 3.5 hours with no real meaningful decisions.

I like the setting for this game, it plays out a bit like a story with ever increasing tension. I do sometimes miss the fact that it's not player vs player, but that's what you get when playing a co-op game I suppose. We do seem to agree on the rules more easily for this game however :)

AH is very much an experience game.  There is a lot of randomness, which will turn off many people, but there is also a lot theme.  AH also has a lot of rules with lots of little rule based details.  It claims to play with up to eight and I'm basing my rating off of one game with seven players.  I'd recommend keeping the total number of players down to three or four as down time is a big issue with more players.  Still, even with seven players, the game kept my attention and drew me into the "story."  Recommended most for those who prefer theme over strategy.

RATING: 3
I know i'll get heat for this but, after setting up the game and reading the rules for a solitaire game, I packed it up and posted it for sale. Ugh is there such a thing as having too much theme? Yes I love thematic games, but I like it within mechanisms that make thematic sense, not novels of flavor text, dice rolling, and burdens. It feels like anyone who enjoys this is a masochist. The "theme" people rave over this game is all in the flavor text. "A Man sitting in the back, stares at you as you walk into the bar. His eyes burning through your soul it feels, you lose control of perception and reality...roll a die and see what happens!" 

Wait, what?!? Yeah, it's stupid. This is my problem with pure Ameritrash games, theme is great, but it all comes down to dice rolling and more dice rolling and reading gobs of text and luck, and you have a 4 hour long game that should've been over in 60 minutes.

Setup alone takes 20-30 minutes. I couldn't even imagine trying to explain this monster(no pun intended) to people. Let alone the fact it can take upwards of 4 hours or more. I'm not opposed to playing long games, I would still love to try TI3, but that game has a ton of variety from what I've seen. This game is just brutal, brutal brutal with more dice rolling than a game of Craps. 4 hours just to almost always lose?...I'll pass

I still would like to give Eldritch Horror a try since it's been called a more streamlined Arkham, making for a quicker game. But does it fall into Arkham's same tripes, just in a shorter play length? I will more than likely not, since it's getting just as many expansions and as bloated as Arkham.Also, Seeing as how I dislike both Arkham Horror and Elder Sign, I guess the whole Cthulhu and H.P. Lovecraft themes are dead to me. It doesn't help that Cthulhu is being thrown at us ad nauseam, seriously a Cthulhu themed Pandemic! Tides of time!....and a damned racing game as well! I thought I would never say this but bring us more zombies and dungeon crawlers please. Cthulhu is a scrub and over-rated at this point.

This game looks very good.  The components are great, the art is amazing, and the theme is very cool.  The game is complex to understand for a bunch of people that have never played.  I played 2 turns of a game, and it took 2 hours.  We gave up then.  I'd like to try it again, but I don't know what kind of time investment I'm really looking at.

I only rate this a 5 because the experience is so much dependend on the shuffling of cards and the people you play with. 
Sometimes this game is a 10, sometimes a 2 or worse.
And it is best with only 3-4 imho, there is too much downtime when played with more.

Easily the wife and I's favorite game. It does a great job of pulling you into the lovecraftian universe and telling a story that is a little different every time. The toolboxiness of the expansions means you can mix and match parts to get your play exactly how you like it and also keep things fresh. Only loses a 10 because the pace can drag early-mid game, especially with lots of players.

RATING: 7
Awsome. A great cooperative game (it struggles for the second place with Shadows over Camelot, and loses to BSG). It's only drawback is the fact that it takes a long time to set up all the components. Also, usually, it's a long game.

RATING: 5
While this is a very thematic game, it completely fails at representing the works of H.P. Lovecraft in any meaningful way. That's a major disappointment for me. I need to play it more to decide whether or not I like the game itself, but I'm still waiting for a decent horror themed game that does the subject matter justice.

Yup, it's kinda long.  It's mostly about reading text from cards and it's not really a strategy game  at all.  But, you know, I really like reading text from cards.  And like most cooperative games, it's really about counting up the possible things that can happen or need to happen, and I enjoy that process, too.  Everyone I play with thinks it's too long, and they're not wrong, but...

I moved this one up to a 10.  It oozes with theme, and games are always very different.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.  I've played quite a few times and never felt like it plays out the same or that it's too easy or too hard.  Plus, with all the expansions, you've got so many different items, encounters, monsters and characters that nothing ever seems recycled.

Being a proud "Cthulhu fan" badge owner I almost felt obliged to give this game a full 10: best co-operative game I have ever played, with stunning artwork and reeking with my beloved H.P. Lovecraftian theme, it is our groups favorite! Unfortunately some game mechanic problems (The infamous gate closing problem that causes the game to become a bit boring towards the end) keep it from really going to the heights, even though many variants and the expansions help the situation a bit.

EDIT: After buying all expansions to date and many, many games of this not-so-little gem, I have upped it's rating to the rightly deserved "10". I'ä, I'ä!

UPDATE (February 19, 2017): After giving Arkham Horror more chances at changing my initial reaction, it has failed to do so. The game is just too cluttered and burdened with a swarm of rules that makes playing the game practically impossible. I just can't keep up with this nonsense. This is really depressing.

UPDATE (July 8, 2016): Second attempt at Arkham Horror is pending. Going to give it another go and see if I can improve my experience and give the game a better rating. Stay tuned...

Arkham Horror was a big disappointment for me. I had looked forward to owning/playing it for years, only to discover that this game is overly complex. Let me reiterate... not JUST overly complex, but complex to the point of mindless, confusing busy work that I simply couldn't keep up with. Ironically, this goes perfectly with the Cthulhu Mythos theme. Why? Because trying to understand the instructions and play the game will drive you insane! I couldn't even complete six turns (which took a whopping 3.5 hours) before I gave up and put it back in the box. What a massive letdown.

Dropped the rating a bit because it's getting a little easy.  Granted, my last few games have been with 6 people, but even with just my wife and I (with 2 investigators each) we tend to win with little to no trouble.  Perhaps we should try just one investigator per?

RATING: 9
This game is great and very suspenseful.    I've never felt the need to expand it in my five years of owning it, because I felt there is a lot of replayabilty right out of the box.

I usually play it once or twice a year.  The reason it doesn't hit the table more (and the reason why I did not rate it a 10) is the time it takes to set up, play and put away the game, from my experience is somewhere in the realm of 6-8 hours!

Still, even with that.  This game is worth every penny, has tons of replayability right out of the box, and provides the players with a very challenging and engaging experience where literally anything can happen!

Me and my partners in crime also found it incredibly easy to role play the part of our investigators, providing some really memorable experiences that I will never forget!

Easily one of my very favorites!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very complicated at first, but once you get the flow of the game down it becomes fairly easy.  Played with my semi-gamer wife with each of us running 2 investigators and she did great.  It seemed a bit easy to win once you get the idea, but I'm going to try some variants to add to the difficulty.

Adding the king in yellow expansion really ramped up the difficulty and added to the pressure, adding both the king and dunwich made for a satisfying difficulty and made it feel like you were really working AGAINST something instead of just sweeping up messes.

I enjoy this game so much, but it is very difficult to bring to the table. There's a lot of bookkeeping that scares off most players, and the play time scares off the rest. But when I can get it to the table, it really shines. I want to get the expansions to really bring up the play time. Ha!

One of my favorite board games ever as long as it's played:

- With four or less players. I can still enjoy games with more than four IF there's one very experienced player who can smooth over fiddly bits (calculations, looking up rules) for less experienced...else the game can go way too long.

- With players who enjoy role-playing and heavily-themed games, and are not just focused on winning.

What can I say?  It's my favorite game so far.  The expansions add to the insanity.  Definitely FFG's trophy-game.

Not a fan as it tends towards mini-maxing munchkins and very dense rules.  Long play, many pieces, uses the same mechanics and concepts of every other Cthulhu based board game (because they are all licensed by the same company and use the same designers, making them all horribly identical).  Only played 3-4 times, in excellent condition.

Even a good hour and a half before my first game ended, I had started to feel everything drag.  I think with a faster ending mechanic my rating would jump a couple notches as everything else was nailed in respect to mechanics and atmosphere.  The luck was a bit chaotic on card draws and constant die chunking but I wouldn't expect anything else from the nether creatures of Cthulhu, servants of discord!  Erm...Ah-hem.  The game has definite potential.

Quintessential Ameri-trash. Dripping with theme, hundreds of cards, bits, character sheets and tokens, a huge game board, a 30+ page rule book, 1+ hour to set-up, average about 4 hours to play; so many rules and situations to keep track of, half of the game is remembering what rules are currently in effect and keeping track of the ever-growing collection of monsters, gates and other evil popping up in Arkham, only the hardcore need apply.  That said, there is a lot of fun to be had here.  As a cooperative board game, all players are playing against the game system rather than each other.  As the spiritual big brother to 'A Touch of Evil' by Flying Frog Games, there is much to love in it's core experience, but thanks to a seemingly endless supply of big-box and little-box expansions, the game is constantly evolving and changing.  Just make sure you have a lot of room on your game shelf!

RATING: 7.75
Monster co-operative game.  Many degrees of freedom.  I imagine you could play this a lot and never see the same thing happen twice.  Probably also takes a couple of plays to become proficient at allocating your characters (and their special attributes) around the board.

Recommended to play the first time with someone who really knows their way through the rules.

Jun08: Well, it delivers exactly what it promises.  3 hours of horrific, dice chucking adventure.  You get out what you put it.  I played it in a jovial family environment and had a pretty good time weathering the storm.

It is a coop, and can suffer from the "you do this" if you let it.  There also aren't a lot of really deep decisions.  You can however tailor how you want to play the game by somewhat controlling how your player develops.

If you want a coop adventure game with tons of replayability and great thematic trappings, Arkham is all for you.

Just don't come here looking for a cube pushing Euro.  This is about theme and dice rolling.

This is the first board game that I thought was "fiddly" with all of the card movement/shuffling, chit (monster, gate, clue) placing, counter (terror, doom) counting going on every turn.

But, I consider it to be a very fun cooperative-adventure game. Once I've play it 10-20 times I'm sure I won't feel that it is too fiddly anymore.

I'll let you know.

** UPDATE ** - Well, I've played it, along with expansions, over 50 times and what I still find fiddly about it is trying to keep track of your limits (open gate limit, monster limit Arkham vs. Dunwich, outskirts limit, also monster surge size, and how monster surges work with Dunwich...whew) which are defined by the # of players. I find it challenging to keep aware of those limits since they are not tracked visually anywhere on the board. It might have been good to include a way to visually display those things somehow on the board.

RATING: 6.5
Played it 10 times now.

Most games are not nail bitters (when compared to another co-op like pandemic), they are too easy or impossibly hard. This can be frustrating.

The luck component is huge, meaning many plans can fizzle before they can even be started. More monsters arrive and disappear due to the steady stream of mythos cards than our staggered actions.

I don't think I get much enjoyment from the theme, so that part is wasted on me. Perhaps Robinson Crusoe will work?

We tried to make house rules for 2 player (skip every 3rd mythos) so we can attempt to close gates instead of purely shooting the elder God each time. But I'm not really interested in designing and tweaking a game: developers should do that.

Also there are simply too many things to remember, even after becoming quite fluent with the game I would still forget to roll for blessings occasionally.

Some stable locations simply never get visited since players will mostly be in the street for a monster fight, at an unstable location for a clue/gate or at a stable location for a heal/purchase.
Further most spells and tomes are horribly underpowered, yet again more content which will never be explored.

Printing the unofficial flow-chart player-aid was needed during the early days.

It just feels like a badly designed game.

But I can't deny that I have had a lot of fun playing the few nail biting games and a lot of enjoyment from immersing myself in the oversized scale of (mostly unbalanced) content.

To those that enjoy this game, I envy you, since I really did try to make it work and had a lot a patience waiting for it to bloom. To the others which hate it, I understand you now.

Ideal Players: 3-8

Description: Explore Arkham while fighting monsters and closing portals. Cooperate and work quickly, or the world may end!

Pro: Great cooperative gameplay. Tells a thrilling story of horror and adventure. Fun random mechanic of drawing monster tiles from a bag. Each character has a special ability.

Con: Things can get very hard, very quickly. There are lots of fiddly bits to keep track of. You need someone who knows the rules forwards and backwards, or the game quickly bogs down.

Owned for several years, attempt to play this roughly one or two times a year.  Too long for what it is.  I find that for the majority of the time I'm busy with upkeep and managing the board rather than making decisions or engrossed in the theme.  Marginally better as a coop than solo IMO (seems impossible RAW with one character, not worth the headache of running more).  I've probably set this up and put it away before finishing it more often than not.

In short, Arkham Horror does what it sets out to do very well.  At its heart the game is a dungeon crawl. The bits are good and the feel of the game is faithful to H.P. Lovecraft novels.

Oodles of color and a decent game underneath it.Several things make it a very good party game: 1) only one player really has to understand the rules; 2) partly in consequence, it accomodates playstyles ranging from "my spreadsheet says we should do X" to "How many dice do I roll?"  As a result, 3) people can play it without learning the rules up front, enjoying the color and drama, slowly learning the rules through play.

While the game has a Lovecraftian theme, it feels more like an adventure game than a horror game (which I don't know can be done in a board game).  This game should be played with 4-5.  While it can go to 8, the down time was just far too long.  That experience (8 players, some kids under 18, and our first time playing) put me off the game for a long time.  Luckily I tried it again, and realized that a good game was there.

Dreadful. If playing board games is about making interesting decisions, this is one of the most boring ones I've played. Sure, you do get some sense of what you need to do (gather clue tokens! close the portals!), but as soon as you start actually working on the problem, random bullshit starts happening. 

On one of my first turns, I went to the Black Cave for some clue tokens and got sucked into the Other World and got delayed. This meant that I could spend entire 3 rounds basically doing nothing of use. So much "fun". And yeah, next time I'd know about it, but I do not play board games to memorize what event is on each of the 20 locations or so. Especially when those are drawn from a deck so there's more than a few possible outcomes.

Thinking of it now, this reminds of "Monopoly". Sure, you have the freedom to choose where to go, but you still just go places and throw dice to see how you respond to things that happen to you. The culmination of that was the end of the game when we fought the Might One. It had 44 hit points and we could throw just 2-4 dice each most of the time. Because of that, we spent the last 20 minutes of the game trying to beat that thing, knowing that we'd lose almost certainly.

Finally, I've heard this argument that the randomness with a focus on negativity is supposed to convey the dread of lovecraftian horror. Well, maybe. But to me, frustration does not equal the fear of the unknown and the unseen. Neither does blasting off a monster's tentacles with a shotgun. Some might say that it's awful, because it needs to be. Fortunately that doesn't mean I have to like it. Or even play it...

HOLY CHITS Batman! Here we have AT pretty much at its best, TONS of very cool theme, lots of great detail, unique characters, tons of bits, tons of variety, lots of flavoured text and FUN!

Probably the best co-op boardgame game I have played albeit I'm not really a fan of the genre which is strange as I love D & D. Here acting together can be quite important to beating the system as you need to act efficiently together to try and keep things in check or the game could 'get away' on you. Very neat system overall but definitely long and somewhat fiddly, almost too detailed but I usually love that. 

For a game with so much going for it still something was missing for me in the game and I haven't placed it yet, maybe strategy or lack of as you really just explore until things happen and then act on them, also upgradable characters would have been nice as well.

Bad experience in first play. Rules teacher wasn't prepared and really it was our first boardgame in a long long time so its not quite fair to pin the blame entirely on him since it's difficult to teach this game.

RATING: 4.5
There are very few actual decisions to be made, but reading the cards and imagining what happens to everyone is moderately fun. I've heard though that people play this as a serious storytelling game and really get into the roleplaying, which makes up for the fact that there's really no game. Personally I don't really see any opportunities to roleplay that wouldn't be extremely frustrating and counterproductive for everyone else.

RATING: 7
Too many rules to learn. I had studied the rulebook & watched tutorials online & still had to reference the rulebook constantly. I don't have the time this takes to play either. I'm sure if I knew an Arkham Horror fanatic  that could lead a play through would make it so much more fun.

RATING: 6
I'm a big fan of cooperative games, and I'm a fan of Lovecraft as well.  It's kind of a shame that I don't like this game more.  Oddly, it's the atmosphere that falls flat for me - I don't find it particularly evocative.  The trips through the outer planes always seem so perfunctory, and the fights against the monsters seem more like just straight up brawls instead of the horrific combat I'd imagine.  It's also on the long side.  I do like it and I'm willing to play it, but it could have been so much more.

Okay, I've tried playing this game two or three times and I just don't think it's fun... at all. It's a hassle to set up and I'll probably just lose, or get confused which isn't very often in a game.

I just don't see how all the mechanics they put into this game play together. To me, the game just has a lot of unnecessary fat. If I wanted some fun Cthulu game, I would rather play Mansions of Madness or Elder Sign, both vastly superior games. I'd love to play Eldritch Horror to see how the games differ.

Over-long. Overly complex. I never felt emotionally invested in my character or the scenario. Boring. I don't like Eldritch Horror either, so I guess this type of game just isn't for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
A better co-op game than Lord of the Rings, Shadows over Camelot, or Vanished Planet. That's because you don't feel as if you're playing co-op, you're doing your own thing by doing your part to slow down the coming onslaught and bulk up before fighting the Ancient one. Very entertaining. There is a lot of dice rolling and a good deal of luck is involved, nor is there any great strategizing going on. But it's a fun game and that's the whole point. The major downside of the game is the length, I got my group to play this once but they were very turned off by the amount of time it took to understand the rules and to finish the game. 

**UPDATE** It's been a full year since we first/last played this game but no one in the core group is willing to try this game again so I'm trading it away. (07-2007)

**UPDATE** Ok, I couldn't live without the game, I really wanted it back and I traded for it. Now if I can only get the guys to play it again. (12-2007)

**UPDATE** I can't get anyone to play this game, even I haven't been very enthusiastic to play it again, soooooo....I sold it. (06-2008)

**UPDATE** This game is driving me to madness!!!  I got this again in a trade at Origins.  I'll play it solo if I have to but it will be played!!  (08-2011)

**UPDATE** Nope, it still hasn't happened, neither with gamers or solo.  I'm losing heart. (06-2014)

RATING: 7
Satisfying if you like your Cthulhu Mythos (which I do). Nice narrative feel. Compared to more recent co-op games it feels a little bit rule-heavy and takes an age to set up. I love the artwork and what comes in the box. I have  a real soft spot for the game but you really need to devote proper time to a session and ideally with at least 3 or 4 players to make it really fun. It's OK with one or two but definitely works better if there are more of you.

RATING: 7
Scratches the cooperative problem-solving itch usually filled by pen-and-paper RPGs, and does it without the grueling planning, writing, graphing and thinking. I'm not a fan of the complexity-to-fun ratio; there are so many corner-case rules situations and parts to keep track of, yet the actual mechanical complexity of the game is slight. All the same, it's one of my preferred ways to spend an afternoon (often into the evening and night).

First Citizen of Arkham! Actually, I played my first full game by myself, but using 3 characters: Bob Jenkin the Salesman, Vincent Lee the Doctor, and Mandy Thompson the Researcher. Nyarlathotep was the Ancient One, but we put him to bed without a fight, sealing 6 gates with only 5 tokens on the Doom Track. Bob Jenkins was the tank, sealing 4 gates, becoming Deputy of Arkham, and First Citizen! Mandy's ability to re-roll on failed skill checks once per turn was invaluable. Doc Lee was nonexistent for me, despite his ability to restore 1 stamina once per turn. He never pulled good cards and almost always failed crucial skill checks. I'll give him another chance later. Overall it was a great first run with the game, and I can't wait to play again!

Played only once, but the experience was flat. I'll chalk it up to both of us being new players (having to consult the rules a lot), playing two characters each (lots to keep track of) and not being familiar with the village. We "won"; but then realized Yig starts everyone out as cursed. Ooops. No win.The die rolls were tense. This seems like it could be fun with people who like the genre and if everyone was in the right mood.

One of my absolutely favorite games!  Dripping with a horror theme combined with fun cooperative play.  I schedule a game at my house every other month and it always fills up immediately.  We play with eight players and all the expansions for maximum insanity.  Leaves a certain amount of downtime but everyone is helping everyone and also just chatting and socializing.  Games tend to go down to the wire, one way or the other, so riveting.  I suspect that with experience we'll need to start upping the difficulty level a bit but for now basic level is plenty tough.  Always want another shot at it.  Lots of variety in the cards and events, exploration, building up your character, racing doom, randomness to keep things interesting and varied but enough strategy to keep it mentally engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic production value.  I've never read Lovecraft, but was still completely engrossed by the theme.

Great for solo play.  I love the dynamic where the players chip away at the bad guy, make steady progress during their turn, then get torched at the end of the turn by the Mythos draw.  It just feels right - the small victories are all meaningful, and the kidney shots really hurt . . .

Rules are a little fiddly on the first reading, but once you get the system down, it's easy as pie.  Now I only make occasional trips to the rulebook/FAQ for weird questions (like "can I get arrested while in an Other World?").  If you're not put off by the rules in Power Grid (or Silent War for you wargamers), get your hands on a copy of this gem.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Almost a requirement to own for any board game enthusiast.  Arkham Horror is a fantastic introduction into the deep end of the hobby.  Fully cooperative, lots of random elements for high replay value, and a huge number of expansions to choose from if you want to add even more variety to the experience.

The downside: It can take a very long time to set up (45-60 minutes), it has a lot of rules that aren't easy to remember off the top of your head unless you have played the game several times (and probably read the whopping 30 page rule book at least twice).

Lastly, playing the game with too many expansions causes the overall experience to suffer.  The games own mechanics end up fighting with each other for relevance due to significant deck dilution.

This game is made of awesome. Tons of bits, super sweet theme, and awesome co-op experience. Honestly, if you are geting tired of maximizing influence and other Euro nonsense, get a copy of this, read the rules for three days and start shooting Mi-Gos. 

The rules are a bit OPAQUE. Please avail yourself of Mr. Skeletor's awesome flowchart to avoid going berserk. Of the expansions, the most important is Dunwich Horror--the Injury and Madness cards add a lot of value and decision-making. Just typing this up makes me want to play. Sigh.

This is an "experience" game.  If you start with that mindset, and play with others who enjoy a good experience game, it's a lot of fun.  Bumped my rating from 7 to 8 after numerous plays.  I find that I'm almost always up for a game when someone suggests it.  If I have one complaint, it's that I don't enjoy the endgame dicefest of fighting the GOOs.  It seems like a letdown after all the atmosphere of the main game.

Update:  Bumped to a 9.  I love the story this game tells.  I really enjoy these kinds of "experience" games.

Update (Winter 2013):  Love, love, love this game.  It's fantastic solitaire, which is how I play it mostly now.  It's awesome, flaws and all.

This game is not for everyone. It's long, complex, and sometimes hard to keep track of everything that is going on. That said, I love this game! I like the co-operative style of play as opposed to pitting the players against each other. It makes for a good game night game, as long as that night is really long. It did take a few dry runs through to get the rules down and even then I still have trouble with a few of them. My only complaint with the game is the rule book. It can be a little hard to find a specific rule you are looking for.

One of my favorite games of all time. (Later edit: This is changed. I still love Arkham, but would no longer call it one of my favorites of all time.) The time element, as well as the intimidation for new players keeps it from a ten. I often play solo over the course of a few days (set it up on the table and just do 1 turn when I have time each day). For a hardcore gamer, I find this game a must. 

I should note that new players need to be introduced with ONLY the base game. None of this "all expansions for new players" bullcrap.

RATING: 6
I liked this game, but I have to dock it at least one point for the following flaws: 
1) Random lose a turn mechanism, in a game with 20-30 minute turns this sucks 
2) A separate move and then later encounter mechanism, which adds substantially to the length of the game.
3) A separate Arkham/Other world move/encoutner. These 4 phases could have been combined into 1 phase without substantially altering the game and made the game much shorter.

However, the theme/flavor of the game is top notch.

Good lord, could this game be any less interesting? Move around, draw some cards, roll some dice. There's not much interaction between the players other than "you go here, I'll go there". It feels like everyone is playing their own game, which is a death knell for coops. I honestly don't get the appeal of this one.

RATING: 7.5
If you're new to the game, don't play with fewer than 4 investigators. Even if you have 2 players, play 2 investigators each. With only 2 investigators you're going to get demolished.

This game is not fundamentally difficult to learn or play, but it is extremely complex and intricate, and the rule book is a terrible reference (decent tutorial, though), which unfortunately you'll need to refer to during the game. If you're unsure if you'll like this kind of game, start with Pandemic for a much simpler game with a very similar mechanism (but with a much different theme).

By complex I mean that there is a lot going on and there is a lot you must remember during each turn: Does your investigator have a skill for that? How about a spell? Is there an environment in play that affects spell casting? Do you have a blessing or a curse? Because that affects your roll. Don't forget to add a doom token when a gate opens. Or remove monsters in play when a gate closes. And you have to move the monsters. And at the end of the round don't forget to take money for your retainer, but then roll a die to see if you get to keep the retainer. And the blessing.

Cripe.

Totally worth it, though.

Oh, and dice. Lots of dice. The more powerful your character becomes, the more dice you roll.

This game goes on about 1 or 2 hours longer than it should. There are many decisions to make, but few that affect your long-term strategy.

Needs a big table.

The first two times I played it, the game lasted 5 hours.  Too many newbies, I think.  It didn't help that the first game advertised as a 2 hour game.  However, in the third game, I actually enjoyed it all the way through.  That was also the first time I played with the first two expansions, but I don't really think that made a difference in my experience.  It was still too long, but the time didn't really drag as it did the first two times (despite two newbies).  I would still like to play it with a table full of experienced players to see how it would go.  Based on my third play, I've upgraded it from a 4 to a 5.  Update: The current fad at CABS (amongst Arkham Horror players) seems to be playing with *all* the expansions in games that last an insane length of time.  They have fun, but I don't think I generally would.

Incredible visuals and theme. Fun cooperative gameplay but too long and unbalanced. I like it overall. I'll try to play faster.

***UPDATE***
Wow, this game is easy. I have played at least 15 games, and lost only one. Against Yog-Sothoth, the only slighly dangerous baddie.

***UPDATE***
I find this game boring now, but see my comments on Dunwich Horror.

***UPDATE***
This is the game (I still play) with the single most house rules I use. Some of them minor, some of them change the game drastically. What I love about this game is how much of a "toolbox" it is, and since it's so random and unbalanced anyway, it's borderline impossible to "break" the game in the usual sense, so all aspects of the game are open season for me. Still, you can't avoid that this is a heavy game, with lots of fiddly bits, and that the Mythos phase will never be fun.

Always have been a fan of Call of Cthulhu, and Arkham Horror doesn't disappoint. Our group thrives together on each victory against a monster, particularly the ones we expect might send us to St Mary's, and we feel dismay together at the bigger hardships. It's not roleplaying, but it's the next best thing when you can't get a fixed party to roleplay with.

Did I mention I haven't read the rules closely enough to know if Azathoth was supposed to appear when the terror level reached 10?  The Doom track was only up to 4 when we finished closing all the gates.  Each of us drew Find gate spells at the beginning and had plenty of sanity.  It was great fun, and ran about 2.5 hours.

Arkham Horror's greatest flaw is that it's too long for how much strategy you actually put into the game.

There are too many mechanics that don't matter that serve to make turns take forever, and the correct move is very obvious. So you end up spending 5 hours on a game that, mentally, should take 20 minutes.

Initial Rating 5.0 (May 2010)

The first time I played Arkham Horror was awful, we were 7 players and no one really understood the rules so my game group was very disappointed in the game. The theme is very important to me in a game and I LOVE the Cthulhu mythos so I gave it another chance and now the game is growing on me. I see it has a lot of potential. When I play the game I feel the tension of trying to stop the ancient one and that’s a lot of fun for me, also the game has a high replay value. On the bad side the game can take a long time to finish (although I enjoy lengthy games if the game delivers and this one does), it demands a lot of attention from the gamers because it has so many conditions that modify the game and the rules could be a lot clearer. I know this game is not for everybody, if you played RPGs in your life I think you would enjoy the game but I definitely recommend that you play it before you buy it.

Arkham Horror is now (and has been for a while) in my top ten list of favorite games. I love it, it has so many cards that every experience is radically different than the previous ones. My main complaint with the base game is that I feel (and I know plenty of people disagree with me) the difficulty of the game is too easy. I fixed it by adding expansions. 

Another issue that can be bothersome is the downtime when you are delayed, other than that the game is pure gold for me.

I still love Arkham Horror and I plan to buy all the expansions in the near future, however I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with  BGG´s recommendation system. To me, AH is a very good game that I want to play often but (sadly) most people in my game group don’t like it as much.

I continue to love Arkham Horror. I still haven’t played with all the expansions, but I bought them all a long time ago :D. My desire to play it remains very high and I consider it a better game than Eldritch Horror.

As I own everything for the game, I decided to always play with all monster tokens (separate them after each play was a hassle), with the injuries from Dunwich Horror, with the personal stories from Innsmouth Horror, all investigators, all ancient ones and with a big and a small expansion (using the visiting variant). I don’t wish to mix all the expansions together because it would dilute them and it would be hell to setup and keep up with fulfil all the rules. Also, I will always play with the content from Miskatonic Horror that is relevant for the current game.

Not really a boardgame.  Not really a RPG.  But somewhere in the middle, there is a very fun game.  Its a game that rewards strategy but ultimately, its a luckfest... and thats okay.  Its an experience game that creates an interesting story if played in the right spirit.  Keep the number of players down or it drags too much to be worth it.

It's all fun and games until everyone gets eaten.

One of the better coops, very thematic and immersive.  Slight drawbacks:  can seem a little too formulaic if everyone knows too well what they're doing.  As has been mentioned elsewhere, Elder Signs are too powerful for experienced players as is.  Our standard is now to play with two in the deck, and even that seems unbalanced toward the investigators.

The game does tend to drag on a little and with more than 4 the downtime is just unacceptable.  2 players, 2 heroes each is a lot of fun though.  It's standing up to repeated plays more than I thought possible, though after 10 plays I'm getting bored with base Arkham.  Still, that's about 30 hours of gameplay, and there are expansions to be experienced too.

I enjoy this game but the time can be prohibitive. Additionally, it's a challenge to teach to new players and can be off-putting for new players. However, its challenges do not change the fact that it's a beautifully designed game that genuninely draws you into the mythology and story. It may take a while to learn but it's worth it once you get there.

**Not sure I'd play with 8, but for 4-5, it's fun**

Damn cool. :)

I'm a fairly big Lovecraft Mythos fan. Lovecraft, Robert W. Chandler's "the King in Yellow" Mythos which helped in building a path/crossover audience for Lovecraft (heck, the king in yellow is in the game!), and Tolkien...anyone who creates such a felt world is fun to me. 

Is the game be any good? I think it is. 

It is much more involved if you're not used to these larger 'American' styled games, but you can handle it once you get it going and if you learn it from people who play it, it's a snap to pick up. 

It's a good co-op game, has good art, it's playable, I have fun with it, and it has a great theme for me. It can also be played solo which is a huge plus for sick days.

The production and the bits are great, but a bit dark to view across the table (note: this is NOT true with the second edition as the board art has been modified). Overall though, the look is outstanding and the range of characters is wonderful and well varied in abilities.

After many plays, I personally find the events at locations become repetative, so I'm really looking forward to the new event cards and expansions to give the game more legs than it already has. 

This is not a beast for everyone, but it's a fine RPGish game that you play together and work together in beating. 

It feels Lovecraftian to me (in so much as a boardgame can evoke such feel).

I'd also say, don't play with 8 as the game ground down (we were all good players with it) and we spent a lot of time just waiting for the last 2 gates needed to open in the few spots it could. While it was slow at the end, I still had a very good time. 

It seems to work best with 1-5 players in my mind, but it was nice to have 8 able to play.

RATING: 8
Arkham Horror is a fun game that can take too long to complete (or die). In the game, you play investigators who go about town trying to end the rise of the Great Old One (i.e. Cthulhu, Yig, Azathoth, etc.). The game is played using a rather simple move-action-die-horribly-oh-no-why-not-again-please-cthulhu-spare-me-mercy-help system that uses a bunch of dice as its resolution mechanic. Fighting a wight? Roll dice equal to your fight skill+weapon+spell(if any)+other bonuses. 5 & 6 are successes, unless you are blessed (4,5 & 6) or cursed (6 only). Meet the required number of successes, and you succeed. Repeat until GOO is repealed, or you die.

My opinion on Arkham Horror leans toward the positive. One thing that I like is that the game provides the opportunity for narrative (albeit random narrative), i.e. The Professor was kicked out of the library for simply being there, then taken to a nearby mental institution, who found him to be completely sane and instead sent him to the hospital where a doctor hit him on the head, resulting in him being sent to another dimension and eaten by a ghoul.

The game is random, but in a fun way. 

However, Eldritch Horror may be better.

The game is fun when the group remains concentrated on the game and the theme but if they side track it kind looses its charm. I have played arkham about 5 times alone and i gotta admit it was fun now i wouldnt play it alone often it is still an option for some and very doable.
That being said find the right group and your set for a great time. Have a group that doesnt mind to sit for 4hours and wont complain (god people that complain ruin the game for everyone) Now the difficulty of finding this group is where this game looses its marks. I will probably play it during the holidays and may up the score a bit its been a while since ive played.

I love cooperative RPG-like games, and this is one of the best.  You actually feel like you are doing something on your turn and that you are contributing to the overall victory.  Great theme, lots of cool items, spells, creatures, etc.  It is a little long at first, but it plays faster once everyone is real comfortable with the rules.  Don't play it without a firm grasp of the rules first.  Make sure you look over the board and the various locations before playing also - it helps to know where to go to get blessed, allies, healing, spells, etc.

This game oozes of theme and is visually amazing.  That said this is a game that I would like to see hit a couple of times a year.  Maybe break it out for halloween...setup takes awhile and actual game length is not for the faint of heart.  A few folks in my group own this one so I don't have a strong urge to own it myself.  

For those looking for a heavy themed co-op I strongly recommend this game...for the Euro enthusiats and ultra competitive types I'd look else where.

After a few plays, I find this an enjoyable game, at least with the right people. The need to min-max the characters' actions are often in stark contradiction to any role-playing elements some people may wish to incorporate; in this way, I find House on the Hill more enjoyable. Maybe the biggest letdown of this game (for me) was that the characters cannot really cooperate in beating monsters or closing gates, but need to resolve these actions all by their lonesome. For the enjoyability, variability and production quality, I find this a stable '7'.

Not sure you can beat the artwork and application of theme, but like almost all cooperative games, it feels too much like the game is playing you.  You have limited and fairly straightforward decisions on a turn, dictated entirely by the random event cards.  Add to this that the entire group shares plans and information freely, and this is just a four-hour collaborative puzzle.  Fun once in a very long while, but I think I may give my copy to a friend.

Update:  gave my copy to a friend.

Rating going off one solo play after finally forcing myself to make the time (and space) to play a full game prior to only trialing a few rounds a long time ago.

I thoroughly enjoyable game that draws you in and has lots of tension.  Game does get a little bogged down with all the maintenance that goes on each round but this should hopefully be reduced as I'm still learning all the rules and was only playing solo with three characters.  I certainly won't turn down an offer of a game if I have an afternoon/evening free.

Has been and as of this post still is my favorite game. Oozes with theme as long as players read the cards aloud and the others players listen. Plenty of decision making mixed with direct conflict and some daring and desperate dice rolling. The only reason it is not a perfect 10 for me is that set up and break down are tedious. The only reasons to not like this game are that you A) don't like Co-op games or B) can't read.

RATING: 6
Tried the game twice now, once with 4, once with 2.  Both times it seems as though we were "missing something" in the rules as it seems the monsters keep piling up, and every attempt to defeat them is thwarted, let alone trying to close a gate.  I think I need to play this with someone who is more familiar with it so I can know for sure if this game is for me or not (originally I hoped a horror-themed co-op game would go over well with my wife as she loves BaHOH).

-Update. This game is just hard, which makes sense given the source material.  It does feel a little scripted in so far as you better get someone trying to close a gate every X rounds or else you'll fall behind and lose. The items just seem under powered and monsters too strong overall. Interesting game, but I think I'd prefer something a little more stream lined.

This is a great game, but i wish they made the instruction manual a little more logical. We don't get time to play this as much as i would like, meaning that each time we play, we have to refer to the manual frequently to remind us of the rules. And we often find we are struggling to find the info we need.

There are plenty of other resources as a quick cheat sheet as such, but it would be nice to have the rules in a bit more of a logical order.

So, so very fiddly, strongly dependent on luck of card/chit draw with excessive tabletop and playtime needs.  Doesn't matter - co-op theme is off the charts strong (predisposed as I am to Lovecraft shenannigans), and most successful RPG-grafted-to-board-game in my collection.  Emergent story-telling translates to peerless player engagement.  By wisely decoupling math from the die roll (math tells you # of die, not pip-math), the mechanics distill combat rolls, spell casting and saves to tight, tense dice fests.  Somehow even losing is fun.

Arkham Horror's feeling of immersion outweighs any of its shortcomings. My major complaint with Arkham horror is that it often feels too easy. The Innsmouth Horror expansion makes the game significantly more difficult, and is therefore highly recommended.

RATING: 8
This is a really good "experience" game dripping with a cool theme. However, it's certainly not for beginners since the rules are likely to be a barrier although, once you get into the swing of things, it's pretty straightforward. Also, I'm not too sure about the long-tern strategy here.  It feels more as though you're getting swept up in a story rather than having to make meaty strategic decisions. Still it's good at what it does (sort of an RPG-lite).

Eager to try Eldritch Horror. But till I do: More parts than a space shuttle, half atmosphere and fluff, not really much underneath--and a great game! The psychology of cooperation and the wonderful texture and replayability make this game better than it has a right to be.  Yes, it's fiddly and takes awhile to set up, and you have pile after pile of different cards for seven types of items and various encounters, and endless "dice checks" for fear, fight, evade, luck, spells, luck (everything but taking a crap). But--and this is what critics forget--those are the very things that give the game so much atmosphere.  I love how there are so many layers of overlaying variation (investigators, encounters, GOOs, weather, headlines, rumors) that make each game unique. Stripped down games like Ghost Stories (which reminds me of AH) or Pandemic are perhaps better designs, but don't generate a narrative like this.  (Given its three or four hour play-time, it better!)  While GS or P are closer to the "puzzle" end of the cooperative spectrum, AH sits a bit more to "story telling" side. On first glance AH fools you into thinking it's just a "pick up items to put out fires" game; but while it does involve efficiency puzzles, it only succeeds if you're willing to go into the drama.

I love Call of Cthulhu, so I couldn't help but like this game.  It is very "fiddley" though.. with so many things to keep track of that it detracts from the fun.  I will be buying the Innsmouth Expansion, though... Father Dagon tells me that it must be so.

Essentially a boardgame version of the Cthulhu RPG in some ways... minus the imagination of player invented scenarios. Best with four people, once you sort out the rules and get the turn order down, this lends itself to some hectic, manic play as you rush to close the gates.

RATING: 2
This is a game I REALLY wanted to like because of my interest in the Cthulhoid genre, my appreciation of FFG's top notch production values, and the game's longstanding high reputation. I ended up hugely disappointed though.

I just can't believe that a pre-programmed solitaire system can ever be as devious and malign as your fellow player(s), so I found the gameplay a plodding matter of simplistic optimisation and dice rolling, while the theme was too abstractly represented to engage my imagination any more than the gameplay. A dud. :snore:

To be fair to my rating of this game, we played it being taught by someone that didn't know the rules well. The game got caught in a loop and nothing happened for several turns and then we all got bored, it was late and the store we were playing at was closing up. I was glad when it was over and didn't see enough in the game to ever want me to play it again. I don't understand why this is so widely loved.

This is a great game for fans of Lovecraft, but is also enjoyable for those who haven't read his stories. The first few games are very slow and confusing as you learn the rules, but once you have a handle on the rules it plays very smoothly. There are plenty of difficult choices and unexpected challenges (I hate rumours!!) and there is a lot of teamwork necessary to win the game. If I have the spare 3 or 4 hours necessary to complete a game, I won't turn down a play.

Very cool.  Lots of options for the players.  Dripping with theme (a plus).  Lots of fun.

Not really the world's cleverest mechanics.  Lots of luck & randomness.  But they work really well with the game.

The game works (I think) because it always comes down to close decisions.  Perhaps its because I suck at it, but there is tension, decisions, and an inability to know if you did the right thing.

Mildly enjoyed my first play. It was an 8P game, so pretty long and chaotic. The Dunwich Horror, Kingsport Horror, and King in Yellow expansions were all in play. 

I didn't bother reading the rules beforehand, I just dove right in and took pointers as I went from the experienced players there. The cooperative nature of the game makes this an easy (and recommended) way of getting the hang of it all. 

The theme is obviously linked inextricably to the play, and the production value is very, very good--to be expected from FFG. The sheer volume of cards and components is overwhelming. I enjoyed the suspense of all the card and monster drawing, but was a little underwhelmed by the combat. Maybe it was the items I had, but beating the monsters seemed too easy, and the effects of running out of sanity too mild. In the end, we destroyed the Great Old One without a single person ever getting very close to dying. 

I'd play again, probably with fewer players next time to speed things up. A good game overall--not one I would buy, and there's no chance of it becoming my favorite, but fine as an occasional group game. I had no prior knowledge of Lovecraft's work, and I take it that being familiar with the mythos helps to enjoy the game.

Fantastic game idea with a wonderful theme.  The game is a little unbalanced (OK, maybe more than a little!), but the core of the game is so cool, that fans of the game have devised all sorts of variants to make things more interesting.  The game takes way too long to play, but it is still amazing.  I would give it a perfect 10 if someone could devise a balanced variant that could be played in less than 2 hours!  Warning - this is NOT a Euro-style Game!

2015 update - game sold as I had no time to play and appreciate it. Will maybe replaced in the future by Eldritch Horror? Or any subsequent game, if any comes out?

This game is very involved, drips with theme, and has plenty of tension. However, it is also insanely long and isn't easy to teach or re-learn between sessions. I appreciate it far more than I enjoy it. Would rather play Eldritch Horror.

The best known and most popular co-op game. I'm not a big fan of horror in general but I do like H P Lovecraft. The guy was clearly completely crazy, but he created an incredible world, which this game allows you to experience in a very unique way. 

To get the most out of this game you really need to play it a bit like a RPG and craft a story as you play. I think it's quite a good game in it's own right, but if you can really imerse yourself in it, it becomes something very special. 

The only frustrating thing is that it does show me what a great game Tales of the Arabian Nights would be if only it was more of a game.

Hmmm.  Arkham Horror represents the worst of Fantasy Flight Games.  Too long, too many bits, chits, cards, rules etc etc.  This is going to sound strange, but I actually think that the theme is pasted on here.  The *mechanics* of the game are not consistent with the theme.  Yes, there are a whole bunch of cards and bits with writing on them which fall within a theme but the theme is not inherent in the game.  As a counter-example, consider Incan Gold.  This is a push-your-luck game set in the theme of a treasure hunt - the game mechanics work with the graphics to create the thematic experience.  I just don't get that feeling playing Arkham Horror:  I feel like I am pushing a piece around aboard doing stuff which, oh yeah, apparently relates to some story.  Put it another way - playing the game did not make me care one bit about the story.  Saying that the theme should come out of the imagination of the players is just an excuse for lazy game design.  I think that this is why I dislike role playing board games in general.

The expansions, while they can add component overload, are great.  I have no problem collecting the expansions because I know they will hit the table!

RATING: 6
Long and elaborate cooperative game. Immersive atmosphere undercut by mechanics. [b][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/171469]See my review[/url][/b]

I gave AH another try 2 years after my review. It's a fragile game. You'll have the easiest time getting it to work as a 2-player experience, with each player taking charge of two characters. Other than soloing the game (not really my thing), that's the only viable path to experienced play. Trying to become familiar with the game in a multiplayer environment is a nightmare of tedium. Once you [b]are[/b] an experienced player, I think this could work quite well with three. I question whether or not it could work with more than that. Too much downtime and too little participation. 

My biggest criticism of Arkham Horror is that it is essentially a simple resource management game. You need clues and money. Lots of amusing events crop up in pursuit of clues and money, but as far as tough decisions go, simple risk management constitutes 90% of your choices. Once an encounter begins, there is virtually no room for strategy and response. Once you know that, it can still be an entertaining game. You make your choices about clues and money and then watch the AH Sci-fi sitcom. 

There's not much out there to compete with AH. Tales of the Arabian Nights is certainly a better game, but Tales does away with resource management entirely in favor or pure narrative generation. I want a game that generates narrative and allows me to make meaningful decisions [b]during[/b] the events of that narrative. I don't think that game exists, outside of RPGs, and my limited experience suggests those don't do it that well either.  

As a two-player game, I rate Arkham Horror an 7, but it bothers me that the rating seems so contingent on a lack of alternatives. As a 4+ player game I rate it a 4 or 5. I just tried it again with three and four, and there just isn't enough for me to do. With four players you inevitably start taking your turns simultaneously and screwing up the sequence.

This rating might go up if I understood everything about the game but it is such an effort to figure everything out that we can't seem to finish the game. We give it try a month later (having overcome our frustration, but also forgetting most of what we learned about the rules) and go through the whole learning curve/frustration again. Sigh.

RATING: 5
Interesting game that somewhat evokes the Cthuhlu 'feel', but it could do so in half the time (i.e. 90-120 mins vs. the 3-4 hrs for 7 players). Also the final battle with the boss felt a bit anti-climactic, essentially devolved into a huge dicefest where what you did for the past 3-4 hrs didn't make a difference (e.g. you lost most of your items anyway, etc.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The solo play was definitely useful for learning the rules, and I did get into it after awhile (though I was looking forward to the end after about 4.5 hours). Looking forward to playing this with others, though I'm not sure I'll have too many takers.

RATING: 7.5
The greatest part about this game is that its an adventure. Not much skill involved, mostly dice based but going around finding out information and battling horrible creatures is a great time!!  The theme is decent, and the suspension raises as the GOO gets closer to awakening. The last battle is a great add on to the end game suspence.  All in all a great game for someone who is lookin for a nicely themed adventure.

Skip this and just go straight to Eldritch Horror, which is obviously the better-designed, more enjoyably, more thematic, and more stream-lined Lovecraft game. If you play Eldritch Horror, you will never want to go back to Arkham Horror.

I never really liked Arkham but tried to get into it because I enjoy the Lovecraft universe. It is only after 10 games or so when I realized that it is really not a well-designed game. The game is nearly pure randomness, there's no safe way to improve your chances in the random encounters, everything takes way too long to do with little real enjoyability, and the game can drag on for hours after it is clear your team has lost.

Nice co-op. I prefer Eldritch Horror slighlty over this one as it's a little more streamlined. One issue with Arkham Horror is the small differences between the different ancient ones. Another is that you just can follow the same path for victory every time.

RATING: 6
There is an easy game underneath a whole bunch of rules.  I like the co-op nature but there are games that are easier to parse through the text and get to the core gameplay.  The only real way to learn this is to have someone else explain it to you or get ready for a lot of time fighting to understand what to do.  That being said, it's a decent co-op game that really captures its theme well if you have someone who knows the rules (otherwise you keep getting yanked out of the game in order to look up information).

Excellent Co operative game of skill checks and oodles of theme. Fun with the right group (and played fast enough). A slow group or somone not willing to just go with it can kill this game dead.

One of the few games that my wife will play so it gets loads of points for that. But actually a very good game indeed. It's really good to be able to strive for something and know that nobody is going to stab you in the back or is waiting to put you down a peg or two on your first mistake. But this game doesn't need any such behaviour from the players, the game mechanics do it quite well enough. To be honest, as a family, we are not used to winning this game. I am pretty sure we have lost every game so far. But at least we can all commiserate with each other.

I have played a couple of games on my own as well and have won - but only when there were four characters in play. Four seems the perfect number. With three there are not enough of you to mop up all the monsters and with 5 or 6, there are just too many monsters popping out of those portals. Also, with too many characters, there aren't enough easily available clues to go around making it hard to get the requisite 5 clues to seal the portals.

That said, an excellent game.

An awesome co-op game for H.P. Lovecraft fanatics (for which I am one!) & one of the sessions I played was solitare (I lost).  I really like this game a lot & I'm sure my rating will go up when I play with others who are familiar with Lovecraft as much as I am.  The groups I played with hadn't a clue about H.P., which made for less colorful table-talk.

Artwork and theme really set this one apart.  Loses points for being a little too long for what it is and having decisions that are too often terribly obvious.  Plays well solo.  

Update:  Among my favorite solo games.  Once you get to where you aren't looking at the rulebook, you can crank this out quickly and really get immersed in the theme and your characters.

Good game that just never sees the table unless I'm feeling nostalgic--and even then, it's hard to get my friends to play. Eldritch is probably the better game and Elder Sign is a fair bit quicker. Still, this is a great memory-maker as it throws off-the-wall scenarios at you and it remains a great game.

Arkham Horror is a game that I have known for a long time, and it always intrigued me, but also seemed a bit intimidating because of its long playing-time and huge amount of bits. Fortunately I bought and tried it, and I think it's very cool. It might be my favorite cooperative game that doesn't include a traitor. The adventurous experience and fantastic theme make this game for me. The game's mechanics are chuncky and need some getting used to; also, there's a lot of bookkeeping to be done. The quality of the experience is almost fully dependent on the people you play with, especially since this is a horror-themed adventure game, so you have to get into the 'zone' (read this review to know what I mean: http://bit.ly/b3uHSJ). I've had a couple of disappointing plays, because of players that lost interest while playing. This game plays extremely well in solo mode. The biggest flaw in the game is the highly variable playtime. I think 2 hours would be fine for this game, but sometimes it can drag on for 4+ hours, way too long for this game.

RATING: 6.5
Drips with atmosphere. I really wasn't sure my wife would enjoy it (long play time, lots of bits usually don't sit well with her), but she seemed to enjoy it... to a point. A nice way to spend an afternoon with friends. Unfortunately, playing sometimes feels too predictable. As though the end of the game is a foregone conclusion that you're just grinding your way towards. From what I hear, some of the expansions go some way to correct this, making gates re-open, etc.; but we have yet to play with any of them.

Arkham Horror is a big game with lots going on at all times. The components and art and mechanics all work very well. It's beautiful, well produced (FFG) and comes with tons of chrome. And hey, HP Lovecraft!

I love it, but it's not a good game. It takes ages to set up (which can be fun on its own) and to play. I prefer it with a small group or even solo. You have to appreciate the theme and you have to love the ton of cards and markers to have  fun with it. There is a lot of randomness involved and the rules are unnecessarily long and complicated.

This is definately an experience type of game.  I enjoy Lovecrafts work, so I want to like this game.  But it is definately more an RPG with the board as a GM. For this game to be enjoyable, you really need players willing to role-play the game.  The rules are a bit fiddly.  The two times we played we struggled just to play it right.

Update 2012: I dove in again because I really want to like this game and something finally clicked. All the moving parts came together. Bumped my rating up from a 6.

RATING: 7
Clearly devised for the RPG folks, I also enjoyed the atmosphere and pieces. Got played through this game by experienced players the first two games. The sweet spot probably is with three or four players. Six or more is too much as the game flow will suffer when people constantly need to be reminded when it is their turn again. The theme then takes a back seat and the fiddly repetitive mechanisms will come to the fore.

THE game that got me into the board gaming hobby, for few months, my group and I had dedicated our whole Saturday playing this game.

To conclude, Arkham horror is way too clunky for the game it offer. Especially for us (The first modern board game we got into). To list a few of the problems, the amount of rules, different phrases, moving component, different tracks to keep track of, is just way too overwhelming and energy draining.

Another major complain will be the unbalance between risk and reward for encounters, the more you play, the more you will limit yourself, as you WILL eventually find out that a lot of the potential contents in the game is just not worth doing at all (providing that you're actually trying to WIN the game, not EXPEREINCING the journey). 

In short, great experience, bad "game".

This is the most epic game we own.  It takes at least 2 hours to play, minimum.  I don't know what to say about it.  There are an insane number of rules, cards, and pieces.  And that is part of what makes it so much fun.  I love killing monsters.  I love traveling to other dimensions.  I love that Arkham gives me a chance to use get tons of use out of my dice tower.  Most of our games are 2 player, but the few games we've played with 4 or 6 people have been even more fun.  The more people there are the easier it is to get into the story part of the game.

This game is more fun than it looks or felt after one play.  The staggering number of pieces makes it feel overblown and our first session took over 5 hours, but second and subsequent playthroughs have been a blast.  The game needs more location cards in the base set (7 per area is a joke), but once you get a few expansions this problem goes away.  I'm disappointed that later investigators start to make the initial set seem a little weak (Jenny Barnes though is likely to remain my favorite for a long time), but that's a minor quibble.

[b]Quick Review:[/b] The game plays you. No real strategy or tactics, you just sort of do things, and things happen to you. It has a very large random factor. For a game that can last hours, the luck element gets to be frustrating to me. 

However, if you let the game act as a sort of Game Master, and you treat the game as an RPG-lite storytelling game, you'll have more fun. 

Turn off the lights, and set ambient music as you investigate the strangeness happening to the city of Arkham.

Arkham Horror has definitely grown on me after a number of plays.

Perhaps its only because I'm a HUGE H.P. Lovecraft fan, or an equally HUGE FFG fan, but I love this game. My game group and I used to play the original and, although it was good, it was a little clunky. This version cleaned up all the rules and really captured the theme and atmosphere of Lovecraft's work. This, coupled with the artwork and vastness, makes this game exemplary.
Love it.

This is difficult for me to rate properly - hopefully I will have the chance to try it again before I completely forget the rules.  I sense that we might have not played all the rules right, but not having any experienced AH players in the group, the rules are a definite challenge to master. 

I can see why many would enjoy this game.  The theme is evocative, and the artwork is not too bad as far as this mystic/fantasy stuff goes.  I've never really understood or appreciated the whole Cthulu mythos, but I would guess that that would really help one's ability to become immersed in the game.

Even though I'm not the biggest fan of cooperative games, this still felt engaging, and moderately fun, but it is just too long, too rules-heavy and too random.  If every player was familiar with the rules I think the experience would be vastly improved.

Additional Information
Cool characters, cool pieces, and then starting the game turned into a [b]enormous snore-fest[/b]. What clues aren't clues? Reroll? What did I accomplish by killing that zombie? Nothing? 

Advertises as a co-operative game, but it's nothing more than [b]multi-solitare game[/b]. Once one person gets ahead, the others have little use to exist.

The game should really be called: Arkham Horrible.

I have had AH lying around for a couple of years, and finally the stars were in alignment, and I got around to playing...
Great game! RPG elements and cooperation equals great fun, and a lot of variation gives it lots of replay value, there´s LOTS to do and experience... but also a typical FFG expansion game, like eg. Runebound, I´m hooked, and now I´m going hunting for boxes with gazillions of new cards and other, bigger boxes containing neighboring cities and even more cards, counters and new rules... Yeehaaa!

A thematic but overwhelming game where players work together in an attempt to close six portals. Too many rules and too much downtime (played 8 players). Flavor text was well done and it had a nice feel about it. In terms of component-fiddliness, it is pretty much on par with Descent or WoW:tB.

The best boardgame (up to now, I haven't tried yet Mansions of Madness) on the world of Lovecraft. It's true that sometimes, the result may be a little over the top (the shotgun-armed nunn riding her bycicle while killing every monster in sight...), but boy, this is fun! And the brooding sense of despair when things are getting out of control makes of this game a very rewarding experience that can be fulfilled in a single evening.

I bought a slightly damaged copy from Thoughthammer at Christmas a few years back, and I've had a blast with it so far.  Definitely a keeper!  No game plays the same, and it is EXCELLENT as a solo game.  The only downsides are long playtimes, large play areas needed (particularly if you get the expansions!) and rules that take patience to learn (most players need time to get the rules down pat).  Otherwise, I recommend it fully!

A surprisingly strong horror coop offering that makes the most of its cool theme. I had been both doubtful and willing to try this for a long time. It wasn't anywhere as long as I had been expecting and it was fun. Rules editing has been done in a very bad way. The order of things in rules often doesn't make sense and there are gaping holes and basically missing information especially regards to monsters and combat. But going through the rules and starting to play helps make it quite fluid relatively quickly. Color scheme is also very bad, but suits the game and theme.

Only one play at Gamestorm 2012.  I enjoy the theme and especially enjoy the mechanic of having a very diverse set of locations with very diverse actions to take/cards to draw at each.  This would actually be my favorite cooperative game if it weren't for the shear difficulty in beating the ancient one.  It's hard enough to fight off the minions that are constantly showing up but then also to prepare for a huge end monster can seem overwhelming to the point it detracts from the enjoyment.  I still appreciate and enjoy the game despite this but would have liked it a little better if it wasn't that crushing.  The theme appeals to me but doesn't fit with my gaming group and certainly wouldn't play well with newbies/family.

I absolutely love playing this game with 2 or 3 other people.  The rules are clunky and there is a lot to remember with a lot more going on, but it is a very fun and suspenseful game.  The game wants to kill you, and it's challenging, but it's not too hard to overcome.  Rolling dice is the random factor, because some days you just can't roll a success even if you're blessed.  I love that there are support characters, although they may not be the most fun to play.  I try and play most games with either a solo variant, or playing as two people and I found it pretty difficult with this one.

My first "Ameritrash" game was played last weekend, and it was quite an enjoyable experience.  The emphasis on working as a team was a refreshing change of pace, as well as the fact we took the time to focus on the theme throughout the game made for some hilarious moments.

Plus, we crushed our Ancient One by sealing gates, which is always a great way to get addicted to a game. ;)

Way over-rated game in my opinion. Maybe my experience is the rarity, but I spend the vast majority of my time doing nothing just to recover from random stuff happening to me that I can't do anything about. The decisions are few and far between. It's a game you don't play, it plays you.

Rating is probably going to fluctuate, depending on my current "need" to play., somewhere between 7.5-9.

Time will tell if the looong playtime needed is acceptable.  It also helps that my wife actually likes it!
I own all the expansions, and I am sure those will enhance the replayability...especially Dunwich, which seems to have some fantastic additions...injury cards, tasks...

Update 7/7/08 :  I still love this one.  The vast amount of options make it an absolute blast.  The upgrade in difficulty has made it even more interesting (and deadly) and i think this one will last the test of all time...It may even crack top 5 one day...
It just simply eats too much of a game night's time that it's hard to justify playing often.
It's the only reason, really, that it loses points from me.

As compared to A Touch of Evil, which many do, I think it's different overall due to:

1) MUCH higher degree of difficulty
2) MUCH longer playing time
3) Many more options/variations
4) No competitive mode (outside of odd events here & there)

Really captures the feel of the "Cthulhu Mythos". Great writing on the cards, and the beautiful art really set the mood. Components are the cherry on this sweet looking cake... :) Mechanics are easy and fast enough for this type of game. Just to keep the game "in-the-flow". The only problem with just the base game is the low count of the Event-cards. The game can be repetitive with just the base set. Not a problem to us though, as we have the whole collection. Thanks to my friend... Seems that the "Black Goat" expansion brought some more difficulty to the table, and made the game more appealing to me. Now it isn't such of a "walk-in-the-park" anymore, and that's a good thing. Thumbs up.

RATING: 7
I still haven't finished a game of this, but I like what I've seen. The art is genuinely creepy, the rules are simple but innovative, and the roles are surprisingly distinct and their special powers really have an impact on what you can do. It's an atmospheric but social game that works well with a big group, as long as everyone can manage to just be resolute. The danger here, like other multiplayer cooperative games, is that everyone ends up playing every character by committee.

[Update: After three more plays, I really like this, and had to move it up to an 8. The expansions aren't all necessary - I'm particularly unfond of The King In Yellow. The game itself is infinitely replayable, and has a robust enough AI that playing against the system can be genuinely creepy. I still wish the game had enough naked self-interest in it to prevent other players from dictating what I do, but it's a genuine co-op with no traitors, so groupthink is bound to crop up. 

I feel strongly also that players should not have to choose their characters at random - there are some real stinkers in there, and there are enough characters that everyone should be able to find someone they don't mind playing for a few hours. I find the photographer satisfying, the gangster less so. There appears to be a consensus that the researcher's clues give her a commanding advantage, but I don't enjoy tinkering with spells as much since the skill check margins tend to be tighter, and besides, you don't have to spend anything besides time to fire a gun in this game. Don't get me wrong, you need a spellcaster in your group. I'd just prefer it'd be anyone but me.

Some wise friends have ruled that people be prohibited from digging through entire decks as this can take forever, especially when you're playing with three or four expansions. Instead, take the top ten cards and pick one. A not unreasonable fix that should probably be in the rules.]

[Another update: OK, I love this game. While some of the Ancient Ones are WAAAY too difficult (paging Yigg-Tstll...) and there are times when flubbing a die roll or two can lose you the game, I love how much thought has been put into the expansions. 

Which leads to another question: a lot of people seem to think AH would benefit from a "meta-expansion" that would stitch together all the fairly disparate ones published so far, and make them work together. (a) I'm not sure anything could do this, though an errata FAQ would probably come closest and (b) what would they do if they wanted to add ANOTHER expansion afterwards? The flexibility of the Arkham Horror system is one of its great strengths. There are 5!=120 combinations of expansions you can play with so far, and if you can't find a combination that hits your own personal sweet spot as far as theme dilution, etc., you're just not trying very hard.

Arkham Horror reminds me a little bit of that Borges story where the guy makes a map of the world so exact that it ends up matching the world point-for-point, and taking up exactly as much space as the world itself. Except this world has foul squid gods.]

Based on 1 play.  Another addition to the line of Fantasy Flight Games that I want to like but just don't have the patience for.   The first few turns of AH were enjoyable, but the remainder were repetetive and dull.  Towards the end I wanted so badly to close the final gates, not to win but so the experience would be over.  And this was with veteran players who had a strong grasp of the rules.  We ended up calling it quits at the 4.5 hour mark.  The content and strategy of the game can't justify that kind of time-frame.

RATING: 8
Very fun and thematic game play, though I've never played an RPG I think this board game is about as close to one as you can come.  You really do "feel" like you are your character and you are personally struggling against the Mythos.  The game also plays very well solo, but I haven't ever played with more than 3 players.

The mechanics of the game aren't really that fantastic though, and it gets a little too easy once you figure out the "strategy" to it.  I've heard the expansions can help ratchet up the difficulty a lot though.  Fun game for solo play and in the right crowd.

This is an awesome game that is all about theme.  It does a superb job of filling you with a sense of impending doom.  It's very clear from the start that you have little hope of accomplishing all that you would want and so decisions become critical, in some cases razors-edge important.  That dark cloud looming over you coupled with one of the best themes in any game creates a cooperative gaming experience like no other.  Being an FFG game it also means that the components are chrome-tastic.  If you like lots of bits in your games (I sure do) then this game will be one more great box to add to your collection.

RATING: 9.8
This is one beefy, complex game.  I've played Die Macher, but Arkham just feels much more complex because of the massive amount of specific circumstance rules.

I also really love it, partially because I enjoy Lovecraft and partially because it's vast and challenging.

2017 update: Replayed recently, and I still enjoy it. I doubt I'll ever shake the nostalgic ties I have to this game. I think there are many objectively better games, but something about the theme, the rules density, and the fun of the dice will always keep Arkham Horror close to my heart.

Also, hi to anyone reading my bgg comments and laughing at how incongruous this game probably looks among my other top-rated games.

RATING: 9
Terrific fun, really exciting, even solo.  The theme is very immersive.  Rules take a while, but eventually it all flows.  As usual, Universal Head's reference sheets are invaluable.

Score increased to 9 after various improvements:
 - game blinged out with minis (investigators & monsters);
 - game blinged out with litko gate holders & elder signs;
 - I use cardholders so that half the table isn't occupied by 20 decks of cards;
 - added lots of cards added from various expansions;
 - I now use the 2-investigators-act-as-4 variant for solo play (1 upkeep & mythos phase for each 2 movement & encounter phases).
Together, these have substanitally increased my enjoyment.

This was my true gateway into non-standard boardgaming. I love this game! It's a little overwhelming for newer players, but it is a fantastic game overall. Everyone should give this a try. Especially those who enjoy the HPL mythos. 

I feel this game really simulates the challenging nature the "investigators" in the lovecraftian mythos are faced with. It is a hard game, and you`ll likely loose a lot, but it is very fun, and very satisfying when you actually win!

Okay game.  During my plays I was confused and half lost but fortunately we had at least one player who was very familiar with the game.  The end part where players jointly fight the GOO seems a little dumb in that it's just a themeless dice-rolling exercise.  I might be willing to play this again if someone really wanted to but Eldritch Horror (unplayed) and Mansions of Madness (played) have supplanted this game on my radar.

I love Arkham Horror. I love the theme. I love the cooperation. I love losing in grisly fashion when everything seemed to be going so well. 

We play this game in our group when we have the time, and though we win often, it's the horrible losses, when things just really spiral out of control, that are so fun. We prefer 4-6 players for our games.

The expansions can really change the game strategy and difficulty, as well as making it more thematically focused - using all of the King in Yellow mythos cards on top of the mythos deck, for example.

Had high hopes due to theme and cooperation. Was absolutely uninspired and found it repetitive.  It felt like cooperative solitaire.  My co-players were closing gates themselves, but on their own.

Spend 1 hour setting up.

Move, kill monster, go through gate, survive sanity, come back through gate, close gate.  Repeat 6 times.

Spend 1 hour breaking down.

Give me Descent any day.

Nice bits, and a genuinely enjoyable game, mostly. Really starts to drag and drag about 3/4 through sometimes, and for large portions of the game some or all of the players just spin their wheels going nowhere. Yet for all that, it still makes me want to spend a Saturday afternoon at the table.

In the first seven times I played, we succeeded in sealing six gates before the Big Bad appeared. On the 8th play, Yig reared its ugly head, but both players had recently acquired powerful magical weapons, and we too it out. On the 9th play, I rolled awful all game, got devoured just before Hathur came along kicked the snot out of us, including my brand new character. Ouch.

RATING: 7
Initial thoughts: Wow, this really captures some of the atmosphere of the Call of Cthulhu RPG. Has got great production value -- tons of counters, and nice illustrations too (you'll have to squint to make the most of them, though). 

Reassesment after second play: Suffers somewhat from its eighties american game ancestry -- mainly the long playing time, and this time also from a lack of endgame tension. (It was clear that we couldn't lose the game, but also that it would be a long, somewhat mechanical process to close the last gates, mainly due to prominent gate surges at terror level 10. This could be scenario-dependant, though -- we played vs. Hastur.) 

I'm still expecting to enjoy this, perhaps not all too frequently, and in the right company (some roleplaying/mythos knowledge goes a long way here).

Fantastic game-  immersive, challenging and true to the Mythos. Sure it takes longer to set up than Mansions of Madness but AH is the Lovecraftian's choice due to the pure scope that added expansions bring to the table....a few extra board sections and decks see ones imagination soar to previously unreachable Chthonic heights.

The pre-painted Investigator miniatures are a must have- so much easier to tell where you are located in Arkham and they are top notch quality.....if you can track them down.

Recommended big box - Dunwich Horror (madness/injury cards)

Recommended small box - Black Goat of the Woods (Awesomely tough)

Too rules heavy for what is was.  But I tend to feel that cooperative games mostly belong on the easier side of the spectrum.  I'm also not a huge fan of Horror or HP Lovecraft so I suppose I'm not the target demo for any of this anyway.  My rating dropped because at this point I'd really rather avoid this one and try Eldritch Horror instead.

(FFG Edition) A long time in coming this is a revised, revamped and expanded version of the classic Arkham Horror game by Chaosium. At its heart a dungeon crawl, but what a great crawl it is.  As with all things Cthulhu the game is stacked against the players, but that's all part of the attraction, isn't it?    A cooperative game that scales well for 1 - 8 players.
(June 2005) First Printing.   
(November 2006) Revised Printing.

[b]UPDATE:[/b] So why such a low rating? Because despite the great theme I find the game boring. Downtime is a problem in games with more than three or four players. Game is way to "fiddly" with all of the card decks, etc, especially as expansions are added into the mix. Finally the game suffers from the "one player telling everyone else how to play" syndrome that is common to cooperative games.

A sound you hear a lot while playing this: ZzzzZzzz

Once in a while, you have a choice to make, which is obvious or will be dictated by a "better player". Then you read a card, that will inevitably make you roll dice so your choice wasn't very important to begin with. Then you wait again for your turn. My big mistake: I didn't have my Nintendo DS with me, so I had to abuse caffeine.

In more technical term: a dicefest, take ages to move, the theme isn't well done. If you want to do RPG, play a real one, not this mess. Avoid.

RATING: 10
Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game set in 1920's Massachusetts in which a group of investigators are tasked with defeating a Lovecraftian elder god. Investigators make discoveries via encounters (in this world and others), gain equipment, fight monsters, etc. over the course of the game.

Arkham Horror is, by design, unbalanced. If the players choose their investigators and the Ancient One (the elder god you are tasked with fighting) randomly, and if they draw exceptionally powerful monsters into the game, then it can become nearly impossible to win if there isn't a clear path forward. However, this plays into the atmosphere of Lovecraftian Horror exceptionally well; helplessness and feeling overwhelmed are part and parcel with Lovecraft's work. Due to the length of the game, this can be discouraging for players. However, it makes the times when the investigators do manage to overcome the odds all the sweeter, creating a sense of comraderie that I've not seen from any other game I've played. Combined with the Roaring-Twenties-Meets-Science-Fiction aesthetic and this one's a big winner.

This game should be played by anyone who enjoys cooperative gaming experiences, and enjoys a good story; stories often evolve organically, which can be both compelling and oftentimes quite hilarious. If you've got 3 to 4 hours to play, and you stay invested, it's incredibly rewarding.

Always a favorite with my group. We played an all-expansions verion with 8 players about a month and and a half ago (Aug/'08). It took nearly 8 hours. But, though I died, Nyarlathotep could not defeat the players. This one will never get stale.

Minus the length, it's a fantastic thematic game.  Only 1 game under my belt (w/ numerous Elder Sign games there) but I can tell it's a keeper.  The game is REALLY involved (as I played w/ all newbie players, including myself) but it should become more fluid w/ future plays.  Biggest advice is to let everyone the length of the game, as this is a beast of a game w/ MANY things to keep track of.  We did win the 1st game w/ 5 investigators, somewhat comfortably.  Though luck was on our side.

About what I had expected.  An unreal number of chits and tokens, so many different piles of cards, so many minor rules I need to reference the rulebook more than I would like (i.e., never!).

This one does not live up to the hype for me. I like the expansions to death, and they all seem to handle the theme much better than the base game. Conceptually, they all excite me, and I can't seem to stop buying them. However, I think the base game is way too luck-dependent, too fiddly, too long, and terrible for solo play. Still oddly attracted to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
this one is a hard one for me to rate in some regards.  It is a heavy weight game to me in the sense that there is a large amount of nuances that happen every turn, a decent amount of setup, and a decent number of look ups in the rule book through-out play unless I happen to be playing with people that are experienced to share some of the mental load of rules

The theme is great, it does feel like you are trying to prevent Arkham, and the world, from being overrun by an elder one, but it is rules heavy and at this point, unless i'm playing with a group of experienced people at it, I don't really bring it out on the table anymore. 

depending on the group and how much meta gaming you want to do, it is not unreasonable to expect a 90-150 minute game out of this.

I'm a big fan of Lovecraft and quite enjoyed the base game.  Then I got greedy and bought waaay too many of the expansions.  That turned what was already a slightly slow game into a bloated monstrosity resembling the Elder Gods themselves.  How many decks of cards does one game need?    I finally gave up and pulled out all of the expansion cards.  I recommend playing just the base game and/or using one expansion at a time.  I prefer the expansions that just add cards (instead of expanding the board).

Pretty much exactly what you'd expect of a Kevin Wilson game about the Cthulhu mythos.  Do you like those things?  I do.

(It's also much more strategic and less random than it first appears, but you get out of it what you put into it.  It can be perfectly enjoyable when approached like Arabian Nights, but don't do that and then complain about the perceived lack of strategy.)

First play on January 5 was epic, with the investigators ultimately devoured one by one by Ithiqua.  Glad I learned the game and look forward to playing again with a better idea of what is going on.  My character, Mandy Thompson, was a foxy researcher, just like me, with an excellent re-rolling ability.  I experienced some of my worst rolls of all time, including not being able to get two 6s out of 18 rolls.  CURSES!

This was the first "real" board game that I've bought. What a deep and complex experience it was! I felt something new with it, something I've never felt before. A whole movie with cardboard stages and cardboard actors :) I even started reading Howard Lovecraft novels :)

Very nice looking, very atmospheric, very well produced game.

My only complain so far - it is too hard to remember and follow up all the incoming "Wheather" and other special Mythos cards. You're trying to keep in mind the last one, but they keep mixing altogether.

1-8

RATING: 4
Arkham Horror is, basically, like playing a tabletop RPG without requiring someone to act as game master or narrator. A hack & slash role playing session. The game has tons of chrome which, while they do add to the theme, also increase downtime tremendously.

The most important quality of this one is, obviously, the theme: it reigns supreme over all other aspects. Given it is a cooperative game, interaction in between players is high, as you will keep discussing the best moves and so on. The massive amount of cards along, with all the dice you will need to roll, shoots the luck factor quite a bit but, thankfully, the possibility of "customizing" your investigator each turn not only helps dealing with this, but also creates a mechanism which allows you to constantly take interesting tactical decisions.

So what is Arkham Horror about? The town of Arkham is going to be attacked by a godlike creature who wants to destroy the world, and you have to stop that from happening. 

Players will be exploring the town, battling monsters, trying to close the portals they emerge from, all while facing the uncertain (a.k.a.: randomly drawn event cards). If you fail to close all the portals, then the big guy will attack, and a last stance battle will commence.

The of lavish theme, high interaction and luck screams "AMERITRASH!" all the way, and that's what this game is. Though not only it has the best aspects of this genre, also sports its worst qualities: it's as fiddly as it gets. Even though the mechanisms succeed at giving it the RPG vibe, there are an absurdly high number of them, and a decent bunch of them are convoluted and unintuitive.

Its biggest issue, and the primary reason my rating tanks, is downtime: it's a chore to set up, and there's a lot of maintenance to be done in between turns. On an average Arkham Horror session half of the time, if not more, will be spent doing busywork. That's a huge deal-breaker for me.

All in all, if you are looking for something more than narrative when playing a game, skip this one and go for something else. Arkham offers a boardgamey RPG session set in Lovecraftian myths, nothing more, nothing less.

This game is NASTY! My friends and I have played 4-5 times and we've only beat it once! And in spite of that, it is extremely fun.

Update: The last couple of times we've played this, we beat it both times. They were in a 2 player situation both times and we went with a house rule that when you are knocked out or go insane you only lose 1 item or spell instead of half of them. I'm not sure how much of an edge that gave us though. I think we were lucky with the monsters we drew from the cup.

Much is said about this game. So here's my opinion:
One mighty big boardgame I (nearly) always love to play. There are some issues with rules (complexity, you kind of forget some of the "small" details very easily) and their presentation. Some of the expansions should be bought for maximum fun. I think they add quite a bit to the promising gameplay in the core box. 
It isn't overflowing with theme but the theme is there, especially if you read some or most of H.P. Lovecraft's stories (on which this game is loosely based). It's quite nerd-orientated and time-consuming, so probably not a game for a nice, little family evening. I have played sessions with around 4 players familiar with the game that had not ended after around 4-5 hours (with expansions)!
Bought it somewhen in 2009 and have played it with a bunch of friends nearly every other week for around one year (adding the expansions one at a time over the year). Then I was a bit fed up with the game. But I got it out for a gaming day the other day (2011) and had great fun (although we lost to Nyarlathotep) with a group of 6 other gamers who never played the game before.

Taken everything together I would say it is my favourite game of the ones I own. I think everyone interested in boardgaming as a hobby should have played at least a session or two in his gaming life and then can make up his mind if they love, hate or meh it.

Oh folkz, what an amazing game about the lovecraft universe. Such a tension, such a 1920s feeling - that's really one of the best games I ever purchased. Best with 3-4 players. Only problem: The endgame is much to easy for the players (when you simply go for it rather than close the gates). But this changes a lot with the expansions - then Arkham Horror is a real blast.

Finally got in a game of this.  It was fun, challenging, and looong.  Might end up being a little heavy time-wise for my taste, but definitely thinking of picking it up for the right moments.

Edit-  Forget what I said about it being too long.  We flipping love this game.  All 4+ hours of it.  

11-18-2013 - Oh, my sweet, poor little angel.  Bumped to a 9 by Eldritch.  Sorry AH, I still love you.

07-14-14 - You know what?  There's room at the top for both of you.  This isn't a winner take all battle here, we're all family.  You and Eldritch can both be 10s.  And you know what, I still haven't even PLAYED Eldritch but once.  You're still special, Arkham.  (please don't curse me)

A neat theme, but feels more like a story telling me what I am doing, rather than a game I am playing.

It is a very needy game to make work, but for the masses very worth it.

Plan this is an all day event. Very heavy set up factor.

Also everyone that likes this game, probably already owns it.  So if you don't like the game and own it, good like trying to pawn it off, as I am trying to.

I find it easier to find an eldersign than someone that will trade me for this game.

I am beginning to suspect I don't like cooperative games.  Something about the "deck" playing against you just feels like Fate, or Luck, or whatever you want to call it.  I suspect I like too much autonomy or agency to bother with these types of games.  

That said, it is extremely well-themed, and the graphics, etc., set a wonderful spooky mood.  I just think that perhaps next time I try it, I need to play with fewer than *all* the expansions!

One of the Best flavored games ever ,It's a cooperative ,so don't buy it if you don't like cooperation with other players. Probably there is a maximizing strategy knowing all cards .It doesnt' play the same in all the number of player,with some configuration you'd better aim for closing portals with Others you'd better aim to kill the ancient one at the end....(my favourite strategy is to obtain a work at the journal and then head for the Church and for some strong magic or normal item and then go for the final kill of the Ancient One...
But htat strategy is a little out of the game...probably the best thing is to play randomly pursuing the game as it flow otherwise you'll not enjoy it.

While I like RPG's and love thematic games, this one just isn't it. Maybe my gaming group and me just don't have the correct mindset for this game, but it just felt too mechanical.

RATING: 9
A nearly perfect adventure game that may very well become a 10 in time. Diverse characters, a loving use of the source material, a massive amount of non-dragging flavor text... everything to look for in adventure games. What's amazing to me is that this is partially cooperative but yet it doesn't feel that way to me (hence my use of the word 'partially'). There is still a huge amount of player interaction and everyone either wins or loses but at the same time I didn't feel like I HAD to work with my opponent/fellow-player in order to succeed. It would be stupid not to, but unlike Shadows Over Camelot or Lord Of The Rings, the game doesn't DEPEND on the cooperative to work and yet it is still fun and full of story. Amazing. The art work is the same used in the latest CCG and there is also plenty of elements that had been used in the original Mythos CCG that all Lovecraft fans should be very satisfied. And there are a lot of Lovecraftian elements not used that I could see fan expansions if not official booster possibilities galore (How about an international trip to London and Egypt with Harry Houdini? Or a trip to Innsmouth?). If the game continues to hold its excitement level for me, it could easily take its place on my 10 list.

Rating assumes you're my brothers, who already know how to play; otherwise, it's a 4.

I'm not normally a fan of cooperative games, and probably won't play this with my normal group, but my brothers like this pretty well, and I'll happily play it with them.

The theme does bug me: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/107083
And some of the graphic design--the Mythos cards are the dumbest design ever!  But the gameplay has been just fine, delivering hard-fought victories every time we've played (always 2-3 players, 1 investigator each, using the base rules).

Update: it doesn't [i]always[/i] play that well; in one 2p game vs. Shub-Niggurath (tougher monsters), we got a rumor card which caused the terror level to go to 10 and the town to be overrun.  After [i]hours[/i] of waiting for enough gates to open for the GOO to awaken so that we could kick its ass, we finally just skipped ahead to that part.  That game was just tedious.

Update: the last two games (3P and 4P with Dark Pharaoh expansion) have kind of stalled out after the first hour or two.  We quickly get to four gates sealed, and then the game drags on for another two hours while we seal the last two gates.

Update: dropping this to a 4.

Heavy in theme and replayability. FFG cut no corners in the areas of art, components, and writing. However, the game is quite complicated and can sometimes take quite a while to learn (let alone play). It is also not very difficult to win. The expansions helped out in that area, though.

AH has amazing production values.  There has never been a horror or Cthulhu game that looked this good or had such high quality components.  A lot of inelegant and unnecessarily fiddly rules do a fair job of simulating the Call of Cthulhu RPG and the game can be fun in balance.  But AH doesn't feel horrifying to me and is only tense in the early game.  The FAQ patches incorporated into the Dunwich Horror rules only slightly alleviate this, by ratcheting up the difficulty.  This FAQ's contents also demonstrate that AH was inadequately playtested before release.  The ratcheting up of difficulty with each successive expansion constitutes FFG acknowledging that the AH base game is imbalanced.

I am anxious to play it again.

[2008.May.01] This weighty game--can you say high bit count?--nicely encapsulates the growing horror that H.P. Lovecraft gave us with his Cthulhu Mythos. A cooperative game where the Investigators [players] work (hopefully) together to prevent/defeat the horrors that appear in the fictional town of Arkham, Massachusetts (USA). Unfortunately, a number of issues mar this wonderfully rendered FFG edition, including: (a) excessive randomness introduced via both dice rolling and card drawing, and (b) game mechanics that seem to prevent the game ending conditions from being met, thereby increasing the length of play. Unless your gaming group is a well-oiled machine, this one may take quite a few hours to finish and put back into the box.

Overly cumbersone game with too many cards. Takes forever to play and the end boss always feels random and slightly out of your control.

RATING: 6.5
Generally it's a good game. But the strategy with closing and sealing the gates always ends in neverending visits to the other worlds. That's not much fun and for now seems like an impossible way to win the game (with two players). And another flaw is the bunch of tokens you must manipulate during the course of the game.

I've had good times playing Arkham Horror. Lots of weapons, magic spells, random encounters, and dice rolling. And lets not forget the monsters, portals to other worlds, and the Ancient Ones...I mean where else can you have a nun casting spells while wielding an enchanted sword all in board game format?

RATING: 9
Love this game. It really is able to give you that frantic feeling that goes great with the game. At first the game will seem REALLY harsh but it is balanced so well it is amazing how it works. One thing to keep in mind is that you do NOT want to fight the end boss. The idea is that it should be nearly impossible to beat. I think a lot of people are turned off by this game because they let the boss out and get destroyed.

RATING: 5
Rich, immersive experience with excellent writing and art. Presentation is an A+. For experienced gamers, the game will be way too easy. I recommend using the house rules from the developer found here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Arkham_Horror/House%20Rules%20RL.pdf

Even so, the game will probably still be too easy.

[update] Traded away once I realized game was entirely luck-based and trivially easy to beat once you know how.

Based on the stories of H.P. Lovecraft the players are investigators discovering secrets that man was not meant to know to protect their home dimension.  Fun with the right group, but lots of pieces and some clunky rules.

I really enjoy Arkham Horror (and have a lot more plays then are logged, mostly from before I was on BGG), but I don't feel that the story elements are as strong as a lot of people make them out to be and find that although the game is fun, it is usually more fiddly and cumbersome then it is worth unless you have a group that is very familiar with it.

RATING: 6
Yes the game is heavy, it has a lot of components, rules and takes a lot of time to play. But the game is open anough to make various alterations and play modes with the same game (ex: Playing Mages or cultist). The only thing I found anoying is that it is hard to determine yourself objectives at the beginning of the game. The fact that you can play in coperative and even alone is interesting. I like the fact that it is some sort of game where you determine your own objectives toward a common goal which seems to fit for "Wanderer" types of players.

For the theme, I find it better than the call of cuthuluh RPG. In the RPG, it feels more pessimistic: "You are going to die, just try to survive long enough". In arkham horror, you can alway get back from death by health or sanity and you feel less powerless.

Update: Many years later, after playing again, I feel the game to be more work than fun. There is a lot of hidden rules easily forgotten, it seems you spend a lot of time updating the game, like moving monsters and other stuff. Finally, the object of the game is not that fun. You just move through gates, get back, seal the gate. Repeat the process until victory.

Now that Eldritch Horror is out, I don't think there is any reason to play this game anymore. Some people say AH is good if you have many expansions, but I don't because I do not have the space for it. I rather have a game that runs smoother and ends up faster.

RATING: 7
Has very good production quality, lots of bits, multi-card decks and a big board;  Fantasy Flight revision has added like twice more to every layer of the older Chaosium edition.  This new Arkham Horror can sometimes be long for my tastes with too much downtime if played with new/slower players.  When played with experienced or decisive players, this really works well, and if you've read the books, it is really rich in theme.

Played a solo game to get a feel for the game.  Definitely a bit more involved than Betrayal...:-)  I'm not sure how keen I am on the necessity of rolling a 5 or 6 to be successful in the "checks" but the modifiers add some interesting complexities and decisions to the game.  Thanks to the handy flowcharts available for download on the Geek and my knowledge of the game after my solo play, five of us completed a game in 2.5 hours.  I definitely enjoy the cooperative effort far more in this game than solo play.

I totally understand why this game appeals to such many gamers. It's an RPG without the DM. All the DM mechanics are interwoven with the mechanics of the game, and it is GREAT at telling the story of Arkham and the Great Old Ones. Everything really fit the theme (mechanics, art, etc.) and Kevin Wilson has done a great job with this one. But in the end, it's just too complex for me to really appeal all that much. I wouldn't mind playing the game through again as a full game (not just a demo), but I don't think my rating will ever change. This is the epitome of a "6" rating for me.

Interested to know why this game becomes so popular...sorry, but I was not impressed after one play.  It is more for the children, who is curious about exploration with an investigator in another world, full of Lovercraftian monsters, mido, vampires or dohls (yep, a lot of the names you won’t recognise).  The game takes the roleplaying model, where each investigator has different abilities in terms of 6 basic attributes Fight and Will, Speed and Sneak, Lore and Luck.  An investigator can use his or her Focus value to change the paired attributes each turn by the same number of move along a slide track.  I don't have a clue as to how the pairs are selected that way and why they must be so.  It looks too arbitrary as I don't believe the paired attributes are necessarily having an inverse relationship along the track.      

The combat system is a 5 or 6 to "succeed" with the no. of dices according to the investigator's attributes. The combat checks require "Fight" for physical monster and the horror checks require "Will" to stand up against monster.  An investigator is devoured when his Stamina and Sanity are both reduced to zero.  Fortunately you are never out of the game simply because of this.  You simply pick up another investigator to continue the story.  This may already suggests that it is a design solution when the investigators keep “devoured” by the game system when there are too many monsters to fight and havoc the streets of Arkham.  Before the investigators could have a chance to equip themselves adequate enough (they do have some possessions to begin with but…..), there are already a lot of the monsters on the streets, and some are quite powerful, guarding the way to the shop or other places where you can find or buy something additional to improve your attributes. 

If you don’t fight the monsters, they prevent the investigators to go to the gate and close or seal it in order to prevent the rise of the ultimate the Ancient One, the real one that you can’t defeat it easily.  If the investigator’s stamina is knocked down to zero, he or she goes to St. Mary’s hospital and discard of the items and clue tokens.  If the investigator’s Sanity is knocked down to zero, he or she goes to Arkham Asylum and lose the same half.  If they are knocked down when they are in the other world, they are lost in time and space and are delayed: they can’t move for the next turn. 

Monsters are spawned randomly anywhere in the city of Arkham by the drawing of the “Encounter” card, “Gate” card or “Mythos” card.  After they are spawned, the monsters walk randomly in the streets and locations according to the colors of their dimensional symbol (circle, diamond square etc.) along the black and white arrows.  Fast monster can move 2 spaces.  Flying monster can attack any investigators (the nearest or the lowest sneak value) on the street and attack them.  

There are random clues for the investigators to pick up when they stop after movement.  Random unique equipment but hack, the weapons are mostly physical and thus are useless while the mythos monsters are mostly physical resistant.  random clue tokens. Random gate open.

You use Elder signs to seal the gate.  An investigator can only seal the gate only after he or she return from the other world locations.  Of course, it means that you have to survive from the travel because monsters are encountered on the way.  The location of the gate and the types of monster encounters are randomly determined.  (Yes, random again.)  When you seal a gate successfully, the doom token would reduce by one on the doom track, delaying the Ancient One arrival.    

The game is trying to depict a sort of atmosphere backing up the story environment.  Some of these are trivial e.g. the environmental conditions while some are too random coming with the cards picked up during encounter.  There are book texts on the cards to create and describe the atmosphere but in the end, it is all about changing the numbers and values. You might gain skill card, magical card or ally card in the process.  Yes, someone might come up in a location and accompany you through exploration.  For those not familiar with the original stories, however, there is simply no difference to go directly to the changes and the reading of the text out loud for other investigators’ attention.  The other investigators would not be affected in any way what happens to one investigator.  

Arkham Horror...arghem...it really is a horrible game as its name suggests. Not my cup of tea, it is boring, truly random story development, search and destroy things with investigator wandering around on the board.  Yes, even how the Ancient One attacks is randomly determined in the beginning from one of the eight cards.  While the system is trying to build up the adventure, the pace and ratio of reward/ penalty just doesn’t match.  So you would find your investigators keep going to St. Mary’s Hospital or Arkham Asylum while they are half way on the road to their objectives.  It is very hard for them to restore their sanity or stamina to the full before they are asked to out in the field and explore again.  When they spend the money, money also hard to come by in the city of Arkham where everybody is trying to protect themselves and close the shops as the horror level goes up.  The time is short and the pressure is on too much.  This one is a pass on my book.  Other who have read the stories extensively, however, might find this game revives some of the most vivid but faded past memories in the 60’s.

This is my favourite game in my collection.  However I tried to introduce it to my friends with all the expansions included.  One of them was put off by the large amount of material.  So I sorted the game into its original compents and tried again a few months later.  This time they both loved it and I will bring it back to their house to play.  Eventually I'll introduce them to one expansion at a time.

Awesomely thematic Lovecraftian horror game. You will have great time playing with friends who can devote the time and are interested in the theme. It does have an immense replay value because of the different bosses and encounters you can face. Downsides are long playing time and complex rules (and not so well written rulebook). If you like Lovecraft and are into narrative sort of experience, you'll love this one.

If I have the time, patience and energy for it then AH is one of all time favourite games EVER!  It really scratches my Lovecraft itch whenever I get this to the table.  

It is a bit fiddly.  It is a bit rules-heavy.  It can take a bit of time to play.  But it's worth it.

The expansions make a great game even better but, be warned, they also turn a big game into a game that can become unwieldily.

Yes, I'd never played Arkham Horror before 2013. I don't know how it happened, it just happened. That's now been rectified and I really enjoyed it. It's a whack-a-mole coop, in that the players mostly run around trying to put out fires as they pop up and building themselves up to take on the tougher baddies. There was real tension as it looked early on like we were doomed (and there was one exceedingly poorly timed environment draw that we thought wrapped everything up right then and there.) However, we overcame the odds and managed to pull out a win -- and a fairly sizable one, I think -- against Yog-Sothoth. It was a good time, and I'm glad to have finally experienced this classic.

RATING: 1
Played this with 5 friends, then a 6th jumped in (seven players total). Could've spend 4½ hours (270 minutes!!!) of my life doing pretty much anything else.  

The game box really should limit the number of players to 3-5 (or at least state that as being optimal) instead of allowing for 8 players.  Needs some sort of "quick rules" like being able to move all at once or take encounters all at once and just passing the dice around.  Game needs more dice.  

Pretty sad day all around and only enjoyed by the one hard-core Arkham lover in the group.  At least 4, probably 5 of the players were absolutely miserable trying to play this, but in classic  Could've played 3-5 much better games instead in the time it took to slog through this (which didn't even finish).

The problem, as another rater suggested is that this game gives players no "Agency".  Decisions are meaningless.  Just prance around and hope that the cards don't royally fork you over.  When rewards do come around they are underwhelming and you feel as if you've worked for nothing and they can be lost easily anyway.

There are also TOO MANY mechanics. For example: why have cash?  How many players used it?  No one pursued getting it because it had essentially zero influence on the outcome of the game.  Why have 11 (or whatever it was) different decks of item cards?  Why not just have 1 deck for player cards?  Magic use always seemed like an awful choice and always came with severe penalties for not much benefit.

The narratives are nice but....maybe a little too much.  One rater on BGG who gave this game 10 stars (WHY?!!) said "Victory feels earned and every success is a result of strategy and skill."  Really, because I felt like there was 35 minutes of waiting around for my turn to even get to me and that there was absolutely zero strategy.  Skill?  Skill only matters when players have control over how their decisions affect outcomes.  I understand games need a chance mechanic (which I love) and need some form of risk an cost-benefit decision making, but Arkham Horror has none of that.  You essentially get what you draw and.....good forking luck.

Can I go ahead and give this game 0.5 stars?  It's terrible.  The artwork is beautiful though and I do enjoy the "universe" that it's set in.  So, there's that, at least.

Game is hard while we're still learning, managed to win once but not sure everything went right. Will play again soon.Played again and going easier now. I hardly forget anything it seems, and the cards and gates are shuffled a bit better, making the game feel a bit more random. I can see this becoming too easy when you play too often with the base rules (as we learn the most unstable gates we seal those first)Janet actually asked for this game this time, I was quite stunned.I lowered my rating by 0.5, because I find the game drags a bit when you are nearly there. More plays will show whether or not this is true, but quote "We almost won, but the game keeps spasming, get it over with already". We won, but the fun stopped a turn or 2,3 before the actual victory.
Update 10-5-08. Played again with 5 players againt Ithaqua, it was quite a good game (without expansions) and we managed to win quite easily. Game is far more enjoyable with more players.

fun but complex board game that takes around 6 hours for us to play. We only play 2 - 3 times a year due to the time commitment, but have fun playing it.

This makes a great solo game. Play it with 2 Investigators and it will be fun (and scary) as hell! My last play was solo with 3 investigators vs. Cthulhu, it was great!

The game alone is easy to win (even more when playing solo) so the need of expansions it's why I dont rate it a 10, after closing 5 gates or so without the expansion, you feel that the game will come to an end in a few turns.. that's not good!

Edit: I've played it a lot of times now, with Dunwich is great, but I'll like to play it with more people more often, the solo plays are getting old...

First play with 6 people went 4 hours and we were not even close to being done. Looking for a quicker end, we decided to take on the ancient one, Yog-Something-Or-Other. Reading what it takes to kill it (and noticing some more rules we missed) we decided to call it by stating we were devoured and move on to shorter fair.

Arkham Horror tries very hard to create a narrative and to be as realistic as possible. Unfortunately both of these aspects failed for me on some level. First, narrative was slow to develop as the rules were always a problem. A green monster moves what? A spell check is what (why they just don't call is a Lore check I will never know)? A nightmarish monster does what (why these abilities are not printed on the monsters also baffles me)? Etc. Second, the realism is conveyed in the following ways: by having many possible items that a player can collect, by having a variety of encounters, and by having cards/tokens each do many things. This variety creates heavy cognitive load for a game that is already rules heavy.

After one play, I think Arkham Horror could work well as a solo computer game (to handle the cognitive load and to have the ability to save then resume) or as a game with a maximum of 3 players because downtime was a problem.

[u]Result[/u]: Traded. Fun game and ideas, but too many rules and long play time meant it never got to the table.

Formerly my favorite game, now my second favorite through absolutely no fault of its own. It's system-heavy, its events are as random as a card deck gets, and the systems only relate because the game says they do, but the whole thing is redolent with its theme. It's not 100% faithful to the material (very few investigators deal with *that* many monsters in the Mythos stories), but it is a fun, pulp approach to the material, and it never shies from the theme for a second. I have never had a dull moment playing Arkham Horror, whether we're triumphing, being sucked into portals endlessly, or swinging from one to the other. I love collecting Clue tokens, fighting monsters, and getting pinballed around by the depravity that is the encounter deck. It's a long-runner, and the learning curve can be steep at first, but I can't recommend it enough.

One of the best cooperative games I've played so far. I'm a fan of the mythos and I love to watch my characters struggle through. Sometime they are heroic (the dual sword welding psychiatrist who can barely keep herself sane) or inept (The magician who had the best kit and spells, went through his first gate and had is brain turned into jelly by a ancient one).I love losing as much as winning.

[update] I never play it anymore, just feels random. I'd rather play Mage Knight.

7.5 > 6

RATING: 7
Great fun, but it is at times too easy to beat the game, especially if there are more players. The curse of the Pharao and Dunwich Horror fixes this to a large degree (Cultists! - yum yum!) 

It really does take up a whole lot of real estate - it is hard to fit Arkham and Dunwich on our dining room table, with space to spare for 4-5 players; and the table normally seats 6-7 persons, no problem! Also downtime becomes an issue with more than 4 or 5 players

Haven't tried the newest expansions (King in yellow and Kingsport), but I'm not convinced they add much to the originals.

(Rating increases dramatically with expansions.) A fun cooperative game with a nice, dark theme. Less of an atmospheric experience than Betrayal at House on the Hill, but the gameplay itself is more interesting.

Heaps of bits and pieces! A lot of rules (but if one players knows them, others can easily join in). Theme and artwork is great! It's really an uphill battle, and you have way to little time to do everything! I think I would prefer 4+ players. Great fun

If only it didn't take so long to set up, it would be perfect!  I say this as a devotee of the Call of Cthulhu RPG, which I played solidly for about three years.  Tone is exactly right.  The challenge is exciting.  I may try Eldritch Horror as an option, to see if it improves my experience.

RATING: 7
I love this game. I love the writing and the artwork, and I love the dice mechanic which is a success on a five or six where you need to get (x) successes. I also really like Lovecraft, so that's a plus.

However, it does take a while to set up, and it's somewhat complicated to teach, so I don't get to bring it out often. Moreso since most of the people I play with are casual gamers. 

Additionally, the newer Eldritch Horror has a more streamlined feel while adding a few new mechanics that make it more interesting (like spells you flip over to see its effects). Much of the reason why I even keep this one is because I like the idea of travelling around Arkham more than travelling around the world (I'm a Lovecraftian fangirl like that). So, I would recommend Arkham Horror with a grain of salt.

took me half a day to read through the rules and understand the basic game play.

The game is quite thematic, we liked it quite alot. However there are lots of rules and components you need to keep track and that spoils the game a bit. Maybe it is the first time i played, so i needed to refer to the rule book frequently and this increased the game time.

I think this game has v.good components with terrific atmosphere, however it may not be a game for beginners or ppl who don''t like science fiction.

2nd game.... also stopped half way through.... being going for 2.5+ hrs... and is getting tired..... we both liked the game.... but just don''t have the energy to finish it....

3rd game... played for 4.5+hr... well pass midnight... but still only 3/4 of the game... t he game is very entertaining, but i doubt i can find ppl to play with me :<
we had an enironment that prevented us from sealing the gate, that hindered our strategy alot

RATING: 5.1
This one lacks intelligent game mechanics to make it at least a little bit variable and more interesting. There is nothing mystic about constantly rolling dice. Surprisingly there is a lot of downtime although you really don't have to do a lot in your turn. But often times you have to sit one or two turns, which really makes the game boring at times. Unfortunately this aspects overshadow the pros of arkham horror (theme, artwork) by far. That's really sad, because the quality of the game is pretty good and the theme really has a lot of potential which has been just not brought to the table with this one...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very thematic, sprawling game.  The level of engagement depends entirely on the quality/mood of the players.  Mechanically it is quite simplistic, but compensates for that with theme, character and atmosphere.  A must if you are a Cthulhu fan, but not for you if you dislike co-op games or dice-fests

I think this is my only 'preliminary rating'. This is a super-immersive game! With too many mechanics and game stuff going on, which get in the way of that immersion at this point. We've played this a few times, and also had some false starts trying to work it all out.

I have high hopes that with just a play or two more I'll know whether I can just play the game or worry so much about the mechanics. My rating will surely change +/- 1 point or so. It is hard to get this played so it will be a while.

this is a 6 for the base game.

8 with dunwich

The base game suffers from a period of boredom in the middle to late game.   enough gates are either sealed or opened that few new ones open up, making the doom track go slow, and clue tokens become rarities.   if enough gates (and the right gates) are sealed then the last hour of the game is boring...the heroes are going to win and know it...its just a matter of gathering the correct # of clues.   

StormKnight Variant helps with this, but the best solution is to get Dunwich.

RATING: 9
Probably the heaviest co-op game that I love, Arkham Horror is incredibly thematic and intense. I love the variety in characters and the fact that no two games are the same, despite doing basically the same thing every time. Plus, there are a shitton of cards and monsters, so it really does feel like a unique adventure into the world of Lovecraftian Horror every time you play. Plus, tentacles!

My first "new" boardgame in quite some time.  I love it!  Plays solo nicely, but I do prefer playing with others.  

A memorable moment:  Our resident eleven year old once declared "Someone's got to do something!" during a game.  That sense of urgency and impending doom comes often in Arkham Horror.  If you have two or three hours and love lots of cardboard bits, this is your game.

This game nailed the Lovecraft feel. It's hands-down the most atmospheric board game I've played. Only thing holding it back from a better score is the amount of rules and the fiddliness. My wife and I play it frequently controlling two characters each and we're able to knock a game out in under 2 hours.

AH could be a lot of fun.  I think it has potential.  My biggest beef with it is the lack of challenge it provides.  I have played prolly a half dozen times and never felt as tho the game stood much of a chance.  I would like to try out some of the rules tweaks suggested here to see if they breathe some difficulty into the game.  Bumped it up a half point after playing with the Curse of the Dark Pharaoh expansion and Herald rules.

If you like the whole you vs. "EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE THROWN AT YOU" premise, then you will enjoy this game.  The game being explained to me went something  like this: "If situation a happens you die. If situation b happens you die.  If situation c happens you when but only if situation d is not true.  If time expires, then your pretty much screwed, because you have to fight the old great one, and they are just super powerful."

After stating this, the person explaining the game to me must of seen the horrific look in my face stating, "How the hell does anyone win this game."  He said, "Don't worry, your supposed to feel helpless."

On a side note:  My team (6 of us were playing) did win the first time we played.

but the game is worth it for depth of theme and adventure.  without the expansions it can get a bit easy once youve figured things out.  it actually feels backwards of most games b/c the danger grows pretty fast and quickly early on, but then slows down dramatically after youve sealed key unstable areas.

What a frustratingly boring and tedious game. As others have said, game play is non-intuitive, and really, without real decisions.  Yes, the game is beautiful (although, did the board really have to be that big?), and the bits pretty good quality (although, I was surprised by the amount of cardboard as a opposed to plastic figures -- all about cost to produce, I guess).  I would rather participate as the victim in a real life 'Marathon Man' dental procedure than play this one again.  That's 4+ hours of my life I'll never get back.

I can see how people could rate it low -- it's kind of boring, in a way; there's not a whole lot of strategy; the ending battles are total dicefests; there's a million rules, a thousand of which you're likely to forget; it's fiddly; a nightmare to set up; takes a long time.

None of it matters.  For an RPG experience distilled into a boardgame, it doesn't get better than this, at least for me.  The writing and artwork are superlative.  The materials are high-quality.  It's fanciful, over-the-top and somehow classy, all at once.  At the end of a game, I'm exhausted; I feel like I've been somewhere and back.  And exhausted as I am, part of me is just one impulse away from setting it up and going on the ride again.

An enjoyable game with great theme and atmosphere, although a bit too luck dependent for my taste - some playthroughs are great, some are frustrating, some are boring, some are too long, and some end too fast. There's also a little bit too much pressure from the opening Gates - you never seem to have enough time to do some shopping or collect some clue tokens and I would like to delve deeper into the theme and exploration, not just race from Gate to Gate. I seem to have luck considering Elder Signs, without them I think it may get too frustrating and there isn't that many of them. Nevertheless, the game has great, dark atmosphere and enjoyable gameplay, not to mention beautiful artwork and component quality.

Logistics are a problem with this one: requires large table, long setup time, long play time. Scale back some of these and I'd play it much more (and rate it higher).

Lore/fluff is fantastic.

Expansions never really added much exciting.

Good single player, although still suffers from the logistical issues.

Good variety of characters and abilities.

If you enjoy playing a game that you just can't win, takes hours upon hours, rolls WAY too many dice, tons of luck with a repeat strategy... its great.

If you love the theme and are willing to sit through a 6 hour game this might be the game for you. Otherwise I'd avoid it like the plague. My experience has been that the game drags out far too long for what it is and that either one player dominates the team (ala pandemic) or that the game ends up feeling like a grueling 6 hour game of solitaire. I've heard that with repeated plays (and more experienced teams) some of these problems work themselves out but I'm not sure I'm willing to suffer through enough games to get to that point.

Great game.  Love the theme, gameplay, bits, and degree of luck.  The game is awesome 2-player and, the few times when we have more folks with whom to play, expands well.  The only downside is the time required, which will decrease significantly as we get increasingly familiar with the game.  Game also gets increasingly enjoyable (and AP decreases) as folks are more willing to realize that its a game to be played for fun, not necessarily to win.

Lowered to an 8 and thinking of dropping it further given unnecessary complexity of rules, big space and time requirements, and feel that the game plays itself.

If, after playing my first couple games of [b][thing=15987][/thing][/b], had I been asked what I thought the replay value of this game was, I would have said, low. What a stupid, random, luckfest of a game...that just keeps getting more and more interesting. Once I got over the lack of Lovecraftian horror in the game and got to know it a bit better, I began to understand that [b][thing=15987][/thing][/b] is really not so chaotic and random; there are a finite number of cards and if you have some idea as to what's on them, then you can start to play the probabilities; what are the chances a gate in Independence Square will open as compared to Hibb's Roadhouse? What's the probability that you can sneak past that Dark Young one to enter the gate? How can I improve my chances and ultimately mitigate the risks?  I still don't consider [b][thing=15987][/thing][/b] one of my favorite games. There are plenty of games I would rather play, but for a cooperative, it's worth dragging out every so often.

As a long time role-player, I probably expected too much from Arkham Horror. This is definitely well-made, gorgeous game, but after one play it left me with "meh" feeling.

I'd give it another try, though - maybe the rating will go up after that. We'll see...

EDIT: It definitely went up after 2nd play, but not much. It seems there's just too much components and special rules, and a lot of them with no apparent use except in very specific situations.

Solid theme, but smooth gameplay is hindered by the incomplete rulebook. In the two times I've played, I had to resort to BGG or the FAQ to find the solution to some rules-issue or contradiction. 

Furthermore, the game feels like there is very little actual strategy involved. Some people call this more of an experience than a game, and I believe they are right in saying so. You can sort of plan ahead as to what your strategy for the next few turns will be, but one bad die-roll or an unlucky card and your efforts have been without effect. That does fit the Lovecraft-theme, but perhaps works better in a book than in a game.

The story the game tells is not very coherent, there is not much of a link between the events that happen and the ancient one you try to keep asleep (besides the small number of special rules per ancient one).

The game takes very long for what it is, and I think there are most definitely better games out there that manage to tell a good story in half the time and with half the rules.


Update: I somehow still sometimes think back of this fondly. I miss a 'relaxed' gaming experience like this, where you can just watch a grand story unfold (even though the story is not always very good). I might check out Eldrich Horror, or the new Arkham card game sometime in the future..

Picked up June 2006 - traded away
Picked up in trade Aug 2007

Cooperative as well as solitaire play.

Played my first solo game Aug 1, 2006
2 characters - The Gangster and the Researcher vs Yig
It was a short game as they managed to close 3 gates. The Gangster started with one Elder Sign and  he managed to be near the first opened gate. It didn't take him long to close it. During several Mythos rounds new gates were unable to appear. The Researcher had very high Evasion ability so was easily able to circumvent the monsters in her way to close her gate. There was a quick dash to the third and final gate and although the Gangster ended up lost in time and space, the Researcher got lucky and was able to pull herself back into Arkham via a mysterious rope immediately. A new gate was unable to open up so a monster appeared, which the Researcher was able to defeat. As soon as she did, she successfully closed the gate, sacrificing the Gangster for the good of all Arkham. All in all rather fiddly, but the turns did flow better than I was expecting. My initial rating is a 6 for now, but I will play it again because I think there is something here I have yet to discover. I think some organizational aids will be pretty helpful too.

2/2015 It doesn't say so, but "re-implemented by Eldritch Horror" would be an appropriate addition.  Most of the nuisance and tediousness have been ironed out in Eldritch .. rating down 9 -> 8, super-seeded by Eldritch Horror

10/2007 Greatly exceeded expectations. Games with lots of fiddly bits doesn't impress me, here though, all the parts added to the flavour of the game and for added re-playability.  Somewhat comparable to Betrail at House On Haunted Hill in genre, but much better in gameplay.

7/2008 Always on the lookout for the next Arham Horror game session.  Rating up 8 -> 9.

Strong Lovecraft theme.  Can be a difficult game to win, especially with fewer players but the tension in each turn makes Arkham Horror a lot of fun.  Many expansions for high replay-ability.  May have been replaced by Eldritch Horror for most, but still well worth playing. Highly recommended.

juego cooperativo. Los jugadores son llamados investigadores. En el transcurso del juego, estos se enfrentan a la aparición de monstruos y la apertura de "portales" a mundos extraños.

RATING: 2
Great theme, which the cards really use, but the basic mechanism doesn't really work, nor do mechanics match the theme. Play is wandering round just picking up clues and closing gates. Feels more like tidying up than fighting evil.  

Lacks the "Will we make it?" tension of other co-ops. Many turns lack decisions and anything usefull to do.

Usually win and usually know whether you've won by half way through.  Last hour or so (at least) is a drag.

Several other complaints with it that I can't be bothered to go into.

LOTR does a better job of it by matching the actual game system to the theme;  AH has the right chrome, but the nuts and bolts aren't there.

If someone designed a good game with this theme, AH would never have seen the light of day.  It sells only because no other boardgame covers the subject matter.

This is a wonderful cooperative horror game. There's so much going on (and so many many cards), that it doesn't get boring. Defeating the monsters and the scary-ass Old Ones isn't easy, so it requires a lot of creative thinking and teamwork. Lots of scope for role-playing and adding scary atmosphere.

Arkham Horror is a very complex game, and for me (particularly while learning the game), that complexity often distracts from the rich theme of the game - it's a shame. I sometimes feel this game might have worked if rather than being purely cooperative, one of the players was instead made to a play an overlord (or GOO) - giving one player the responsibility of managing all the monsters' affairs would have left the rest of the gameplay more streamlined.

There are some tricks that make managing some of the details a little easier, such as using plastic stands to hold monsters as an effective way of counting how many monsters are allowed out at once. Once the game processes are down pat, focussing on the story becomes a little easier, and the game becomes a richer experience.

Arkham is one of those games that is ambitious in scope and in concept but that ultimately, due to the sheer weight of all of the mechanics at play, fails. If you are interested in Arkham but want something that plays better, you are better off picking up its unofficial sequel, Eldritch Horror.

RATING: 8
[Played more than 100 times]
Sort of multiplayer gamebook (or simple RPG with an automated Master).
Theme is nicely implemented. Some efforts to "roleplay" (when possible) improve the experience.
A bit of strategy and tactic is possible, but luck has a decisive role (cards and dice rolls).
Cards and characters aren't too well balanced.
Rules have some ambiguities and missing points; you'll have to fill the gaps and add some house rules to make the game playable (download the latest FAQs as well, since they're finally available).
It doesn't scale very well: too easy with more than 4 characters (and a lot of downtime) and too difficult with only one or two (we suggest: when playing solo, use 3 or 4 characters; with two players, use 2 characters each). I won't play it again with more than 4 players.
Game lenght was significant, but is reduced to about 2 hours (with up to 4 players) after some games. 
It becomes repetitive (similar gameplay and too few cards). Expansions alleviate this problem.
Fine components.

Overall, it is an EXPERIENCE the first time(s) and you MUST modify it to make it a decent GAME (my rating regards the game after you find a suitable set of global rules; it'd get only a "4" considering the game "as it is out of the box").

Arkham Horror served as my gateway to tabletop gaming many years ago. I was drawn to its deep Lovecraftian roots, but didn't expect much, as previous experiences with Lovecraftian video games and movies were usually disappointing. Thankfully, Arkham Horror delivered! It's a fantastic game filled with familiar horrors brought to life by well written flavor text and challenging gameplay. I will say, it's not for everyone. It's the kind of game I usually have to dedicate a whole day to. I'd say about half of the time my group ends up losing to the ancient ones. Granted, this is a game I can enjoy losing, but not everyone agrees with me on this one. The solitare play is still really fun though, so I can enjoy losing all by myself :P
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
I really disliked this game at first, then became ambivalent, and finally okay with it.  After more and more plays I got a better glimpse of the beauty in the flow of the game.  Once you have the rules down tight, the game moves very quick and I can usually finish a game in less than an hour solo, or a couple hours with more players.

The entire thing feels very satisfying no matter how it all ends.  I feel like a story has played out each time and it always amazes me how each game feels so vastly different from the last.  I never leave a game feeling like it played out just like before.  Even more, patterns start to form in the random chaos to make you believe that the game "knows" or has a will of its own.  

In my last game I had a Warlock and a Cultist spawn right across the street from each other.  Then I immediately drew "The Great Ritual" card for Warlocks and Cultists in the street between them.  I failed to find enough tokens to stop the ritual, and a turn later, almost in response to my failure, the God of the Bloody Tongue emerged from the Warlock's Gate.  Yikes!

The game constantly throws stories out like this that seem to make logical sense.  Is it just coincidence, or does it really have a mind of its own?!  I don't know, it's kind of spooky, but I really like this aspect of the game.

I love the amount of choices each game that I have and how our players only get to participate in certain aspects of the world each time.  There are not many other games that provide for so much re-playability without relying on more content to deliver it.

The Lovecraft theme really helps this game as well, and the more stories I read and re-read from Lovecraft, the more I appreciate the game that builds on it.  This game really is like a fine wine that gets better the more you understand the Lovecraft universe.

Finally, I feel like the game really benefits from the number of expansions and fan content that has been released over the years.  I highly recommend the smaller board variant, it instantly makes the game far more playable.  Some say that Eldritch Horror surpasses Arkham because of its streamlining, and while I haven't played it yet, I don't think I would agree.  I like the heavier rules and choices, and I like the more "role-play" feel this game provides that many say has been lost in EH.

I also own the Dunwich Horror Expansion.

The only real horror here is how far this game misses the mark.  Surprisingly flavourless, random, and fiddly.   I'd get as much Lovecraftian feel out of munching the counters. The game was actually acceptable for Eurogamers when I was running the show and checking the rules, but since the rulebook is so bad that meant a lot of work and constant leafing through still created awkward breaks however patient the players.  Not likely to repeat again unless asked.

Rather sad that so much effort was lavished on components and then they went for a completely abstract board that essentially wipes out the city map underneath.  The old edition was much better in this respect.

One of my favourite games, great atmosphere and theme. The randomness can get a little bit annoying sometimes, but those games which seem hopeless are often the best ones with everyone making an effort and working together so victory can still be achieved.

It also has great variety, maybe the most in any game I know. Every game is different.

A horror-Cthulhu-theme dice-fest set in a classic Lovecraftian world. Player co-operate in saving the world from the imminent destruction caused by strange tentacly horrors coming through dimension gates. The game has its moments, but basically it's pure luck-of-the dice, and the odds are ALWAYS against you - most often so strongly that you just want to give up, leave the dice on the board and curl up in the corner of the toilet to wait for the end. And the expansions only add to the difficulty, making it basically unbeatable unless the players co-ordinate with military precision AND have magical luck with the die rolls.

Initially, I was reluctant to play this.
This game (and games like it) are best described as a combination of a dungeon crawl and a RPG. 

I had fun playing it three times. Then the luster wore off. Also, there are too many expansions that convolute game play.

If given the option, I would rather play the RPG, as opposed to an adaption of a RPG into a board game.

This was my first trade.  I just didn't enjoy it solo - it seem overly fiddly - I was overwhelmed.  However, I wish I would have held onto it.  Now that I have a regular game group, I would have tried it with them.

Notably, I traded it for Phantasy Realm, which I also did not enjoy.  I traded that for Nexus Ops and Tongiaki.  I doubt Tongiaki will make it to the table anytime soon, but I think Nexus Ops will.

I found this much more enjoyable, easier, quick and intuitive to play than I expected (at least, based on my reading of some others' comments). I think it helps though if you have previously played Mythos or FFGs Coc collectible card games, as the types of cards and their effects will be familiar. Great atmosphere, and rules can be modified easily to improve the playability for non-gamers, and add some competition (e.g. allow anyone to close an open gate - while another investigator is in an Other World location!)

The co-op game all others should be judged against.  The rules are hard going and you'll spend most of your first few games with your head in the rulebook.  Oh, and you'll lose.  A lot.  If you're winning most of your games, re-read the rulebook, you're doing something wrong!

The game is dripping with theme.  The Art is top notch.  The quality of the components is superb.

There are so many variables that you will never have 2 games the same.  I swear the thing is sentient, but then the system was created by a man with a degree in AI.

This was a perfect example of how wrong it is to listen to the reviews, in stead of going with the brain/gut/heat.

This should play well with 2 people - even as solitaire.

It's co-op.

It's heavily themed.

It's being praised in the reviews.

So I thought it would be a good game for the girlfriend and me. Boy was I wrong. First of all, we are not used to games that plays in more than 2 hours. 5 hours into our first game, and we were still unsure about the rules of the game. It didn't run smooth. 

We gave it 6 or 7 tries besides that, but every time we played, we got tired before the end of the game. And I mean tired like you have been writing an exam for the past 5 hours. It was not fun. The use of dice made the game like a giant version of ludo, but with characters and special abilities - that will last for 5 hours..

not many of meaningful choices, doesnt feel too deep but is challenging. A long list of rules but doesn't feel like too many not are they that confusing, kinda a challenge to remember them all.
Though its a run around the map and fix the world like pandemic, its just so much better with all thats added like character sheets that are complex and make a difference, having stats, having story, having different doom events, items, different enemys....a deep enough coop to feel that its more than a solo

A beautiful remake of a game that, in the end, has far too many fiddly bits and is way too clunky to rate very high. The great theme and replayability save it from eBay. Plus, you have a to love a game you can lose during set up.

I appreciate the theme, but this co-op especially suffers from one player telling everyone else what to do.

Setup time is extreme, and the game takes absolutely too long for how simple it is. Also, it is just stupid how little variation there is in the huge decks of spells and items.

One thing I do like is the pressure from some of the key monsters. I love to see everyone's expressions when Tindalos appears on the board. That's where the theme really shines.

Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!

The game has some faults, some strengths, too much to describe in a short text. The one thing that really elevates this game is the atmosphere it creates and the interaction between players; irregardless of new or experienced players with this system, its always a bucket of laughs, creative comments, and you never really feel the down-time.

Very good themed game. Complex systems, but once you get the hang of it, you get a fast paced turn flow. It is probably a bit too random for those who don't like dice.

RATING: 7
Wonderful theme makes up for slightly awkward mechanics. Has an epic feel and comes reasonably close to an RPG-experience. Comes with a million cards, which I love. 

It really helps to get into the theme/storytelling aspect of the game. 

Downside: it's very long! This, of course, contributes to the "epic feel", but the game requires stamina. Playing with larger groups is not the best idea, because it's guaranteed that someone will be zoning out somewhere around the end of the third hour. 

Plays well with two through four, though. With two, we like to use either three or four investigators.

I give this a Meh.  I've only played the one time, and it may very well get better over time.  However in this game i spent the first 8 turns stuck in the Black Cave.  Not a lot of fun.  The theme to this game is great, but it seems pretty luck driven, and has a lot of downtime.  I wouldn't turn it down out of hand if someone wanted to bust it out again, but I don't think I would ever suggest it or buy it.

     While this game is jam packed with luck, it's also spilling over with theme, detail and more despair than a boatful of Gugs sailing through the Colour Out of Space.  You'll lose often, but fans of Lovecraft will enjoy every maddening moment and perhaps others will as well. It's fun trying to figure out which group of characters and strategy works best for defeating each Ancient One. Also, solo play works here.

RATING: 8
First game was too easy and too fiddly to be great, second game was better, and a couple of games with only three or two heroes were very lost, but fun. Not scary, though, but I never expected a boardgame to be as scary as an RPG or book could be. 
Played 5+ times.

Update: Although I still admire the design, a recent play confirmed that pure cooperation games are just not my thing. Accordingly, Arkham Horror was sent to a better home.

Nice game but very difficult. I've only played with 1 or 2 players (each with one investigator). I like cooperative games, and this one is really good, and  it's one where you really have to cooperate if you want to win. We play with soe variants so that the 2 player game is not too hard. The rules seem complex at first but it's not so bad...

The game requires cooperative play, which is emphacised enough in the rule book. The forces of *EVIL* will win every time if the players don't pull it together. Some of the characters seem more competitive than others. The plastic character stands tend to rip up the cardboard character pieces. It is fun and has a great theme though!

RATING: 2.5
I know a lot of people love this game.  It just REALLY isn't my thing.  PERHAPS if I played with someone that knew all the rules, but I've put hours into it and MAYBE 10 percent of that time was actually spent PLAYING.  The rest of the time we're looking up fiddly little rules and clarifications, finding out we're playing wrong, etc..  Besides that it's just too long for my taste and I don't particularly like taking turns reading several sentences of scenarios, abilities, special powers, encounters, etc. etc..... and then reading the rules some more to make sure we're doing everything right.

No thanks.  I'd rather have simpler rules, shorter play time, and actually be "playing" for most of that time.

Having said all that, it appears that the game has a lot of thought and production value put into it.  I can appreciate that, but it just isn't my cup of tea.

RATING: 4
This is more of an experience than a game.  Lots of randomness, not enough variety in the encounters, and lack of clarity in the rules drags down an otherwise very strong theme.  More of a choose your own adventure co-op game than a normal boardgame.  

This is the kind of game that I might play once a year, with the right group, but no more than that.  

This game needs some serious streamlining to be enjoyable.  Downgrading to a 4 after a 4.5 hours (victorious) game.

RATING: 5
The game was fun for the first few playthroughs, but it quickly became boring due to lack of interesting decisions. Modyfying your stats and deciding where to go isnt enough to keep me invested, especially that you usually go either to the nearest clue or the nearest portal. 

A single match takes a while and isnt all that much satisfying, so Ill probably refuse any invitations to play Arkham Horror again.

RATING: 9
This is a great board game for gamers. It is a borderline "role-playing" game. But I have scared off people with the amount of rules.

Once you get the hang of the rules you can have a blast, but watch some tutorials or read the forums for rule clarification because not knowing how it works bogs down play time, equals not fun, and having people cringe when you mention the name.

RATING: 7
This is a game I'd really like to like. I highly respect Lovecraft's works, I prefer games that have deep theme and love all those hundreds of little pieces with beautiful illustrations. BUT. Somehow all that dice-rolling just feels endless. It just seems to be playing itself and all I can do is try to remember numbers. The only thing rescuing the game would be some role-playing oriented group, where the lousy mechanics would only make the environment for a bit different play. The athmosphere the game itself gives  doesn't really resemble Lovecraft's art.

For all the fans of this game expected a little more from it. Not sure if we follow the rules correctly but seems to be a lot of fiddly bits that detract from the experience.

Might have to try at a convention with experienced players to truly judge its worth.

This game gets too much of a bad rap.  It's totally cooperative, but unlike Pandemic, it doesn't lend itself to someone quarterbacking the experience.  There are lots of things to do, and the game is different each time, since besides the different character powers and weapons/items in play, there can be a different Big Bad to defeat!

Not a short game, and there are a zillion pieces and cards around to increase setup time, but I think it's worth it.  Also, it's good to have a slightly heavier game that can incorporate so many players.

Average rulebook, game is a bit too much on the heavy side compared to the original game, but otherwise, the ultimate Lovecraft themed boardgame, action, horror and fantasy all the way. The fact that it has been expanded so much by FFG is great.

I found that the first edition "dark" board was better than the "corrected" one...

I must add that I don't understand why I read so many comments these days about how "heavy" it is (i'm talking the game alone, without the expansions). This is really the same weight and length for me as many so called "heavy" boardgames, like "Merchants and Marauders", "Dune", "Fury of Dracula", "Twilight Struggle", "Age of Conan", "Labyrinth"... 

But it sure is not heavier than them and does not at all deserve to be called "dauntingly heavy" or so. This is game that can be played in one evening, two games can be played in an afternoon...  Certainly not the monster game that it sometimes is called these days...

Looooooooooong. Played with 7 players... lots of down time and got mind-numbingly dull. However, I will play again - with a smaller group and see if this one cant get redeemed. Can so many BGG'ers be wrong??

UPDATE: 04-25-09

Played it with the CVW again last night after a long hiatus. I was pretty solid on the rules, but there is still a lot going on here and the initial explanation of everything takes a bit of time. Like before, I could tell that people were anxious to play, so I kept the explanations as short as possible and taught the game as we played out the first turn.

It took a few turns to get the flow going right, but once we did, everyone enjoyed the game. I think the sweet spot is 4-5 players as more tends to bog the game down - unless EVERYONE is comfortable with how to play.

We still made mistakes in some rules - but we corrected as we played and pushed on. We lost the game to the GOO that ends the game immediately if it ever awakens - we weren't paying attention and sealing enough gates - otherwise we might have had a chance.

Upgraded to a solid 8.5 and with plenty of interest to play again in the group.

UPDATE: 30-OCT-2010

Upgraded to a solid 9. We are now able to sit-down and PLAY the game without constant rule look-ups which increases the fun and decreases the playing time. The mechanics are now 2nd nature and we can focus on the strategy and game play instead of "what happens next?".

UPDATE: 12-10-2013

We got to play this two weekends in a row a few weeks ago (lost both games!) and it was a complete hoot! Arkham Horror has only steadily climbed up my ratings chart. It's tremendously fiddly with all kinds of exceptions and things that you have to try and remember, but once you have the basic flow down this all becomes much easier and you can simply focus on what needs to be done. Add in an expansion and watch the game take on a whole new feeling - Innsmouth is probably my favorite for this effect.

I must first admit I never read an H.P. Lovecraft novel.  For some reason, AH doesn't quite cut it for me.  In the end, the fiddliness, long setup time and downtime got to me.

Guess it drew the Ameritrash line for me.

I really tried to like this game. I know it´s a cornerstone of the thematic games. I respect the design, but I believe this game has shown to me that I´m an eurogamer. 

I think this game is very tiring. It´s a lot of rules, a lot of details, a lot of dice, a lot of paperwork, for so little decision making. And the playing time does not help at all.

The problem is: my wife just loves it! But I convinced her to play Zombicide instead of AH. It´s not so immersive but it takes considerably less time.

Choose your music, your room, your friends, your evening,... and enter the world of HPL. Replace the "token" with the depicted monter in your mind, read and figure out the scene in your mind... play this game as you read a book or as you see a movie! This is more an "adventure" game than a "strategy" game.

Base game is too flawed (encounters are useless, Ancient One is a cakewalk, too many things that you just don't touch if you want to win) to be considered a good game.

RATING: 8
My rating is after 3 plays.  The third play is when we finally "got" the rules; everything clicked, we hardly had to consult the rulebook, and the turns went quickly.  It was still somewhat long, but repeated play should bring the time down even more (our first two games went too long for the type of game it was; the third game went 3 hours for 6 players).  I wasn't sure to rate this 7 or 8; the newness of the game and my desire to explore it more may have added a point, but if we get the time down a bit more, it's well worth an 8.

Well it's a classic, I always want to play it, and never cease to amaze me. Yes it have a lot of fault: a play can last for hours and hours, it is impossible to play (to win) if you have 3 or less players.. you have some chance starting to 4 or more players.. and it's really really luck based. But I totally like the atmosfere, the story event are intriguing, the fight with monster difficoult in line with the story, you can play it 10 times, and it will be 10 times different. If you apply the expansion well it will never became boring. Yes to me is the game that resemble more the original story background of H.P. lovercraft.
And lastly it's a cooperative game, that's the point. When it appeared on the market it was one of the few coopeerative games, so I really love it for that reason.

A perennial favorite, and one that I credit with getting my group into modern-day board games. Love the co-op, love the, erm, Lovecraft, love the production values, love the encounters and story text and narrative opportunities.

You haven't lived until you've played a drifter forced to sacrifice his dog to a hideously betentacled beast in the streets just so the nun can charge in on a motorcycle wielding a flamethrower and wipe out the beasties. Yeah. It's that kind of game.

Playing time can be long (although nobody ever mentions the fact that it can also be quite short depending on how the game goes) and the original rulebook isn't terribly well written, but get an expansion or two and you've got an evergreen game for your collection.

Theme! The feeling of overwhelming odds only getting worse is bang-on for Lovecraft country; yes, it is totally random, but the atmosphere is excellent. My only gripe is just how random and characterless the otherworld encounters are, but I never did enjoy Lovecraft's Dreamlands much. The components are lovely, it's easy to see what is going on at any time (maybe the gates could have higher contrast to the board, but they're not hard to find. The art on the box makes me laugh: nobody seems too worried by the tentacles - business as usually in Arkham!

I enjoy this game more than my wife - who prefers Eldritch Horror.  Arkham takes a while to set up and games can last a long time. There are flaws to the game and you'll end up reading and re-reading the long instruction book a lot.  And, like most of the horror games, if you're losing, the slog to your ultimate demise can be a bit boring.

This is one of those games that you have to be in the mood for.  It has a huge learning curve...our first game took about 4 hours, and we were constantly referring to the rule-book!  Once you get the gist of the game mechanics, it is one of the most immersive gaming experiences around.  Truthfully, this game is a punishing, non-stop pain in the butt...but when you want a challenging co-op, this is the one you go for!  The expansions are good for adding variety to the "encounters" phase, but can make the gameplay ridiculously overwhelming and unwieldy.

Solo: My first play of AH was also my first-ever solo game apart from Solitaire, purchased primarily for that purpose. It rocked. (Initial rating: 8.)

There's a ton of luck, which I don't usually like, but it's more than mitigated by the story that emerges over the course of the game, the mood, the Lovecraftian feel, and the fun factor. As a huge fan of both HPL and Call of Cthulhu, I expected to like all that stuff but was concerned the luck factor would still be too high; it wasn't.

I played (and won, which means I probably did something wrong) a two-investigator game over the course of a couple of days, leaving it set up on my desk -- where it barely fits. Loads of fun solo.

---

Months later, my first solo play remains my only play. Compared to the many other solo options that are now in my collection, notably Eldritch Horror, the fiddliness factor and length of Arkham have prevented me from wanting to play it. I re-rated it a 6 (down from an 8), sat on it for a couple months, and then sold it.

Although a bit long, I really like it. The order in which Myth cards show up definitely decides whether it will be an easy, though or impossible game. The huge stack of Myth cards therefore makes this game totally different from one game to the other.

RATING: 10
Got to be my favourite game of all time. Plays exceptionally well either solo or with a team. Due to the large amount of investigators, great ones and supplements no two games are that alike. 

Exceptionally well supported by FFG, there have been lots of supplements which just add to the replay value.

The only downside to this game is the amount of space you need to play it!

For me the pacing is critical to the enjoyment of this beautiful game.  Everyone plays their parts without taking forever to group/individually decide every tiny detail.  That micro/macro manage thing.  Get out their and do your job investigator!

Still enjoy this one - can get a little crazy with too many expansions at once.

There are so many interesting facets to this game, but there are numerous mechanical problems in my opinion. The difficulty level is regarded by some to be too easy, by others too hard. The game also tends to drag if the players are not doing so well. I would have preferred a great deal less randomness. The outcome of nearly every action you take is unpredictable.

Cthulhu done right. A co-op game that feels like a battle to survive overwhelming odds.  The cards, various chars, and different elder gods allow for unique games through multiple plays.  Rules can be a bit much, but an experienced player can handle it.

I didnt know killing monsters was this fulfilling! Arkham Horror makes for a good die-chucking, rpg-ish boardgame that looks complicated enough for my tastes (love all those game pieces) but surprisingly easy to play and teach!

Battling the Ancient Ones and their welcoming party has made us interested in the Cthulu mythos. Owner Paul will most likely get the game expansions soon, but not till we grind out 10 more plays at least, maybe more. Great stuff!

Being a Lovecraft fan i really wanted to like this game more than i do. Whilst it can be fun it can also be extremely long and tedious. Far too random overall. Flawed rules make it near impossible for players to lose if not stupid and have enough patience. The amount of rules interpretation required by the player is dissapointing (somewhat improved by reading the faq, in typical ffg style this was a case of release game now, clarify and balance rules later).

Frustrated Lawrence because of all the rules.  I also spent a lot of time referencing rules because it was our first time and there were a lot of rules.

This is my favorite co-op and one of the games that really let me know that I love board games.  I love working with the team and getting into the story of that indiviual game.  We like to play with a continuing story untill the character is killed.  The game has some  faults however.  It can take a little long and the small cards while needed are a bit crazy.  

Also if you are not following the rules to play correctly you may miss something and make the game way easier or harder.

Ok, I know that this game is not perfect. It can be long, have too many rules, is not so much cooperative as it promote itself, need lot of space, sometimes it maybe loosing atmosphere. All of it are good points, however for me this is still great game and I don't even have all expansions yet. First of all I need to say, that for me this is more survival, then cooperative game, but the coop still works for me good enough, when all the players will realize, that not all of them, will make it to the end and put the goal to win in front of they own survival. Also this game is not for players who are in rush to end it, this game is about enjoying the atmosphere and its really important how the people will approach this game. Role playing makes it more fun. And the best part is that each game is different.

Super thematic, great tension, interesting decisions to make throughout and rules that draw you into the feeling of the world rather than streamlining it too much to abstraction. Really though, it's not all that complicated, I'm not sure why a lot of people seem to think it is?

I've found that while I think it's a great game on it's own, the expansions, especially Kingsport, turn it into one of the best.

Fun game for sure. I can't say if it fully lives up to the hype as I've only played a few games. I wasn't bothered by the playtime or luck elements. There was enough ways to boost / mitigate dice rolls that we still felt like we had control over the game. Also, if you happen to have an iOS device, then picking up the AH app is a must. It's an app that deals with all the location card drawing and shuffling. Since you don't even need to take the location cards out of the box, this saves a ton of time.

5 / 5 - Great

Hokey horror fun for everyone! Clever design which limits (but doesn't eliminate) the impact of the co-op baggage (playing by rote, dictatorial players etc) at the cost of considerable complexity and administration overheads. Also has a big dose of game-plays-you rather than you-play-game but there's plenty of interesting risk management decisions to be made nevertheless. Generates fantastic tension and narrative but the theme feels more Buffy than Lovecraft with monsters swarming everywhere for our intrepid heroes to gun down. Challenging and fun played solo.

A creaking, groaning monster of theme, text, mechanics and tokens. A simple game disguised as a complex one, and mechanically full of crap things like 'miss a turn'. Despite all that it is excessive and glorious in its ability to crank out those moments in gaming which you'll talk about for years to come.

Never play with more than 5 people unless you like downtime big enough to play a separate filler game between your turns.

RATING: 6
Fails by taking far too long time to implement systems that aren't that interesting. Setup time is also a downer.

Being fair, the people that brought the game over didn't really know the rules (even though they had played more than a handful of times), so there were some capital mistakes that made the game boring.

Anyway, after having said that and reading the rules, I cannot see this game having far too much value for it's mechanics, it's all in the visual and text, it's all about the theme, and still, it takes far too long for a game that has theme, possibly as it's only strength.

Even so, as far as Talisman-inspired adventure games go, I'd say AH is the best.

Update - the game had become too easy so we picked up the Dunwich expansion.

RATING: 2
Went into this game with high enthusiasm. By two hours, I was yawning non-stop and hoping it'd end. Game ended early in the forth hour in a lost. I'm not saying its a bad game. Three of the six players expressed that they had an enjoyable time. Not me.

1. Down time.
2. Ridiculous bad-luck. I tried to strategise, plan, but unable to roll a "5" or "6" for the longest time. Imagine three hours of sitting there helpless. Even the most "walk-over" combat where I get to roll seven (7!) dice, I couldn't get a single "5" or "6". Tell me, how can anyone enjoy this game (session)?
3. Game mechanics make it take long time to accomplish anything meaningful. Close gate? 1 walk there, 2 go other world, 3 still in other world, 4 attempt to seal. Seal gate? 4   X to collect 5 clues. Collect clues? Wait for each mythos or kill monster (1 walk there) to collect 5 monster toughness (x5) to exchange (1 walk there; total = 6 turns). However, you're likely to need to heal your stamina or especially sanity as many monsters are physical resistant. So add about 3 turns for total 9.

"Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad."

Update: 3 » 2. Managed to be convinced into another game. Tried to be positive to the game and tried to enjoy it. Rolled much better this time round. However, the game is still overwhelmingly unengaging. The decision making time vs time required for execution is mind-numbingly long. I find myself having a much better time role-playing the time-travelling of Khronos than monster-fighting in Arkham Horror (Is that bad?). Someone has to give me a really good reason to play this game ever again. The time required for this psychological and mental torture, I'd rather sleep, or really, anything else.

One bad session of Arkham Horror could have been three awesome sessions of BattleLore (substitute with your favourite one hour game).

"Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again."

What can I say about Arkham Horror? How about: It's the most fun you can have getting your ass kicked by a diabolical board game. Arkham Horror is a lovely jaunt in to the world of H.P. Lovecraft and his successors. Featuring great artwork and excellent representations of the Cthulhu Mythos, Arkham Horror rates as one of the best atmospheric board games on the market.

It is, however, among the most dizzyingly complex board games ever made with more cards, tokens, and counters than you can shake a stick at.

(+ de parties non référencées)
noté en prenant les extensions en compte

Le plus gros défaut pour moi est la difficulté mal réglée du jeu : plus la partie avance, plus elle est simple à cause des portails scellés bloquant les invasions.
De plus la répartition très inégale des lieux d'ouverture de portail tend à augmenter les vagues de monstre et les blocages par scellé, donc ralentit l'avancée de l'échelle du GA.

Gros problème sur l'apparition du GA, seulement 11 lieux instables dont certains très rares, si par exemple 5 scellés + 3 portails ouverts et échelle GA à 7 ou 8, il ne reste que 3 lieux possibles, donc si l'échelle du GA est à 12 ou 13 par exemple, il n'y a presque aucune chance qu'il apparaisse de cette manière. L'échelle de terreur devrait compenser ce problème, hors elle augmente trop peu (à peu de joueurs surtout, et sans rumeur particulière ou autre mécanisme optionnel).
=> l'irruption de portail des extensions est une fausse correction, car (officiellement) l'échelle du GA n'avance pas, donc ça rallonge seulement la partie.
=> au contraire les cartes mythe avec double avancée de l'échelle de GA (à la place d'une ouverture de portail) est une meilleure idée. mais ça réduit les vagues de monstres donc ralentit l'avancée de la terreur.

This is a game I've played on my own several times, and with small groups of friends. It can be played with 8 players but it makes it into a very long game.

This game is beautifully atmospheric and drips with Cthulu theme as the investigators cooperate to try to close and seal gates and slay (and avoid) monsters.  Meaty, like a good hearty stew  - if only the game didn't take so long (budget on 4 hours + per game).

If playing solo, I'd rather use the Vassal boardgaming module then bother unloading all the pieces.  In fact, I highly recommend that anyone considering this game first either play in person, or test it via the Vassal app (both PC and Mac compatible)

As with most games with a reasonable level of complexity, plays better with more experienced players – who can help share the rules load.

While Cthulu is a great thematic universe,  here the implementation it isn't tied well enough to the mechanics for my liking.  There seems to be a lot of errand running.   And honestly, I doubt that a bunch of investigators could serious take on an old one.  

I get that this is an adventure game of story telling, but I'd much rather have a more open ended story arrangement such as Tales of the Arabian Nights, or something more focused like the Relic implementation of Talisman.  Or a Cthulu game with a much more personal encounter with terror (as the Cthulu books I've read have conveyed).

RATING: 5.5
Good theme; can be interesting in a large group if the personalities are right (but that has little to do with the game, really); usual Fantasy Flight goofy rulebook (though far from the worst); long, really quite long; it can be quite abstract.

It's not clear where the game is here: your turn might last 30 seconds, after which you'll endure a 20 minute wait for more action (in, for example, a 5 player game). Decision points are arbitrary or obvious: the game often seems to happen to you. Often, you'll spend several turns making no decisions whatsoever (e.g. once you've gone through a gate or end up in the asylum).

It's an awful lot of effort to enact a pretty static "story."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good: 
Great components. 

The theme is conveyed while exploring the city by encounters, locations, and monsters. It feels like the characters are in a Cthulhu world trying to uncover an ancient evil.

The game is pretty well balanced. We win some we lose some but we always had fun.

Bad: 
Games have improved in mechanics and pacing since this was released. It is just a little bit too slow and too long to be something that will ever end up hitting the table anymore.

Summary of negative points I’ve seen in other poster’s comments:

Takes too long.
No seriously, too long. 
Lots and lots and lot and lots of rules.
Not many real choices. 
Lots of luck (though here I’m not sure how much I agree when you can plan for dice roll odds). 

Summary of the positive points I’ve seen in other poster’s comments:
Co-op game
Fun theme
Role playing aspect

My conclusions
What theme, what roleplaying? I must have missed something entirely. You move around, you do what the card says, you roll some dice. Next. 

I don’t mean to belittle it because I’m fine with dice fest stuff, but I find you really get 2 plays: either you win very quickly by closing all gates, or you take forever and have the showdown with the monster. There might be some tension there, but it’s just not enough. 

And goodness you need a large area to play the thing in the first place. I like the idea, but I think I might need to see some of the expansions as well, but I don’t think I ever will because I have so many other games that play faster, easier to learn (and teach) and with as much fun factor (or more).

If you're up for a dice-fest with a good theme, this game is pretty fun. Also pretty fun drinking game. It's a social game, so play with people you want to talk to and use it as an excuse to sit around the table (BIG TABLE). If you want an intense/thoughtful game look elsewhere

I played this for the first time last night.  I enjoyed the system for the most part, with the exception that the length of individual game turns could be non-existent (if lost in time and space) to quite long so it felt a little unbalanced in this respect.  Having said that, as long as we allow an entire evening for it then this wouldn't matter quite so much as the gameplay is interesting enough as a co-operative game to see what your fellow players are doing.

The best cooperative game I have ever played. No matter how skilled a player is, the game still can surprise you and it can be quite challenging. That's why it is fun even after dozens of plays.

Arkham Horror is one of those love/hate masochistic games that my friends and I used to grind on weekend after weekend. It's theme supports the fact that it is a board game designed to be tough, almost punishing, to beat. I love Co-Op games too and this was perfect for my friends who were looking for a deep gaming session of teamwork against the odds.

I’ve played this one a few times solo and have enjoyed it very much.  I’ve also had two plays with a buddy of mine and we barely managed to win one of them.  It was quite challenging and the final battle was truly an edge of your seat affair.  Haven’t found this kind of experience in any other game so far.  The only downside I’ve found is the lengthy set up and break down time.  Ultimately I think that's a small price to pay for a game that offers the variety and depth that Arkham Horror does.

While it certainly is an interesting game, it has two "technical" problems. First, it takes so much space with hundreds of components, I can barely play it in solitaire mode, not to mention a game with 3-4 players - I think a game designer should consider such things. Second, it takes a lot of time - and this doesn't really encourage people to play it. If it was a little more dynamic and had "smarter" (less space-consuming) components, I'd give it a higher rating.

Epic gameplay,but you gotta have a PhD in Arkham to understand all the fiddly rules well enough to implement them appropriately. I'd play this game all the time if I didn't need the memory space in my brain for other little things like remembering my kids' names or how to tie my shoes. I play this once a year or so because it takes 3 hours to play and requires a weekend game workshop to review the rules and and teach other players. Still, playing this game can be an extremely immersive thematic experience. To recap: Awesome game. LONG and high-maintenance, but awesome.

An excellent ameritrash game, while seemingly complex, it is actually very simple and enjoyable though an admittedly polarizing game that sends some of my gaming group fleeing at the mere mention of it while others request it. A longish game that runs 2-4 hours which may not be for everyone but is my personal favorite.

This game has many small flaws, but the theme makes it worth playing. The length, however, makes us hard to get to the table. Also, newer, similarly themed games tend to have the same "feel" but are much shorter. I would prefer those if I didn't already own this.

Any imperfections this game might have, and it does have some, are completely covered up for me by the fact that it is DRIPPING with mood and theme. Its also cooperative, which is uncommon, and more adventure based in that cooperation than LoTR or Shadows over Camelot. Great for my LARP and RPG buddies. But, you have to have set aside hours in which to play it. You have to understand that its random and can be difficult to win; and well.. it can be a bit fidly. If you are a horror geek, its still worth the ride! It would have scored higher if I had more time for 3+ hour games.

This is a great game that fulfills my RPG/Lovecraft itch.  While it does have a long setup and a lot of shuffling, it pales in comparison to the setup and fiddling of a real RPG campaign.  I find it more enjoyable than "Tales of Arabian Nights" because it feels like there is a known purpose, rather than the random wandering of TAN.  I would suggest this game for 1~4 players to keep it manageable.  The short encounters have some good flavor for stories and the artwork for the bits and pieces is great.

Look, I can see how people like this game.  But it's not for me.  I don't like the fiddly bits.  I don't care for the way you have to go about things.  Not a huge fan about the length, or the things you have to keep track of or the fact that it just...sometimes...drags.

I have friends who love the thing, and I'll play it with them.  I'll get into it and everything.  Set the mood with the music, with everything else.

But if you look at the rest of the games I REALLY like, you'll see that this isn't the game for me.  I like the filler games, the abstract games.  This is neither of those.

Wow.  I am really impressed with the rules for this game, which make what could be a vicious muddle into something far more clear-cut and playable.  That being said, the game is clearly an 80's design and takes a huge chunk of time to play.  All things considered, I'd place this as a 'sometimes' game.

Arkham Horror is the poster boy for the sentiment "a great theme doesn't make a great game."

The theme is terrific.  The game is practically nonexistent--your choices boil down to "do I want to go to Area A and have something random happen, or do I want to go to Area B and have something random happen?"  Add a soul-crushing amount of bookkeeping to make things even less fun.

You want theme?  In the time it takes to play a short game of Arkham Horror, you can read three or four of Lovecraft's stories.  In the time it takes you to play a long game, you can read all of "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath."  It'll be way more fun, trust me.

I gave this game away to a buddy on two conditions: one, he never ask me to play it.  Two, no backs.

Rules: Arcane
Setup time: Monstrous
Play time: Aeons
Fun: Endless void
Strategy level: Chaotic
Condition of player after a game: Gibbering and insane

Lovecraft would be proud.

Rating falls from a 3 to a 2 because I realized that the only reason I would ever play this again is if everybody else wanted to and they needed me to make up a minimum number of players.  Then I remembered that this can be played solitaire...

A lot of fun, but mostly it's a wild pile of components. Amazing numbers of cards, tokens, bits and pieces, so it takes a while to set up especially with the expansions. Can get quite tense, though, and end in misery (for the investigators).

I like the idea of the cooperation game versus the system.  Downtime for each player is not long at all - which is important in a long game like this.

want to play again now that I have some idea of what is going on.

I think I've rated this game fairly. I like Arkham Horror but it's not one to just pick up and play. You need to be in the right mood, with the right people and be prepared for a long game with a number of components and variables to keep track of. Saying that, when all elements click, this game is an unforgettable experience with all players running around trying to deal with monsters and gates that seem to pop up with no end; while at the same time trying not to 'die' and also improve your character to deal with situations more effectively as they come up. Don't play this game if you're looking for strategy, impeccably balanced mechanics, calculating moves, cost-benefit analysis, bluffs etc. You play this game because it brilliantly creates a tense sense of drama and looming doom - and no matter if in the end you win or loose, you'll all be left with a satisfying feeling of having encountered something truly other-worldly and lived to tell the tale. Beats watching a movie!

One of my greatest surprises in 2005 was how well Arkham Horror was redone.  The new game is splendid and reaffirms the heavy theme of the original, but with vastly superior rules and components.  It is a cooperative game that forces players to work together very well and the board can light up and with concerted effort be brought under control just to flare again.  Madness is everywhere...  Play it.

Okay - let me explain.  I am not a Cthulhu fanatic.  I recently tried the RPG and I must say it was an absolute blast.  The gradual depletion of sanity is hilarious.  Therefore, I am glad I tried this board game version and I could see how people very interested in the mythos/world would love it.

There would have been a time this game would have been adored by my group. But that time was approx 20 years ago.  As such Talisman still remains my pick for all things nostalgia.

The game is quite long and there is quite a bit of downtown esp in a 5  player game.  

In the game I played the Big Horror made his way to Arkham and in turn the final 1/2 hr boiled down to pure dice rolling.  This left me quite dissatisfied and I certainly don't mind a long game!

Fun for an occasional play but I doubt I will be adding this to my collection.

Theme heavy adventure game with the great balancing act of fighting monsters/closing gates/upgrading characters. Very long setup, occupies every possible horizontal surface, but the experience well worth it.
Since it's a co-op, it works with any advertised number of players.
Despite the theme it's one of the favorites of my 7 years old, so I would say it's recommended for some children with the proper narration.

I really like this game more than my rating shows.  I wasn't previously a fan of HPL or the whle Cthulu thing, but the theme/art/design/production value in AH are excellent and really get you into the game. The Co-op play works great and the game is just the right amount of tough, you really have to work together to beat this game.  Again I'm docking points for what probably isn't the game's fault: It's hard to  get people to play this a second time.

Edit 11/20/09: I'm dropping this because although I like it well enough, I really do need to be in the right mood to play this type of game.

It could go from 8 to 9, depending on the group.  I believe that with some practice, it'll probably move to 9. Using the play aids. Great atmosphere game, team play, lots of dice rolling. Depending on the luck of the draw, your game can be easier or much tougher.It represents Arkham very well, or the feeling of being in an horror movie. Stuff happens, and you do your best to survive and stop the horror from growing. Great writings, I really like it.

I usually dislike rolling dice, but with a strong Cthulhu-theme and nice cooperative nature this is a very enjoyable game.

Hmm, I'm torn about this game.  I really like the theme and I usually enjoy cooperative games, but this one hasn't really clicked yet.  I think like it will be a lot more enjoyable if we could all get sucked into the theme a bit more strongly.  I am worried, however, that there aren't enough meaningful decisions, and it will mainly become an "experience" rather than a "game".  I'm excited to play it again (hopefully with a larger group of people), and it still has a good chance of winning me over.

Dripping with theme that all the mechanics go towards supporting. Can be a bit long and sometimes you feel like you're just going through the motions.

Just received, but no play yet. The components overall are stunning, both in appearance and physical quality. I think the board in the original game was cheesier, but better looking -- this one is rather dark. Regardless of how the game plays, this one might be irresistible for the Lovecraft fans (like me!). Anyway, for less than $35 from Boulder Games, I don't see how you can go wrong.

Edit: I've played numerous times now. It's fun for people who like the topic, and don't mind the fiddly play. It's pretty process heavy for a lighter game. It's not something I'd like to play all the time, but I can be talked into it. (as long as I don't have to set it up) I played the original quite a bit years ago, but there are so many better games out now, even better Lovecraft themed games.

I don't think the randomness detracts from it at all, given the horror genre. One would think there would be a bit of uncertainty in such a world as this.

I picked this up for myself after playing it back when it came out. I hated it then, but the request of my group pushed me into making a swap for it here on BGG. Contrary to popular belief, setup is a lot easier than I remember (thanks 2008 Revision) and the game played a lot smoother than I remembered. I would say that this is a game you have to study before playing. We actually keep the Wiki up on my laptop as we play just in case something weird comes up.  You will do a lot of legwork in this game--setup included--to lose 90% of the time.  But when you do win, how sweet it is.

A very good coop game that does a wonderful job with the subject matter.  You'll have to power through the rulebook a bit, but download the excellent flow chart, and it will all fall into place.  It looks a lot more daunting than it really is.

Components are great, (Make a bunch of those paperclip stand-up holders so you can see the gates and monsters better.)  Tons of items and options.  This is one of the few games that I left out on the table after playing the first time, since I wanted to play it again as soon as I could.

The time to play is a little long, but you will be so immersed in the story that the time will fly by.

One of the games that combines roleplaying with a boardgame.  It pits the players against the game and they pretty much have to cooperate or they will lose.  The flavor text for the cards add to the tension.

I love this game. It is stock full of theme, is always intense and close, and is fully co-op, so the wife loves it as well. Enjoy (and own) all the expansions as well. Love everything about it! Except the set-up/take down time...

All investigators, AO's, and other cards (heralds, player count, etc) laminated.

Monsters/investigators taped to last longer

Game in a Nutshell: Cooperative game of running around Arkham City, and into other dimensions, to live out events as read off cards, build up character stats, and fight evil monsters by way of dice.

Played as: Solo, 2 player

Pros: Creative text, excellent artwork, and the best integration of theme of any game I've played makes this feel like you're living out a story rather then playing through a game. Cooperating, instead of competing, is a good change of pace because when you're down on your luck, you can still find ways to help out 'the team' (that's a big plus in a game that can last as long as this). And finally, if you can't find someone to play with, you can play by yourself.

Cons: Hands down the hardest game I've ever tried to learn how to play. You have my pity if you're learning this game on your own like I did. The game can be fiddly with so much stuff to remember at any given point it's easy to let it all overshadow one's ability to focus on the story (This wains with experience, but may come back if played infrequently). The biggest downfall is the game-length can take even experienced players as many as four hours (more if you're learning). Because of that, I've rated it where I have since it's a hard game to suggest.

Other: It took me three games before I could get it played under 4 hours (the first was over 7). The difference was how much I had to wade through the rules. Because of all that I think I've learned it's best just to play, make your best guess about the rules, write down questions, and keep playing. Save the rules deciphering for post game, because chances are the game can be enjoyable even when not played entirely correct, but can be a drag with excessive rule-searching down-time.

More Other: My feelings for this game took a big hit as soon as I played Tales of the Arabian Nights. I does everything AH did best (theme, creative text, storytelling) and does it so much better. All that without the excessive game length, nit-picky rules, or relative inaccessibility. I've traded the game away with the only fear of missing it as a solo experience.

Best Use: Played as an planned event or solo.

Took a while to learn how to play even with one of use having read the whole book before.  3 people played WE WON!!  I really like the setting and felt that after we have played a few more times we would have the rules down.  Do they make turn list check sheets?

RATING: 7
A good game but as with most co-op games exceedingly difficult.  Before picking this one up I would recommend playing a fair share of shorter co-ops and make sure you are used to/like the idea of a difficult game that wins more than you do, because it's a harder pill to swallow when you have a couple hours invested in a game as opposed to thirty minutes.

A very very good cooperative game, works well with 2-4 players atleast, thats what I have tested it with. Needs pretty much knowledge about english, but once you get the cards right, they arent impossible to remember, not counting the encounter cards. 

Takes a long time to play, but is still pretty intensive. Loads of things to do, and more often than not, you feel like you need to accomplish more than you can in one turn, so you need to prioritize your actions a lot.

A nicely themed game, but really there isn't a lot of game in there. I enjoy playing Arkham Horror, but sometimes it's risk management and luck if you win. The setup is quite long, lots of decks of cards and counters, not to mention the new big box expansions. However, it isn't a short game, so the setup is worth it.
Played this a lot a few years ago, not seen the gaming table in a while - once or twice for each new expansion.

Fue mi primer juego y sin duda el más amortizado. Es un juego con una producción magnífica y que quita muy bien el mono de rol. Mucha sensación de estar viviendo una historia. No obstante, el setup es muy largo, depende de que los jugador lo vivan mucho y no tiene una enorme cantidad de decisiones. Es importante disfrutar con el proceso y no con las decisiones.

RATING: 7
Arkham Horror es un juego de tablero colaborativo ambientado en las novelas y relatos cortos de H.P. Lovecraft. Los jugadores deberán de ponerse deacuerdo y trabajar duro para evitar que un endiablado ser primigenio se materialice en Arkham y con ello acabe con la raza humana. Los monstruos representan las criaturas y seres de otros mundos que aparecen en los relatos de Lovecraft. Te recomendaría leerte el relato "La noche de los tiempos", donde aparecen los pólipos volantes y la Gran Raza y te sorprenderías de la cantidad de cosas que el juego representa con completa fidelidad. Estamos acostumbrados por culpa de muchas peliculas de terror adolescente a que los monstruos son con cuatro extremidades, o en su defecto, sueltan babas y tienen ojos de gato o reptil... por poner un ejemplo. El terror que empleaba Lovecraft y en lo que fue, sencillamente, un auténtico genio, fue en darle a las criaturas de sus relatos un aspecto totalmente desconocido, e incluso primitivo. Incluso más desconocido y extraño para la razón humana. Ellos fueron los Primigenios, ellos son los auténticos supervivientes de este y otros mundos. Ellos están aquí desde los tiempos. Y quizá su aspecto no ha evolucionado como la raza humana debería esperar. Recuerda el nombre: pólipo. Su aspecto es el de un gran tonel esponjoso, totalmente primitivo, sin evolucionar... el terror está en que ellos si han evolucionado, pero en otro aspectos... e incluso experimentaron con los seres unicelulares y crearon al hombre por error... ¿porqué vamos a esperar que tengan ojos (es decir, que tengan más "descubrir" que un ghul) si ellos no se dedican a ir cazando a diestro y siniestro? Eso sí, que no te enganche ninguno, porque te cruje. Vamos, resumiendo, es pura recreación del mundo de los Mitos. Y el juego es bastante fien es ese sentido.
Al igual que pasa con el juego de rol, aquí no se incentiva los combates, sino cómo derrotar los monstruos sin que salgas muy mal parado. El combate es sencillo: le plantas cara al monstruo. Si no te da un ataque de locura, intentas darle la ostia. Pero si fallas, no te vas de rositas.
Arkham es un juego totalmente configurable. Es más, el autor original del juego recomienda que cada grupo adapte reglas del manual o incluso añada nuevas según sus necesidades. Hay reglas para hacer a los monstruos letales, reiniciando el juego con nuevos personajes. Incluso hay un programa con el que te puedes crear tu propio personaje e imprimirlo tal y como las fichas de los jugadores. Es decir, hay todo un abanico de posibilidades para adaptar el juego a los gustos y necesidades del grupo.
Considero que si no te llama nada la temática lovecraftiana este juego te pasará totalmente desapercibido. En cambio, a la gente que nos encanta los relatos del escritor de Providence, nos parece una auténtica pasada. Han conseguido hacer un juego de tablero lo suficientemente profundo como para representar el ambiente de terror de las novelas de Lovecraft. Y encima, funciona por sí solo. Los monstruos se mueven solos, los sucesos van hilando una historia...
Mi opinión personal es que Arkham es un juego que requiere 2 o 3 partidas para acabar de integrar todas sus reglas, pero una vez hecho, gana mucho. Está claro que ni de lejos va a reemplazar una partida de rol, pero no creo que ese fuera el caso de los creadores de juego. La idea, básicamente, es que los jugadores colaboren entre sí para solucionar los problemas que se le plantean. En mi opinión, como amante de juegos de mesa, le daría un merecido 8 porque se le nota que es un juego muy trabajado en cuanto a la mecánica. Además visualmente es acojonante y permite una rejugabilidad muy sorprendente (nunca jugarás 2 partidas iguales). El trasfondo ambiental está muy logrado. Y la novedad de que los jugadores no compiten entre sí, sino contra el tablero, para mí fue nuevo.
Puntos negativos:
No es un juego para jugar pensando en la hora en la que tienes que acabar, porque te puede llevar de 2 a 3 horas acabar una partida.
El trasfondo es un aliciente pero también una losa para aquellos jugadores que no les mola las novelas de lovecraft o simplemente, prefieren matar bichos.
Tantos componentes en la mesa acaban mareando a los jugadores.
Requiere un estudio concienzudo de las reglas y el tablero. No es un juego para jugar deprisa y corriendo.
Lecturas recomendadas de relatos muy cortos por órden de preferencia (muchos está en la red):
"La declaración de Randolph Carter" <- terror en estado puro.
"En la noche de los tiempos"
"La sombra sobre Innsmouth"
"La llamada de Cthulhu"
"El ceremonial"
"El horror de Dunwich" <- Muchas localizaciones del tablero parten de este relato, así como algunos aliados como el Dr. Henry Armitage
"Los que vigilan desde el tiempo"

RATING: 5
I think my rating for this will go up when the game finally beats us.  

July 2012-My rating for this has not gone up.  This might be me, might be my group, might be the game, but there is something about this game as an experience that I just can't stand.  We have some friends that enjoy this game a lot and so i would agree to play it with the group for them.  It got to the point where my boyfriend told me he would prefer if I played video games or did something I would enjoy more while they played because he could just feel my non enjoyment rolling off of me.  And I tried to like this game.  

Co-op as a genre isn't my favorite though, so that might have something to do with it.  But I dislike this game more than the average co-op

Played twice with a group of 5, but it seemed kind of monotonous and fiddly. While I generally like adventure games (I like Runebound a lot), I just couldn't get into the spirit of this one. It really just felt like "move somewhere, roll a die, move somewhere else, roll a die". I've tried playing it solo a couple of times, but aborted after the first few turns when an uncontrollable feeling of boredom and not wanting to deal with the fiddliness came over me. I really wanted to like it, but for some reason I don't.

With all the expansions and the strange eons program this game becomes a toolkit for any scenario you can conceive of within the mythos.

RATING: 10
I have revised my rating of all things Arkham Horror to a 10. That's right. I did it. The madness overtook me, and I like it. I could entertain the argument that, purely on mechanics, this is not a 10. But this is an experience game for me, one that generates great narratives and leaves me spent and exhilarated and eager to play again.

My only complaint--and I mean only--is that the end game seems anticlimactic when the enemy awakens and you fight it. I'd actually prefer to win or lose based on whether the Old One awakens, but of course that would require some tweaking. I know, I know, you smartass, there's an Old One who wins automatically if he/she/it wakes up.

The buildup is great. Lots of table talk, lots of cool cards, lots of cool events, lots of equipment, lots of choices, the time really flies by and a good group makes this game lots of fun. If you really get into the theme and have fun with your character, you will have fun playing this game and watching a very tense narrative unfold. If you are that kind of player, you must play this game. If it didn't take so much time and table space to set up, mega Arkham with all the expansions would likely be my favorite gaming experience.

I can't believe how much table space this requires, especially with the expansions. Yikes!

The rules do seem fiddly when you read them. But the game is actually fairly easy to pick up once you get going. Don't delay--play it!

I have played this thrice now with all the expansions, and it is truly a mind-altering experience. Utter madness. Sheer, howling death on a velvet platter crafted in Hell and hand-delivered by a murderous, nymphomaniac lovebot more or less shaped like Jessica Alba. Yes, it is that good. You should crawl into its embrace, sniff its bloodied glove and beg it to devour you. Go now.

The fellows at "Shut Up, Sit Down" described it as "an H.P. Lovecraft story-telling engine," which is rather a brilliant summation. This is almost a roller-coaster in terms of player agency, but it almost condenses a lengthy CoC role-playing experience into only 4 hours. A demented masterpiece.

I began completely in love with this game. Then after a year of playing it every so often the shine started to fade a bit. Then eventually I got to this point where it just seems too long and too many pieces of different sizes to manipulate in ratio to how fun it is. There are several co-op games I enjoy much more than this one.

The theme though is fantastic and I do love a decent Lovecraft skin.

The game is longer than I'd usually like, and that drags down my rating of it somewhat, but the individual elements of it are mostly fun.  I think I'm too much of a team player to enjoy the individual win component.  Particularly when the game seems quite challenging as a team without adding in that trade-off. But I do enjoy co-op games, and that's probably my favourite thing about it.

An EXCELLENT film noir-style horror adventure game that really sucks you into the theme and the story itself! Characters can go insane or just end up dead, whiskey can be drank to avoid losing sanity and you can get arrested for carrying the whiskey around the town and what not! Playtime for this co-operative game is usually around 3-4h.

RATING: 7.5
I love it.  A game that forces you to press your luck and adapt to difficult situations the entire way through.  Not only do different character/skill pairings create specialized roles, but each character's role will change drastically throughout the game as their resources and health grow and diminish.

That said, it is so devastating to risk everything and wrestle through this game for 3 hours to reach a moment where something catastrophic occurs and all our progress is undone.  More often than not, we disregard the rules in such cases and throw out nasty mythos cards in order to persevere and reach the ending that we've "earned."  The game requires too much investment to let bad luck ruin it in the end.  I don't like playing a game that makes me want to cheat rather than take the loss like a man.

But it's a cooperative game, so as long as we all agree that our cheating is justified, a good time is had by all.  Isn't that what matters?

This is a game that I love deeply for the theme and general gameplay premise of investigators adventuring for clues. Each element is well-matched to the theme, and I love FFG's slightly cartoon-ized version of Lovecraft's worlds. Each expansion adds, sometimes quite literally, a new dimension to the game. The way you can adopt pieces of each expansion for your game, mixing and matching to find the right balance for your group from the vast library of expansions both large and small, brings this game to an excellent rating of 9.

What drops it a full point from 10 is the tedium. While the game at times feels like a big, cog-ridden grandfather clock that you gleefully watch tick away while you try to save Arkham, it also sometimes feels like you get into a rhythm, with your teammates, effectively controlling the board, and still have to play for hours to complete it. In this way it has a slight fatigue element, and it seems the only way to fix it is to house-rule it so as to remove elements and obstacles, thus reducing difficulty. It is a tough balance, but this is what keeps Arkham from being perfect, and stops my group from playing it, and sends us to other boardgames, or Call of Cthulhu RPG.

Great thematic game. Very time consuming. If you have time and the players, great way to spend an afternoon.

People often consider this game to be one of the end-all-be-all of board gaming. I can't say I agree. If I had my choice of games that took as long as this one does, Through the Ages is the game of choice. 

I feel its length and non-evolving game play keep it from penetrating a greater audience. It's a shame due to it's rich fantasy. This is the main reason why it receives the score I've given it. 

If only this game was shorter and had the ability to allow newcomers into its rich lore... Oh wait -- Elder Sign is now available :p

First, it screams the theme. The text in the cards is great, the art on the board and on the cards are beautiful. The problem is there is not much interaction/cooperation, everyone is desperate trying to seal some gates (which is maybe the intention of the game designer) or kill monster by themselves. Still, the game is complete randomness. Is good because everytime you play a completely different game, but luck plays a way too strong role in such a complex game. And you have only a limited number of real choices to interfere in the game (walk / adjust the stats / spend a clue to re-roll). Still, the game is really FUN to play. Recommended.

RATING: 8
One of the few games that my wife will actively request. She detests simple games and long AP-prone competitive games (she does like Glory to Rome and Brass though...).

We usually play with just two human players (us) but 2 or 3 investigators per person, for a total of 4 or 6. We found that having just one per person means that you might not really be doing much in a round. We could see playing with a third human and 2 investigators each, but that's probably about it.

With more players we'd rather play Betrayal at House on the Hill.

Without a doubt a top 5 among co-ops, and a good game all over. The Cthulhu Mythos are very well implemented through both the mechanisms and the art.

I really like this one, I doubt they could have translated into a good board game any better than they did. The fact that you can play it alone is nice too, so if you have nothing on a given afternoon... however, while it plays 1-8 players, it's better with 3 to 5(maybe even a 6th, especially if you're using one of the board expansions).

RATING: 8
Cooperative, survival-horror game based off of Lovecraft. What's not to love?

I've played it 5ish times, but each time with a different group (so going through the rules each time). Apart from the long time it takes to teach the rules, I've had a great time with this game with each group. It's probably the game I look forward to playing the most, but it's hard to find people (and the time) to play it with me.

Overwrought, incredibly fiddly... a hybrid adventure/rpg boardgame that FFG has become known for.  

Recommended if you like this type of game and can appreciate the chaotic, random elements, game narrative and the mechanics of the game.  Otherwise avoid.  Way too long for the amount and quality of gameplay imo.

Good thematic elements if you're a Cthulhu fan.

Played once. One player. Blew away Cthulhu pretty easily in a very anti-climactic final battle. Very disappointed. I guess I just will never like co-operative games.  I like games because I can outguess or outplay my opponents. In co-op games there is none of that.  It all just seems so meaningless.  We all win or we all lose...who cares.

If you like the atmosphere of H.P.Lovecraft's stories, you will like the atmosphere of this game - it picks it up perfectly! The mechanics is not too complex, yet offers very rich playing experience with medium strategic choices. The artwork is truly stunning! Due to inherent randomness, some 30% of games tend to be a complete miss - it could be a too easy win, too brutal a defeat, or a game could drag for 10 moves, never really getting anywhere. The replay value is immense - we've probably had like a hundred games so far (with the expansions). All in all, one of the best games in my collection.

I didn't think I would like co-op. Crushing my enem..opponent gives me so much satisfaction and who has to admit his defeat to me in such a game?

(020914) Arkham Horror is an odd bird in my collection. I rarely play it, since it takes a very long time. The game feels good (and having all your chits and bits in compartments helps with the setup), conveys an excellent HPL-feel and even though the rules are rather opaque, they are functional. Perhaps the reason I feel so strongly for this game is because I've done a lot of roleplaying in my past?

(311014) I've been on a real Arkham kick lately, playing up to two games a day and taking it on another spin today (of course with Innsmouth). I feel that the BGG additives really help with the rules - especially the wonderful flowchart. The game, at its best is really thematic, wonderfully engaging and really feels like an adventure in the town of Arkham. At it's worst it's nothing but a punishing chit-fest that forces you to redraw an investigator every two turns because you only seem to draw Mythos cards that spawn monsters and encounters that kill off investigators with no chance of averting them. The score of 8 still holds - it's a blast when it works, it's spiteful when it doesn't.

I was initially wary of this game - a long, cooperative effort did not seem too appealing, but once I sat down and got into it I was hooked.

I look forward to playing this classy adventure game again.

Just the base game can keep you occupied a while.  If you can learn to cope with the tornado of fiddliness that this game evokes there is a real jewel of insanity underneath.  A winner for adventure games fans or Lovecraftians.  The player aids/flowcharts in the file section are a must!  This game is especially fun if you play with someone who has the rules internalized and can "run" the game while everyone else enjoys the ride.  Rating assumes you're toughening it up a little with the official RL variants or an expansion.

Beware the flood of expansions. . .until the base game becomes too easy for you.

A number of solo plays with varying numbers of characters. Excellent components as per usual with Fantasy Flight. Last play was with Dunwich, Dark Pharaoh, and Yellow King. I can't say I was overly thrilled with it. While I don't think the game necessarily needs to be longer in terms of playing time, I wish that there were more opportunities for availing one's self of things like the deputy or gang memberships, etc., which hardly ever come into play--that really detracts from the richness of the game and makes the setup all the more annoying.

I'm not sure why I don't enjoy this as much as I should. I never feel like I'm immersed in the storyline for some reason.

I think you really need to play this with the max amount of players to get that full feeling.

RATING: 6
Improve your investigator, pass skill checks and combat monsters to prevent the Great Old One from rising.

Plays: A couple.
Type: Thematic cooperative game – a theme-driven game where you play together against the game.
Complexity: Heavy cooperative game.
# of players: 1.
Playing time: Several hours.
Player interaction: Best played solo. Otherwise cooperation. 
Randomness: High – dice and card and tile draw with high impact and little control.

Replayability: Decent for solitaire. It’s a long and very random game. You play it to enjoy the ride. Those that enjoy the ride will probably want to play again. There are many different investigators and Great Old Ones, so each game will be a little bit different from the beginning.
Fun: Sure. The bastardized Lovecraft world is a fun place. Combating ancient evil is fun. Drawing cards is exciting, they are often high impact and you draw lots of them. Going insane from mythos exposure is fun and thematic. 
Memorability: Decent. All the random stuff happening comes together to tell a story. You're not just managing resources, you're desperately trying to save the world!

Thematic integration: Very good. This is designed theme first.  It's a bastardized Lovecraft theme, as in most games. The Lovecraft stories are more often about things not seen, while the game has you combat monsters directly.
Components: Decent. I would have liked plastic monster figures, but there are lots of cards and chits and producing the game with minis would probably have made it prohibitively expensive. The art is standard horror stuff. The box is heavy, you feel you get your money's worth.
Expansions: Definitely get Dunwich Horror for improved variety and the madness and injury cards (lasting effects of insanity and unconsciousness). It bugged me that the base game lets investigators shrug off temporary insanity.

Who will like this: Gamers that have plenty of time, like the theme and play for the experience more than for the outcome. Probably best solitaire.

Fun game.

Only problem with this is that the rules were written by Fantasy Flight.

Fantasy Flight rules:  Explain one concept in contradictory ways among several non-consecutive pages, and among these pages leave out necessary instructions on how the rule operates correctly...put that part of the rule in with the pictured example example, but leave it out of the rule explanation completely.

Fantasy Flight does this ALL the time in every game they produce.

RATING: 9.25
This game is deliciously complicated, in an eldritch way.  The fact is, this game requires a LOT of time set aside; a series of gamers who thrive on complexity; and people willing to very probably lose to the game's intense enemies. I read all of Lovecraft's content and enjoyed the general presentation and ideas... and while the game does a good job of capturing many aspects of the set-dressing I enjoyed so much, the playability issues (requiring at least 2 different "quick" reference sheets) means it sat for a very long time without being played.  Sold, it was.

Good purely cooperative board game which can be played solo.  Extremely thematic, visually pleasing, and quite variable with different roles to play and baddies to fight.

The rules are a bit steep to learn -- mostly just the book-keeping though (when to move chit A or number X on chit B  plus number Y on sheet C means to roll Z dice). The game play itself is quite straight forward.  Having one person in charge of knowing these things and asking as a 'keeper' of sorts helps smooth things out.

Amellett, hogy baromi hangulatos, meg egész jól kitalált maga a játék, ugyanaz a bajom vele, mint úgy általában a többi ameris játékkal: 1-2 órán belül elérkezik az a pont, amikor a folyamatos kockadobálgatások és az 5-6-ra (sikeres dobásra) várás már agyoncsapja az egészet és onnantól számomra majdhogynem élvezhetetlen. Ezen a ponton túl már a történet is kezd hidegen hagyni, csak szörnyek és kockák és kapuk és az a rohadt sok kártya, amit már rég elfelejtettem, mi van nálam, mert már három órája ülök és csak dobálok.

A hangulata tök rendben van, meg az egész körítés. De tényleg. Csak az az istenverte, nyomorult kocka miatt az egész olyan, mint egy kaland-játék-kockázat könyv, amikor dobsz egy kockával, majd az alapján sérülsz, mész tovább, találsz valamit a helyszínen, támad meg szörny, stb, hogy mit dobtál.

Valakinek ez biztos marha izgalmas, én inkább euróznék helyette.

Inzertet kivettem, gyalázat.

Más most meg nem jut eszembe már, mert baromi késő van és úgy négy órát görnyedtem a táblája fölött kockavetős mantrákat morogva. Kérem, kapcsolja ki.

When I got this game I really loved it but it palled a little recently. It has a great 'feel' and is a lot of fun, but I found it really difficult to defeat the game and it does take a lot of set up and occupies a huge amount of space (especially with the Dunwich Expansion). Maybe if I gave it another shot I'd rate it higher.

I love this game, I really do, but it just takes so damn long...the setup and tear down time is a killer too.

I think our group tends to futz around too much before closing gates. The sense of urgency that comes later in the game needs to be there from the beginning. I'll play this more if we learn how to keep the games under 3 hours.

My wife fashioned a very ghetto, very functional, very awesome little cardboard caddy to hold all the cards. This will greatly reduce setup time, teardown time and reduce the amount of space it takes up.

I sold this. It had a high failure rate. For every good play of it, there were 2 long and frustrating plays where the game ran for 5 hours and everyone just wanted to be done with it.

RATING: 8
This game works only if you focus on the theme - read the flavor text on the cards, help construct a narrative as game events unfold, else it bogs down into three hours of seemingly meaningless token shuffling and dice rolling.

Recently picked up my own copy and have been playing it a lot with my son. Because it allows me to spend more time with him, and because we play it in the way noted above, we have a great time, and are even at a point where we can win it.
---------------------
Now playing this some with the kids in the gaming club. They seem to be just the right set of gamers to play this with - they have the right attitude, they have the right level of skill, and they are willing to treat this game in the way it deserves - as two or three hours of storytelling fun that climaxes in either triumph or insanity. The other day saw us fighting to the last man against Shub Nig, and as each of us fell beneath the black hooves of darkness and were consumed, we were cheering aloud, shouting and screaming, chanting "six-six-six-six" as dice were cast, and when we won, we were standing from our chairs, yelling and cheering, and giving each other hugs and high-fives. That's how good this game can be.

There are two big problems with this game:
1) It has about the same complexity as Pandemic
2) The game can often feel like it plays you, similar to Pandemic.  You might initially seem like you have a lot of choices, but there is really only 1-2 choices that you really should do.

This second thing is okay with Pandemic because the game lasts less than an hour, but Arkham Horror can take about 3-4.  If I am going to play a 3-4 hour game, I want to play a game where I actually make meaningful decisions.  I know a lot of people said that the theme is great, but the theme of a game carries little wait with me, so it did not help the situation.  I do want to play it again now that I actually know what I am doing, but I have a feeling it will produce the same results.

Great art. Playing pieces built to last. Construction of ALL components is simply amazing, actually. I wish all games were this well put together.

I actually rated this under 8 because it is so damned hard to find the amount of time between schedules (mine and friends) between our jobs and families to really sit down and get into it. BUT... when I have gotten into it is really great.

Basically, if you don't have the time to invest in it, you won't like it and look at is a waste. But if you are a fan of games, and Lovecraft this IS for you.

I used to own the original game but gave it away.  Almost straight after I bought the new version and whilst I have only played it a couple of times, I do like the attention to detail (reminds me of the lovingly designed Talisman and Dungeon Quest boardgames in that respect).

My only gripe is that it seems over-complicated in terms of the rules, which I found I was consulting ever turn...

One of my all-time favourite games!
Great theme, great game-play; you really feel the team effort.

Can be difficult to win if the cards conspire against you, and this can extend the game into many hours. Sometimes this can leave players feeling worn-out, especially if they still lose at the end of it all.

After 6 Games and the Dunwich-Expansion i realy love this game.
The theme is very well packed and (for our group) the difficulty is challenging.
The great variety of cards gives it a great replay value.

RATING: 2
The gameplay feels vacant.  There are optimal choices.  You can win the game as long as you don't act retarded.  Nothing to spice up the cooperative gameplay.  No traitors like Shadows over Camalot.  No opposition player like Fury of Dracula or Descent.  Just the same randomized game engine over and over.

I really like the Cthulhu theme, i don't like cooperative game so i play this game only with 2 or 3 player , with this number of player the game is short ( about 1h30 ) and very dynamic, i usually  play it with my friend ( 2 player game ) who has all the expansion set so at the beginning we choose with witch one and proceed to the game.
I suggest to play with only one big expansion and 1 or 2 little expansion depending on the experience of the players.
Good cooperative game for me.

After Eldritch horror came to the market i dont know if i will come back again to this game event if it is a realy good one.

I like this game, especially for the teamplay aspects of it. Basically everyone is running around doing their own thing and there is not much to do to help others but even with limited possibilities of working towards shared goal there is sense of losing or winning as a team.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Don't let the rule book scare you. It did take a long time to complete our 1st game (referring to the rule book constantly which I now see as a mistake), but after that it was easy. Just under 2 hours for our second game and each subsequent game has been 2 hrs or less.  

A suggestion to help speed things up in your few first games is to DISCARD AND REDRAW if you are confused by a card or monster and NEW PLAYERS DO NOT USE SPELLS. Also, understand and be OK with the fact that you will not get everything correct your first few plays....You will get it all correct in time 
 
If you do decide to invest your time in learning, then Arkham Horror will reward you with tons of fun. My wife had not ever heard of Cthulhu and is one of her favorite games now(she actually asks me to play). We love the atmosphere, creepy flavor text, the feel of moving through Arkham (like a book or movie).

RATING: 9
pretty much one of my most favorite games ever. the only problem with the game is that i don't know enough other players to play it with me regularly!

before i got on the geek i played this almost weekly with a good friend, the downside of that being that our games went on a bit longer because we always played a pair of investigators each (thus increasing the amount of time we spent planning out our actions). we still had lots of fun playing though, no questions about that!

after playing this game, i enjoyed it and the theme so much that i actually went out and bought an hp lovecraft book to read.

As a long time fan of Lovecraft I can't help but be attracted to AH. While the game doesn't quite manage to convey the Lovecraftian sense of creepiness it is still a great game. If played with a few people that can get into the roleplaying element it can be even more fun, although this last is certainly not a requirement. My wife loves this game too.

RATING: 4
This game has so many rules, chits, and text that it feels like I'm doing my taxes instead of playing a game. The theme (inter-dimensional beasts attack a sleepy college town filled with Anglo-Saxon characters based on the racially exclusionist works of a white supremacist) is weird. It's a fun game to irritate your friends by moving around the table trying to read everything. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An absolutely wonderful mix of random luck and strategy.  Games can play out so differently depending on draws, characters and the ancient one.  I love the cooperative nature and top notch theme.  Great art, great components.  Keep it to 4 players and it doesn't even have to take that long.

There was a time I would have rated Arkham Horror a 9 or 10. It was love at first sight for me, and I rushed out and bought my own copy after my first play. Since then, my opinion of Arkham Horror, and of co-op games in general, has taken a nose dive. 

I feel it's unfair to give AH a low rating just because I no longer enjoy co-op games, but at the same time, even for people who still enjoy co-op games, I think there are plenty of good reasons to prefer other co-op games over this one. Namely, this game is way too long, extremely fiddly, and the game gets to be really predictable and repetitive after a few plays. 

There's very little room for varying strategies. It's just a simple logistics problem. Who needs to be where, and do what, at what time, in order for us to get X number of gates closed/sealed before turn Y? Rinse and repeat. 

Initially, this logistics problem seems like a tough nut to crack, and the group struggles to get it done, but after a few plays, the decisions become fairly obvious, and the only differences between plays come from the dice rolls. At that point, it's just a very long story-telling game, telling nearly the same story every time.

After two plays and two victories, I'm nonplussed. Maybe it was that I was playing with two new-to-the-game groups, but it felt like work. A lot of choices, but the outcomes seemed mostly random. So much to track that the game just feels exhausting.

A light game which could be a little too easy for more serious gamers(we've been playing it right and still it's just too easy most of the time). The rules may seem a bit confusing at first but once you get it going smooth it's easy to remember. Beautiful art works in the component. A bit lacking in tension and horror feel though it is a horror themed board game mainly because it just feels too easy for me and my gaming group. Some people may like it because of it because some people may feel games should not strain you and should refresh you instead. 

Been told expansion would up the challenge a bit. Planning to get expansion soon. I hate having an easy game in my collection.

RATING: 9
A classic. Not the most elegant design in the sense that it's super easy to forget or miss something on pretty every turn of the game. But since it's a co-op game, it's always possible to go back and fix things. Vanilla is great on its own, although the many expansions for it do add some variety and longevity to the game. I also own Eldritch Horror and, for me at least, it has NOT replaced Arkham. They're similar but there's still a unique charm to good ol' Arkham Horror.

RATING: 10
It's been a long and eventful 9 years since I bought this game, but it has been with me every step of the way.

It's been played with old friends that have long since parted company, it's been played on holidays away from home and has constantly been a talking point and reason to get together and have a good time. It's had times of little play but still keeps in the minds of me and my friends as we recount desperate battles won and lost against the Mythos over the years.

I expect it will receive many more plays to come (testament to AH's design and production quality) and to me at least it is one of the main reasons I still game today! It has made me a fan of all things Lovecraftian and I'm proud of it.

No other board game has effected me so profoundly.

Recently I've become conflicted with which is better- Arkham or Eldritch Horror? At first I thought Eldritch but as I play it more I find its just not as deep, satisfying or interesting as Arkham. It also has less control and effective decision making then Arkham, and that's saying something!

Biggest wins to date: 28 victory points against Hastur and against Ithequa in 4 player games!

A guide to playing a GOOD game of Arkham Horror (take it from me, I know what I'm talking about):

1/ Only play when there's 3-5 players.
Two players is not enough, and if more then 4 ALL players must be AH veterans. Otherwise AP and downtime will spiral out of control.

2/ NO non-gamers. Who is this idiot drinking, giggling, sending text messages and then looking stupefied when their turn comes around? I don't care if it's your girlfriend! Get them out of the gaming room! Arkham  requires concentration and people all interested in playing. Let these onto the table and you might as well be playing Monopoly.

3/ Don't start a game after 9pm unless you are all Arkham veterans. Arkham requires concentration and energy- nobody wants to still be playing at 2am in the morning because everyone's exhausted and slowed down their game.

4/ Check peoples moods. Arkham requires will power and positivity- don't play if someone has had a bad day. It may only make things worse. If people are looking like the Mythos is taking its toll stop for a break. Get a drink, go to the loo, have a cig, chill for 5-10 minutes and regroup!

5/ Have the two most experienced players handling all the book keeping, adding tokens, dealing cards, etc. to keep the game flowing quickly.

These steps alone will improve play- if you have only played Arkham once and hated it, chances are one of the above conditions was not checked.

Daunting.  This purchase was made primarily for solo play, but I need to make the commitment to learn it (and to that end, it's been an epic fail to-date).  I'm fairly comfortable that I'll be taking a real swing at this game as the weather turns sour here as Summer winds down.  I've read through the manual a few times and while there are a lot of bits, the overall complexity doesn't seem as horrific as the game theme.

2/3/2016
3 1/2 years later and have yet to play.  However, after experience with games reflecting far greater complexity such as Mage Knight, the game no longer seems too big or complex.  However, is it worth it for me to pull out and play?  Still up for trade, but I could decide to pull it out and 
Play it at some point.

11/8/2016
OK... Now have played this plus expansions solo several times.  Very fun game and definitely a keeper.  Generally best for me during the winter when the Minnesota weather turns sour.  So, just about Arkham season again!

4/13/2017
I used to be on the side of playing "Epic Arkham" with everything mixed in, but in my recent plays have come to appreciate the niceties of limiting the expansions with each play.  This presented a whole new set of storage requirements which I have now completed with the help of foam core, hobby lobby and the broken a token.  I really do enjoy this game solo.

8/15/2017
Summer's here.  Gloomhaven has been sitting on my solo gaming space for 3 months with no plays yet since it is "outside" season here in Minnesota.  By the time the weather turns, I'll probably have to scratch my Arkham itch before working through Gloomhaven.  Still one of my enjoyable games to play (and even think about playing).

RATING: 6.5
UPDATE:  Moved it up a bit after a very good 6-player experience.  I still think this design is based less on decision making than die rolling, but with the right group it can be quite fun.

I think this game would shine in certain situations, but in general all the constant rolling gets in the way of the mood.  And that's if you know what you're doing during the game, and don't need to check this card against that token with the other rule.  How can you get immersed into Lovecraft's world if you are constantly being jerked out of it to roll?  Roll for Sanity check, roll for being Cursed, roll to go to the bathroom.  That's  like the stage manager of a show coming onstage every five minutes to make sure the show is going well.  Get out of the way and let us enjoy it, please, for the love of...well, you know.

The production values are nothing short of amazing, but in typical FFG fashion, it seems as if the designers spent time finding new ways to include more bits.  Oh, for Martin Wallace to bring just a bit of his legendary elegance here!  Or even Knizia...he's right there after all!  

That all said, I would definitely play this again now that I know the rules.  Maybe in my next play I won't feel the machinery moving quite so much.

A tough learning curve in the sense that so much of the game is spent in the rulebook. There is something about the flow of the turns and phases that just fails to be intuitive for me. Should I persevere?...

edit - I persevered! and upped it's score to an eight. A fantastic adventure/exploration game.

2nd edit - more play and more expansions... This game is huge. I can't think of a bigger adventure/exploration game in this style. Fantastic stuff and I'm upping it to a rare 9.

The very first of my board games. Great game at first, the theme contributing big time, but as time goes by, the gaming becomes mechanical and most of the locations go unregarded while players robotically and rigidly pursue their common goal.

As of this writing I only have one play under my belt and boy, all I can say is that I am underwhelmed by this game. This is so much rampant luck going on I might as well play a roll and move game. Also I didn't see any challenge; never at any point during our play did I feel as though we were going to lose. In fact at the end we just flipped over cards quickly to see if we could seal the last gate just to wrap it up. Now, this was with 7 players. Maybe if we played with the recomended 3 or 4 player I might have another opinion, but for now there are way too many other games I would rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have to be honest. I got into this game solely because it is a Lovecraftian horror and I had been playing the Call of Cthulhu RPG for a few years.  I wanted to recapture some of the cooperative gameplay and randomness without having our 8-person gaming group all present.  As we get a little older, we got busier as well.

This game is a great with 3-4 players but it gets to be a little long with more than 5 people.  You can even play solo!

You will lose some of the impromptu storytelling from the RPG because the boardgame will lay it out for you, but overall gameplay is a lot quicker.

This fun, polished game that does not disappoint!

RATING: 8.5
Rating based on first 2-player game with Dunwich expansion. This is great if you like games that crossover between RPGs and boardgames. Lots of chrome and dripping with theme and beautiful artwork. I wouldn't play with the Dunwich expansion again unless there were 3-4 players. The 2-player version of the DH expansions seems to require more time spent on administration and less on players having any effect on the game environment to be worth the 3 hours play time. AH is definitely not for Eurosnoots, but those who are prepared to enjoy a pseudo-role playing experience should have a lot of fun. Looking forward to playing it again with more players, preferably 3-4. I think 5 or more players might have too much downtime. 
Updated to an 8.5 This game is fun if all the players are prepared to treat it as pseudo-roleplaying experience. Bringing alcohol to a gaming session will help (but keep it away from the board!). This game is NOT a mathematical puzzle to be solved, but an interactive story.
Updated to a 9. I think AH is really good to have in the game library for 3-5 players, to be played every 4-6 weeks as an excellent change in pace and tone from eurogames. It won't appeal to hardcore eurogamers, and players prone to analysis paralysis would detract from its pace and levity.

A great game which would appeal to RPG'ers. The increasing desperation of the players as the evil ones gradually get a greater hold on the community brings the theming to life (or death!!).

I took my former rating of 6 up to a 7, just because it keeps hitting the table. Replay isn't too bad, each game tends to spin off in a wildly different direction. All the card action makes for a lot of random elements, but in a way much of the fun is in adapting to the situation as it changes.

Edit- Up from 7 to 8. Still a favorite, and the expansions add a crapload of good times. Having introduced a lot of new people to this game, only a very few didn't find it interesting, and I think they were determined not to enjoy it regardless. "Cooperative" and "Cthulhu" are four letter words to some gamers, apparently.

Months later... still going up in rating as everyone always wants to play it, this time from 8 to 9. It's gone from being a decent game with nice components and theme to being "the" game we play with 5-8 people. Only two of us are interested in Lovecraft, CoC or the mythos. What this game offers is a new experience every time, lots of laughs, and tons of player interaction. We play with a few house rules to spice it up: the GOO and investigators are drawn at random, gates are played face down until entry, and someone else always reads your encounter card text, always stopping at the IF statement... you can't know the consequences of your decision before making it.

It's here that I have to stop and ponder the fact that I just rated Arkham Horror a 9. It isn't elegant, competitive or eurosnooty. It's grade A Ameritrash, and it's one of my favorites. I'm coming out of the closet.

It's worth mentioning that the few people who weren't interested in playing are now doing so regularly and loving it.

The main drawback of this game is the end battle. It's basically a dice-fest royale, and can seem anticlimactic. I would like to see an expansion that had some kind of end fight variants.

You know a game is good when you lose 7 out of 10 times and still consider it one of your favorites. We always come back for more. It takes a whole night, but I do enjoy the cooperative gameplay. And I am a fan of the Lovecraft mythos, so this is right up my alley.

Seemed decent enough, although Eldritch Horror decimated this for me & does everything better. Waaaay too long. Like Eldritch, it requires good company, people who are willing to submerge into the world of Lovecraft, even try to roleplay a little. This will soften the fact that in the end the game is about drawing cards and throwing dice.

great game for cooperative play; rules and pieces a little overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it; I don't think it's all that "fiddly" - the only thing fiddly to me is having to shuffle the small location decks over and over (why not have charts? I guess they're out of fashion)

This is the type of game that I usually like. First of all I  am a big fan of Cthulhu Mythos etc. I've been playing Call of Cthulhu for more than 10 years now. So the theme is the main attraction for this game for me. So far I wasn't disappointed by the game. I like the cooperative style that it requires. My only complaint is that the game is too easy (and we play with all the expansions). Fight the unspeakable forces of evil should be harder than that :)

If you enjoy the Cthulhu Mythos then this game will be even better for you. Sort of a stand in to RPG's, you get some of the mystery of Cthulhu without really getting into the RP side.

The game is great because it is a co-op game and can be played with one person. The rules are a little heavy and unless you play frequently (which I don't) they can really bog down the beginning of a game. The bad side of the game is that it takes up a lot of room, especially if you add the expansions, and takes a while to play. Most of the people I normally play with don't have the patience for the long time this game takes and you can be put out of commmission for a while during the game which can cause even more waiting.

Arkham Horror is a good game, but I usually don't have the time.  It's a really odd thing...I sit down to play Arkham and enjoy it for the first hour or so.  By the end of the game, I'm ready to be done with it.  Shortly after it finishes, I kinda want to play it again.

Even if it's a game that takes hours to setup and play, it's the most played of my collection still. So many adventures were lived in Arkham and so many stories were shaped there. More than a game, a storytelling tool that lets you live for a night the true atmosphere of the Lovecraftian mythos.

There isn't a better game in terms of the experience, the fun, and the atmosphere. This is a special game for me also, as it's the one I credit for getting me into the hobby, and I have yet to play something better than it. Being that I have a background in video games, Arkham Horror showed me what board games are capable of. Yes, it's fiddly. Yes, it takes awhile to set up. But when a game offers such an immersive and engaging RPG-like experience, I think those are easy facets to become accustomed to.

UPDATE: Age is finally creeping up on this one. Plus the fact that so many other spin-offs exist means that this one doesn't stand out from the crowd as much anymore. As long as the app exists, Mansions of Madness is my go-to Lovecraftian game. If, for some reason, they stopped supporting that, I'd come back to AH, as it does Lovecraftian adventure the best otherwise, by far.

Much like its brother "Fury of Dracula," it is a game which takes some patience to fully comprehend.  Once understood, however, this game is quite exciting, with multiple outcomes each and every time you play due to multiple playable characters, tons of monsters, and a mass of ancient ones who can change the course of the game by their mere presence near the board!  A must buy for any strategy lover looking to bridge horror with thought and bring their friends along for the adventure!!

A másik nagy fájdalmam. Nincs meg a szükséges társaságom hozzá. Persze az első 3 játékban én is sokat hibáztam, sok volt a holtidő, míg a szabályokat keresgéltük, vontatott is volt, de én látom benne a nagy kedvencet csak még sokat kell vele játszani, hogy meg is ismerjük azt. Hősiesen várakozik a polcon, hogy kibontakozhasson végre.

Sajnos továbbra se lett hozzá társaságom. Egy játékot még kisajtoltam belőle, de a többségnék most se jött be a nehéz játékmenet. 5-6 pártatlan meg nincs kedvük rövid időn belül belerakni, hogy utána felpörögjön a dolog. Kicsit fájó szívvel, de eladtam. Ennek ellenére remélem lesz még lehetőségem játszani vele.

I was a big Call of Cthulhu guy back in the 80's. I've heard that this game is long and can be tedious, but as soon as I found out that you can play it solo, I just had to have it. Just bought it. Now I have to read the 25 pages of rules...

I like AH a lot.  Downsides are longish play time and setup (gotta dig out all those cards and fiddle with tokens...), and not a lot of strategic decisions.  Sure, you have to make decisions, and there is strategy, but I think you're largely at the mercy of fate.  This ties into the thematic elements, which is what makes the game work.  I don't like the reverse momentum of the base rules- the game slows down at the end, instead of building up tension and speed.  But the Stormknight variant and a couple of house rules do a good job of patching that.  Once the momentum is fixed, there is storytelling goodness.  It's a good social game.  I feel like a couple of locations are broken in the base game (train station, Silver Twilight Lodge Inner Sanctum) in that I try to never go there due to unfavorable encounters.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The epitome of ameritrash. Too much setup time, too long, too many chits, too many rules, too many randomisers, too many exceptions, too many symbols, too much stuff everywhere. Wiser men than me once said: "If Arkham Horror was a competitive game, it would be considered unplayable." and "In Arkham, all the different Great Old Ones do is changing the rules we keep forgetting."

Even if you don't acknowledge that the real horror is the gameplay, on the story side location cards (telling random stuff your character does neither under your consent nor under madness) disconnect you from both the overall plot and your sense of incarnation. Also I'd really like to know how taking down an awakened Cthulhu with a church-blessed (!) shotgun doesn't obliterate any Mythos-related suspension of disbelief.

This is a very thematic game with lots of flavor and atmosphere, which is also one of its weaknesses since it's not for everyone or for every occasion. It does have a very Lovecraftian feel though, so on that alone I would have to give it some points. But the real issue with Arkham Horror is that it is so long and complicated that it's not easy to pick up. So, while it's very thematic, much more so than say Elder Sign with which it shares many commonalities, it's just not a game that I would every play very much.

RATING: 4
I really like cooperative games, so this was a must have for me.  You have lots of options as to what to do which makes re-playability a little higher than other cooperative games like Shadows over Camelot or Lord of the Rings.  However, there is huge setup and teardown time associated with this game and it can be very slow to play.  I am unlikely to ever play this other than with one other person, playing two characters each.

I spent a long time waiting for this little blasphemous beastie, and I'm glad I did. Tickles the hard-core Lovecraft nerves that never seem to get scabbed over. It's no Eurogame, that's for sure. Highly random, wildly stacked against the players, and sometimes frustrating, it's a perfect simulation of what life might be like when finally the stars are right. Lovecraft would approve, if he hadn't detested games. That's the way the Star-Spawn swim, I guess. I loved it, and so did the two buddies I played it with (neither of which is a Lovecraft fan). Ia!

Best co-op game I've ever played, retains a lot of the flavor of HPL stories. All games are tense, with the investigators running to close the gates before the Great Old One awakes.

I own the following expansions: Dunwitch Horror, Curse of the Dark Pharaoh and The King in Yellow.

Excellent. Now I'm sure about it. Every time you open a FantasyFlightGames box, and see a lot of bits, cards and so... and finally you discover an encyclopedia instead of a rulebook, YOU SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID. FantasyFlightGames are easier to play than they seem.

Arkham Horror is a great game. Full of tension, VERY hard to defeat and in the end, even if you fail your task to stop the ancient one, it's one of the most satisfying games I've ever played.  If you have played Call of Cthulhu, the atmosphere is just like that (this game is for Call of Cthulhu, what Runebound is for Dungeons and Dragons... but multiplied by 10!!!).

My first session was Two Players. Took about 3 and a half hours and we didn't notice the clock ticking. This game just drags you into it just like Cthulhu would drag you to his mouth with one of his tentacles!

I still need to play it with more than 4 players to have another view of the game, but with 2 players this game is a blast!

2007-03-15: Another AH session. This time we were three players. Nah! It's nearly impossible to beat that game. our Ancient One was played by..... CTHULHU himself! We just died surrounded by a painful agony, corpses all over Arkham... and some Zombies chewing our brains. This game is really a blast. No game I have played before brings that frustration feeling so painfully than this one. I'm really impressed. It's just like playing Call of Cthulhu RPG.

2007-03-18: At last... an Ancient One was defeated. Yog-Sothoth fought hard to get our of his slumber, made our live almost impossible, but in the end, the gates were closed just in time. I think we were pretty lucky in this game, starting for the fact that we drew two elder signs from the Unique item deck. Will this game become a 10 for me? I don't know... but every time I play it, my game experience just gets better and better.

2007-03-21: Addiction. There's no other way for me to name how I feel about this game. The 4 playing hours are no issue for me. Today, we faced Ithaqua. Again, we were overrun by a swarm of monsters crawling down the streets of Arkham. This was a 5 player session. I really think 5 is too much for this game to be played with. Now, downtime starts to delay players, even if everyone has played the game before. I need to give this game a try with 4 players to see what happens. This game is awesome... probably, going right to a 10 rating for me.

2007-03-24. Shub-Niggurath killed us all. This time IT woke up right under our feet. We managed to hurt IT badly, but it was not enough.

2007-03-30: Azathoth is so dumb, slow and even if he is allmighty, we managed to stop him. Six Elder Signs sealed ITS way down to Arkham. 

2007-04-27: Nyarlathotep is not as deadly as his masks. He woke up from his slumber and fought against some sort of magician and a nun... to find his death against the angry nun.

2007-06-30: 5 player game against Hastur. He was defeated on the very last minute! Pretty hard to manage the extra Clue Token cost to seal gates.

Excellent thematic game. Incredible aspects include an equally pleasant game for one player up to eight, and the ability to produce new situations after a whole year of heavy play. Also, it is easy to introduce new players, even with the heavier than average rulebook.

RATING: 5
From a game design standpoint: singularly awful. 

Tedious bookkeeping to track the number of monsters that easily blend into the busy artwork, so that you can...what? Determine when shops close? Who cares? Yet if you remove that element, you can oftentimes break the game because so much should ride on the players eliminating the monsters. This is especially true with certain Great Old Ones that rely on the fear track. 

The narrative is force-fed to the players, who apparently cannot be trusted to determine for themselves what is occurring on the board. Instead, we need to be handed expository event cards that present a shallow causal relationship ("You go into a house and hear a low wind. Lose 2 Sanity.") which is divorced from the events on the board and are neither determined by player decision nor decided by them. Since nearly everything in the game is decided by dice or card, there is almost no meaningful player decision. 

Worse, players may (and usually will) find that their character is not very adept at handling what the game is throwing at them, and in groups of 4, usually at least 1 of them is left to meander around the board doing next to nothing. 

This game slows to a crawl when you are doing well; close the gates and fewer things happen. It is most interesting when you are doing poorly. 

In terms of theme: awful. Lovecraft's monsters were the culmination and evidence of an awful truth. Arkham Horror's monsters are fodder. This is especially evident when you play only to defeat the Elder Gods in combat.

Oh boy, what a great game this is!! I absolutely love it... The year is 1926. An ancient evil force is trying to get hold of Arkham, a fictional town in Massachussetts, opening dimensional gates and sending his monster servants through the streets. The feeling you get by playing this one is more than just a unique one. There are so many options, so many decisions have to be made and there is an abundance of thematic flavor that it really feels like you are one of the main characters in a (Lovecraft) book. I guess this must be one of the best titles I ever played. One of the longest ones too, so if you don't like games which can last longer than 2 hours, Arkham is definitely no place for you.

I guess this is an epitome of "Ameritrash." My first adventure game. Not terribly impressed, in no hurry to play again. Complicated but not deep, a lack of long term strategic thought.

RATING: 6
I admit that the thematic feel of this game is off the charts.  It is also a great co-op game for you and your friends to try and beat collectively.  The quality is typical FFG and is excellent.  However, I feel that the rules are way too difficult to give the players much of a chance at winning.  Events are just too frequent and punishing to players if they make the slightest mistake.  One random card can ruin a couple of hours worth of strategy the team has put together trying to give themselves a chance to win.  I think house rules are in order for this one to make it a little more enjoyable.  As it is now, my playgroup looks at it on the shelf and skips it because of that dreaded feeling of "why play when you don't have much of a chance of winning?"

RATING: 10
I love playing this game. I don't think I have ever had a bad time playing it, even when we've lost. Even when we've lost horribly! Even the times when I was frustrated because I couldn't use my character's abilities to their best advantage, I've had a good time playing. I like the theme, and I like that it's cooperative, and I like that it is so hard that you go into it with a devil-may-care doomed feeling...the euphoria that accompanies a win is glorious. Anytime Arkham Horror is suggested and we have enough time to play, I will say yes to this game. Anytime that I think we DON'T have enough time to play, I will groan like my heart is being ripped in half.

After we got comfortable with the base game, we worked into a habit of playing this with one big box expansion and one little box expansion (or two or three little boxes if we really wanted to depress, er, I mean, challenge ourselves).

RATING: 7
I've only played this game at Gencons, and although I enjoyed each experience (4 so far) the game just didn't engage me.  V. high production values, but fiddly, ie., lots of bits.  Just seems like another go around and collect stuff and then kill something game.

Update: O.k., I've been to a couple more Gencons, and that means I've played AH a couple more times.  Seems to play much, much better without players who've memorized some sort of mechanical strategy.  Played for atmosphere it can produce a tense, down to the wire game.  The expansions seem to crank up both the challenge and the atmosphere.  So, I've bumped my rating up by 1.

Update 2: After the annual Gencon plays (with someone else teaching the rules), I got this as a solo game.  IF you already know the rules it makes for a good solo experience.  Bumped up the rating another point.

Playing Eldritch Horror revitalized my interest in this game.  I bought myself the base and all of the expansion as a Christmas present and never looked back.  I love this game.  Has a much different feel than Eldritch Horror and honestly, is really best played solo or with people that can leave it at the table.  I wouldn't want to play this in one sitting.  It's a great game to play over vacations and decent periods of downtime over the holidays.  Set it up, play a few turns, go do something else for the rest of the day, come back to it and enjoy.

RATING: 1
Takes like forever and is quite boring. I analyzed all cards and the danger of the cards and zones and the game is totally imbalanced. If you stand on the right place you nearly can not loose (nearly always quite mighty cards or at least good ones). Won't play it again.
Edit. Won't play it again EVER.

Preliminary rating based on only one play with 5 players.  This game's not bad; it suffers from too much downtime between turns, and at least in the scenario we played, the endgame against the G.O.O. wasn't very dramatic or interesting (just a lot of tedious dice rolling).  Lots of cool bits though, and an interesting system for managing player stats.  Probably a better game with 4 or fewer players.

RATING: 5
I like this game yet I never feel like I'm actually in control of anything when I play. I think my favorite part is the flavor text on the cards.

Update: My rating of this game has taken a dive recently. I do not find the game very compelling at all and the gameplay shockingly a bit bland! Losing turns left and right, random devourings, same old combat over and over again.

Lovecraftian mythos in a game that just oozes theme. Great co-op play and for the most part avoids the "busdriver effect" (where one person more or less directs everyone's moves); there's rarely an obviously best option on a given turn, but rather two or three choices that all tend to equally push towards the goal.

An intriguingly designed co-op/solitaire game which oozes atmosphere, tension and humour. Excellent production values and easily worth both the money and the effort of lugging it around! 

It only loses the last point because, if both the players and the 'game' have simultaneous runs of bad luck near the end, it can end up frustratingly drawn out. However, that is rare in my experience, and this is a firm and justified favorite.

Lots of "stuff" -- events, items, rules -- but I have to be in the right mood for it, due to the randomness and cooperative aspects. Then again, I also find it fun for the occasional solo play.

Great immersion in the theme, nice adventure with a lot of encounters. Rules at the beginning are not fluent. It's necessary to have print some aids. The challenge is difficult. The only thing that we don't play it a lot is the time of play. We must have an afternoon to play it.

Yes, this game is primarily luck driven. Yes, this game can be very very boring if played with the wrong people. Yes, this game takes forever and frequently ends up being either too easy or too hard.

This game has excellent theme.  Truly bar none in that department.  However, the game seems to be a bit of the same thing everytime.  The big guy always comes out and you get killed.  Seems to be a problem with the amount of time the game takes for the fun-factor that you get out of it.  Would I play it again?  Yes, it's just that I probably wouldn't be the one to bring it up.  Some game mechanic problems as well.

The more I play this game, the more that it's rating suffers for me.  Just too long for a semi broken game.

As a fan of Runebound and adventure games this one has to be the best! This game has a lot of depth and doesn't need expansions to have such great replayability. There is so much tension, so much stress, that when the game ends (losing it) we feel the relief of ending the session!

The game itself takes 3+ hours to play (3 hours is a "quick" game for AH). The clean-up doesn't take as long (thank goodness).

Wonderful co-op with a Lovecraftian theme! Surprisingly often, the cards manages to tell a story that you are glad to be a part of. Oh yeah, the game hates you :P
Lots of characters, equipment, spells, and... lots of everything really. High replay value even without expansions.
Extremly random. Sometimes you lose within 30 minutes, sometimes it's a 5 hour affair, but you always come back for more! (It's usualy closer to 5 hours though...)
Horrible rule book, even for FFG standards. Expect 5-10 games to get things right. I know of people who own the game, but haven't played it, because they can't understand the rules...
Hits the table rather often, but would have been more often if it didn't take 30 minutes to set up and then another 30 minutes to clear away...

I guess I'm going to have to buy Dark Pharaohs and then Dunwich Horror. I am some kind of a sucker...damnn

e:2013 - Dropped to a 3. I can't stand this game. It's just dull as dishwater. 

Has gone down from a solid 9 to a 5 over the last 7 years. I honestly can't be arsed to play this more than once a year now. It's just. too. fucking. long. 

Compounding this problem is the fact that the only time anyone asks to play it is when there are 5 people who have never played it before sitting down to play. This adds about 30 minutes for a rules reading. 

Setup is long, play is long, cleanup is long. I'd just rather play just about  anything else.

Early play experiences include a single solitaire play and a play with six.   Six inexperienced players was a mess of an experience.  Crazy downtime, tokens everywhere, and a general discontent resulting from not understanding the goals completely.  I can write it off from throwing six players into the game with no real understanding of the rules, it's a player fault (namely mine), but it is a testament to the game that some narrative managed to sneak through and at least half the people would play it again.  There is a lot of potential resting in the corners and there were enough exciting moments to encourage further plays.

I've only begun to play this one so I haven't formed strong opinions yet, but my first impression is positive.The strong theme makes the game easy to immerse one's self in. Although there are tons of bits and circumstances to deal with, gameplay is surprisingly smooth. The long set-up time and play time will prevent this from hitting the table too often, but the cooperative nature of the game makes it so that solo play isn't all that much different than multi-player, so it won't be as limited as it otherwise might be. By the end of my first games the repetetive nature of the game was getting to me a little bit. I was becoming impatient with the same-old-routine. We'll see if this trend continues.
***
Updated 01-20-09: I had given up on this one after my son (with whom I mainly play it) lost interest due to the tediously repetetive nature of the game, but I played it again yesterday with an adult gaming buddy and I had a good time. Now I have renewed hope.

Very enjoyable. I rate an 8 becuase it does get a little repetitive and trying to defeat the end "boss" is a little frustrating.

A group of us finally got together and played a game of Arkham Horror and we had fun working together to keep the Ancient One from awakening by shutting down the portals that show up all throughout Arkham City.  While playing, it is very easy for players to immerse themselves in the theme of this game by reading all the text on the cards, the backgrounds to the characters, and the general story told by the game.

Because of the overly complicated rules we missed one or two monster surges and we felt like the anxiety was getting ramped up at the end, to just see us win quite easily.  Kind of a let-down for all the investment we had already put in.

This game oozes theme.  I would love to play again with a willing group, candles, scary music, and lots of spare time, although the time investment and the overly complicated rules makes this a game that might not be in my collection forever.

Great game. We think Eldritch Horror will make it to the table way more. All the maps in the base box, all the rest in a giant Husky toolbox with tons of extra dice.

RATING: 5
Only played once, but I can say safely that no matter how much I enjoyed the theme of the game, I don't have the time. When my friends and I play boardgames it's usually on a constrained schedule because we all have different schedules. This game takes a long time to set up and a very very long time to play. Lots of dice and misery, which was fun when I played but I can't get behind it for 3 hours very often. I respect it for what it is, but for now, it just isn't for me. Great artwork and theme. Too many chits. Too long. Rule book is fairly long and a little dense.

Edit: I recently expressed interest in selling it. My friends who played were more upset than I could have imagined. It must have left an impact on them! I may break this out for old time's sake before I send it off to the pasture.

this is an amazing cooperative game; great theme, with lots to do. plays a bit long, and takes up A LOT of room, otherwise I'd play more often.

RATING: 6.5
A very fun game that would rank much higher if the endgame was any good.  By the time it appears, you're pretty much aware if you're going to win or lose -- but it takes an hour-plus to get there, and one bad roll could reset that clock.

Before the 3rd Act, it's an 8.5.

Like many games from Fantasy Flight, I wonder if this would make a better XBLA game.  So much of the busywork of this game could be automated, and gametime would be down to an hour.  Six years later, in the thick of the game-app partnership, I'm amazed they haven't done something.  Get on that, ANA.

Fun with the right group, but it is very time consuming and almost requires someone to assume a DM-like role to keep the game moving along.  It doesn't get to the table all that often.

There is a lot to set up, but it is worth it. This game comes the closest to capturing the Lovecraft sense of dread and hopelessness that pervades his books. I really like this game and am in the process of getting all the expansions.

RATING: 8
My favorite cooperative game (besides old AD&D 1st-3rd editions). Every game of it I've played was a great social and gaming event, and I never felt like just handing my stuff to someone else and telling them to just "play it for me" (Like so many coop games I've played.) Personally, I don't like many cooperative games, but this one shines.

RATING: 5
Too long, too hard, too random. You can get screwed from the start with a bad rumor. By the end, you don't even care if you win or lose, you just want the game to be over. If you're fast and you don't really read the cards you can get the game length to around 5 hours. Just play pandemic. Or Elder Sign if you like the theme. It's way too easy to have one investigator just end up useless with each turn you just gain 1 stamina or 1 sanity. Also, the rules are a complete mess. There are so many exceptions and contradictions. For example, what happens when you die but are already lost in time and space? Who knows? Who cares? Played the game maybe a dozen times, and I spent just as much time online reading rules on the twelfth time as I did the first time (Although, the first six games I played so incorrectly that it didn't count).

Bumping from a 4 to a 5 cause I'm a sucker for these sorts of games, and I'm itching to try it again. I hate it, but I can't help myself.

RATING: 6
This game feels a bit long for what it is. The large amount of random stuff happening (items, gates, monsters, events, fighting) kind of overshadows the few choices you make in the game (where ot move/attack). Besides, your movement is fairly scripted since there will likely be an obvious strategy to follow. The theme is cool, but at 4 hours, this game is too much.

New thoughts. This game is mostly about getting into the theme. Since what you have to do is mostly scripted, it's mainly about just enjoying the game and getting into the mood of it. With the right people it's a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The theme impregnates all the game. The characters really feel different, and the action mirrors the Lovecraft stories and the RPG games. The Ancient Ones are quite generic though, and they doesn't have that ambientation richness to them.

The most interesting feature of the game is the possibility of changing the skill levels, increasing ones at the cost of others.

Even if it features the "leader" issue that plagues most cooperative games, the joint planification and and coordination is paramount in order to obtain success. Even if it is ultimately possible, it is difficult for one player to think and manage every aspect of the game, there's always room for individual contributions, especially bewteen players with similar levels of experience.

Now, the issues:
-> Winning strategy: 
[o][SPOILER ALERT]
The game is quite easy as long as you focus your resources (especially the clues) in achieving the final objective, closing the portals. But the game becomes a walk in the park when you follow some easy tips: keep searching for unique items until you can buy 2-3 Elder Signs (or King in Yellow tomes), never close portals without sealing them, etc.
[/SPOILER ALERT][/o]
-> Very poor scaling (in fact, scaling is almost non-existant); the more players are, the easier the game is.
-> It's a bit long.

Even with these issues, and even knowing that Eldritch Horror provides a similar experience and adresses sucessfully all these issues, a game of Arkham Horror is still a good experience.

I have no idea how much the many expansions can solve this. I don't know if I will sell my base game and focus on Eldritch Horror or I will try my chances with some expansion.

RATING: 8
An cooperation game with a Cthulhu-theme. Game is probably the best cooperation game I have played. Theme is a great for an cooperation game. There are quite a bit of rules but it is enough that one player knows all the details, others don't need to know all of them. Game thematic and fun to play. There is a bit of downtime with 5 players but it isn't too bad. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I realy, realy love the theme but I have to admit that the game is too random and to loose for me. Its perfect for Lovecraft fans but can be a bit disapionting for non initiates.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
With a half-ton of pieces, several different scenarios (Old Ones), and a dozen different characters, you certainly get a lot for your money. The event cards (Mythos) insure that no two games are likely to be the same. There are lots of toys to find and bad guys to try and stop, only adding to the fun chaotic play.

NOTE: get one of the play summaries/help sheets above before playing the game; it will speed the play up tremendously, and not make 25-50% of session be spent on looking $h!t up.

Arkham plays out like an HPL story. The locations are abstracted, but the theme sucks you in. Lovecrafts 1920s come alive, as flapper heiresses and dashing archeologists fight it out with cultists and mostrous things that should not be. A nameless horror is awakening and only you can stop it before it slaughters everything. Are you up defeating the Old Ones, or will you wind up a gibbering lunatic wandering the streets as the giant foot of Evil stomps down upon the world.

Owned by a friend. Very fun adventure game based on Cthulu. I didn't like that the spells were not very good and that the game runs a little long for some people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I never thought I could play a four hour game without getting at least a little bored occasionally. This is frighteningly good entertainment, and there is very little downtime except on those rare occasions when fighting several monsters at the same time.

Definitely needs a tackle box to keep all those components organized.

There isn't much incentive to visit some of the locations. Hopefully the expansions will tackle this issue.

RATING: 3
This game has a thrilling theme and nice components, I give it that. The game system, however, does not excite. This is actually a real stinker. First of all this game is very repetive. Choices you make are either obvious or trivial. Most of the time there is not much you can do except throw dice and hope for the best. Arkham Horror takes much too long for its own good: it can take over five hours. Did I mention there is a lot of downtime in this game? Most of the time you are just waiting for your turn without much need to follow random encounters taking place on the board. When your turn comes you throw dice. If you are lucky nothing happens and then you wait some more. Arkham Horror, it seems to me, is a board game for people who enjoy role playing games. I am not one of them.

6 -> 7.5 -> 7 -> 6.5

This game is ONLY for Lovecraft's fans. 
Good that I'm one of them :)
(Rating should be 2.5 or 3 for "normal" players)

Edit: (comment only for a base game)

- Fiddly
- Long (ca. 150-210 min. for two players; ca. 180-270 for three)
- It's very easy to kill Ancient One (even for two players)
- E-X-T-R-E-M-A-L-L-Y random

+ Beautiful components
+ Full of theme (...but I have to warn you: you can easily kill Ancient One with your Tommy Gun)

I don't know why but I like this game :)

Edit2: Quite repetive after some plays. This game really needs expansions to be more fun. Rating down to 6.

RATING: 5
Complex adventure/cooperative game. Great theme, but I've found the game lacks tension and the need to cooperate and sacrifice your turn for the greater good means that enjoyment for some players can be greatly reduced. Might be more enjoyable with a smaller group (I've only played with six). I think I might like more it if it was shorter and more desperate. Personally I'd rather play the Call of Cthulhu RPG with a decent GM, as cooperative board games just don't do it for me.

Beautiful Game Board and Pieces, but work mechanics ever. Probably the worst board game I have ever played in my life. We thought we had missed something but no after 4 tries in 2 days we just sat there bemused. 

I wouldn’t even sell this on, as I could not have it on my conscious that I took money for something this bad. I would feel like a crook.

I love the theme and the story, both of which are done to near perfection in this game. I love the rpg elements. I like that each turn could spell your doom. Co-ops are also always a hit in my group. I don't like how long this game takes to set up, and I don't like the times where it drags on and on with nothing happening, good or bad. So, flawed but great.

Update 2/11/15
Meh. Got repetitive, and it's way too long.

Expansions:
Dunwich Horror

Verdict:

What I Like: The theme. I adore the Lovecraftian mythos. The teamwork can hum along nicely too sometimes. 

What I Don't Like: Endlessly fiddly gameplay. Random dice rolls and card draws determine everything. EVERYTHING. It's long (2-4 hrs unless death comes early), with not much variety to be had unless I drop money on another expansion. Sometimes you just die or go insane, which is thematic I guess, but frustrating.

RATING: 2
Weighty, but definitely bloated. If you look at it like an optimization puzzle it's terrible, but as a story generator it's unparalleled.

So I guess I'm not sold on this one yet. Yes, the story is nice, and yes, the theme is treated right. But why can't I just play Flash Point, or Forbidden Island for a similar emergent co-op game? I'm not seeing the payoff just yet, but I'll keep trying.

--

Well decided to trade this off. There is a lot to like, but come on. Complexity needs to have a payoff, and it simply does not in this game. It's a co-op Talisman that manages to be even longer with 100x the fiddliness.

I want to love this game but the rules are a bit fiddly and I'm currently having to do constant rule book checks.  Could be excellent once I've got to grips with it. The base game also seems a little unbalanced - once a number of gates have been opened, the game sort of grinds to a halt - it really needs the Dunwich Horror expansion to make it flow properly.

Hoping for some future plays, but at the moment, I'm struggling to get this 3-4hr game to the table.

Very good co-operative game. Once in a while it is nice with a game without backstabbing or the possibility to enrich yourself at the expense of the other players. We have won about 3 out of 4 games, which may be too high a success rate for some, but I find it ok. Being a Lovecraft fan is not at all necessary, but you'll find yourself recognizing the names of monsters and places in the game and will generally feel more comfortable in the environment.

Another great thing about the game is the fact that you can play it solo.

I play this with my best friend Alex and we each control 2 characters. Have attempted once to play it with our wives, they both hated it, and we ended up playing it 2x2 again, so now we just don't bother asking them. We like it. It is certainly a long and fiddly game, but I am a Lovecraft fan and I enjoy the story unfolding + we like the mechanics. A very satisfying experience and none of our games felt the same. Having said that, it takes time to set up + a lot of time to play + a lot of time to return it to the box, time that, most of the time, we lack.

Un juego interesante y divertido, su principal pega, es que con todas las expansiones se puede hacer muy lioso y dificil, ademas, la suerte en las cartas determina mucho si seras activo o un mero espectador mientras tus amigos se cubren de gloria...

The game is fun when you understand the rules. My group had been trying to fall in love with it by force for about 4 years with about 1-2 games per year, with little success. Seriously: One players has to know the rules by heart, or the game will fail.
- On the good side: It's a talkative thematic game with many elements I like, and it's long enough for a full evening of play.
- On the bad side: expectations are not fulfilled. You may think there is a kind of role playing element - nope. You think the game creates an eerie atmosphere - nope. The rule book is one of the worst I know with no index and a forrible structure.
- Tactics: Your character needs money. Other things are far less important
- Best with 4 or 5 players.

This is a long game and the rules can get very chaotic at times, especially the Mythos Cards, yikes, at the very least they could have been written in order.

Arkham is one of those games, that has a lot going on and is relentless on the players.

It is best to dedicate a Fri night or Sat afternoon/ eve to play this game.  Have snacks/ drinks on hand and hang on to the ride.

Would recommend to the 13+ crowd as attention span can wane if the game is going horribly.

I have a love/hate relationship with Arkham Horror. Love the theme, the constant sense of impending doom, the feel of actually playing through a Lovecraft story. Hate the enormous number of things you need to remember, the sheer size of the game, the difficulty (some folks seem to think this game is easy, but I either have terrible luck or make terrible choices because it hasn't been easy for us yet).

Fun, fun, fun, perfect game to play solo or with 2-3-4 other players, otherwise it might start to drag & play-time would increase beyond acceptable.

Arkham Horror is definitely a different monster than most games that I've played. It has a great theme and I love how every game seems to tell a story. But there are couple of aspects that annoy me. First, once certain gates get closed and sealed, I think the game can drag on a bit too long. Secondly, it doesn't scale well. I think 3 or 4 is the magic number for this one. I'd like to try it though with Dunwich one day. 

Update: Ok, this one has proved itself. It's turned into one of my favorites. 10

Played a solo game once to learn the rules. Dual investigator game. Considerably hard to enjoy the game while controlling 2 characters. Think this has to be played as a thematic game in order to enjoy the full experience. Hope to try it with more players soon.

This game is all about theme.  The fiddliness of it stands in the way, though.  Also rather longish for the payoff.  Score on this one may go up with repeated plays, as we were starting to grok the system better towards the end.

This is my wife's favorite game yet! The cooperative game play is incredible! No game is ever the same as any previous game! You must beat the game! She always requests to play it, but time is hardly ever permitting. She has now taken to playing it by herself. Yes, it is a long game, but who cares...it's a blast! What a game to thrust you into a world on the brink of evil devastation and you must prevent it from happening. Huge task to complete! 

Every time I think about AH I get excited. This game is more than a game it is an experience. Every game is unique and memorable! Your investigator is in for one heck of a night. The game unfolds like a surreal movie, the story is subtle and random...but yet...in every game...there are these moments of...Wow...that was meant to be! The events are always exciting and when this one comes off the shelf for play it stays on the table a week or more; it stays out for at least 5 or more plays before it is even considered to be put away again. My wife says it's pure perfection itself!

Once I got past the rules of this, it became fun.  I literally had to rewrite the rules to cover the "special cases."  I like that it can be a 1-player game.  I'm considering an expansion if I keep playing it 1P.

A good cooperative (sort of?) game. I really like the cthulian theme and the monsters. But the game lacks cooperation. And I don`t find too many people who dare to play it with me because it is quite fiddly and requires quite some time to learn.

Large, not as complex as it looks, can be fun.

Certainly its starting to fall into a familiar pattern of play in the last few games.

Nice to play - I'm happy to play on other people's versions of it though rather than buy my own copy.

Whenever I've played (I've played more than my logged plays) I always feel a sense  of impending doom.  I never think I'm going to win, when I do it feels like an accomplishment, and for that reason I don't understand why people want this to be harder.  I approach this game as an experience, like roleplaying or playing Tales of the Arabian Nights, and find it most enjoyable that way.

Bought used, and considering that this is in great condition and all the cards were sleeved, the price was great!

One of the favorites!

This might not have the most meaningful decisions to be made, but the theme and feeling in general are awesome.

I'd say it's not about the game itself, but the story and the feeling of rising of the ultimate evil that has to be stopped that makes this great.

Did not love this game. Never felt like any sort of "story" emerged, the setup time is unbelievable, lots of downtime and it only gets worse when you actually spool it out to the full table of 8. Initially I thought it was because we don't love co-op games, and that's true, but it really comes down to the co-op. We like Pandemic and Space Alert just fine, but any time a single strong player can "run" the game for everyone, it gets a lot less fun.

Only the theme forgives the convoluted chrome and is probably the only reason to play. But it certainly does the theme thing really well. The decisions you make are one-dimensional (which location to go and experience, and whether to spend clue tokens for re-rolls) and there's little strategic tension, but (again) the theme does forgive a lot and give some reason to play with friends who like the same thing. I really liked the description of "whack-a-mole on steroids". That sums it up.

Sooo many decks of cards in this game... close to 20 I think??  Some other things should have been cut before production (I'm looking at you Bank Loan).  On one hand you have an excess of cards and unnecessary features; but on the other hand, too much is over-simplified by coming down to a d6 roll.  Are you about to die after 3 hours of play?  Roll a d6 and hope you get higher than a 4.  The theme is cool but the game is too long when everything comes down to random cards and d6 rolls.  I think it would be a lot more enjoyable if it were 1-2 hours long instead of 3-4.

RATING: 8
Only played it a couple times. Fun, but I felt there were too many minor rules, especially regarding combat, where the game feels unwieldy and that I have to read the rule book after every other move to remember exactly what to do.  But that would probably change after multi plays that are more consistent.

RATING: 5
"An older pure co-op that is overly complex, and which overstays its welcome. It would be good at 60 minutes, but is a bit painful at 180+. Several rules are pointless and/or counter-intuitive. Requires houserules to play with just 2 investigators."

What I like:
- Flavor text, in fonts that are less illegible than Elder Sign
- Moving around the map is more fun than Elder Sign

What I don't like:
- Requires houserules with just 1 or 2 investigators (I don't like playing multiple pawns)
- It would be far better as a 90 minute game (not 180+)
- It can feel like a treadmill (for hours)
- It can feel very punishing, and the dice can be cruel
- It would be far better with about half the rules
- The board could be smaller and not lose anything

After a solo (1-investigator) loss, I gave it a tentative rating of 4. After a 2-player 2-investigator win (but with misplayed rules), I rate it a 6. After a 2-player, 2-investigator game that we quit after 3 hours, It's a 5. A 5-player game months later didn't change my mind. 

I agree with the BGG-voted weight of 3.5, due to complexity (I would give the depth a 2.2).

RATING: 6
Excellent game with good solitaire possibilities.  Very "expansion friendly" which makes me think this will ultimately lead to new content.

Lots of bits means that set up time can be substantial. Gameplay changes a bit as the number of players increases.

I wouldn't say this is aging well. Find myself wanting to play it less and less, and when I do, wanting to play a streamlined version without so many expansions.

RATING: 7
The only minus for me is that it can be a really long game. But on the other hand this game has so many possibilities and ability of replay. I recommend to read some H.P.Lovecraft stories first - it will make the game even better, cause you will know the backstory of every detail in the game. Great game, thumbs up. I like to play long games as much as short games, but only long games make me feel like I'm really in some fantasy world !

RATING: 4
This game was no good to me! This game just tried to dissimulate its essence: being a dice game! And for a dice game it is way too heavy!! And expencive! you just walk around collect cards that give you more dice then those you already got. As soon as you may roll as many as 12+ dice, that's when you think you're ready for the ultimate dice fest vs the ultimate demon! No strategy, too luck thriven, no planing really! When it comes to dice... I rahter play "To Court the King", "Alhambra the Dice Game" or "Knights". Well at least these ones assume what they are and try to be good at it.

RATING: 3
Looks amazing when you first open it and dig into the rules and bits, but the gameplay itself can't live up to the bits. Too much errata/rules to get sorted out. Wife getting impatient with the constant back and forth from playing to reading the rules/flow charts. She expected more tension in the game, considering it is a horror game, but I have to say 'Pandemic' offers far more tension. They use similar mechanisms such as 'doom/terror track' and 'outbreak track' to move the game along, but in AH, there is rarely a time when the game feels 'tense' or that we are running out of time. The terror track never moves, and even the AO track never gets very high. A 3,4 hour game without tension is not a good thing. In 'pandemic' the tension is palpable almost from the start. Full points to AH for theme, though. Hopefully, some variants will increase the tensions factor, otherwise, the wife will be hesitant to play this again. I think her response was, 'Okay, there's a monster. I fight it, I almost always win. I don't win, I just get knocked out. Big deal. Where's the horror?" I cannot understand the rabid fandom that this game attracts. I love horror, but the only horror here is the ridiculous play time, the luck, the boredom, the lack of tension, and the endless setup. 

Since my wife doesn't like it, and I'm not too enthusiastic myself to try to get it back on the table, it's going to be placed on the 'trading' gate to get sucked into another dimension.

A great cooperative game. And fantastic for introducing players to advanced adventure board gaming, and particularly for introducing players to Fantasy Flight games. I always play Arkham first with a new group, because much of what they learn is useful in almost any other adventure board game, and some is useful in any advanced board game.

Like evil beings out to destroy the world?  Like creepy towns?  Like a university where you'd prefer to be expelled than stick around?  Like going slowly insane as you learn about the horrible things that are out there?  Well, then this is the game for you.

A dark game where you're playing the investigators looking to keep one of the Ancient Ones from waking and doing something nasty to the world around you.  It's a cooperative game, so if you're looking for competition, go elsewhere.  Quite fun, but there's a fair amount of down time between players acting, particularly as the number of players grows.

A fun time that usually ends up telling a good story.

With 4 people. 4.5 hours!  Was maybe an hour away from winning (50-50%)

Definitely better with 4 than with 6. Now want to try with 3. 3 worked pretty well and lessened downtime was nice.

RATING: 7
I like the feel of this game, and of course I love the Cthulhu Mythos, so yes, I do actually like this. But there are a few problems. Firstly, there are too many fiddly rules that interrupt gameplay and stop you getting into a nice rhythm. Too many parts where you have to go back to the rulebook looking for an answer. And unless you are Blessed and have half a dozen clues, you might not even find the answer. Ultimately, this game suffers from something I've seen in a few FF Games -unnecessary exceptions to the rules that only serve to make things messy and give you a headache, rather than improving the experience. Also, the game is too long. After 3 hours I am ready to finish, but I still have about 8 rounds waiting for clues to show up... Elder Sign and Eldritch Horror are much better options.

This is a great game for fans of complicated, multi-faceted games with a horror/fantasy twist, and is a fun game for the geek in all of us. Expect a moderately long setup time, and with all of the randomness in the game you will sometimes have games end up very exciting, and other times have games end up kind of boring and uninteresting. I found that playing with a large number of players was not generally a good idea both because of the time it takes and because having too many players rendered the game a little too easy. Small numbers of player (3-4) worked best and ended up with the most exciting games in my experience.

RATING: 6.5
If you are into the books I guess it would have been more fun. But I found this just to be a lot of random stuff and a lot of dice rolling for checks. Depending on what you pick up, you do have to discuss who will do what such as fighting monsters and closing gates, but mainly everyone can do what they want and the co-op seems to be lacking, only at the end if you have to fight the demon do you play together, somewhat. The expansions also just all seem to add more of the same.
The game looks nice and the theme is great, but the gameplay is kind of dull and repetitive. Not really my style of game. Worth trying though and on a second play I found it more fun, but still repetitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I picked this up when I first got into boardgaming heavily and really enjoyed it for a while. Now that I've played a lot more games I'm not so enamoured. My main issue is the sheer length of the game, it would easily be a 9 if I could get a game completed in around 2 hours. Unfortunately most of my games run at least three, if not 4 hours long. I find that the mechanics just become a little repetitive after a while and you also tend to get the same encounters coming up as well (even with the Dunwich Horror Expansion). It also doesn't really capture Lovecraft's horror; it is much more akin to an action horror movie since you spend a lot of your time killing hordes of monsters with a plethora of weapons. I've found Martin Wallace's A Study in Emerald to capture the feeling of Lovecraft's creations, of course Arkham Horror and ASiE are totally different games but if you're looking for a better fit for the Mythos theme I would look to ASiE.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The idea of Arkham Horror is initially very appealing.  Running around the streets battling monsters and traveling to other dimensions sealing portals.  Plenty of different characters to choose from, tons of spells and items, skills to learns, frequent encounters, and a boss at the end to boot.  Sounds great, right?  If only it didn't take as long to set up as it does to play and relied on something other than rolling dice for the main mechanics.  Fun for a while, but it gets old quickly.

A pretty relentless co-op. While there are some strategy details, the overall goal and execution is the same. Close the gates, keep them closed.

Theme is very apparent; engaging gameplay not as much.

I see Arkham Horror as less of a board game, and more as an experience. My favorite experience with Arkham Horror was playing with Lovecraft fans for the first time in the middle of a powerful thunderstorm. The lights were flickering, the storm was approaching, and the Ancient One was stirring in his sleep. I've rated Arkham Horror a 6 because these experiences are few and far between - with the right group, I can see this game being incredibly enjoyable. It is less fun with unenthusiastic players or those who want to 'win' and turn to more experienced players for advice on every move. Having a number of plays under my belt and a very good win/loss ratio, I'm probably ready to tackle an expansion (which do appear to add a lot more of a challenge to the game). I'm just not sure when I'll get around to picking up an expansion for this heavily thematic game.

Tutti contro uno, il Gioco. Un'ambientazione emozionante che ti fa giocare in apnea. Un sacco di gadget da usare, attivare, combinare, scambiare. Nessuno rema contro: si discute e ci si scervella per cercare di vincere insieme. Le strategie di attesa sono fallimentari, per cui vanno pungolati i giocatori più "cauti" in una corsa contro il tempo per evitare il confronto col mostro finale. Se si vuol vincere, oltre a un certo affiatamento e sincronizzazione nei movimenti, è necessaria una pianificazione comune della strategia, quest'ultima dipendente dalle caratteristiche dell'Antico. 
Un sistema di gioco diabolico: perdere da un giocatore è una cosa, perdere da un gioco inanimato è la cosa più frustrante che ci sia. 
Dopo anni di boardgame e qualche altra partita però emergono i difetti: la grandissima mole di regole e regolette, oltre a essere personalmente inaccettabile, rallenta il gioco in maniera eccessiva. Inoltre, il gioco risente del grande difetto di tutti i cooperativi: alla fine emerge un leader che dà ordini a tutti e trasforma la partita in un grande solitario. E poi, dopo diverse partite il gioco diventa più facile per i giocatori e necessita di espansioni che rendano più difficile il raggiungimento degli obiettivi. 
Infine, dopo aver provato altri giochi cooperativi, Arkham Horror passa da prima scelta a terza/quarta. 
Comunque sufficiente.

This is a *long* game (especially with the expansions), but it's a engaging and fun game, too.  Probably the best adventure-type game I've played.  With the expansions, it's sometimes frustrating, but that's in keeping with the Mythos theme, and part of its charm.  Excellent replayability, excellent production quality, cool theme, and lots of things to do make this one of the most-played games in my collection.

(If you find AH too easy after you've become experienced, I highly recommend the expansions.)

Took it at face value as an 8 player game. Not easy to get 8 people together for a day-long game! With 8 players, it just meant waiting around forever for the next person to have a turn. Incredibly complex, huge setup time, not much to like here.

Never again for me, but might play well with ~3-4 players.

Currently my favorite game. I just really enjoy everything about it. The theme, the complexity, the fiddliness. I love the setting, I love all of the investigator stories, I love the board and components. And I love the emotion that it has evoked in the groups I've played with. 

26/10/13 The more I play the more I see the problems with the game, namely that it is a problem you can solve. We rarely lose because the game is so manageable, but I'm reluctant to get more expansions that add more mechanics because the game is already borderline overwhelming for new people, which is the majority of who I get to play with. I still very much enjoy the theme and feel of the game and the story it tells, but most nights I'm finding I would rather play a game of Castles of Burgundy or Lords of Waterdeep with my wife than set this up and devote the time necessary to play it.

19/4/16 I really enjoy the experience and the story this game tells, but it has become a once or twice a year affair for me. I don't think I'll every get rid of it, but I don't want to play it any more often than that.

Requires a lot of time for set up & gameplay, a lot of space needed as well. Have only played several incomplete games. Solo gameplay is what initially attracted me to game. My experience has been more effort than return on fun. Game has great theme with good RPG'ish/social elements. With the right group of people this would make for a great night of gaming.

Always thought I would like this game and was not disappointed. It is one  dream of a cooperative 'ameritrash' boardgame! Strongly recommended for those who like Runebound, Shadows over Camelot or Fury of Dracula. Playing time increases not as drastically but slightly with the number of players (7-8 players not recommended) as the difficulty goes down. Takes some time to learn the game and get used to the mechanics - not for the impatient gamers.

I'm not a fan of co-ops in general, but this was worse than most.  Arkham features a ton of nitpicky rules that you can get wrong, monsters that seem completely unbeatable, and a crazy long play length.  At some point, I was just hoping the game would end, but it wouldn't.  The "boss battle" at the end was a nice touch, but it makes me wonder if players would be better off *trying* to speed up his appearance before they lost all of their stats and items.

[color=red]Soloable Game[/color]
Playtime: ~150 minutes. It varies so much that it can last 60 minutes to 210 minutes. Averages around 150 or so. 

Comment: Really digging this game more and more. It sat on my shelf for a few months before I could even figure out the rules. It's not hard once you've gotten it down, but man is there a ton of tiny rules to sift through. I've become known as the "Arkham Guy" since I've read the rulebook at least 5 times. Game is quite fiddly but it's great. Sit back and let the theme overtake you. Play it more for the experience than trying to win and you'll have a MUCH better time with the game. Roleplay your character a bit instead of playing optimally.

I do wish that they created a "2nd edition" of this game to clean up the Mythos cards, add some flavor text instead of "A monster appears!" and smoothed out how the expansions integrated. Eldritch is NOT the 2nd edition nor is it anywhere near as good.

Optimal Player Count: 4 > 5 > 3 > 2 > 6 > 1 > 7 > 8
Plays well with everyone as long as each person is paying attention and trying to get into it. More than 5 starts to drag if people aren't paying attention. Less than 4 starts to get really tough though.

Extras: FFG American Standard Sleeves on Location Cards. Have all but like 3 or 4 of the minis. I need to go through them soon and figure out the ones I'm missing. I'd love to finish off the remaining few. I also have Blessed/Cursed dice, regular arkham dice and a handful more extra dice to keep around the table. 

Note: This game is only a 10 with some of the expansions mixed in. The game by itself is more of an 8. Have all the expansions mixed in and depending on which I feel like, we can either remove or force events to happen via King in Yellow style. There is so much content with all the expansions it's hard to figure out where to even begin. I seriously doubt I will ever tire of this game. I just need to slowly craft the perfect game with the variants/rules/modules. So far my favorite is 1 large board and 1 small expansion. I really need to go through all the extras that the expansions brought to see what I like and what I don't.

Note 2: Have all the locations and Gate cards in a white card box. I use the app to not only reduce down the boxes that it's now contained in (2) but I use it to save table space and time. I might unsleeve the cards depending on how I feel and either sleeve the mythos deck or use those sleeves for another game.

Love this game but I don't think I could ever play with full expansions. Usually one extra board and a small expansion like King in Yellow does quite nicely for an afternoon/evening, or some other similar combination. Have just about managed to 'heath robinson' the boxes so the game can be played out of them to save space, as long as one or two players are willing to be readers (makes the game a little more dramatic). I keep mythos cards separate since not all expansions are played at once, in mythos phase the mythos player chooses  two numbers on a D6, if rolled then a mythos card for expansion board is pulled instead of a standard board one

I am not a huge fan of the fantasy and lovecraftian literature but I am a huge fan of this game.  The theme and mechanics are absolutely great in my opinion.  I was intimidated at first from all the negative reviews related to the rule book, but after playing the game a few times the rules go right along with the theme and make logical sense.  I also was apprehensive to purchase this game versus the eldrich horror game but I definitely prefer the city game instead of the global eldritch game.  I HIGHLY recommend this game!

It was said in some review that:"You don't play this game, the game play you". There is a point in that statement, but it is not the whole truth. There are still choices to be made and a high random factor in a game like this is not necessarily that bad thing after all. The theme of the game is nice...although to emphasize it, cards should be read aloud which may make the play time much longer (we usually just say what the effects of the card are).

After a few more games I decided to raise the rating from 7 to 8. Just because I don't have to take this game too seriously. Things just happens. So what. I try to stay sane and in good health. Please please please...give me one more success...5...too bad I'm cursed.

March 2010: I decided to raise my rating to 9. It's mainly because I'm beginning to remember all the rules, so that I can concentrate on the theme.

I loved the board, the theme, tension, the characters, and the cooperative play.  There were a lot of options and many ways to reduce the luck.  It was definitely a fun game.

My main concerns was that I felt there was way too many bits and things to keep track of during a game.  It felt a little overwhelming at first.  The game takes a little longer than hoped.

Also felt defeating the Ancient One after getting pounded most of the game felt odd.

Probably not a game to bust out too often depending on time and who's playing, however can be a blast if you have time and serious and fast gamers.

Bardzo ładna gra, która mocno trzyma poziom prozy, na bazie której powstała. Fajny jest aspekty współpracy między graczami przeciwko grze, która mimo wszelkich starań potrafi dokopać.
Za głównych zalet gry nalezy wymienić oprawę graficzną, klimat i niepowtarzalność rozgrywki, każdorazowo dobór postaci wymaga innego podejścia do próby pokonania przedwiecznego.
Minusów natomiast jest nieco więcej, czas przygotowania gry jest wyraźnie długi (multum kart, żetonów, rozkładania). Instrukcja jest mało przejrzysta. Przy jednej z dóch gier udało nam się dojść do momentu kiedy ani przedwieczny nei zbliżał się do przybycia ani baacze jakoś nie byli w stanie oddalić bardziej znacząco zagrożenia, to spory minus, przy tej okazji zabrakło mechanizmu, który zmusi graczy do sprężania się i wprowadzi element zagrożenia.

I've had this a week and a half.  Two 2P games and five solo games so far...  When I'm not playing it I often think of playing it.  It doesn't hurt that it inspired me to read (and re-read) some Lovecraft stories.  The theme makes this game awesome, and the game makes the theme shine. Current rating 8.5

Up to 9.5, I have so much fun playing this game!  21 games in just under two months, about half of them solo. Definitely the highest number of plays in that amount of time for any game I've owned.  All the more impressive because of the time commitment.

Back to a 8.5, been a while since I've been in the mood to break this one out... more likely haven't had the social opportunity.

Very complicated. Only been through it once. A lot of reviews are hit and miss, but one struck me pretty deeply. I can't remember which one it was, but they summed it up perfectly saying that it is very true to life, where as you don't have much control over what happens to you, you can have something horrible happen out of the blue at any time, and you still have to live with it and fight on.

Huge, fiddely, and awesome. Not to mention great bang for your buck. A great heavy thematic adventure co-op game that will get many, many plays. As excellent a solo game as it is with a group. Best with the expansions so save up your money. Download the excellent rules summary from headless hollow.

Not as random as people try to make it out to be as there are ways to mitigate luck in the game. Good team work so far has won us many a game, but sometimes things just don't work out. The game is definitely stacked against the players. Like Battlestar Galactica the game can fall flat sometimes depending on conditions and other times be an amazing experience. This can be remedied somewhat by playing select expansions and building your card decks.

also for this game and it's expansions a plano storage system will be your best friend.

edit: Well I've played this more than my count shows. I still think this is a great game, but it's large and takes forever to setup and breakdown. because of this I tend to play solo on vassal more these days. My wife prefers Eldritch horror over this game so I think Eldritch horror fired this one for us. 

I still like this one a lot so will continue to play with friends who have it or play on the computer, but I've now sold it off to people who will get it to the table more often.

Enjoyed this even more than I thought I would.  After getting Eldritch Horror I thought this might not have room in my collection but after playing it I honestly think they both have their own slot to fill.  I like the complexities that this adds and a lot of the mechanisms, but I could see where the streamlining they did was a good move. I unfortunately now know I want this badly...which means expansions too, and I still have two expansions to get for Eldritch.  Oh, poor me.

I have played this at my FLGS and at a gamer friend's house, but I had my own copy for 18+ months and never got it to the table (other than solo to try and get a handle on all of the rules). In the time that it takes to set up, teach, play, and tear down AH, I would rather play 2-3 other games. The Lovecraft theme doesn't do much for me, and the whole game seems like it's on rails most of the time (one guy gets money, one guy gets clues, one guy fights monsters, rinse and repeat).

Once onwned and sold it since it did not get played.
One more game that takes too long to get any playing time.
But it was fun both times I played it solo with 3 investigators.
And now with all the expansions I am tempted to buy it again...

I just read some suggestions for how to play solo with only 2 investigators. Sounds interesting. There was a lot of stuff to keep track of when playing with 3 characters and all their equipment.

Half a solo game with 2 investigators and then a full game. Only rule modification was to only draw a Mythos card if 1d6 showed 1-4. If 5-6 then then the Mythos phase was skipped. Nice learning game. Playing time 2,5h. A litle bit too easy still. Or the dice had a good night...

1st solo game with big expansion, Dunwich, and 3 investigators. Slow in the start but the flowchart is great for learning. In the end I did not need it. Very good story building game.

Love this game, it gets easier/takes less time as you get to know it better.  Definitely themey with a strong, urgent sense of impending doom.  I love that there are multiple valid strategies to win.  "Environment" and "Rumor" effects are sometimes hard to remember, but really help make every play very different.

For a long time my favourite thematic game. Then it was  overtaken by Mansions of Madness, and the Lord of the Rings LCG. And now I have a feeling it will be eclipsed by Eldritch Horror, which keeps all the fun bits of AH and cuts out pretty much everything that I found clunky or annoying. AH still has a place in my collection, partly out of nostalgia and partly because it has so much variability which EH will take a while to build up to.

Good atmosphere and a nice setup for social interaction, but as a game Arkham Horror does not deliver. It starts out OK, but once you manage to seal a few locations the game breaks and it becomes a cakewalk. But if you fail, at least the battle with the Ancient One is usually fun. How about a lighter game based just on that?

And the game is, of course, way too long.

I like the theme, I have read the books, I'm into RPGs, including CoC and I have a 7' dining table on which games can be left as long as needed so I have no problem with this as a solo experience, which it why I have bought it and all the supplements.
I also think it works well two player.
When there are more than two players, I am not so sure: there seems too much down time, Mansions of Madness works better with 3-6 players and bringing it to the table on a Friday night club session because it plays with 7 or 8 is far too optimistic because we usually only have about three hours for the main game. On the other hand I wouldn't say "no" (I am rating the game a 10!) and the guy suggesting AH doesn't have all the expansions so we can play just the core game without any effort.
I have bought the AH iPad app, so in theory it is easy to play with just the expansions that I want but I like holding real cards and rolling real dice - using the app feels like I am only pretending to play a game.

I'm not really one for 2-4 hour dice fests, but this one really tickles the thematic itch for me.  I like the way skill checks work, the randomness of things, and the way strategies change based on the ancient one, the # of players, and the mythos card draws.  Some initial rules exceptions will come up on the first few plays, but with the flow charts printed out (kudos to that guy) the game runs really smoothly even for new folks.  Also kind of cool in that you can start playing without explaining more than a few rules and as explanations are needed you can resolve them.

It's still early, but I've drunk the AH kool-aid, and have given it a 9.

Quickly becoming my favorite coop game. Hours and hours of fun around Arkham and in Arkham's known locations. As a person who read Lovecraft and played Call of Cthulhu in my youth this was a really fun game to play!

Complicated rules! Make sure you have friends that know the rules, and make your friends who think they know the rules but are wrong, shut up.

Finally played this classic.  Wish I had done this before playing Mansions of Madness.  The system is neither as long nor as junky as I'd been led to believe.  With a fun crowd, it's a fun, immersive experience.
Several pays later, I'm less enamored.  Pretty fiddly, and in ways that don't pay off for me.  Other co-ops work better for me.  I have the most fun watching gaming friends have fun playing it.

Arkham Horror can be hit or miss.  I've had games where it was immensely fun and we did alright or won, which, win-or-lose, is great.  I've also had games where everything went wrong and we had a shitty time, but that's how the game goes!  This game is more restricted thematic than, say, LoW or Last Night on Earth, where it really isn't as much "fun" for anybody not into the theme/Mythos.  The ups are worth it, despite the downs, and the social aspect of it all is fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The irony of why I give Arkham such a high rating while Android gets such a low one comes down to theme.  I can accept all the chaotic, maddening, unrelenting events occurring in Arkham Horror because as a player representing mere mortals, the idea of succeeding could only possibly happen by dumb luck where in all reality you would instantly be gobbled up... Game over. The ridiculous rules and chaotic events fit the theme perfectly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I will be the first to admit that my first impression of this game was not a good one.  The game took far longer than it should have, and the rules were murky at best.  Worse yet, after hours of play, we lost every game miserably.

I picked it up at a "going out of business" sale at my LGS, mostly because I am a big Lovecraft fan, and this would be the cheapest price I could hope to pay for this game. 

This time, I knew what to expect, and I was determined to get the rules down pat.  Focusing solely on playing the game right, we found ourselves memorizing more and more with each game.  Now, we have almost no need for the rulebook, and we can complete a game in 2 hours or less.  There is a steep curve here, but if you can climb that mountain, you will find a great treasure there.

One of the best board games I have ever played. You must play this with the right group of people though. My rating used to be a "10." However, the board I received with my game was substandard and flimsy. It broke easily and FFG's customer service has yet to respond. Bad company, good game.

I believe the new FFG version to be a very good game.  It's overflowing with atmosphere to draw you in, lots of randomness and made of excellent materials.  It is rather clunky the first play thru as you try to figure out everything that goes on, but rapidly speeds up as you reread the rules and grasp at what's going on.

RATING: 6.5
Drenched in theme, this is a luck-based RPG-lite that does a great job of walking through Lovecraft. I'm sure I like it more because I'm a fan of Lovecraft, but there's a good co-op game in here. It has lots of chaos, opportunities, and expandability to make it quite a good buy. If I were in college again, I'd certainly play this often. It has enough RPG to keep it replayable and enough combat to keep it challenging.

The true test that separates a "gamer" from a "non-gamer". Lots of rules and lots of exceptions. Dense, deep and thematically rich. The rule book needs a complete re-write - too many questions can only be answered in forums (ex: What is the difference between location, neighborhood and area? Answer: an area is any location including Other world spaces). Be sure to download the updated official PDF rules. Best to be seen as a gaming experience than a simple board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
We really like the feel of this game. The idea that we are running out of time, and monsters roam around keeps us very interested in the game. It is uncommon for a game to keep you interested in other people turns, but in this one is like watching a Lovecraft movie unfold, and that is pretty satisfying. We still need to play more and figure out some of the options of the game. We have yet to get a bank loan or get in the secret society. Lastly, despite how hard the game is, and the likelihood of us losing, that seems to be the core of cooperative games. Losing needs to be a constant reality for the game challenge to provide fun. Definitely a must buy for a full cooperative setting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you've read Lovecraft and play with a group that's read Lovecraft, the game can be very funny because the flavor text is such a perfect emulation of Lovecraft's literary style.  Nice pacing; the game starts slow and gets more frantic as it goes on.

I do worry that it will get old after a number of replays, but maybe not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game! While it stumbles about with theme, the game mechanics are superb at communicating a sense of hopelessness, disempowerment and doom. Things go from bad to worse in this pessimistic game and as such is a true Lovecraftian experience.

An entertaining game, but something of an unwieldy beast. Lots of dice, lots of rolling, lots of randomness. Some people feel that the game is pretty random with a lot of wasted action, but I feel you really need to get into the struggle of the game and glaze over its shortcomings a little in order to really enjoy it. Bonus points for the Lovecraft theme, even if the triumph of the players is really a contradiction of that same theme...

RATING: 8
After 5  plays now, and after teaching loads of new people on how to play and playing games with a varying number of players, I can honestly say that I enjoy this game.  The natural progression of 'easy to impossible' that this game provides is truly exciting.  Multiple plays will highlight a need for an occasional house rule to smooth out rough edges, and time required to complete a game is reduced through practise and/or 'quicker' endgame monsters.  The art is magnificent, the writing throughout each cards are fantastic, and there is an overall feeling of quality across every part of this game.  Another fantastic title from FFG.

Update:  I'm going to increase the rating on this one.. It's definately around that '8' level, as it's one of those games that I would just love to play but the circumstances have to be right.. namely, you ought to play with enough people who are generally interested in the theme, as well as being prepared for a very long game (3 hours at least), as well as being prepared for a lot of chits and fiddlyness (to a certain degree).

On the plus side, it's a good game for some solitaire if you want to give it a go.  I tried it once and it went very fast, destroying the old one and winning the game.  It was close, though.  In the solitaire aspect, it works and feels like reading a short story in a novel, only .. without the 'book' part.

As I play more, I become more and more interested, but must remain diligent on the fact that it's rare that I can get a good group of interested players together to play it.

RATING: 2.5
It was my first game after I got into board gaming. I tried to love, but it didn't love me back, although I gave it multiple chances, even after I got rid of it. I like Lovecraft Mythos, but I couldn't get into the theme enough during play, and without the theme this game is too long, too random, too boring, and (have I already mentioned it?) too long. It's, like, several minutes until it's your turn again and then nothing exciting happens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a lengthier and weightier game so I have a hard time getting people to play it, so thus far I've only managed to play solo. Loved it, though with just one investigator it's extremely difficult, if not near impossible, to win. The story and theme are really strong and it almost feels like if you fill in the gaps with some imagination, a play is akin to reading a Lovecraft novel. The mechanics and rules are a bit on the tedious side, but once you get them down they flow pretty smoothly.
As I understand it, the difficulty doesn't scale very well with different numbers of players. One or two players will find the game near impossible while five players and above might find it too easy. There are plenty of variations listed online though which help to adjust the difficulty though so this isn't so much of a problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros: Thematics and quality of game components are great and it does a good job of conveying the hopeless "You are about to be eaten and/or driven insane" atmosphere of the Cthulhu mythos. Cooperative game too if that's your speed.

Cons: Very long and if you have a lot of players it has a lot of downtime while you wait for others to complete their turns. As a result it can be a long slog.  

Overall: Ok game but definitely not for everyone. I'd play it if my regular group wanted to, but I wouldn't buy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy playing this game.  The cooperation element is quite splendid, and without working together the investigators will be mauled.  Some games just seem to be easier than expected, while others are a bear just to survive and close one gate, but each time is different, something hard to ensure in a game where you are all playing against the game.  It is a bit longish and fiddly, really something I've almost come to expect from any Fantasy Flight game of this size.  It takes a few games to get comfortable with the amount of stuff that's going on at one time, and even more games to make sure you have all the rules right.  Of it's genre (co-operation games), I think it's right up there with Lord of the Rings as one of the best.  There's more theme here than in Lord of the Rings, but you definitely pay for it with added complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun co-op game that doesn't require a GM or someone to take on the "evil" side. Great theme integration. Has a crazy amount of cards, but that helps increase the replayability as you're never quite sure what is coming next.

WARNING: This can be a very long game, although it usually remains fun for most of the duration.

WARNING: Rules are lengthier than needed, and poorly organised. There are some excellent play aids on BGG.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite games.  The components are excellent, great theme and artwork, and the co-op experience is always a treat.  The base game is lacking in encounter cards, which is made up for in the numerous expansions.  On its own though, the game would get repetative after a few sessions.  Fairly easy to beat as well, but the difficulty increases dramatically in the expansions to a 50/50 at least.

Ignore the horror stories of how long this game is. Sure, it can be long, but the pace of the game is really up to the spirit of the players. This game allows for lots of storytelling and role play opportunities, or you can throw it down and shoot for a high score. 
It has high replay value and excellent thematic elements.

An awesome experience. Gameplay is brutal and certainly gives you the feeling that you are struggling against the awakening of a great and powerful being. Particularly love the descriptions in the otherworld encounters. My main gripes with this game are that some actions on the board feel as though it is never justified to spend the time doing them instead of other actions (e.g. buying items at the shop, or spending more than one turn healing sanity/stamina) and that I wish the original had come with a greater number of encounter cards for variety.

Loads of fun, but pretty random. That said, experienced players will find this one pretty easy to beat 75% of the time without expansions once you get to know the encounters (and get lots of Elder Signs!) Good if you like role-playing and getting into character as it is rich in theme.

Recreates the feeling of hack and slash table top RPGing.  Unfortunatly, once you "get it," the game becomes a bit too easy.  Each expansion does ramp up the difficulty a bit, so this does help.  Also, the rules are convoluted and don't quite cover all situations.  For instance, there's a card you draw every turn and resolve in this order: bottom left, bottom of the central text after the bold heading, bottom right, top of the central text (not kidding).  The second printing of the game solved many of these issues.  Despite the game's drawbacks, this is one I've played several times and enjoyed.

I've been a fan of H.P. Lovecraft for a long time. When my friend introduced me to this game, I was stunned. Fight the elder gods, collect stuff, and see your characters story to resolve through cards and actions. I was sold completely after one game. It was so good actually, that we stayed up all night and played another game, after watching the movie Dagon. Call it a Cthulhu night if you wish.
I give it 9. It is simply awesome. I would give it a 10, but it still has it's bad moments. It takes long to set up, and it has some flaws in mechanics.

An incoherent jumble of elements from the Cthulu mythos that at least manages to capture the right feel.  Ostensibly a cooperative game, but players don't work together so much as simply win or lose collectively.  One of Fantasy Flight Games' finer works nonetheless.  A missed opportunity.  If you own a copy anyway, try the "Arkham Investigations" variant for a choose-your-own-adventure game with an underlying (coherent!) plot.

Played twice now and definitely looking forward to playing again. Love the dice rolling and role-playing. Have no problem with it being to easy. Especially because I like to play it with just my wife. And it isn't to easy with just us!

Edit: Dropping the rating quite a bit. It is a great concept. But there is a critical problem with it. Any game that gets interupted for approximately half its playtime looking up the rules is a BIG GIANT BUZZKILLER. If your game is dripping with theme and all about the experience, but your flow of gameplay is so broken up that you don't actually experience it, then your game kind of sucks.

To play Arkham Horror is always a big event full of fun. Usually we gather in the evening around dinner time and continue playing until the small hours of the night or later. I love it that everything is so random, yet strategy matters so much. Passing or failing a skill check can make drastic changes to the course of the game and you'll have to be aware of the times where you can't have the game to change in the other direction. Yes, this is shitty abstract nonsense. But you know what I mean when the difference is to be devoured or have that terrifying monster off the board!

The base game offers already a lot of versatility, but this is greatly increased to huge amounts by the big box expansions, while the small ones offer some nice change of flavor. I prefer the game with one big box and a small expansion in play, but that causes the necessity to separate the cards after each session. Anyway, it's more than great!

Long set-up and take-down times bother me none.  It is the story-telling aspect that attracts most of the attention for me.  It has been an issue every now and then for me to convince others to play because of the set up and play time.  Once they sit down to play it is engaging enough for them to remain happy/content.  Inertia issue I guess with non-gamers.

I have wanted to try this game for some time and i got into a game after someone left. I really like cooperative games and this is one that has alot of good elements. For my first game I entered a game that had all the expansions added to it and i was overwhelmed by the fiddliness of the game which was probably exacerbated by the expansions. I had to go home before it finished it was taking a long time. I really hate downtime but i felt involved in other peoples actions so it wasnt too bad. The theme is strong and most of the mechanics suited the theme. Now i need to play this without the expansions to see if it is more enjoyable.

A fantastic game, with a solid, brilliant theme(although I am a sucker for H.P. Lovecraft, it's all presented very very well,) excellent co-op mechanics and a simple enough base system to allow for practically infinite additions. All the art is absolutely gorgeous, and it's difficult enough to pose a challenge to a group of gamers for the first while(after that, expansions ratchet up the difficulty even more)

[FFG Edition] A bit too long and a bit too complex for what it is (very lucky based), but very interesting. It seems a bit too much on the easy side for the players. Good artwork.
The theme is really inspiring, but in my opinion it is far from the Lovecraft universe. I mean, the background is ok, but 'heroes' in Lovecraft's novels are desperate people who dies-as-flies or fall into madness without recover, while in this game they are ultra-powered-up machines which handle Ancient Monsters loaded with spells and guns...!

The first time I played this game, I thought it was great...
Now, after I played it about 50/60 times and having tried many other games, I changed my mind: this isn't my favourite type of game but there are many other coop games better than this one.In addition there are many other games who have a lovecraft's theme...

Finally had a game where I didn't have a headache at the end!  I'd like to play this more often, but it's complex and can get challenging when you have to manage some people who have not played before.  Good large group game though if you have 5-7 people and no other games that can hold that many.

After some time and reflection, I've dumped this game. After a few plays, it became the same every time. They threw all of Lovecraft's works into a blender and made rules for it. A game this the,attic should have way more story to it.

Big, complex, but quite cool. Nice that it's got a solo playability, and the co-operative factor is cool, too.

RATING: 6
A game that you either love or hate. I love it.
It's just fun. Each time it's an adventure, an experience, and players need to be in the mood to get immersed into it.
Because it's fiddly and requires players to act as a team.
Long ? Yes, but once players are used to it, it's not that long. We are usually 3 or 4 players, the first games took around 4 hours each, but now we tend to end up in about 2 and a half hours without hurrying at all, which is okay for us.
We don't play it that often anymore but we keep enjoying it.
My main complaint is that it gets too easy to beat once you have fully understood it. We lose the first 4 games, but from then on, we win almost every time, so we had to introduce some house rules to make it more challenging. I think it just lacks of a simple system for adjusting the difficulty level (like Pandemic for instance).

I still have fun with this game, even though I have found other cooperative games I enjoy more. I probably would have this lower, but nostalgia keeps it alive a bit for me.

I've only played once, and it was an interesting (but long) experience. Here's the one problem I noticed - ideally you want someone experienced to teach you how to play the game because it is fairly complicated. However, that's a double edged sword as you can rely heavily on their advice to make the proper move in this co-op game which may take a bit away from the experience.

If we have the time, I'll rarely turn down a game of Arkham. It's the second co-op board game I played, after Pandemic. It's the first co-op board game I played that made me realize how much I adore being part of a team, taking on an anonymous, insurmountable force.

The game that got me hooked into the hobby, wouldn't be here without it.

I bought Arkham Horror for the role-playing and cooperative aspects of the game. Though I have enjoyed every session that I play, it does get a little tiring in the later half of the game.

31/08/2007: 
Downgraded rating from 7.5 to 5.25, due to lack of play and interest.

06/02/2013: Upgraded to 7, as I am picking up this game again in view of my wife's interest in  playing it. The game is really challenging given the rate of monsters and gates spawning, while there is a time pressure to get better-armed to deal with the tougher monsters
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It's the absolute most amazing game, a must buy for true rpg fans of horror-themed games!

The base game alone warrants tons of replayability (we've played it over 10 times with no sign of slowing down. That's practically 35 hours of game so far!)

Scales well from 2-5 players.

RATING: 10
My favourite Boardgame. I have been playing it solitaire mostly and with others a few times. The theme is amazing (Lovecraft Ho!) and the game mechanics too. There is a lot of random stuff going on, which ties in nicely with the chaotic theme of the Cthulhu mythos, although I know a lot of Eurogamers who would not enjoy this. The expansion packs turn this into a huge game and it can easily compete with Descent in terms of scope. Only drawback, if you play with more than four players it gets a bit too long and confusing. Also, if you are not in the right mood, play with the wrong people or in the wrong place, all the "flavour" of the game might not come through. 

EDIT: I have played this twice with groups who did not enjoy it or found the experience boring, and it dragged my experience and joy down with it and I have to say, this game is a definite 10 for me IN THEORY. When played with the wrong group, this can be one of the worst games ever.

I mean, I don't even know what to say here. This is the best game ever made. I always want to play it. It's the most atmospheric game I've ever played, and the one with the most consistent replay value -- it's different every time. There are numerous strategies to win, numerous ways to lose, and people are always forced to take different strategies depending on what character they receive, what possessions they have, and just some general luck. A++++++.

RATING: 6.5
Arkham Horror is one of the best adventure games out there.  It's also one of the best cooperative games.  I'm not a huge cooperative game fan, but this game is so baroque in it's design it's easy to get lost in.  That's a good thing.

During the game, players wander around the town of Arkham trying to keep some big bad monster from materializing.  They do this by fending off monsters, collecting useful items and traveling through dimensional portals to seal off otherworldly gates.  If the big bad guy does materialize the players will have to fight it.  There are plenty of references to a wide variety of H. P. Lovecraft's creations.

Does it feel very H. P. Lovecraft-y?  I'm going to have to answer, no.  Sure it's got Cthulhu, et al.  But  Lovecraft's stories follow a pretty rigid formula.  They typically involve some nebbish intellectual getting far too interested in some mysterious occurrence.  He'll typcially uncover some horror man was not meant to know.  If he survives, his sanity suffers.

In Arkham Horror, the characters vary wildly from mobsters to sales-men.  More focus is placed on adventuring rather than trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.  This makes it feel more like "The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath", a Dreamlands story, than one of Lovecraft's better know works.  This, in turn, is somewhat ironic considering the Dreamlands get such short shrift in Akham Horror and it's expansions.  Though perhaps that will change in the future.

And for those that complain about fending of Cthulhu with a shot gun, have you ever read "Call of Cthulhu"?

I really do enjoy this game, but it can be SUCH a slog to play or to even get through for that matter.  Everyone has to be in the mood, plus everyone needs to be willing to dedicate a huge chunk of time to play it.  Usually those stars do not come into alignment, and the game is overlooked.

Also its "winability" comes into play a lot as well.  The likelihood of you actually winning a game of Arkham Horror is generally slim, though not impossible, and no one wants to play a co-op game where failure is almost certain.

RATING: 7
I appreciate a game with a good theme, and this game oozes theme.  The lovecraftian theme is extremely well developed and is appealing to a wider base of gamer.  This is not your generic fantasy rpg boardgame, it is filled with characters players can relate too and monsters that capture the imagination.  That being said, it's a pretty detailed game, and you'll pay for that detail with increased length of gameplay and complexity of rules.  This means your casual gamer friends will potentially be turned off, and it will potentially lead to unfinished games. I suggest luring them into the game with the theme first, saving details for later. The cooperative nature of the game is a key selling point as well, as it makes learning-while-you-play a viable option. Update: Unfinished games DO happen!  But I have never been disappointed!  Also, changed to a 9...it's just really a fun game once you get the hang of it! Update: Changed rating to a 10.  I never get tired of this game...I only wish I had the new reprinted board!

Arkham Horror reminds me of a game I adored in my childhood: Talisman, in that the basic principle is to fight monsters and find equipment and items to power up your character enough to face the final challenge.  It differs in that this is a cooperative game, and it is far more complex.  The complexity does not lie in difficulty so much as the incredible number of things to remember.  This game is also quite lengthy, which is fine for some groups, but mine prefers games that can be played in an hour or so.  We like to play multiple games in an evening, and Arkham Horror likes most of an evening to itself.  Unfortunately, the ending isn't much of a payoff either.  In Puerto Rico or Agricola, one builds an entire colony or farm throughout the game, and at the end, you can look it over and feel a sense of accomplishment.  You can see all the pieces of your 'machine' and get a feel for what worked and what didn't.  That sort of visceral satisfaction simply doesn't occur at the end of Arkham Horror, at least not for us.  I've heard a number of great things about this game, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.

Setup takes almost as long as the game, unless you've got it streamlined.  Without location and other world cards from an expansion, encounters in Arkham seem to be more dangerous than in the Other Worlds, which is odd.

I've found I enjoy the game with only 1 expansion at a time.

I need to get this on the table with more people, i.e., not just a solo play. I love the mechanics and the theme, but the solo thing is not for me.

This is a tough game to rate. On the one hand, the components are excellent, the theme is great, the mechanics good, but it's the LENGTH!!! Good god, the length is simply too long for what gameplay there is. If your plans were that important/strategic, that would be one thing - but the overwhelming luck kinda makes the long gametime play hollower than the fun it provides. While I can live with the dicerolls overwhelming the tactics, I think it's the lack of balance in the equipment cards that is the game's Achille's Heel. You could do the exact same sequence of character actions in 2 different games, and the results for one would be a very capable character, but the other (with bad equipment draws) would be useless.

Tried playing this at Gencon a couple years back. One guy read the insane rules while the rest of us played Magic (DC10) on the board.

Having only played a couple of times, I may have ranked this higher than I should have. I had a great time playing it each time and loved the "we're getting a butts handed to us" rollercoasting with the "oh my god that was close" feeling.

 I want to get this, but one group I play with has it, and I don't think the other group would like it enough.

* * * UPDATE * * *

Still have only played twice, but have been reading a lot of the threads here about it. I can see how people are saying that the gameplay can almost be pre-dictated for you, but I still need a few more games now that I have these thoughts. 

* * * UPDATE #2 * * *

OK, I played this a third time with 6 people and the Dark Pharoh expansion mixed in. The cards were eally with us, as almost everyone had 1 or 2 weapons, and there were 2 Elder Signs to start off. I think it was Yig we were facing. Anyways, gates were opened and easily closed (by others). I had the Shotgun and a  5 magic weapon, but no clues, so I was basically the street cleaner. We soon had 4 gates closed and every gate afterwards that would have opened was prevented. We called it a game. The cards were both with us to win, but against us to make it interesting.

To sum up, I have lowered my ratings by 1. I will still play the game, and hope to with Dunwich, but I now see the flaws in the game.

RATING: 7.5
I was only able to play a few rounds, so I can't fairly judge the game's middle and end. The professor who can cast all the simple spells free, and take on any moderate dangers fearlessly, seemed rather unbalanced to me, but perhaps the fact that all the rest of the characters were struggling to get anything at all done makes up for it. I hope to play this game again soon, in full, since it does seem like a load of fun.

RATING: 6
A fun co-op game that seems to be just as chaotic as the inner minds of our H.P Lovecraft. Tons of replay value, but our group seems to find almost every Horror easy to win against, we wind up "punching it awake" and murdering the hell out of it. Certainly, this game is much more difficulty with only 2-3 players.

Long set up/down time which makes this game less of an incentive to play.

One of the most out-and-out fun games I've ever played. Mechanically, it's not so intense, but it's a wild ride the whole way through! Better with the expansions which add more and more variety.

RATING: 8
A big board. Lots of cards, bits, and dice rolls.  Once you get past the first game and the learning curve, you find a game that can be challenging and arbitrarily punishing, yet can be played without a great deal of concentration and intensity.  Losing to an awakened Elder God wasn't so bad as you might believe. I felt more closure that way, actually.

Update. Still not played this game. I have vast knowledge of the play turn and overall rules but its just so damn big and its going to take time to ween the family onto this. I'm not in a hurry though , so many people have rated this as a great game. I am trusting their judgement and keeping it for now.

Thank you Mike,still.

RATING: 6
Resembles the Call of Cthulhu RPG more than it does traditional Lovecraft fiction, but is still a good game nevertheless. If it wasn't for the big learning curve (and innate fiddliness), I would probably rate it higher. Excellent production values, despite the cluttered-looking board.

Daunting at first glance, but becomes addicting if this is your kind of game. Solo-able and Co-op VS the board that will always keep you on your toes!!

Also VERY Modular, can adjust the game easily to make it more harder or easier, or just more balanced in general.

RATING: 8
fun game. don't play with too many players. i know the box suggests that up to 8 players can play, but the resulting game would be too long and monotonous. as with a lot of games, 4 seems to be a pretty good number. more later.  

my one biggest complaint about the game is that somehow the rulebook becomes more horribly organized the more familiar you are with the rules. i might sit down one day and re-write them from beginning to end in order to minimize all the page turning and digging around for rules. 

o.k. so it's been a while and i've gotten a few plays of this under my belt. i still dig this game. whenever i get in the mood to draw some cards and roll some dice for a few hours, i'm reaching for this game. (i can just hear some of you gasping.) anyway, i don't understand the complaints about this coming down to a dice fest during the endgame. um, what? what do you want to do instead? would you rather collect sets of cards until the monsters die of boredom?  would you rather consult a crt? the combat system through out the game is clever and original. players have to spend the game preparing themselves for the end fight, while trying to prevent the ancient one from appearing at all. all in all i think  this facet of the game keeps game-play tense and interesting. i just don't think there is any other mechanic that could be substituted for die rolling that could generate the same amount of uncertainty needed to keep the game tense.

The ultimate adventure game. There's only one problem - it's so long I never EVER have time to play it.

UPDATE: Dusted it after like what, 2 years...? To be honest, it didn't thrill me. Felt sluggish, dull and drawn-out. No real narrative and many little details to remember. Would be fine if it didn't overstay its welcome. Granted, we played with two newcomers, so we had to explain the rules and the flow was far from natural, but not much excited me anyway. Felt forced after our recent experience with "A Touch of Evil", a lot faster, but still amazingly fun game with some interesting decisions.

RATING: 6
First impressions after just one play: Well despite the fact that most people seem to like the chrome of this game, I don't, even though I like the Lovecraft books a lot. Your options look quite limited, desicion making is pretty obvious and it takes forever to finish. Never felt like battling the horror of Arkham but run around, draw cards and eventually win (there was some tension in the endgame)...

RATING: 8
I feel this game captures the feeling  of Cthulhu mythos better than Eldritch Horror. The mood and theme is great but rules and mechanics are a bit heavier and clunkier, which is why I nowadays prefer Eldritch Horror for my Cthulhu fix. Still Arkham Horror is a great game.

RATING: 8
A classic amongst the co-op games, the theme is great, and the work that has gotten into this is impressive. Not as hard as it might seem at first. Gorgeous art on the cards, pity the map is so bland. ONly big downside of the game: the complexity of the rules somtimes, you can't play this one without a good summary of the rules.

Look at my number of plays. Now look at when I added this to my collection (around when I rated it), now back to my number of plays. That isn't a mistake, I don't always faithfully record my plays but Arkham Horror has hit the table in my old apartment once, and in my now house once. Two times. In five years.

For me, Arkham Horror is a cautionary tale: I should not purchase extremely heavy, lengthy games, that swim or drown based on their theme. Now, if this is you, future David, reading over your collection comments repeat after me: YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON YOU KNOW THAT LIKES THIS SORT OF GAME. DO. NOT. BUY. THEM.

If you aren't future David and Arkham Horror intrigues you, I would advise you to consider carefully. Arkham Horror is really cool, it combines the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft with a fantasy adventure game. However, it is extremely complex, takes forever to play (especially, I understand if you have expansions), and is a bitch to run if you aren't intimately familiar with the minutia of the rules, not to mention pretty damn difficult. But it's fun. Our first game (50% of my entire experience with it) involved us sorta dressing up like people from the 20's, speakin' in tarible' accents, dah'lin, and sipping apple juice like it was scotch (I was poor at the time and not all of us could drink, also we're total dorks). This immersion made it way more fun than it actually was (though it was pretty fun). So... read over the rules... carefully, peruse some images and check out some video reviews before you decide to tackle this monstrosity.

It's too dry and old for me. They should have included a player-depending rule update for monster limits etc. I am saving the money for Eldritch Horror which shall be better, I hope.
Eldritch Horror superseeded AH for me. But once in 2 years or so I like to return to AH for nostalgia reasons.

Excellent cooperative card-driven board game set in HP Lovecraft's Cthulu universe. The players must work together to stop the town of Arkham from being overrun by otherworldly demons before a randomly selected Old One awakes and destroys it. Lots of fun to play even if you are not familiar with the setting.

RATING: 8.5
I've grown to like this game with the right crowd. Of course, it takes a fairly long session to play and is not really about winning, but seeing what happens. The multiple expansions can be used on and off, mixed together etc. so you can really theme the game in a number of ways. The biggest gripe for me is the long setup time, but even that can be lessened by organizing the bits and pieces in a better way.

The game oozes replayability in a nice scale. The different Great Old Ones and Investigators always change the game a bit. Add in expansions, mix a few together etc. and the game varies greatly.

A technical tour de force; you are at the mercy of a ruthless machine here. A tough game, at times, but one of the very best "experiences" I own.

RATING: 5
If you are looking to play this game like you would play chess, stay far away. This is a hot mess of rules, die rolls, skill checks and modifiers. There is a huge amount of things to keep track of. You have your boss counter, monster limit, gate limit, outskirts limit, rumors, curses, blessings, retainers and terror levels to keep in mind as you play. The sheer amount of content in this game is staggering. You have 16 highly detailed characters with their own stats in the 6 areas: speed, sneak, will, fight, lore and luck. You have unique starting items, heart/brain numbers and of course powers. Each character also has a cool backstory on the back of the sheet. There are tons and tons of cards. There are spells, common items, unique items, allies and memberships. And there are quite a number of encounters you get when you draw one for your turn to ensure replay value. This game is a total beast. Why do I like it? Well I for one appreciate the massive amount of things to go through. I like playing a new character and feeling how differently it goes. Or trying a new boss to take on. Maybe this game, the game will be easy and the town will be saved. Maybe next game will have us on our knees with the baddies never letting up. You have to appreciate randomness to play. This is a true American style game.

This game would be more enjoyable if it were shorter.  Even so, it's a pretty good game.  I love the choose your own adventure style of the gameplay, and I love the large number of character choices and bad guy choice because they make Arkham Horror into a game with a lot of replayability.

But I don't like the tedious gameplay.  I feel like I'm moving bits around just to around bits.  Read the cards in this order and follow a prescribed routine doesn't appeal to me.  Plus, the story aspect should be the most important part of Arkham Horror and I have a hard time getting into the story.

Very long and involved.  It plays more like a classic RPG than a board game.  It's quite an adventure, if you have the time and can wade through all of the rules and cards.  I think this would work better as a computer game; less card/token management, less rule confusion, and less time (or more games in the same time).  It's something I'm glad I've now experienced, but for such a serious time commitment, there are other games I'd rather play.

*Recently upgraded after playing with Dunwich Horro Expansion!*

Damn you, Arkham, I want to like you more.  D&D without the imaginary landscape and uber-nerdiness, but it's just so fiddly.  This is guaranteed: if you have a new player in the game or the 'game master' hasn't played in a while, expect to spend 50% of time trying to find the special conditions and obscurities in the rules in just about every phase of a round.  

In addition, the base game is broken.  When you start to progress in sealing gates, the difficulty REDUCES as you get closer to the end.  You can be left with 1-2 hours of chore-like clean-up when victory is guaranteed.  House rules for getting more monsters on the board are needed or potentially the Dunwich expansion helps solve the issue by allowing sealed gates to burst open.

This game surprised the hell out of me.  I had looked through reviews and pictures of this game thinking I wouldn't enjoy it at all, and then picked it up on a lark while on a gaming weekend at a friends house.  It seemed like the group of people was just right to try this out, so we did, and we weren't dissapointed.

It feels a bit fiddly at times, with all the different steps to the turn, etc.  Once you master those though, it was a pretty good time.  It is a little frustrating that the spell casters don't seem to hold a candle to the fighters in this game, but oh well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very challenging game dripping with theme.The production values here are through the roof, with beautiful boards and cards throughout. 

Setup time is pretty steep since the expansions introduce a lot of customization to the game. Actual playing time ranges from moderate to extremely lengthy depending on if players read aloud all the story/flavor text.

As with any dice game, there is a high luck factor. This works well with the Cthulhu theme though, as players find themselves getting cursed and pummeled into insanity.

RATING: 9
I love games that tell a story, especially ones that inspire me to tell stories after the event. This one always seems to do so.

There is a popular saying around this game that "the game knows." Just when you think you've got the winning move, the game hits you with your worst nightmare, throwing you into the oblivion.

Sometimes (rarely) just when you think you're on the cusp of losing, along comes something that swings the game back in your favour.

Mechanically there are flaws and it takes an age to setup, play and pack away again, but when you get those moments where everything flows together to create a cinematic event that you remember for a lifetime, there's little that can match it.

RATING: 6
Great theme and mood, nice bits, some interesting gameplay. Unhappily, I get the feeling that most of the first half of this long game isn't very important to the outcome; and the rules are so complex that I feel like much of the play is just "turning the crank." Too much time spent looking up rules and their weird and subtle interactions, which ruins the mood. I think this is not a game for casual play: you have to play it often enough to become very familiar with it. I like it, but not that much. (Also, although this is my favorite cooperative game, I'm just not a big fan of cooperative games.)

Enjoyable at first, though it has become a bit overblown.

I initially bought the game because I love the Lovecraft Mythos, and it was fun to explore through the medium of board games.  However, the randomness of the game leads to nonsensical story lines as often as it leads to interesting ones.  This is something that has been addressed in Eldritch Horror by using specific themed decks.

Setup time has always been too long, and the addition of expansions just make it worse.

I would recommend trying the campaign rules that can be found online if you have the time.  It will take you through the majority of the content and is quite enjoyable.

Long Epic of a co-op game. If that sounds good then this should be for you. Frequent use of dice and cards gives a high luck element, but you can't truely die before the end of the game so at least no-one will be forced to sit out the game while everyone else finishes. Downtime can be an issue in larger games; I actually prefer this two-player, running two characters each as it gives a nice balance of options & interactivity.

A great co-op horror game. It always seems like we're on the brink of destruction in this game, which is good for a Lovecraftian game. However, we've won our last 6 games so we'd like to turn the challenge up a bit.

I finally got a good play of this game in. It was jumbo-epic. It was so much fun. They people I played with were great and we got into the game and roll-played a little bit. I realize that this comment doesn't really say anything in detail about the game, but that isn't important right now. What IS important is that you play this game and play it often.

Fantastic theme - an utter chore of a game unfortunately. Lots of bits, slow, uninspired mechanics, too much downtime, surprisingly non-cooperative (why can't you battle together?), 90% of the game is irrelevant to the central need to get clue tokens ASAP and close gates. BORING.

Why not play a better board game? Or an RPG?

Finally got a play in with my kids.  The bad news: the rule book is poorly organized and will require frequent [constant] reference during first game or two.  The good news: lots of great player aids in the BGG file section + AH is one of those games that require only one player to have the rules down (but that player needs to have them grokked solid) for it to be fun for everyone else.  Game can run a bit long - must admit in the last play i was looking forward to the GOO finishing us off.

Played this once, not really sure what to make of it.  Although there were a few moments of intense drama and humour I also found it largely drawn-out with several periods of simply wanting to get it over with.  This was a first time play for at least three of the seven players and there was a lot of unrelated cross-table chat making it difficult to follow what was going on.  So although this particular play might rate in the 5-6 range I can see potential for this game in the 7-8 range. (2008 SEP 01)

Wow Arkham Horror! This was the first board game I played as an adult and the one that got me hooked. After this I bought every expansion as they came out and I think I would have rated it a 10 back then! It certainly got me into board games and for that alone it will always be well thought of.

The theme is brilliant and the mechanics in the base game - sound enough. It really is one of the most epic games available I think.

But even in its most basic form it is epic - there's a lot of rules and things that need to be done. It can take hours and sometimes you doom yourself in the first thirty minutes but it takes another hour before you lose. As an epic sweeping tale it is great but its not very practical and as I result I almost never play it now. Each expansion adds even more rules and things to do and even the base game takes up a huge space - with the expansions lets just say I hope your partner doesn't mind you taking a lot of space up!

If you have the time and desire it is unsurpassed as an epic thematic experience but games have evolved over the years and Arkham Horror I think is a crucial part of board game history that has since been surpassed by those who learned from it including its own successor of sorts - Eldritch Horror.

If you get trapped on an island though take this and all the expansions!

Like Runebound, this game takes a great idea and tacks on all kinds of fiddly mechanims which eventually bog the game down to the point that it's just not fun.  If I wanted this level of die rolling, bookkeeping, and fiddling around with a million cards and bits I would play an RPG or some old-school 1970's wargame.  I would absolutely love to like this game.  Really I would.  But it's basically like playing Runebound in Hell.

The best H.P.Lovecraft-inspired game around!  All players must work together to stop an ancient evil from awakening.  Extremely challenging, even against the "easier" ancient ones.  The learning curve is steep, but game play picks up after a few attempts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Awesome game. Love the artwork, quality of the pieces and huge variety of monsters and investigators that comes with the basic game. The loads of pieces and card that comes with this game give the impression that it already has some expansions, but it is just simply very complete.  

The thing i did not like is the not so very clear rulebook. It's covered mostly everything, but some rules or situations is just frakkin hard to find. Especially the first game is gameboard horror. 

+ This game is great when you like playing together against the board and developing a nice storyline. 

- The game is not so great when you are into tactics and hours of scanning the board for the best possible move.

My friends and I are casual board gamers, and so this took a few games to get the game mechanics right and 
remember all the different rules.  Which at first turned me off the game due to its complexity and led to some random game play to start with.
It's this very complexity that has increased the game longevity and made it one of our favourites as no 2 games are the same.
Great fun & well worth it, would highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a compelling cooperative game with a couple of hours spare.

You need to be able to invest the time in playing this game.

I like the game but i get the same fun from Eldritch Horror which for me has replaced this game.

A good game, but it has its downsides. First, I don't really feel in control of what happens in the game. I admit that fits the theme, but I'd rather a game help me create a story rather than force one on me. Secondly, this game is LONG! I've had games last over four hours. On the positive side, though, this game really excels at creating that creepy, distinctly Lovecraftian atmosphere. It really does feel like your characters are all that stands between humanity and unfathomable madness from beyond the gulfs of time and space!

(3/4/08) - Just bought this today from SpellBound, an LGS. Great price on it too!

(4/21/08) - [9] - After 3 plays I'm confident that this is an excellent game. I took a chance on this one, since I previously was primarily a Euro guy. This game has made me much more apt to play "Ameritrash". Further plays will most likely warrant an even higher score.

(09/21/2014) - [7] - Having been so long since I have played Arkham Horror, I sadly must revise my rating. I have forgotten most of the rules, so the barrier to playing again has become much greater. Good memories though.

SOLD - (04/11/2017) - Sadly, Arkham Horror and its myriad expansions have been sold. I have not played any the base game or its expansions in years, and with the streamlining that Eldritch Horror brought to the family, I didn't foresee these titles getting to the table ever again.

I particularly enjoy the narrative aspect of this game. I'm not even much for Lovecraft - there's a strong "Mythos" constructed by and around his works that's more compelling as an idea than anything he's ever written, I think. But that's more a comment on him than the game! It has a tendency to go longer than my desire to play it.

Oh, Arkham Horror. I give it a 9, well, because its too good.  :P

1) Arkham is co-op, but don' let this fool you. It is one of the best board games ever made.

2) Not for casual gamers. Huge investment of time both learning the game and each time you play it.

3) Errata almost mandatory. Look it up after your first or second game. 

4) The BEST physical construction of any game ever. The board, cards, chits and pieces are IMMACULATE. The Monster tiles are out of this world good. 

5) It took us 3 days to learn the rules. The whole weekend, I am not kidding. Better to play with ppl who already know how to play :) Or watch online tutorials first.

6) You will need to take notes, and organize them, to play the first few times. Keep them for reference. Maybe soon I will make cheat sheets for you :P

7) I have never regretted buying Arkham Horror, even though it was over 50 bucks, even though almost no one ever wants to play it twice, even though we have only played it 4 times and even though we have only finished a game once...

8) I have never regretted it. The physical quality alone is worth owning it. I open the box and SHOW it off to more people than ever end up actually playing it. And they always go wide-eyed and "Woooowwwww..."

9) A nice copy of Arkham is required for any serious board game collection or anyone serious about co-op board games, period.

It's playtime is good too, it takes a bit of time to play (never mind setup) which gives everyone an investment in the game. 

It's a game I really do enjoy and don't get enough opportunity to play!

Excellent, RPG as a boardgame. 

Probably too much chrome for gamers who like elegance and too much randomness for those who like strategy. 

However if you want a deep, thematic solo game that allows you numerous interesting choices every turn this is for you.

Minus 1 for too much maintenance dice rolling, Minus 1 for not enough Arhkam encounter cards (however the Mythos and exploration cards are wonderfully deep). Pluses on everything else. An extra .5 for being a solo enabled game put out by a big publisher and for being a good meaty old school game in an age of lighter designs.

Highly reccomended for solo gamers who are also Cthulhu RPG fans, hey thats me :)

Bring on the expansion packs.

For me, complex to the point of confusion and tedium. We always seem to spend at least fifteen minutes on set-up and fifteen minutes plodding through rules refreshers.  Then, gameplay itself is slow and long, and it's always seemed to feel like we either got to a point we knew we'd win or we got to a point we'd knew we lose, but getting the official answer still took another hour. And it was rarely close - either we sealed the heck out of gates or would get totally murdered. Both extremes still take a long time to finalize.

I can appreciate the effort that went into this game and its expansions but ultimately it is not a satisfying experience. And that's a pity given the investment.

Too much dice rolling and resources management take away much of the excitement and the players ultimately lose a sense of purpose.

Nice game, that I would love to love.
Somehow the gameplay reminded me of a complex Talisman (a game I don't like). I was running around, throwing dice and playing cards without strategy and some kind of storyline.

Not the same kind of games, but when in that kind of mood, I would prefere Mansion of Madness or Descent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My experience:

4 games played - 2 players, each player controlling 2 investigators.

I think this game is fantastic.

I like: 
- The game produces a story. The encounters are very RPG-like. Skill checks, combat, choices, objects, magic items, spells, it is all there. 

- The rules are complex but less complex than almost any traditional RPG. The complexity pays off because it gives you many options each turn.

- 3 different ways to victory, a variety of characters and of GOO's add to replayability.

I don't like:
- The new player has to invest a fair amount of time to understand and start playing the game unless there is somebody else to teach the it.

No other complaints.

I really like this game. I have played multiple times each solo and two players, but each was a blast. The theme is great for me as I am not a huge fan of the genre. 
Tense and fun, some call this a dice fest, but I disagree. Plenty of options each turn keep this fun. I have recently updated my score to 9 after two solo games and multi-player games. Any game that works well as a solo game and can be played with other players is a big plus for me. 
The only downside is the playing time which can run 4 hours, but if you can leave it out and come back to it there is no problem. 
It now has many expansion to enjoy your fun even more.

As many already know, this game can go really long, but it's the only game that I'd be willing to put the time into play after play.

This was a long time wish list item for me but slightly disappointed once I'd played it. By no stretch of the imagination is it a 10. Enjoyed but took a long time to play relative to the amount of play depth. A lot of pottering about. I'm not that great a fan of the 'get stuff - big bad coming' style game although this one is probably the best of that ilk. With a cleaner approach to certain tasks in the game (such as visiting the realms) 20% of the time required to play could have been shaved without sacrificing any of the flavour. Have only played a couple of times so rating may be subject to change.

Literally the only thing that I don't like about this game is that it takes about 4 hours to play. It is a game you need to plan your evening around, and that you don't just play on a whim.

gets easier with more investigators, despite the game's attempt to balance it.  Players who are at well coordinated and aren't especially unlucky will win without much trouble.  Thus, it just doesn't feel like a lovecraft story, and has all the wrong tempo for a horror story in general (since it gets easier as the game goes on and the most tension is early in the game).  I hear that expansions help a great deal with all those issues.

A lot of dice rolling, but a heavy theme appealing to Cthulhu mythos fans. Being one myself I really enjoy this game, however it isn't balanced well for large groups, I think 3 or 4 people tops. Unfortunately the greatest weakness of the game is in its "climatic" end. If a Great Old One awakens an ugly dice-fest awaits, so you should play to prevent this ultimate madness draining the players themselves.

Quickly became one of my favorites after a couple of plays. Such a rush having those close calls to save the world from the demise of the Ancient One awakening. Highly recommended, once the main game gets too easy add an expansion or two in to increase the challenge!

I have a love-hate relationship with co-ops. Most co-ops look gorgeous and are great on theming, you really get into the story. However, I'm quite competitive and I want to directly or indirectly assault my opponents, which pretty much rules out any co-ops. Exception voor Arkhsm Horror though. I love Lovecraftian stories and this game works really well!

I'm a big Lovecraft fan, so that raises the rating for this game in my eyes. It's fun enough, but it's got WAY too many fiddly bits and rules exceptions.  It would have been MUCH better designed as a paragraph game, since that's all it really is. Probably would have dropped the cost by 30% as well.

RATING: 5
I played the original edition back in the 90s.  Then 2008-01-05 I played a 5-player game of this new edition, with some expansions, and it took us almost 6 hours of collecting spell/weapon/skill cards and having wildly random encounters and cooperating to kill monsters and close enough gates.

The long play time was partly caused by 2 players selling their gate trophies instead of keeping them, but still, the game went way too long, and it got repetitive and frustrating.

The old me would have enjoyed that long slog more than the new me.  It's a good game if you're into this sort of boardgame roleplaying adventure.  It has some neat mechanics, and it's fun seeing the large amount of special cards.  But I don't seem to be into this kind of game very much any more.  My time is too short.

The components are quite well-done with some beautiful art, and some of the flavor text is nice.  (Some of it is silly, e.g. the "Twin Peaks" cherry pie reference in a diner encounter.)

Beware it is VERY text-dependent, if you play with non-native-English speakers.

Arkham reminds me very much of the eighties: very enjoyable when experienced in its proper context. It's flawed and random, but it's a very fun coop vehicle for light storytelling within a good group. I have no problem with the tons of setup concept when it leads to a good experience. And if you're lucky enough to have a great game runner, as we do, it's a blast.

Not sure what to make of this game. The game simply beats you up for as long as you are willing to play it. Enjoyable in a weird sort of way, like a horror-themed dominatrix. In my experience, the game play has been long (usually four to six hours) and there are a lot of rules to follow. However, the components and theme are top notch and extremely well done. The quality of the game is what keeps me coming back for more. 

You need to be familiar with at least a few of H.P. Lovecraft's short stories before you play or the theme will be lost on you.

As far as expansions go, they say not to include more than one at a time or else they will dilute each other and you won't get a taste of their true flavor. Looking forward to trying them all but this will take some time to accomplish.

It's a special occasion when we have a chance to enjoy AH because it does require a time commitment. We've tried Eldritch Horror but prefer AH. There's something about the intimate atmosphere of the Arkham streets, and mounting tension of desperately attempting to close the gates while alien creatures try to block you every step of the way that Eldritch Horror lacks. We also like the fiddly rules in AH, which aren't really difficult at all after a few turns. Just download and follow one of the excellent flowcharts on the BBG site, and after a few turns everything falls into place.

RATING: 4
I think this one of those boardgames where you can just teach everyone the rules and plan.  You need a GM who is expert on the rules and can really sell the theme, like one would in a RPG, to the players progressing through the game. Without that, the game just really flopped for us. More streamlined co-ops like Pandemic are just a lot more fun to play. The constant skill checks just get so boring and tedious, and the game can easily stagnate where you're not making any significant negative or positive progress for a long, long time.  I really felt I was lost in time and space metaphorically during the 2 games I played. I'm willing to try it again if I'm in the mood and have an expert that can basically GM it.

One of the finest and most complicated games I own and still love to play.  Only thing that dings it's score is the setup time, and the learning curve for getting new players up to speed.

RATING: 7
I feel like I can't play enough of this game. I'll punish myself and stay up way too late just to get in a game of AH. There's something rewarding and satisfying about getting your butt handed to you by this game. I love having terribly unsuccessful rolls all game long almost as much as I love those times when we put the game to bed. Nothing beats tommygunnin' hordes of monsters and racking up the trophies. This is a real epic game, and I love the details, the fiddliness, the theme, and the execution. I'm excited to acquire and play the expansions.

Update: I've had an abrupt change of opinion. Maybe I've played the base game to much, but the game feels too predictable. Recently, it feels like either I know I'm going to win after a long, slow process, or I know I'm going to lose roughly "X" number of turns from now and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I get really frustrated with poor die rolls, especially in the beginning when it feels like I'm getting a handicapped start. These are new feelings for me regarding this game. I feel very bummed, since I've had so much fun with this. The epic narrative that has me caring for my investigators has given way to frustration with fiddliness and bad luck.

Update: Dunwich Horror has rejuvenated my interest in this game. See below.

Im a fan of Cthulhu, so this is an easy game to like for me.  I think it can be a bit long if your group composition includes some AP problems, but over all this is a nice co-op game.  My one complaint would be that the game is hard to customize to the Elder you are fighting...   THat, to me, is what makes so much of the Cthulhu stuff our there so great...  you get a definate feel of a couple of different types of horror...   here in the game, you basically play the same game you would normally, and just fight a different monster at the end...   et up for the final battle is different sure, but they made the game epic enough, what's one more set of rules?

On the first play we died horribly - it was over in 40 minutes.  The second play took close to three hours, and while the first two hours were tense, by the end we won almost too easily - people were doing goofy things (let's all visit the carnival in Dunwich, I've never been there before), just because they had the leeway to do it.  I liked that you can't predict how it's going to turn out and that each play had a very different feel.  It was a truly immersive game.

Tried to play once solo to get a feel for it. Definitely not my type of game in that it is incredibly random and clunky.

Still, I could be convinced to play again. I would never play it solo again, but with a group of the right people, this could be an enjoyable experience. This could fuel a fun evening. It is random, but the way it is used means that every game will be different and could create some tense or even even hilarious moments that the creators of the game probably never even foresaw specifically.

The clunkiness of the rules would probably lessen after playing enough times to be familiar with them. 

In short, would try again in a group if asked, but not a game I would seek out.

What can I say about this game? Epic battles between a few heroic citizens and the vast host of evil gathering as the Ancient Ones attempt to re-enter the world makes for one heck of a fun time. 

Rules can cause an astonishing amount of debate, which is probably the only negative I have about the game as a whole. Everyone I know enjoys playing it, everyone I know enjoy the stories that are made up on the spot to account for the strange happenings befalling everyone.

The length can be off-putting to some; but it's a hot property in my gaming group.

A novel-based Role-playing game, a very good introduction to the Cthulhu mytho system. AH is never strategic: once you know the event cards, with a little bit of luck, you can waltz over the Other World and screw Cthulhu single handedly... So, really, this game is about experiencing other than managing. You play your role, you read the card text, and you pretend you were there, in that horrible town. Don't think of anything like 'I should definitely go to the newspaper as I have a 4/7 change to get a retainer'. It spoils the story.

Gateway into Cthulhu mythos; learning curve of at least 2 games and a long play time, which sometimes gets in the way of life and leads to hours of Arkham caused procrastination. 

Other than that, really awesome co-op game with great theme, gameplay, components, and replay value. All the expansions are amazing, challenging and fun. The one downside for Arkham is the downtime in games with over 5 players. If you have really chatty friends, planning can take forever and a year.

Seems very laborious, though colorful.  Pretty damned hard to win, too.  Tons of crap happening--it seems key to abandon the typical approach to personal victory and act as a team, or the game will spank everyone mercilessly.  The end tends to be too difficult and the outcome too evident before it arrives.  Also, this game, at least in its initial release, was plagued by severe quality problems.  My game had extra and missing cards, and a warped board.  Bad, bad, FFG.  Very enticing design, grapchis, and mechanics, however.  I need to play this more to refine my review.

Darn good Ameritrash. The mechanics are a bear to learn, but, once you have them down, adding the expansions becomes quite easy. Furthermore, if you have an experienced player, the rules can be introduced piecemeal, making the game easy to introduce. The base game with four or more players is easy, but if you remove some of the Elder Signs from the Unique Items deck, it should become more difficult. Or purchase the Dunwich Horror expansion set -- it adds thematic Insanity and Injury cards, and has an additional board to make 4+ play much more challenging.

****

The base game is 85% of the difficulty in the entire game series. At least play with the Injury and Madness cards. If you have 5+ players, play with the Dunwich board, though not necessarily with the Dunwich small cards.

The hardest part of the game will be the monsters. I *highly* suggest setting up the game ahead of time and playing a few turns yourself, and get the BGG player aid files with the flowcharts. When you play by yourself, fight monsters to learn the mechanics.

****

To save space on the board: 
* All the Encounter decks can be put into one deck. Just fan out the cards and pick one from your neighborhood.
* Put the smaller decks near locations that often use them. eg. Unique Items on the Curiousitte Shoppe location.
* Separate some space between an expansion board and the main board to put stuff in.
* Use "caches". When a player loses Stamina, Sanity, Money, etc. place the tokens on the board at the Hospital, Asylum, and Bank, rather than returning them to the storage bag.
* The AO sheet is the "cache" for Doom Tokens, Clues, and anything returned to the box.
* Use a small dice tray. A 100 card count plastic box works fine.

Other setup:

* Have the n00bs do as much setup as they can. Usually, this means anything with the tokens. Anyone who comes late plays a random character, setup before they arrive. While playing, I use the Bank, Asylum, and Hospital as caches to hold tokens. The BGG files also has a character sheet that avoids tokens, but it's too big for tables I play on. I also don't use dice because they roll.

* The Ancient One sheet is a cache for the Clue tokens and "return to the box" cards.

* Only play with one expansion set at a time, subject to Miskatonic. 

* Shuffle expansion and base decks separately, and place them next to each other on the board. Players draw the first card from the expansion set deck. Alternate drawing from the base and expansion Mythos decks, and don't even use the base Mythos deck with a small expansion (unless it's KiY). Use the expansion Encounter or Gate decks, instead of the base set.

***

I usually play with a single expansion, so don't mind keeping components in separate boxes -- just grab the base set and another box, and I'm good to go!

AH base game:
* All AOs which have no special components
* All Investigators with no cards from expansions
* All monsters except aquatic
* Injury and Madness cards (Dunwich)
* Final Battle cards (Kingsport)
* Personal Stories (Innsmouth)

Dunwich
* Investigators who start with cards from Dunwich set
* AOs with special components
* Curse of Dark Pharoah expansion set

Kingsport
* Investigators who start with cards from Kingsport set
* King in Yellow expansion set

Innsmouth
* Aquatic monsters
* Goat in the Woods expansion set

...if I get more frickin' monsters, I'm going to separate the hexagonal ones to the Goat in the Woods set for the Herald's cup!

***

Dunwich: Adds the much-lauded Injury and Madness cards. Also extends the playing area with a smaller board, pretty much necessary when you have more than four players.

Kingsport: Adds the Ancient One cards. Makes the Final Battle more unpredictable. The rest of the expansion is kinda less "exciting" (ie. deadly) since the additional board are stable locations. PM me if you want some custom heralds which add unstable locations to Kingsport.

Innsmouth: No "vital" cards, but makes the game much more dangerous. The Personal Stories add depth to the characters. I *think* Innsmouth has enough Innsmouth-related monsters for you to have a separate monster cup just of Innmouth monsters!

****

For your first game:

* Play a few turns solo. 
* Get the FAQ and reference sheets.
* Ancient One: Azathoth.
* Select investigators without a "3" stat. 
* Monsters appear on the board but don't do anything on the first turn. 

***

Feel free to use the DH board. With 4+ players, adding more real estate makes the game more of a challenge, and you will be there to "moderate" the game, anyway.

My house rule I use for n00bs is that they may place the slider anytime during the turn. Since they're new to the game, they'll have no idea where to put the slider during the first upkeep.

Also, explain how combat works only when the players have grasped the non-monster rules. Remember that the number of dice you will need *at least* is "3x the monster toughness plus the combat modifier". Investigators should have at least $2 cash on them for the Asylum and Hospital! 

*****

In the base box, I added stuff from some of the other expansions:
* Dunwich Horror: Injury and Madness cards
* Kingsport Horror: Ancient One Final Battle cards
* Innsmouth Look: Personal Stories
* Call of Cthlulhu LCG "Bag-o-Cthulhu" large and small tokens for the First Player and Terror Track tokens.
...plus various investigators, Ancient Ones, and monsters.

I threw out the insert and the box uses:
* Four 100-count Ultrapro deck boxes. They also fit the small cards.
* One large drawstring bag for the monsters
* One large ziploc bag for the investigators
* Several snack-sized ziploc bags for the other tokens.

Each big box expansion has enough space to put a small box expansion inside the well of the insert.

*****

Just some house rules I like to use... :goo:

1. For theme, separate out the aquatic monsters and put them in an Innsmouth cup. Since they're orange-bordered, they're easy to sort out. If any get in the monster cup, no big deal. I've also sorted out the Shub Niggurath monsters as the Black Goat hex cup. The Mask monsters are put into a deck. The first monster on the board is a Mask monster. The first monster in a gate surge is a Mask monster. For Dunwich, the first monster on the Whately gates (left side of board) is Old Man Whately, and the first monster at the Gardner's farm is a Colour Out of Space.

2. To reduce setup and teardown, draw regular-sized cards from the expansion cards first, and place the small cards from the expansion set next to the base game cards. This usually makes the game harder. For smaller cards, experienced players draw their first and third card from the expansion set cards first. Encounter cards are discarded, not reshuffled. When I run out of Encounter cards, I replace them all with those of the base set.

3. With all the Gate cards, you can make a separate deck for each Other World. In practice, for an Other World encounter, I draw a Gate Card, and, if it doesn't match the Other World, place it face down on one of the Other Worlds listed on the card, preferably the one with the fewest face-down Gate cards.

*****

Rather than shuffling the decks (and sorting them out after play)

* Small Decks: Put the base game and expansion small decks side-by-side on the game board. First card drawn is from the expansion deck. Newbies draw from the base game deck.

* Mythos Deck: Put the base game and expansion Mythos decks side-by-side off the game board. Alternate drawing from these decks.

* Encounter and Gate Deck: Draw from the expansion set deck first and discard (even for Encounters). When the deck or an Encounter location is exhausted, replace the deck with the base game deck.

Play the Injury and Madness cards (as well as Innsmouth's Personal Stories) with *every* game. Same with the monsters, Investigators and Ancient Ones. But, otherwise, there's no need to play the expansions together unless you have Miskatonic. No, don't sort out the monsters from the cup.

I feel like this game rides on the theme. I love the Mythos as much as anyone (Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn, and all that), but Arkham Horror's mechanics are so fiddly and mathematical (and I don't usually mind fiddly and mathematical) that I lose the mood, as it were. It's super long, and every time I play it, it feels like all my running around is ultimately redundant. We usually end up prematurely waking up Ye Old Grand Un, and cheating until it's dead. Then we all cheer. I can appreciate why people love this game (and I don't have any of the expansions), but the giant Lovecraftian conglomeration of systems and theme just doesn't come together for me. Playing it feels like work, more often then not.

I was only very vaguely familiar with the setting--everyone knows about Cthulu, right?

The game (vs. Yig) also took 5.5 hours!  My brain was completely fried.

There's so much going on (Yellow paths, black paths, moves like: "Monsters with triangles, slashes, and stars, or moons move," that one wonders why exactly there need to be quite so many combinations of possible moves.  I guess it is a game balancing thing but it was just annoying to have to check every monster for what symbol, every single turn.  There were a lot of things that just slowed rounds down incredibly.

I do appreciate that this game is co-op, and enjoyed that element.  For that reason I'd play it again with the caveat that it needed to be a monster who could be defeated relatively quickly, or at least quicker than *that* game.

Quite a game.  Great looking board, lots of cards and tokens and overall a really good production (minis for the characters might have been nice...similar to those for Betrayal at House on the Hill.)  I have always liked Lovecraft's work and the Cthulu mythos and seeing a lot of that brought to life was really cool.  I particularly liked the allies, especially Pitmann.  That's an excellent story and I like how his effect is incorporated by negating physical immunity of monsters.

The game is long but I dind't find it to be overly long.  Its also a bit arbitrary.  One person runs into a monster, the next person finds a load of clue tokens.  But such is life in the world of Arkham.  This isn't a game I would play all the time but a couple of times a year, sure.

There are a lot of things to like about Arkham Horror, like how it manages to create a fun pulpy paragraph game with lots of detail and thematic richness. The downside is that most of that richness must be avoided if the players want to have any chance at winning. The expansions only amplify the problem, filling it with little details that can never be explored if you want to have a shot at victory. It's also way more complex than it needs to be. Over twenty games and I still need to have a flow-chart in hand when I play. There's a lot to like, and it's such an important game from the last decade. Still, it's more of a museum piece for me now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Despite its reputation as a long and arduous heavy co-op game, this was one of my earlier board game purchases, and I have overall not been disappointed.  The myriad tiny cards and decent-quality tokens in this game come together to give you an experience that, despite that this game's production quality isn't on the level of a "premium edition" game, makes the game night feel like a special event.

This was also my first experience in the Lovecraftian theme in games, so there was some additional mystique there for me that I suppose would not exist for those already familiar (or bored) with it, but I think the game captures the feeling of cosmic dread quite well.  I have long sought a game which creates a compelling narrative that is different each time you play, and while I don't think this game completely achieves that - inevitably at some point you'll encounter events that seem incongruous with the overarching situation - I think it does so as well as any game I've played so far.

It's necessary to acknowledge that this game is carried largely by its theme and the way the mechanics embrace the idea of ever-present mortality, and the helplessness of mere humans.  You may find yourself against absurdly insurmountable odds at some times, and that is meant to be part of the fun.  If you don't tend to get engrossed in atmosphere and theme and/or don't accept that luck-based events with potentially dire consequences have a place in games, there is little reason for you to play this.

I just got a used copy of the base game of this...I've played a few games before, but some of them have seemed like so much effort for such a random game.  In subsequent games, I've warmed up to it some, but I still feel the same way about it somewhat.  Perhaps owning it and getting it to the table more for my gaming group will give it some life for me.

A great cooperative game -- but I think you must be in the mood for the ambience and setting of the game, rather than the mechanics of winning. The sense of desperation as the bid bad comes nearer to arriving is great. A game where you can really enjoy going insane and the end of the world.

RATING: 3.5
The disparate elements of Arkham Horror fail to come together in any fun or meaningful way. The goals, theme, and components all work to create a dark and interesting atmosphere that is easy to get invested in. This is undermined, however, by a complex mess of rules and text-based systems that slow the game down and are often overly-vague. What's more, there seems to be a number of items and sub-goals (I am thinking primarily of certain shops and encounters) that are totally irrelevant and unhelpful in the resolution of the game. Were these more than random items with modifiers and checks and perks that mean less and less the more you've collected, they might be fun to pursue. As it is, there just seems to be too little to do that is of any consequence and too much to keep track of. While the game has an end goal, your actions rarely seem to be driving toward it and instead feel like pointless tangents.

Given I'm a Cthulhu fan through and through, and I really like co-operation in games: it's probably no surprise I really enjoy this game.

RATING: 8
[Note: I have not played any of the newer Lovecraft games Elder sign, Mansions of Madness, or Eldritch Horror. My opinion of AH is not influenced by them.]

Visual Appeal: (5)
I love Fantasy Flight game art. The board is super easy to read and isn't obscured by the art. Each monster, Great One and character has a lot of personality.

Components: (4)
Nice thick cardboard chips. Needs some organization system not included in the box. I use small bowls. I am not a fan of mini-cards, but I can appreciate the space saved by using them here. The only other thing I don't like are the sliders to mark player stats. On a busy table they inevitably get jostled. If the sliders were built into the card or on a dial I would prefer. The cards and chips are up to the FFG standard of high quality.

Theme: (5)
This is the kind of game where people start to get seriously stressed out if things aren't going well. If 2D printouts of monsters have that effect, then something is going well with the theme. Some monsters are so threatening that there's just no way to overcome them. And that's a good thing, because hiding is just as exciting! The characters aren't superheroes, and you become invested in their sanity.

Learning: (2)
It takes quite a while to teach this game and teaching plus a full play through is exhausting. The rule book is concise as it can be with good examples, so I would recommend some pre-reading if I have serious new players coming to a planned game. Returning to the rule book mid-game feels inevitable since I don't get it to the table often enough to remember everything.

Gameplay: (4)
This is a co-op game where all players are moving around in different locations. Like Pandemic, you could huddle together for safety, but you'll need to spread your assets uncomfortably thin to have a chance at victory. Unlike Pandemic, if you fail you could go insane or be torn limb from limb by extra-dimensional horrors. Whereas Pandemic has an overall sense of impending doom, Arkham Horror makes it much more personal through tense dice rolling encounters. 

Overall Fun: (4)
This game is great when we have the time to play it. I usually have 3 players and our running joke is to ask "who wants a quick game of Arkham?" Every time we've played has been an all night affair, but it always feels like time well spent.

Arkham Horror really deserves a full review, but I'll be brief here. I originally rated this game a 6. Over 30+ plays this has crept up slowly to a 9. It is fiddly, long, and over-wraught. But there is still some real strategy to the game, and most importantly a wonderful experience to play, either by yourself or with a small group of like-minded friends.

I love this game.  It stays fun with many different numbers of players, including just two (a big advantage for when my wife and I want to play a game by ourselves).  I'm a huge fan of Lovecraft, and the whole thing just drips with Lovecraftian atmosphere.  And of course, this game is the king of co-ops - if you're looking for THE definitive thematic cooperative experience, in my book you don't have to look any further than Arkham Horror.

RATING: 9
This is a cooperative horror game set in the world of H.P. Lovecraft's mythos.  Players take on the role of investigators who must race to close and seal dimensional gates before a Great Old One rises and likely kills or renders insane the party, while also fending off "lesser" monsters who wander the streets of Arkham.  It can be played as a lite role playing game or as a strategy game with some role playing elements.

There is great tension as the players are usually outnumbered and rather doomed, which is fitting with the setting.  Each player's character is unique, and each round players may adjust their stats which allows for some wonderful tactical moments.

The game is long but worth the time, especially if you play up the role of your character, which will give rise to a good story.

Yet to play. Want to like this, although I am dubious about 'flavour text' in games - if I want to enjoy bad writing I'll read Lovecraft, who does it best. 

After 1 play : Ok, the rule book deserves all the criticism, but this is no Magic Realm. Gameplay is reasonably smooth, and I have to say, so far, I am really liking it. Plus the wife actually enjoyed it a lot more than our previous co-op experience (Lord of the Rings and Pandemic), in spite of the fact that it took us nearly 4 hours to play.

Flavour text seems snappier than in Runebound, the theme is wonderfully worked. Shame about the Ghoul illustration (which is even accompanied by a description of the 'canine' features) - that ain't no Lovecraftian Ghoul, I must mewl.

Considerably exceeded expectations.

2015 edit:I eventually sold all my Arkham stuff - it never got played, and took up too much space. I bought Elder Signs as a replacement. Something about the comparative size and simplicity appealed to me. If space and money weren't an issue, though, Arkham might have stayed.

The game sessions of [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987]Arkham Horror[/url][/i] can be enjoyable, nevertheless there is luck everywhere and many defects in the game itself.  So, this is not a game for everyone, and yes, it is better if you like Lovecraft's books.  But even when you haven't heard anything about them, the game experience may be quite good, if played with the right people.  I only have played once and I had a very good time.  I don't remember when was the last time that I laughed so much.  I guess that proves that it fails to create an horror environment, but who cares as long as the game session is a success.  The lenght of the game makes it one not to play very often.

If you have a couple hours to play, I think this game can suppress any need to play a roleplaying game. I no longer have time for RPGs, because they require a good 4-6 hour chunk of time and you have to play them on a regular basis in order for them to pay off.  Since I don't have the time, and gaming nights are hard enough to organize, I've moved completely over to the boardgaming side.  But, if I ever do have an RPG itch, I'll play this game. It's good fun, there's a lot in it, and you get to smack some monsters around.  I approve.

Very fun game! The theme and cooperative mechanic works very well here. I like the modern setting. Don't let the title scare you too much.

RATING: 8.5
Overly complex, with too many rules and a lot of unclear or ambiguous wording.  Takes too long.  Takes up too much room.  Requires expansions or house rules to fix the game once you understand the basic winning strategy.  And...

...I love this game despite all its apparent flaws!  Once I got into it I played virtually nothing else for several months, and bought most of the expansions within that time.

I highly recommend it for solo play as long as you have plenty of time and space available - or, like me, you have somewhere you can leave it set up somewhere safe from pets and small children!  While it's certainly rich with theme, you don't need to immerse yourself in the story, RPG-style, to enjoy it - there's plenty going on mechanics-wise if gameplay is your primary concern (as it is for me).

To me, this game has it all. It's tense, entertaining, fulfilling and fun. It however, comes with a burden: Takes very long to finish and very very long to setup. Still, a great game!

RATING: 5
Very much in the Runebound school of run-around-and-collect-stuff-to-beat-the-big-baddies game.  Well-flavoured and a little more engaging than RB, but ultimately somewhat flat if you aren't a Mythos fan (... that would be me, sorry.)

RATING: 3
Tedious. 

Encourages groups to set up 2-3 characters to run rampant across the board, killing monsters and doing whatever needs doing. If you are not one of those characters you will spend much of your time cowering in corners because it doesn't make sense to fight the monsters. I've never managed to accomplish anything significant in Arkham Horror, and I've never lost. 

Takes too long, is too random, and is disconnected from the theme. You have little control over the encounter you draw, and so you don't know what stats you will need. If you are loaded up with items and spells, then you should be fine. Otherwise you have too few meaningful choices about the game, and probably won't accomplish anything.

I do enjoy this, and all the variation and chaos. But I find this drags after a while. It's OK to play as a single player in an evening as well as a small group. I can't imagine what an 8 player game would be like, as there would be loads of waiting for your turn.

There just isn't any substitute for Arkham. The game is highly thematic, varied, tense, immersive, and enjoyable. You can play it with a wide range of player numbers, but I think the most important thing for me is that you can play it alone. Arkham is a wonderful solitaire experience. It isn't the shortest game to play, nor is it the easiest to learn, but I think its worth both the time and energy to do so. I couldn't imagine not having it in my collection.

RATING: 10
I have to give Arkham Horror props simply for being an incredible co-op experience. This is one of those rare games where everyone's working together towards a common cause, and it's an amazing accomplishment to actually WIN. 

My gripes about Arkham Horror would normally be pretty major (too many pieces, length of play, complex rules), but once the game gets going, it's so much FUN that it's really hard to dislike it.

I am less thrilled with the expansions, which are pretty much designed to make the game harder, more complicated and harder to set up. I'd rather just take the character cards out of the expansions and stick with the original game.

The gates spawn fast thane you can close it. The only possibility is to use seals or many Clues to close them permanently.  To get seals you have to dick the first 3 - 5 rounds in shops and hope to get one. That’s so boring and so broken I can’t recommend the game to anybody, if you can use Eldritch Horror as an alternative.

Although daunting at first glance with its tome of an instruction manual and easy to forget minutia within, all the games I've played of this have been both thematic and amusing.

Tras una partida, Arkham Horror no engaña a nadie, se acopla a todo aquello que había leído sobre él. Un juego largo, lento, pesado, no demasiado complicado de reglas, pero con muchos flecos y excepciones que hacen que la partida sea aún más lenta. No es un juego para todo el mundo, pero con la predisposición suficiente, creo que la experiencia puede ser muy buena.

En definitiva, un juego muy difícil de sacar a mesa.

RATING: 9
What can I say about Arkham Horror? Easily one of the best games I've ever played. It drips with theme, the components are great, you have a wealth of options/items/spells at your disposal.

Downside: downtime if you are playing with a large group. That and the fact that there usually isn't enough time to play another game!

UPDATE: 3/29/09 - downgrading from 10 to 9 simply because it takes too long to play nowadays.

I rather enjoy this, though I wish that the base game (sans house rules and expansions) were harder.  My group has yet to lose a game using the base rules (granted, there's only been a few games where we're not aware of any accidental cheating, so it's possible that some of our wins wouldn't have been).  Anyay, I find it quite good regardless.

RATING: 10
There are a lot of positive things I will say about this game but as with some of my other reviews I will be addressing points made by people who hate the game and rated it poorly. Let's see here:

"Brain-Dead Turns" | "My Decisions do not matter" | "Game plays itself"|

This seems to be a general theme. I guess if you really feel that way you are absolutely playing the game wrong without a shadow of doubt in my mind. EVERY decision is meaningful, and if you don't do something right GAME OVER. Yeah, it's that brutal. This game is probably one of the hardest cooperative games that is WINNABLE I've ever played. But don't listen to those negative reviews, every choice matters. Between killing monsters so your outskirts don't get piled up, to beefing yourself up to be able to face encounters to get clues and/or seal gates, to cooperative with your teammates it's all very important. A turn wasted in this game could very well mean the difference between an advantage, and a disadvantage.

"Dice Luck." | "Game is completely random."

Uhm. Yeah. That's the point, random encounters, mythos, to make it  so when you face the same Ancient One you're not following the same storyline. Wouldn't that be boring? This is a narrative game you know. Complaints about dice luck make me laugh. Go play a card game then. Stay away from board games. It's so easy to mitigate bad dice luck.

"Poor game Mechanics" | "Game is Totally unbalanced, you can stay at certain locations and not lose." 

What? The mechanics in this game are pretty damn rich, well detailed, and the game is truly balanced. I've had hard games where I've lost by a long shot, games where I've barely lost, games where I've barely won, and games that I won by a fair margin. I don't see ANY balance issues here, or any locations that are overpowered/broken. You're most likely playing the game wrong, which seems to be a common trend with Arkham Horror players from my experience.

"x and x games are better for cooperative feeling."

To a point, this can be true. If you're simple-minded. I think the suggestion was play Pandemic instead, which from my experience is a neat game. But that's it, just neat. It get's pretty boring pretty fast. Core game versus core game, Arkham Horror overshadows most Cooperative games by a towering shadow, and I'm sorry Pandemic doesn't hold a candle to Arkham Horror in "Cooperative Depth." Don't get me wrong, Pandemic (core) certainly has VERY strong cooperative play, but Arkham has stronger. In Pandemic you're all running around doing the SAME thing, trying to remove cubs and maybe trade cards, bounce special abilities to get someone to remove more cubes, move further, etc. In Arkham you have that AND about 50+ more problems. A monster is going to attack someone? Can they handle that fight? I'll lower my sneak so it comes after me instead, clearing monsters so people can get to locations, ALL THE DAMN MYTHOS CARDS THAT REQUIRE TEAMWORK TO FINISH, I can bless my teammates!? Please.

"The downtime between turns is so long, there's so much board maintenance!"

Maybe if you're not fluent in english and it's your first time playing the game I'll agree. Resolving a Mythos Card, moving monsters, and placing a gate, counting monsters for terror, etc. This should take less than 3-5 minutes unless you're talking about the effects of a Mythos and what your next gameplan is. Players should be thinking about what they are going to do not just this turn, but the turn in advance as well. Turns take about 1-5 minutes depending on your encounter. The only problem comes in when you have AP, or analysis paralysis.

-

Well there are a lot of negative reviews so I won't go through all of them. Point is this game is amazing, if you want something fresh and new in a cooperative feeling and you're not afraid of complexity I would definitely recommend this game.

I will agree this game can be long, and usually you have to explain a lot, but I've never had any problems and my games usually take 3-6 hours depending on how long my friends take to think of their turn. Which to a lot seems like a long time but it's worth it because you REALLY do feel like you just saved the world.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
It could be because I learned this game and played only once on a heavily modded copy + 3 expansions. Or maybe it hasn't aged well, especially next to Corey Koniezcka's recent efforts. Whatever it is, this was an outright disappointment. Basically a huge sense of "do random things and have random things happen to you" without a way to tie everything together, making it more a stitched-together mash-up of choose-your-adventure (like Tales of Arabian Nights) instead of true board game. Shit happens to you, you roll a die, and look up the result. Rinse and repeat.

Mansions of Madness has the same setting, and feels like a board game with meaningful choices. And Gears of War scratches the Ameritrash cooperative itch with interesting missions and tense action (heck, you can even seal "portals" -- emergence holes -- in that).

The only thing I like here is the Focus, to change your risk exposure to different situations. In fact, most proponents of AH argue that it is a game of risk-taking, but still, I fail to see how a cooperative game with perfect information can transcend little more than an overly long, shared RPG narrative experience and become a board game, let alone a good one.

1+1

I'm not too much for co-op games (unless playing by myself) but I enjoy Arkham most of the time and it's a favorite among several friends so it makes it to the table a decent amount. Also good for a large range in number of players, which is a bonus to the game for sure.

We like this game.  It is very fun and it does a pretty good job of establishing a Lovecraftian atmosphere.  I dislike the mapboard from an aesthetic perspective, but overall doesn't detract that much for me.  I have the card expansions but not the board ones.  Don't see a need for more boards in this game.  Maybe I'll see the light (or darkness of the eternal void of He who shall n ot be named) one of these days.

RATING: 7
Astonishing.

+ Beatiful
+ Cool theme
+ Some dice rolling
+ Cool system how monsters move
+ Only one player has to know the hardest rules (monsters movement for example)

- Too easy
- Slow
- Long to play, to setup and to put everything back
- After a while reading cards becomes a bit boring and you just want to know the effect
- After a while you know where cards are and you just aim for that
- Bacground of charachters is 100% useless
- In the end some time you are not scared at all because you know already you'll win and you just wait the game to slowly finish
- Sometime facing the big-boss will be something you aim, because it's easy to win

RATING: 7
Oh the pain.  The sweet, brutal, torturous pain.  Long set-up, 3 hours minimum to play, long breakdown to put away.  So WHY do I rate it a 9?  I love the theme.  Simple as that.  One of the few co-op games that I will suggest to play as it has a group element for overall planning, but you still get your OWN turn.  Cool items to pick up, monsters to fight, journeys to the "other" side, a potential fight against a Great Old One, and inevitably, defeat.  A fun, exciting, excellent ride into oblivion!

After playing Eldritch Horror, AH takes a serious step back.  I think that AH got way too big for itself and it collapsed under its own weight.  This went from a classic game that I would have held onto forever to something that I wouldn't mind seeing go.

What theme.  Like Talisman, but with a goal that forces the game to move fast (although still long).  With players who love theme, this one shines as a great coop, much better than pandemic/red november theme wise.  So much theme, you might just go insane from the sight of it!

RATING: 7
Very much an experience game.  Cooperative in the sense that everyone has a common goal.  However, unlike Lord of the Rings, there is plenty of opportunity for players to do their own thing.  In fact, much of our game, we were off doing our own thing, but still trying to meet the common goal.  I found this to be quite enjoyable and look forward to being able to play again.  One item of note, the game ended at the right time.  It was beginning to drag somewhat (at 2-1/2 hours with four people) and would have left a somewhat less pleasant impression had it gone on much longer.

Fun game, super-easy, rules are not too complicated, but can be very ambiguous, even with the 8 page FAQ from Fantasy Flight Games. 

Experienced Gamers should play 1-2 rounds (or even 1 game) solo, then invite their friends to play.  That, or learn from an experienced gamer.  

1st game will take 5+ hours, subsequent games will take 3-4 (depending on monster spawns and speed of play).

9 plays of this game (and I'm not sure how accurate that is) is like 20 hours of game. Long with lots of dice rolling and silliness. Also lots of story both in game and with the players.

Bad at strategy games? NO PROBLEM! This game has you covered. There is so much randomness to this game your choices will hardly affect the outcome anyways.

*Randomly draw a card to see what happens.
*Randomly draw monsters.
*Roll dice.
*Repeat.

RATING: 6
Prior to 2011, I only played AH solitaire.  

This game can be crazy fun.  The theme is blended in perfectly, and the tension is pretty constant for the entire game.  Many have criticized the pace (less difficult as you seal more gates) but the you can either add an expansion or use a couple house-rules to fix whatever you think needs fixing.  This game is easily modifiable, especially with the excellent Strange Aeons program. Rolling a 5 or 6 has never been so satisfying.

There are negatives, of course, and the fiddly-ness (both in terms of components and rules) has to be at the top of the list.  Nowadays, I don't bring this out very often because if I have an hour or two to play something, I don't want to spend most of that time setting something up.   Best played in the middle of summer, during vacation, over the course of 2 days.

Update (Feb, 2011):  finally played this 2-player and it was great fun.  

Update (2014):  I'm down-grading this to a 6 now that I own Eldritch Horror.  I'll probably keep AH in my collection, but it doesn't have the same draw anymore.  When would I pull out AH over EH?  Not sure, not sure.

A bloated game with a terrible rules booklet (need FAQ to start). There are too many components and too many little rules for what is essentially a simple game; and it takes too long. On the plus side it has theme as the Lovecraft styled text on the cards is very good. A disappointment.

Really a lot of fun once you get up to speed, but this one takes a good chunk of time to complete. I'm not entirely sure we played all the rules correctly and there is certainly a steep learning curve to Arkham, even for those familiar with other horror titles like Mansions of Madness. You may recognize some of the characters, but game play is drastically different. The game components are superb though I wish the characters & monsters were miniatures instead of tiles.

Yay. A board game for RPGamers.  Or what to do if you haven't time to DM and go into character building (yay for interesting pre-set characters with backstories). I really like the system (RPG wise). And this is what it is: a great RPG substitute with great atmosphere - if players immerse themselves in it. If that's not what you're after, don't even bother with this game. Furthermore each game can have a different atmosphere - one is romantic gothic disaster, the other noir detective film, and so forth. 

Prerequisite for playing the game is that somebody knows rules by heart (check player aids) - then people can immerse in the characters and the game also becomes newbie friendly (weight bellow 2.5 for them). Obligatory loud reading of encounters.

I had played this with friends when it first came out, but I never really bought it.

It does take a while to set up, but I feel that the theme and gameplay this can provide makes up for that.

There is a bit too much downtime in this game for me. While very thematic and pretty well done mechanics wise, the game is long... but too long. I don't mind a longer game, but this one drags on due to the player rolls and turns and everything associated with that. 

Gameplay slows to a crawl later on and you find yourself thinking that people should speed it up a little. I hate feeling that way about my fellow gamers, so to me this game definitely did not live up to the hype that I've read about it.

The game is best with 4 players. If you go for a large group (6 or 7) then you will find yourself dozing off inbetween turns.

Update: I've played this with 2 players recently and it flowed a lot better. The game still does not live up to the hype in my opinion, but it's much more fun with fewer people. The turns go quick, you get to plan your moves easier, and it flows nicer.

Nice to see a collaborative Cthulhu board-game with such varied mechanics. There are a few potential exploits however, involving the scientist [I think] standing on the place a gate will form and denouncing it right away, so that you deal with the game at your own pace. Some nice combinations of characters and items can really pack a punch, but the monster overflow track can be a bit overwhelming at times.

Until all players are used to the turns, it can be real slow going at first.

This may be my new favorite game, after grabbing it at half-price at a Barnes and Noble clearance sale. Yes, there are a lot of rules (The Universal Head file on BGG will help out immensely) but once you get a handle on them, the game is incredibly immersive and enjoyable. Great art and characters, and an almost-RPG feel make this for an excellent group experience, so long as everyone is open to falling on their faces a few times. I also had a blast playing solo on my first go. I already can't wait to get it back on the table, even after playing twice within a week.

A fine revision of the original. Very evocative with some nice variability. Some of the systems are nicely cleaned up, though it still has some rough edges.

The whole shebang works as a system but doesn't provide much exceitement or tension. Players basically assume a character in the town of Arkham and attempt to close gates that are opening across town.

Along they way, they can upgrade their skills/equipment (in true FFG fashion) and battle/evade baddies.

It's overly long for the experience and ultimately it feels a little solitaire-ish race against the clock, albeit lacking in tension or hard decisions.

In any case, the board looks dull and unattractive and confusing compared to the 1st edition. The other bits are well constructed and although the art is recycled from the Cthululu CCG, it's excellent nonethless.

A truly excellent gaming experience. This game is basically a minature RPG, with the players working together against incredible odds. This makes it ideal for people who want to play an RPG in one sitting.

However, it can be exceedingly difficult and people who are unfamiliar with it or gaming in general may percive this as a serious flaw. After all, investing four hours into a game and having everyone playing it loose may be too much for some people...

This game has everything that I want from a game. Great theme, tons of replay value, action, adventure, weirdness, and an overall rpg-lite experience that is often more fun than actual role-playing games. The components are of excellent quality and the artwork is great. The basic set is a little too easy, but the expansions make the game very challenging. The game works great as either a cooperative group game or as a solitaire game, and is the best solitaire game I've ever played.

A rather thematic cooperative that lacks some of the tension of Battlestar Galactica-- the game that seems the most relevant comparison. I'm willing to play again, but I seem to be growing less interested in cooperative games as a whole. And this one felt slightly too long. Overall, an "OK" game.

The components are nice, and there are a lot of them. I suppose a must for Lovecraft fans. I'm not one of them and for me the game lasts a little too long and is also a bit tedious.

This game is bloated. It takes too freaking long to figure out and play. The characters aren't remotely balanced. Spells are almost universally terrible. The game gives players a plethora of options, but the "right" way to play is surprisingly narrow. Good premise for a game, though. I would be interested in trying out a remake of this game in the future.

This game is a lifestyle that will lead you to trying to sort out how to incorporate a much bigger table into your life. Be prepared for long games of 6 hours or more, and a bit of a commitment to reading the rulebook and the online comments about rules. I love the cooperative spirit of the game, which can lead to learning new playstyles from others.

English language version. Sleeved.
Good game. Rulebook is not very well-organized. Takes quite long, but that is probably the point. Good fun, but does not capture Lovecraftian horror too well, or so I believe (to much shooting, not enough of the more subtle horrors.)
It is excellent as a solo adventure game (usually playing2 investigators), if one plays it as an adventure game and not as a find-the-way-to-the-optimal-win game. With more players I find it too slow, unless everyone is very concentrated, knows the rules and does not snack nor chat. Very unlikely.

RATING: 7.5
Great game! Very involved and should draw in any Lovecraftian. In this game you and a group of friends must team up to stop an ancient elder god from coming into our world. You'll find clues, encounter monsters, find allies, and jump in and out of other worlds in order to close portals that have appeared in Arkham. 

The game is screaming with theme. Characters have great bits of backstory written up and almost every monster you encounter includes wonderful flavor text to describe their beastly form or terrify your mortal soul. The game can be punishing, which it should be considering you're trying to stop a god. This only makes victory taste all the more sweet when you manage to win. The rules are a bit heavy and can easily scare away newcomers to board games, so make sure you invite the right group of friends.

Arkham horror provides so much variation, you could play it for an eternity. You'll face different elder gods and encounters every play through making the game feel fresh every time.

The biggest blessing and curse to this game is the number of available expansions for it. Each expansion adds more encounters, items, spells, characters, gods, etc... And while these additions are wonderful, it can cause the game to feel bloated. AND if for some awful reason you decide to combine all of the expansions (like I did) you will find yourself tripping over all of the rules you must remember in order for the game to function properly. My greatest advice is to use one, maybe two, expansions at the same time, but no more.

There are some other rules in the game that can be improved upon with a few house rules. Many of these rules have already been improved upon by the game's newest incarnation, Eldritch Horror.

RATING: 7
I want to like this more, based purely on loving the mythos. The truth is, AH just doesn't deliver a satisfying gaming experience. The inevitable result of the game usually becomes clear by about midway, where if you have not yet closed/sealed enough gates there is no way you are going to win aside from by an insanely lucky set of dice rolls at the end, fighting the Great Old One.

I'd rather spend the the two hours playing till that point playing something else.

Super happy fun in a box. Uh, and incomprehensible horror.

After playing solo, with two, and some larger multiplayer games, I think the sweet spot for Arkham Horror (for me) is two-three players. Even after a larger group knows the game well, finishing a game can take 4 hours. You can easily cut that in half for a two player game, and for two players each playing only a single investigator, there is superb tension.

Arkham Horror is, for my money, the best table-top adventure game around. It's definitely "pulp Cthulhu" what with blasting your shotgun at dread Cthulhu himself, but it makes for a fun game. It takes a few plays to figure out the rules. I'll just warn you ahead of time that the rule book isn't the best. You *will* run into situations that are not covered in the rules, often. This will force you to look up errata online, as well as develop some house rules of your own. In the end, the process is worthwhile however, as a fun game emerges. Production values are top notch - it's a gorgeous game.

The best thing about Arkham Horror, for me, is that it got me interested in the Call of Cthulhu role playing game, which I am now Cthrazy about! I never figured I'd come back to pnp rpgs after a 20 year absence, but life is full of surprises. Update: I'm less interested in CoC RPG than I was - I've found I like games with more character development. CoC is a neat game though, and features some of the best game writing I've ever seen.

Of course, the game was just purchased and punched that day. As with my copy of Twilight Imperium, 3rd edition, the components are excellent, with all counters made of a heavy cardboard stock. Cards are solid, not flimsy. Very nice graphics. Overall I would give the components a 10. We played with seven players, all pretty much hardcore gamers. The owner of the game was the main rulesmaster. It seems he spent more time flipping pages than rolling dice. Hard to imagine in this game, eh? :) One other player was familiar with the original. The player to my left went first the entire game, which means I went last the entire game. We missed the rule about passing the "First Player" token to the left at the start of every turn until the last turn when I looked up the rule for myself. Yep, right there on page one. :) I commented at one point that we should all have a copy of the rules to save time in finding things. Most of the comments from the 2 rulesmaestros were about how bad the rules were written. After we got rolling, we seemed to beat the game pretty handily, whacking monsters and gates with ease. One player was down to 1 sanity. Doom track was at about 6. We never got the Terror track above 1. Of course, since I went last everyturn, everyone else beat me to all the monster/gate bashing b4 I could do anything. In that respect the game was boring. However, I never really felt any atmosphere to the game. Certainly, no "Horror". I mostly felt boredom and thought about how, after playing many games recently with other first time players, I will no longer be trusting that the rules are being interpreted properly. In my mind, there's nothing worse than playing a game, and then finding that you were playing it wrong. Waste of time. So, we all agreed to read the rules this week and play again next week. I guess I'm just not into the "horror" thing and definitely have never been into Lovecraft. But, as I stated, I didn't feel any atmosphere to the game, any excitement, any fear, nothing. I don't see how not moving last all game will change any of that, but I'm willing to give it another shot. If anything changes, I'll let you know.

Really nice game, unfortunately I've only played it with 5 players so far which made the game a tad bit too slow.

RATING: 8.5
One of the best "grown up" board games I have ever played. Theme, experience and component quality just blew me away. As a relative newcomer I have yet to delve into the expansions, but the prospect is certainly exciting (if a little daunting due to the time it takes to set-up and play just the standard edition).

Admittedly it *is* dice/luck heavy, which can put off more strategically-minded gamers, but if you are a fan of the Lovecraft Mythos then this is a game you should definitely give a try.

Edit: Slowly introducing the non-boardgamer friends to this one and so far it is going down a storm.

RATING: 8
Co-op games are hard to do. You need to make the game hard enough that it provides a challenge to the players, smart enough that every game doesn't feel the same and easy enough for the players to understand. Arkham Horror accells at these first two points but falls a little short at the third. The game is difficult, but not impossible, every monster, location and boss have a unique feel. But some of the game mechanics can be an absolute pain to explain to new players. No one mechanic is super complex, but it's a game with a lot of small medium complexity level parts and that can be a pain for new players. Once you get over this barrier though Arkham Horror is the most rewarding Co-Op board game I have played and the expansions will have you playing it forever.

Instead of exploiting the great possibilities of the theme for creating narratives and interesting player interaction, the game is your usual FF/Eagle games 'block buster' with heaps of bits and accessories that add nothing to what is essentially a tedious logistics management game. The unelegant gameplay bogs down to endless calculations of die roll modifiers and player interaction is very limitid in this so-called cooperative game. There is no plastic bits though, that's a bonus.

Gyönyörű kivitelezésű, összetett, jól kitalált játékmenettel rendelkező, nagyszerű kooperatív játék. Több győzelmi és elbukási lehetőség, végig izgalmas játék. A kockák szerepe jól eltalált, bár a dobások száma elrémítheti a kockafóbiásokat. De közel sem annyira durva a helyzet, mint pl. a WoW-ban. Kicsit rosszul kiegyensúlyozott játék a játékosok számának a függvényében (2-en nagyon nehéz, 3-an igazán jó. 4 és afölött talán könnyűnek mondható.).

Entertainment Value: 2 out of 4. Orginially when I bought it 4 out of 4. But as time went on I re-evaulated the "fun".  It gets boring.

The good: Componets are amazing.

The Bad: Although many boardgames are repetitive for some reason this one constantly reminds me how repetitive it is.

Bottom Line: If you like the mythos and HP lovecraft and you like complicated but interesting rules get it.

Not sure why I like this...I don't think the mechanics are that interesting, per se, and it probably leans way too much towards fighting for a Lovecraftian re-enactment. I suspect it's the dark aura of mystery the components exude, or something. All in all, it makes for an interesting and engaging cooperative story.

Edit: after years on the fence about this one, I got a really engaging solo game in (with 4 investigators), and had to raise my score. Regardless of its many flaws, very few games I played manage to re-create a sense of story and purpose as this one does.

A great game for 2-3 people and sometimes 4 if everyone knows what they are doing.

Excellent components, both durable and neatly illustrated. Challenging game experience, if a bit too hard especially for beginners and/or with few investigators. Hard to remember all of the many interacting rules, which are nicely but confusingly presented. Gameplay provides a lot of atmosphere, although there's no proper introduction to the myths of Cthulhu in the game.
Main advantage: Can be solo played!

Summary: Very good materials, average to good gameplay (depending on players' experience level), poor presentation of the rules.

I am trying so hard to like this game. 
Too hard.

UPDATE: Had another session with 3 players. I have now tried it out for 4 times and can't seem to be able to wrap my head around it. Main issues:
- Too fiddly. The exception of the exception of the rule written on page 28 without any logical reasoning sort of sucks the theme out. 
- Silly downtime, especially with annoying "delayed" moves or moving through the dimensions and only getting "nothing happens" cards
- Not too many cards on the locations (base game), too many of them with silly "nothing happens" or "lose 1 sanity, boo hoo" adventures. I understand that it's supposed to draw people towards expansions, but still annoying. 
- Half-themed. Do you really expect something to be dripping with theme when you publish it in Times New Roman? 
- Made too fiddly and difficult for a simple, almost blatantly naive game.

I always run with these houses rules:
1> If you lose all health or sanity you can not drop half your stuff, you must take an injury or madness card.
2> Monster surges are always just one monster per gate (2 in larger player count games). This prevents game stopping from early monster surges.
3> Each player gets 3 random characters and chooses one of them to play. Only 1st time players get to pick from the entire cast!

Yay!  It did not disappoint.  There is enough of the old game here that I was pleased that I don't have to go back and spend the bucks on it, but there is so much more in quality, quantity and elegance.  The only thing I liked a little better in the original game was that the monsters did more roaming, here they are a bit more static.  Still, I'm going to be playing this for years to come.  

Sure, it is a little heavy on dice and luck, but the level of fun is pretty friggin high.  Be prepared for a long game though, certainly by todays standards.  If you play this with 5 or less then the downtime should be significantly decreased.  I really wouldn't recommend playing it with more than 5.  

There is only one thing that I would change, when you get random cards to start with, you should be dealt one extra and discard one to tailor your character more toward your desires.  

When I am in the mood for a horror game, I think that for me this is the be all and end all (and I've played a number of them).  

UPDATE: I've gotten a number of games under my belt now and so far they have played out completely different every time.  I have found that this game plays best from 2-4, fine with 5, but don't bother with more, the downtime will hurt the experience.

Fun game for a group of people ... had played it a few times with friends before buying the entire set and have since played a few times with family.  Was a perfect game at the cottage where we were able to leave it setup and played over the course of a couple of days. Looking forward to trying the expansions !

Not a favorite. A bit too unwieldy and random for my tastes. I [I] much[/I] prefer the card game. The card game has buckets of decisions, where this one has buckets of dice. The card game's also a lot more focused and has a better narrative. 

I recently played a game (nearly 5 hours) where my character didn't really do much due to bad die roles and when I looked at her right before the boss fight, she was only marginally improved over what she started with. 

I will enjoy this only when played seldom with the just right group. As for the card game, I love to play that weekly, or even a couple times a week if I get a chance!

I love playing this game with my friends.  There's something about coop games that I really enjoy, even though I'm super competitive.  I love that feeling of urgency towards the end of the game, when players are pulling together to find the most optimal path to victory, making every turn count.

Also, the theme is very appealing to me, and I enjoy the aspect of having a character to develop.

RATING: N/A
Played once at GenCon, and found it all pretty pointless.  The game looks good and the teamwork aspect makes it socially fun, but Pandemic can be played with half the pieces and in half the time.  It struck me as a glorified version of Talisman without the fun of beating someone.  I would try it again though, to give it a full play, since we didn't actually finish our game.

I was wary of this game once again because of the negative comments on here.  I'm beginning to think it just comes down to if you like American games or Euro games.

I played this two player, with my cousin, with the Dunwich expansion, and we had an absolute blast.  What can beat a crazyman soldier with a flamethrower and his female psychologist partner packing a tommygun?  The answer: nothing.  That's not true - Shudde M'ell can kill them, but you get my point.

This game is very, very rich in theme, amazingly so, and very fiddly to the point where it starts to approach War of the Ring.  I love the atmosphere of Arkham, and the story that the game tells can be engrossing in its thrills, suspense and hilarity.

Not the sort of game I expected to like much, but I love Arkham Horror. There isn't much strategy, but it's the best boardgame I've ever played for sheer story value. Extremely immersive, stressful, and fun.

It really seems (from only a few plays) like it's more fun when role-played, and not so much treated like a boardgame with an optimal strategy. We will see...

Needed to take a break from this one after about a half-dozen plays. A great game, but I'm really kind of sick of teaching it.

I've only played one game solo (and I've realized I don't really like gaming by myself very much) and man, was it a chore. But one of those fun chores where you kind of get lost in it. I think this game would really shine with about three people, so one could take care of all of the end of turn fiddly stuff, one could remind everyone about upkeep at the beginning of the turn, and one could kind of keep track of the outskirts, sky, monsters on board, etc. 

Really, the game isn't that difficult, it's just that there is a lot to keep track of and there is so much going on. It's basically move, encounter, bad stuff happens. I now need someone who feels the same way about the game and can play in sessions.

This game is the de facto storytelling game—it plays out like a novel. You don't come to Arkham to win or lose, you come here to find out what happens to you and all your friends as you move about town trying to solve the mystery of the GOOs, slay monsters, get cursed, join cults, search old run-down shops for elder signs, or whatever else the wretched hand of fate chooses to deal you. You practically need a football stadium to lay out this game with all of the expansions, but it is well worth the investment of time. Each game has been fun, exciting, and the stories this game tells have always been epic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really neat game, I had fun playing it but was a bit disappointed with the big game-end monster battle. I'm a huge fan of Lovecraft's work and really get into playing this game for the nicely executed theme and feel. Obviously, you win the game by closing and sealing the required number of gates, but if you allow the Old One to awake, you pretty much lose. This is true to the books, but that crazy dicefest of a battle leaves something to be desired game-wise.

RATING: 10
Played 50+ times - always with the Dunwitch Horror expansion and mostly with many other expansions.

If you are interested in a highly immersive, thematic, cooperative board game that features a unique, unfolding story, this is it.

The game 'system' is so much more naturally integrated and evocative than those than in other cooperative games like Lord of the Rings and Shadows Over Camelot.

Hundreds of elements come into play and interact during a game. Each game plays out so differently that it's insane. One game, you may spend much of your time in the town shops, the next game they might as well not even exist. Crazy.

Our last game came down to one last roll to close the last gate before the ancient one awakened. 50-50 chance. We failed. Abhoth burst forth. In the final battle, Abhoth devoured three of us, leaving only the old soldier with one last attack with his flamethrower. He needed four successes on four die. Unbelievably, he got it. We cheered and cried and cheered some more. To me, moments like that are what gaming is all about.

Works beautifully with 2 players, each playing 2 investigators.  My SO and I can knock out a game of this in about 2.5 hours.  Playtime scales exponentially with # of players: would not play with 6 more, and strongly hesitant to play with 5 (especially if several of them were new.)

When the itch needs scratching, I drag out Arkham Horror.  I've got all the cool Litko products that pimp the game nicely like Gates and monster stands, as well as all the neat little painted miniatures that FFG produced.   I usually play solo with 3 or 4 Investigators.   I close the necessary gates, box it all back up and it's out of my system for at least another three months.

This game is excellent. Light RPG elements mixed with Cthulhu Mythos makes for a fun (if not long) evening. I like how the game is stacked against the players... it really gives the proper feeling of dread that accompanies any Lovecraft story. It didn't bother us one bit that we got wiped out (oops... Terror Level got to 10), we all had great fun playing. Complaints? The board is flimsy and prone to warping easily. The rules contain a lot of picky details (we had to refer back to the rulebook a ton of times and make a few game rulings that didn't seem to be answered, but at least the manual was well designed). All-in-all a great time though!

RATING: 10
RPG-lite. Arkham Horror inspired me to devour a "best of" Lovecraft's literature, so it's neat to come back to the game knowing the story behind the characters and locations. I had rated this game a 10 the first time around; it [i]is[/i] as amazing as everybody says. However, as I'm wrapping my head around how to "beat" it, I find myself less and less inclined to pull it out with people who've played it before.

Update: This rockets right back up to 10 when we're using a bunch of Launius' personal house rules to toughen things up.

Double Update: Well, well. Two years after my first "real" boardgame purchase and I own every single expansion* - go figure, it's an amazing line - and oh my dear sweet sleeping scourge of sanity you don't even need house rules to make it impossible anymore.

*For the record, that's Dunwich Horror, Innsmouth Horror, Kingsport Horror, The King in Yellow, The Black Goat of the Woods, the Lurker at the Threshold, and the Curse of the Dark Pharaoh. I'm tired of having a separate entry for each one.

RATING: 10
What can I say that hasn't been? Probably the deepest thematic game i've ever played. So much to do on every turn, so much to think about, endless variety - I swear this game ruins other thematic offerings for me sometimes because it put the bar so high. They say the rules are so impenetrable, but I never thought so - there are just quite a few moving parts you need to get used to. Long game, but keeps you interested.

Of course, the luck factor is very high, but you have to go into it knowing this already. 

Very very fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very engaging cooperative system with rich atmospherics and genuinely creepy theme.  I would play this anytime, as random character selection and the varied global effects of the Deep One du jour are huge replay pluses.  Plays great from 1 to 4 players, but drags too much at 5 or more, unless you have a particularly fun and patient group.  

Warnings:
Occasionally, there is the sense that the game plays you, but it's a necessary evil in a pure co-op game.  Daunting set-up -- requires a pretty large space.

Wish I had more hours in the day and would play this continuously. First brought me into table top gaming, but still love it. So much to do and think about it is so immersive. 

Even played it wrong for the first 20 or so plays (not recorded) without realising if you sealed six gates with elder signs you'd win - trying to seal 14 or so gates was pretty tough (yeah, impossible) so we only very occasionally won when fighting the GOO. Still loved every single game however. Still early days, but hard to imagine anything would replace this as my favourite game.

Yuk! I'm not really a Lovecraft fan, so that might be part of my dislike for the game, but it seems that the game is pretty much impossibly stacked against the players, and that really, as long as you can collect a bunch of good items and then fight the evil overload in a huge dicefest, you'll win. The decisions in this are totally uninteresting and the game is way too long and overly fiddly. I am stunned that the theme has buoyed this into the echelon of the top 100.

Effectively a Lovecraftian Mythos roleplaying game in a co-operative boardgame.  [And it's been around a lot longer than Pandemic etc ...].  Naturally the rules are quite detailed (as there is no Gamemaster), but the system of cards and counters with lots of info is ingenious.  When you get the hang of it (which is easier if you're a bit familiar with roleplaying concepts like skills, spells, lifepoints etc), the game's not really that complex at all.  It can be a longish game with many players, or when inexperienced.  It also plays with only 1 or 2 players, but then using  multiple investigators is recommended.  AH is not for everyone - so choose your invitees with a little care - but for the right people it's a blast.

I keep feeling as though this should be an awesome game. It requires a massive table, there are lots of cool places to go on the map and there are so many decks of cards with so many interesting things in them, however the whole game just seems to drag along endlessly. Players take turns moving about the map, visiting areas to gather items or kill monsters or any number of other things all in a co-operative race to seal the gates before the big greebly gets through and causes a showdown. I suppose in the 80s this would have been a superb game but in this day in age, there are much more interactive, immersive games available.

RATING: 9.5
I love Lovecrafts's Cthulhu mythos and I also love classic RPGs. This game is combination of both. It's engaging, strategic, with a bit of luck involved. Sometimes can be very mean, but since it's a co-op, this fact is mitigated by affecting the whole group. What I really hate about this game is the devour feature. Player elimination (even though you can make a different character... which takes you only like 10 minutes... or more...) in such a long game just gets on my nerves. This is the longest game I really enjoy all the time still, just wished the players were hindered not eliminated, but that wouldn't be thematic I guess. Anyway, great game, after many years of playing haven't got tired of it. Still a long game, needs to be planned ahead, usually we play 2-3 games one day during weekend once in a while. Like it very much.

Revised: 11/14/2016:  Well, after a year or so and a dozen games, give or take, I'm upping it back up... to a 7.5.  It's just fun, as long as I somewhat check my brain at the door, and it's just so darn thematic.  The huge problem is that the rulebook is AWFUL.  A better rulebook would fix so many problems with the unruly aspects of the game.  

Still, it's good stuff, and I'm glad I gave it another chance after many years away.

Revised: 11/10/2015:  Acquired in trade with Wrath of Ashardalon, for Evolution and Merchants & Marauders.

Looking forward to hopefully getting this to the table with one or two other interested players and seeing how it goes over!

***

With the right crowd, I'm game, but I do prefer actual RPGs to this style of co-op.  Having said that, Arkham is very cool, tightly designed, richly themed.  All in all, thumbs up!

Revised (06/15/09) Down to a 6.5 from a 7... it's fun, but I wonder at the lack of interesting decisions oftentimes.  It does seem like the game comes down to the draw of a card or the roll of a die more often than a tough decision, and that makes it less interesting to me.  Maybe if there were more cards that made you try and pick the lesser of two (or three or more!) evils...

This is the Agricola of cooperative games for me.  I love variety and variability in a game and in that respect, this game is after my heart and has claimed it.

First of all, this game is deceptively less complicated than the rulebook and number of components would have you think.  Also, as a cooperative game you simply need one player who knows the rules well enough to "run the game" so the other players can learn by doing.

The amount of variety and variability in just the base game are staggeringly awesome.  There are 16 different characters for players to choose, 8 different Ancient Ones for the players to fight, huge decks of cards for every situation, many locations with special abilities on them.  The rules system, while like I said not that complicated, is also deep and incredibly thematic.  I would expect nothing less from the King of "Ameritrash".

I will say that you probably need more than 2 players to really have a good chance of tackling this game.  While a lot of things in this game scale with the number of players making it seem balanced across all player numbers (for example the number of successes needed to remove a doom token from the Ancient One and monster limits), one thing that you always get with more players is more opportunity to do stuff,  which means closing more gates, killing more monsters, and more time for players to go shopping.  With just two players you fall behind in both closing gates and killing monsters and are too busy mitigating both of these to really collect stuff for the inevitable fight with the Ancient One (you would have to be really talented/lucky to end a 2-player game without fighting the Ancient One).

I think the magic number of players is 4 as going to 5 puts two monsters in play each turn and to that end if you play with two I would play with each player playing two investigators.  5-8 still wouldn't be too bad since each player still gets to take a turn compared to one gate opening every turn (even with two monsters) and has me wonder why you score more for more players.  I personally think greater player numbers and actions each turn outweighs the monster limit/Ancient One combat number especially since these just seem to attempt to balance as the number of players increase.  3 might also be okay, though challenging but I haven't played with this number yet.

Also, the fight with Yig (suggested for a shorter game) feels just a little too truncated to really experience the game.  I would suggest not playing against this Ancient One if you do have the time for a standard length game (2.5-3 hours) as it might end before you really get to take it all in.  And there's a lot of good stuff to take in here.

I really, really like the concept.  I've never read Lovecrafts books but I understand what they were about.  All things being equal I just can't get myself to invest the time in this game.

There's a lot of game here for certain. Don't care for the huge amount of space needed - I have to use my miniatures wargame table setup to play. There's atmosphere aplenty, but so far I feel that I'm playing to beat the game rather than feel that I'm immersed in Lovecraft's world. I hope this will change soon before I put the game away on a dusty shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is sometimes a little bit light-hearted in the theme area--I like my Lovecraft relentlessly dark and bleak, with no machine guns or private eyes. Too much fiddlyness too (having to move those monsters all the time is a special pain), and the rules are just too much, with a ton of stuff to get straight and remember every turn---get ready for a constant parade of clunky modifiers and exceptions, some of which you'll simply forget to apply. While it may feel like work to a casual gamer, it could certainly be fun for a well-seasoned one, with lots of variety, especially with the expansions (watch out, though--they only add to the complexity). Basically a must-try for Mythos freaks...IF they know what they're getting into.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unlike it's original version (Chaosium, 1987), it suffers from a heavy lack of atmosphere. A co-operative game with a huge size and astonishing artwork, but with redundantly over-complicated mechanism, and no mood at all. Boring.
While the original version (Chaosium, 1987) is highly redommended for all Mythos-fans, this one is an unworthy successor. It could have been so much better...

So this is Ameritrash. Great amount of FUN, more akin to my previous experiences of role playing than to current boardgaming. Lots of tension and variety, enjoy the game most when the result feels as its in the balance. Last hour of second game became a bit of a grind - 5 gates sealed and nothing but monster surges. sweet spot 4/5 players? With the right gamers this is can be an unforgettable expereince. With a game of this complexity it is handy to be shown the ropes by an experienced player.

First play did not use any expansions which is apparantly why we won.  Seems like an ok game, I can see how it would suffer from downtime with expansions added. The more I think about it, I don't have much desire to replay this.  Edit:  I really like the Call of Cthulu mythos and feel I need to revisit this.  I think I just need to find the right players who can really get into the theme, as well as move the game along at a good clip.

Takes a lot of time to set up but a good game to impress new players and easy to start since it's co-op. Love the Lovecraft theme and artwork. Best with 2-4 players. Starts losing its magic after 10–15 plays or so. There are plenty of expansions.

Definitely not a game for newbie gamers, but also not as complicated as the initially-overwhelming rulebook would suggest.  Once I got the hang of it I really started enjoying this game.  Pro Tip - DO NOT try to learn this game as you play it the first time through.  We made that mistake and it really ruined the first experience.  Thankfully we came back a second time after I took the time to really get to know the rules, and it was MUCH better from that point on.

I pretty much love everything about this game! It's really everything I want in a boardgame, there's nothing like settling down to a couple of hours in Arkham. Things like the cardboard stand-ups for investigators, and the chits for monsters, both really let the game down. But the Mansions of Madness miniatures are easily used to replace them. The mechanics, the theme, I just love it all!

Lots of good memories, but I think that EH is more likely to hit the table now (lowering my rating accordingly)

It's not a terrible game, but they should have thrown half of the rules (and decks) out for a tighter, more streamlined experience. As it is, it is WAY too rules heavy to be much fun.

It's a shame as it drips with theme, but the deck rules and monster movement/placement rules murder it.

At first an excellent thematic experience that really draws you in, further aided by the stunning visuals. However, after this initial hype wears off, the actual gameplay starts to show its many flaws. In theory I don't mind the lengthy playtime; I even love it providing the game stays interesting throughout. But Arkham Horror doesn't at all. Already after a few turns the game becomes tedious and repetitive, and there the fiddliness of it all really starts to annoy. Even though it is definitely hard to beat the Ancient One, it is not particularly [i]challenging[/i]. Luck triumphs over strategy at almost every point in the game through overly present dice rolling and drawing of random cards, which makes me feel powerless and indifferent about the final result. Overall, this game is very disappointing.

Great fun after the first few plays. Leaves me wanting for more. I hope we can play this frequently, even with the long playing time.

An amazing game.  Cooperative and with a very strong theme.  Sure, it's more Dereleth than Lovecraft, but it is -fun-!  The huge number of expansions add a great variety so that no two games are ever quite the same.  One of the best 'RPG' lite boardgames on the market.

So far, I've only played it solo, but as a one player board game its surprisingly engaging. Very well themed and there are a ton of little nuances that link back to it's source material. One such example: the creature Hound of Tindalos can attack any investigator, regardless of distance, as long as they are in a location. This is because in the Mythos story where they appeared, they emerge from the angles of corners of rooms. Lots of cool stuff like this for people familiar with the Mythos tales.

update: Finally played several games with others and it still holds its appeal. Happy to play this solo or with friends.

RATING: 4
In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits drowning in 210 different types of card, 4000 tokens, and a partidge in a pear tree. (Look at the Arkham Horror component list -- it's all there.) It's a typical Fantasy Flight mess, with a bag full of tokens where a slider would do, hundreds of dice rolls, and a lot of unnecessary chrome. 

It's not what you would call a "strategy game": it's a "thematic game", or to use my preferred terminology, an "experience game". Players take the role of colourful Cthulhu Mythos characters, investigating mysterious occurrences in the fictional New England city of Arkham -- soon to be the site of a dimensional breakthrough by one of the great old ones, who will devour the world: Azathoth, the Daemon Sultan, the Blind Idiot God; Yog-Sothoth, the Lurker at the Threshold; Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods; Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos.

Mechanically the game is not interesting; turns generally consist of going to locations and resolving random events. The enormous luck factor can occasionally result in a game that is either a cakewalk or an impossibility, but I assume anyone playing an experience game doesn't mind that sort of thing. The only actual problems are the lack of variety in location cards and that it doesn't always scale well between player counts -- some old ones are virtually impossible with fewer than four investigators and perhaps far too easy with eight. The variety issue is solved by the expansions.

Though the ludic part of the game consists largely in resolving random events, its charm is in the rich flavour of those events and the items and monsters encountered along the way. Let go and enjoy the ride and it's a lot of fun. In fact, the biggest criticism I have is that it provides too much faux-game chrome -- when it works, it works because it's telling a story. As such, most players really would be better served playing a Lovecraftian RPG like Call of Cthulhu. Roleplaying demands a good group with a good GM, but can provide immeasurably richer and more satisfying narrative experience.

It's not unenjoyable, though, and I might still have decided to keep it if it didn't take four hours and up. That's just too long to spend for an experience as shallow as this one. Better to read a good book for the story and play a real game for the game.

Role playing is always fun, but we tend to have big groups, and so it never feels like there's a threat or challenge...but this game has proven to be pretty fun at times.  Essentially just a guided D&D sorta game.  Dice rolling at its finest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The strength of Arkham Horror lies mainly in the theme. There is a strong atmospheric element and a hint of role-playing that makes the game special.

I wouldn't turn down a game of AH, but for me it is not special and I would rather play something else if I had the chance. The role-playing element is not something I look for in board games, having been a D&D player myself. The mental challenge is limited and there is a lot of dice rolling. Although the co-op nature of the game is appealing, there is no remedy for the alpha male effect (someone who knows the game better determining all players' moves). The amount of components and cards creates an illusion of replayability, but we ended up winning in the same manner every time.

It's not all that bad - it's still fun to set up your character, find and buy equipment and slaughter monsters. Just not my favourite.

RATING: 5
I was a playtester on this, I have exhausted this game to death.  Once you do that, the fun is pretty much gone.  I'd say it's a great big box game for Lovecraft fans, but otherwise there are too many un-needed bits and mechanics that make me drawn to something like Touch Of Evil instead.

- Randomness (the games plays itself alone), really few meaningfull choices.

Low lighting/appropriate music , mandatory reading of events/flavor texts might improve gameplay.

RATING: 3
Formally there doesn't seem to be any point playing them other than solo - except for the social element of course. I wish there was something in the game which explicitly uses that there are several players. Like some personal information/goals or something, so you at least had some actual point with being a group (one of the players could be a secret "bad" guy, without the others knowing it, etc.)

The universe is interesting (The Cthulhu Mythos, conceived by Lovecraft in the beginning of the century).

After having tried it a few times, I find the game extremely tedious and fiddly, not very atmospheric during actual gameplay, and somehow without anything interesting in its mechanics and construction.

100% cooperative, RPG-like boardgame in the Lovecraftian (and firends) world. Featuring a great diversity of characters, gadgets and monsters, this sometimes leads to fiddly play (especially with new players). But once you are in it's a great team game.
Unlike many such games, the characters start fully developed and equiped, gathering some additional things (positive and negative) over the game instead of starting as an untrained child and ending as Conan.

Game steeped in theme and fun.  Co-op game with excellent amount of player interaction.  The combat system is simple and elegant.  minimal downtime.  Game replay value is high.  The rules are well written with examples but could be better organized.  Components are excellent - mounted board, thick chits, card stock player mats, and somewhat durable cards.  Artwork is very good.  Game length is about 2.5 hours which feels right.

The game that got me into loving board games. Lots of fun, great narrative with each card pull, and good ambiance. The only downside is a long setup time, because there are quite a few pieces and card decks to shuffle; and the sometimes long gameplay time.

Only kept from a 10 because it really isn't for everyone. It's clunky and fiddly (lots of dice rolling and multiple modifiers to keep tabs on), but if you (and the rest of your party) can invest the time and are willing to immerse yourself in it, the inevitable disaster which will unfold before you (as you try, and fail, to control the monsters loose in Arkham and seal the gates which are popping up at a seemingly unmanagable rate) is a joy to be part of.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I played in an eight player game.  A couple of the players were very experienced and knew the rules well, most of us it was the first time playing.  The game did not go over very well.  I think with eight players, especially with mostly new players, it just didn't work.  It took WAY TOO LONG.  I would be willing to try this game again and was into the theme but I doubt that some of the players would ever be willing to give it a second play after our game of it.  Eventually we gave up, because we were getting terrible luck the monster was going to come through and over half of the people were recovering in the hospital, with very few good items.  I would say the main complaints were that it was confusing to always know what was going on, and mostly people were just bored with how long it was taking.  I would like to try it again with like 3 or 4 players and see if it would play faster and be more fun.

Oh Arkham, I will never stop singing your praises.

So, in the interest of full disclosure: I love co-op games.  If you do not like co-op games, please remove yourself from the vicinity of Arkham Horror.  

Okay, now, let's get this out of the way.  There are flaws in Arkham Horror.  Even one who loves it as much as I has to admit this.  The rules are numerous and have strange facets and interactions that could fill a novel with errata and FAQs.  There are seventeen gazillion little fiddly bits, so you will need lots of plastic bags and/or pill cases and/or fishing tackle boxes.  FFG churns out expansions for this at a steady pace, meaning that if you're a completionist or an expansion addict (Hi, that's me), you will be broke and have a closet taken up by this game alone.  Finally, it's lengthy; it often takes 3-4 hours, and can easily exceed that when you're playing with near the maximum number of players.

Now, on to the good stuff.  This game drips with theme and tension.  It can be brutal when you're unlucky, and brutal even when you're lucky (though sometimes, mysteriously, goddesses and gods will smile on you and you will have a smooth game).  There are tons of decisions to be made, and it's often never clear which is the right choice.  This makes it, I think, more enjoyable for newbies than some other co-ops, because there's a lot less of the "Loudest and most analytical person running everyone else's turn" problem.  It's hard to say "You should go here and do this" when, really, anywhere you go could either kill you or give you a great item depending on whether the game hates you or not (Hint: it hates you).  You have to approach it as a fun experience and be ready to lose.  Like a good role-playing game, you leave with lots of funny and exciting memories that you can be discussing for weeks to come (like the time your investigator nearly threw themselves into a well to their death on their FIRST ENCOUNTER, or the time your investigator got beaten up by a monster and woke up in the hospital with.. Tuberculosis?!?).

I love this game so much. :3

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE:  There is some necessary color-distinguishing going on here, but it's a co-op, which makes asking someone or putting someone else in charge of the color-dependent parts fairly easy.  In particular, Arkham location encounter and Other World gate cards are color-coded.  The former I've managed to adapt to by getting good at matching the pictures of the locations on the backs of cards rather than colors--this is a fairly necessary move since the colors are often very similar shades of blue-purple versus straight purple or yellow-green versus sickly yellow.   The Other World cards come in four colors--red, green, blue, and yellow--with no other pictures for distinguishing.  Luckily, I find that they're pretty bright shades that I can tell apart, but people with more advanced red-green colorblindness may have trouble.

UPDATE 3/3/09:  Okay, I finally admitted it.  I downgraded AH from a 10 to a 9.  I have to admit that there are a few problems with the game that are really starting to impede my enjoyment.
1) The difficulty is incredibly inconsistent.  We win some games without breaking a sweat.  Others are long, tense, wonderfully drawn-out battles.  Others are forgone conclusions that manage to still stretch over hours.  It's hard to convince myself to spend the large amount of time to teach, setup, and play the game when I'm not even sure if it will be hard enough to feel climactic and enjoyable.

2.) Fiddliness.  This is FFG at the height of their bizarre obsession with overproduction.  Setup and tear-down take FOREVER.  Digging through billions of chits--and, yes, I'm well-organized, it's not like I have them all in a giant heap--gets annoying.  It's not a game-breaking problem but it's frustrating.  If I had a devoted cat-free room where I could leave the game set up I wouldn't be so bothered, but, y'know.  Not that rich. Yet.

3.) Occasionally stagnant.  This goes with the inconsistent difficulty thing.  There will be times where the game just.. sits.  You're at more or less an impasse--no one has any good options, they're trapped behind monsters and constantly being sent to the hospital or something, and yet the game isn't advancing, no new gates opening.  Maybe it's clear that you're going to lose or win, but it could take another hour to get there, even if only the most wild act of [deity] could change that.  It occasionally goes on far too long in this way. 

I still love the game.  It's still a great -experience-, but as a game it has some serious downsides, and some more recent co-ops (particularly Ghost Stories) have hurt my desire to play Arkham as much.

Kinda train wreck of a game.  Seemed very repetitive and took absolutely forever. Then the monster came out and either we kicked it's butt easily, or it totally destroyed us.  Seemed to make the entire 3 hour prelude to the final battle completely meaningless.  I suppose we should have tried to close all the gates, but that seemed next to impossible.

05.12.2007, very good theme integration. Unfortunately, the somewhat cumbersome game mechanics are not very good supported... e.g., the flying ability (among other specialties) of some monsters is color coded instead of adding a small wing icon on the chit, thus forcing the players to remember what color means what.

Played this during my 'get unplayed games played' phase and it was an enjoyable solo experience - I can see myself reaching for this when I've got an open evening with some hours to kill. The game took about four hours, with about an hour of this lost to me with my head in the rulebook trying to figure out how each little bit works. Really tough on new players, but a great game in their. Once I've figured out how to play it, and the rules queries are sorted out, I can see the narrative become incredibly immersive.

Update - Can't see the point in owning this when Eldritch does it easier, quicker, and better with less distraction.

RATING: 8
Having played 4 games at this point, I see what the problem is with length in a 5+ player game.  With 4, there is no issue, especially once the rules are understood by all.  There is essentially no downtime, which is another complaint I just don't understand.  If anything, players are going to be uncertain when their movement phase comes around where precisely they should go because they haven't analyzed all their options yet.  I feel that the endgame battle adds significantly to the experience, rather than being a huge dicefest letdown - the players must plan extensively for the fight, and they're either going to live or die depending on whether or not they had a chance to get the right things before the old one shows up.  For Yig, for example, everyone needs to be blessed before the fight.  All in all, it's better than Lord of the Rings, which makes it the best cooperative game on the market in my book.  Is it too easy?  Not sure yet - the game gets easier the more players are added, that's for sure.

There's a lot I enjoy here; I love the pseudo-RPG nature and the enormous variety in the game.  But the set up time and clutter factor are huge.  Its so much work for so little return.  I keep wondering things like:
* Why is so much of the board useless space?
* Why do we need two dozen bland encounter decks that all amount to the same thing?  
* Why do I draw a card, which tells me to go draw a different card, which you can only get via the first card?  Why not just print the damn rules on the first card and keep it!
* Why didn't they stop to think that telling you to go locate a specific card out of a 200 card deck that's a pain to shuffle might be a bad idea?

Back when there were few co-ops, I loved to play this.  As more and more good co-ops come out, my interest has been steadily dropping.  If there was a way of de-cluttering it and tightening up the challenge level, my rating would go up a lot.

House rules:
----------
* A new gate gives a monster but no doom token.
* A duplicate gate gives a doom token and monster.
* A sealed gate gives a monster surge.
----------
* Don't reduce ally pile.  Instead, when you recruit from Ma's draw 10-terror allies to pick from.
----------
In a final battle, the GOO has +7 doom tokens, -2 per sealed gate.  So, with 3 sealed gates the GOO has +1 token; with 5 sealed it has -3.

I finally got to play one of the all-time Ameritrash classics.  It's so full of atmosphere which creates a great level of immersion.  There's a nice story laid out every time you play it which gives you something to remember long after your session.

This game has a LOT of rules.  It's long, and it's quite fiddly.  If you can get past that it's fun.  For me it's a bit of a turn off.  That said I'd play this anytime with the right group of friends.

I rated this so highly for the theme combined with some very fun gameplay. The gameplay has some flaws but they are fixed in the Dunwich Horror expansion (gate surges, for example). 

This game can suffer a little bit if one player has some bad luck. It's possible to fall into a death spiral where you die, become worse off, then die again as a result. If noone minds, this game is amazing, but I understand why it's not everyone's cup of tea.

This is lovecraft in a box however it is very fiddly. You won't remember every rule and it is recommended to consult a flow chart while playing.

This game offers a lot of things other games don't. It's co-op done right with a lot of freedom of choices together with a fantastic theme. First of all this game is very different to any other game I have ever owned or played. Mixed in with great components you have a winner in my book. Only drawbacks are the few rules ambiguities that sneak in and that the game length might be on the longer side. Otherwise fantastic!

RATING: 8
Cooperative adventure game set in the world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. The game revolves around a group of investigators attempting to prevent one of the 'ancient ones' from entering the town of Arkham. In order to do this they need to defeat a number of monsters and close gates to the 'other worlds'. All skill checks in the game are straightforward where you have to roll a five or a six on a variable number of d6 depending on modifiers and this determines the outcomes of combat, luck, will etc. The game can be a frustrating experience for some players who invariably have to spend the majority of the game acquiring objects just to pass them on to the their team-mates who then use them to do the fun stuff with them i.e. battle and explore the other worlds and close the gates. I love the 1920s setting and as always Fantasy Flight has done a great job with the artwork and presentation. This isn't a game for everyone due to the theme and there can be a lot of downtime with a higher number of players (there can be a maximum of eight), but Arkham Horror is one of the best cooperative games out there as well as being one of the best games with a horror theme.

For a game that has some much packed into the box you'd expect to have tons of decisions to make and things to do but no. No. Sure you have to make choices often enough but each 'decision' is such a microcosm of insignificant obviousness that it doesn't really matter. 




waiting..... 





By far the most important game mechanism is the group optimization puzzle that is where each player plans to move. Usually the solution is straightforward but even if there are two worthy options it doesn't really matter which you choose as how the dice fall is vastly more important to your success or failure.




waiting.....





The poor fool running the game has 4 hours of tedious bookkeeping to keep him entertained. Imagine the fun of tracking monster counts, special monster types, bad guy abilities, rumour cards and various player abilities all whilst everyone else yawns and waiting for you to hurry it all up.  (First few games problem I'll admit) 





waiting.....




Still it's better than being a player where each turn is a matter of drawing and reading a card, rolling some dice or just 'experiencing the story'. But the events in game and the cards never really come together to create something memorable other than by sheer chance so the little value is quickly crushed by the constant




waiting..... 




As a story/social experience there is some value to be had but as a game it's just not good. Let me be clear. It's not any worse than other co-op games in this style (Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot, LotR) but their brevity reduces their offence whilst this revels in it. So if you think those are great then this is too.

RATING: 6
Co-op game where all players try to prevent an other worldly creature from coming to our world and devouring everyone and everything.  Plays 1-8 players.  Very thematic.  

An other worldly creature is opening portals to try to come into our world.  Monsters pour out of these portals.  If enough portals open, the creature will enter our world and can destroy everyone.

Players are investigators who need to find enough clues and items to close enough of these portals to prevent the creature from coming to our world.  They must navigate the town of Arkham and avoid or fight off these creatures.  Different areas will give different items and resources to help in closing these portals and fight off these monsters.

This is a pretty old game.  I gave it a lower rating because there are some newer games that have a similar theme that has improved mechanics.  Still this is a sentimental classic for me.  I still get a sense of horror when playing this game.  The game can drag out a bit towards the end, but it is still fun bashing monsters while you finish closing off the last of the portals you need to win.

Some good stuff going on here, but ultimately too many loops and downtime - missing turns? Not in this century matey. Lame battle at the end as well. Atmosphere is excellent at times, poor at others. Amazing components. For a game with this much potential, I have to say they missed a trick, and the replayability is likely to be low. Could also be very long. I am holding the base game pending release of the expansion which could save it.

This game is slowly going down on my lists. Main problem is the fact that a lot of games get ruined by players who should not play this game. Aka Ruleslawyers, people who cannot pronounciate English or do not care for the story. Without the story Arkham becomes a borring game in wich players just randomly do sometimng.

Gonna give this game a last try with a good friend of mine and some other people whom like a nice story. If it does not work during that game, then I will keep the game for Solo play only,

Great conversion to boardgame for the "Call of Cthulhu" world. Probably the game suffers the same problem of many similar games (Talisman & Co.)where every player builds his power as much as possible and then goes in war. Anyway for me remain a good game to be played with Lovecraft's background fans.

Great game. You've really got to coordinate with the other players to get things done in a sane amount of time (though you should expect a long game). Great for Lovecraft fans, such as myself, and even for many non-fans that I know.

A very strong thematic experience. 

Despite all those fiddly rules that you probably will overlook, this game is great fun if you play it right, to idulge yourself in a pulp version of Lovecraft's tales of madness that is.

Be sure to organize your components properly to avoid a tedious setup and get Innsmouth Horror, which is essential to the overall experience.

- Excellent solo play, expands from one player to six player with ease in my experience. The game itself supports up to eight players but I have yet to try this.
- Co-op game, take on the role beating the game a as team of investigators, closing all or sealing six other world dimension portals or failing that meet the the Great Old One in a final battle of victory or defeat (see get devoured).
- Lots and lots of theme, in the world of Lovecraft.
- Every play is a new experience, with different investigators, Great Old Ones, items, spells, and of course horrible monster encounters and great encounters with new allies to help you in your quest of saving Arkham and ultimately the world.
- Variety in play with a cost, this game comes with several expansions (see money drainer) that are great and make for a different experience as they can be both integrated into the base game and play a supporting role. And of course they can be combined as well to some extent (see dilution).
- Difficult at times, but losing makes winning next time all the more sweeter.

Cooperative game. Like most FF games it throws a lot of rules and bits at you from the start, but after a few turns everything feels natural. There is no diplomacy or back-stabbing, so it's closer to Pandemic and Forbidden Island than it is to Battlestar Galactica or Shadows Over Camelot.

I am not a huge fan of the genre of roll a handful of dice and hope for the best. However this one really has a lot going for it. Theme being its biggest selling point. The stories that come up between players and the text of the card make this a memorable experience every time it hits the table. I look forward to giving it a try with the expansions.

As described by Greg Pettit (Gregarious) whom I have never met, but stole my thoughts when he described the game thusly;

You mean we've spent all this time wandering around this asylum fighting random monsters, gathering tools, and losing our sanity waiting for this thing, and now it's just a die roll? Why the hell didn't we just wake up Cthulu three friggin' hours ago?

I want to love this game, but I have yet to play it with others.  My solo play with 2 characters seemed a bit overwhelming.  I like the idea of all the equipment, spells, etc.  And the different stats, which while some are subtle, become noticeably different during play.  I'm hoping having only a single character will help, as well as having others to play with.

Update: Played a 5 player game.  Much easier to keep track of things when I only have one character to worry about.  Used some of the expansion pieces/rules, but mostly a base game setup.  This is not a game about strategy or tactics really...mostly just about story.  Play to enjoy the story and you'll love it!

I thought this was an interesting game.  It was kind of fun.  But tended to drag and get repetitive after a while.  There was also a descent amount of downtime in the game.  

I only got one play with seven players though.  I'd be interested in trying it with less players probably next time.  Might also make it a little more challenging, as the group didn't seem to be in very much danger during our game.

After three plays it was enjoyed, but the length was such that I knew it would not be able to hit the table often so I traded it away.  The game requires a lot of interaction with all the bits which can drag on a game turn and thus leave downtime at the borderline of fun when you are waiting for your turn to come back around.

Played it with wife--we started setting it up on Friday night. She almost fell asleep during the rule reading. We left the game setup overnight and started the game the next day. This a medium-heavy game that requires focus, but it can be lots of fun. Not so hard if you work together (of course, I only battled Yig!). It's nice to have a co-op game.
I originally rated this a 6, but after the second and third play, we had MUCH more fun considering we knew the rules. Setup gets quicker, too :)

While the rules to this game are a bit hard to digest, it is at its core a thematic, semi role-playing game.  We made some of our own house rules to combat some of the seemingly unnecessary restrictions laid out in the rules.  I would also say that once you understand how the game is played, the game is too easy.  It takes a while to play, but that's okay if you are sitting around joking and snacking and having a good time.  I would play it most days for that reason.

I really wish I had more opportunity to play this game. I admit, it is a little convoluted, but having someone to more-or-less GM the thing makes things a little smoother--things stay on track, the GM takes care of the monsters and players can help keep things moving along. I love just how fantastically one can fail at this; it's really hard to win, but it definitely has been a lot of fun for me. One caveat to those looking to pick it up: Play with the right people. I would not recommend it for the casual boardgamer. Best played with people who love boardgames and are not afraid of a little management.

I like cooperative games, and the theme is well done.  The components are beautiful, but the gameplay isn't cohesive.

Let me just say this, I dislike long games.  I've wanted to play this since it came out but I could never justify pulling it out due to that time factor.  I'm a Lovecraft fan so that put an extra urge to give it a try.  Finally a few months back I picked it up, It sat on the shelf and gathered dust. Last night the stars were right, the old ones stirred.  Taking the role of Bob the Traveling salesman our quest began.

DEAR SWEET ELDERGOD, how did all that time fly by.  I've played hour long euro games that held my attention far less than this eldritch monstrosity!  We had 4 players, 2 who had played the classic and 2 new to the whole thing (I was one of the later).  I realized through Arkham Horror that I REALLY needed to get some adventure game into my system, this one was the yellow king of that genre.  While these games always put an unforetold pressure on space and time, taking up lots of room and lasting very long.  For the game itself, I found the length and pacing may be slow.  However despite it's length, you never really notice the time fly. I would have figured the play time would have ruined my sanity... turns out I was wrong.  Bob's sanity on the otherhand was something else entirely.

The rules are extremely fiddly on the grand scale with many questionable mechanics, this is not something I would feel comfortable playing with non gamers by any stretch of the imagination.  On an individual note the mechanics are quite simple, its the over all game itself that gets boggy.  Which in upon itself made it feel like it SHOULD have lasted longer.  Highly random, wildly stacked against the players and full of absolute chaos sums up the mechanics.  Monster Surges happened to us constantly, we had a board full of hellish nightmare spawn and the pressure was constantly on.  Portals proved very difficult to close and the university experiment forced some heavy combat to take place.  This is a brilliant cooperative game with many unique twists.  I really like the skill slider mechanic and the characters individual uniqueness.  The combat is pretty dice heavy (especially with items) which I'm not all that keen on, but it works.  It strikes me that with more than 4 players the game would be easier but have FAR more downtime.  All and all Arkham Horror is definitely getting more play and I am eager to add in the Dunwich Horror expansion.  Spending hours losing sanity has never been so fun.

For me simply the best game of 2005!
I haven´t played a single game that often in the last three years and everyone I introduced it to loved it. You really don´t have to be a H.P. Lovecraft-fan to enjoy this game. Actually, most people in my group don´t know Lovecraft at all.
The theme is great and it´s just plain fun exploring the town of Arkham. There are some very nice and novel game mechanics (the sliders for character attributes for example) and once you get the hang of it, the game moves very smoothly.
The main problem of the game is the rulebook. The rules, which are not that simple to begin with, are presented in a very confusing way and you will find yourself browsing forwards and backwards in the hope of finding the rule you are looking for.
Update May 2007: Ok, I finally did it - I gave my first 10-rating. I guess after over 60 plays in about 20 months this is due. 
Update November 2010: Have played it only a few times this last year - so I should lower rating.

I think co-op games are stupid. Check. I hate dice. Check. I'm not familiar with Cthulhu mythos and this game is highly thematic. Check. 

I definitely need to be in the right mood and group to play this. Surprisingly though I like it a little. I really get sucked in to the theme (that I'm not even familiar with!) and I like to read back stories of the characters and I'm afraid I'll have nightmares if we lose.

Long and complex. Visually pleasing.

If you're looking for a cooperative, challenging, thematic game set in the world of HP Lovecraft that you can play sporadically with friends on occasions such as Halloween or when you're in a spooky cabin in rural New England, this is probably the game for you. It just does what it says on the box, it's Lovecraft: the Board Game.

That said, however, if you're looking for a fun gaming experience that you'll want to play over and over, I would advise you to steer clear from this game. The basic game play philosophy that was adopted for making this game is that "whatever players choose to do, there will be one of two possible outcomes: either penalties will be incurred or nothing will happen. Whatever the player chooses will have very little influence on this." That is my biggest beef with this game; it conditions you to not want to play it, because everything is done through random negative reinforcement.

Want to fight that monster? First, you'll have to roll for your Sanity, which means you'll either lose Sanity or nothing will happen. Secondly, you'll have to try and fight it, which means you'll either lose Health or nothing will happen, because you rarely get anything from successfully vanquishing monsters.

Want to try and have an encounter in a cool place like the train tracks or the library? Brace yourself for either losing some of your resources or successfully managing to accomplish nothing. Your reward is not getting the penalty. Congratulations.

Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that the game play just tries to convince you that what you're doing is completely futile - which is GREAT as an adaptation of Lovecraft. However, the game succeeds a little too well, and within a few playthroughs, whether you win or lose, I think you'll be thoroughly convinced that your experience was futile.

Unlike a Lovecraft character, though, at least you can stay sane by letting the game accumulate dust.

This game looks nice (and it's Cthulhu).  It took me a few readings to get the rules in my head well enough to try, but it is a BLAST solo (it can actually be creepy, I'm about to play it again with a thunderstorm outside, maybe get my wife to light some candles). It can be even better multi-player, but there is some significant down time with the full compliment of eight players.  Nice, though, that everyone does every phase at that phase, rather than player one does all the phases, then 2 does all the phases, etc.   That would make it drag. Instead, everyone does phase one, starting with player one, then repeat with phase two, etc. Pass the first player marker and repeat.  This way everyone is involved somewhat more frequently (but still, with eight players, there is a wait).  As much as I like thr base game by itself, I think the expansions are handled in this series just beautifully.  If I didn't like this game, I would have a hard time not buying the expansions anyway.  I'm not a collector, but this game certainly makes me think like one, if only for this series.

I enjoy losing no game nearly so much :)

Brilliant co op game.  Fantastic components (all expansions), engaging gameplay.  Rules will take a good few plays to get down, but its worth it.  It becomes intuitive after a few games.

With all expansions, its a serious amount of stuff!!!.. you will need a large table.. Ive pimped it out with the monster miniatures (not all of them yet) and the bag of cthulhu which i use for the first player marker, doom track and terror track tokens, Gate stands, Blessed and cursed dice. Raptor Card Holders.  Ive spent more money on this game than anything else i own.  Would love the investigator minis.
I think this is truly a unique game. My favorite solo game. In my opinion it is the best adventure game ever published (I have no desire to play Eldritch). Indeed maybe my favorite game of all time. Cannot recommend it enough, but it is not for everyone.

I have all expansions mixed in, normally use Dunwich and Kingsport extra boards, Innsmouth only if i want hard mode!., i dont use the Heralds, its hard enough!.  Have the whole game stored in a old wine box.  With this much stuff yoo need a storage/play solution.

Have played: Solo,2,3,4

Playtime from 2-4 players ranges from 3-5 hours.

My Secret Santa 2007 gift - thank you [i]so much[/i] Secret Santa!  I was overjoyed on unwrapping it!

I like this game.  I want to play this game more.  However, that is denied me because it is unbelievably complicated, and somewhat long in comparison to many other games.  Alas, the people I play with get confused so frequently when playing this that I am re-teaching the rules not just every time I try to bring it out, but each time someone's turn comes around again.  Thus, I do not enjoy it, and thus, it is not played.  Had a few fun solo sessions, though.

Revised October 2010 from 6 to 8.5: I finally forced some people to play, and after one learning game, it clicked.  Not everyone enjoyed it, but the ones that did I've now played quite a few times with and it's a blast.  I've since picked up a few of the expansions to keep it fresh.  THANK YOU AGAIN SECRET SANTA, 3 years later.

Good: This game is ridiculously immersive; I can sit and play for 5 hours and not care at all. The theme pretty much *is* the game, but it's brilliantly done and always brings me back. The visual design is great.

Bad: Set-up and tear-down times are excessive and the game length varies wildly.

RATING: 9
Rating stands for all the best expansions parts added, since you may take out some parts of an expansion (e. g. Investigators [character], Skills, etc.) and added to the mix.

For the base game, a solid 7. The 3 points deducted are:
1. The game is too long, too repetitive, and/or too much dice rolling for some people.
2. The game may become anti-climatic when near the game end that either wait for the final battle for too many gates opened; or wait for the final gate be closed. Both of which may take a few turns.
3. The game relys on text on cards for interaction, the combination of card texts and rules may contains plenty of uncertainties. That results in extensive FAQs and specific offical rulings for some conflicts, and FAQs are needed to be checked every gaming sessions to resolve all these problems arised.

Point 1 & 2 can be addressed by various expansion sets. Therefore the current 9 rating.

Point 3 is the major problem of this kind of game system, especially with so many expansions existed. Without some devotions to the game, causal players may be turned off by this jumble of FAQs.

Dropped my rating of this way down after playing the vastly superior, in every way, Eldritch Horror.

Though dripping in theme, the scope (Arkham and with expansions, neighboring towns) is too small, monsters will block you and drag out the game, the story is uneven, and the whole of the game is only vaguely related to or tied to the Ancient One. ALL of which is solved by EH. Just skip this.

RATING: 5
One of the main reasons I got back into gaming.  While I find the game to be frustrating at times, it absolutely oozes theme.  I have been a fan of Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos for 20+ years, so this game really sits well with me.  

That said, it is definitely not for everyone.  It can be tedious to set up and it has lots and lots of rules to remember.  It also is known for difficulty and for long game times. I've had games in excess of 5 hours. I've also won games in under 90 minutes, it really depends on the crowd and their knowledge of the game.  I can also definitely see those who are not interested in the theme not enjoying the game anywhere near as much as I do.

However, I feel that if you have any interest in the Cthulhu mythos at all, you owe it to yourself to at least try the game.  If you like the idea of a small band of investigators facing down a horrible ancient slimy tentacled evil, then this is your game.  If you like theme and lots of fiddly bits, then this is your game.  And if you like that the next card you flip could spell doom for not only your team, but for the world, then this is your game!

I often say Arkham is my favorite game, but it is a game that requires me to set aside a large chunk of time to dedicate to it.  As such, it is not rated as a 10.  It requires time and effort to get a group to play, so I don't want to play it as often as other games.

I really like cooperation games in general, and this one is pretty immersive.  I didn't really know the Cthulu universe at all when I first played, but that wasn't a problem.  A caveat, though:  it can take a while, and if the players aren't in to the story aspect of the game, it will most likely drag.

Once the rules have been deciphered this game is actually very pleasant to play, it is easy to get bogged down by all the bits and cards and rules, but my advise would be play with someone who knows how to play or do what I did and watch a coupke of games on YouTube,  that way the mechanics of the game are broken down and it all sort of clicks into place.
This makes Arkham a very enthralling emersive game!
Although it can take a whike to get into the swing of things!,

What a great moody game that tells you very quickly, "This is not about winning, it's about the story."  In my first game I watched powerlessly as one-by-one all of my potential allies were murdered by a serial killer running through town (as if all of the terrible gate-spawn were not enough!)  And to finish things?  My shining ray of hope was extinguished as both of my investigators were devoured in the final battle.  Hurray!

I've played this 4 times now and it is truly outstanding. Can't think of another game that really builds in such an oppressive edgy atmosphere so well (and remains so faithful to Lovecraft's spirit). Every game is very tense because it is always a knife-edge whether the investigators or Cthuhlu win.
Highly Recommended.
Update moved from 8 to a 9 on 5th play. Still just as fresh as the first time I played.

I love Cthulhu and with Arkham Horror, we get more than that of Lovejoy. The game takes really long to set up and the box inserts aren't the best either, so lovers of the series definitely have to find a solution. For example foam core.
Unfortunately my group did a lot of failures on our first run and got really depressed. Nevertheless we still enjoy it.

TL;DR Boring

This game can easily last 4+ hours when playing with 6 players.  Not fun, choices seem meaningless, so many other things can be played for much more enjoyment.  Most people like it for the atmosphere and nice descriptions but after you slog through it once or twice it loses that charm really fast and you're left with a shell of horror that bores you to death while you fear people forcing you to play it again.

RATING: 6
If you have one good role player in the group, you will have fun when he describes how Sister Mary rushes on the street, emptying her Tommy Gun into the lurking creature out there and preparing herself to jump into the gate to some other world. The game is luck based, especially some event cards can have a huge influence on the outcome. Rules are a mess when you play for the first time, but it is actually not difficult to play.

Reduced rating from 8 to 6 after the last game night. We had some new players and all were too impatient to accept rules lookup during each turn. And with the mess of rules it was of course necessary and took a lot of time o look up information. The last play was some time back, so we had too look up monster movement, monster abilities, gate limits, monster limits - a lot of stuff. The game was horrible, and ended rather suddenly when we realized that we overlooked the gate limit... 

(The German rules may be worse than the English rules: They made some obvious mistakes like on the GOO-card of Hastur which says you need clues to close gates [wrong info] and that he makes you roll on luck to defend [but the rules use him as example and say it is will]).

Wow.  After initial play, this game won't see much playing time.  However, AH is one fantastic game.  Theme is a little on the weird side, but I knew that going in.  I wanted to play it as an activity, not a theme.  And man does it deliver in spades.  The first game I have ever played where the dice are thrown time and time again, and it did not bother me.  A very long and involved game that makes you feel as if you earned every bit of your quest.  Great, myriad bits, wonderful interaction, and replayability all over the place.  Can't wait to play again, whenever that will be.

UPDATE: 1/30/08--Two recent plays have only solidified my initial thoughts on the game.  At the end of a game, two thoughts emerge:

1.  I really worked to win this game.  I earned it.
2.  I know I messed up something along the way.

Very good game nonetheless.

For me, this is the best adventure type game. Tons of variety in a great world. Easy to play once you get a game or two under your belt, but it does have a steep learning curve and takes a bit to setup until you get a system for doing so. Well worth the entry fee!

RATING: 6
A pretty great game... Hard, but winnable. Co-op (which I prefer) and even solo compatible. Very complex, hard to learn (play with someone who knows how your first game if possible!), but easy to grasp and remember once you finally get it. There's a good mix of randomness and strategy to keep things tactical but also keep things fresh after many, many playthroughs. Major complaint? Setup and tear down are painfully long, and many game endings (win or loss) can anticlimax

Initial impression: I can see in AH the roots of Android, a game I absolutely adore.  What I can't see is why AH is the more popular and widely-acclaimed game.  The mechanics neither promote the theme nor promote compelling or narrative gameplay.  I think both Android and Elder Sign are worthier successors to AH's throne.  But I'm also eager to try a few more games and see how my mind changes....

Later impression: I've come to enjoy this as a solo title, with three or four investigators.  While it doesn't tell very Lovecraftian stories, and doesn't have a ton of interesting decisions, it's entertaining.  With other players the downtime doesn't seem like it would be worth it.

I really, really like this game, but it is soooooo frustrating! Really difficult to win and there is never enough time to do everything you want before the big guy wakes up. 

As an old fan of HP Lovecraft's literature and the genre, I love the atmosphere that the game creates. It really builds the horror well and some of those monsters are best given a wide steer until you can send 'em back where they belong with the judicious closing of a gate.

Depending on the Old One that you get, it seems that it may sometimes be better simply concentrating on gathering whatever is going to help defeat him.

love the theme, the components, the story, the feel, the artwork, the amount of variation.. but for the moment really really hate the rules. Don't they are so hard to remember, and take me out of the game. There is just so much to remember, and it's just to hard. I always die nog even having closed 2 gates, and never had a chance against the ancient one. after an hour, I start getting bored to change skilllevels, mostly pas 'm over, to realize the sneak was very low, and then dying. no fun. But because it's just so cool, I still feel like playing it, hopefully the rules will become an automatic feel
update: lowered it from 6 to 5, because the story gets drowned in all the upkeep, I always lose track of something, and it just goes to slow, it's seems like the only thing I do during a game is opening gates and putting in monsters...
update: raised it from 4 tot 8, because I played it solo, and really like it, funny how a game can grow on someone, still don't know if I can play it with other people though, feel uber-geeky when reading the card aloud... and if they don't enjoy it, I can't..

The big daddy of horror themed board games. While rules  and randomness may at time become just a bit too cumbersome, the game delivers on theme, monster killing, and cooperative play. If you have the time to play a full game with other experienced players, you will surely not be dissappointed

RATING: 10
Hands down one of the best board games around.

I've always been a big Cthulhu Mythos fan - reading H.P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard and others (not to mention playing and running the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game off and on for over two decades) – so of course I love the theme.

But the game play and production values are just outstanding.  I really like the cooperative element (it’s the players vs. the game – not each other).  Also, the game pieces and cards are sturdy and covered with great, evocative artwork.

I currently own all of the expansions.  They all maintain the same high production values that Fantasy Flight Games has become known for (though I personally find that Kingsport Horror is probably the weakest when it comes to game play and concept).

Oh yeah, and don’t forget Strange Eons - an application which you can download for free - which allows you to make your OWN investigators for use with the game.  I personally use Lobster Johnson: The Crimefighter to battle the Ancient Ones and their minions (yes, I’m also a Hellboy/B.P.R.D. fan).

So, if you’re a fan of the Cthulhu Mythos (or just horror fiction in general) and what to play a fun, cooperative game with your friends, then I’d say that Arkham Horror would probably be a must buy.

The theme didn't overcome the mechanical nature of the game for me.  It didn't seem like there were enough decisions to make over the length of the game.  The encounters, particularly in the other worlds, were too 'fun' and not horrific enough.  With the right group, treating it like a role playing game, it can be OK.  I just want more than OK for a game this long.

I have fond memories of playing this in college, because back then it was the only "heavy" game I knew. Now that I have a better sense of how to "game" it, I suspect it will hold up less well, though I'd still like to try with some expansions. But when do I have time for a 4-hour game nowadays?

Only played one learning game plus another game where I felt more confident with the rules. The game is less complex than it appears once you get the basic sequence down. Seems a bit repetitive, which is a worry after only a couple of plays. I'm interested to see how the rating goes after a few more plays.

After half a dozen games I don't feel the game is as repetitive as first thought and once the rules are mastered you can concentrate on the adventure element which is definitely fun. Have also started winning against the Mythos on a regular basis. Rating increased from 6 to 7. Plan is now to play through each of the Great Old Ones in the basic game in order of toughness (Yig to Azathoth) for the next eight games. When they are under my belt it will be time for an expansion to freshen things up.

10 plays: Have now played 10 games and, after losing the first 3, have won the last 7 against the Mythos. Definitely time for an expansion to spice things up. Rating remains a solid 7.
20 plays: Investigators 16; Mythos 4. The game length and set up and tear down times keep it from being an 8. Stays at 7.

One of the few theme-fests in my collection. I didn't know what I was getting into when I bought Arkham Horror, but I'm glad that it's a part of my collection. There's a ton of luck involved, and keeping up with rules can be tedious (and I'm sure I'll always miss something), but the game does tell a story, and getting into the Lovecraftian theme is fun.

Arkham horror, is big, the rules are easy to mess up, and it can bust you up throughout a full game. It have however created some of the best memorable playthoughs I've had so far in a boardgame.

I've heard the new game Eldritch Horror is easier to get into, have a shorter playtime while being just as fun. So I'd recommend that instead.

Seven plays and I'm really still not sure what to think.  It sure doesn't seem like a game that you play to win - it can be easy enough to close enough gates without interacting much with anything (which makes the game pretty boring, since you're avoiding encounters).  I would like to give this another try, but I think it really needs the right crowd.  Problem is, it's darn fiddly for the crowd that might enjoy it most.

RATING: 8
Does a truly awesome job doing the massive Cthulhu mythos to life. The text on the cards properly convey the horrifying, unnerving nature of the events being described. And the game is appropriately challenging - it has never felt easy, and has often felt brutally, cruelly difficult.

It's not without its flaws, though. For one, it makes little sense that all of these horrifying things (which become even more numerous with expansions) take place in one small backwater town. For another, though each event on its own is very thematic, there is no overarching story I could find in it. And the story doesn't much depend on which particular Ancient One the players are fighting - sure, there is the mechanical impact, but the story remains the same for all of them.
Gameplay-wise, the game sometimes feels too random and too fiddly and clunky (the skill sliders and number of hands used by each item being good examples of that).

Because of the flaws (more because of the story flaws than the gameplay flaws), I find this game is completely superseded by Eldritch Horror. Arkham is awesome by itself, but since buying Eldritch I never opened the Arkham box except to sort out the expansion components when I sold it.

15 of the logged plays have used my copy of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.75
This game has a fun theme, and great bits, but it's all in service to a standard dungeon-crawler with more rules than any game needs.  It doesn't feel at all Lovecraftian.  It doesn't help that this is the easiest cooperative game I know of -- though it feels like you're in trouble the first couple times you play, I've never actually lost it.  (My friends tell me that it's gotten harder since they bought the expansions, but I still won the two games I've played since then.) It's not worth it, especially since the game takes about 3 hours (and only the boss battle in the last 10 minutes matters).

Admittedly, it's very difficult to give a board game a Lovecraftian feel.  Maybe the designers should have started from Shadows Over Camelot, the only game I know of that gives the players a sense of dread.

My single experience with this game was with a large group of people at a holloween party. The downtime during setup and while waiting for others to take their turn made it impossible to get into the game.

Letter Grade: B-.  Very big, very brawny.  Clunky, hard to teach, hard to navigate the rulebook, long. [05-08-09]

Great solo play that would work as well with more players.  The atmosphere and difficulty give the game a mounting sense of tension as the game progresses.  A deeply-themed adventure for those who can stomach the length and the involved rules.

9/11/07: Needs a few things for it to work, like time, patience with learning rules, the right crowd, and a proper balance (2-4 characters).  The number of variables in the game means you can almost tune the experience to the sort of session you'd like to have--a strength in an adventure game of this sort.

There's a lot to keep track of, and chances are since it's a co-op game, someone will just know more and run the game themselves.  Also I don't like how even though it's a co-op game there still is an ultimate winner (sort of destroys the spirit of a co-op game). It's also really long.

Pros: Excellent theme and use of Lovecraft properties, well designed componets, great (if recycled from the ccg) artwork. Characters are divers and interesting.

I've been lucky enough to play this with 4-6 seven or eight times now.  There is always laughing, cursing, groaning, and cheering.  It's a theme that draws you in with masterful flavor text and contextual content.  When everyone knows what they're doing, it's an absolute hoot.  You can be the hero in a half a dozen ways. Whether, you're sweeping the streets for monsters, or you're popping in and out of gates clamping them all around town, there's such a great teamwork element to it. I love this game.

Not much fun the first time through. Story and theme are fantastic, as are playing pieces and all the tokens, etc. 

But there really isn't much to do. Pick a random destination. Draw random card. Lose to random monster or bad effect. 

It was so painful to play, I thought the end game rise of the Elder Monster would destroy us utterly, but instead we trounced him which was the only point in the game that actually felt like we were doing anything. 

It's a weird game to play. Good and bad and random all rolled into one. 

I'd play it again, especially with people who know the game, but I likely wouldn't suggest it.

If you can read the rules, once, or even twice, and tell me how to play this game, then you are a God.  The game sounds like great fun.  The mechanics look neat.  There is alot of elements.  Its cooperative which is unique to my game shelf.  But those rules... oh good God... could you be more ambiquious?  

Example:

Go through the portal to the nether realms (see diagram c on page 15), to close the portal (see portal closing on page 3).  Then do a sanity check (see sanity checks on page 18).  If you fail you loose sanity (see going insane on page 6).

I got this because it was a single player game and it is impossible to win by yourself (managing one character). You must make your own modifications to even have a chance, without modding the game and playing by yourself just makes this game discouraging. I usually play with one investigator but simulate a 4 player game. only drawing a mythos every 4 rounds. This variant is actually well balanced for one character. I also find this is best played by yourself as well....set up time is a bit daunting especially with expansions added in

I have never played a game that felt like a video game.  Then again, if I wanted to feel like I was playing a video game.... well I'd play a video game.  Still a good time.  Just a bit on the long side, and a little bit short on the decision side.  After playing LOTR cooperation game, this pales in comparison.  Maybe if I was into the horror theme more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty neat game, I had fun playing it but was a bit disappointed with the big game end monster battle. I'm a huge fan of Lovecraft's work and really get into playing this game for very well done theme and feel.  Obviously the way to win the game is to close and seal the required number of gates.  If you allow the Cthulhu beast out…you pretty much lose, which is accurate from the books, but that crazy dice fest of a battle leaves something to be desired game-wise.  I'm thinking if each monster had an attack, a multiple attack, a special attack, a bind attack that held players, etc...see different types of attach, then a random way of determining what attack it used, and what not, it'd be a little bit of spice for the game.

UPDATE: I got to play the original 80's version of the game and Looooovvvveeeedddd it so much. Loads and loads of fun. If I could rate them individually I would give the original a 9 probably.

While it's odd to think that you can actually win against Cthulhu, it's a fun little strategy game that sometimes lasts for longer than it should.  The amount of table space required for the game is too much.  We joke that if we ever get the Dunwich Horror expansion, we'll need to push two pool tables together to play.  While the board and graphic design is just beautiful, the board should have been redesigned to allow neighborhood cards to be placed on the board.

Very cool stuff, from the components to the feel of the game.  It can take a long while, and there's a lot of randomness, so you could be winning and bad luck can take it away, but that makes the game all the more tense and exciting.

Fantasy Flight games seem to divide themselves over the years very distinctly into those that I really like and those that I really don't like; unfortunately Arkham Horror fell into the latter category after my first play, but I'm still willing to give it another shot to confirm, just as I gave Twilight Imperium two tries before deciding that it really wasn't for me. It's interesting because I really enjoy Descent: Journeys in the Dark, War of the Ring, Battlestar Galactica, and A Game of Thrones, but really can't stand TI3, Cosmic Encounter, and now Arkham Horror. I suppose this means I really need to try some of their other games that I'm skeptical about, but which could I suppose end up being favorites, such as StarCraft. I think the biggest hurdle to Arkham Horror for me is that I know absolutely nothing about the underlying subject matter and have absolutely no interest in that subject matter. Theme is not usually a major consideration for me, but when it comes to these sorts of epic games, I guess it's a different story, which explains why I like Battlestar Galactica, and Dune and War of the Ring for that matter. This is really cemented by my explanation here of my initial dislike of BSG before watching the television show, which seems to be a common experience. I think when it comes down to it, I'm happy to disregard the theme of a one hour game, but less inclined to do so for a three or four hour game. This seems like a good theory until you try to explain my love of Die Macher, which is simply inexplicable, but so very fantastic; who knew German elections could be so much fun.

I'm a sucker for flavor and this one had lots of it.  Plus, like a good video game, it's fun to build up your character with lots of cool items.  Long and fiddly but I still ended up playing five times in one weekend and couldn't wait to play again. Consequently I impulse bought it with both expansions.  The perfect game to play in between all those dry euros ;)

As long as one person really knows the rules well, the fiddly parts of the game aren't so bad for the rest of the players.  Also, make sure the players know they are in for a long game and tell them you will take care of all the hard parts.  Provided they like the theme and would enjoy wandering around reading cool encounters for four hours, they should have a blast.

Despite some issues, I don't remember the last time I had this much fun playing a game.

Played three times during my SIL and her husband's visit to the States.  He loved it and is now collecting games as well as turning his friends into boardgame zombies.

It is a fun game if a bit long to set up.  Have one expansion which I have yet to play.  Too many other games I want to play.

RATING: 9
Awsome game but not for everyone, some consider this a very complex game with poorly written rules, I however have had really no issues with the rules.  

I will addmit that there is alot going on in this game and alot to keep track of but with reading the rules quite a few times and after 4-5 games under your belt this should move smoothly, be prepared to invest about 2-4 hours of your time in a game of AH (at least for the first few times you play) 

The sweet spot for this game is 4-5 players ,with a few different ways to win this game after 5 or so games you will realize how to win this game more than not... then it will be time to look into getting a few expansions and learning some more rules.

Don't give up on this game so quickly, it is drenched in theme and a wonderful way to spend a few hours of your time.

A word of warning... if you end up enjoying the base game you will most likley want to aquire the expansions, with the expansions this game is a table hog, be prepared to play on the floor or buy a huge surface to play on.

Probably one of my most played 'big box' games of all times. I first played this game in 2006 when the DM of our Call of Cthulhu games recommended we play this when one of our players was sick. I was immediately hooked on the game and bought it the day after. Sure, the game has its flaws but I don't care. It perfectly encapsulates the Lovecraftian horror feel. 

Lots of people have jumped ship to Eldritch Horror, which I don't enjoy as much. Eldritch is a fun game but feels TOO slick and almost feels like a step down from Arkham, especially in difficulty. Sure, it fixes some things and streamlines the game but I think the clunkiness of Arkham HELPS the game's horror feel. 

I own all the expansions and we frequently play this game with a mix of expansion content thrown in. With well over 100 games played (probably a LOT more) I'm still enjoying Arkham just as much, if not more, as when I first played it.

RATING: 10
A flavorful and tense co-op game that sets players against a massive invasion of an ancient evil.  Very bits-intensive, but it is worth it for the overall experience.  It is also a bit long...

A lot of people have said that the rules have a lot of little "gotchas", but I've found it to be pretty intuitive.  The manual could use a little work, but overall I think it does a good job of explaining the core concepts and giving examples of gameplay.

As of now, my favorite co-op title.

**EDIT 8/19/2010 - Bumping my rating up to a 9 after a great solo session.  This game has crazy amounts of narrative, challenge, and variety.  I haven't even branched out from the base game, and I feel like I'm scratching the surface.

**EDIT 6/12/2011 - Bumping up to a 10.  Was there ever any doubt?  Sure, the length is enormous, but if you're going to play a game for that long, this is it.

The [b]best totally cooperative board game ever made[/b] (that I know of, and have played). Full of theme, tension and decisions, and not the decision making is not really pre-set, as in boards like Pandemic, where if you are de Medic, you MUST do this and do basically ONLY this for all the game.

In [b]Arkham Horror[/b] the player normally have several options all with their own merits. Really no two plays of AH are alike (I played over 100 times, and none were the same). It works even better if the players know the works of Lovecraft? Yes, it does, but it is not necessary or required. All you need is to want to work together (or solo) to experience a great game.

A warning tough: avoid at all costs to play this game with 6 or more people. If they are all crazy fans of the game (that say things like: "the best cooperativa game ever"), then you may consider. But, in 95% of the situations, it will translate into a poor (if not awful and/or hateful) experience: the downtime is huge and the game can easly surpass the 3 hours of game. And if one investigator gets lost in time and space? Go take a nap and be back in 30 minutes.

I like AH more than any other game, and I still say that the biggest mistake made is say that this game is for 1 to 8 players (consider 1 to 5 and be happy!).

RATING: 2
Rules: Unacceptable mess of inconsistency. Needs approximately 3 times the rulebook page count of errata and clarifications.

Game Length: eons of broken repetition.

Gameplay: Seriously flawed/broken (co-operative game with not a slightest hint for need of co-operation). Very, very, very repetitive.

Components: Average, most components non-purposeful. Way, way too much repetitive clutter.

Overall impression: Very limited re-playability, once to learn the system, second time to realize that there is nothing in it.

Any player having tendency to think will stall the game for hours to come. In this case, it is strongly recommended to have secondary game around to kill the downtime, something like ASL will do perfectly.

Has incredible immersion in the milieu, especially if you like Lovecraft. It feels small and a little claustrophobic. It's hard enough to create a challenge, without feeling that you can power game through it. The main negative is that it has a lot of pieces, with long set up time as well as a long playing time. Very enjoyable.

Difficult one to rate.  It is very much an "experience" game, it's quite fiddly, and it takes a while, so to say I'd frequently suggest it isn't true.

Given the right crowd, and time to enjoy it, it oozes atmosphere, and is an absolute blast.

I can appreciate the quality of the components and the depth that the game goes into Lovecraftian lore, but the game play is all to repetitive and the game doesn't seem to offer enough variation or option: move, fight, go in to portal, etc. Components and art work are awesome, mechanics are kind of blase and the game play, aside from the excitement of random dice rolls, just kind of lagged; this despite the group's enthusiasm during the play.

I'm pretty ambivalent about ever playing this game again. I'll play it, but the experience isn't that fun. I can see that there's a sophisticated design here and that all of the encounter decks can be heavily manipulated. But I also think it will take time to figure that out and that means a lot of games where I feel like I have no control. In the meantime, i won't be having much fun. Meh.

I had the fear that this would just be a big dicefest, but the flavour and the tactical options are good enough to make it work for me. Its suitability for solo play is also a big plus. In fact, it's better as a solo game than as a multi-player one.

I've played this twice now and consider it to be a very drawn-out and fiddly affair. The theme is also poorly implemented so I didn't really get the feeling of playing a character travelling around arkham at all.

update:  the newness wore off over the holidays.  i'd like to re-evaluate my previous statement:  I'll go ahead and lump this in with talisman and tales of the arabian nights.  its an experience game with no choices and too much randomness.  you are along for the ride...however dull that may be.

I very much like this game and play it with my own mixture of expansion elements. I don't like the injury cards which every man and his dog seem to think make the game so much better. They just get boring if I'm honest... I like to think about my strategies when I play a game, unfortunately Arkham doesn't scratch this itch. However it does manage to tell a story and I love using my imagination and seeing an almost "movie-like" story getting woven infront of me. Beautiful.

I have the following expansions for this one:
Dunwich Horror
Innsmouth Horror
Kingsport Horror
Miskatonic Horror
Black Goat of the Wooods
Curse of the Dark Pharaoh
King in Yellow
Lurker at the Threshold

This game is very good.  The theme is amazing as you really feel like your in the game and monsters are appearing from portals.  Very cool mechanics and dice rolling to either fight, evade, or close gates.  A rather difficult game, especially with only playing one player.  I have found that to even the solo play a little bit, is to use two player rules except you get two actions for every mythos card.  It works for an easier time to beat the game a few more times.  Using items, and spells and abilities is a must.

Way too many convoluted rules. You never really know if you're cheating/playing the game right. Mechanics feel tacked on and don't feel cohesive or intuitive. We were consulting the rule book every 5 minutes.

Too much downtime on turns. Especially if you're stuck in the other dimension or if your entire turn just consisted of moving, and then waiting 30 minutes or so for your turn again.

Wow, a huge and expanding co-operative effort in the Cthulu mythos of H.P.Lovecraft!  Everybody loves it, let's play! Still, it has SO MANY BITS and the rules are SO COMPLICATED it requires somebody really into the game to drive it.  Hard to teach unless you know all the details, and they keep coming out with MORE EXPANSIONS. PLEASE STOP!!! NO MORE!!! Maybe a little too card driven for my tastes. And, it's lllllooooonnnnngggg! You have to plan on some time for this one. (I own all the H.P. Lovecraft literature, both printed and digital.) No, besides all that, with the right people this game is a BLAST!

Only played once. Rating may increase with more play. Rating will probably increase with Curse of the Dark Pharaoh. Would be nice to see more Mythos cards that makes it more probable gates opening in stable locations. It would make the game flow better. An interesting thing that happened in our play was that when everything seemed to go well it suddenly turned and looked very dark. We won though. *** UPDATE: Changed the rating to a 8. This has been done to reflect the fun and interesting game it actually is. Not many hard decisions to make but fun nonetheless. Hopefully FFG will release an expansion incorporating the different expansions in a good way. Of course more expansion will be nice, would definately buy them. ***UPDATE: Decreasing rating from 8 to 6 after playing Eldritch Horror last night.

Only a few plays so far, but I know I like it. I like it so much that I'm a bit miffed that I purchased mine before the revised edition came out. It's too good a game to have the edition with the errors. That's why I have subsequently purchased the Dunwich Horror expansion (which contains corrected versions of the erroneous cards). The errors on the investigator sheets are trivial enough to remember.

Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!

RATING: 6
Ugh, Arkham.  One of my first introductions to playing 'against the game'.  For helping popularize that concept, Arkham deserves a good score.  The game itself, though, is as shaky as someone who's just seen Shub-Niggurath.

This monster (the moster-sized game, not the Old Ones.. :P) will eat your entire table for five hours as you stumble around, wandering into gates because you have to, and hoping not to get too badly altered by the events that transpire while you're in otherworldly places.

There are RPG elements, with Lore and Luck as interesting slider attributes, along with the entire slider mechanic.  Different characters have different abilities and are more suited to one thing or another.  Places on the map have flavors in the cards they can produce...

Except.. none of it really matters.  Whether you get tossed on your ear or discover some shattering insight at the Miskatonic University comes down to what card was on top.  Whether you get lost in time and space or have a day as uneventful as a trip to the mall when you go literally out-of-this world is .. dependent on which card was on top.  Your character's special ability is basically irrelevant.  Your success or failure is not something you can see the grand strategy of.  

Yes, vaguely you can see that killing this or that monster keeps them from overflowing, or perhaps they're just in the way.  Or maybe you think you'll trade their heads for some useful gear before a shop closes.  Ultimately, though, there isn't a feeling of progression the way there in in, say, Pandemic, nor a feeling of tension, despite the fact that you're more likely to lose Arkham than many other coop games and that that will represent a much larger chunk of time invested.

Ultimately, this creaks and groans its way through hours of play, turns seeming interminable when it's not your turn (unless you devolve to Play-by-Committee) at which point your participation might be made moot anyway.

I love this world so much.  This game is just wonderful, though a bit clunky.  I love the board and the characters and the locations and the monsters.  I get this nostalgic feeling every time I play it.  It takes a really long time to play but I feel it's worth it.  People say Eldritch Horror has replaced it.  I haven't played that yet but after watching a couple of playthroughs I don't think it would for me.  I would miss the city too much.  For me the game is far more about the story of Arkham itself than the game play so the whole globe-trotting thing doesn't appeal to me as much.  That being said I would probably like Eldritch, I just don't think it would replace Arkham for me.

This sat glaring at us off the shelf for several months as it wallowed in its reputation for being a long and fearsomely complex game. We decided we were going to need a good long weekend to play it.

A wonderful mess of a game that is a bit too turgid, slow, and with too many rules exceptions.

I have some friends for whom it is "the game", that one big, somewhat messy game that struck a chord and which turned them into gamers.  Playing with them, it's a fun experience game; otherwise, I'll pass.

Eldritch Horror, imo, is much cleaner, faster, and better, save for its random gate system.

RATING: 9.8
Things I liked about this game: Excellent components. Truely a visual stunner. The background story and theme of the game are captured in every piece of the game. The monster movement system is excellent and really captures a the feel of monsters roaming the streets unpredictably (which was a concern when I heard about how the game works). There are loads of encounters and for the most part they really pull you deeper into the game and keep your interest through out. I found that with every card came greater anticipation of what was lurking in the next turn. I also thought the characters were well put together and thier backgrounds were represented well in thier effects on the game. I will say that some are far better than others in the overall outcome of the game. That can be percieved as an added challenge to game play, or an easy elimination for character choices. I also really liked the towns "Terror Tracker" and the adverse effects on the game if monsters are not dealt with. 

What I didn't like: The game may take longer than the average gamer can commit to often. I am not sure I can spend 5 hours playing a game all that much. It was fun, but it really takes a long time to finish a game. I also felt (and this is pretty petty) that you should have gotten more dice than just 5, as many rolls used 7-10 dice. I also would recommend that anyone who is learning this game with out another person who has played a few games read through the rule book more than once and have everything layed out, as the rule book can be a little difficult to refer back to for specific Q&A. 

With that in mind, I really feel that if this game could be finished on average within 2 hours that I would have rated it 9. And for those of you who are married and want to game with your wife, my advice would be to read through the rules a couple times first (as this will keep the game moving and not burn time referencing in the rule book). My wife is not a gamer, but I took a friends advice and did just that, and 5 1/2 hours later she wants to play again. I feel that is the strongest aspect of this game, is it's ability to entertain a broad audience. It is involved, yes. But with a good understanding of the rules you can introduce casual gamers to a fun, interactive game that will have everyone laughing and working together to close just one more gate...........Buy it! It is worth the investment. 

Thanks to everyone who posted feedback. I bought this game due to your posts!

RATING: 6.75
Well-designed for what it is, but what it is isn't necessarily what I usually want from a game.  If I spend several turns acquiring the necessary clue tokens, and then move to a gate, and then spend two turns in that other world, I want that gate to close when I come out of it.  I don't want to fail the roll and have to go back into the other world for two more turns and try again.

It's the kind of randomness I don't usually like.  There are ways to mitigate it, but not to the degree I personally prefer. (Cf., for example, Blood Bowl, which has a high degree of randomness but is, to a degree, about using good strategy to mitigate that randomness and bend it to your will.)

But that's me, and YMMV.  Certainly it's fun with the right crowd.

RATING: 9.5
Less a game and more of a story telling experience, there's nothing quite like Arkham Horror. Long, fiddly, random, it feels like you have little control and the game is playing you... all of the criticisms are justified; they're also why I love it.

RATING: 6.5
I really like the theme here, its rich and full of good stuff that adds to the gameplay. Game takes a while to play, atleast with new players. And its pretty "fiddly" in terms of all the components, some might not like that but I dont mind. It has its share of micromanaging your character and remembering of stats.
On the downside this one takes ages to set up, and in my opinion its a bit too long and slow.

This must be the epitomal Ameritrash game ... Fiddly to the Nth degree, lopsided chance of winning, takes so long to play sometimes that it ceases to be even remotely fun. But it looks great and captures Lovecraft perfectly. I liked the old, and I like this one even better for that reason.

I have always been a big fan of the original game by Chaosium.  I was concerned when I heard the FFG was going to be releasing it.   I was blown away when I saw it at Origins when it was released.  I played it numerous times that weekend.  One nice thing about this game is that length of time to play can be reduced by selecting the appropriate Great Old One.

At first I was displeased by its high price but I wanted to support the store. After more than 6 months from the initial purchase I have to admit that it is the best game I have ever played, I feel that the money I payed although a lot higher are well worth it. It is a jewel in my collection, I became a fan of Lovecraft after playing this game.

Still i have a lot of fun playing it.. i give it a 6 in the rating not because it´s bad or something, just because it´s not very playable by most gamers.

My wife and I got this game from Barnes and Noble.  I spent the first day just trying to learn the rules on my own (I'm the more experienced gamer).  To start, the rulebook was over 20 pages and did not lend itself to quick or easy set-up and play.  By the time I had the game set-up, my wife said she was bored and didn't want to play.

I continued to setup the game, determined to play on my own.  After about a dozen rounds, I agreed with my wife and put the game away.  The biggest issue with the game are the amount of rules, many of them only trigger in certain circumstances.  For example, each turn, all monsters with a symbol that matches a drawn card move or attack.  Sounds easy right?  Unless the border of the monster's token is red, in which case it moves twice, or yellow in which case it doesn't move, or blue in which case it moves to the closest outdoor player (or a holding area called the sky if no players are outdoors), or green in which the movement follows rules unique to the monster, or purple which case the monster can jump to an investigator under certain conditions or orange which can jump between aquatic locations if it is in an aquatic location and a player is in a different aquatic location.

Those are the rules that need to be remembered for one quarter of one phase.  Most of the rest of the game is handled the same way.  You spend more time looking up what a purple border meant then actually forming strategies and actively playing the game.   Its just not fun.

The 11 year old picked it up very well when it was explained turn by turn/action by action to him for the first game, but if i had left him alone with the rule book or even now if he attempted to play on his own after 3 or 4 previous games he would be very lost. We have fun with this one as it is atmospheric and interesting but it lasts a very long time and it can get a bit repetative after 3 or 4 consequtive plays.  The more people on your side the easier it seems to be but it is still avery good solo game even though it is really very hard to win.overall we like this v.much

One of the better co-op games I played. Tons of options each round, great atmosphere and brilliant components. My first play took 6.5 hours with four players, but the game was never boring. The only thing I am concerned about is its replayability. The available expansions (which I will rate separately), however, should fix this. The expansions should also fix the fact that the game is a little too easy for four players. Finally, I have to admit that it took quite some effort for experienced gamers to get all the rules straight. Be prepared to read some extensive FAQs and posts during your first play in order to resolve specific situations.

I played Arkham Horror at Origins 05.  Despite significant differences, at it's heart, it feels alot like Runebound.  The differences are in the details, but the details matter.  This seems like a better game than 1st edition Runebound.  It is nice being able to adjust your character, and it's really nice that the monsters and tasks constantly refresh.

A nice piece of Ameritrash, a genre which is not typically my cup of tea. Fun theme, good bits, good variety in the characters, encounters, and enemies. Bonus points for being cooperative, though there have been more co-op games released since this one appeared. But ultimately I think the game drags on longer than it deserves to, particularly since the tension usually decreases as the game progresses. Though not cooperative, I find myself reaching more often for Runebound than AH when I'm in the mood for this sort of thing.

Our favourite game and we've played it a lot (2 player), way before I started recording plays. Great atmosphere and there's a real sense of unfolding story. It's a totally absorbing experience that is really FUN! 
Expansions just keep this one going. Only down side is the time it takes to play, which means we can't play as often as we'd like. But then I guess it keeps it fresh!

This is the first game I bought, when my new found love for board games began... This is one of our (wife & my) favorite games.  We have played it several times and enjoy the massive amounts of options in gameplay, in terms of characters, ancient ones, and locales to visit/explore as the adventure unfolds.  I also like the fact that losing happens just as often as winning.  Leaves us wanting to go back in and kick the Ancient One back into the dark aeons from which it came.  This game is slanted to reflect the desperate environment of H.P. Lovecraft's world.  As one of my gamer friends put it, the game can often feel like "upper cut, nut punch, upper cut..." as the cards unfold and enemies populate the board.

Only 1 play.  I understand all of the reasons why everyone likes this one, but it seems like cooperative games are not for me, and this one is no different.

A couple of years ago I would have given Arkham Horror a 10. Every game tells a fantastic story and, if you play with a bunch of hardened Call of Cthulhu role players like I do, the experience is exceptional. Unfortunately my patience for mammoth game sessions has waned over the years - set up time alone (if you're adding some expansion material) takes longer than many good games. Added to that is the real possibility of the game ending in failure and, unless you're careful, of an alpha player taking over the entire play. 
Yup, AH with it's hundreds of tiny cards and counters littering the gaming table like an explosion in a confetti factory is starting to show its age - an age where the BGG landscape shook to the tread of the coffinboxes.
I still have a soft spot for the old tyrannosaurus though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastic cooperative board game, though extremely long.  Can drag if you happen to play a character who gets stuck, which is why we usually play with multiple characters when doing 4 or less players.

These days I prefer Eldritch Horror, which is Arkham horror, but faster, simpler to set up, and removes all the annoying elements while still retaining everything that makes this game wonderful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like Arkham Horror. It has great mood and is an expansive experience. The cooperative tilt limits my appreciation of it just a bit. The 'lead player' conundrum can rear its ugly head pretty easily with some players doing the fun battling of the monsters while other players can be knocked out or just relegated to minor status.

RATING: 6
We always try with one character each for two players, in any game. This one seems clear you need four investigators minimum. While more players does increase spawn, it gives you more investigators-worth of movement and battle action before the Arkham/Other World phase encounters (which may, themselves, spawn more monsters) and the Mythos phase (which ain't nevah good). 

We quit after 8 hours, eight closed gates, three sealed, and still four open gates (at the time) away from any sort of victory. I was getting grumpy and bored, and we already dedicated an extra day of Shametember to it and couldn't spare another anyway. We don't have a game table vault to put it away, so it sits in the middle of our living room taking up our only gaming space so long as it is set up. To make room for other games, it had to go.

In related news, I referenced multiple forum discussions on commonly misunderstood/missed rules, and the only one-and-a-half we were getting wrong were ones that would have helped us rather than made the game harder, so the fact that with two investigators we lasted that long (and maybe even could have won? We were only 5/10 on the Doom track when we quit)...I think we did pretty good. Verdict: Chris liked it and wants to play again soon. I felt it had some needlessly fiddly bits (in the battles particularly) and needlessly hard bits, some of which the creator of the game even wrote a PDF of house rules he uses/recommends now even addresses. Overall I enjoyed many elements of it; and the turn order/flow, once we grokked it, is pretty good for a game of this scale.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
Based on 1st Play - Themed perfectly gives you a real feel of being in the action.  Frustrations Move-Combat-Encounter and all the phase before and after. Plus the seven hours it took to complete our first game.  That and just having a miserable time with the randomness.  It'll probably go up after a couple more plays but still.

My only exposure to this was an eight hour game that went on for too long to  too little effect. Nonetheless, I'm upping my rating, as I would gladly play this again with four or less players. There's more ride than game in it, but I can imagine it running quite smoothly once everyone is down with the rules. Could do with a "Shadows of Camelot" type traitor mechanic.

RATING: 4
Not a strategy game. Bloated rules, long but without any real progression in gameplay. Being presented with one obvious choice and 50+ clearly suboptimal choices does not make for an interesting game. Repeating this experience continually for more than 4 hours is just unnecessary.

The theme elements and rules bloat do provide a sense of discovery during the first couple of playthroughs that is quite satisfying. But once these are understood there is no game left.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely more of an experiential co-op (play for the sake of having cool stories and fun moments rather than for balance/stressful decisions). That being said, it's just really long, and I think I'd rather play BSG if we really wanted a thematic long experience. If it could be condensed into a Pandemic-length game, I'd be a lot more eager.

Very fun co-op game. 

Update: I started out really liking this game but have found it's faults. Something needs to be done about making it a little easier to win by sealing/closing gates and make battling the ancient one harder. While this was somewhat fixed with the Dunwich expansion, it also broke some other things. The spells also make me groan, spells just aren't worth using except for the ones that don't cost any sanity. Still fun but down from an 8 to a 7.

Update #2: This game is back up to an 8. I've started playing it again without the Dunwich expansion and it is a MUCH better game without that expansion. The DH expansion just adds a bunch of junk that makes the game harder and more tedious. More detail in the DH entry.

Update #3: It's been 2 years since I've played this. I'm now scaling it back from an 8 to a 5. This game is so frustrating, it seems like you're always getting punished. Sometimes when you succeed you still get punished. It's like you have an alcoholic father who beats your ass when you manage to only score 3 touchdowns in a state playoff game. You really feel helpless and it seems like there's not a lot of planning you can do. 
     
It's also not a lot of fun to watch your character get weaker and weaker as the game goes on. I suppose this is supposed to make it feel like you're playing out one of Lovecraft's stories, struggling to keep your sanity as you strive to stave off the ancient one, but this argument is moot when the easiest way to victory is to just duke it out with the ancient one.
    
My last complaint is the spells. Ugh, wtf? Sanity is used in a lot of the tests during the game, but then if you want to use spells you have to spend more of that precision resource. Even then it's not guaranteed you're going to get the benefits of the spell. I mean really, how much sense does this make? The melee attacks don't use health so why do the spells use sanity? 
   
The best bet is to just lay low, collect the easy stuff if you can, and then wait for the ancient one to come calling. I guess that's how you're supposed to play it, but does that really sound appealing? Not to me. Overall, I think the developers struggled with trying to balance the game and tie it into the mythos. Unfortunately, they failed. I'm giving it a 4 and I feel I'm being generous giving it that high of a rating.

Update #4: After looking over how I've rated some other games I'm dropping it to a 3. Strange, I just cracked a malicious grin...

A tough, cooperative survival game set in Lovecraft's Arkham city. Rules for combat and movement are a little clunky, but the sense of victory from successfully completing a game is tough to beat. Player death is a real possibility, and is a bit of a bummer if you get knocked out of the game while other players are still in. Gorgeous art and the theme can't be beat. Improved upon in many ways by Eldritch Horror.

Arkham Horror is an amazing game.  Before it, I was only familiar with board games by Milton-Bradley and similar ilk.  I had no idea a game could be like this.

The amount of support and expansion, both professional and fan, only make a great experience better.

Lots of fun.  Great atmosphere.  I love the sense of tension that this creates and you try to keep your head above water.  Pretty well balanced.  

The two knocks against it:  can drag with a lot of players, and I am afraid it may get stale after more than a few plays.  (Of course that's what expansions are for.)

Haven't logged all of my plays for most of my games, but this is the most under-logged; probably missing hundreds of plays.  As you might be able to tell, this game never gets tired for me.  With all of the expansions, the game is so different from play to play, and the different investigators change the experience so much, that it's tough to see how this game could ever get boring or repetitive. 

Having played enough, the game is currently at an average play time of ~2.5 hours for our usual game group, including set up time.

I love the world of Lovecraft, but I generally dislike playing 2 hours into a foregone conclusion. 

Even though Arkham Horror is a co-op game, and the players won both times I've played, the victory seemed unimpressive, because very few players were actually able to contribute to the war effort.

I find it a little odd that physically strong characters are allowed to close gates, because this renders most of the intellectuals redundant. Slap a gun on the detective, and watch him handle pretty much everything, while the other players grab the odd elder sign every few turns or so.

This seems to be a recurring theme in the Fantasy Flight games.

:star::star::star::nostar:

For me, [thing=146021]Arkham Horror v3[/thing] is a strict upgrade over [thing=15987]Arkham Horror v2[/thing]. I can certainly see the appeal of v2, especially for those with a lot of experience and/or cash invested. But with a couple plays of v2 and a couple plays of v3, I'm all in on Eldritch Horror.

First, it allows me to play solo with fewer characters. If I wanted to fiddle with that many characters at once, I'd be playing [thing=91872][/thing] or [thing=92190][/thing]. 

Second, I love the streamlining of EH. If I wanted to deal with that much overhead, I'd be playing [thing=96848][/thing] [-]or [thing=121921][/thing][/-]. 

Third, it gives a stronger set of goals that feels like a better alignment between "what I should be doing" and "what I feel like I should be doing." If I wanted to do that much shopping, I'd be playing [thing=35002][/thing].

Great coop dice rolling. Nice use of theme. Components are lovely.

The problem with this game for me is that it is nominally a cooperative game, but it feels much more like everyone is working on their own solo project. For an exciting cooperative game, I find Shadows, Fury of Dracula, Lord of the Rings, or especially Battlestar Galactica to fit the bill much better. There also seems to be needless complexity with all the pieces, decks of cards, etc. Revised edition.

I gave this another try at Origins 2014 and it was as disappointing (and BORING!) as ever. I don't understand how a horror game can be this tedious.

Fun and balanced game.  Sometimes you play well, other times you don't.  The game offers an ever changing world and endless possibilities.  Downside - it can take a long time to play a game and can be very rule heavy.  Recommend playing it and with the right group can be a very rewarding experience even if you lose.  Co-op games are not very common and this one is really one where you need to be able to work together.

We enjoy this.  Seems like role playing in a board game, which is no surprise given its lineage.  We haven't done much role playing lately.

We'll probably get at least one expansion.  Not for everyone, not much strategy.  I don't mean that it a bad way, but the game plays you rather than the other way around.  Plans might not last long.  Good atmosphere.

There currently seems to be a "not quite as fun" hump in the middle of the game.  Here's to hoping that goes away with more plays.

Ok, the rating has gone up to an 8 from 7.  While we'd rather play with 4 real players, the 2+2 is quite enjoyable.  The game is still a serious time commitment but we usually plan on a food break sometime in the middle which really helps.

We're still not completely on top of all the rules.  We know them but still look up quite a bit just to make sure.

Now the rating has risen to 9.  I think when we chose Arkham Horror over weeding the garden (needed to be done)....   I guess we just like getting beat up for hours.  "The Camellot 'terror level' was at 9 so the garden was closed."  That's our story and we're stickin' to it.

We haven't played this in a while, mainly because of the time commitment.  There's been a marked move towards euros lately.

[i]"Very poor. Annoying, I plan to never play this again."[/i]

Very long, very random, half the theme is flavour text about an old man staring at you, would be quarterbackable if any of your decisions made the slightest bit of difference.

A game that cares this little about the mechanical experience has to [i]say[/i] something, and all Arkham Horror seems to say is "hope you irrationally love anything with Cthulhu in it".

RATING: 7
It does a great job at capturing the feel of a Lovecraftian tale, and it's a great co-op game; somewhat tough, but fair. Like a lot of Fantasy Flight games, it suffers from some balance issues that expansions have tried to fix, but not always successfully; this game could have used some extra playtesting. I've played it a lot, and I love it, but now I'm kinda over it.

YES, it's MASSIVE.  and YES, it takes time to set up.  and YES, the card draw and dice leave a lot up to chance.  However, the game is almost always intriguing (win or lose) and at times is downright amazing.  Thematically it is magnificent.  Far more intimate and darker than the globe trotting Eldritch.  

Huge fan.

One play, 5 people, base set only.  I'm very glad to have had the chance to play this, after several years of seeing it being played.  On the basis of that one game I won't rush to do it again - it was too long, too fiddly and the mechanics got in the way of the theme.  However, I recognise I might like it more on another occasion, maybe with 4 people only, and for once, dice that don't hate me ;)

RATING: 9
Wonderfully thematic. The constant sense of doom doesn't leave until the game is over. The rules are quite a handful, however, but only one person needs to know them. Even though every time I've played I've been killed, gone insane, been lost in time and space and trapped inside by riots, I've had tonnes of fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game that gets worse the more you play it!

The good: Thematic lovecraft fun. The art is great. Tons of components. RPG experience without a DM. Combat works out pretty well.

The bad: Essentially broken. Sneak is completely useless since it can only be used while moving, and in order to use it effectively you have to stop moving. Encounters are random and there is no meaningful way to prepare for them. Impossible with 2 people, Incredibly easy with 4-6. 2 hours longer then it should be. Spells don't offer any unique or powerful benefits yet punish you severely for using (or trying to use) them.

I play this with a friend who is REALLY enthusiastic about it. Unfortunately having it brought to the table so much has killed it for me.

It's not a wargame, but its also not Monopoly.  There are alot of high quality components in this game (cards, counters and a larger than normal game map!).

I know there are a lot of people out there who absolutely love this game.  Good for them, I am glad they found something they enjoy.  In fact, I think this is probably the best co-op game out there.  I think the mechanics and theme are very well constructed so that you feel like you are one of a team of investigators trying to stop a horrible outcome.. to a point.  Maybe its not the theme and mechanics I have a problem with.  Maybe its just the whole Lovecraftian vibe that I just can't get into.  I mean, I respect it as much as any other made up lore for its complexity and detail, but its just not my cup of tea.  Plus, the game seems overly complicated.  I agree with those who say that its complexity helps to draw you into the theme.  I also agree with those who say that the game is enjoyed more when you do understand the mechanics.  I am simply saying that the game is very complicated, especially if you did not have someone around who has played the game before.  If the downloaded flowcharts for the game are 6 pages long, then the game is too complicated. I have learned alone and taught many games, but this one was a chore.   Perhaps there will come a day when I will request Arkham Horror be pulled off the shelf, but today is not that day.

A very involving coop game in the world of Lovecraft. Players go against the game trying to prevent the otherworldly creatures and various events from letting the Great Old Ones coming into our world.

Arkham Horror is a fun, flavorful game, but the length of play and density of the mechanics can make it a little difficult to find players consistently. You have to be in the right mood for this one, but when you are, and when you have the right group, it's very satisfying. That is however, a lot of conditions for fun in my opinion.

RATING: 4
I want to like this game, but I don't enjoy playing it at all.  The theme is pretty neat, or at least the idea of the theme is neat.  The cards and writing are solid and treat the Lovecraft mythos well.  But the overall feel is lost in the rather boring mechanics and disjointed experience.  The cooperative nature of the game doesn't have as much back-and-forth as in other co-op games, so the collaborative nature is lost.  As far as I'm concerned, [gameid=83330] gives me everything I want from this game, only with better narrative cohesion and more interesting decisions.

Had some fun elements, but waaaay too long. All 5 games we've played were over 6 hours each, and it wasn't because we were checking rules all game long. We knew what to do at each stage, but it just takes time to adjust things, draw and evaluate cards, talk about strategies, move monsters, etc.

Sold like a hot potato the moment Elder Sign was released. Just as much dicey goodness, but in an hour instead.

RATING: N/A
Luca Iennaco say:

Sort of multiplayer gamebook (or simple RPG with an automated Master).
Theme is nicely implemented. Some efforts to "roleplay" (when possible) improve the experience.
A bit of strategy and tactic is possible, but luck has a decisive role (cards and dice rolls).
Cards and characters aren't too well balanced.
Rules have some ambiguities and missing points; you'll have to fill the gaps and add some house rules to make the game playable (download the latest FAQs as well, since they're finally available).
It doesn't scale very well: too easy with more than 4 characters (and a lot of downtime) and too difficult with only one or two (we suggest: when playing solo, use 3 or 4 characters; with two players, use 2 characters each). I won't play it again with more than 4 players.
Game lenght was significant, but is reduced to about 2 hours (with up to 4 players) after some games. 
It becomes repetitive (similar gameplay and too few cards). Expansions alleviate this problem.
Fine components.

Overall, it is an EXPERIENCE the first time(s) and you MUST modify it to make it a decent GAME (my rating regards the game after you find a suitable set of global rules; it'd get only a "4" considering the game "as it is out of the box").

RATING: 8
Rated after 17 confirmed games with different groups. The game itself is good (at least thematically) and it is nice to play. The rule book on the other hand is poor, and it's quite difficult really understand the rules or check some details. Despite the theme, the rule book is the most terrifying thing in this game. Checking the rules (when playing every now and then) is very painful.

I have not played much co-op games, but they are nicely different than regular games, not competing against others but against the board.

There are lots of little chits and cards and other stuff. They look good, but there are millions of rules to remember - and did I already said, that the rule book is not good? The problem grows with expansions, which add new cards, new decks and new rules. Still, with a proper group and rules in your head, the game is good.

Update after 14th play: The amount of decks and cards is not the biggest problem, there are just so many tracks to update and things to remember, special abilities of monsters, old ones, investigators etc, that you either need to be very careful or have a good player aid, if you want to have a smooth game.

The 15th game was a solo game with two investigators, I just wanted to play the game and be able to check all the rules and twists without hurry.

One play with just the base game (basically) and although it was over a year since the last play, it went quite well. There are not that many things to worry about in the base game, but of course there are so many small rules and modifiers, that it is hard to remember them all. Fortunately, that is not always necessary, it all rounds up in the end anyway. :)

The latest game was with expansion, but not with the Dunwich board, which seems to be quite boring - at least with 4 or less players.

Arkham Horror is a great game, but the problem is, it's not so easy to find players for it. The level of complexity, the time it takes, the setup... It has a tendency to scare people of. If you can find a dedicated group for it - you will enjoy it all the way. If you can't, it might still be worth it! The game plays great solo, and if you get to put it one the table with other players from time to time, it's one of the best adventure games out there. I would still say "try it before you buy it", these days even "try both this and Eldtrich Horror before you buy anything".

This game is awesome!  It is rich in theme and fun to play.  One drawback is how long it takes, I've only played 1 and 2 player games and they both seem to take at least an hour and a half.

Once you get used to the turn patterns it gets easier to play but I still have to reference the rulebook every now and then.

A richly themed game with good Mythos content that lends itself well to roleplay. Game can seem overwhelming at first but after a few plays you can get to grips with the admin and turn sequence. Although games tend to revolve around sealing gates as the best option to win, i would say there is enough detail for the casual player to get plenty out the game given the varied characters and ancient ones.

UPDATE: Triple fired by Pathfinder (take card, see what happens, but miles quicker), Elder Sign (roll dice, see what happens with Lovecraft theme) and Zombicide (silly thematic coop)

UPDATE: Fired by Mage Knight as our epic wandering around a board game.

The closest you can get to exploring a haunted town plagued by tentacled horrors without... Erm, exploring a town plagued by horrors.

Becomes more varied, interesting (and harder) with expansions, but not noticeably longer. 

The only downsides are table space needed, setup time and play time. For this reason, it doesn't get played that often.

Fun with two players if you play two or three investigators each.

I love this game, though it can drag on and on with my gaming group. It's hard, so winning feels like a real accomplishment.

However, this game is soul crushingly hard, so you have to be the sort who can handle losing frequently.

An excellent game. The downside is that it has SO MUCH material and details that is very difficult to put everything together and play correctly. If you have a group that can dedicate hours to it, then grab a copy!

EDIT: After some time without this game, and after playing other games, I can realise that this game is a double-edged sword.

In one side, it is imense! Seriously, it has tons of material in the main box alone. If you add the expansions, you'll be probably swimming in chits and pieces.

The downside is that this game NEEDS commitment. When playing this, you must act like you were going for a RPG session, where you'll spende some hours to play.

RATING: 6
Neat ideas, interesting mechanics, and a great theme.  The game takes about 2 hours too long for what I get out of it, and the mid-game seems to get terribly drawn out as people wander around, waiting for something interesting to do, but dammit, it's a whole heck of a lot of fun.  I like the way that the game handles die rolls (instead of modifying the die result with different bonuses, you modify the NUMBER of dice you roll, with the winning results never changing), but it means that there's still no guarantee that you're going to get what you need at the right time.  Still, a game with a Cthulhu theme should contain no minimum of chaos, so it works.  If I could play it within about 2 hours, I'd probably like it even more.

The classic adventure game inspired by 19th century horror writers (Lovecraft, Chambers, Manchen,et al.). Nothing short of amazing. Fiddly is a good thing - anyone who says otherwise is lazy.

RATING: 10
I love cooperative games and I love RPG-like games. These two aspects transform playing the game into a social event, so I don't mind that the session length is definitely on the long side. It's fun to sit around the table with my friends and weave additional story stuff around the things that happen on the board.

To avoid long waiting times, that suck the flow out of the game, I would not play it with more than four players.

RATING: 7
If you play Arkham Horror digitally, such as on Tabletop Simulator, it is an 8. If you play it physically, it's a 7 at best. The meandering pace brought on by the excessive token-card flipping/management/movement brings the game down to a halt once a turn. In digital form it's significantly more manageable and makes for a more fun overall experience, certainly if you're talking with friends over the internet at the same time.

Great Thematic Game. Light a few candles, put on some atmospheric music or sound-scape, and turn off the lights. A favourite to play when the power goes out. Rating has gone down a bit as Eldritch Horror has supplanted it from our game table.

We played with six, and it felt a bit too easy and a bit too limited. I suspect that a game with four is going to be much more interesting -- each player is going to get a wider role to play and more opportunity to explore the game's chrome while preparing to fight off what the game has to throw at them. It's not yet clear to me how much of the chrome has actual purpose, and much is just pointless tacked-on detail.

Excellent.  Plays very well solo.  Really has a great feel to the theme.  Loads of fun.  Seems to get a bit easier the more often you play it, but it's still a blast.

Some of the cards seem to be a bit too powerful (some of the Rumors in particular) and there's quite a few things to keep track of, but that's not a big issue.  And then there's those stupid bloody unbendable plastic stands for the pieces.

The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.
\13\ \13\
Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.
\13\ \13\ 
Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror. Will they Prevail? 
\13\ \13\ 
Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!

This is my first exposure to the Cthulu mythos, and it turned out to be a highly interactive game.  People seemed interested in everything happening in the game.  The rules are a bit dense, but the manual could be laid out a little better.  No ambiguities!  I strongly recommend that you use a player aid to reduce the amount of rules page flipping. The game took about five hours to play the first time, with about an hour to go over rules and set it up.  The tension was high starting out, but seemed to go smoothly once we got into it.

its a very nice adventure game, very atmospheric, after my first few games of this I wasnt sure what to think of it but I'm definitely starting to warm to it. I think that when you play this game you have to try and roleplay a little bit and try and get into the spirit of things, and just enjoy it, win or lose.
I feel that people should tweak the rules from game to game and try different things out, i've yet to lose to this game except in solitare though, despite 4x2 player games, although 2 of them have been very close affairs. All in all a game that has risen in my estimation but probably not one for the harcore abstract strategy gamer.

RATING: 5
Have you ever played this game with 5 or 6 players? It's hell on Earth, and one of the worst possible games I can think of for that player size. 

The game also got old fast for me, even with more manageable player numbers. It is just too easy, and once you understand the rules it becomes bleedingly obvious that you should just never ever close a portal, and to have at least one guy just camp forever at the newspaper. The result is pretty monotonous.

But man, is this game fun and scary before the novelty wears off. I also love the idea of playing against the board rather than against each other - it lets me play competitively without having to worry about stepping on anyone's toes.

Anyway, I'm told the expansions add a lot to the game, which is why the rating is still pretty high, despite the fact that I would never touch the base game again if I had my way. My hopes are that when I get around to getting an expansion, the game will be revived for me. 

EDIT: The expansions helped, but caused game length to balloon to ridiculous amounts. I've moved on and regret all of the purchases I did for this, trying to get it to a playable state.

This game nails its theme like no other. The monsters hunt you, the events constantly thwart your best laid plans, and sometimes just for fun, an Elder God devours you.

Awesome.

As for how it plays, it requires quite a bit of maintenance on the part of the players. There are a million things going on every Mythos phase (which happens every turn) and it can be a challenge to keep track of it all. That being said, all the upkeep results in a fantastic adventure for the players. The game challenges and fights them every step of the way, delivering a very fulfilling experience. The A.I. of the game is really just a large deck of cards that spits out random effects, but it is eerily effective in making the players feel hunted, adding tension and drama to every flip of the Mythos deck.

Make no mistake, Arkham Horror is a light RPG for those of us who don't role play and the group it is played with certainly makes or breaks the game. If everyone at the table gets into their characters, drops funny dialogue and expounds upon the text delivered in the encounter decks, then the fun level goes through the roof. Without this, it is a dull game of random token shuffling. Fortunately for me, my group really enjoys getting into the story and we often joke about the various ways our characters have been devoured or lost in time and space...often for weeks afterwards. Maybe it's even less of a game and more of an experience, but either way, it's a good one!

I've played the crap out of this game and own almost all of the expansions. Now that I've played the game a bunch and seen all there is too see, it is often difficult to get the group fired up to play this game again, given the amount of bits and fiddling that goes into playing. But when I do get a group fired up to play, it is still loads of fun when you get into the right mindset. It's pretty telling that even all these years later I still go back and play every now and then.

This is probably my favorite horror game (though Fury of Dracula is also high on the list) and probably my favorite coop game (though Pandemic is also high on that list). Either way I really enjoy this one. The theme is so rich it's like an RPG. Don't let this one intimidate you, it can be learned and doesn't take all day to play. Very difficult solo if you draw random Investigators and random Ancient Ones.

RATING: 8
We have the base game and all the expansions. This is a great game for 3 or more players. Set up takes a while and there are many small pieces, but once the game gets going, it really draws the players into the world of Lovecraft's mythos and the 2-fisted 20's.The horror is often "humor" ... especially with some of the random encounters. Only a couple drawbacks are evident: the cash and allies are rare to come by. The nature of the game and the mechanics makes earning money and buying stuff a luxury. The cardboard figures... plastic miniatures would have been nice, considering that everything else is made of paper.

Since i discovered Lovecraft eons ago, Cthulhu and particularly Nyarlathotep are tattooed on my heart, this game has a very special place among my collection.

Not to forget that it's one of the best cooperative game made so far. A must for all Lovecraftian worshipper like myself.

Your not forced to play with all the expansions but using a little bit of everything makes the game different each time.

One of my top favorite games to play in solo

There are problems: too long (but not that bad with < 4), wildly varying balance from game to game, obvious cruft from development (monster limits, outskirts, and terror leap out), really poor scaling. But most annoying is the weird front-loaded arc where you're under massive siege at first and then you coast toward the end; this is a fundamental failure of the designers to understand how gates and doom really interact. All this, along with focus sliders and monsters, seems cool at first, but breaks down under scrutiny.

Expansion integration is questionable at best. Seems clearly designed to play with one big + one small, no more. Beyond that it gets fragmented, both in terms of too much ground to cover/too few actions, and that of game effects that become too diluted to produce enough tension. Again, the fundamental failure is the gate/doom interaction, and their patches (spread out the board and/or undo gate seals) are both wrong-headed.

In the end, this has to be approached as a fun adventure game, and it does manage to create a convincing atmosphere, while still offering some crunchy bits in terms of decisions. But it's one of those paradoxical games, where if you play to win, it's either trivially solvable or it loses all thematic coherence (gear up and take down the big bad; about as anti-HPL as you can get). So you have to truly "play" to enjoy it, and I've done that many enjoyable times with my daughters, and I'll never sell it due to the warm nostalgia.

But it's fading, and Eldritch renders it more and more obsolete, as EH is just a flat out better game design.

Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh on ol' Arkham Horror, but I've just been completely underwhelmed all three times I've played it.  There's just soooo much compounded randomness that, for the time investment, it ends up feeling kind of pointless.  Maybe if I was more invested in the theme or more familiar with the (many, many, many) decks of cards, it would click a bit better.

There are several individual mechanics that I do really like, however.  One is the system for monster movement.  It's very simple and introduces uncertainty in a very controlled and manageable way.  The sanity/stamina slider is also a very elegant but significant bit of player customization.

Heh.  I've been hacked by a rabid Arkham fan who changed my 5 to a 10 and wrote the below comment.  That'll teach me to leave myself logged in all over the place.  I've revised my rating upward slightly since.

An Arkham Horror SuperFan writes:

[i]Don't know what I was thinking with that "5". This is possibly the best game I've ever played. Every game is different, the challenge level is perfect (and can be adjusted with ease if needed). There is a ton of decision making (do we go for a seal victory or prepare to fight the ancient one? Should I go after monsters or spend my time shopping?) and resource management (gate trophies/ monster trophies/ money). The random elements keep the game fresh without ruining the strategic element. Character/resource management and team strategy is always more important than luck. I'm sure glad I realized the error of my ways and changed the score to what this masterpiece truly deserves.

A worthy update to a classic game.  NOT FOR EVERYONE.  You need to be a fan of Horror and HP Lovecraft to truly appreciate this one.  A liking of cooperative games is also a must.  There's a lot of heft to this box packed with tons of bits and a game that borders on RPG.

Raising my rating to 9 because of the Dunwich Horror improvements and, more so, because my kids really enjoy this so it's one game I never have to beg them to play with me.

A very well done adventure style game cooperative game.  It has beautiful graphics and game peices, plus gives a load of options to make every game feel different.  My one minor complaint is that it can be a little long for younger players (with short attention spans) as most games I've played thus far have gone nearly 3-4 hours.  All in all though, its a very great addition to the gaming world as its lots of fun and fills a niche which has been empty for some time.

Arkham horror is one of the first designer games I bought and played.The theme really drags you into the cthulu mythos and you really do feel like you're going around looking for elder signs and fighting unspeakable creatures from another dimension.

Excellent game, huge amount of replayability and a lot of Mythos flavor.  I strongly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Lovecraft. The game has some downsides, such as the sheer amount of pieces and upkeep can get to be a drag...it is the price we pay for the huge amounts of chrome. Play with 3 people or this becomes a long game.  Rated upwards.  The more you play it, the faster it goes.  My rating for the base game is 7, with the expansions (dark pharoah, Dunwitch Horror) this is a 10.

This game is great, thematically...the co-op and the concept are great.  I love the Lovecraft horror universe. 

The few down sides are the extremely long set up time, the very unclear rules, and the long play time (2-4 hours).

RATING: 7.5
Approx 3-4 hours long.   Complicated rules for a boardgame - lots of dice.  Learning Curve:  1 game to get the rules straight.  Played another game after a while - didn't take long to get back in the groove.

Very nice bits (thick linen cardboard).  Nice pictures for items,  events cards are mostly text,  but can change gameplay a lot.  Wish there were more pictures,  à la Shadows over Camelot.  And the "read the Mythos cards bottom-up"  is pretty annoying.

Plays like an RPG-lite.  I found it very atmospheric,  had a blast.  Kind of like a very fancy Fighting Fantasy novel.  High customisation potential (new characters, Ancient Ones).

All the bits are nice,  but makes for a pretty fiddly game.  I imagine a 3rd edition redesign could make this the be-all end-all game.  For now,  it's still based pretty heavily on random "skill-tests".  The skill test mechanic is usually pretty good,  although extreme results are possible (it's possible to just keep on rolling failure after failure).  Doesn't seem to be much of a way to predict what skill to optimise for - events are pretty random.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I want to like this game, and I do, but it is almost too much.  Sometimes the monsters are coming in so fast, that there is nothing you can do but wallow in failure.  Then, suddenly, you'll fight and defeat the big boss, and the game is over.  I don't get it, but I'll probably play it again sometime soon.  (the monsters are too cool!!)

I wanted to like this one.  It has nice and lots (poss too many) pieces/cards but there is too much downtime for my liking.  And then when you do get a go it can be over in an unexciting second.  I like the idea but don't think it is the best co-op game.  It also seemed to be very easy to win.  I do like some of the mechanics, so could be persuaded to play again.

The atmosphere for this game is top notch; just play the soundtrack to L.A. Noire in the background, always read the flavor text, and it'll be a genuine night with Lovecraft. Though combat and encounters are generally at the mercy of the 1/3 chance, the tension and feel of the game is delightful and makes up for it, that is if you like the classic horror genre.

RATING: 8.4
Best coop game I've played. Adapts well to differing numbers of players (up to 5 in my experience). Whilst the luck on the card draws can make it easy or hard in 10% of the games, they make the story in the rest, needing tight team play to win. Can still be fun to lose though. Base game is improved by more encounter cards from expansion for variety, even without expansion in play (some fudging). Only problem - it lead me to try and read some Lovecraft - the game is better!

This game was the first game I ever bought for this hobby.  Yea... this one.  I learned it and played it and we all enjoyed it.  I have to admit, having this be my first attempt at the gaming hobby was actually a blessing. (I succeeded on a 4,5, or 6!)  Now, I tear through most rule books and I learned better ways to teach games to others.  More importantly though, this game taught me what board games could do.  Before Arkham, I had no idea that a board game could be so much.  And for that, I owe Arkham Horror and it's designer Richard Luanius much gratitude.

We like playing this game on occasion. You have to be in the right frame of mind to play it. The most fun we have ever had playing it was when we first got it and only two of us had a go at it. It was so hard that we almost gave up, but looking back it was a blast. Really captured the mythos feel.

This game just really suffers with the more people you add. It can be a LONG wait between turns and there really isn't anything to keep you active or interested when it isn't your turn.

Played once so far. I tried to keep the game moving so we could play in a shorter amount of time. My biggest gripes about the game are that a whole game takes a long time and that there's nothing to do while waiting for other players to go.

Arkham Horror is more than a board game...it's an experience. It is littered with lots of little rules, is packed with many random elements and takes a considerable investment of time and space to play but the resulting journey is one of the most deeply thematic and humbling experiences in board gaming. And as good as the base game is, Arkham Horror really takes off with the introduction of the expansions.

Relaxing to play, nice theme. Will see how it stands after more plays.
Update: after seeing cards in location decks, it turns out that there's about 3 locations which are very beneficial, and the rest is useless or even badly hurting. Adapting gameplay to this, was able to drain all the bank in 2p and buy lots of stuff. Game became just a cakewalk. Lost interest in game after finding such balance issues. Sold.

Theme is just too dark for my group.  Fun game, really enjoyed playing it, but with people not liking the theme it means I'm not gonna get to play it much.  Traded it away for, I think, Power Grid, which sees a lot of play in my group.

This was the first real board game I got into. It still gets a lot of table-time, but nowehere near as much as it used to. An absolutely great cooperative game. I find our experience is enriched when there are people who know Lovecraft and 'pulp' Lovecraft playing as well. The example that comes to mind is a friend explaining that Nyarlothotep steals clue tokens because he steals information from you, robbing your mind of its memories. That made the final battle seem so much cooler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Classic, massive, messy game that, with unfortunate card draws and bad rolls, can be over almost instantly--or drag on for hours longer than desired; especially true if played with more than four players.  Excellent when it comes together, though, with a crazy narrative and unlikely characters.  Largely supplanted by Eldritch Horror, though, which is better focused on the GOO, and plays to a definite deadline. Sold to Polley.

As far as cooperative games go this is probably my favorite.  I've found that the biggest mistake new players make is being too conservative with their characters.  Most of my plays have been with all the expansions, which can make things challenging, but also interesting.    The only real downside anymore is just the time it takes to setup the game and tear it down, but the game play is fun and worth the effort.

RATING: 10
I very much enjoy the variety of this game.  I like that you can play 1 or more characters, that you can play with 1 or 2 or many players, that there are several characters with different characteristics, that the mix of characters is random (which will suggest different playing styles depending on which mix you get), that the Ancient One you fight in the end is random and has various attributes which again suggest different tactics.

All of this adds greatly to its replay value.  

And I love all the bits.  The artwork is nice and moody, but not gory.  On top of all that it's fun, and I'm already wondering if I've rated this too low.

Edit:  I've had to bump this from an 8 to a 10.  This is my game group's favorite game, with and without the expansions.  The replay is high; we really enjoy the variety of things that can happen, which makes us opt for a different strategy each game.

I really want to like this game but we get bogged down in the game mechanics and it kills the mood. What are we doing wrong? Takes tooo long.

I have enjoyed playing this game on the two occasions where I've managed to get half-a-dozen players together, but we've yet to successfully complete a session.

Good solo play. Co-operative game play gives it a RPG feel without the reams of notepaper and suffering GM.

Giant dining table a must however!

Short phase of intensive play followed by months of neglect, just don't have the time or patience to play this again. Maybe play again during the Christmas break...

It makes a pleasant diversion, but doesn't feel like a [i]game[/i] as such. It's nice but winning doesn't give me the same level of satisfaction as more tactical games do...

RATING: 6
The more we play the game the more we realize the mood has faded long time ago. The main problem is that all the encounters are too dry. Lovecraft was known for his rich descriptions of the environment and the characters yet here the descriptions look more like an excuse to make the system checks. That plus the terrible feeling of being drag into a mechanic that goes nowhere has make me drop my rating to 5 and everytime we play it it will probably go down if we do not use house rules.

Years after buying this game it is still a favourite of mine, even if I don't get to play it much.

I almost always prefer cooperative games, and I am a nutter for the works of Lovecraft and some of the authors that followed him, so Arkham Horror's highly thematic cooperative experience really does it for me.

Only real downside for me is the length of the game does mean it gets played a lot less often than I would like.

Played one full game solo with 4 investigators, had fun, messed up a couple rules and I think the game went on a couple turns after I should have lost.

Played partial two player game, also 4 total investigators.  Was going OK, just got too late to finish.

It is fun, very heavy on theme, mostly just random things happening to you, but it is fun to roll a handful of dice and kill a demon.

EDIT: Haven't gotten this to the table in a while, and not sure I want to. I enjoy parts of it, but other parts are too fiddly (monster movement, for example). Considering trading.

This is a co-operative game set in the Cthulhu mythos. It has several scenarios with various "baddies". The cooperation between players is necessary to win. This was a time issue for our group because we discussed things way to much. I think it would get better the more you play.

Mechanics might not be mind blowingly good, and there is quite a bit of bookkeeping, but I really like the narrative qualities and make-the-best mentality.

Pick up clue tokens, kill monsters, seal gates.  When not doing that, have largely unpredictable random encounters.  The game seems to be trying to be an RPG, but it isn't.  It's trying to be atmospheric, but it's not.  The artwork and bits are nice; the game is repetitive and not fun.  As a cooperative game, Arkham Horror also fails.  Where Shadows Over Camelot (which I rate a 6, ok game) has a steadily building tension and allows players to address worsening hotspots, Arkham Horror just seems like an unruly, random mess.  I hope never to play it again.

I really really love Lovecraft's works and I wanted this game for a long time. Once I get it I was very disappointed:
If you have a small house, which is my case, this game is almost unusable, its board is so huge that you don't have any place to put it. 
The setup takes so many time that when you are finished with it you are tired and bored and you don't want to play.
Finally I find it too repetitive (monster > go to that place > fight > monster > go to that place > fight > over and over). I really love the investigation part of a RPG, not the fighting part, so this game based almost only in the fighting part doesn't meet my expectations.

This is the game that got me started to designer boardgames, and I still think it has something to offer. Unfortunatly it's a product that ages quickly and not very gracefully. After a while it bored me to death. Maybe one day I'll dust it off and play it again, but at the moment it has steadly slipped down in my scale of playability.

I love the theme but this is the sort of adventure game I really don't like. If you're into storytelling why not play a session of Call of Cthulhu instead? If you must play it, do so with fewer players (four at most) otherwise you can have very little input as the game drags on and on.

I'm going to go with an 8 on this one because I enjoyed playing this a lot.  As a character I didn't feel completely overwhelmed.  I mean, we were always getting screwed but it wasn't like [GameID=29368] where there was no chance of hope.  There were glints of light that we capitalized on.

My character had [i]Claustrophobia[/i] most of the game and was only driven insane a few time.

Fiddly is an understatement when it comes to this game but luckily we had some AH experts on hand to run the game.  It wasn't so bad for the newbs.  I can't imagine tackling this game without any idea of the rules.

Another reason this game isn't high for me is the down time.  We started with 3 and we eventually amassed 6 or 7.  I didn't find there to be much player interaction other than telling a person what to do or being told what to do which usually happens in co-op games.

Overall though very good experience.  Even when I rolled those low numbers I cheered because thematically it works.

The theme is very solidly implemented (mmmm grammar).

I am not assigning a rating to this game until I've played a proper game with people who know what they're doing. There are so many rules in AH that it's nearly impossible to trudge through the entire game for the first time without stopping midway and pulling out one's hair. I love the game mechanics- the ones I understand, anyways. And I love the theme of the game, being a big Lovecraft fan and a horror fan. But, damn...the page-after-page rulebook and the tiny, tiny things that make a huge difference to the game's outcome just make me want to scream.

RATING: 8
Long, complex and fiddly games are not usually my first choice. This game is all of those things, but also one of my favourites. The cooperative nature of the game makes it much easier to bear the length (I care what happens on everyone's turn.) Only one or two players need to be well-versed in the complexity, since you can cover the basics then just go over other stuff as it comes up. The fiddliness is what gives each game its unique story and character. I do recommend getting one or two of the expansions if only to have more variety in the location decks, though the expansions offer much more than that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The "in medias res" strategy of the storytelling in this game doesn't get enough credit.  People complain that the events seem too random and come out of nowhere.  But the vignettes on the cards are skillfully designed to be fragments that can create the illusion of a larger story and world -- and I think it does that better than most other games, which often just end up with a pile of discrete stories.

And despite another common complaint, the game actually does reward tactics and strategies.  Yes, you will often get blown off course -- but you can't win if you don't have plans and follow through on most of them.

This is a great game, and the best proof of that pudding is my girlfriend making the first move to play it with me instead of me promising the moon and other chores...
The game is very challenging because it makes every investigator an easy target and one should be ready to take on some flak. The player may take time to gather material or allies, but then monsters pile up and there are portals everywhere. So far it looks like fighting the Old One is mission: impossible with a lesser number of investigators, so I think that games with 1 or 2 player should be played with several investigators per player. A game takes a few hours to complete when rules are assimilated and it takes only a thorough game to be sufficiently familiar with them.
Replayability is high due to the number of different investigators to choose from at the beginning, and the rest is up to luck and some tactics about how to use spells, clues, and chosing the right target at the right time.
The game material is great, standard with current Fantasy Flight products, and is a pleasure to play with.

As you'll no doubt have realised from the many positive reviews, this is a great game.  Firstly, for the money you pay you get a ton of stuff. Not necessarily the biggest plus point, but then again I've paid twice as much for some games to get a few minis and not much else.  Secondly, it's brimming with theme and got my son well and truly hooked (which is a good thing ... stops him sitting texting for hours on end).  The only downside is your evening disappears in a flash.  Takes hours to play, but it really doesn't seem like it.

UPDATE  - One  month in and I love this game; jjust can't get enough. It's now a 10.

Great components and theme.  Hate the fiddly nature of the game, the "subject to every gentle breeze" -style rules wherein even the designer of the game says he plays with multiple PAGES of house rules.  Hate billions of dollars in expansions.  Hate shuffling 100 decks of cards just in the base game.  Not much of a story, despite what many say.  HOWEVER, the setting, the moody theme created by flavor text and components is pretty sweet.  Minus the flowchart-style effects rules, that alone would have made it a keeper.  Still willing to play as long as someone else is in charge of all the bullshit.

One of my favorite Co-op games, which I love for it's theme and that it allows for a bit of roleplaying at the table. The game does take quite some time with 4+ players, which causes this game to hit the table less frequently as I often have to plan playing the game.

Nevertheless, I love how you can customize your character based on the situation, improving your sneaking to stay hidden for a monster while waiting for the cavalry to arrive and them change it back to full speed to get quickly where you need to go.

I'll always play with random character selection and random selection of greater evil.

Meh. Very meh. Don't really want to play it again.

I'm a big Lovecraft fan, and I like the idea of the game. But it doesn't really feel Lovecraftian at all, and it goes on far too long. Last time I played I found it very frustrating that I'd have loved to get to something down the other end of town but there were lots of monsters in the way so it didn't make much sense to waste multiple turns just moving and fighting.

I would definitely play if the opportunity arose. If we could get it in in less than 5 hours I'd be pretty stoked.

Fantasy Flight 06/2005 edition
Enjoyable theme marred by overly complex bookkepping. Somehow it just feels this could have been made a little more streamlined like the Warrior Knights update. I wonder how Arkham horror might have played with a card-based combat system or if it wasn't possible to consider.  The game relies a little too much on player imagination to create the mood - it would have been nice to have scenarios for each monster instead of the same old gate, opens, monsters come out. All game, every game. 

Update: Nice to see they cleaned up the board (with a yellow-tinted background) for the reprints...My version was so graphically heavy it was distracting. 

Although similar in some ways, I think RUNEBOUND: arkham edition might have worked better.

This game is too long, takes about 20 minutes to setup and about 4-6 hours to play. It has too many unnecessary elements and fiddly bits to mentally remember which makes progress excruciatingly slow first time around. There is hardly any player cooperation which adds to the boredom of waiting for other players to finish their turn. Despite the thematic elements, the reward for playing is just too low.

{ P - 1 2 [3] [4] [5] 6 7 8 }

Still the best in co-operative gaming. Lovecraftian theme isn't just pasted on - it meshes seamlessly with the game's robust mechanics, including controlling the number of gates in Arkham, doom tokens, monster limit + outskirts + terror level, varying types of items, sanity/stamina gauges, and stat bars with tradeoffs. There are plenty of things to do in Arkham - gather clues, make and spend money, fight monsters, seal gates, complete tasks, courier items, mitigate rumors - while the item decks and mythos deck ensure that a repeat of a game with all the same characters, guardian/herald, and GOO will be materially different.

I have played with all of the expansions through Lurker at the Threshold and don't recommend mixing them randomly because additional expansions dilutes the effect of each. For example, including both board expansions, Dunwich and Innsmouth, reduces the likelihood that you draw gates from either.

Curse of the Dark Pharaoh
This is a very minor card-only expansion. The main points of interest are the new allies and the spells Astral Travel, Feeding the Mind, and Revelation of Script. Exhibit items are difficult to come by and their effects are hit-or-miss.

Dunwich Horror
This is a board expansion and absolutely crucial. Without Dunwich, the number of unstable locations is too few so there's no real threat of losing to doom tokens. If you can seal three of the four majors (Woods, Witch House, Unvisited, Independence) you basically win. Injury and Madness cards are perfect design; I can't imagine playing without them. Gate Bursts add urgency; investigators can't be certain every elder sign seal will stick. It is necessary for investigators to visit Dunwich to kill monsters and seal gates, though admittedly the stable locations are useless. The new spells, excluding Call Friend and Wrack, are excellent. The majority of the new common and unique items are also very well-designed, with the exception of the missions, which are largely impractical to accomplish.

Dunwich is the only expansion you need for a challenging game. With four players, I highly recommend the designer's suggestion of having two monsters on every gate, as is normal in 5-8 player games. At this point you have two main problems. First, the terror level isn't relevant. It can increase and increase but it doesn't really mean anything until it hits 10. This is where the King in Yellow herald enters the picture; he basically sets the standard that every good herald should either increase the terror level faster or penalize you when the terror level increases. Secondly, the game is very slanted towards unique items. Every item deck has its fair share of mediocre junk but the unique item deck has power cards like Elder Signs, King in Yellows, True Magick, Mi-Go Brain Case, and many others. The only comparable cards in the common item deck are Old Journal, Press Pass, Sledgehammer, maybe one or two more. The spell deck has nothing at that level; it is bogged down with too many weapon spells (unique weapons are almost always better) and only-situationally-useful cards like Flesh Ward and Voice of Ra. The top tier of spells includes Find Gate, Mists of Releh, Vision Quest, and Alchemical Process ... 12 out of 61 spells. Uniques by comparison offer a better top tier at 7 out of 64 uniques, a better second tier (Mi-Go Brain Case, Healing Stone, Pallid Mask, Silver Key, etc.), and you shop three at a time versus two at Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. Basically once you have enough games under your belt you are going to find yourself going for retainers, buying uniques at the Curiositie Shoppe, sealing gates and turning in the trophies at the Science Building, while ignoring common items and spells and other trophy spots. There's no precedent, but if you prefer a bit of balance consider tweaking the common item and spell decks to make them better, and making the unique item deck a little worse.

King in Yellow
Half of a great herald! The three act part is dumb and very literal, codifying the bad Mythos = unwinnable game effect. Blighted allies however are genius; the terror level needs to hurt like this every increment. Many of the unique items are spectacularly bad.

Kingsport Horror
Workable, but design-wise this is a major step back. Adding unstable locations would make too many areas for gates to appear, but instead of reassigning the unstables or finding someway to compensate, the board is all stable. So nobody goes to Kingsport because they don't need to and it isn't useful, which means the expansion uses rifts as a punitive measure for not visiting Kingsport. Most of the new characters are also riddled with problems - really over-the-top powerful designs like guaranteed starting Elder Sign and auto-Evade, or Press Pass as an ability for every clue. Daisy Walker is broken any number of ways and Lily Chen is pretty close. Also what is with mythos cards like "move the first investigator to the SHH" with no skill check involved? On a positive note the GOO's other than Eihort were quite good.

Innsmouth
Design seems to have fallen off a cliff. The GOO's are worthless. Randomly devouring people (Qauchil Uttaus, Ghatanothoa) doesn't matter and you can prepare by giving away items. Zhar and Rhan Tegoth could be easy or hard; how much grief they give you is chance-dependent. Nyogtha and the Jungle Fever guy don't do anything, Cthuga's fine, and Bokrug is playable at least. The new investigators take broken to a whole new level. People that start with things like Find Gate and King in Yellow, or multitudes of clue tokens (lol gravedigger). Someone with 5 fight and can avoid horror checks. Roland Banks is mathematically imbalanced. He has an extra focus and will out of nowhere; after his skill and ally he's basically good at everything. (Looking at the construction, apparently his useful ability is valued at $0.) The violinist - who was smoking what. Innsmouth track is another big fail. If gates don't open in Innsmouth early, the track does nothing. Unlike Dunwich's elegant vortex placement, monsters in Innsmouth either move straight into vortices or take forever as they shuffle about the trianglular streets.

Lurker at the Threshold
Is this a guardian or a herald? Pretty helpful for a herald!

My favorite game at the moment.  It is quite a long game with a lot of complexity, but I enjoy it a lot.  That said, using at least Dunwich or Innsmouth is essential for me at this point as I can easily win a game that does not have those expansions due to the lack of additional unstable (gate opening) locations.

I have to confess, that I love cooperative board games so remember that when reading my comment.

This is one of my favorite games but it's only because a real fanboy of Lovecraft, and it doesn't have any real connection with the books, only names and criatures, there's no plot and interesting stories. It's an artificial and action game based in Lovecraft's ambientation. You can look deeply at my opinion about this game in my friend's webpage http://www.ludopaticos.es
After a lot of time not playing this game I'm giving it a lower rating and I'm seriously thinking to sell it.

Este es uno de mis juegos favoritos, pero es sólo porque soy un verdadero fanboy de Lovecraft, y no tiene ninguna conección real con los libros, sólo nombres y criaturas, no hay trama ni historias interesantes.

After playing LOTR, Shadows Over Camelot, and now this, I finally realized I simply don't like cooperative games.  This seems like the best in the genre, though, and it's problems seem largely forgivable.  Things like length and the fiddly nature of the game annoy me, but I don't think it's really a knock on the game.  After one play, I was impressed if not all that entertained.

excellent entry in the coop game genre -- much better if you enjoy the theme.  we found it to be rather easy with five folks pitted against the poor major deity.  The more you play the game, the more the theme, and all the intricacies come out.  One or two plays really doesn't do it justice.  There's so much variability, what with the different characters and elder gods, that i end up enjoying it more almost everytime i play.  with the Dunwich Horror expansion coming out, i can see playing this a bunch more times, and liking it better each time.  so, this is a great game.

Wow, that's a lot of cards. Once you are done sorting and shuffling though, setup really isn't that bad. Sort of a paradox really, there's so much to be explored in this game (shops, locations, strange items) in a relativly short time, yet the manner in which the game is won or lost (closing gates or beating the final bad guy) is such a simple concept. Very high replay value, and the rules aren't really that bad (remembering some of the more arbitrary values is kind of rough). Still, the size of this one may put off some, and I've noticed that the dice seem to come up sixes an awful lot, but maybe I'm just really lucky. God, that witch lady is hot.

Enjoyable game of Lovecraftian horror. I LOVE the RPG and this new version of the boardgame does a decent job of recreating that experience. It's a co-op game with you against the system and, as such, one can feel a bit detached from the goings-on at times. A solid game, however.

Great immersion, great mechanisms, good fun, but waaaay too long and probably too ambitious in terms of gameplay. I like in-depth games but I think this game could have been streamlined a bit.

Sounds like the game has been made obsolete by Eldricht Horror, but I´m glad I have it and would definitely play it again.

[b]THIS GAME MADE ME FAIL MY SANITY ROLL.[/b]

There are more bells and whistles in the box to this game than I've seen in many other bigger, better games. That being said, the artwork is top-notch, and the theme is as glorious as Shud M'El rising from the deep, mewling for manflesh. The downside is that the game is as longwinded as one of said monster's tentacles.

I wanted to love this game. Really I did. When I finally bedded her she was all looks, no talent.

[b]THE STARS ARE RIGHT:[/b]

1. Beautiful artwork. On everything.
2. Amazing theme.
3. Depth.
4. Semi-RPG riff going on.
5. Great cards for literally every bloody thing.
6. Oodles of equipment and magic thingamabobs.
7. Can be expanded to your heart's desire.

1. Rubbish board.
2. Overcomplicated.
3. Too much game maintenance.
4. Too big a boardgame for "normal" dining rooms. You need a 6' by 4' table, for pity's sake!

This game is a lot of fun to play. It works well if you have people who don't like conflict as you are working as a team in this game. It can be a little of the easy side as I have yet to lose a game but there is no point in the game that I feel like we are doing really well. If you feel like the game is to easy what I tried was every time you lose all of your sanity or stamina you have to draw a new investigator, lose all your items and skills and your old one is replaced with a monster (fitting your death or insanity) if you were knock out in Arkham. This made the game much more intense in my opinion. It made us play more cautiously so that we didn't loose all our stuff.

Was really excited to try this out for the first time, always wanted to participate in a co-op board game.  However, having to muddle through the setup and rules, trying to understand how everything works while explaining it to others, needing to pay attention to every single detail as the first player.  The whole session felt more like work than play.  I imagine I would've had a better time with it had I been taught by a more experienced person.  I wasn't turned off by it, but I was glad when it was finally over, victory didn't taste as sweet as I had hoped it would be.  Well, I'm looking forward to trying it again in the near future, and maybe this time it would go a lot smoother and faster, I would like to improve "leading" the game before introducing Arkham Horror to the rest of my family, so their first time with it will be better than mine.

After 2 sessions now I bumped the rating up to 8 because the game does become a lot more enjoyable the more you are used to the flow.

As we heard that setting up this game would take about one hour minimum, and that playing would also take a couple of hours, we had to wait until time was on our side, to play this one. Once in a blue moon, we have time to screw around. Woke up this morning and told M. that we had no time to lose. Started to set up the game. And everybody is right about this one. It took us something over an hour to set it up. And we have to say, that we bagged and labeled everything, which means that we almost have no work with sorting components. As we already watched a video review of this game, and we’ve played Elder Sign before, the reading of the rules was pretty quick done (something about 1 hour). Then it was time to play. When you’re having fun, time flies, and before we knew, we were defeated by the Ancient One. We looked at the clock, and it showed us, that 4 hours passed since we started the game. And we weren’t bored a single minute. In basic this game isn’t too difficult. Just 5 steps, that are pretty easy to remember.

    Update your investigator cards and skills.
    Move
    Encouter in Arkham
    Encouter in the Other World
    Play a Mythos card

The first two steps shouldn’t be a problem at all. The encounters makes it a bit more complex (especially, as all the text on the cards is in English, and English isn’t our mother language) (but, this is a cooperative game, and two know more then one, this it’s workable), just as playing the Mythos card will. But it all isn’t really hard. It’s just a lot of it. Also the checks that has to be played are pretty easy when you played a couple of them. It’s just a matter of adding and subtraction numbers and then roll the die. When you roll a 5 or 6 (or a 4 when you’re blessed), then you have a success. When you have enough successes, you full-fill the check that you’re doing. Basically that’s all there is. Of course, there are dozens of additional rules and exceptions, but if you remember these basic things (playing order, how to full-fill a check and the fact that’s cooperative), you can play this game. This is just a fantastic game. Minor thing is that you will need lots and lots of time to play it.

First and foremost, This game has to be the most complex I have ever played, especially when multiple expansions are added to the base set!  

I think the artwork is stunning and the game components are very nicely done.  I think actual miniatures for the investigators would really take this to the top, but so much is packed into the box for the price as it is.  There are a TON of components inside!  

The game play can get very fiddly at times though and the difficulty level to win is relatively high, but not winning every game is what makes the game truly unique!  I expect to lose more often than not and that aspect may not appeal to everyone.

The game is dripping with the Cthulhu theme and has to be one of the best out there! It certainly is not for everyone.  Yet the atmosphere it helps to create will be unlike other games carrying this theme.

I look forward to playing more expansions in the future! :goo:

[UPDATE] 
It has been a few years since my initial remarks, and I can report that this game has fallen in both my ratings and my eagerness to play it.  

It all comes down to two reasons: it is extremely fiddly and with the addition of each expansion players decide to incorporate into the experience (with the exception of Dunwich Horror) that aspect gets utterly worse and worse!  Also, it takes FOREVER to play!  Now I like a good, long game, please take a look at my list and you will see that sitting down for an epic adventure is all fine by me, but this one can certainly lag on for no good reason.  In my opinion, a streamlined design, more actions available to players on their turns and better, more useful weapons could repair many player's complaints.

As it stands currently, this game does not see the table as much as it should.  Sad, but very true.

The amount of work, and good editing that went into this game is amazing.  Its fabric is densely woven with theme; however, for my tastes, there is way more mucking around with rules, phases, steps, cards, and tokens than there should be for the really small number of interesting decisions to make.  Like [thing=10547]Betrayal at House on the Hill[/thing], there's just too little interesting going on, and negligible strategy to be had.  Unlike [thing=10547]Betrayal at House on the Hill[/thing], Arkham Horror is specifically designed to last at least X long, where X is way, way too long for my tastes:  After four hours, I would prefer to be more than merely halfway toward just one of the victory conditions - in fact, I'd prefer to have played several exhilarating games laden with agonizing decisions!

However, as with all "experience" games, playing with the right people - especially if the time was pre-ordained for this game - can make for a fun time.

I think cooperative games are not my cup of tea. Arkham Horror has a nice theme, but maybe too many small parts. Why do characters have convenient sliders for attributes, but too much unnecessary junk for money and health? If you roleplay the events just a little, it's more enjoyable than just going through the motions mechanically.

Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fthagn! I wated for this game like a thing from Yuggoth, but after couple of games, I don't know.. I would like to love this game, but something is in the way.. Theme is good, except that I don't like that all the mythos creatures have decided to travel to Arkham at once. Arkham seems like Sunnydale now (which is not a bad thing at all...) and not that mysterious place from Lovecrat's stories. But hey, this is a boardgame so I just push that little rebellious brat out of me and join the cult. 8 for now, maybe drops to 7 (as it have been..). Now I'll have to return to Arkham and kick some Cthulhu-butt.

update: the pulp, B-move kind-of approach to mythos doesn't bother me anymore, but the way game plays feels a little bit fiddly and if you just approach this game mechanically instead of drenching yourself into the atmosphere, it kills this game, it's super dry and dull. But if you immerse youself into the story and character, this can be fun.

Went a little bit overboard on this one buying so many expansions. It's thematic and fun but you really have to be in that "have a story unfold"-mood. Mostly played 2 player with 2 investigators each and had most fun that way. When I introduced it to one of our regular gaming buddies I think he was somewhat underwhelmed at basically just reacting to random stuff happening on the board and had trouble seeing what we possibly liked about it. I can see his point but still, it's a game with a definite place in my collection.

Arkham Horror is a pretty good deep co-op game. I enjoy running around the city looking for clues and then jumping into gates to fight off the rise of the Old Ones. It suffers a bit from being niche locked into a 3 or 4 player game, from my experience. 2 player and 5 player games both feel overwhelming and don't really give you a chance to do anything useful before waking the Old One.

Knowing I'm a fan of h.p.lovecraft my fiendish friends used this game as an introduction to their gaming group. Up until that fateful night the most complex game I had played was solar quest (with lasers) about 20 years ago. Arkham Horror was an eye opener and an instant hit with me. I found the rules complex at first (to be honest I still have to check the rule book all the time), but my friends have played A.H. for years and were able to explain things quickly as the game progressed...to the inevitable madness and devouring of investigators that seems to be the most common way our adventures end.

I'd recommend that first-time players invite a veteran A.H. gamer to help explain the rules and turns,but don't let that put you off. This game has an immersive quality and builds a unique narrative each time you take on the Ancient Ones. We usually only have three players, but have found it's best if we each control two investigators with the first-player marker moving between them as if it was a six player game.

We also use the Innsmouth and Dunwich etc expansions and they  add even more depth to the game-play.

To sum up I am a biased fan of this excellent game. If you like lovecraft and have not played this game go and buy a copy now. If you don't know lovecraft, but like the idea of battling hordes of undead and extra-dimensional beings then this is the game for you, get a copy now.

This thing had a few plays with various expansions and numbers of players. My rating reflects my thoughts on the game plus expansions as a whole, since it's impossible to separate them in my mind. Biggest con of this game: Too fiddly - too much setup, too many pieces. I never thought I'd say this... "too many pieces"... Game is confusing as hell, but also great thematic fun. If you don't mind putting an hour or two of work in to set it up (on a table twice as big as the universe), and if you then don't mind that you're sure to forget at least ten rules per play for the first ten plays. 

Oh, and putting the whole thing away again... I'd say that's another half hour to forty-five minutes.

Edit: Starting to think about downgrading this since there has never been that much incentive to take it out. It's always a "planned" occurrence, never a gut feeling of "just wanting to play"

Edit edit: I upgraded it instead.

Но игра хороша, когда разбёрешься - затягивает. Игра на часы, на ночь, на день. Множество дополнений разнообразят процесс.

Can be somewhat complex and long. Not for the casual player.
That being said, if you are a fan of Lovecraft, this is the game for you.

Love the Lovecraft theme. I like to roleplay my characters and thus I always have fun when I play the game. I don't think the rules are hard, it's the rulebook that not very structured. I believe it's more a repeated mantra here on bgg that this game is hard to learn/play, but in reality I never had a problem teaching the game to new people. It's not easy to win though there is a strategy that mostly works. There's great variety between each game.  

While Eldritch Horror is a more slick variant, I have a feeling that AH is more of an immersive horror roleplay thing than EH is. The latter feels a bit more randomly thrown together Indiana Jones with Cthulhu mish-mash. 

Negative points: 
A lot of luck is involved. The deck can leave the players with no chance to win. You need luck to draw good cards, mostly its something bad that happens to you. There is also a great amount of luck with the dice you roll for everything from fighting, sneaking, card texts, closing gates, casting spells etc. 

Fiddly setup with all the card decks, and one of the biggest boardgames to setup on a table. A nightmare to properly store back in the box. 

On playtime: the game can take a long time to play. I would not recommend it with a lot of players. Also it's a game that I like to play once each year, but not more than that. You also need the right kind of players for this more then in other games.

Good luck compiling all the rules for the game - the rulebook is one of the most notoriously lacking documents in the whole boardgaming industry. But they are out there, and when you find them, the result is one of the most engaging and mentally challenging co-operative games out there.

After playing Ghost Stories, and although this one is chock-full of depth, I wish it were more challenging. It's far too forgiving which causes the game to drag on and on. As with most Fantasy Flight games, it has an awesome theme and incredible artwork. You need half an afternoon to plough through it. (7.5/10 after one play)

This game has all of the usual crap that FFG likes to put in their games that make it slow and ungainly, but it scores points for having a cool theme and for being cooperative.  You get to kill zombies and other supernatural undesirables.

RATING: 8
A great game with 2-4 players. It's immensely more fun when people take the time to get into character a bit and read more than the game effects on their cards.

It's also a cooperative game, which provides a nice change.

Lowered from 7 to 6 b/c of the playtime and b/c there are now so many better choices for cooperative games - e.g. Pandemic, Battlestar Galatica, Red November

My least favourite cooperative game of all time. The extremely slow pace and extended downtime are simply not to my liking.

Leider nie die Anleitung richtig verstanden... Ich habe normalerweise keine Probleme mit englischen Spielen, aber Arkham Horror und Netrunner waren mir zu übel.

Not RPG-lite so much as RPG without any narrative, just random items given to random characters that occasionally align. Oh, and lots of rolling dice to perform skill checks for no apparent reason. Just ew.

I'm not a huge fan of co-op games.  This one feels both overly random and fiddly.  The theme is good, but that's not enough to keep my attention long term.

RATING: 9
The definitive board game, at least to this point in my gaming career. Perfect blend of theme, style and substance, and the randomness and variability only make the game that much more satisfying. This is a game of theme and doom first, and strategy second. If that is likely to upset you, this is definitely not your cup of tea. For me, though, it's as close to a RPG as a board game has ever come.

EDIT: 1/16/14
Finally played this with a group of core gamers. Went over amazingly well. Bumping the score a final time. Gonna' be a long time till something replaces this as my favorite game.

If it weren't for my enjoyment of and appreciation for Lovecraftian literature, I'm not sure if I would like this game as much, as I'm normally not too interested in cooperative games.  That being said, I really enjoy this game.  I've only won the game once, but, to me (and my group), that's not the point.  It's Lovecraft:  How are we going to go crazy this time?  That's how we approach the game, and, while we give it our best, we're predominantly interested in the story that transpires than whether we win.

Great game, if not a little rules intensive.  I find Coop style games very enjoyable as the competitive tension isn't there and this is pretty much as good as it gets.  Amazing theme, a lot of variety, and mechanics that are very fun once you have got them all down.  A perfect game to play with friends while drinking a beer on a snowy Saturday night.

This is a game to Lovecraft's fans and true boardgamers, who can allow to play a 4-6 hours per 1 game.

RATING: 5.5
Pretty complicated (20+ page rules book) but enjoyable, purely co-operative game - but way too long.  Stacks of atmosphere for the die hard Mythos fans *guilty hand raise* and a nice feeling of tension is built when the town is over run with monsters, the Old One is close to waking, but only one more gate needs closing....
However, this is a BIG, LONG game.  Expect 3 hours to come and go with ease, and don't plan to play this on a small coffee table.  The board alone is far bigger than most games out there today, and thats without factoring in the reems of cards (not to mention expansions).

I'd rather play BSG, which has better fun/time ratio than AH.

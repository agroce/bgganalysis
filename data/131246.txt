RATING: 7
A nice reduction of the board game.  It gives a little of the same experience, but works quite well as a standalone game.  The multipurpose symbols really translate well into a card game.  I like it!

Fabulous, under-reported game in which simple mechanisms and settings are integrated. Resources are discovered with card flips and paid for with cards in hand. Cards in hand are also used to hire more workers (to get more resources), to hire salesmen (to get more money for your resources), etc. Cards in hand diminish each turn, which makes each decision agonizing.

Great quick engine builder that works well at all counts.  Like the triple use cards (person/resource or 2 cards to count as a person/resource).  Plays quick, pleasant and fun.  Like this much more than splendor.

Pretty neat card game, playing pairs of cards to claim goods for points. The strategy comes in with all the possible upgrades you can do: workers for more good claiming, investors for more card efficiency, and salesman to increase the value of the cards you claim. Interesting enough, but nothing ground breaking here.

In order to win Siberia: The Cardgame, you have to be the player who collects the most valuable resources by playing matching cards from your hand. To get there, you can invest into your personal infrastructure which makes certain resources more valuable to you or enables you to collect more resources depending on the route you choose. The more you invest into it, the better will be the payoff when collecting resources. But invest too many cards into building up your workforce and you won't have enough time to score big.
That's the main dilemma which the game presents in an easy to digest package to the people playing it. I did enjoy the game and I guess Siberia: The Cardgame could be used as a nice filler to start of or end a game night. It's nothing to write home about but it's a good, light and short family friendly card game.

Siberia: The Card Game strikes me somewhat as a more Euro(ised) and mathy version of Port Royal; there is definitely a push your luck element but without the busting.

This game is very much about timing and optimal choices, which are often not readily apparent as turn-to-turn play is somewhat reactionary and players cannot go into the game with a fixed strategy.

Despite it seeming like there can be a runaway leader, as long as all players play moderately well the endings tend to be much more clutch than they appear at first glance.

Care for a light, fast paced card game for the family, friends and casual gamers? 

Siberia is for you then. It is simple yet clever, it plays quickly (20 mns) but every action is a decision in itself and I have not played a game of it so far without being asked for a rematch.

I've never played siberia, so I can only talk about this expantion as a stand alone game and I have got to say it is fantastic. 
It was quick to learn and intuitive to play. The are is clean and fun and the quality of the cards good. 
The rules are clear and can play very quickly with so many different ways to win. It's a keeper :)

I haven't played the boardgame so no comment how the cardgame compares to this. Sibera: The Card Game is a short filler that plays out in 20 minutes and offers a basic experience of building up a small engine to increase the power of your actions while trying to be one step ahead of the opponents' moves. It plays well with two players. Nothing to write home about or look out for but I would be willing to play it again.

A somewhat mathy points drafting game where cards on hand have double functions: get points cards or improve drafting scope/efficiency/payoff. This means there are decisions to be made, but the double randomness of card draws and draft flips is noticeable: failure to draw early workers especially is a killer.

okay card game that flew under the radar. i won't play this with four but unlike jaipur it is playable with 2 to 4 players.

jaipur is easier in scoring. that is the downside to this game. with the modifiers it is a lot to tally up. and that is coming from someone who has outpost as one of his favourite games.

hence my six rating. it is a bit harsch that rating. i would have scored it higher as a 2 player game

oh one of the big plusses is that this game is easy to explain. and because of how this game works the strategy is determined by your hand cards and the resources available. so there definately is replayability. it didnt wow me , but few games manage that nowadays.

[b]Siberia: The Card Game[/b] was sold via Marketplace 6/14/15

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Looking back at my comments from a year ago I was spot on, except in my ranking, and have sold this game. It is quite light and really doesn't do anything mechanics wise that stands out. I'd play this again as a quick filler, but would never choose it hence why it's no longer in my collection. Like many card games there are just too many better options.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I saw this game mentioned on a geekbuddy's New to Me list. I ended up finding an inexpensive copy a few months ago and finally got it to the table. It is a very simple game where you are playing cards to collect resources trying to earn the most money for the resources you've collected. There are a few worker cards that adjust the endgame payout of resources, but the game is still quite straight forward and seems to play out very similarly game to game. It's a game my son enjoys, so we'll get some more plays in, but there isn't enough there to keep this game in our collection for the long term.[/i]

The game-play consists of simple card drafting from which the player makes combinations that allow him to either retrieve "upgrade" cards (people) or "point" cards (resources)... and that's really it! However, there is nice resource management and optimization problems involved that do require some strong considerations with a smattering of press your luck in your choice of uncovering available resources. In addition, the rules are easy to teach, the game length very short (20-30 minutes max), and the artwork is attractive to players.

I do have a few gripes - the luck isn't great but you really are at the mercy of what is drawn; this is mitigated somewhat by taking a turn to simply draw two cards to expand your hand size which, due to the 2-for-1 trade-in ability, all cards have some merit. Furthermore, the rule book was quite vague on a few points; the online version is much more clear - not sure why its more expanded than the included rule book and I highly recommend you print out that version and include it with the game.

All that said, this still remains a delightful surprise considering it was a mere four dollars from a sale. Its BGG rank of ~3000 demonstrates how grossly under appreciated this game really is. In fact, it has me interested in seeking our the board game version of [b]Siberia[/b]!

OK card game. I am afraid that the strategic decisions would not be that interesting after few games as the initial setup is always the same for helper cards --> play style will probably settle into an equilibrium and each game would be pretty much similar (from the "grand strategy" side, at least)

Set collection draft card game buying and selling resources from a central tableau. Resources are different rarity and value makes for interesting choices. Buy special characters that specialize in production cost, volume or selling price in the market adds an interesting dynamic. The cards of this game can be added to the base game is a cool design consideration.

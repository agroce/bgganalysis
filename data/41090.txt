A nice, quick building game. The game is surprisingly robust for a game using generic components. It will take a few more plays to settle my opinion on it. But for a light diversion that is cheap and easy to make, it is a hard one to beat. Feels similar to a general light-euro style of gameplay.

Wow! This is the very first decktet game I tried, and I must say I am amazed!
The game is straightforward and fast, but it has meaningful decisions, and it feels like Catan card game had a son with Battle Line!
Higher rank cards are most difficult to build, but they are more likely to produce, while lower rank cards are useful towards the end of the game to steal majority in some districts... There's a whole world of great fillers included in a decktet? The debut seems encouraging...

I haven't played it, but the rules read like a simplified Settlers of Catan Card Game sort of resource-driven building game, or maybe something along the lines of Through the Ages mixed with Battle Line.

The bits are especially nice, with color printed medium density fiberboard tokens and snappy square corner glossy cards.

Battle line with a touch of resource management and push your luck.  The no-luck crowd will be turned-off with the resource die roll, but it creates a nice tension by increasing uncertainty in the zero-sum game.

Tension often remains until the last turn. The build-up of both resources and cards that generate resources allows for larger moves toward the end, keeping the endgame uncertain.

one of those under-the-radar games, and not only because it is only a 2-player ... vie for control across a stately border -- only five outposts are up for grabs, this Decktet origin card game can be quite tactical, how and where you dedicate your resources, and which cards to drop for those resources can make all the difference .. sure, there is a die roll, but in keeping with the situation, it is not the be and end all ... great tension, and decisions, where to respond to your opponent, or do you give up an area, to open another front .. this is brimming with tactical decisions, and has tension and brain draining decisions built in ... simply an excellent 2-player, and always willing to play this

Magnate is an interesting game of resource collection, development and control, played using the extended Decktet and also requiring about 72 resource tokens in 6 colors, plus a 6-sided and (2) 10-sided dice (though I suppose you could roll the same die 2x). 

NOTE: I used Stack dice for the resource tokens, and while I simply used individual dice, I could also have easily used the dots to collect larger numbers of resources and used only four dice of each color. Ideally the dice should match the suits (which these did only 2/3 of the time.)

I definitely enjoyed the game, and played a very close solo two player match, tying 2-2, and breaking the tie on the 1st tiebreak 54-51 (the 2nd tiebreak of resources was incidentally ties at 24).

Like most Decktet games the short deck makes the game move along to completion- definitely under an hour to play.

Players either develop a card fully (pay for it then), buy a deed (put down a down payment, and develop it with free actions as resources are collected), or sell a card from their hand by discrding it and collecting resources.

When a card is played it must match a suit on one of 5 starting cards, and is played on the player's own side of the starter. Additional cards can be added but must also match at least one suit.

After twice through the deck the game ends, players determine which starter cards they have won by the values of cards fully developed, rather like Schotten-Totten/Battle Line.

This combines two or three very clever uses of Decktet suits with proven area-control style games and resource collection and management. An execellent little game which I will start at 7, but which I would expect to go up with additional plays.

RATING: 8
Adding cards to help me get resources reminded me a bit of the SoC Card Game. The feeling I got from the game overall was similar to the one I get from Jaipur. At first, selling a card seemed like a letdown, until I understood how it could help me. It seems I have a gift for rolling tens in this game, which was helpful. Also, getting more cubes as more cards are in play helps the game to ramp up nicely, and two-times-through-the-deck is a good timing mechanism. Enjoyable. Both of us look forward to playing again.

Played once so far and I like it. There's a decent bit of strategy here. A bit like Battle Line or Lost Cities in that you vie for control of territories, with a dash of Settlers thrown in via the resource generation through territories and die rolls.

I've played over 20 times now, and I still enjoy it. Really an interesting game of hand and resource management. A good choice when you have only two players. I think you could probably add another deck to bring this up to 3/4 players.

I had a very nice Decktet printed at artscow, at ....../gallery/playing-cards/The-Decktet-8a1y20i7kspe  , and now we've happily played Magnate 25 times and likely will keep on playing sometimes.  

If you like Battle Line, try Magnate.

RATING: 7
A fun, quick card game with a nice balance of chance and strategy.  If Battle Line and Settlers had a love child (or, better yet, a rightful heir) it would be named Magnate.

Collect resources via dice and square-off for various districts by purchasing and playing numbered cards... which, in turn, provide the opportunity for further resources.

Very clever and definitely deserves attention from publishers (not that it isn't a lot of fun to play using the Decktet!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I found Magnate a fun affair when I played it a few times one afternoon.  It is a good two-player game of controlling resources, with a shifting flow of control as the game progresses.  I'd like to play it again to determine whether my rating/impression shifts up or down but I've got to refresh myself on the rules.

The main complaint I had at the time is that it required extra components besides the base Decktet, meaning you've got to keep some counters and a few d10s lying around close to the Decktet, which sort of takes away from the portability factor of the Decktet -- that said, this is not factored into the rating of THIS game alone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a gem of a two-player game and like others have said it deserves to be published on its own.

After a good number of plays the game starts to feel more luck dependent. I almost feel like it hits an odd gap between simple and complex. It's "fiddly" enough that I wish it were a little more strategic but short enough that I wish it were less "fiddly." While we still enjoy it I would almost rather play Lost Cities since it is so much simpler to play or Jambo/Race for the Galaxy if I wanted something a little more. 

All in all though for 40+ plays this is doing very well.

Played a few games now.  Overall, I like it quite a bit.  My wife took to it right away and likes it a lot as well!  Similar to Lost Cities, Scarab Lords, Battle Line, and other games where players compete for points in seperate columns.  But combines a great economic-engine resource building aspect as well.

What a cool game! This game is greater than the sum of its parts. There are 5 VP to fight for, and each one is a tug-of-war of sorts, reminiscent of Battle Line. There are interesting risks and rewards, such as the cheap cards that will help a little in the tug of war and are easy to play but will rarely produce vs the expensive cards which are tough to play, but should produce more frequently. There's a bit of playing the odds of the dice a la Settlers of Catan, but the swings in fortune don't feel as big here.

With Magnate alone, my Decktet has already earned its $3 price tag and more.

It's a good game, though I prefer other two player card games. The dice rolling slows it down a bit, and though I've only played once, I never really feared the Taxman. It's a neat combination of mechanics, though.

What a great little game! I love the way it combines the resource paying and gathering of the Catan Card Game (but with a proper non-uniform probability distribution restored) with the card tracking and positional decisions of Battle Line. I'm not yet using nearly all of the information available, but it's great fun anyway.

I haven't played many Decktet games since acquiring my deck, but this one ROCKS.  My wife and I enjoy playing this one very much, and it goes over just as well as a two-player lunch game with friends at work.  Too bad it's only two-player and has to compete for table time with Summoner Wars there, but still - great game!

I enjoyed this game a lot.  It's like Battleline but here, there are 5VPs to fight for.  The addition earning income for the cards you have played is very clever.  I'm not sure how much luck plays a part... more plays are needed to get a better sense of this

I 'own' this because I printed a Decktet deck.

My rating for this might go up. It's a lot of fun. My only concern is that the game plays so tight that the winner could be often determined by lucky draws or dice rolls. More plays will help get a better sense of this.

Neat game, but I think that the die rolls have way too much impact on each player's success.  Sometimes you'll have a hand full of cards that don't let you accomplish anything, and sometimes you can pay for a rank 9 card with no problem.

I'm enjoying Magnate. I will say I started to feel the frustration of bad dice rolls early on, however. In my first two games, in fact. 

I tried a variant that felt like it helped in my second game. For now--I need to test it further--I recommend using the variant where you remove the aces and use them as the card to determine your starting resources. Shuffle the resource cards (I forgot what they're called at the moment) into the deck and consider them a 15 for building purposes. As you work on the property while its still a deed, you get +5 to your strength for every 5 resources you allocate on the card. 

This seemed to help the game by adding some versatility to a card and essentially adding more tactical/strategic decisions to the game.

I rate it a 7.5 after three plays. If the rest of my games with the variant go as the third game went, I suspect I'll raise my rating to an 8 soon.

UPDATE, 12/24/11 - I was wrong. I'll probably be keeping it at a 7.5. After another play where I felt the outcome was almost totally controlled by dice rolls and card draws, I feel like this game doesn't offer the kind of control I like in a game. It still has a place in my collection, just probably not one I'm going to be thinking about much in between plays.

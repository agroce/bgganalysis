RATING: 6
Great theme. Somewhat fiddly and poorly fitting parts. Seems a little 'unbalanced' ? There is almost no reason to place the small moaia as the 'multiplier' effect of the larger ones is a big mathematical advantage. And working on a path to an extreme end of the island seems like a waste of time/resources. large Moaia placed near the quarry looks like the best strategy. Seems to have 1 or 2 superfluous mechanisms. The Rongo tablets for instance. Why not just bid tribal masks to upgrade your Chief to Witch Doctor? Perhaps with some variants or house rules, it could be made smoother. It definitely is slow for noobs, but never gets really moving even later in the game. Plenty of waiting for other players. I generally liked the 'bidding' mechanic in which you cripple yourself. And the use of other player's pathways. I would definitely play it again if someone asked, but might not buy it.

Worker placement and transport that depends on networks of most or all players scratching each other's back to get moai (Easter Island statues) transported from quarry to coastline placements. Auctions to get things underway. Fun!

It felt pretty tedious to me.  There were quite a lot of rules for this "family game" and it felt fiddly.  And it went 45 minutes longer than it probably should have.  That having been said, it was gorgeous.  Well, except for the hats and caps for the things that kept falling off...

Divertido juego con mecánicas y theme muy relacionadas, que consigue un conjunto precioso. Se basa en aprovechar los caminos de los contricantes con cuidado para no otorgarles muchos puntos, pero lo suficiente para servir a tus transportes y lograr la mayor cantidad de moàis.

1st play: I picked this up from the End Game auction for $5 or something, and I figured with it being a Matagot game, how could I go wrong.  I'm glad I did.  This one has a unique theme, beautiful on the table and was enjoyable.  At the beginning it's not clear how you're going to move these giant stones across the island, but by the end, you're carting these things all over the island.  Really a cool route building game that forces cooperation in a unique way.  

2nd play: Coming into the game having a better idea of what to do and this game got better.  Working with/against each other to move giant statues across the island creates interesting dynamics and opportunities to mess up the best laid plans.

RATING: 7
Giants features blind bidding (an interesting system in that you simultaneously bid for order in choosing and for the size of Moai that you will sculpt), worker placement and a semi-cooperative system in which you can use other players' workers to shift your Moai, but pay them vps in return. These systems combine in quite a distinctive, highly interactive and engrossing way. 

The game seems nicely thematic, with logs from the island's single forest a finite commodity and the map apparently quite accurate. The rules all seem to make logical, thematic sense.

Just one concern after four plays:  It is easy to find yourself frozen out of a high scoring set of placements and moves if your plans are not in sync with those of your opponents.  Doing your own thing is not a good place to be in Giants.  I'm not sure about the degree to which this is preventable by careful planning.

The production and artwork by Matagot are both to a very high standard.

Nice pick up and deliver eurogame. I liked the theme and the colourfull board. Nice components. The statues are awesome. Its very interesting that the board resets each round so you have to build again the routes for moving the statues from the quarry to the beach. The game also includes a double blind bidding mechanism. I am not sure if this game has a lot of replayability.

RATING: 8.9
Mechanically, this is a VERY good game.  It is well-balanced and has multiple paths to victory.  There are plenty of tough, meaningful choices to satisfy any "gamer," yet the game mechanics are simple enough that the game could serve as a "second-level" gateway game (i.e. it's a step up from classic gateway games like Ticket to Ride and Settlers of Catan).  The cool theme and awesome production value is the "icing on the cake."  I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a while!

Matagot's 2nd big box game is a nice follow-up.  The game play is a nice twist on individual planning and forced cooperation.  The latter really makes the game shine.  Players have to assist each other and in doing so, score points, but it is a tough struggle to decide if helping someone will result in the return happening.  This is all decided by essentially worker placement.  But it is done in a way that there is a little element of bluff and tipping of the hand that must be balanced.  The game is well made and evokes its theme nicely when seen on the table.

RATING: 8
Comment after one play. Rather impressed by this. After the first turn, I was somewhat underwhelmed as most players bought extra resources or low value Moais and not much else happened. But from the second turn things erupted in competition for the best Maois and plinths. What I particularly enjoyed was how different each turn was, with different paths of ant-like workers crossing the island in different directions, and the fact that you might want to change your own direction to take advantage of what others are doing. This is a game with high levels of player interaction, and little down time, and looks beautiful. Keen to play again.
I would echo a point made elsewhere though that I wouldn't come to the table cold with this: at least one player should have played before or fully read the rules. It's not that the game is difficult (though it is full of intriguing decisions), it's just that picking it up straight from the rulebook is not easy.
Update: Increased my rating from 7 after further plays. There is lovely depth to this game and a great deal of interesting decisions to be made.

I enjoyed my first game with 5 players and was a bit underwhelmed the next time with 4. The co-op element in the movement phase is interesting (similar to Magnum Sal). You don't get anywhere if you try to move your statues by yourself but you also don't want to give too many points to others. Finding the right timing when to move several high point statues to spots you just claimed and your opponents thought secured for them is one of the highlights of this game.

RATING: 6.5
First play: Has to be written off as a steep learning curve owing to the gaps in the rules (as explained not in the rule book) which omitted some fairly crucial gems of information and some downright ludicrous moves by me. The mechanic and flow needs a dummy round with objective commentary to stand half a chance of making a meaningful impression on the game.

Coming out the other side and this is a clever game, the mechanism is neat although the game could do with better player aids and a points scoring summary for new comers.

I'd prefer wooden pieces to the molded plastic men although the heads are neat.

Not really tempted to buy but I would like to play again.

Second Play: Yes its definitely a clever game but some how there is something missing that prevents me from wanting to buy it. At least I bought a hat this time.

Very seldom am I so absolutely stumped when I try to explain why I don't like a game.  Giants is certainly an anomaly in that way.  I mean, I haven't minded other games with similar mechanisms, but there just seemed to be something lacking here.  The components are absolutely top-notch, and the art is excellent as well.  I was just amazed with how hefty those little statues are.  And I like the idea of having 2 closed-hand bids at the same time.  I even won my 1 game by a decent amount, so why didn't I love the game?

Well, one thing I can say for certain is that I felt the game was much too long for the fun it offered.  About halfway through I was getting ready to wrap things up.  It also seemed like a player, like me, who just raced to a fast ending would be unbeatable (admittedly one game isn't enough to know this for sure.)  The only other thing I can point my finger at is that I seemed to feel annoyed that we just had to leave things sitting half-delivered on the board from one turn to the next.  I guess I just don't like an unfinished task.  All in all, it was a decent game that I would consider playing again, but I don't need my own copy.

Egyedi játékmenet, de nem az előretervezés mintapéldája. A döntések nagyban függenek az előttünk lépőktől. Nehéz a saját stratégiát kivitelezni, hisz mások erőforrásait is kell használni, mely csak akkor dől el, mikor meglépte az előttünk lévő.
Gyönyörűen kivitelezett tábla, a grafikával sincs gond, de a műanyag öntött alkatrészek hagynak kívánni valót maguk után. Például a szobra bármit is rátenni nagyon nehéz, mert nem elég jól passzolnak az alkatrészek egymáshoz.

Great looking game! Neat auction mechanic for gaining priority for crafting moais, coupled with a quicl bit of resource gathering / worker placement to get extra workers, logs and "hats". There's a co-operative aspect to placing workers to transport the moais around the island, but that's not to say that there's not a sudden cut-throat aspect to grab the best spots for yourself.

Then there's the hidden scoring as well, plus a memory aspect when you have to remember which moais are yours, so you don't put a hat on the wrong one!

Played once, great fun. Everyone playing said they were really enjoying it before we knew who had won. Which was me. Hurrah!

Played 3 times now, have won more than I have lost, but giants is one of those games where the look of the game adds to the fun and the thinking involved, so you don't really mind who wins!

Conseguido en Mathtrade de BSK inverno 2014. Enviado por Xabieret en Febrero 2014.

Juego de construir moais. Hay que llevarlos a su ubicación y si se puede, adonarlos con un tocado, para conseguir la mejor puntuación. Durante el juego, se pueden usar trabajadores de otros jugadores para transportarlos. Está bien. Es de colocación de trabajadores, pero no sobre acciones, que es lo habitual. Un pick and deliver interesante. perfectamente válido para no jugones.

Vendido el 4/12/2014 en la bsk, a rellenin junto a un In the year of the dragon por 41€. Chollazo. Se fue solo con una partida. PEnita me dio.

One player said this was a "train" game of pick up and deliver, which is a simplified way of describing the transportation aspect for movement of the Moia. But the actual transportation mechanic is somewhat different with the necessary cooperation element, and there is an auction mechanic that involves some real planning ahead for the whole turn, as the placement and transport phase will be impacted by the elements committed to bidding for Moia. And the Moia! Great bits here, and when they are all set at the beaches at the end of the game it is a sight to behold. There are plenty of tactical decisions to weigh in moving Moia to their set-ups on the beach - who to give points to, how many workers to commit, using Chiefs or Scorcerors or logs... Brilliantly designed transport and deliver mechanic, as it is wonderfully produced, with very thematic elements. A fun, challenging gaming session, if you have the right players - at which time this shines as a solid 10. Truly a gamer's game.

A gorgeously produced game - one of THE most beautiful I have ever seen. High quality components that evoke the ambience. Anything but a pasted-on theme. As someone who has been to Easter Island, I love how the game was completely built around the theme.

Pick-up-and-deliver is usually not a genre that I am fond of but this one breaks that mold. The game is more tactical than long term strategy. It's quite a lot of fun nevertheless. Our first initial game was very balanced. There were only 2 points that separated the 3 players.

I'd normally rate this a 7 but the top notch presentation bumps it to an 7.5.

RATING: 7.5
Only played twice. Nice worker placement game where you bid for control (using up the workers you have available for this turn) and then try to build Easter Island statues and carry them to the coast. Well-balanced and plenty of interesting decisions each turn. Using other peoples workers gives them victory points and the locations are balanced so that the further you carry the statue (or their hat) the more points it's worth.

Maybe I'm just becoming a grumpy old man, but after a single enormous play of this I don't have any large urge to play this huge game again. 

The art is gorgeous, and the pieces beyond what one would expect, but the game is largely an exercise in somewhat confusing rules.

The fact that it is singularly unmemorable since I played it and wrote these comments would seem to indicate that there won't be much more of this game "a head" of us.

Typically French - a very chromy, overwrought theme overlaying not-terribly-evocative and extremely tactical game mechanics.

Very well put together game!  I can really see how there could be quite a few different strategies, and it made me think quite a bit about the game afterwards.  My only complaints would be that the rulebook is pretty poorly written, and the game takes a little too long.  Based on some recommendations here on the Geek, we started with 2 workers each instead of the 1 that the rules says to start with, and I don't think I'd play it any other way.  It seems like the game would start out painfully slow otherwise.

RATING: 6
Not a huge fan of bind bid. But it's harmless enough if played with non-serious gamers. E.g. family. The laying out of workers is the main part of the game, but feels a bit processional. Still, I like the idea of producing statues and hats and trying to get them to their bases. But it wouldn't make the cut for a gamer's game.

RATING: 5
First game in, 3 players: a deception. The game took too long owing to our defensive mode of play which saw little cooperation and too much groupthink in purchasing and then transporting large statues. Instead of a quick game, it lasted nearly three times its promised length, and that is something the system cannot support.

I did feel that a number of our problems could be attributed to the low player number. The board is simply too big to allow transportation of valuable Moai over large distances. It takes to much effort since players need to spread themselves rather thin. With more players I hope that there are more meeples on the board and that the Nash equilibria function more smoothly. Right now they felt more or less hammered into place rather than elegantly emerging from the way players needed to move about. However, if the board is too big then with 3 players play is rather scripted and thus boring. I would not be at all surprised if a variant which allowed for a 4th neutral and jointly operated player markedly improved upon matters.

[b]Update[/b] I played a few times with 4 and 5 players, and the game improves noticably because of the larger amount of player pawns on the board. 3 players is simply not a very good number: you need more. But to say that the game improves to the point where it plays with a deceptive combination of smoothness and depth (like Utopia)... No. The structure of multiplexing the various game elements loses its bite once moai and hats can get transported 3/4rds of the way in one turn, and because everyone faces the same problems in increasing the movement options there is not really a way to easily diversify your strategy by for example focussing on helping transport along. Players will in this case just do a whambamthankyoumam and claim expensive ahus which greatly outweigh the cost of transport. Because unclaimed hats and moai can be reclaimed by anyone it doesn't make sense either to do a quick strategy as opposed to a slow one. Everyone develops in roughly the same manner, resulting in a bit of a boring calculating shuffle in which the only decision is whether to go for a few tall moai or a lot of small ones. The lack of variety means that this game is losing its appeal for me. I don't really see where the [i]game[/i] is, and what tradeoffs are forced upon me as a player—and if these tradeoffs are in working out the sums of moai_height * multiplier + hat_bonus - transport_costs, then... I think a computer could do this much better. This game is going to be sold off in the future, I fear.

[b]Update 2[/b] It took a good while longer than anticipated, but the game was let go.

(Based on 1 unfinished solo run through) Game play felt not as streamlined as other pickup-and-delivery games such as Bombay or Serenissima. Melting auction, worker placement, route building and other mechanisms felt a little overwhelming. +1 for top-notch component quality. Obviously with more complexity comes more strategy and replayability, but it requires more dedicated plays before it clicks.

Initially thought this was a fun game with very nice pieces. But after a couple of plays started to see how viscously it could be played. Now I am coming to see it as a serious gamers game with the ability to mightily screw up your opponents plans. Still very pretty to look at too.

Played once with 5, once with 4, and once with 3. Lots of player interaction that includes auctioning for statues (or moai), pick up and deliver (similar to rail placement of AoS or Steam),and the potential to "steal" the best placement spot (ahu) from your opponent before she does. 

And what a great visual presentation by game end! Wonderful components really add to the theme and enjoyment of this game. Disappointing at the same time in that the tribal markers and headstones don't often fit the moais properly, making for an unnecessarily fiddly game. I will try the "hot water treatment" to the plastic tribal markers to see if that fixes them. 

Prefer using the following variant: 
No memory aspect. Ahu bases placed face up. No need to break a Rongo tablet to look at ahus. Therefore, instead of full Rongo tablets being worth 0 VPs, they are worth 1 VP (per pair, or full tablet). It worked very well. Rongo tablets were still used frequently with the chief and still offered a few VPs for remaining ones at game end.

Excellent game materials, typical Matagot production.

Giants is a not too complex game involving bidding, movement and workers placement. The movement phase is an interesting cooperative competition, since it is possible to use other players' resources. All the mechanics are cleverly melded together, while keeping faithful to the theme.

RATING: 8
Rating after 1 play. An interesting blend of other Euro mechanics, including blind auction, worker placement and what amounts to a train game. The more I thought about it afterwards, the more I liked it.

The train game analogy may seem strange, but really that's what's happening. You're placing your workers (laying tracks), you can use each other's workers (lines) to get your statue (train) home. Unlike a train game, however, not only do the tracks change every turn (because you can never be sure where players are going to put their workers), but their capacity changes as well which makes the game much more interesting.

This was my favorite game of the Gathering in 2009 for a while, but then it kept falling flat because there are a few rules that were difficult for people to remember.  That's too bad, because I think there are some really neat aspect to the game.

RATING: 7
Just another Euro really - good for those who can do the calculations for action/investment and return. The execution is pretty good though and the game does have a positional element, i.e. it's not just holding boxes for workers.

Lifted by great bits and it is a pleasant game - there really can't be too many games about building giant heads in the middle of the Pacific.

Solid game - Early turns feel a little predictable, but I like the mechanic of building off of other peoples strategies.  We play with the erected moais non-hidden.  Hidden trackable should not reward better memories.

RATING: 9
Players play a tribe of natives on Easter Island, dedicated to the sculpting, transport and erecting of giant statues (Moai).  Beautiful game containing some of the best "bits" seen in recent years - individual tribe miniature sculpts, three different sized Moai, wonderful (and accurate) map, and so on.  Game play is fun and engrossing - players bid to claim Moai from the quarry, then use a worker placement system to transport them out to the building sites on the perimeter of the island.  Once there they earn points, and even more if they're capped with a headress.  Little Moai are easy to sculpt and move, but earn few points.  The big boys, however, earn triple points but are a pain to move.  Ingenious transport rules allow you to use other player's workers to aid in the move, paying them a few points for the use.  So, tiny bit of everything here - auction, transport, resource allocation, cooperative gameplay, memory element, and even a slight touch of nastiness.  I was very, very impressed with the game, both the game play and the presentation of it.  One gripe is some of the headdresses and tribe markers don't quite fit on the Moai properly, so 10 minutes with an emery board is required to tune it up.  Other than that, excellent game.  Two player variant works very well.

I've only played it twice, but what a game! Despite getting crushed by the other players, I found everything about the game to be intriguing, thinky, or just plain pretty. Feels somehow very thematic, at least as regards the "cooperation" often necessary to get things done, and the deforestation of the island. The kind of game I'd be quite happy to own even if it only rarely could get to the table.

Rules revisions on BGG; also instructions for when hats & player markers don't fit the heads of the Maoi,  for molding with heat to fit. 

We all had different strategies to play.  The game can end very quickly, just when some players are gearing up to make some points.  60 mins is a close estimate.  Rules are easy to grasp.  Components unique and board is attractive. The game is accurately thematic. 

I played with a full 5 people and don't think the game would be nearly as much fun with less.  All voted to play with bases turned up.

I dislike player screens, and like most, these easily fall over, especially since you have to flag your screen upon passing.  I will provide bowls where players can put their pieces, which they will still keep behind their screen. 

I am looking forward to testing several strategies.

RATING: 7
The board and components look fantastic.  If one can be critical about them, it's that the tribal markers are difficult to fit and don't actually click onto the size 3 statues.  The headresses don't fit at all either.

Gameplay is a mixture of simultaneous (dual) auction and a type of pick up and deliver.  It can be fiddly - Knocking over several pieces domino style can be annoying.  There are one or two minor rules which are often forgotten such as removing the 'end of action round pass marker' making if difficult to evaluate oppenents moves whilst in that phase.  

If all of the above sounds more negative than positive then I apologise as I really like this game.  It looks great, and when played with gamers who know the game and rules then it will flow nicely.

RATING: 6
Some fun aspects. The blind bidding is not critical, so it plays nice and smooth, allowing good trade-offs between efficiency and flexibility. The worker placement is interesting too, and trying to benefit from other's routes is key. The memory aspect is plain dumb, but fortunately the game works flawlessly without it.

This could be a good game, so what kills it? In my opinion, it is way too long and repetitive, with end-game conditions that are long to come by and makes the game drag. (At least with 3 players.) Moreover, the point-giving system allows a lot of freedom regarding which player will receive the points, and a bad evaluation of who's ahead can throw the game one way or the other. All in all some good ideas, but the game would have benefited from more development.

Regarding the material: it is quite nice and the box is packed full of it. Unfortunately, the gameplay ask for some assembly that just doesn't work (fit the headrests or the markers to the moai? Attach the flag to the player screen?) So it is quite cumbersome.

Egy gyönyörűen kivitelezett, iszonyat hangulatos játék. A játékosok a Húsvét szigeteken építenek hatalmas szobrokat, és ehhez szereznek embereket, fát. A körök elején egy jól eltalált licitálós rész van, ami nagyon sok gondolkodásra serkenti az embert. Ezután emberke lerakosgatás következik, aminek az a pikantériája, hogy a szobrok mozgatásához mindenki mindenkinek az embereit használhatja. Emiatt rengeteget kell a játékban a másik fejével gondolkodni. A tematika szuper, nagyon bele tudja magát élni az ember a játék történetébe.

RATING: 5
Looks like: a totally overproduced pile of plastic miniatures, unfortunately rather dysfunctional. Plays like: a one-track Winsome train game. 

Players try to erect the giant Moais at the most prestigious building sites on the island. The major challenge is that the statues need to be transported there, and the heavier and more valuable the statue the more difficult it is to get it there. That's where the other players come in because you can borrow their transport capacity for a share of the victory points. While that sounds pretty good so far, the problem is that while lending your bearers to other players can make the difference in a tight game it is not sufficient to be a strategy of its own.

Since erecting statues simply scores much better there is very little diversity in the game. The only real tradeoff is whether to go far many small or few big statues, and since everything can go everywhere preventing someone from using your infrastructure (or enticing them to prefer your bearers to someone else's) is a rather impossible proposition.

Some nice ideas but does not manage to tap its full potential.

Hands-down the best-looking game in my collection, Giants is a fun game about erecting Moai on Easter Island.

The game has a great theme and a good mechanic. The components are nice, but unplayable, which make the play sometimes hopeless. If you at least had a flat head on the moais and headdresses so you could balance the tribe markers. Sometimes it also was to many pieces in a single hex on the board and when it fell down it became very messy. I'm sorry that a good game failed on the components this way and I'm glad that I could try it before buying it.

This game was far different than I was expecting—much heavier and more tactical.  The pieces are very pretty (and sadly not as functional as beautiful), but underneath all that there's a lot to analyze and optimize.  It reminded me of Tikal a bit, even though there's very few similarities in gameplay.  One hour was a drastic understatement, at least for a first game; our first four-player game was a solid two hours.  With more experience things would go faster, but there's still a lot to take in.

There are multiple paths to victory points in this resource management game, which is a good thing. There are also a lot of little trade-offs of using opponents' resources but giving them points. Overall, it's a pretty good balance, but for some reason it just didn't wow me. There's nothing wrong with it, but nothing really made me want to come back for another try.

It has pretty over the top production values, and is generally very nice to look at.

A solid design with an interesting mix of mechanics, a nice and well implemented theme, gorgeous components and very enjoyable gameplay. The transportation system is really good, with its different requirements for moais of different sizes, and the use of other players' men. All player's pieces have more than one possible use, and every turn you have to choose carefully what to do with them. The game features multiple viable strategies and is nicely balanced. There are usability issues with some components, but I really like the "rocky" appearance of the statues.

The choice of when and how to help people, while not relying on others was a good balance.

It all fit together well.

A weird hybrid of pick-up and deliver, blind bidding, and pseudo-worker placement. It seems that a minor miscalculation or misplay can hose you considerably, and misplays can occur merely due to a tiny error in guessing what your opponents will do. Also, waaaaay too long.

RATING: 5.5
While it's not a bad game, everyone at the table found it very boring and extremely annoying, due to those Moais and all of their "headsets". The material may be very nice looking, but it hampers the gameplay.

A decent but not great combo of delivery and worker placement.  The bidding mechanism seems clunky and it could have done without the memory component. Also needs more thorough tiebreakers.  We ties and has the same number of half tablets.

A relatively simple game of bidding for commodities (moais) and then delivering them to a destination, that's just slightly reminiscent of Age of Steam. Some nasty tactics are possible in the auction, but even if you don't get a moai you're not left bereft of options as you can position your workers to poach some VPs while hopefully also delivering a 'hat'. I normally rave about wood components, but here are some of the best plastic bits I've seen in a game. It can be a bit long (ignore the 60 minute playing time, it can run to twice that)  as players are not obliged to bid for extra moais and delivering a certain number is the game end condition. Overall it doesn't quite have that certain 'spark' that makes a game purchaseable for me, but I'm happy to play.

Based on one play with four players. Very interesting blend of mechanics.  Really like the balance and well-integrated theme. Need to play again to see if it can play faster.  As others have noted the 60 min. on the box seems a bit low.  If playtime can be kept to 75 min or less my rating will go up. I can see why it might not be as good with 3 players.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Shared temporary networks for pickup and delivery is a really cool mechanic that leads to lots of semicooperative player interaction. You don't want to be off placing stuff away from all the other players; you want to get some points from them delivering stuff using your workers, but you really want to try to set things up so that you can get better placements for your moais using their workers. The tactic of spending a tribal marker to not only get a rongo half-tablet but also get to "wait things out" for one more turn is great, and I'm glad the rulebook highlighted it. This would be a really good game even it wasn't gorgeous.

[b]Components:[/b] This game is gorgeous. The moais are what catch your eye, but the art on the board and the player screens is amazing. Sure, some of the moais are wobbly--which I fixed by taking a chef's nice to the wobbly ones and scraping the bottom flat--and the tribal markers don't fit on top of the moais as well as the headdresses do. But c'mon, this game is *gorgeous.* This is the kind of game that, back in the day, we'd create house rules for if the game underneath wasn't that great, just because we liked the bits so much. But the game here is really really good!

[b]Game Length:[/b] Here's the rub. BGG has the playing time as 60 minutes, but I think that is a ridiculous underestimate. 2+ hours is more like it. So that's a bummer.

RATING: 7.5
I quite liked my first playing of the game with 3 players and see that probably 3 or 4 will be best, 5 might even work good, will find out soon. 

The game is completely built around the theme and as such makes it very enjoyable to play. You really do feel like you are helping to build the island up by moving around and erecting the Moai, this also makes learning the game very easy.   

Gameplay was pretty good overall, a p/u and del game at heart (actually no pick up, just delivery with emphasis on route planning) where efficiency is the name of the game. No luck in the game which is great, there is a blind bid for the Moai that concerned me at first but overall I thought it was good. Some good planning is required to be efficient especially concerning your routes and resources, you can plan maybe one turn ahead but probably not much more and at any rate there is enough to think about here to keep you interested but not a brainburner (read around midweight). Dont get mislead on any "worker placement" references, you are putting guys down but mostly to "build a network", this is NOT another worker placement game (thank goodness).   

There is some co-op effect here and if you get left out like I did, you will miss out on some good points. This could be open to tabletalk and you'll have to decide in your group whether to allow open table talk cooperation/alliances or not, should be fine both ways.   

The components are gorgeous no doubt and top notch but two niggles, the hats dont fit on all Moai and the 1 and 2 Moais are too close in size and colour. I recommend to put a small elastic on the 2's and file the heads or hats accordingly. Other than that the game really looks awesome throughout play and when finished. 

2 "possible" slight concerns on gameplay - one is the lack of strategic exploration, there are slightly different paths to take but I dont think one is really better than the other overall, just my initial impression (grain of salt here please) so I think overall replay will suffer a little from lack of depth but it will still be a fun game to own and play occasionally and I would like to own it. One other thing is the endgame COULD, not for sure, be prone to just slight kingmaking if you are able to calculate the score (especially w/o the memory element). These are only perceived niggles here and not confirmed by any means.  

Seems like the different strategies are quite balanced and between 2 games in our group the scores were around 100 and all players within 5 points. I really liked that the points were based on EXACTLY how far the places were which meant not having to calculate for that. 

[u]UPDATE[/u] - 4 is a great number for this, probably best. Sometimes when only a couple Moai are up for grabs the auctions will be tight and a loser may make payment and get nothing in return, usually I frown on this quite heavily but so far I'm okay with it here. There is definitely a psychology element in the auction where you really have to anticipate what the other players are going to bid, it seems the game can be won or lost in these auctions although a crafty road builder (ala Mahajara) can clean up on some nice points in some rounds. Chalk up yet another game where everyone was right at 100 and all 4 players were within 5 points. Here's another game where winning will come down to the "little things".  

My suggestion is play the new rule where the tablets score nothing at the endgame. 

[b]Tidbits[/b]

[u]Game length[/u] - IS variable, simply give each player less "bases" and the game will be shorter with NO other effect at all. 

[u]Slow start[/u] - You can start with an extra worker and marker each no problem. 

[u]Memory element[/u] - Simply play without it but realize that all points will now be open info and easily calculated. This can be good or bad depending on group. 

Note that these are really just little variants and we played without them and I liked the game a good bit, the length would be my first tweak though.

Well, that was a better experience than I would have thought, given Matagot's track record so far. I found Giants to be quite a decent game, with nice components and intriguing gameplay. The game is quite unforgiving, and mistakes may not only waste you a turn, it might also give the first player next turn a significant advantage for free.

Other than that, there is much to like here.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2012)

What a surprise. This game has been a roller coaster for me.  I initially wanted to play Giants, but as soon I found out the game was about Easter Island I almost balked out as (due to the name) I have pictured another (more exciting) theme. At the end I played the game and I’m very glad I did, this is a very good game (but I’m not crazy about the theme :D).

The components are really nice and the game board looks gorgeous with all the Moaïs on it although some of the headdresses don’t fit properly on the Moaï :S.

The game has a lot of interesting and hard decisions, lots of opportunities to screw your neighbor, lots of interaction and negotiations (about the transport network), biddings and it even has a memory element (which I love and I refuse to play without it). I really liked the way the transport of the Moaïs is done, it feels a lot like Indonesia. Another aspect I appreciate is that the game has a low luck level.

On the bad side, I feel the game begins a little slow AND it can take a loooong time to play.

Bottom line, I’m impressed about this game and I want to play again soon.

After more plays, I realize the game can end much more quicker than I initially though. The game length depends on the players´ strategy. You can have few points but if you end the game quickly, perhaps you can win. I love this feature. I no longer feel the game is very long.

One 5 player game only

Takes some Euro staples (there's a blind-bid auction each turn, and worker placement too) but adds in a spatial, network-building element with some cool movement rules around the statues and their hats (yes, that's statues with hats).

The network building is made more interesting through it being cleared down and started afresh each turn - can you deliver to the coast the statues/hats you want this turn, or must you plan on leaving them mid-journey inland, which is not without risk?

I imagine it would be less important with smaller numbers of players, but that your network can be used by your competitors (and vice versa) means that you have to look to build mutually beneficial routes that favour you and maybe one (but not all) of the others.

Interesting game, and very nicely produced.

I REALLY wanted to like this game and got to play it at ORIGINS 09. The game is beautifull with lots of cool bits and miniatures. The 5 tribes are all in different poses and the 3 different types of statues look like rock. The problem was that the rules were not intuitive and either was the game play which immedietally told me it would be hard to get friends to play. It took continuing turns to move the statues and you constantly give other players points by using their tribes (so you can pick who you want to help or screw over). It was just too "fiddly" for me and I resisted the temptation to buy it for the cool minis.

This game is an underrated gem.  It's a fascinating blend of cooperation and competition, with lots of player interaction, alliance formation, and reading the goals of others.  It generates excellent tension because you never have enough resources to do quite what you want.  The presentation is fantastic, too, lending the game a highly thematic feel.  It's a two-hour affair for gamers, but well worth it.

I like these variants: place moai bases face-up and start with 2 workers and 3 markers.

Beautiful game. Worth playing once, but I don't think that the game is variable enough to sustain repeated plays. The game is about moving statues and stone headresses across Easter Island from their quarries to their installations. The further you move it the more points it is worth. Gaining of resources and workers is slow. You want to maximize movement of multiple pieces along single or shared routes. AP prone players can take a long time with this one. Interesting theme. Good game play. Not great, though. Game play gets a 6. The extra point is for the art direction!

Interesting game. Mechanically it is a route building game with a piggy-back element. Players using one another to progress their Moai across the board to a final spot wherein points are scored. Ostensibly the game is about the Rapanui of Easter Island building and moving their Moai from quarries to their Ahus. While the theme comes through and the bits are quite lovely, the game itself is somewhat repetitive with no lasting player alliances. 

If you really love route building, components, a nice implementation of theme, and are looking for lighter fare than Giants fits well. Those looking for a deeper, more cutting experience are advised to look elsewhere.

Giants is an odd mix of gorgeous components and rather dry gameplay. It's probably unique that a game with miniatures features leaching off points from other players by helping them with transporting goods, i.e. Moai and their hats. The latter is slightly reminiscent of Age of Steam although the 'routes' will be demolished each new round reducing the importance of board position. Nonetheless, it features interesting tradeoffs where to use resources, e.g. spending in the initial Moai auction vs. using saved resources to increase movement potential in the later transport stage or further building up future resources. My one concern with the game is replayability as there's everything on the table in the first game already and I don't see any great new strategies to be discovered. Success in Giants is more an issue of creating subtle advantages through benefitting slightly more from your opponents than they are.

A very fast and simple goods-delivery game. Players bid on stones and try to move them along Easter Island. The gameplay was a little more shallow than I would've liked. Too simple. And a big part of the game is kingmaking (because you give VPs to other players for using their workers to move the stones). If there was more meat to the game, it would've definitely have made one of my favourites of the year.

Components are fabulous and fiddly. Artwork was brilliant, and each player's workers used a different sculpt which was amazing. But the hats kept falling off and the little logs kept rolling around.

I'm seldom telling you that a game is overproduced, but in the case of Giants you could have easily left out one punch board by printing some extra stuff on the unneeded areas of the huge board. The insert could also have been made more practical. The game itself is good, but a bit repetitive. The semicooperative element is nice. The auctions overall felt a bit bland, because there's seldom something that you absolutely need and towards the end they might become an anticlimax as nobody's bidding anymore. On the definitely positive note there might be quite many interesting strategic options available.

RATING: 7
Very interesting game about the period in which the Moai were raised on the Easter Island. What makes this game stand out is that there's a lot of interaction but no direct conflict. How does this work? In order to transport your Moai to the place where you want to raise them you place chains of workers transporting them along. But since every worker can do this multiple times per turn, you can also use your opponents workers. But every time you use an opponent's worker this opponent gets a victory point. So while being able to move your Moai much farther you will also give your opponents many points when you use their workers too often. And the production value is just amazing.

2015-05-09 - 7.5 - I really liked it. It has interesting mechanics with getting help from other players. The wizard and the chief add some variety during turns. I have never played this kind of game before. It is great visually and other guys were clearly interested in the game also because of it looks. It was a little bit too long, but maybe because it was our first game (4 players). We'll see if it changes in another game.

2015-09-26 - 7.5->8 - Finally we played Giants again and I'm keeping the game for now. It works well with three players too and seemed to be faster when we knew what we were doing, but I think we will always play "quick" version with two basic workers at the beggining of the game. 

Nice clean game with great looks.

2015-10-14 - 8->7.5 - After rethinking the rating it is strong 7.5.

2015-11-23 - 7.5->7 - I really like this game, but it takes 20 minutes too long, so I will not pick this one up as often as I would.

2016-09-05 - 7->7.5 - After another game I change the rating again and lets keep that for a while (as well as the game itself).

2017-02-20 - 7.5->7 - I guess it's final rating. I enjoy this game every time I play, but always it lasts a little too long. Thus it's not so easy to bring to the table and I guess I will get rid of it eventually.

2017-07-30 - 6.5 - That's more accurate.

In this game, players incarnate clan leaders during the Golden Age of Easter Island. The board represents a simplified map of the island. Rock platforms (ahus) are where the Moaïs (monumental sculptures) will be erected.

Your clan competes against others, and you will earn more prestige by building and transporting larger, more imposing Moaïs than your opponents' clans.

Note that there is a Official Rule Change for this game : For the final scoring, complete Rongo tablets are no longer scored and do not earn any points to the players.

Played twice.  3 players; 5 players.  Lots going on in this game.  There are many mechanics mashed together, but they mesh pretty well.  And the auction mechanism has a slight twist.  Plus, there are some very thematic touches to the game (e.g. deforestation).  The game is overproduced, however.  I like nice, solid bits, but these are over the top.  And the rule book needed one final fresh pair of eyes to go over it.

There is nothing that important which comes to my mind. I rated it 5 because I hate auctions, since they are always wrongly placed, and because it is not really an exciting game.

The mechanic where you must remember where are your statues is also weird but I cannot say it is a bad idea, it's just that you don't expect this from an euro game.

The player reference seemed pretty clear, but placing an removing the flag every time could damage the screen. But yes it is a good idea.

There's enough tension that you want to help others b/c they will also help you even though you're not sure what the final results will be on where they're building and which lot they'll claim.  It is very fiddly with many rule nuances, so there's a learning curve to it.

First of all: The memory element is just dumb, so we fortunately ignored that part and put the tiles face up.

There were some interesting aspects to the game: the pacing depending on the turn and which moais came out, the choice of bidding and use of shaman/chieftain, and the sharing of networks.

However, the last few turns were very dissatisfying as there's nothing to do while waiting for someone to build the last moai. There's also an aspect of giving points to those who are not the leader that I don't like (especially if you're not scoring moais as soon as they're built).

It would be a good 1-hour game, but it ran too long for what it was.

Rating based on one play. Better than expected, I really enjoyed the way the players build a "transport network" together, and do this again from scratch every round. There were several "aha"-moments throughout this first game, as possibilities to cooperate, leech and block became apparent, and as the value of workers and markers became more clear.

1 play 3-p. Meh. Will play once more. Rules are a trainwreck. Components are interesting - lots of plastic - but the QA is poor - hats/tribe markers seldom fit the moai. 

Bit of a drag with 3. More players may salvage this game for me. Initial impression - game rates somewhere between and 4 and 5 for 3-p. There are so many well done worker placement games already.

5.27.09 bumped up from 3 to 4. Not horrible, but not good. Not exactly average either. Didn't enjoy winning or losing. Bleh. Might try it again to humor friends who knew how to play.

This is a beautiful and clever game. You really need to play this starting with two workers to cut some time off gameplay. I also play where two half tablets equal three points and not the updated rules eliminating the points. Very rich in theme.

07/11/09 Played a three-player game once. It took longer than I thought it would. So the drudgery of lugging heavy stone objects across jungle terrain became a bit repetitive and tiresome. But not enough to put me off the game. However I do wonder how a five player game plays. Quicker, I hope. Oh, and I gave up early trying to snap those tribal markers on moias or make the hats stay on. If I couldn't get it to stay in the first 3 seconds I just tossed them at the game owner. He seemed to have a knack for it. That's good, because I was not going to waste anymore time on it. 
10/17/09 Another three-player game. 11/28/09 Finally got to play a four-player game. As I suspected a lot more using of other player's workers to move your own moais. Plus the "good" sites to raise them dry up quickly. 02/18/14 Played another four-player game.

I really like the board, the theme and the way the rules are laid out.  It's a fun family game that proves that the genre (board games) can still amaze us, and not just the hard core gamers.

Rendkívül hangulatos, egyedi mechanizmusú, optimálisan agyégetős játék. A játék dizájnja nagyon ott van.

Elképzeled, ahogy megelevenedik előtted a Húsvét-szigeteki őserdő, ahol a helyi törzs éppen egy óriási kőszobrot vontat hatalmas farönkök segítségével. Szinte hallod, ahogy az egyikük cifrán elkáromkodja magát, amint a lába a farönk alá csúszik és hallod, amint a törzsfőnök egy hatalmas ordítással mindezt elfojtja: Aaaaarrrghhhhhhh! (Ami annyit tesz: siessetek barmok, ha nem akartok kint éjszakázni a mérgeskígyókkal, sötétedésig ki kell érnetek az isteni szoborral a vízpartra!)

A játék nagyon jó, még a tematika is jól rásimul a mechanikára, ami valljuk meg, elég ritka.

A komponensek szépek, a szobrok és a törzstagok kifejezetten szemrevalók lettek, jó pakolgatni őket a táblán (ami szintén igényesen kivitelezett).

A dobozra - és a BGG-s adatlapjára írt - 3-5 játékost el lehet felejteni, mert kiváló kétszemélyes szabály íródott hozzá, amit sikerült is kipróbálni és tényleg meglepően jól működik.

Nem is értem, miért van ennyire alulértékelve a BGG-n...

Solid game with outstanding components.  Board and bits look great, and game play is very good.  I'd be happy to play this again, but I'm not interested in picking up this title.  The theme, although very well integrated, doesn't exactly grab me (building and moving Easter island statues).  Now mind you, that theme alone isn't the only criteria I use in selecting a game.  However, although the mechanics and decision making were good, they were nothing that excited me either.

The players are on Easter Island and your tribe must erect the biggest Moais on appropriately higher scoring Ahus.  The further the Ahu is from the quarry pit, the more points it will be worth.  The game has a bit of worker placement, bidding, pick-up, and delivery all rolled into it, and it does an ok job in keeping all mechanics interesting.

The production quality of this game is also amazing, the board is very colorful and pretty.  I did feel however, that the game felt sluggish.  Bidding for your Moais and than trying to get it delivered to the spot you want it felt tedious.  

I do feel like we got a few rules wrong, so I do owe this one another play, the rating right now will most likely go up when I can get it to the table again.

Unfortunatley can't try it out at home because we have only two gamelovers at home. I put it on the list to play it a.s.a.p. as I convinced, after try outs in Essen, its a well contructed game with body. Nicely presented, attractive grapfics, box full... and good they made some time to give a historical note on the Easter Island, of which I didn't know anything at all. So we even learn something by playing.

Build up your engine, use up some of your engine generated stuff in the blind bid for statues, use the rest to place on hexes to allow the statue(s) you've won to move from the quarries to the shoreline scoring positions. Statues come in 3 sizes, where sizes 2 and 3 generate double and triple points, but require 2 and 3 guys respectively to move them over each hex, so it takes longer, and the further you move them, the more points you score. The good news is that you can move your statue using other people's guys and give them some VPs as a thank you. It didn't take long for everyone to engine up, and after that it got a bit same-y unfortunately. Bid, place guys, move; bid, place guys, move. There's a few things you can try - just doing lots of little stuff and ending the game quickly vs getting big guys, and then either settling them quickly for lowish points and then getting more statues, or taking the time to move the big fellas across the island. There's a generate-hats-and-move-them sub-plot going on which follows much the same movement process for bonus points on your statues, and a de-forestation thing which is thematically nice, but that's about the extent of it. Even thought the game is interesting enough whilst playing, and the artwork and components look great, I felt I'd explored it after a single play.

Interesting mechanic, a game that you need to play more then once to get good at it. You bid with your pieces and money in the first phase and then you get to use what you have leftover in future phases. You also need to help others and be helped in order to get a lot of points. Slight learning curve, but worth it.

Scatola monumentale, bei componenti e grafica molto sopra la media accompagnano meccaniche non originalissime ma collaudate e care ai giocatori.
Nel gioco - ottimamente ambientato - spicca la catena umana per portare a dimora i Moai (e i loro buffi copricapo), che necessita una (remunerativa) cooperazione tra i giocatori.
Il gioco è ben bilanciato: difficile scolpire molti Moai e trasportarne tanti in un solo turno. Ovviamente conviene portare i Moai lontano dal punto di lavorazione e i copricapo lontani dalla cava: ma spesso è la catena umana che decide la dimora finale. Divertente.

This is one of those games where you really want to take advantage of what everyone else does.  So really stalling is a great tactic--if someone else allows movement through a particular space, you don't have to waste guys doing it yourself.  There's some difficult decisions about whether to build up resources for later or get stuff built now, made even more important by the player-activated game end condition.  Really the game can end quite suddenly when you're not expecting it.  The art and components are beautiful, but the design is horrible--hats and player markers won't stay on statues, statues fall over, and logs roll all over the place.  I wish they had focused on usability.

Giants has some interesting ideas like the semi-cooperative route building, and the fact that networks have width as well as length.

And the pieces, while beautiful, are not very functional.

Not a heavy game by any means. Does take considerably more planning than at first evident. He who makes use of other people's workers the best will usually win. Scores are tight and the types of scoring is well balanced. This game gets a slightly higher rating from me just for the production quality. This is by far the best looking game I have ever seen, just beautiful. And the theme is the game so it scores high marks for that as well. Wonderful game with both competative and co-operative elements.

Interesting delivery game of working cooperatively to try to max/min VP gain over opponents.  Game has a "hidden element" that really is fully trackable by those with memory - but the screens are useful to work out a move without telegraphing too much.  But one does need to telegraph a bit to see if others will help out.  Don't discount getting points as others use your trails, but the same benefit is a risk as you also bring others closer to stealing your desired VP locations.

But game is a lot of bid, place, move over and over until the end game condition is met.  Can run a bit long, especially if people stop to think how they will play out their moves.

I find this game very appealing. It has two main mechanics: pick-up and deliver, and a wonky blind bidding hybrid (bidding potential man-power for the current round that you get back at the beginning of the next). Strategy wise, I found the pick-up and deliver portion of the game to be deep and satisfying. You can capitalize off other's work at the cost of forfeited victory points, or blaze your own trail to deny opponents any extra points. The components and production values are astounding, and I truly mean astounding. Much like Cyclades, Matagot went above and beyond by crafting beautiful miniatures with unique molds for each player. Beautiful plastic Moai with red hats, and an amazingly illustrated board. I reckon the components alone will draw many gamers into giving it a try.

Probably best with more players due to the cooperative nature of movement and fewer Moaïs needing to be erected.

Gamers who like pick up and deliver games are probably going to enjoy this more than me. I'd have thought it'd appeal to the train game crowd with players paying you to use your track... ah, workers. There's a little auction using dual currency at the beginning of each turn, so the auction lovers should like that. Throw in a little bit of potential screwage in the auction resolution and worker placement and you'll find a few fans there. Wait, there's more - a little bit of memory, mainly so players can't accurately calculate scores. Worker placement... sure, there's a bit of that too.

There's definitely planning and smart moves to be made, but after you've made all the dumb moves in your first game you should have worked these out. Definitely worth a second play to see if you can string together all your plans and cunning ideas. And there are a few ideas worth trying out. Finally, if you factor in the lovely board and game bits and spot on theme, you have a perfectly pleasant family or light gamers game.

So, in summary:
It's nothing that'll blow you away. It's got a bit of everything. The components are terrific. It doesn't have a whole lot of legs, but for the odd play it'll keep you entertained as you try out a few tricks. Did I mention the lovely bits and theme?

RATING: 7
[i]Giants[/i] is a game in which players try to connect quarries to building sites in order to erect Moaïs together with their headdresses in the Eastern Island. The connections disappear turn after turn, nevertheless there is a chance to reclaim the pieces that didn't reach their destination, if the players have the appropriate markers to do so. Mostly, this is a game about short term planning, even when there is a space for a wider perspective. The production is beautiful, even when the bits are not very functional, and the theme is well integrated with the mechanics.

Roppant izgalmas a játék. Szinte az összes nyersanyagból hiányt szenved az ember, a nagy nehezen megszerzett Moai-t akár el is tudja veszíteni ha nem tudja időben egy kijelölt helyre eljuttatnia és nincs jelölője amivel jelezhetne annak tulajdonosát. Jól válaszd meg, hogy az embereidet hova helyezed el a táblán, mert ha más törzsek is igénybe veszik a fizikai erejét, akkor pontokat termel neked. A játék nagyon szép, a komponensek igényesek, egyetlen kis apró hibát lehet felróni, hogy a sapkákat és a jelölőket nagyon nehéz csatlakoztatni a Moai fejéhez. Matagot tavalyi játéka is tetszett (sokakkal ellentétben), de idén sikerült egy nagyot dobniuk.

The rules can be a little tough to teach because of co-operative nature of route building, and explaining the auction mechanic. Once this is understood over a couple rounds, it becomes more of a heavy thinking/positioning game.

The game play fits the theme very nicely.

[1 play] Pretty game. Has a Kramer-ish feel to the mechanics.

Here's what I think. Fabrice Besson set out to make a game about Easter Island, and he did a wonderful job incorporating the history, but that he was also consciously or subconsciously influenced by train games. I say that because if you strip away the theme and the bits (and I am NOT recommending you do that) you end up with a pick up and delivery game, and it is really quite a good game.

The bits are awesome and flawed at the same time. If I own this eventually, I will have to figure out a better system for the masks and the head dresses.

I am very eager to play this again. Donovan and I both made sub-optimal moves in the first turn which gave Corey a breakaway lead.

Nice mellow amorphous train game.  This really feels like something that Winsome would put out (only with the production blown out to the extreme vs not being a consideration.)  

I love the group that I play with because as soon as I mention that you had to remember whose statue is whose it was immediately disregarded.  What a lame rule.

This will probably never be an absolute favorite, but it is a real joy to play and watch unfold.

My only real complaint is the slow start.  This game needs a major jump start.  Next time I'll start where each player gets an extra worker, coin and a single Moai.

A wide mix of mechanisms that don't fit together very well. The cooperative Moai moving is the best part--stripped down, tuned, and given more thought, it would have made a fine game in its own right. The tribal markers are a particular mess because they don't stand for anything at all--they have three completely unrelated uses.

The pieces are beautiful but much too easy to knock over and scatter. Unless your entire group is surgeons and pianists stuff will get knocked over.

60 minutes is a reach, especially with the full 5 players, unless you have a group full of ADHD hummingbirds.

A compelling title whose intricacies are hardly apparent on the surface.

This is a very pretty game, with a cool Easter Island theme but ultimately not that interesting. It's a pick-up-and-deliver game where, in order to be most efficient, you have to work along with the other players. I think I would have enjoyed it more when we first got it. At this point, though there's too much competition for this kind of game! I guess I'd prefer:
- a bit more randomness in the game (other than the moai selection each round)
- less blind-bidding (I've never been a fan -- here, it can really screw players later in turn order!)
- less memory; I've never been a fan of that mechanism!
Also, the components look great but they're not exactly functional: the coins/headdresses don't fit on the moai, and the moai themselves are a bit wobbly.

I like pick-up-and-deliver, but this one falls a bit short for me.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There is a quarry in the center of the island, and several building sites worth various VP (according to distance) around the island edges. You start with a set of workers (mostly laborers, 1 chief, 1 witch doctor?). 

Each round starts with a blind simultaneous auction for the chance to acquire randomly drawn statues (small/medium/large = weight 1/2/3). You bid with workers (they have capacity to carry 1-3 weight of statue). Then, on each of your turns, you'll place a worker anywhere on the board (hex grid). When all workers have been placed, you can move the statues you acquired in the auction from the quarry to the build sites. If you stop short when moving moai, you can spend a coin to mark it as yours; leave it on that hex. Sites are acquired previously and marked with face down tokens; if you forget and build on someone else's site, they're the ones who will get the VP (as shown on the build site, multiplied by 1-3 according to moai size). If you use other player's workers to help move, they earn VP according to worker strength used. Your workers can also get you other things (some of which require your chief or witch doctor):
- wood, if they ended up in the forest (limited supply). During the worker placement step, wood logs can be placed in hexes to temporarily allow a worker to move heavier stone
- headdress: required to finish building a moai at a build site
- additional worker
- half-tablet; 2 halves can be used to temporarily upgrade a worker

The game ends when ... something happens. In addition to VP earned during the game, you score VP for remaining tablets and coins. Whoever has the most VP wins!

4 player game:
Very fresh design with good ideas and a very well balanced game combining luck and strategy. Full of difficult choices I liked it a lot. This is a preliminary rate. I could change it after a few more plays. I just have the feeling that this game takes a bit too long, maybe 30 minutes longer than it should. One of the best productions I've ever seen in boardgames, not only the quality of the components but also its functionality and artwork. Congratulations Matagot and Miguel Coimbra.

I just love the way players are compelled to play cooperatively and that comes as a second nature in the game, it's not an end on itself.
Sometimes dice don't help because only a few good moaïs become available and those turns can be somehow frustrating but then again it's just the way things are. If you have a good chance of grabbing a good moaï maybe you should get it then just because it could happen that later in the game they wont appear. Points awarded during the game are very important too. I mean, there's always a balanced situation on the board and if I'm rewarding a player with some points in one place maybe he is rewarding me also with points somewhere else. If not, maybe I'm not playing this well and probably won't be able to win.

Superb hybrid of auction, deliver and worker placement. All wrapped up in an engaging theme. Appears semi co operative, however that part is min max.Turn order is brutal and key in that you need to plan your moves when going late The only criticism could be that there is only one path to victory. Helping out others move does give points and you might be able to speed up the ending to stop the 'engine' player. However i do wonder if there is much choice other than to build an engine. Lovely to look at too!

Blog entry
Until recently i was selling this game at £14.99 and i now regret not keeping a copy. It's very good. The first thing you notice about the game is the lavish production, it has an attractive board (depicting Easter island) and imposing looking Moais that you are erecting for VPs. One grumble is that the scuplts of the workers, Priests and Cheifs are different (usually a good thing) but here it just added a bit of cinfuion to the board, you can tell them apart by colour and base shape but I would have preferred them a little more uniform.

The game itself is a hybrid worker placement/Pick up and deliver game with a twist of auction. Each round you auction Moais (which must be sculpted by your workers thus using them), you then place workers, your chief or your sorcere on the board. The workers are placed to help move your (and other players) moais to the VP squares surrounding the Island, the sorceror can be used to get you more workers, auction tokens, logs or a headdress for the Moais (extra VPs if delivered). The Chief can act as a strong worker or as a Sorceror under certain conditions. Both the cheief and the Sorceror can be used to reserve a juicy VP square for your Moai.

After your tribe has been place don the board you take it in turn to move the Moais and headdresses. This is one of the most intereting partsof the game, as it requires more than one worker to shift the larger (more VPs) Moais and to do so you may have to use hexs on network created by another player. Because there is no restiction on the number of workers, or from which player, that may occopy a hex, then coopartion is very likely. And you get rewarded for doing so, if i were to use another players worker to help move a Moai then they will score VPs.

The Moais starton one side of the island and can ne movced to VP squares sourrounding the island. The biggest payoffs come at the far side of the island and the larger the Moai (they come in three sizes) the bigger the VP multiple. Headress for the Moais (neet little scuplts - some of which look like Tommy Cooper's fez) start at the oppositbe end of the Island to the Moais and the points scored for headresses are highest on the opposite side (nearest the where the Moais start) 

There is a delicious tension in the game; do i go the large paying Moais which will take a few turns to get there or try and score quick points and possibly end the game (it fisnhs after a certain number of Moais are built, depending on the number of players)quickly? There is alos a tension between building up your tribe to help socre the big moais or gettng them on the board quickly.

The only critcism of the game is that there are not many paths to victory. Its about scoring Moais and helping others move them, and whilst this might be intersting for a few games it might not have much long term replayability. Which is probably why it ended up in the bargain bin, as an RRP of £45 for a game that you will only play 3 or 4 times is a bit steep. Nevertheless, if you can find a cheap copy i'd snap it up. I only wish i had when the were sitting on the shelf at £15.

Far more of a game than appears from the reading of the rules. As Zirk would say, this game has shape. Beginning with simple builds around the Moai quarry, builds further west, hats heading east and the final mad scramble. Never a dull moment.

I would strongly recommend playing with one or two fewer bases as the game does take a long time to complete. Use 5 or possibly 6 bases instead of 7 in the 3 player game. I doubt you would lose much except maybe 45 minutes off the game time :)

Pleasantly surprised. An interesting bidding mechanic, constraints on how many Moai you can have on the go at a time, and the possibilities for temporary alliances to move Moais to their destinations all make for an enjoyable game. Very attractive components. I've even grown to like the way some Moais wobble a bit: it keeps you on your toes.

Good cuality material vs price ratio, as usual in any matagoat production. Rules should be more clear for a "plug and play" game. The game mechanics are not that hard for that rulebook.

Well produced pick up and deliver game set on Easter Island. Players have to transport sculptures to certain parts of the island where they will gain points at the end of the game for doing so. Each player has a group of men used for the transportation of the sculptures by placing them in chains across the board, a chief who represents three men, and a sorcerer who can be used in a variety of ways such as obtaining more men, producing wood that can be supplemented with men to help transport sculptures, and producing additional parts for the sculptures to produce more points. At the start of each turn players bid on the available sculptures with larger ones bestowing more points if they reach their destinations but requiring more people to transport them. There are a few different mechanisms to be found in this game and the component quality is excellent but overall there's nothing really that stands out in the gameplay making it a particularly memorable experience.

The pieces are a bad quality: the Moai statues cannot stand stabilly and the hats do not fit.

Interesting mechanisms though. Basicaly pick up and deliver but with some unusual bidding and transportation rules.

I don't like it very much after the first game. I think the quality of the pieces disturbs me mostly.

If just there was not such a rule as "mmmm I can move my statue and give player to points to either player A or player B, and it will make no difference to me. Who do I choose? I'll choose B since he brought snacks to the game night" (of course there is not such a rule, and players should try to balance who they're giving free points too... but what I mean is that I dislike rules that allow kingmaking). Great board and materials, and a couple of nice ideas, though.

Awesome game. I don't like co-op games, but this sort of (not mandatory) co-operation in a competitive game is great and makes decisions even deeper. 

Great components. We play with open scoring, because if information is trackable, it should be visible and not a silly memory game aspect. We also put our bases in front of our screens for the same reason.

Played twice so far with 4 players. It's a little tough to grok initially, but a good strategy is starting to formulate. It is a very nice game with seemingly a lot of strategy. The components are top-notch for the most part and the rules are mostly clear. The end game can sneak up on you if you are not careful. One recommendation: don't play this game while drinking lots of alcohol. I ended up delivering a headdress to another player's moai. Oops!

Giants is a pickup-and-deliver with a few novel twists (including an auction) but from the moment that you see the board, you can see the statue-moving drudgery:  this end to that end, that end to this end.  Are we done yet?  The production quality is uneven.

Excellent components. The game rules need some clarifications that you can find in the Rule section on BGG. The game is rather interesting although it is not obvious what to do in each turn. It is more an opportunistic game that you have to rely your strategy on what other people will do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A 7 rating is slightly generous/optimistic. I was surprised and intrigued at first game's end as the player who actually built up their "engine" (got all their workers) actually placed last.

The general idea of Giants is to transport Moais to the coast. The Moais start out at one end of the island and the further away you transport them the more points you get. Naturally the spots to build them are limited.

You mainly use your workers (and wood, which is limited; the forests get chopped completely down very quickly) to transport the Moais, and you can use other players' workers as well. They get some points for this. This tends to create short-term paths of least resistance for Maois, like ants transporting large bits of food.

You can use your sorcerer piece to chop down trees, get another worker, or get another bidding token. These tokens are spent (only temporarily) to bid on Moai selection order, to get Rongo tablets that let you use another one of your pieces as a sorcerer, and to put on your Moais as hats so no one can steal one that you built but haven't finished moving.

You can also use your sorceror to build headdresses that can then be transported to finished Moais, but I didn't see anybody ever choosing to do that. I consider this a design flaw, though not a fatal one, as you can just ignore the mechanism. The problems are that the sorcerer is too dear to use to make headdresses, and transportation from the headdress factory will be too slow until multiple players want to focus on that. But the game constantly gives you Moais to score off of for free, and by the time people have built out to the headdress area, the game is nearly over. I think you would only make headdresses when you have nothing else to do.

I view the auction as a flaw as well. It's supposed to be a blind bid using a very tight currency (tokens). The only thing at stake is Moai selection order, and it doesn't seem like enough to be worth having an auction.

Components are cute but iffy. Some of the Moais are wobbly (don't knock the table), the headdresses and marking tokens are supposed to fit on the Moais like hats but they mostly won't go on at all, and the tiny log pieces aren't a good idea. They're evocative... But only of a [i]single[/i] log.

I wonder to what extent the game plays itself if you know what you're doing. It seemed obvious that the sorcerers should initially be used to chop down all the wood you can, and after that mostly focus on building up your worker count. And with movement it doesn't seem to make sense to strike out on your own if you can help it... As soon as one player opens a path in a direction, most likely the other players should also continue to forge that path.

This game seems to have been really overlooked. It's gorgeous and offers an unique take on competitive cooperation. The movement of statues is sort of a hidden hand mechanism. There's some attempt to create a trail together. More so, though, each person adds support to pursue their own advantage, and the trails develop because of and sometimes despite this pursuit of self-interest. The thematic representation of the destruction of Easter Island is also something not to be missed. A game that features both the hidden hand of the market and the tragedy of the commons... the Janus-faced nature of unrestricted competition.

In this game, players incarnate clan leaders during the Golden Age of Easter Island. The board represents a simplified map of the island. Rock platforms (ahus) are where the Moaïs (monumental sculptures) will be erected.

Your clan competes against others, and you will earn more prestige by building and transporting larger, more imposing Moaïs than your opponents' clans.

Each of your pawns represents a group of men. You can grow your population if you wish. You will choose each turn which part of your population will sculpt Moaïs and which other part will transport them, in cooperation with other players.

Statues are transported from the quarry to the ahus (the rock platforms) using paths made of pawns and the help of logs.

You can use your influence (Tribal Markers) to choose the best statues and mark to your color the statues you cannot achieve in your turn. You can also rely on your Sorcerer and his mighty powers, of the strength of your Chief, as well as on mystic powers of the Rongo writing tablets.

The winner will be the one who has erected the largest statues in the best places at the end of the game.

Entertaining resource management/pick up & deliver game that starts a little slow, but can end sooner than expected. The pace really picks up after the first two or three turns. Not sure if I would have liked the game as much as I do if the theme was not as well integrated as it is now, or if the components were less appealing. Even though some of the statues are a bit wobbly and some of the hats to do not fit them, the game looks really inviting and offers some real "turn angst".

The theme and mechanics save this one for me (right down to the inevitable deforestation near game end). Ahead of it's time, from 2008. Hats off to Matagot.
I don't feel an immediate urge to paint the minis. It feels, IMHO, rather than co-operating with the other players, that you're taking advantage of them, but I don't mind... and what Bill said.
Built the [gameid=40681] mini  expansion, as well as my own 'Birdman' expansion... thank me, [i]Rick[/i] - great job on both of [i]those[/i].. she-it.
Microbadges for this really stink... the Moai looks like a monkey. The other two, well, your guess is as good as any.

I didn't really enjoy Giants.  It is a very involved game, perhaps overly so, that takes a very long time to play.  For instance, each turn players take turns laying down little figures.  In a 4 player game you might have 5 figures per player meaning 20 pieces need to be placed.  When I played, each player took a minute or more placing each little figure.  It might be required for strong strategy but it felt like torture.  I might enjoy the game if players used a 10second timer or something for taking turns.

RATING: 4
Stunning and thematic, lots of interaction, unfortunately  too complex for non-gamers and a bit too chaotic for euro-gamers

[+] components are amazing, the board is huge, each color set of pawn is different, the moaïs are great; the blind double bidding for moaïs is interesting
[-] Giant box! wood log pieces (why so small?); there are not many rounds, but it can drag; the scoring mechanism when moving pieces using other players worker is painful to keep track of; there's not enough time to develop a strategy alone, you must take advantage of the other players' pawns to move and score further, so in the end the game is more tactical than strategic

RATING: 5
In addition to the official rules changes announced here on BGG, our group plays with the following house rules: firstly, all players start with 3 workers and 3 influence tokens; secondly, the person who goes first in choosing moais also goes first in the placement phase. With these little rules mods the game seems to work pretty well. It appears that emergent alliances are the key to success, but to what extent they can be predicted and/or incentivized is unclear at this point. Ostensibly, there seem to be a couple different strategic approaches to the game, and there are trade offs to having more influence tokens versus workers. This might be a buy- I still need more plays to solidify my opinion. It's a shame that the "right" rules aren't included in the box, as it makes the game difficult to recommend.

Did the designers/developers of this game ever playtest it with the actual components???  A reasonably good game that is ruined by overproduced components that just don't work.  Logs?  They roll all over the board.  Hats?  Ha - they don't stay on.  "Banner?" - You've got to be kidding if you think this works.  Player Aids?  Worse than useless as they cause more confusion than they solve.

This game is fantastic.  I'm totally willing to excuse the fact that not all of the things that are supposed to fit on Moai's heads actually fit well, or at all in some cases.

Turn order and route building force you to make very interesting decisions throughout the game.

I suspect the tablets may need to be worth less in final scoring for balance, but that's an easy solve.

An interesting and beautifully presented game. We won't play it often due to the 3-5 player count (often the kiss of death in our collection) but we picked up a copy for £20 which seemed like a bargain given the production quality.

We've not actually played our copy of this. 3-5 players is a tough niche in our house. Would consider a trade.

< November 2016

It's that 3-5 player count again that saw to the end of this. We picked up a cheap copy it sat on the shelf for a few months and we sold it on without playing it. Kev still has it so we might play his.

Great game with gorgeous, if annoying, components.  (Don't bump the table!)  I can best describe this as an ephemeral rail game.  As far as the things for which Rapa Nui / Easter Island are famed, this features the Moai and the deforestation.  Disease, political unrest, and warring are omitted.  The result:  A very solid game with a fascinating memory component (which you could discard if the players dislike it), which seems at first like it will be no problem, until you're well into the game.  My second game, I carefully memorized the sites where I'd constructed Moai.

Nekem negatívum volt a komponensek minősége, hiszen az alapvetően szép játékot olyan apróságok eléggé elrontják, miszerint a jelölő "sapka" nem megy fel a szoborra. De nem egy, hanem az összes. :(

Gorgeous components and a really solid game. The memory elements are hilarious as you could end up giving an opponent a stack of points, and the way you can utilise anyones pieces make for some really strategic placement.

Astonishing simulation, but it really isn't what I'm looking for in a solo game.  I want to be challenged with decisions, not feel like I'm watching a movie (where I have to do a lot of work with tables).

Must try on Vassal - if that does lots of the work for you.

A great game!  This game simulates the horrors the bomber crews face 20,000 feet above "Fortress Europe" on a daily basis.  Though a very deadly game it is a great challenge where a very few complete a 25 mission tour with their original crew men much less their plane.

Best when played as a cooperative squadron in an online campaign or at a convention in a mass squadron effort.

RATING: 6
Very thorough design with lots of detail and theme.  Can get a bit repetative, though, as it's all about dice rolling and consulting various charts.  Like Star Fleet Battles, a computer version streamlines play quite a bit, but that also takes away some of the fun.  If you're playing for the story it generates, this is great.

Interesting solo experience.  Rough in pure oldschool fashion, my bomber went down many times when I played this game.  But, you still have to go up again.  Flight after flight.  Reminds me of a certain novel...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'll give this one a point for nostalgia's sake, but it gets old quickly.  Your only decision is where to aim your guns if you can aim a turret at multiple targets.  Otherwise, you roll the dice and consult the charts.  It does tell a wonderful narrative, but so does a book.  If you are going to play, get on the play-by-forum because that is the way to play this game.

RATING: 4.5
Not a bad solitaire game about making a bombing run in your B-17 and getting back home in one piece. A bit heavy on the luck though as at each point along the way you are just rolling dice and looking up the result on a table then carrying out the result. There are lots of better solitaire games out there so why bother with this.

I could never get into this game. Not sure what the problem is. Like Ambush, there is tons of narrative here, heck, it's ALL narrative! Maybe that's the problem, unlike Ambush, there is almost nothing you can do to change what is happening in the game. All you do is roll the dice and record what happened to you plane. You are too much of a bystander. Not that that isn't realistic, it fits the theme perfectly. But it's just not that interesting to be a bystander.

Very good solitaire game.  You get the sense of how rough it was to be in the B-17 flying in the 8th AF.  A modified group version was run yearly in Pacificon(now Conquest).  Load of fun as you sweat out the bomb run with at least 36 other players.  Punched copy at my parent's place.

An absorbing solo game, purely for the involvement it gives you - there's almost no room for skill but you start to root for your crew and their ship to make it through.

RATING: 8
My favorite wargame for solo play (actually, I've never played it non-solo). Unlike most wargames, B-17 has a highly detailed set of damage/injury outcomes which affect the gameplay. When your B-17 is strafed by a Luftwaffe fighter, it could kill your pilot, knock out your radio, take down your oxygen system, etc. and you're forced to take actions as a result of the damage. The most satisfying missions are when you manage to crawl back to base on one engine, crash land, and still have your crew injured and beaten, but intact. Naming bombers and crews make for an interesting approach to campaigning (although having a plane or even a crew member retire after completing 25 missions requires a lot of luck).

Bastantes partidas no registradas.

Para la época resultó un juego muy narrativo y hasta entretenido en ocasiones pero con un gran problema... la presencia humana es prescindible :-).

Ninguna decisión relevante a tomar y mecánicas muy repetitivas. Juegas partidas una tras otra y ves el devenir de tu avión y su tripulación pero no puedes hacer nada útil para cambiar su destino más allá de tirar el dado :-(.

Realmente esto ha condicionado mi opinión sobre él durante todos estos años pq aunque la idea es buena, no puedo considerarlo un juego ya que no supone reto intelectual ninguno. Digamos que es mucho más parecido a leer un libro.

Finalmente, aunque le tengo cierto cariño, he decidido desprenderme de él pq lo veo tremendamente superado por solitarios actuales de temática parecida con mucha enjundia y decisiones interesantes. Era obvio que este momento iba a llegar tarde o temprano.

Played a lot when a shortage of opponents. Haven't had a plane survive 25 missions yet, the Luftwaffe are just too darn vicious...or maybe my luck is shot?

Revised my rating from 5 to 6.75 when I dragged this out again and found my logsheet. My first plane the 'Kerry B' survived 16 missions, before exploding in a fireball over the English Channel on mission 17. It was all down hill from there, with 'Big Bertha' downing in the Channel on its  2nd misson and most of the crew drowning..my last plane 'Advanced Panic Technique' flew one mission to Hamburg and shot down 4 enemy fighters before making it home  with the Co pilot KIA..I haven't had the heart to take it back over the Flak zone since.

Your definitely strapped into the passenger's seat and just along for the ride, but it's an exillerating ride.  I'm not usually much of a solo person, but I'm enjoying this one.

Good solitair gaming experience. Becomes repetitive after a few playings. But nice to play one mission in around 30 minutes. So it is a proper adventure game after all.

It is a simulation based on probability charts, hence it is a life like experience ... without the danger of actually risking your ass by sitting in these shooting galleries.

People seeking after Euro game mechanics with heavy decision making will not like it much, but this wargame is a good simulation of what actually was happening in these raids. You really couldn't do much but hope for the better.

It is still a good experience though for those seeking a solitaire thematic game and story telling, even after 30 years. Something you really can't say about most computer games of that kind of age.

Solo fun! B-17 suffers from a common problem in many solo games, which is zero decision making. But so what? It is fun! I am 16 missions in (as of 8/12/12) and my crew is still mostly intact, as is my bomber (The Miss Behavin'). Play with the alternate Tail Gunner rules as this will make the longer missions especially more manageable. Edit: Completed 25 missions with the Miss Behavin'. Our Top Turret gunner Master Seargant Justin Roth ended up shooting down 43 planes.

Got this one because my grandfather was a navigator on a B-17 during WWII and he had told me interesting stories about his missions.  This is a fairly easy game to play and is fun to set up and play.  My brother and I each took turns playing it.  I enjoyed naming the planes, etc.  What's funny is that most planes back then were named after women and here we were giving our planes "evil" names like Black Lightning and Demon's Wings.

Very fun solo game that gives you a terrorizing ride full of suspense with each throw of the die as you cringe and hope one of your crew members or critical engine components is not hit when enemy Fighters come tearing by your B-17.  The main criticism of the game is that it is very random and chart heavy - which both are true.  

I enjoy it more as an experience game as oposed to a deep strategy game.  It's also very fun to jump into the BGG play by forum squadron play where you fly missions with others and share results across the squadron.

Not much of a game as there are hardly any decisions to make but interesting to see how your crew fares. I lost my B-17 over the channel whilst returning from my seventh trip. I came close to hitting the target only once. The rear gunner shot down one Me110 on the fifth mission only to be killed himself on the next raid. Tragic!
Might be fun to play as part of a 'squadron' at a convention if organised well.

Easy solitaire game to whip out when you need a fix, but lack suitable opposition--not that this is all THAT suitable; the system leaves something to be desired as a challenge, at least in early missons, but the flavour is distinctive.

More of a stochastic story-generating algorithm than a game. Computers do this stuff better than they did in 1981; the only real appeal is nostalgia or games-must-be-on-cardboard commodity fetishism, neither of which are strong with this guy. Traded.

This solo game is a dice fest and the options open to the player are limited.  It does ,however, have a hypnotic charm and can leave a player wanting to try one more time.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

I love the subject matter, so playing this game was only natural. It is great when played with others on one of the online "virtual" bomber squadrons.

Fun solitaire game that's really an RPG lite. The main goal is bringing your bomber/crew back home after 25 missions, which are simulated through a series of die rolls (a dice fest, actually). Not much decision making in the game, but you get quite attached to your guys and when your plane goes down (as down it will ... trust me) you'll have a real twinge! I've never managed to complete all 25 missions (if my character dies - the pilot, natch - I start over), and the most memorable campaign of this game I played lasted until the 25th mission - which was Schweinfurt! Needless to say, the guys didn't come back ...

I've had some memorable games flying the Bootiful Becky with a crew of 'friends' who always seem to meet a sticky end (only to be resurrected for the next mission). The mechanisms may be a little dated but the narrative effect of the game is first-class.

Solitaire command of a single B-17 over Europe. Best 'role-playing' wargame I have ever played.  Name each crew member  and feel it when they are injured or are killed. Good balance on detail and playability.  Did get a little repetitive after the first 25+ missions though.

Playing this solo game recreates the WW2 bombing raids very well. The experience trying to get the plane up in the air and the crew savely back to England is good.

After a couple of mission it becomes clear the game is basically about rolling dice and consulting the many, many tables. Choices to be made are minimal.

A really simple yet tense game. Once you get into the groove of the mission steps and which tables to look up, sorties will fly by quickly. I recently started playing it again after an absence of more than 20 years and felt like I have never left. And it is even easier if you use VASSAL - perfect for business trips and those long wait at the airports.

Great game! How I hate to lose my men to German fighters...struggled back to base, holes everywhere, burns, wounded, KIA's...decision making in game who cares when all u want to do is get your men & plane home safely...usually never in one piece...and it's just a brilliant game IMHO because the feelings that the game creates. A genuine empathy for our personally named cardboard crew...doesn't sound right but it really works! I named one of my gunners after a person at work who I never really liked...Ahem...and I put him in the tail gunner position...after several enemy fighter attacks he actually saved our bacon...and several missions I even liked the guy! (Too bad the real life version never saved anything but himself-he was eventually lost bailing out over Germany as a POW) 

I put my mates in crew positions, relatives, sometimes famous movie stars-Clint Eastwood has piloted many a mission. Play it. Don't believe all you read. Find out fer yerself! Be it. If u don't like after playing fine. At least ya gave it a whirl and u know. Read a book by Ambrose...or some vet first hands experiences.

Reasonably enjoyable solitaire game. There aren't a lot of decisions, though. Really, you just assign MG fire and everything else is automated. Fairly straightforward game play, though there's some errata.

Less a solitare wargame and more an RPG. It's good fun [though I don't quite see how/why it commands such high $ in the resale market]. The likelihood of surviving a 25-mission "career" is slim without a some cheati...err..."mulligans." However, the various variants add some longevity and, if you fly the "Porcupine," survivability. It's a good solo game and, if you can get a group of folks together to create a bomber-wing [as well as to have someone "pilot" the FWs and MEs looking to drop you from the skies], you're looking at a GREAT game.

A rather dull and boring solo dice game where you flew a B17 on missions over Europe.  Alas, you didn't make any decisions at all.  You roll dice, look up results, and keep on going.  The thrill was in the "ride".   London's Burning was a much better solo air game.

This is one of AH’s solo board game hits. The two maps are small and very simple. On one map you get the B-17 looking it from above and one the other you have the operations map divided by concentric circles; having at the center your airbase. You have a lot of paperwork to fill in: name of plane, crew, mission data and status. Upon taking off, the game will try to do anything possible to avert you from your goal: from aborting your mission, cause fire on your plane to shoot you down and capture your crew. The game achieves this by sending wave after wave of enemy fighter planes popping up all around you. Your crew has to deal with them before serious damage occurs. The B-17 can take a lot of punishment and still complete its mission and return to its base, though not in one piece! Although rules are plenty they are clear and game play is cool. After one test mission you get the concept of game play and you are ready to roll. “The General” issues provide more scenarios and optional rules to add flavor to the theme.

Fun game to play, although it is pretty much a marathon of chart-checking and die-rolling.  Everything in the game is driven by a pile of charts and the die rolls you get on each of them.

It seems strange now, but years back I spent whole weeks playing it, even re-creating bombing raids in a plane-by-plane basis. Even choosing names for your planes and crew were part of the fun. The system was far from perfect (the dreaded fuel tank hit!) but it was terribly addictive; you just begged for a good die-roll to save your wounded gunner bailing-out over the Channel...
The General published supplements for 15th Air Force, and even turning it into a R.A.F. Lancaster.
In our PC days it can be not much successful, but it certainly was (at least for me) in its own time.

RATING: 8
Realistic simulation, tense, and fun to play.  Good rulebook and graphics.  If want to experience the emotional ups and downs of being in command of a B-17 on bombing missions over Europe, this "oldie but goodie" classic is for you! 

Good luck on making 25 missions if you play the campaign scenario.  The odds, as during the real war at the time depicted in the game, are against you.  My B-17 went down in flames after taking a flak hit on the third try for Mission 16 after two previous aborts.  Don't believe the saying "The third time is a charm" unless you're German!

An enjoyable if somewhat scripted solo game, that can become tense if you develop any attachment to your crews. Can be difficult to win, which I suppose is pretty much a given with solo games. I recommend this game to aerial warfare enthusiasts, as it seems in line with what WW2 veterans report about their missions. This could be fun with your buddy playing the enemy, and making the associated rolls. 

There are no real decisions to be made while playing this, and it could rightly be called a bit of a dice fest. It's got some strong randomness. 

If you don't like solo games, don't bother with this one. If you like solo games and don't mind a few dice, then by all means pick up a battered copy and have a go. I wouldn't recommend breaking the bank to buy B-17 however.

How can one get excited about a solitaire game in which your one way destination is a city which you will hopefully bomb to oblivion all the while trying to elude or survive the finest Luftwaffe fighters?  Plenty is what I say.  Yes everything is dice driven, yes tension relies on the amount of enthusiasm you put into it, and yes you do get blown out of the sky every now and then.  But it is much better than doing housework.  Essen, here I come!

Two plays have been nailbiters.  One was over before it started.  The biggest complaint against this game is that it is a bit of a dicefest. That is largely true, but not entirely. The player does determine where guns will shoot for defensive fire. Decisions get even more critical when crewmembers start dying, and you have to man different systems with limited personnel. Some will still say there aren't significant decisions. However, I will say that, if you can get into the story, it is great fun, even if there's a little bit of "roll-an-adventure" to it.

It seems pretty realistic. After all, the crew was largely along for the ride.

This a fantastic solitaire game and is an amazing B-17 simulation. It may not have tons of choices to make, but it sure is fun! I want to play it often and look forward to making it to 25 missions and playing in the forums!

Acquired Mar 08 - First sitting 3 plays.  Looking forward to getting into the longer more dangerous missions!

Great fun and can get very tense.  Decision making is minimal, but my kids love flying "with me". 

Up to 43 missions.  I've lost quite a number of planes and I still have never had an ACE.  (very close though once).  Still fun and even better playing in a squadron with friends.  Decision making is subtle (especially when to use the rabbit's foot, if you get one).  But still mostly random.

Extremely difficult game for me to rate. I have never played solo and would probably be a bit bored with it. I tend to have a few (2-4) friends flying in my squadron and we roll the German attacks against one another. This is usually a good time had by all.

RATING: 7.5
A great narrative game. I have played this one to death but I still find myself going back to this every little while. Granted you have very limited decisions but you hardly notice this fact while you are in the middle of the game trying to fend off German fighters. It takes the luck of the Irish and more to get through 25 missions with the same bomber.

Extremely fun game to play despite the "game controlled" enemy.
I played this one to death.  several missions in one night, in fact.
I never had a plane or crew member make it to 25 missions, so that kinda makes it a tad unrealistic.
I wish I still had it, but unfortunately this game, and several others, wound up in a box that was mistakenly taken to the garbage.

Played a few times, then gave it away.  Shows the limfacs of "paper simulators".  Not much to do here, as target selection , routing, and engagements are all determined randomly.  While that IS accurate with regard to crews:  they had no control over these factors, it makes for very repetitive games.  Very little/no player decision making-which is not good as one of the points of wargaming IS the decision making the player(s) make.

Avalon Hill's classic solo aircraft game. Resource management of crew as you fly mission after mission trying to survive the magic 25! Great system and can be dramatically tense trying to get those guys back 'home'. Lost a little bit of its edge since the advent of computer versions which make it less bookish and increase the visual drama! It helps playing in PBEM campaigns which can really add to the experience!

Playing a full squadron campaign mission where I fly twelve B17's simultaneously. Makes for a very interesting experience indeed...loads of die rolling and book keeping though! Good fun!

Have now completed two missions flying with twelve planes and have now decided to fly with three squadrons of 6 planes each...so a full 18 planes to worry about for mission three of my campaign game!

Mission 4 flying an 18 plane Squadron. Target is Rennes Railway Marshaling Yards. Started last year and stalled through in-action by me. Will resume very soon to try and finish it off. Currently two B17's downed and a third out of formation due to oxygen out. Have yet to get over target...so there is a little way to go yet! Stalled again hope to revisit soon 01/06/2015.

B-17 was a early hit in solitaire gaming, that has clearly remained popular enough to imitate and still inspire.

In a way, the game is something of a move and roll: players take their bombers on a hazardous WWII mission, trying to shepherd them from base to target, score hits on the target and then survive their return home.

I have played and enjoyed The Hunters, which is an obvious spin-off, and watch the popular Spin-off of Silent Victory gain traction quickly- so it is obvious there is room for this sort of wargame, with minimal decision making, and random result sets.

What is the attraction? Like an RPG, the game invites you to inhabit the space and lives of real airmen (or Seamen in the Hunters) and share the perils that they lived with during WWII. It brings little new light to Catch 22 when you see the airmen wounded, the planes struggling to survive against enemy fighters from every angle, the bombing runs where pilots try to hold things together. Also, having a board, and choosing the angles of defense, and how much ammo to pour out at the enemy keeps players very much in the game.

What are the drawbacks? The set of tables needed to apply damage is a little less organized in this A-H effort, making more colors and sheets to keep organized. A couple more dice rolls needed to allot the damage. The fact that there is very little decision making can do in the end to aid survival.

To make it through 25 missions is clearly difficult. My first milkrun across the channel left me with leaks in both wing tanks, intercom out, one aileron damaged beyond repair, and the heater out in the Nose compartment, after being ganged up by two different packs of fighters, in Zone 2. The pilot scrubbed the mission, and came home with a load of eggs- but he brought the bird back.

The story is the appeal. I am starting this at a 6.75, with some likely as the system grows fresher for me. I find these games surprisingly involving- which I guess should be no surprise considering the value used copies carry.

A-H gave us a good one here, and I am sure I will continue to enjoy it.

Nice solitaire simulation of bomber missions over Germany (if a bit too deadly). I still remember my crew of Soviet airmen shot down over La Manche in their B-17, named CRUSH THE NEST OF THE FASCIST VIPERS. You can tell the game made a big impression since I still remember this decades later.

Still new to the game but have had some very fun missions. Not sure if it was intended as a role playing game or not, but sure is easy to get wrapped up in the crew's well-being and the plane's survival as the missions pile up. Find myself pulling this out whenever I have some time to myself.

I'm not sure why but I like this game. I don't usually like "strategy games" with this much luck. I consider it an rpg lite almost. As the B-17 crew you have very little control except deciding which target to shoot at and which positions in the B-17 will be left empty after your gun men are shot, but it's fun anyway.

This game is an interesting simulator of the terror that the crews of the big birds must have gone through.  In B17:QotS you are at the mercy of the dice, much like the crews of a Heavy bomber was at the mercy of German fighters or German Flak.  They never know when Their number was up, and nither will you in this game.

B17:QotS playes much better with a group, like at the Cons or on the web in one of the many PBeM campaigns.

RATING: N/A
players who enjoy games that take them along for a ride, such as B-17: Queen of the Skies* are apt to enjoy this game(raf). Those who need to make a lot of decisions in their gameplay should go into this game(raf) knowing that it may lack something they may deem critical to enjoyable gameplay.

There's more decision making in RAF than in B-17 by far. But I do think that many players will regard the decision making present in RAF as not enough.

RATING: 4
Played it twice...but the flaws and table look ups with dice roll solitaire system failed to spark much interest.  My primary beef was the use of a six sided die, poor result table designs, and a lack of good historicity.  On both missions I played, my crew shot down all the attacking fighters...(boring).  At the time I bought this, I confess being more interested in multi-player table top games.  This would have been a fun game to run with a computer program since that would have played much faster.

OK, a disclaimer:  I'm a pilot, and a hobby of mine was WWII combat aircraft, and B-17's are my favorite plane.  Oh, and I frequently have no one to game with, so I enjoy solo games.

In seriousness, I love this simulation - just enough depth to feel like a simulation, without drowning you in charts and numbers.  Highly recommended if you have any interest in the subject matter.

Solitaire wargame where you control a B-17 bomber on missions over Nazi-controlled Europe. It's hard to rate this game, it being so many years since I played it. On the one hand, I can't really see the charm of it these days and wouldn't want to play it again (each mission consists of many, many, dierolls against various tables, and relatively few decisions), but on the other I *did* play out several hundred missions back in the days when I really digged the game. :)

GREAT! solitare game.  I love WWII and I love B-17's so my opinion might be biased.  For a historical simulation the game is not dry or boring because you get attached to your crew and your plane.

A great solo experience if you really buy into the theme and play as a campaign rather than one off games.

Solitaire--This solo game is great fun in a tournament setting with players in squadrons, and an "opponent" rolling your dice (I would rate squadron play as a 9).  Even alone, it's addictive (would rate as 8).  There are a lot of charts with many rule exceptions/additions, though.

RATING: 4
Another forgettable solo gaming experience for me.  This game is 0% strategy and 100% luck.  Bombers go up, planes attack randomly, roll dice to see if they hit, roll dice to see where they hit, roll dice to see damage.  Repeat.

I enjoyed playing campaigns this when I first got this. It was always fun trying to keep stats and records for the best characters you have had. I doubt I will find the time to get back into playing this. I wouldn't mind trying this again if there were a computer version of this, since that should let you play through the missions very quickly.

you have very little to do in game, almost no decisions of your own. So game is playing mostly itself and you are here to move pieces around and throw buckets of dice.

Love it, i played it over and over and cant have enough of it. My 9 year old son roll the dice for the German aircraft, my 1st bomber (aka Spearmen/4 mission exp.) got hit in the bombs bay and the bombs explode killing everybody on board. My 2nd bomber (aka Gladiator/7 mision exp.) got hit on the port wing by a hell diving FW 190 and the fuel tank got fire, even with my rabbitfoot the hit was the same, everybody bail out over Belgium but they end up as P.O.W.
My son's smile was everlasting.
I love this game absolutely. Bought it on E-bay from England. Best solo game ever, Its a good thing to watch Memphis Belle also.

Classic solo game of flying bombing missions during WWII.  The game technically can play 2 players, but nobody recommends that version.  It is truly a game of luck, but is such fun and has great theme and tells a story.  Love this one... and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually like solo board games.

I have not previously logged solitaire plays.  But since this is a intended as a solitaire game, I will log my plays.

1st Mission - A fair bit of floundering around with the rules.  But I eventually figured it out.  On the plus side, one of my crew shot down an FW-190.  On the down side we missed our bombing target.  Ready for mission #2...

Love imagining the narrative. After one campaign you really need to add the variants and options available on Board Game Geek (many from the General magazine) to continue getting immersed in the missions, as the original game focuses on a very intense, and deadly period of the war. Without the variants I'd rate this a 5, but with the added options it is a 9.

A nice n' quick solo game or rather a simulation of sorts. The player doesn't make many decisions other than where to target the gun and otherwise managing the crew.

For a solitare game, B-17 is an awful lot if fun even if a major dice fest. Surprisingly tense and the gameplay captures the claustraphobic feeling of being a sitting duck for waves of enemy planes. I have yet to retire a plane and/or crew for completing 25 missions. Also have played this at the local conventions where it has been modified so many people can fly together as a squadron and the planes all protect each other in formation. VERY COOL!

However, Reichstag: Fall of Berlin and other solo games were more interesting.

I enjoyed my first game.  Pay upon Delivery performed well under the limited stress we encountered from 110s and 109s.  We popped two aircraft... one of each actually and had a poor showing for our bombing run (30%) but it could have been worse.  We made it home safely and we'll be flying again soon.  
  
Game 8 of B-17: Queen of the Skies... the Pay on Delivery dies a fiery death when a flak shot penetrates the bomb bay and explodes the payload.  No survivors.  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I really loved playing this game when first got it. After a while it became predictible.  Though it does give a good feel for what it was like to be in a B-17, I think it has a tendency to be too weighted toward crew casualties.  Sure, there were plenty of WIA and KIA in real life but Hans and Fritz didn't shoot THAT good!

RATING: 5.5
Plays 8.  That's ridiculous.  That's the recorded plays.  My wife and I played this game through 2 entire campaigns together.  Our bomber was the Aces High.  We had nose art and everything.  She retired with her original navigator, engineer, radioman and tailgunner, all of whom were DOUBLE ACE gunners after everything was said and done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Old-time solitaire game with lots of charts.  Even though there are very decisions few made throughout the missions, I feel drawn to the storyline and the general suspense.  Wondering how you might possibly survive after being raked twice by Me109's while still inbound to the target, facing heavy flak upon arrival... THAT is what made the game enjoyable!

As mentioned in many other posts, this is not the most historical simulation.  The rate at which you can knock German fighters out of the sky is absolutely ludicrous.  By now, someone out there must have created some sort of corrections to force this back into balance.

Lastly, keep your eyes open for people running squadron campaigns over the internet.  Is is a fun experience and generally do not take an inordinate amount of time.  Besides, you can get awfully creative doing your mission write ups.

In its day, a fun diversion, but ultimately was an exercise in luck - much like the real thing - as the player is reduced to rolling dice and consulting tables. Fun as a research tool, but not much game included in the box, as there is little for the player to do at the end of the day. Gets slightly more mileage when done in group play and experiences are shared.

This is a game that I liked to play when I went to the World Boardgaming Convention.  David Terry ran this tournament.  Unlike the other tournaments at the convention that were very competitive this tournament was more a social event.

Rich Moyer and I attended this convention together and we always had a good time.  Rich won the first place plaque.

I love the theme of the game and this alone has me going back to it on ocassions (that and having nobody to play anything else with). However it is an excercise in die rolling with a bare minimum of decision making to do. It can get very tense trying to return home with a damaged B-17 having hit a target deep in enemy territory, but whether you and your crew make it back or not is completely up to the die. Makes a better experience to have multiple players each having their own B-17 in a formation.

Solitaire game without any real meaningful choices where the player is pretty much one big flying target.  Admittedly, this is historically accurate, but not a game that I enjoy at all.

Bought this game in '86, but never played it until just now (Dec 2014).  A nice diversion game, but there really aren't enough player decisions to make it a great solitaire game in my book.  Mostly, the player flys to target, and random dice rolls rule his fate.  

There is huge narrative value to this game, however.  It is really a WWII role playing game, and that is where the charm is.  Also, one or two missions can easily be done in one sitting, making it a good "end of the day" game when your brain is fried after coming home from work.  I can see why this game continues to get so many plays and has spawned a few expansions and at least spin-off (B-29).

 Game was a lot of fun, not very complex with high solitaire playability. For an Avalon Hill game has
a balanced CRT. You may knock down a few fighters but
you also might miss your target and actually
not make all your missions. 
  Game is about a single B-17 you get to command. No
Campaigns or Wing/Group Commander type scope.
 Game is based on the dark early days of 8th Air Force, 1942. You'll probably want the many
add-ons + variants available on the Internet to keep this game fresh and moving along.

Great solo game.  A classic war game from the eighties.  Found it for a very reasonable price on Ebay (unpunched but opened for $17 dollars including shipping;  it's true!).  

Kind of a luck-fest; dice throws determine all happenings. But the narrative!  Not many games can immerse you in the story like B-17: Queen of the Skies. 

Now have conflict of keeping it or not due to now also owning "The Hunters".

I really wanted to have a few good solitaire games in my collection so I could play by myself.  I'd heard positive things about B-17: Queen of the Skies so I purchased it new.  This is a tense game and I find I become quite attached to my crew and planes.  From my reading of bomber activity and experiences in WWII this game seems to reflect similar results.  Watch the movie 'Memphis Belle' before you play for added atmosphere.  A great solitaire game.

Can hardly imagine a more mind-numbing and sterile exercise than this game: just rolling dice, crossing boxes off ... I could not bring myself to care one whit about the outcome after the third mindless roll of the dice.  There were no decisions, nothing I could do to impact the outcome.  It felt exactly the same as playing the traditional cardgame of War: a purely mechanical exercise.

RATING: 6.5
I played it a fair amount around 1990. It was a fun solitaire game. Quite rules-heavy, so it took a lot of effort to learn, but it re-created the building suspense that could befall a B-17 as it took flak and air attack while trying to complete bombing runs of various difficulties. I also remember the shock of watching a crew I had gotten to know personally suddenly obliterated in a fireball as the plane exploded. It only suffers from the tedium of looking up results from so many charts and the resultant "bookeeping" of recording all events. Therefore, I'd be interested in seeing a more streamlined version of this game, which is basically a good idea and design.

Bought my copy of B-17 QOTS when it was released by AH.  I was in the USAF at the time, at Ellsworth AFB, SD, and I played this game all the time.  I still play quite often and have enjoyed all the additional materials that other players, and myself, have come up with.  I am currently getting experience with the B-17 in the Pacific Theater (1941-1943), using information and materials obtained from many sources.

RATING: 8
One of my first solo gaming experiences. Absolutely no skill involved whatsoever; it's a tables-based dice rolling game. Having said that, it does replicate how impotent one must have felt sitting in a bomber for 8 hours while the Germans tried to shoot you out of the sky. There was very little a bomber crew could do to affect the outcome of their mission, and this game portrays that brilliantly. Getting a crew member, let alone a plane, through thirty missions is hard and again representative of the historical 5% chance of completing a tour. Yet, despite the lack of control you have over the game, the variations on what can happen to you on a mission, and the incredible sense of relief when you land your bird safely back in Blighty, is testament to the game designers. You become very attached to your plane and its crew members. My advice is to name the plane and the crew thoughtfully. It really makes a difference. Hugely atmospheric and a prized part of my collection.

Have the Target Games 1981 version.  It is an excellent solitaire game. Never seen a 25 mission game completed: without re-roles, that is!  The General magazine by Avalon Hill had a cool variant using the heavily gunned "Porcupine" version of a B-17.

Somewhat long in the tooth now, it still is wonderfully immersive.  The downside: a bit dice-heavy, and there are precious few meaningful decisions to make.  It's more like playing out a story, but if you play the campaign version (instead of just one-off flights) you become very attached to the plane and crew.

An early game of mine. Take your B-17 Flying Fortress on wartime bombing missions. Every event is generated by rolling dice on charts, be it weather, damage, enemy forces, bombing accuracy, etc. Missions can vary greatly in length, from an almost uneventful short sortie to Northern France to an action-packed mission deep into the heart of the Reich, fighting off multiple, almost constant enemy fighter attacks, dealing with crew casualties and nursing back to base a damaged-wracked plane on 2 engines - the tension can be almost unbearable, especially if you've become attached to your present long-surviving plane and you're still miles from home. A plane might meet its end through sheer accumulative damage, a single burst of flak inside a full bomb bay, or a crash-landing at base.

Very atmospheric once I could immerse myself.

I agree with other posters here. There does not seem to be a lot of player skill involved in this game. Just find out where you are assigned to bomb, where in the formation you are flying, take the best shots at enemy fighters, drop your load, then turn around and fly back to England. Interesting? Yes. Requires skill? No.

This is a great solitaire game, but the game can also be played with a friend (or spouse) in two ways. For a learning game, the experienced player controls the B-17F while the new player plays the German fighters and rolls for all the other events like flak and such. After that, both of you should fly separate B-17Fs in the same formation with each playing out the German fighters and flak against the other.

OLD SCHOOL SOLITAIRE B-17 RAIDS 
Provisional rating after first play.  Once past the mechanics and table look-ups I see this becoming a very immersive game.  Elsie was shredded by flak during her first mission and put zero bombs on target but the Ball Gunner killed two fighters.  I also see how you can quickly develop an interest in individual crew members.  If you enjoy WWII aviation history and solitaire gaming this is a must try.

QOTS is an "Experience" game where the game takes you for a ride more than you "play".  If you rank games based on "meaningful decisions" = PASS.  If you use the term "dice-fest" as a pejorative = PASS.  If you enjoy narrative and tension and chucking dice = PLAY!

This  game is so addictive that you can't stop; so, for months in 1984 I kept playing until "Cherry Tart XI" made it through 25.  I had six gunners and one pilot make it through their 25 through all those missions.  I dig it out sometimes and go through all those mission sheets that make the box fat. 

I think the guys who did B-29 may have missed the mark by not accepting a higher level of abstraction. They were more interested in the sim than the game. 

Cant post the plays because they all happened in the months after I bought the game at the game store.

I have four short missions under my belt so far. I really enjoyed those missions and am very excited to play this again. I very much want to complete a full campaign.

Mistakes due to lack of familiarity with the rules were common. I'd like to get enough experience with this game to where I'm not making minor housekeeping errors.

I appreciate all the content available for this game. I've downloaded a lot but I want to play the basic game more before I dive into any additional material. There are many excellent fan made player aids available. If you do begin playing this, make sure to spend some time cruising the forum and file section to track down those aids before your first plays.

While there is not much in the way of decision making to this [i]game[/i], err...[i]simulation[/i], I don't believe that is a valid criticism of this game. It should be obvious to anyone who read the rules and the designer's notes at the end that this game was intended to model the story of B-17 bombing missions as closely as possible. From a guy who knows next to nothing about the topic, I think the designer's intent succeeds. This game should be judged and appreciated as a simulation and for the narrative it creates and less for the lack of decision making it allows the player. 

So far, I'm very impressed and am excited to get some more experience with this game.

I enjoy playing this solo game. The sheer volume of enemy aircraft that the game throws at my B-17 is a bit much, though.

If the Luftwaffe could have put 20+ FW190s on each individual B-17, we'd have never got a single bomber past the English channel.

If anything, it would be more historically accurate to have heavier flak, and fewer fighters. Some day I may rig up the rules to reflect this when I play.

Normally I need to rate this game a 1, as it isn't a game at all. It has nearly no decisions at all. All you do is roll and look up the results in a chart. This is done over and over again, with different charts on hand. Once in 50 rolls, you might be able to choose which two fighters you want to aim for, which you barely hit at all. Basically it's just a narrative experience, that tells a story of a B-17 crew, but it's nowhere near to a gaming experience.

Solitaire game, and kind of like playing solitaire. I used to bring this game along to wargame nights when we were playing large scale miniatures battles. I'd play while my opponents were moving, sometimes I'd get a couple of missions at a shot. Haven't really played it since. There's not really much to it, the missions get repetitive, and the game gets tiresome. As a simulation, it really gives you a taste of what the poor bastards in these planes had to go through.

OK, so I do understand the attention to detail and the challenges presented by a solitaire gaming system. Still, the game basically consists of making roll after roll and looking up things on all kinds of charts. There are very few choices that you get to make. I mean, Ambush! was a sweet solitaire game from this era because not only did it give you some fun flavor text, but you got to decide how you moved your men and how you fought the Germans. Here, you might have a choice as to which guns to fire at which fighters and maybe whether or not to bail out, but that's about it. The only thing I could see as being interesting is having a crew from mission to mission and seeing whether or not you could keep any of the guys alive. Also on the plus side is the realization that I wouldn't have ever wanted to be on a B-17 and thank goodness that there was a brave generation of young men that did.

I like it. This is a fun solo game, but with no real strategy for winning. You just roll the dice, consult the tables, assess plane damage, assess crew casualties, and then repeat until your plane and crew either survive the mission or they don't. So it seems a bit limited to me. Still, the game components are very good quality, the rules are well-written, and I can definitely see how it would be tense and exciting if you get close to surviving 25 missions. I wouldn't know having only survived 3 or 4 missions at best.

Got great mileage out of this game in my teens.  Yes, it's luck driven and not a great deal is left to strategy, but the game was enjoyable to play, and made me feel for my crew and plane, and what they had to endure mission after mission.

Fun solo game in its day, particularly if you have in interest in aviation. Much of the fun came from working through the tables to determine what was happening to your aircraft. In the age of computer games I’m afraid this would come off feeling a bit quaint.

B-17 Queen of the Skies is a clever and innovative simulation machine, but not much of a game.  The fact that the guide to the game refers to it early on as a "game"---yep, with quotations marks---seems to confirm this opinion.
So as an educational simulation, this is a success--I learned about the oxygen supplies, heating, and varied guns on a B-17--but as a game that a person plays, this thing isn't very compelling.
Largely, the player rolls dice, looks up the results on one of more than 50 charts, and writes down or moves chits accordingly.  Almost no decisions are made other than by dice destiny, unless the player for some reason decides not shoot at the bad guys or to abort the mission.
I do admire the use of the three boards (map of the region, an internal map of the plane, and an external view of the immediate surroundings of the plane), and I did feel some tension when I finally dropped the payload in my missions, but with some more control over things, some room to actually "play", this innovative simulation could've been a great game.
I don't doubt that a person's emotional investment in the team goes up with successive missions, but Thunderbolt Apache Leader and Ambush! give me that with games that offer lots of tough decisions and compelling chrome.

I found B-17 too much of an automatic game.  So much was rolled that you as a player had little or no impact on the game.  The dice determined just about everything.  I was pretty disappointed with that aspect.  There was no player participation or decision making!  You just went along for the ride.....

A grand little game that will keep you entertained for hours, if you buy in. It's an endless burr of charts and book keeping, to be sure, but, having said that, it has a certain 80s charm from the days when detail was boss and swift mechanics were a gleam in someone else's eye.

[Rated 2005/12/05, based on 7 plays]

I've seen complaints that this is a bit scripted, and I initially agreed when things were going right - your fighter cover keeps you out of trouble, you fly out, roll to hit the target and fly home again.

It then dawned on me that the game is really about what you can do to hold things together when it goes wrong - when your fighter cover is poor and you're surrounded, three gunners are dead, the pilot's wounded and the oxygen's out...  It's still quite chart-heavy with a quantity of luck, but very tense and there are decisions to be made.

Crazy as it sounds, you *do* get attached to your crew and start to really care about what those die rolls mean.

Nice little solitaire game. Can be rather bland as decision making is at a minimum

RATING: 4
Not a game but a simulation. There are very few choices that the player makes, rather many die rolls to see how many fighters attack you, what direction they come from and how damage they do to you. I dislike the fact that the player has very little influence on what happens.

Ron Plunk's B-17 events using this game make it interesting in that typically 20 people play, each controlling one B-17. The social element makes much more interesting. Ron goes to great lengths to add atmosphere and interest.

Simple and easy to get in to , but eventually the skilled player will see it for the memorization of tables/dice extravaganza it is.
Still its fun to play when you got a little time to kill.

No guilt trying games 30 years out of print on VASSAL and this one is great!  As a strategy game it's pretty much a zero.  But the theme and the suspense makes up for it in spades! Halfway through a 25 mission campaign and loving every minute of it.

RATING: 3
Maybe I just don't get this one. As a simulation it seems pretty good, but... I found it repetitive, lots of rolling dice and going from table to table.  There are just too many tables; gameplay seems mostly to consist of looking things up. Hard to say how much your decisions actually influence the course of the game.

I enjoy this game. For times when i want to play something and need some down time this is perfect. Roll some dice - see what happens - fly a few missions and hope to survive. Not full of decision making - mainly dice rolling on tables - but an enjoyable experience of "whats going to happen". You do get attached to your crew and hope for survival. If you are a solo game enthusiast then you should add this to your collection. A classic. I have not had the chance to play with a group and fly a group mission - I have read that is a great experience.

B-17 doesn't give you very many choices, particularly when compared to other solitaire games.  While this is probably realistic for how crews of B-17's really felt, it doesn't make the kind of game you'll want to play all the time.  That said, there's a place for games where you can play quickly and without too much concentration (the rules can be learned in very little time and the tables are fairly well organized, especially after a couple plays) while still caring about the outcome.  Not my favorite game, but one I find myself coming back to.

Rates poorly as a game only because there's not much strategy, you just hang on, shoot at what you can, and hope for the best. However that seems to sum up what riding along on one of those bombers mostly entailed, and you tend to get attached to your plane and its crew. Lots of fun.

The constant dice-rolling gets redundant, but the strong role-playing element and the tension of trying to get your crew out alive makes this one a minor classic.

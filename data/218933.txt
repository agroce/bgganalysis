RATING: 9
far superior to silver tower which has now been demoted to sitting on the shelf only to have the figures plucked out for use in hammerhal.
at first a little wary of the GM role being such a shift from silver tower, but this game just plays so much better. its not perfect..but right at this very moment. it is our go to crawler.
the inclusion of extra quests in white dwarf show how flexible this game is how much extra can be done/plugged in.

This game has quite a few small changes that I've really come to appreciate when compared to Silver Tower.

The story that takes up half the rule book does a FANTASTIC job at introducing you into the lore and providing you with the feeling of the different playable characters. I only wish it could be easily shown to other players right before play somehow, so they can experience the game on the same level I do with that passage.

The addition of a Dungeon Master Role makes the campaign run much more smooth and it ends up being much more exciting for the players as they're now battling against intelligent foes. Giving the DM a choice between actually using the behavior table or simply acting on their own is also a great touch, as it would get boring fast without access to any special abilities outside of weapon skills.

The special rules for individual tiles work fantastically to trigger traps as players progress through the dungeon, and I enjoy it far more than the old card based location exploring in Silver Tower because it feels more dynamic.

The new Search action gives a good additional option for players that don't want to reveal the next chamber right away, and it can really drive home the feeling of you actually progressing through a dungeon. It answers the questions of what you see, hear, and feel, while also giving you the possibility of finding hidden stuff!

The fact recuperating gets more expensive per wound you heal in the same round is a change I greatly enjoy, as it was too easy to just stitch right back up and keep fighting.

Visiting Cinderfall seems to be a great step in the right direction for where I'd like this game to go as well - that RPG in a board game experience I'm looking for.

I haven't played far enough to know just yet, but I also imagine that balancing is better in this game - since it forces you to use four characters. 

I can't help but always feel like I want more with these games though. More monsters to fight. More dungeons, and perhaps a clean way to combine Silver Tower tiles with this edition before I start house ruling and home brewing...I know that this game will eventually get a little stale as I get to know what every room, trap, and special event does, so I fear there may not be a lot of replay-ability here built into the box - which is a bit of a shame at this price...But who knows, I could be wrong. I thought the same about Silver Tower, but played dozens and dozens of times and still feels nearly as good as the day I got it.

This is an interesting release as a follow-up, standalone expansion to Silver Tower. This one is largely the same system except for the requirement of a game master. I'm fine with it being fully coop or one vs. all, but I do really see a huge benefit here. For one, the enemies are more intelligent which works in tandem with some changes to provide for a much tougher experience. Silver Tower being too easy was a criticism of mine and I'm glad to see that improved.

The second huge effect of a game master is an air of danger and mystery attached to play. Since you're exploring pre-built dungeons it feels a little more tense and the surprises come fierce. Traps and hidden rooms abound, adding an organic feel to the dungeon. The atmosphere of exploration is bolstered and I really dig the sense that you're making your way through an endless dungeon of connected areas. This grounds the experience and it feels more natural and less mechanical than Silver Tower's adventures. 

I also really prefer the four heroes and more substantial gryph-hound in Shadows Over Hammerhal as opposed to the six heroes and gryph-hound in Silver Tower. While the variety is smaller here, each hero ties into a 30 page novella which provides the spark for the story. This is fantastic and I feel like each hero has a personality heading into play. I also really enjoy the abilities and character of each.

New town rules are pretty good. They're light and streamlined, like the rest of play, but they give you a nice reverie and I love the return of the random event table. One of the few really bright spots of the original Warhammer Quest.

The main criticism of this new version is the fact that there's really only eight distinct quests here. You can return to areas and perhaps have a random encounter or two, but for the most part you have eight dungeons to explore. This is 16ish hours of play and that's a tad short for the price tag/content. The reliance of those awesome traps and surprise elements means replayability is hampered somewhat as well.

A lesser complaint is that I would have appreciated a more unified theme for the enemies. In Silver Tower we had the Tzeentch angle, here I would have loved to see a dedication to Nurlge or Khorne. Also not happy to see the main enemy be another mad sorcerer as that's a retread of Silver Tower to a large degree.

So close to being an excellent release... but sadly falls short in two major ways - both of which featured in its immediate predecessor, Silver Tower! (lack of random dungeon generation cards and an extremely limited bestiary, all comprised of previously released models - both of which could have been easily addressed, especially to provide a preview of a Nurgle-based chaos cult). But the game itself adds so many great mechanics to the base concepts introduced in ST. The gold mechanics, additional skill sets, grievous wounds system, and between-adventure city rules, are all fun and extremely well implemented. The tiles are beautiful (as always with GW), with a great premise for the campaign (a plane gate straddling two very different realms). If only the game came with 4 brand new (previously unseen) heroes, a less-generic model for the 'big boss', a few more enemy types (say a demon- and human-based tier for each of the chaos gods), and a larger bestiary for bringing additional models into the fray, it could have been a near-perfect release. As it is... just an extremely good one.

Really enjoyed this, when played in combination with elements of Silver Tower and additional content from White Dwarf magazine I'd give it a 9!

What you are really getting here is a gaming system that can be expanded on. Currently working on my own custom campaign.  Deep, yet light and casual game elements will have your party coming back to complete more quests!

So far I'm very impressed... it's structured but really allows the DM to raise the stakes and make things tense.  Watching the board slowly get revealed is exciting and while the game looks like 'dungeon saga' it plays much better. The city phase gives characters chances to play in character or break out of their stereotypes.

The numbers of enemy that spawn in at times is crazy but is seems to be survivable...
Very excited to finish the campaign and I hope they add more.

The best thing about this game over most other dungeon crawls is how few pieces there are. It has very little to setup and tear down so it's easy to get in a quick game. I also like that all the adventures flow together seamlessly but have spots where you can return to the surface... this really allows the players to control the length of the session. There are chances to interact with NPC's but I wish they would expand this even more (more dialogue options to express character)... luckily the results of those interactions effect things later on (no spoilers) ;>

- I ordered a copy without miniature from eBay for < $40. At this price the game is a great bargain. My excitement for the game might be less if I'd payed full price. Since I already own all the minis for the game I was able to open the box and start playing immediately. I wish I was able to do this more often with GW games.

Update:
My gaming decided to give this a try for our weekly co op game and it's going well so far. They tend to burn out on games very quickly but so far they still seem very engaged. My guess is once they feel like they have seen all the treasure they may lose interest. I may need to bring in the treasure from silver tower as well.

Hey, all. I never played miniature games before and would like to possibly get one I can play with my kids of 11 and 13 years in age. I'm flexible on the setting at the moment because if I have a few choices, I'll engage the youth on what looks best to them.
****************************

Warhammer Age of Sigmar and 40K are extremely simplified compared to what they used to be. You can get the 40K First Strike box for $40 which is a small-sized 2-player starter set. I'm sure Age of Sigmar has something equivalent.
***********
•I'm seconding the idea of buying a Warhammer or Warhammer 40K starter kit, as the rules on that level are quite manageable.
**************
Warhammer 40k First Strike Set: 2 player competitive, uses colored plastic snap-fit models so you can get started right out of the box, and the new 8th edition ruleset is super-accessible.
Warhammer Age of Sigmar Blood and Thunder Set: Same as above but for the AoS setting. The rules are simple but provide a good deal of depth. You could also grab the $10 Skirmish book to cheaply expand the game.
Descent: Same ruleset as Imperial Assault, but generic fantasy setting and can be played fully co-op with an app. D&D Adventure System Games: Co-op mini-based dungeon crawls in the D&D universe. A new one called Tomb of Annihilation is coming out in the next couple weeks; the last one was Temple of Elemental Evil.

Minimal prep but not out yet:
Warhammer Shadespire: A board-based arena combat game meant to be playable out of the box with colored plastic snap-fit miniatures. Going up for order in the next month or so, details here: https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/08/19/shadespire-previews-from-gencon-aug-19gw-homepage-post-1/
Star Wars Legion: New 40K-style competitive Star Wars miniature game, looks on par with X-Wing for simplicity but likely easier to maneuver for a kid. Out sometime this fall. More here: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/star-wars-legion-showcase/

More work to prepare:
Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower: Accessible co-op dungeon crawl. Uses AoS miniatures that you'd have to build and probably give at least a monochrome spraypaint job.
Infinity, Bushido, 40k, AoS, etc.: All competitive. Infinity, Bushido, and AoS (Skirmish mode) will only require you to build a handful of models. 

Based on what you're saying here, my top recommendation would proooobably be Imperial Assault, but it depends on what kind of setting you think your kids would connect with.

This game works really well as a dungeon crawler. It's a mix of very quick combat and most importantly exploration. 
I don't mind the loss of equipment gameplay element like in other dungeon crawl games. All in all those are mostly just dice modifiers. You still acquire random skills if you collect enough kills so this prevents that playing the same character gets old.
Where the game shines though is the exploration element. No dungeons set up in advance, no running past everything to get to an objective. Just explore the rooms, walk into traps, search for what happened in these rooms. 
I play the role of Dungeon Master and enjoyed this. It's certainly not as tactical as other dungeon crawlers, but it's neat that all monsters have special behaviours and different weapon sets that make a difference. You're more of a 'guide' and 'story teller' in this game. 
Lastly the town activities in between the dungeon crawling are plentiful and fun. 
Since everything is setup very fast, we decided to play this as filler on gaming evenings.

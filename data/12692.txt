I love the theme, artwork, and clear plastic cards in this game.  The gameplay is fairly clever, but the high luck element in the game holds it back for me.  A few of the cards seem abjectly broken (Body Snatcher), which also is annoying.

RATING: 6
Quite like this game, Gorey-esque plot, execute your family and make sure they reach their grave as miserable as possible. Transparent cards add a really cool mechanic, very fun, super easy to learn. Great with two people, I imagine it's even better with 3-4.

Nice theme.  Basic, but fun gameplay.  I love how the cards overlay onto the others to alter different aspects.  You can generally tell what someone has in their hand, so be sure to hold your cards in a way that your opponants can't tell what you have.

Fantastic storytelling game, where you have to get your family in the game to undergo more misery than other families.  I love storytelling games, and this one appeals to me the way the cards are designed, clear with spots covering scores and pictures.

Cool mechanics with transparent cards. And the theme sounds fun. But as non-native English speakers we all had trouble understanding the weird rhymes on the cards. We quickly started ignoring the card texts and thus lost the macabre humour as well.

Gloom is a decent game. It is a primarily luck-driven, take-that game. The theme is pretty clever and the clear cards are great differentiators.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty fun game. Too bad the quality of the cards is so poor.  The text on some of them is near indecipherable due to paint smearing.  This game would get more play if the cards were of better quality/ one could read the TEXT!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Card game - nice theme and nice innovation with those see-thru cards. Also clever idea to add the story telling to the game. It just get worn out after few plays - always the same card text -> always the same story. Don't know if this will be fixed with new expansions.

It's gimmicky. I like to show it off every once in a while, but other than that, it doesn't get much play time. Perhaps I should try the storyteller variant.

Morbid little game in the same style as the Addams Family. Relies heavily on story telling, which can either be cool or a pain for all involved. If someoen doesn't like story telling, or isn't good at it, they're not going to enjoy it. If someone is long winded...everyone else is not going to enjoy playing it.

Unique rpg-esque card game.  Dark humor.  Very interesting card playing mechanics (clear plastic cards stacking to change effects on base-card).  The goal? Make your family as depressed as possible before you kill them off. Whimsically gloomy illustrations.

RATING: 4
The first time you play Gloom, it's great.  The cards are funny, the see-through cards mechanic is clever, the faux-Edward Gorey art is excellent, and its fun to tell the stories about the characters' woeful existences.  But after you've seen all the cards a couple of times, the interest in the story aspect wanes, and the game itself is quite boring.  If you haven't played, totally try it a couple of times if a friend has it, but this isn't a game you need to own.

RATING: 4
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

As a general rule, I don't like take-that style of games and Gloom is no exception. Its theme might be different and quite clever and I see how someone might get a good laugh out of it, but for me it's just more or the same.

I would rather invest my time in something else, as this game doesn't have much more to offer than playing good cards on yourself and bad cards on your opponents. Not for me.

A nice story telling card game with dark humour! Lot's of laughter with this one. The replayability is OK but you tend to produce variations of the same stories. Not a big problem for the nature of the game but worth mentioning. It's probably best with 3 and 4 but it's also nice as a 2 player game. After all it's not a serious game to think about these stuff!

Bleh.  A very simple take that game with a twist (clear cards).  Any strategy is lost as you have to keep your cards below the table so the valued cards stay hidden.

The cards themselves are very poorly done and are actually painful to read due to the poor choice of colors and fonts.

We didn't finish the game.  It just wasn't fun.

I like the theme and the mechanics of this game.  I am a little disappointed by the interchangeability of the characters (i.e, they are all the same mechanics-wise).  Also, the theme and atmosphere depends on the willingness of the other player to "play" along.  Otherwise, it's straight min-maxing, which is done better in Blue Moon.

A game about trying to kill your family members after making them live horribly bad lives.  Fun game but there are some rule clarification issues with it.

Too much misery, and it's not all the theme.  I dislike the randomness, and I also dislike how the endgame can just build into the same cards coming out over and over and over.  This was the first game featured on TableTop that the video convinced me I didn't want to play, and after playing, I discovered I was right.  I like the transparent cards, but nothing else clicked for me.  There are better storytelling games out there - I'll play those.

It either needs to be a little more strategic or a little less tactical.  The macabre humor is great and carries the game for a while, but ultimately the temptation to number-crunch your options when your turn comes around causes it to overstay its welcome just a bit—even though it'll all likely be for naught by the time your turn comes around again.

Funny theme, neat components, and a good amount of strategy - Gloom is a winner.  The endgame does often come down to 'beat up whoeverer's ahead,' but since people are dying all the time, the game doesn't take forever.

RATING: 6
Like a dark humour version of Mille Bornes, combining "take that" and push-your-luck elements. It really relies on players buying into the theme and roleplaying the events on the cards, but it can be fun with the right crowd and in the right mood; it's one of those games that get better with a couple of drinks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Little silly, but sort of fun.  Your enjoyment will depend a lot on who you are playing with. The more the players' imagination creates the story behind the events played on the characters the more everyone is likely to enjoy the game. Nice artwork on the cards and really cool idea for the transparences allowing for a layered effect. The new cards, right out of the box, seemed a little scratched in spots making the already very small typeface even more difficult to read at times.

Really fun storytelling game that I think gets an unfair bad rap because of poorish card quality. However, I think the laughter, running gags, alliances and revenge that comes from this game make it pretty fun. It can run a bit too long sometimes, and you have to be in  a creative mindset, but I quite enjoy it.

The idea of transparent plastic cards is nice and the mechanics around it work, but the game itself did not get me on the first try. There is too much small text around in front of player to get a good grasp of what is going on, so it is difficult to make the best decisions. Maybe I would like the Cthulhu-themed version more?

RATING: 3
Much like its gimmicky, semi-transparent cards, Gloom's blackly comedic theme only partly obscures its absolutely wafer-thin gameplay. The Gothic humour is chucklesome enough, sure, but not enough to make up for the fact that there are almost no meaningful decisions to be made. More of a framework for making up stories than a satisfying game in its own right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Funny game with a great theme. To get the most out of it you really have to roleplay the game. But as a simple take that cardgame it's also ok. Allthough it might be a bit too long for that. The see-through cards are a nice gimmick.

The gimmick did not keep my desire to play this game alive. Traded it away.

The theme of the game really caught me. It is hard to read the cards as other folks have commented and I've found this makes it hard to figure out what the other players have laid out. I really liked the four player game a lot better than the two player game due to more chances for strategic play.

Fun little card game with a unique stacking mechanism using the transparent cards.  Card print quality could be a little better.   Also, can't see a whole lot of skill involved;  seems to mostly involve luck of the draw.

UPDATE:  After further, plays, and further looking at the poor quality of the cards (did I mention the fonts are almost unreadable in anything other than bright direct light), I've downgraded my rating (from a 7).  It is a cute idea, but it runs a little long for what it is, there really isn't much skill, and the component quality is poor.

Pro's:

1) The cards themselves are pretty fantastic, the art style and dark theme works well together.
2) Storytelling can sometimes be actually amazing, provided you have the right group.


Con's:

1) Very little game unfortunately
2) Arguably the storytelling is also a negative in that in my experience some players are really bad at it or become kind of frustrated or nervous about telling the story, in practice this means the game only works with certain groups.
3) Furthermore, there's nothing to actually compel you to tell the stories. Plus you have the added bonus that the best stories just make the game drag out forever and otherwise make you ask the obvious question of why even bother.

I like the idea of gloom, but the stories you tell are too disconnected from the mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The transparent cards are a great idea (they aren't desperately hard-wearing though), and I love the Gorey-esque atmosphere. Gloom has all the requirements for a great filler - quick, lots of take-that, lots of theme, lots of variety and just the right amount of chaos. The 'play 2 but only kill with the first' mechanism is obviously the result of good testing, alongside the fact that most good cards are balanced with a disadvantaging effect and most bad ones with an advantage. Minor gripe might be that some of the special event cards are a little too powerful but perhaps I am just splitting hairs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Theme alone, and the little pleasure that reading silly epitaphs and pieces of flavor text gives, is what makes Gloom shine, which would otherwise be a pretty straightforward game: play cards, draw cards, pick up as many points as you can, just on the negative side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Gloom is a really lovely game to play with your girlfriend/boyfriend. It looks beautiful and it's got a really wonderful sense of macabre fun. Most exciting aspects of it are the strategies you can use to win, and even then probably the best situations are when players reverse fortunes on a well-thought out strategy. I'll play this game a couple times a month easy

The idea of Gloom is much more clever than the game itself: Since everyone knows that the more misfortune one encounters on earth the greater is his reward in heaven, the goal of the game is to do horrible things to yourself (become widowed, lose a limb, contract a disease, have a series of unfortunate pets, etc) and do lovely things for your opponents (get 'em married, have them win the lottery, live happily ever after...). The player with the most misfortune points at the end of the game wins and goes to the highest echelons of heaven.
Very nice clear plastic cards that are played on top of each other in order to cover up +points and turn them into -points.

With 2 players this game is kinda fun, but when I've played with 3 it has been awful.  There were always more negative things (or in this case, positive) that the two others could do to you than you could make up for during your turn.  I've heard that's not as much of a problem in the 4-player version, but I've never had the opportunity to find out.

3rd playing.  My kids (11 and 13 like the game, especially the story telling).
It plays faster now,  I still dont think its all that good, but if I end up playing it 5-6 times with my kids I guess I got my monies worth.

PS - some of the cards relly screw the targeted player, and kids will not enjoy that.  I won a game by bringing my daughters best character back to life (costing her -65 points) while killing off one of my characters.  Then I proceded to remove all her modifiers on taht card.  -85 point swing.

--------
As a game it took far too long (especially with my children) and was not very fun.  Its very easy to overlook some of the long term effects of some of the cards (i.e. reduce hand size by 1, discard a card after each modifier card i s played, etc.)

On the other hand, my 13 and 11 year olds enjoyed the game, mainly due to the story telling.

With the right group, the story telling improves the experience.  Still not enough that I enjoy the game, but at least the kids will.

Sort of like "A series of Unfortunate Events" card game.

Bought this on a whim at the recommendation of a store owner who was trying to make a sale. Surprise! It's actually fun. I have some concerns about whether the printing on the cards will eventually scratch off with wear. Overall, a cute, light game about misery and death that looks very cool. My rating has dropped a little bit over time, though, because this has seen very little table time, even with the 'Unhappy Homes' and most recent 'Unwelcome Guests' expansions. There are other card games that I like better. Will try to get this out again in the near future and give it another... er... stab?

The see-through card stack mechanic seems gimmicky, but it does actually work.

The gameplay is ok, maybe alittle long, but could be very funny, except if your group is very very dull. 

The problem is that the replayability is low, because in a single game most of the cards will be used and the stories tend to repeat. There is a limit of stories you can tell that end in "attacked by manatees".

But for once in a while is funny and looks very good.

Personally, I found the storytelling to be a bit confronting compared to the usual play-style I've been brought into. I've also found that there isn't all that much in the way of replayability with Gloom, which I'm sure expansions would add; but I can't help but feel that once you've played all of those characters as well and all of those cards.. what then? However, I enjoyed/ am enjoying the confrontational experience this game is providing, and am looking forward to more hilarious and ridiculous stories that can be formed by different people.

If I have to play a content-driven, "take that!" style of game I'm going to reach for Gloom over... well, any of them (Guillotine, Munchkin). Obviously this is largely due to my preference for the Edward Gorey-ian theme, but I like the way that Gloom's flavor text, etc., end up telling little randomized stories about your sad family. It helps the humor hold up a bit better than similar games. Plus, even if it's just a gimmick, at least the translucent card thing is novel. In this kind of game that's better than no novelty at all.

Some of the cards are damned hard to read though, at least the edition I've played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's fun, especially if the group is willing to tell ongoing stories that build off of each other's card plays. However, I strongly recommend removing all cards that resurrect dead characters. Otherwise, the game drags and the tempo is lost. It should be a race to the finish, so to speak, and cards that undo progress? Well, they just suck. While you're at it, the Body Thief cards are cheap, garbage cards that instantly undo strong gameplay and strategy. The time for that kind of low-level, dumb game design is long over.

By the end of the last game, I ended up killing someone else's last family member off, just because it would end the game. I knew I wouldn't win, but the real victory was moving onto a better game.

If you were a fan of Addams Family or Munsters, here's your game. It's light, fun and contains a lot of interaction between players. You MUST read the flavor text, though. Tell the story - the game becomes so much more interesting that way. Then, after all your family is dead, play Bring Out Yer Dead to see how prestigious a grave they receive.

Very entertaining theme, really helps if everyone gets into the gloomy spirit to play.  Not an all star game for me, but I love playing the weirdo circus family and the Bearded Man in particularly always makes me chuckle.

Good game but it is another "screw your friends" game that if it isn't played with everyone in the same space it can make some people upset. Also the game is ten times better if everyone gets into the spirit of playing and working stories around everything that is happening. For example if someone plays a "blissfully wed" card on one of my family I would play the driven to drink card saying something like, And while Ted was enjoying the life of a newlywed all of us know what a money grubbing hag his wife is and as a result Ted was diving into the bottle to keep himself sane. The story will keep people interested in the game and always gets great laughs if you can put fun combos together.

Wonderfully dark theme and the way the clear cards are used as a game mechanic is intriguing.

RATING: N/A
Start with your family of odd-ball misfits and play cards that adds misfortune to them until they ultimately die. Alternatively, play cards that add happiness to your opponents' family members.  Once one family dies completely, whoever has the least points wins.  The game uses an interesting mechanic of transparent cards that add or cover up features when played on top of each other.  Players that add story flavor as they play the cards make this one even better, so get creative!

Take that!  And take some more of that!  Quick playing game that has lots of theme over gameplay.  The humor is indeed humorous, but only for so long due to the Munchkin Effect.  For the price, though, it is probably worth it if you like horror games in the lighter format.  I'm not really planning on getting rid of it, but I doubt I'll play it all that often.  Rarely played card games are much easier to hold onto than rarely played board games.

Unfortunately, the clear cards don't really "work" due to poor printing (values show through the back and card text is sometimes nearly illegible) but nonetheless a noble attempt...the gameplay is light and braindead simple but the faux-Edward Gorey (or Lemony Snicket for the youngsters) theme and artwork is irresistable.  Grim, macabre, absurd, and charming.  Game runs a little long and has little strategy to speak of, but  so what, it's fun.

The unique card management and layover idea is awesome.  Surprisingly strategic about where you have to play your cards, losing some boosts, comboing statuses, and killing off your family.  It can have a small amount of random luck of the draw involved, but trying to nail big bonus status effects right before the proper death wages well against the quick hitting points,  Best played when people have fun making an exposition as they play along, turning the family's cards and effects into an elaborate story of woe.

I really don't find much in this game. This just doesn't seem to be that good of a joke game even. I prefer Munchkin to this because Munchkin at least had more variety and options.

I love this game, but it's an acquired taste.

I love this game! Great for 2 players, haven't tried it yet with more than that. The only reason it's not a 10 is that the plastic cards are somewhat fragile. I'm worried about breaking them.

I'm really shocked at the average reviews this game gets on this website because man is this game original and an absolute delight.  You need to be a certain type of person to appreciate this hidden gem but if you love to tell stories and have a Tim Burton-esque dark sense of humor you will love this game.
The game absolutely depends on the company you have over.  If you have creative friends who are good at role playing, improv, and love to laugh this game will give you so many good times.  The actual game is very light and thrives on conversation and story telling.  However the translucent cards that you stack on your family members are very high quality and again very original.
I wish this game was more well known and got better reviews because it's definitely staying in my collection maybe forever.

I love the games theme. It's so completely twisted. I didn't think I would like the story telling aspect of the game. However it dose adds to the fun. You have to play it with people who wouldn't be shy with the story telling though. Otherwise they'll bog down the game.

I could never get on board with terrible games that are supposed to be good if you put enough effort into role playing/storytelling.
I'll play pure storytelling games now and then, but why attach a lousy game on top.

Might work in a sub 30 minute format but usually goes over an hour or more.

Gloom is a card game of dark and morbid humor. The goal of the game is to make your family members, represented by four character cards, the most miserable and kill them off before your opponent(s). It is a simple game to pick up and you can make a story about how the family members get their afflictions and how they die. It is a very good game and a lot of fun to play if you are a fan of the dark humor that the game is all about.

I really want to give this game a higher rating, but the poor print quality (1st ed.) and ambiguous special effect text are holding it back. With a couple of tweaks, this could be a brilliant game.

Update 12/2008: The reprinted version fulfills the promise hinted at by the first version. The printing is clear and sharp, some cards have been re-worded to make the actions unambiguous. Raised the rating from 6.5. I suspect a few more plays with the expansions may further increase the rating.

Perfect with the right crowd. The game is all about the atmosphere and dark humor. There's hardly any tactical options, and almost zero strategy.

I like this little card game. The theme of piling on pathos to your character before killing them off is really quite clever. Not only that, but you can really "screw your neighbor" too. The use of the clear card stacking is also very innovative. The Gorey-influenced art is outstanding and reminds me, in a way,  of the Lemony Snicket books too. The storytelling aspect if fun, as well. I really don't have many complaints about the game.

RATING: 7
I want to give Gloom an 8, but truth be told I can barely give it a 7.  It isn't because of the game itself though.  The mechanics of the game are simple and very easy to understand, teach quickly, and pick up at ease.  The gameplay itself is fun, but with stipulations.  

The fun of Gloom isn't in the gameplay, it is in the stories you tell and the pictures you paint every time you play a card.  It is one of the reasons I absolutely love this game.  You get to come up with RIDICULOUS ways to kill off each of your family members, trying so hard to make their lives hell, or trying to better the lives of your opponents' families.  If you have decent retention and a knack for storytelling, you can weave a beautiful tapestry of a tale.  Sounds like it should be at least an 8 right?

Well, therein lies the problem.  It is hard to get a group together that ALL enjoy the storytelling aspect as much as I do.  Some just care about the points and don't put any effort into embellishment, some just don't have the ability to tell a story, and some are just uninspired, to put delicately.  

Still, if I know I have the right group of people, and I know that we have time to devote to a glorious story, I will always recommend breaking this game out and having a nice laugh.

Quite a fun game - although I suspect that you shouldn't play too often or the flavour text (which is often genuinely funny) may get a bit stale thus reducing some of the enjoyment. The game itself is very 'take that' but there is some strategy. Appears to be some 'rule' issues (at least how we have played so far) around the end game - may udge my rating up a mark if these are resolved either by clarification or house variant.

The game has a strong 'take that' element which can cause issues with playing it as a family game - I have fiddled with a variant to try an ensure that no one player is excessively victimised by 'take that' hits, just to keep the peace when playing with the family.

My boyfriend loves this game but I'm a bit meh. The see through cards are a cool touch and the name of the cards usually raise a smile but there's just not much game here.

I didn't like this game.  The others at the table seemed to enjoy it, but I was just thinking about what game I could get to the table next.

I'm also lukewarm at best on the depressing theme (death).

Gloom is a darkly humorous card game with brilliant Edward Gorey art style. You have a family that is waiting to die. The more gruesome their suffering the greater their reward will be when they pass on. So to be kind to your family you must be as cruel as possible until they die.

the cards are clear so you can read the accumulated pain and suffering points as you heap on the troubles.

There is also an optional story telling aspect to the game. When suffering befalls your beloved family member you can talk about what happened and detail the lore. This option is sometimes skipped especially when playing with a 10 and 12 year old that love to hear themselves talk.

This is one of the first games I ever bought and I bought it as an impulse buy because of the game looks. And later when I took a look on the rules I thought the gameplay didn't seem to be very interesting. So the game was forgotten to my shelf for many years. I finally ended up to play it at pub because my friend had this game with her.

Half of the fun comes from storytelling. I don't see much game there and because I don't find myself as a role player or storyteller, I don't see much point to play this game if something better could be played instead. But this can be somewhat fun if played with right people (I'm the boring one who only reads what happened). By the way, plastic cards are nice idea when it comes to playing at pub but the quality of cards sucks. It's also bad to have transparent cards because opponents can easily see if you have a hand full of event cards or rip cards...

The game itself is fine; a bit of push-your-luck with a bit of take-that; but the real fun comes from the story-telling. If played with friends that have a good (or dark) sense of humor, and the ability to thread a good yarn, this game will surely conjure up some laughs. To what depths of misery and misfortune can you sink this family to, before ending their lives? If that question intrigues you, play Gloom, otherwise don't.

A take-that multiplayer card game. There's nothing here in terms of game play that's not been done in other such games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
[2 plays] Finally got to play this after having it on my interest list for years.  Glad I didn't break down and buy it for myself, as it is a bit of a one-trick pony, like Munchkin, where the main interest is in the humor/novelty of the theme and cards, rather than in the gameplay.  It's the opposite of Munchkin, though, in that it tends to end too soon, instead of dragging on interminably.  

I like the theme and the art, and the game is decently fun.  I wouldn't mind playing it occasionally, though it's not something I'd put in frequent rotation.

A combination of gimmick in the way you overlay clear cards on each other and take-that in the game play. The theme is fun the way you try to cheer up other people and kill off your own. Fun for a play or two, but no real staying power once the novelty of the gimmick and theme wear off.

Killing off your odd family.  Strange theme for a game, but somehow it just works.  Very fun to build up the story around how your family members die - especially when you give them the killing blow.  

Little slow for how light the game is, probably due to the amount of text you have to read on every card and all the interaction you need to account for in play.  Rules are a little unclear as well which hasn't been a problem as we've just house ruled any issues so far, but could be annoying to certain groups of gamers.  

Expansions are fun and would recommend picking a few up, if for nothing else to balance out the amount of death cards vs. other cards (another reason the base game may be a little slow).

Fun, but it depends on the group and how willing they are to be silly with explaining the situations surrounding the cards they are playing. Would probably be very little fun without that element. Bloody hard to read the cards.

Gloom is a dull, gimmicky take-that game with schlocky Gorey-inspired art.

From the food's-terrible-and-such-small-portions department, I'm sure I'm not alone in being annoyed by how easily the transparent cards scuff. You could have given me good components with my bad game, Atlas.

The box makes this game sound a lot more fun than it actually is.  And while it's not an awful game, it isn't something people have requested to play again more than once since we added it.  

A very simple card game where you have four "family members" laid out in front of you, and you play cards on top of them trying to lower their total value before you finally kill them, which awards you points.  Other players will play their own cards on top of you, or play an ability to make your life harder.  It is simple enough and can be learned while playing.

It is a fun game, the art is really well done, the card text is fun to read.  I am going to pick up the C'Thulu edition in hopes that maybe more exciting mechanics are inside.

RATING: 4
This is yet another entry in my ill-favored class of games which could descibed as a "Take that!" game.  Essentially, cards are drawn and the course of play is a series of unfortunate events played to make members of your family become more miserable while showering happy events on those of your opponents.  While original, this is nothing new.  The events are dictated by cards with wildly varying effects.  Some are better than others; if your hand is full of the strong cards, you will win.

I'm surprised such games still find a following.  Esthetically and thematically, the game works.  The flavor text and context is very amusing but there seems to be precious little reason to play this again once you've exhausted the waffle-thin suspense of play events, draw, score, repeat.

RATING: 2
The worst kind of take-that game, I'm disgusted that it was recommended to me years ago in a game store in NY.

It's full of reversing your actions, skipping turns, and cancelling progress, and really subject to the whims of the draw whether you'll be able to give any of your family members negative points and then wait a turn to kill them off with the right card.

The dark theme is a crutch.

Cool concept & theme, but not the easiest words for non-native speakers to have a blast of a storytelling night. However, we made some things up, and it still lead to quite an experience. Only played with 2 players so far, but I guess it's even more fun with 4.

Great Edward Gorey style art. I bought it for the very interesting transparent cards, which is a concept I always want to use for my own game inventions. It's basically about telling stories, so it's light on mechanics and requires players who will really get into the spirit. It needs everyone to be fairly quick verbally, and it's not one I want to play very much, but it can be a good party game. I can see it being a very nice ice-breaker sort of experience for drama types (but, really, drama types don't need ice-breakers, do they?).

A card game where Chaz Adams (The Adams Family) -like characters have horrible, no-good, very bad things happen to them through the laying down of cards from your hand.

The chief things this game has going for it are the art and the clear plastic material the cards are made from.  Beyond the looks, it's just another card game to me.

The one thing that would improve the game would be for all of the players to adopt heavy, melancholic, overly-dramatic ways of speaking when they laid down cards on the other players.  playing it up for all of the melodrama that it's worth would make for an entertaining game.

Exactly what I was expecting it to be. A charming little game, bogged down by old design choices and convoluted mechanics. I think had this game been more simplified it would of been better. which sounds crazy because its not as if its complicated by any means...but there is a lot of text. which, really slows things down especially when you dont know what something means. So, you find yourself just making something up to move things along. eeh, Its just not as good as it could be. Theme is great, love the transparent cards...really needs a 2.0 updated version with stream lined rules.

A fun storytelling game as a mix of Edward Gorey & the Addams Family where you tell the story of the family you have as they go through life to their doom. Yes it's a bit dark in theme but rich for an inexpensive game with tons of story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The length of the titles of cards played on family members tends to make one's (narrative) options feel significantly more limited than they perhaps should be. The overly specific cards force the game into a series of unfortunate vignettes instead of allowing players to formulate cohesive interaction between characters and plots.
In terms of strategy, there is practically none. Drawing untimely death cards can also be frustrating as players can be practically cornered into killing characters or be stuck unable to do so. Players try to put good (or less bad) modifiers onto the leading player's cards, but do so strictly at the whim of their draws. When players appropriately bash each at other, the game begins to circle the drain as modifiers start to pile up on characters and the powerful action cards become more frequent. Thankfully, the untimely deaths become more common as well, so the problem won't last long.
However, it is ultimately a dumb "take-that" card game that suggests players paint a terribly restricted story over its poor design.

Mechanically a very simple game. See-through cards offer some meaningful tactical choices, but most of the time playing is very straight forward. The attraction lies in the macabre theme of killing your gothic family after developing them a highly unfortunate life story. Because of the unusual theme and a relatively short play time (approximately 30 minutes), it is a pretty good form of entertainment.

I'm finding that I really hate "take that" card games.  Despite the BGG entry, this is not a storytelling game; it's just another case of drawing random cards and playing them on yourself or your opponents.  If someone is close to winning, stomp them if you can, ad naseum.  The see-through gimmick works well enough, except I could actually read through the backs of the cards if I tried hard.  In the very least, it was easy to tell if it was a modifier card or not.  I do like the art but not nearly so much that I failed to notice the utter lack of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game was made for me, or at least it looks like it was.  It definitely has the Gorey-look that I love, not to mention the macabre sense of humor as cruel fate befalls members of the different families.  The gloom for me was the game itself.  It's a great theme, but the game itself is dull.  The idea of the clear cards is nice, but many of the cards are very difficult to read.  I had high hopes for this one, too.

The gameplay is too light without much strategy, and the game is a bit too long. It is a pity, because we have had great fun with similar titles and I really wanted to like this one because of the beautiful cards and great theme.

RATING: 5
Great theme for a quick Halloween party card game, otherwise, not much here.
The rules change quickly and without warning like Flux, but the emphasis here is on story-telling and the interesting mechanic of the transparent cards. 
Unfortunately, that whole "transparent" card thing doesn't work all that well since: A, the "plasticy" cards slip and slide around, and B, they're only transparent for about the first 3 cards. After that, looking through them is a foggy mess, but it's a nice touch and works well enough for this game. 
The story elements are best served when you've got some quick-witted, quick-thinking players who aren't worried so much about winning, but more about creating a cool, wicked back story for each action they take. It can be really fun, and sickly funny. However,the rules bog down the game, and kill the sense of spontaneity required for just such improvisation. It's hard to keep track of what effects what, what symbols are showing on the cards,and how your current hand is affected by what has already been played.
I really wanted to like this game. 
Played it three times now.
And there it sits on the shelf, mocking me. Maybe the Gloom is revealed in your own mind when you realize you paid too much for this.

What drew me to this game was the quirky, Tim Burtonesque art and the cool clear card designs. Then when unveiling them, you get to read the great little quotes and mechanics to each card. Wasn't sure how the game play would feel since everything else was awesome, but it was actually quite a fun and funny game! I hope they keep coming out with more expansion packs, though they are not the easiest to find anywhere here in Ontario, which is not good and it should be easy. Love the Unhappy Homes set at least.

I thought I read somewhere here on the BGG that the cards of this game were too fragile, this I found not true. 
The game's components look solid enough.

The game itself has sufficient back humor to produce a chuckle now and then so I'd give this a solid "7", I cannot say if this game will continue to amuse me with further plays.

Excellent game. Very well balanced and fascinating cards. The "card stacking" aspect of this game makes for some really fun dimensional strategy. 

The story aspect of the game however is the best and worst thing about it.  When played with creative people it can be a hillarious romp. However, when you play with people who spin long winded stories it can become a real slog.  Especially with 4 players.  

The sweet spot for this game is 3 players with 15 second (max) natives.

RATING: 6
Gloom is a game about wealthy, eccentric families that romanticize tragedy to an absurd degree.  It is a game in which players must compete over whose family had the most difficult life.  Players do this by playing cards representing different evens onto their own characters, or by playing happy events onto the characters of their opponents.  As play continues, players will start playing untimely death cards as the final word on how each character's life story goes.  Once an entire family has died, players total up their points from their cards and the lowest score wins.

The scoring system is actually pretty unique and worth mentioning.  Each of the cards is translucent, and has point bonuses or penalties in different places on the card.  As you lay new cards on top of each other, some point bonuses will cover older ones, but others will show through the transparency.  The point bonus for each character is the total of everything showing through the top most card.  It's a pretty cool design that opens up some interesting tactical plays.

However, playing the game purely for points is actually really dull.  Even though the card design is a neat idea, it's wasted on an unimaginative point system that does not hold my attention for very long.  I play sad cards on my characters and happy cards on my opponents characters.  Hopefully my happy cards will cover their sad cards, and their happy cards will not cover my sad cards, and my sad cards will be sadder than their sad cards.  Maybe not.  It's a fine system, but a bit unimaginative and not all that rewarding to master.

It's better to think of this purely as a storytelling game.  Rather than just playing cards for their point values, tell how each event or untimely death happens.  This is obviously more fun if your friends are funny.  The game probably won't make you laugh on its own, but it gives you some good material to work with.


Even with the story telling variant, I do find the game drags on a little too long for what it is.  A half-hour would have been perfect.  By then, you kind of get the joke, and once that stops being funny, the game simply is not good enough to continue holding your attention.  I also find that the translucent cards, while very clever in theory, quickly become difficult to read when stacked too high.  This especially true of cards across the table, which are the ones players will most often need to read.

Still, with a group of players who share a dark sense of humor, this game can be great fun every once in a while.

Great theme! Everyone I introduce it to gets a laugh out of it.

The design is amazing all the way from the illustrations, the colouring, the see through cards (never seen this before or after) to the (flavour) text full of brilliant alliteration. 

Allegedly what makes this game really great is the storytelling, which hasn't really come naturally to me (yet). But without the game is fun too!   

Unfortunately, what I like so much about this game is also the reason I don't get to play it nearly enough: each see through card is chockfull of English alliteration, making it impossible to translate in order for me to play with my Dutch friends.

RATING: 5
Light & chaotic "take that" card game.  The clear card dynamic and the Edward Gorey arch goth-caricature artwork brings it up a notch from other of this type.  

BUT this game is more aggressively & extremely fiddly than others of this type.  This is exacerbated by the cards' graphic layout, which not only punishes those with poor eyesight (miniscule writing on cards AND glare if the light hits them the right/wrong way), but those who are color blind as well (all black and white with moderate colors, including one set of players' cards that is the same red as the other three sets when they are "dead."  

It's funny that I played this the same day as Pimp: The Backhanding, because both games are very similar. Novelty items, which may grab casual gamers who orbit the specific flavor or chrome. Above average production value, interesting theme, fun to look at, not fun to play repeatedly.  As a collector this game's an 8.  For it's gameplay it's a 5.  Plenty more "take that" light chaotic card games out there as alternatives that are easier on the eyes.

A darkly amusing backstabbing game, with a ton of chance and screw-you going on. The plastic cards and the way they are used is brilliant, but not uniquely so. This also makes them quite durable I imagine, which is another good quality. There just isn't a ton of player control, and most of the time, you are at the mercy of the other players. Some of the cards seem excessively overpowered as well. Neverthless, while it isn't a game I would pick to play often, it has a few great hooks to instantly draw people in, so you can have some fun with it on occasion.

It seems like it is an interesting and difficult balancing act to make games that are interactive: if a game is too multi-player-solitaire, players are all playing the system, but not one another (in what I would consider a meaningful way, above and beyond the end game score); if a game is too take-that, decisions made feel unproductive and players are almost encouraged by the game system to not place themselves in "bashable" positions. As a note, I personally lean towards games which are highly interactive where it is sometimes but not always productive to take a stab at other players at the table (i.e., games where there are rich opportunities for screwage, but ones in which there is either a risk involved and/or a small structural advantage to being on the bashing when all things are otehrwise even; e.g., Tigris & Euphrates, Through the Ages). I find that this game falls into the latter category in which player bashing ultimately takes precedence over productive actions for oneself (meaning that the game can accordingly stretch out far too long and overstay its welcome).

The use of transparent cards is really excellent and innovative. I also love how this is a "take-that," but when you do something bad to someone (or good for yourself) you suffer a penalty, so you must weigh things accordingly.

There's a sense of timing on when to kill people to maximize your score. overall, a really entertaining light take-that card game.

When I first heard the concept behind the game I burst out laughing. When I play this with the right group of people... I burst out laughing. The stories that are weaved about each family are priceless. The gameplay itself is probably sub-average (a 6 out of 10 maybe), but what really boosts the score for me is the creative storytelling.

(NOTE:  Comments refer to the 2005 First Edition; this issue has reportedly been corrected in later printings.  Not sure about the last bit, though...)

The idea is great, the execution not so much.  The main problem lies in the printing on the cards—it's small, fussy, and blurred.  Also, the card backs are not printed opaque enough to obscure all of the info on the front.  It's not difficult to discern what kind of card you're drawing next.

In the end the transparent overlay is a gimmick that gets in the way of the actual game.

[microbadge=3148]

HIDEOUS TOXIC UPDATE:  I went and dug this out—[i]ten years later[/i]—and found that the cards had done something stinky, sticky and industrial.  The clock turns all things to poison eventually; these just got to it sooner than expected.

Gloom doesn't get as much play with our group as it should, but only because it takes SO long for us to play -- because we turn it into a giant, silly-story telling adventure. 

I love the transparent, plastic card overlay design to keep track of the happiness of each character. The cards are funny and macabre at the same time. My only complaints are that after a few plays, seeing the same cards come up time and again gets a little old, and that the cards that "un-kill" characters really act to drag out the length of time a game takes. I think in the future we may remove some of those cards.

First played this on Feb 8th, 2007.  It's certainly unique with the clear cards.  The game consists of luck (cards drawn), strategy, and get-em factor.  It took us about 45 minutes to explain and play the game which seemed a bit long considering the game seemed to end quicker than it normally would based in the fact that cards just happen to work out for a short game.  It's worth a play, however the jury is out to play it on a regular basis.

The clear cards are a very fun concept.  The mechanics of the game are generally simple, although the end of the game can drag on a little.  The expansions aren't as fun as they add too much complexity for not much gain.  Telling stories as you play the cards can be hit or miss.  Sometimes you'll really be in the mood to do so, other times you'll just want to play the cards.

RATING: 5
Quick-playing card game with an interesting transparent card mechanic.  All players start with 5 characters which will receive modifier cards throughout the game which will give either plus or negative points.  Negative points are good as it's the player with the least points at the end of the game who wins.  Once a character has some negative points they can be killed, locking the score for that character until (potentially) the end of the game.

The game is very thematic, the flavour text on the cards will make you laugh, it's simple to learn and play, the cards describe their actions clearly - but it's all just a little bit too chaotic to be a great game.  You are able to play cards on any characters (yours or your opponent's) which is fine and adds some strategy, but it's the Event cards that I have a bit of a problem with.  They often turn your strategy upside-down, upset the flow of the game entirely and leave you scratching your head.  I think that they will get more predictable after more plays but they just change a game a little bit too much for my liking.

That all said, I still enjoy this game.  It's good fun and can be picked up for a reasonable price.

The plastic cards that cover areas of the main cards are really cool. This is the first game I have played with those type of cards. This game is morbid and I love it. Your trying to make your family sad so they can kill themselves and your friends want to make them happy so you can't.

I like everything about this game, except the game itself.  Its just take-that silliness.  Its suffers from all the classical problems of the genre: interminability -- with people piling on any early leader, obvious play with little decision making, fun derived from the theme rather than gameplay.  Its a shame, because the cards are actually amusing and cleverly constructed.

Odd game of translucent cards where the goal is to earn the most negative points for the family you represent and then kill off members to locked in their scores. Part of the fun is the narrative you tell to explain the negative events leading to your families slow or rapid demise.

I was initially turned off by the "yet-another-Gorey-inpired-style art direction".  Like many folks, I've grown pretty tired of Goth culture.

That being said, it works for this game.  The art, the gothic look, it's perfect.  The replayability is high, and we usually laugh a good amount at the stories of the hapless family members.

Additionally, the game is unusual, and inviting.  Who can pass up a game of transparent cards, in which you attempt to tell a story which makes the members of your assigned family as miserable as possible, before killing them?

I would give a much higher score to Gloom, except that after just a few careful games, my cards became extremely cloudy with tiny scratches. Also, as everyone complains, the font is difficult to read, which the scratches make even worse.  Better graphics would make this a nine or ten, and I would have NO PROBLEM shelling out the money to buy a replacement copy from Atlas without complaint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There are a lot of deck building games out there and a few good story telling games out there, but I don't think there is a deck building and story telling game out there that is as beautiful and creative as Gloom. This game is amazing. It's like living inside the mind of Edgar Allen Poe as you try to move your horrific pawns toward their doom in the silliest and most fun way possible. If you love Macabre, humor and story telling- you'll love this game. There will definitely be people who won't get the flavor of this game or won't enjoy the dark side of story telling, but in my house this our favorite story telling game by far.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really enjoy shared storytelling experiences and Gloom doesn't disappoint.  Unlike Once Upon a Time and Dixit, Gloom combines traditional rules with free form storytelling.  It allows games to remain consistent while also applying a level of strategy to them.  Sometimes you want to hurry and kill your family but it may be more tactical to penalize your opponent so he loses points.  The structure added to the genre is a breath of fresh air and keeps people from playing all their cards as quickly as possible like in some story games.

Very fun game where you are trying to make the members of your family as miserable as possible before killing them.  The other players are trying to make your players happy and then kill them when they are barely sad at all.

Once players are dead, no more modifiers can be played on them.  More fun to play with people who like storytelling games and are imaginative.

Unexpected find in Devizes Oxfam!  Is as new apart from the box having some sellotape holding it together.  Another storytelling game although this one is more of a framework to add your own elements.  That does mean it relies on the group more, also some familiarity with the cards would help.

Another black humor and funny party game. A delightful game of inflicting as much misery as possible on your poor little family before finally killing them off while, at the same time, trying to cheer up the members of your opponent's families. Mechanically a very simple game. See-through cards offer some meaningful tactical choices, but most of the time playing is very straight forward. The clear(ish) cards a a very clever mechanic for the game, and I especially enjoy it for its differentness.

Morbidly cute and the transparent cards are extremely clever, but not the funnest game to play. And the font size on the cards is too damn small (or maybe I'm getting too damn old).

Gloom is not a great game - its random, unbalanced mechanics are not enjoyable.

What is enjoyable is embracing the storytelling aspect of the game - having to explain the full details about why a card is being played. That is the game's intention and it certainly rescues what could be an absolute dud.

As long as one plays with a creative group, this can be a fun experience.

Fun game if you get the right group. I've played with people that really sell it when terrible things happen to their family member and everyone laughs, but I've also played with groups that simply lay out a card and say "he's dead" or " minus one" or whatever. That really sucks all of the fun out of it!

Since finding this in 2006 my game tastes have evolved considerably. I played again recently (2013) and had a horrible time. It is a very light game not worth the time investment.

Great game for anywhere from 2 to 4 players.  There is enough strategy to keep me interested, and with the right crowd there is a very fun story telling aspect to this game.  

The clear plastic cards make for an interesting game mechanic and the competition can get quite fast and furious.

I definitely recommend this game.

It's easy enough and I'd like to try it again with a few more people.  Could be fun with the right group but there's not a heck of a lot to the game - draw some cards, play some cards.

Gloom is best when you have a good group that engages in telling stories about their family's decline and fall.  What I find special about Gloom is that, unlike most story games, the game itself works, which helps carry it when the story falters.

RATING: 3
I can see why some people would like Gloom.  The cards are definitely different, and it's cool how they're transparent, but they're not very functional - readability is definitely a problem.  The game play wasn't as bad as I expected, but it definitely seems suited to teenagers, who would probably find the theme amusing (I don't), and who would enjoy the take-that aspect of the cards.  There is a definite timing aspect in the scoring, which makes it better than most card games kids would play, but it's just not my thing.

Gloom is entirely dependent upon the personalities of the people playing it. As a purely mechanical game, it is deeply dull. As a group story-telling exercise, it can be delightfully dark and pleasantly morbid, as tastes may agree.

I really like the art, but the game leaves a lot to be desired. Theoretically players should be able to create an amusing tale of their families as they go through one terrible encounter after another, but in actual fact it just didn't really have much of a narrative feel to it (and I was playing with 3 seasoned RPG-ers, all of whom are experienced narrative creators). Will probably stay in my collection as it's small and pretty, which is enough for me at present.

Random and probably pretty harmless card game where you play cards to modify or finalize the value of base cards, or to undo each other's actions. Rating after one 2-player game (which I won by playing an event card that was extremely overpowered under the circumstances) reflects that I have no urge to play it again soon. Nice flavour.

I have to say that "Mr. Giggles" is the coolest character name ever... :D The gameplay is purely based on luck, so it seems like the game could go on forever, if nobody really wants to "give up".

RATING: N/A
Like the opposite of the olde family game 'Happy Families', where you have to explain how your family members get into all sorts of scrapes and troubles, which ultimately make them more and more miserable. Then you have to kill them all off in amusing ways.

A great storytelling game, if you get the right type of players. If they don't delight in the stories or embelish beyond the words on the see-through cards, it'll make the game not as good.

This game just depresses me a bit.  The clear cards make for an interesting setup, but it's very black-humored.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are a few rules inconsistencies - a couple card combinations that, when put together, can be a little overpowered - and the rules don't address every point that maybe they should, but on the basis of style and the quality of artwork alone, this is a great game. I lost once and won once when I played this the first time. The clear cards are an original and effective way of keeping track of your chosen family's miseries, and a lot of attention was paid to little design details. I'm definitely going to try to buy this when I get a chance.

RATING: 6
A dark card game where you are trying to kill off a family.  heh  The cards are quite novel, since they are transparent and you can stack effect cards on top of the characters to increase/decrease points or kill characters.  The big fun thing to do when playing this is to narrate (by just making stories up) what is happening to each of the characters when you play effect cards.  Adds some fun flavor to the game.

Good storytelling game and a game that I think is suited for more than 2 people. You REALLY need to play with people who can get into the theme and can be imaginative and are good storytellers to get the most out of the game. The game itself is really straight forward and is easy enough to play, just have to find the right person or persons to play with to get the most out of it.

I liked it, but might not break it out that often.

Completely shameless ripoff of Gorey's style, but almost authentic enough to be forgivable. Nice lurching game structure, making your characters weaker and more miserable before killing them off, but putting yourself at a disadvantage during the process. Improved in the Cthulhu sequel, which trims a lot of the boring-modifier-only filler cards.

Storytelling card game. The cards are a bit unique as they are transparent and you add stats to characters by placing cards on top of each other. Fun game that often gives fun stories! However, this is a hate or love game. If one player hates storytelling, this game will not work.

RPGing on Harry Potter forums was where I started as a gamer and this card game reignites that part of my past. I love to get into character, weave stories, and win points while doing it.

Nice, unique transparent card mechanic.  The cards are _very_ thin, so handle with care.  Some people complain about having damaged cards out of the box, but I have had no issue.  a 4 player game may take a while if people dawdle about killing of characters.  Always gets a laugh, win or lose.

I love both the theme and mechanics of this game, but this was the second copy I had of it...after no hard treatment beyond casual play, the screenprinting on the cards deteriorated to the point of illegibility.

My daughter loves Gloom, and it has become a regular in our "family game night" rotation. We especially enjoy the alliteration, and play with that to hilarious effect. There is probably too much luck in the timing of your draws for this game to truly be called "strategic," but that's part of what makes it fun as a family game. The images and text are fantastic, but unfortunately I can't rate it higher because it lasts way, way too long.

RATING: 7
A fun light card game where you ascribe horrible events to your family in order to see them die and gain points doing it.  

Part of the point of the game is in the narrative you assign to each card so if you're looking purely for a mechanical game this probably won't do it for you.

RATING: 7
It's not a bad game considering it's an american game. But the quality of the card is not that great. Some I can't even read at all. I will try to get the publisher to replace some maybe. But gameplay itself is pretty cool, and it's a fast game with just 2 player. Haven't played with more than 2 yet, probably takes longer.

Great components, very Edward Gorey-esque artwork and fun captions don't save this from being a relatively mediocre game. Interesting overlay mechanic loses its novelty and you're essentially left with a point collection game with a small amount of "suit" bonuses. Ease of screw your neighbour tactics and random draws detract from what little strategy is present, but the story-telling aspect is not bad.

In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.

This is a game that really needs the right people to play it. If your group of friends just want a game wherein you slap cards down, end your turn, and move on... Well, this isn't your game. This game works best when your group loves to add a bit of role-playing to your card games. You are playing as a character, and these characters, and the horrible things that happen to them, are gold for role-playing seeds. This game CAN take hours to play, just because you can ham it up with every card flip. I would have rated this game higher, because it's right in my wheelhouse, but I really don't have anyone to play it with here. At least, none that would use the game for all it's worth.

This game was fairly fun, and the idea of the cards is neat in itself.  However, the cards do not play well around a table strategically.

A "take that" card game involving special effects in the text, varying levels of points that can be covered up or added to by playing more transparent cards on top of previous cards, and where the end goal in mind is the death of your "family".

Gloom has a few interesting ideas. The theme - dark and cynical - the transparent cards and the storytelling part were all attractive to me. However, the game in itself isn't much fun. It's hard to keep track of what's happening to each family, as the cards are hard to read - and therefore it is hard to make sure who's in the lead and define your strategy accordingly. Also, the average game tends to be a bit too long and the average player doesn't engage in storytelling, thus greatly minimizing the interest of Gloom.

This is one of a handful of games that I've gotten after seeing them on Tabletop. The gameplay itself is only meh, but the theme and roleplaying aspects are what really set this game apart for me.

Nothing fancy about the rules to this game, but the concept is brilliant (buy your way into heaven by having as horrible a life as possible), the components are gorgeous ad fun to mess around with, and if you're playing it with the right group of slightly morbid, literate types it can be howlingly funny. It's also a clever pastiche of Edward Gorey, and makes a perfect gift for anyone who likes his stuff.

RATING: 7
A nice card game, in which you play a set of characters vaguely reminiscent of the Addams Family, and attempt to make them miserable by playing cards which represent comically negative events.
It's quite simple in its basic mechanics: the goal is to gain the lowest possible score, by playing cards that either give negative points, or positive points.
An optional part of the game is storytelling: you can play each card inventing a background story for it, turning the game into something quite different, and, if you like wild improvisation, much more entertaining.
I enjoyed the experience very much. Recommended.

Great game...played with the right people. However, even if you have players that don't get into the story they can still play the game because the scoring does not depend on 'the story' you create for your family. The transparent cards that can be played on top of other cards changing the base card and modifiers played on top is innovative and fun. Fun fun fun!

This game has a couple of nice quirks to it. Firstly, the darkness of the theme really appeals to me (you are essentially trying to make your family of characters as despondent as possible before killing them off), and the transparent sections in the cards for overlaying effects is something I haven't seen before. The gameplay itself isn't amazing, unfortunately, but fine for the odd game now and then.

It's not just that the tea is cold, nor that the sky is gray...oh no, it's far sinister than that. The sense of the macabre fills your veins. But then again what's so wrong with graves? Quiet honestly, in this game, it's wrong if they are empty...but don't be misguided... this is not the work of a serial killer... it's just...life...
Surely the characters of the game are not your average neighboor, but then again who is? Let your deeper insticts guide you here, as you go through each of your family members more "creatively" than the last one.. you have to love the irony in it! The player with the most wretched souls wins the game, and pressumably a better place for them in the afterlife...not that you'd care ofcourse.

Enjoyable game with a fun twist having to make ones characters as miserable as possible before sending them off to their deaths. It just haven't got me completely hooked, so it's not that often it's played, but that could be due to other games in my collection just being a bit more addictive thus winning the bid over Gloom. Maybe I ought to take a serious of games with expansions? Beware of misery, Gloomers! I'm coming back for another game soon.

At the end of the day, Gloom is a disappointment. I love the concept (winning by killing off your depressing family in the most spectacular ways), the idea of the clear plastic cards and layering them to display modifiers, and the desiger (Keith Baker, D&D's Eberron setting).

In practice, though, the mechanics are not that special and the plastic cards are both annoyingly difficult read and incredibly prone to getting smudged and dirty. The theme saves it, and it's the most fun when everyone reads their cards aloud and gets into the spirit of it, but ultimately that's not enough.

Better than many other heavily themed card games. It seems they have managed to squeeze in some combos, so the gameplay is more interesting than simple draw-and-play. Imperfections: some of the cards are nearly unreadable, it's rather leader-bashy, and it's still largely about luck.

Sometimes, ratings are a funny thing.  I would not want to play this game very often, but it is definitely one that I will play if I'm in the right mood.  If you're feeling macabre, then you should seriously consider this.  Half of the fun is making up stories as to how your family is dying.

The game itself is fairly basic, but that works for this.  If you're considering buying this game it's worth noting that the cards smell *really really bad* when you first open them.

Great game - the storytelling aspect and macabre atmosphere is really what does it.  Wouldn't necessarily appeal to everyone, but if you're into it, it's awesome!  Also of note, physically, I love the cards.  Not only are clear plastic fun, but the material can stand up to spills or bending much better than cardboard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A light hearted, though dark themed, game of masochism. Very Tim Burton-esque in it's style and comic darkness. It's the opposite of happy families; you start with the family complete and must make them depressed before killing them off. You can play any card on your opponents as well as your own and the transparent cards makes for a intriguing aesthetic.

I tend to play a house rule where you can kill off characters with positive self worth, this tends to reign in players with a large lead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely one of the most morbid themes for a card game but that just makes it more unique and endearing. Lowering your families self worth before killing them off is a lot of fun but the real fun comes from the 'Take That' element where you mess with you opponents family. The use of transparent plastic cards is also a nice feature here.

The base game is simple and quick to pick up.  However, this is a very group dependent game.  Meaning you really need a group that enjoys the story aspect of this game to see it's full potential.  We did do a 5 player game which lasted 15 minutes longer then it needed to as we ran low on cards to kill of characters (but an expansion I'm sure would address running low on cards).  Overall if you have a group which loves story telling and joking around, excellent game!

-Materials/Construction - 7.5/10 - Plastic cards hold up great and shuffle like a dream but I had a few prints slightly off (working with Atlas to resolve).  The box is simple and cheep.

-Mechanics - 9/10: Loved the clear aspect of the cards and trying to make people miserable/happy while telling stories.

-Art - 10/10: Loved the art style, very Edward Gorey.

- Game Play - 9/10 (with stories) 5/10 (without stories): Again the story aspect of this game is what makes it fun.

RATING: 6.5
Competitive card game with the meta-design twist that you play "bad" stuff on your self and "good" stuff on your opponents and the player worst off at the end wins. This actually works in that it difficult to resent being done "good" by your opponents, making for a rather pleasant and strangly loving competitive exporience.

In its essence a Munchkin-style take-that card game, though as opposed to Munchkin actually fun. Suffers from problems of repetitiveness and lacking longevity from too few cards, leading to the same siatuations being repeated and recognised too often. This could conceivably be mitigated by including the expansions, which seems to seek to address this very issue.

The game by its very theme and its cards that presents narrative-like events invites story-telling, but is at the same time to restricted in setting and repetitios in gallery and events to allow true and novel stories to unfold and thrive, which goes against what the game seems to offer and frustrates creativity.

This is a fun game, but one play was enough for me.  I don't know how much more there is to get out of it.  Expansions would help, but there are other story telling games I'd rather play.  I find it to be a bad sign when I feel that I've gotten everything there is to be gotten from a game after one play.  I'm a massively gigantic fan of creative storytelling games, but this one is too limited by the cards.  I'd play again, but wouldn't ask for it.

This game was quite a lot of fun if you are willing to invest the creative energy to 'flesh out' the story behind the cards.  Clever overlay mechanism for the cards.  Artwork and text use copying the great, late Edward Gorey.  Will look to add this little gem.

I don't know what it is about this game, but I always feel like everyone's getting at me.  They aren't, but it feels like it.  I'm sort of meandering along, not accomplishing much but not doing terribly, and then suddenly everyone lands all their cards on me. :(.

Gloom is, more than anything else, a game of atmosphere. You can take the game out of the box, and put some cards down, and strategize, and curse the randomness of the deck, and it's okay that way, but it's also wrong. The right way to play is to go into detail. The right way to play is to evoke the atmosphere, to describe what terrible things are happening, to exhume and talk to that laudanum-soaked poet lurking in your soul and invoke his black words into reality. And, of course, that could just be my opinion, except it's also 100% right, and you don't get to argue.

Gloom was an instant winner with our family. Even if you don't play with the full rules, just creating the stories of all the characters is great fun. Everyone is invested in the stories the other players are weaving so that they can add their own little misfortune or happy event later.

The unusual theme of making a family miserable, instead of the common thing of having a blast is a bit of genious as it removes any potential nastyness from the game.

RATING: 5
Got only to play half a game; hopefully will the chance to play more of this soon. 

I like the concept, the art and the setting it gives to the storytelling; it's that same thing however that makes this game VERY dependent on the group you play it with (more than the average game) to get a good experience; also doesn't seem like playing it with just 2 would be much fun.

I want to love this game... The transparent cards are pretty and the objective of making your family miserable is fun, but I can barely read my own when they're on the table & can't read my opponents cards which makes it very hard to play (Yes, I tried putting paper underneath but I guess it's just my poor eyesight or something :( )

It's been a number of years since I've played Gloom but I remember laughing long and hard during the playing.

I also remember the stack-able, translucent cards being a draw.

Gloom is a simple card game during which you try to make your family as miserable as possible, before killing them off.

I enjoy Gloom. Combine Edward Gorey influenced artwork with Edgar Allen Poe storytelling and throw in a bit of backwards strategy where the goal of the game is to lose (and lose hard) and you've got a recipe for...something. I can be won over with a game conceptually even if the mechanics aren't great. Gloom is "fun", if dreadful macabre is your idea of a good time.

I don't really understand why this game does not rank higher. For a card game it has everything. Inventive mechanic with the transparent cards. Great artwork. Fairly simple rules, yet still a lot of fun with enough strategy to keep it interesting, but not so much players will take hours for every turn. Just the base game is a lot of fun on its own. The expansions add to it. This is one of the few games I have in my collection where I feel theme, artwork, and originality are all top scores.

A fun little game, especially when played with creative storyteller types.  I'd give it a higher rating were it not for two things.  Thing one, the fact that the card printing is extremely cheap, with many sections of the text being dulled out and really tough to read without a powerful overhead and strong eyes.  I've played two different copies of the game and both had the same print issues.  Thing two, the replayability isn't quite there.  I've played the game three times now and I feel it's already worn its welcome, despite seeming so interesting when I picked it up.

Really fun storytelling card game where each player controls a family of misfits, think different incarnations of the Addams Family.  The point of the game is to make your family as miserable as possible before you do them the kindness of putting them out of their misery by killing them.  In the meantime, you are playing cards on the other families in an attempt to spread as much happiness as possible.  Ingenious clear cards overlay each other and modify the values on the undying cards.

Our first try of this was rather uninspiring. The cards are difficult to read even when they are right in front of you. We nearly ran out of cards in the deck due to the number of Modifiers in play.

Played once. The theme is really fun (sort of a Series of Unfortunate Events kind of thing), and the transparent cards are a super cool mechanism, but the gameplay itself wasn't all that engaging, and the quality of our cards was sort of sub-par (the printed graphics were scratched and/or faded, on practically every card).

Would still be a great game for someone who was really into the Edward Gorey style art and theme enough to carry the sort of generic gameplay.

A simple and eye catching card game, Gloom is unusual and unique. The transparent cards have an extremely novel feel and look quite eye catching.

Shame it's own rules mean it's virtually impossible to finish as players will bring down a character enough to kill him, only for the opposing players to bring him back up again before the owner gets to kill him in his next turn.

A morbid (but not serious) card game. You have a 5-member family and you have to torture the poor, miserable sods as much as possible before finally allowing them to pass away. And you sabotage the other players by being *nice* to their families.

It's probably my favourite short card game - it's quick to learn and play, and the cards themselves are cleverly designed (they are transparent and you can just pile them on top of each other and the score will always be visible). I think the overall 'gloomy' aesthetic is nicely done too, it reminds me of the art of Edward Gorey.

RATING: 7
You're the group of friends who think that bridge is for cardigan-aged gamblers, Risk is too colonialist, Clue is fun but score pads are so Yahtzee, and Scrabble is for showoffs. You just want a game you can carry to a party, with maybe some strategy or maybe just luck, and above all, some good wholesome bleak humor. Because secretly, you all took your nicknames from Edward Gorey's "The Gashlycrumb Tinies."

WELL, THIS IS YOUR GAME! You each have a family of five. You have cards to play on the characters. Does that say "Blessed by the Bishop"? Oh no - that review was full of it - that's not funny at all! Unless you use it to cancel another player's fun in getting "Trapped on a Train". Which would be great, but would it be as great as having the paternal figure in your family get drunk on Drano? Decisions, decisions. How to inflict the most suffering on yourself while keeping everyone else happy is always SUCH a challenge.

Die! Die! Foundering in the fog and taunted by terriers! Alliterate your ailments and double your disasters! Counteract your cronies as they race to revivify your failing family!

Nitpicks: Second edition improves balance of 'gains' and consequences, but there still just aren't enough cards in the basic game, and we need some kind of marker system for tracking all the consequence variables - hand size allowed, etc. But on the whole, this is cracking good fun for the cracked.

For the sake of those anticipating this game, I'll report that from my playtest sessions with the designer, it will be well worth the wait.  The game is simple, but colorful (in a, uh, dreary way, I guess) and not without some nuance.  The clear cards should be an enlightening innovation for other designers, I would think; there's a lot more that can be done with that concept.

At one point, I was worried that Atlas wouldn't be able to adequately replicate the Edward Gorey artwork that inspired the game's creation.  But from the looks of it, the art is more than passable.

I won't officially rate the game until I've seen a final product, but for quick fun and great mood, I would give the prototype an 8.

As good as you make it! The joy of this game really lies in getting in to the stories you create. A simple card game but with a brilliant theme holding it all together. Each player gets a family, and their job is to make them as miserable as possible before finally shuffling them off the mortal coil by having them wander off in to the marshes or getting stuck in a well for days. It feels wonderfully British. At the same time, other players are trying to cheer your family up, introducing them to new loves and making them the heroes of the town. Which is awful. You don't want them happy like that. The theme of this game is second-to-none, with a distinct Addams Family vibe, and the production of the unique cards is brilliant.

This is really fun, especially if you're into explaining why your game pieces do things in games ("of course I'll take more sugar! How is Puerto Rico going to be the corn syrup king with crops like coffee or indigo or tobacco?"). As far as time goes: the box says an hour, but the game length is really variable. I like that you can force a quick game out of it if you want to without necessarily screwing things up for everyone else. I also like the way the cards work with the transparency -- I haven't seen anything like that before, and I find it charming. Very entertaining. I prefer it with three players instead of four: it's really a little nothing of a game, almost a toy, really, and the length of the four-player game feels almost like I'm putting a little too much into it for what I'm getting.

RATING: 4
Makes schadenfreud cute.  Very clever mechanic in which card that are placed on top of each other cancel, mitigate, and / or have no effect on previous cards.  I can see this being applied in many other ways (although I wonder if the mechanic has been patented). Imagine a game of Illuminati, for instance, in which mediating cards could be played on top of existing factions.  Anyway,it can be played quickly, and doesn't overstay its welcome, but I find it just a little bit too much of a one trick pony.  Trying too hard to be funny.  Instead it's just kind of repetitive and boring.

RATING: 8
A good game; can be played with 2 players, but is definitely better with 4; with only 2 players, the game gets to be pretty predictable since there's never any variation as to who the subject of an attack is going to be. Lately, when playing two-player, me and my partner have created a second deck from which we have to draw a card at the end of our turn and apply the card, good or bad, to any one of our own characters. That mixes things up a bit.

The rulebook encourages players to be creative and to come up with some narrative embellishments while playing, but nothing about the game enforces that and each card, in fact, sort of discourages it with its own flavour text, so I don't think that mechanic really comes through. 

A fun game, although a few mods may be needed to keep it fresh.

Played for the first time and had a good time. There is decent amount of story to be had in this, but I did find some of the actions on the bottom of the cards to be halting to natural play. There are several cards that have "Lose a turn" mechanisms to them as a result of playing them, and I personally don't enjoy that kind of aspect when playing a game.

A very good story telling game, but a lackluster card game. For me, the only way to play this is to create stories for your family.

Very fun to play, especially if everyone joins in on the storytelling part of the game, which just improves the atmosphere of the game alot. But as with most humor card games, should only be played once in a while or the humor get old and repetetive. Great party game too.

Make you family feel miserable (negative points) and then die. Nice!
Clever idea with see-through cards, but quality of the printing is somewhat lacking. I like the balancing of the cards: Cards that give you negative scores also come with effects that makes play harder, while the positive scores (that you don't want) helps your play.
Most of the fun is in the theme, and it increases if you are willing to storytell as you play. Great for goths, and even better for those who like to make fun of goths.

This is a very interesting alternative in theme:  driving a family with mental illness into deeper repression episodes, if not suicide of your characters.  It is just different and corny. The game mechanism is really greater with transparent cards that allow the player to add conditions to the character cards. Just it try once.  Matured adults required.

RATING: 7.5
Morbides, aber sehr kurzweiliges und launiges Spiel. Mittels halbtransparenter Karten werden Lebensläufe mit möglichst unheilvollen Schicksalsschlägen für eine Familie/Ahnenreihe aufgebaut. Dabei geht es letztlich darum, den eigenen Familienmitglieder ein möglichst grausames Leben und einen qualvollen Tod zu bescheren.

Spielt sich schnell und ist recht leicht zu lernen - und ist auf seine morbide Art sehr witzig.

Funny theme in this one.  You are a family that believes the more suffrage you experience while alive, will lead to a happier afterlife.  You want your opponents to get married, have kids, and generally be happy, while you want your own family to fall down stairs and have a bad day at work.

The game is fun, but it feels like it goes on a bit too long for what it is.  I would like to play this a few more times before I decide that this is the correct rating.

RATING: 6.5
Juego con mucha "sangre" y donde no se puede ser buena gente. Cuidado con las amistades, es un pierde-amigos. Recomendado para jugadores sanos que se toman los juegos como tales.

El juego es divertido y hay que tomárselo en ese sentido. El azar es muy determinante y la decisión de cada jugador de a quién putear puede llegar a ser también bastante aleatoria, por lo que quitando la gracia que tiene puede resultar frustrante para muchos jugadores ya que pocas veces salen las cosas como uno las planea.

A broad, bald, lame filler that last way too long. Yet people seem to like / tolerate it and will actually bring it up as a game to play. Do I live in cloudcuckooland?

There are few games that I'd like to play less than this -- I'd even rather play Cranium. I'll give it some points for being inventive and well-produced -- clear plastic cards allowing overlaying of buffs/points/etc.

Gloom is a very difficult game to rate, as I think the experience varies wildly depending on the group you are playing it with--and it needs to be a full group, not just two or three. Unfortunately, the more players you play with, and the more expansions, the longer it takes, but I can't help the feeling that time would pass very quickly if you gathered the right group of eloquent, witty people with equally dark senses of humor. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do that yet, so for now it gets a low rating, and I may not be keeping it that much longer.

RATING: 2.5
It's one of those games I don't like because you have to perform bad on purpose in order not to get attacked by the others. I already expected that, but what I didn't expect was the luck of the draw being that game deciding.

The only good part is the storytelling part, which means it's an awfully bad game, because it's the only part that depends on the players. Not everybody is committed to storytelling and the game is overstays its welcome: people gets tired of telling similar stories after half an hour and start focusing in the mechanisms. But the rest of the game doesn't work.

It's too long and repetitive to be enjoyable. I don't see it really replayable.

RATING: 7
Darkly hilarious game in which players aim to make their own family of characters, lined up in front of them on the table, as unhappy as possible; at the same time the rival families should be made as happy as possible. The "happiness" is achieved by very ingenious means: transparent cards can be played over the characters, covering different areas of them in which points or events are shown. This way, the original characters can suffer (or enjoy, or vice-versa) grisly effects caused by different cards, and these can be switched on and off in multiple ways. In the end all members of your family must die - the unhappier the better.

Even though Gloom can be played as a relatively easy and luck-driven game, its main appeal lies in the plumage - the stories detailed in the cards are decidedly comical (in a macabre way, obviously); linking the events in the cards while detailing the miserable stories that unfold offers players plenty of room to let their meanest fantasies flourish. Eventually the success in the game isn't driven by who wins or how brilliant the tactics were, but rather by the verve of the storytelling.

RATING: 3
A very macabre yet appealing concept, a truly unique card mechanic, and a game produced with a hefty amount of good humour which makes it easier to overlook its flaws. The flaws, namely, are a ridiculously florid set of rules, which I had to read four or five times before explaining the whole thing in two minutes, and the fact that the whole thing - underneath the skin - is completely derivative of other games. There's too much luck factor as well. A shame, but peculiarly also a shame worth owning.

RATING: 8.5
The storytelling game for the dark of heart. Artwork, characters, scenarios, and gameplay all reflect the charming macabre humor that this game relies on. Maximizing the misery of your family before killing them off--all while figuring out how to tie it all together to fit the story--is incredible fun. The only downside is that this game must be played with people who are eager to hand themselves over to the creative, extroverted premise. If not, things can start to drag fast.

A 'take that' game with an innovative transparent card design in which you attempt to make your family more miserable than your opponents' families before killing them off in dark and amusing ways.

Received as a present because my friends know how much I love the Edward Gorey style!

This game appeals to the side of me that may have descended from the Addams family. Gameplay is okay and definitely better with more people, but I've played with just two. More fun if you make the morbid story of your family humorous (which is pretty easy). My favorite part is definitely the art and the fun transparent card design. So nice to look at. Honestly earned an 8 instead of a 7 just because of my personal love of the art.

An ok game that works well in the right group. You want to play this with people who are into roleplaying or making up stories. And you need to play with atleast 3 to make the gameplay interesting.

The biggest problem this game has is that all the rules is on the cards. Which means that all you focus on while reading the cards are their value, and not the theme which is great.

An excellent spooky and humorous card game. You begin as a family of five very creepy people.
Throughout the game you will be modifying the pathos of each character with negative events that form their life events.
When they acquire enough negative points then it's time for that character to die.
The winner is the family with the most negative points at game end.
The negative events are what make this game such a good one for Halloween. They are humorous, yet eerie.

Novel and theme-laden, this game is unique in our collection for its narrative-prompting aspect.  Those crazy transparent cards are so funny with their dire fates and strange characters.  And it is just so funny to be trying to make your characters miserable and ultimately kill them off.  I look forward to playing it some night when we're more alert so we can enjoy the narrative-building more.  It cries out for some white fabric playing-mats though, without a white background it is difficult to see.

(1 play)  After only one play, I can tell this one will have a short shelf life.  The graphic design is just brilliant with the see through cards, but already from one play, scratches on the cards are becoming evident.  Bill pointed out that the theme of this one is very much the same as Edward Gorey's Gashlycrumb Tinies, but no mention is given in the credits - which seems strange given the similarity.  The game is morbid funny, and plays pretty well - but I can tell we'll get tired of it before long.

RATING: 6
Simple, silly game with a very grim theme. Despite that, a lot of fun. Note, however, this game will have people going at each others throats, and some people may be put off by this very direct interaction. There is a lot of craziness going on, plus the luck on the draw of the cards, so this is also not a game for people who like deterministic rules. Play it as a silly simple game and you will get the most benefits from it. Lastly, the one thing that gets hard is to read the cards from afar, so I would encourage people to place their characters close to each other so to allow for easy check on their stats.

The idea of transparent plastic cards at first seemed like a gimmick, but the reason became apparent while playing the game.  And what a neat idea!  I suspect we'll see other games adopt the idea in the near future.

As I am a huge fan of Edward Gory, this game is extremely addicting.  The only thing that makes it challenging is not the game play, but how the rules are written.  We played it wrong the first time because the rules were unclear of how to proceed.

RATING: 5
The storytelling aspect of the game is great, but overall it's just too gimmicky, and a bit too long and convoluted for what should be a short and simple game.

If you like 'take-that!' games with a funny theme, you'll love this. I find it fun, once in a while, but it's just not a great game.

RATING: 6
This game is a lot of fun IF you are playing with a group of people who will immerse themselves in the theme and will do some storytelling. I've had some trouble when playing with folks who simply won't do that, and without it the game is pretty dull. I love it, though, and the twisted justifications people come up with for playing certain cards make it a real scream.

RATING: 5.5
Great black humor on the cards, and the mechanic of stacking trasmparent cards is cool. Not much depth, but the simple rules are easy to teach.

Update: The strategy of this game is pretty basic, make your guys unhappy, and then kill them, and there isn't much room for long term planning. So the humor is pretty much the game's sole saving grace.

A very boring game, but a decent experience. The gameplay is very simple and uninteresting, and really only serves as a framework for the storytelling. The point of the game is to make up entertaining stories about how awful your families' lives are. I would only play this with people wh want to tell creative stories.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Its a storytelling card game, where each player takes control of a family. The goal is to make your family suffer the most misery before their death. And each tragic event you play on your family members like "Mocked by midgets" or "tried for treason" you must tell a story of how the event occurred and how it ties in with the other events the character experienced. 

And to defeat your opponents make nice pleasant things happen to your opponents family members.

I am so impressed with the quality and the mechanics of this game. It's ridiculously fun to play with the right people and weaving the stories for these characters can get downright outrageous. My only complaint: You can't play with everyone. You will have a friend (or two) who just doesn't grasp the story telling element or just cannot tell a good story. Obviously that's not the game's fault! It's lovely.

A solid cardgame with a fantastic theme and artwork which really is what makes the game fun to play. Reading out the flavour text on the cards is tremendously entertaining if played with the right folks with a gloomy disposition. The game is good as well and the translucent cards and the ability to stack one on the other with some still being visible etc. is an unique mechanic and the most interesting aspect of the game. HX

Flopped at the table. The story telling was kind of fun, but it mostly had the effect of making this poor game drag on longer than it needed to.

Played this again with some friends at pub. We'd already played a few other games and were having a lot of fun. This game came out and the owner started off with some really good story telling. We were ready to be wrong about the game, but it just flopped again. As with the prior play, all we wanted to do was get it over with, but people kept playing event cards to bring characters back to life. So amazingly boring. I'm reluctant to call it a game.

Really like the transparent-card mechanic. Fun goth/Ed Gorey-inspired art and theme, which leads to humorously appropriate combinations of tragedies to befall the characters. The game succeeds in both theme, and execution of mechanics. 1st edition cards are a bit too tough to read, but from the looks of the 2nd edition, they are crystal clear and would make the game an 8.

Requires the right group which is why I marked it a "6" instead of a "7." I'd generally be more willing to play it but I have had games that fall flat due to group members not being as into the story-telling nature of the game. Definitely a blast with right group.

hmm. just another take that card game. i like the theme of this one, but as is the case with most of these types of games, the theme is always more appealing than the actual game, at least for me. this game suffers from component issues too. the print is hard to read on the cards and the if one of your family members has a lot of cards played on it, the bottom layers can be very difficult to read.

This is a seriously underrated title. It's a fun game to play with friends and family. It's more about telling a story though, so if you play the game without trying to come up with inventive ways to make your families miserable you won't have too much fun with this title.  The plastic transparent cards are a nice touch, too. Unfortunately if they get bent at all, they stay bent, or break. Otherwise great.

There are two ways to enjoy this game: one, you're amazed at intelligent game design and thus drools at the concept of "see-through" cards which combine their effects together, and two, you appreciate dark humor and death- or murder-related jokes. I'm happy to report I combine both traits, and thus I've probably enjoyed Gloom a lot more than the average player. But keep in mind I've only had ONE try. I suspect Gloom's charm would not hold over repeated playing. The game itself is not exactly stellar or even new, but it's quirky enough to warrant a test-drive.

A silly theme of wanting things to go wrong for your "family" and being able to do some "take that" by having good things happen to your opponent. It really turns things on its head.

Very fun game for the right evening (and perhaps the right time of evening).  You play event cards over the character cards in front of you- your "family"- to make them as miserable as you possibly can, before killing them off in horrible ways, and racing to amass the most negative points.   

The cards are transparent, and feature a cool stacking mechanism with the points, but that's not what makes Gloom fun.  It's all about getting into the theme and weaving hilarious tales of woe as you play misery cards on your poor family members.  It's a good blend between a storytelling game and a "gamer's game", so people who typically are uncomfortable with freeform storytelling games can have a little more structure to work with.  

Plus, the game has a such a fun, macabre sense of humor that's infectious, similar to a Tim Burton movie.  This makes for a fun, relaxed game as you don't really have to worry about winning.  I could see making this a fun event game during a Halloween party, too.

Gloom is so much fun if you play it while telling stories about your family, replete with voiceovers. For us, it's more an engine for a great story telling activity than a card game, but so much laughter and some injokes make this a game I'll always be fond of.

Owned by Significant Other - Really fun game which appeals to the RPGer which I am at heart (and the gloomy bugger I am at heart). Nice theme, nicely executed, and enough thinking-stuff to make a decent game too. Gets a bit slow with more than 3-4 players, so the expansions are better bought for the variety and not the player-addition.

Thematically, it is pretty spiffy. But game-mechanisms-wise, I found it somewhat of a study in tedium. Granted, with the right crowd, this can be pretty fun. But I think I had more fun playing 10 Days in Asia than this and I'm not even that huge on 10 Days.

Although I normally enjoy the storytelling aspect, occasionally I find the time that it takes for an individual card to get played is just too long.  This fact aside, Gloom takes like 30 seconds to learn, looks great, and feels really innovative with its transparent cards.  Fun, but more of a light novelty game that I'd pull out as a change of pace between games that I want to play more consistently.

This game really shines when you've got creative minded, improvisational storytellers around you. The transparent cards offer a unique mechanic that's fun to play with, but the stories you and your friends will tell to explain your plays are what really adds the life and fun to this game.

If you game with serious, logical, mechanic-minded friends, this game probably won't be enjoyable for you. But if your group consists of people who enjoy storytelling, acting, or just coming up with crazy ideas, you'll likely really enjoy Gloom.

A fun game with a quirky theme. The card artwork is great - reminiscent of Edward Gorey - but the cards themselves are very fragile - prone to scraping, bending and other horrors that will ruin them completely.

I played with the guests expansion - I feel it balanced the deck and the unexpected deaths quite nicely (I've heard that with the basic deck it can get unbalanced). Depending on who you play with, this can be really fun! Not too heavy on strategy, at least my partners didn't really push me into coming up with proper thought-through approaches. But the theme and the see-through cards result in a quite unique gameplay and we always have many many laughs at the ridiculous misfortunes.

This is a good game but my eyesight is not up to the cards. You need to read the effects that are on the cards in front of all players which for most people means standing up and getting your nose over everyone's cards. the mechanics irself are fine and it wins on its odd theme which is well covered in this base game and the expansions.

Pretty standard take that game. We played storytelling variant which is the way to play, but takes some effort to keep the stories coherent. It also dragged a bit (hard to read cards).

The whole theme of this game is absolutely adorable. However, sometimes I find it difficult to "get into character" and fabricate stories on how Lord Slogar was Badly Burned, and I feel that without a willing group who will roleplay along, this game really falls apart. However, the cards are really nice quality, I sleeved them because I think that if you play too often maybe the image might start disintegrating off the plastic cards. Overall, a good game with a 3-4 creative minds.

I was pleasantly surprised by this mildly humorous, light filler. It's not something I would want to play regularly, but the rules are nice and clean, and make clever use of the transparent plastic. The main problem with the game is that the ink rubs off the cards, making them hard to read. Like many games of this type, it can also drag on a little too long.

Gloom has  pretty standard "ameritrashy" rules and it reminds me very much of Munchkin (seems I'm not the only one). It's the better game of the two thanks to the more solid game system. The transparent cards give Gloom a novel twist. Without them and the funny, macabre theme there isn't terribly much left though. It's really just an average hand management/take-that card game.

An original theme, make your family as miserable as possible before killing them (and conversely make your opponents happy) that encourages a storytelling approach. You play transparent cards on top of each other with certain scoring elements being blocked out by the card on top. Unfortunately, even with all these positives, the quality of the cards in the first edition isn't perfect with some printing issues and some of the detail is hard to make out. (The second edition may address this however).

Surprisingly fun, with a VERY innovative use of the clear cards.  The dark humour of the game is wonderfully sustained; I thought that several of the cards were downright hilarious, and that came as a relief, since I was afraid that the game might turn out to be mean-spirited.  But the Gorey-esque gothicness is mined to a 'T.'  If your fellow gamers are into the theme, the storytelling aspect of the game takes on a life of its own.  Yes, some of the print on the cards is a bit tiny, but I didn't find that to be a major annoyance as others have mentioned.  'Gloom' is just out-and-out fun.  My rating is based on a 2-player gaming experience; it may rise to a solid 8 once I can recruit more players to try it.

This would be very dry if all you were doing was laying the cards, the fun here is in using the cards to prompt you to create outlandish stories about your family and the various misfortunes that follow them. If you can buy in to the concept and get tale-weaving, this is a great, fun little game.

RATING: 5.5
An entertaining little card game that suffers from a terrible second print run that is rife with nearly illegible text on the otherwise novel plastic cards.  I've had the pleasure of speaking with John at Atlas about the problems in production and the solution they're looking for, and I do hope they find one.  Gloom would be a 7 or perhaps even an 8 for me if the cards were top-notch... here's to hoping!  As an aside, I've only nice things to say about Atlas -- great work, and they deserve all the best.

Edit:  new cards, good quality.  Revised to a 7.  No complaints!

Further Edit:  Once the humour has been played out, the game is only decent, nothing more, though the execution of the mechanic using transparent cards is still brilliant.

I received this game along with the tagline " it's a little different than the games you seem to like but I have no doubt you're creative enough with your friends to enjoy this game"

I did not enjoy the game, the person in question should have had some doubt.  In this game you simply go around in a circle with the other players playing cards on characters that increase or decrease their self worth.  The goal is to play cards to kill your family members when they have the least self worth.  The gameplay is boring and the decisions are uninteresting and as clear as the cards in this game.

The "creative" part of this person's statement refers to the fact that the rules suggest you string together a story about how these series of events happens to each of these characters.  Don't bother.  If you want to play a game that tells a story let me know and I'll send you a list of half a dozen better story-telling games than this one.

I lay this one at Wil Wheaton's feet. Actually, every game purchased from mid-2012 onwards is in some way influenced by watching his Tabletop series, which opened our eyes to a world of new games that we thought had vanished with our childhoods. Gloom is possibly the perfect game to me - dark and whimsical and creative - so it's a DAMN SHAME that after owning it for over a year and buying all the expansion packs on good faith, I've yet to play! This is horrible. Still, I declare it my favourite. (I even have the Duck of Gloom dice bag, for pity's sake!) UPDATE: Played. Love. Expectations met and exceeded. Insert 1000 black glitter hearts here.

Too much stuff on the cards - I like the principle of the clear cards with the dots, but keeping track of all the extra stuff the cards in you hand and on the table do is just too much work - it reminded me of Munchkin *sigh*.

This isn't an every day game, and it isn't a strategic affair. But it's one of my favorite take-that-style card games. It's light. There are few rules, and all of the fun comes from the amusing stories you and your friends put together. The best story-tellers will weave ongoing sagas of tragedy and retribution. Characters will fall to the deepest depth only to be lifted out of the muck by your opponents so that they can ultimately fall again.

After a few play-throughs the cards may begin to feel a little familiar and it might become increasingly difficult to find a fresh way to describe the grizzly scene that ends with one of your characters being eaten by weasels. People that play regularly may want to look to some of the many expansions to add more variety to their games. For the occasional player, there's plenty in this tiny box to keep you and your morbid friends laughing until all of the corpses have been buried.

Black comedy take-that game where players compete to have the most miserable (and dead) family. Each player has a set of character cards, representing family members, on which cards representing suffering ("wounded by wildebeest", "harried by hares") are played, followed at some point by death ("choked on a coconut").

Cards can be played on opponents instead, either as happier outcomes or inopportune deaths, or because they have tedious side-effects like forcing that player to skip a turn. Ridiculously overpowered event cards make things even more chaotic.

There's not a great deal of game here but the theme and supporting artwork are both delightful.

I've only ever managed to play this game once and it did not go down well at all. This game depends wholly on the players engaging with the storytelling aspect of the game.

Its a funny game, but I don't see any real lasting potential.  The strategy is very light, and plays become repetitive after a while.  The transparent card mechanic is very clever and novel, although I found it difficult to clearly see each opponents card combos, which is essential to this game.  There is a lot of straining to look at the other players' cards, which dampens the enjoyment.

Fantastic for story oriented groups! Playing and building off of your opponents as you try to find the most profitable route for your twisted family to pass away.

Gloom has an interesting premise and mechanically is pretty sound. Where it falls apart is in the story-telling aspect. Sure, you can make stories for your unlucky family, but doing so bogs down what would otherwise be a fast game. Give the cards a sentence as you play them and move on.

Man... this game is AWESOME but I really hate the card quality and their difficulty reading them.  While the card quality has improved ever so slightly since the first run (they blocked out the cards backs, you used to be able to see the values through the cards).  The material the cards are based on is poor, they come scratched up out of the box often with white stains on them almost as if they were left getting kicked around the factory floor.  The ink also does not adhere to the cards leaving them scratched off, this ink is also difficult to read at best.  As far as the game is concerned, I would have thought it would have gotten old once the concept died off on me, but it didn't.  Gloom has gotten a fair bit of play, I love the clear card mechanic.  The story telling aspect creates a wonderful time with the right playerbase, without people GETTING the story aspect or the amusement in the theme itself this game can get lost on some players.  As such my cards degrading quality has forced me to lower the games score .5 points.  Sad but true.

Screw your neighbour with transparent cards. Awesome. Gloom is cool.

You can't plan ahead efficiently in Gloom, because other players can destroy your plans so easily for example by playing a card on your family that reguires you to discard your entire hand. This is a fun game, not a serious game. Enjoy it as dessert after dinner with good friends.

Imagination and playfulness help with the story telling aspect, but in good group it doesn't matter if someone is not into story telling. He or she can still laugh at stories told by others. Story telling doesn't affect game play itself, it's just there for a funnier experience. If you enjoy "take that" card games, don't let the story telling part scare you away from trying out Gloom!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
My perception of Gloom may be altered by my single play, which was with a man-child who got really into the storytelling portion of the game. Admittedly there's not much else to redeem it. It has a cute, inoffensive, and readily reskinnable mechanic. That's about it. I could give it a try with less cringeworthy people, but under those circumstances I always have a better alternative available.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Conrad

Why we culled it: This is a tongue-in-cheek game of morbid/depression humor. It isn't bad - it is about as heavy handed as an episode of The Addams Family, which is to say it is all good fun. That said, the game was pretty light, and we never really managed to get into it. The transparent cards were a fun gimmick, and the way that they stacked to create "complete" cards was novel. I sent this one off to Conrad, who I'm sure will involve us if it finds a stride. Good times.

Gloom is another game experience that will completely depend on the players.  With players who are natural story tellers, this game can be incredibly entertaining, however, if you have a group who only reads the card and says they played it, then this game will quickly become somewhat dull.

I love the concept of playing with transparent cards. It's great. However the actual game is way too dark for my taste. I don't think the humor is that funny.

I have only played it with two players, I think it would be a better game with more.

I already played [thing=95234][/thing], but the normal [thing=12692][/thing], never before. Both games are basically the same rules-wise:
- You can play a card or discard a card;
- You can only play an Untimely Death as your first card (not counting for Events and special abilities that bend this rule);
- You can play a second card or discard a second card;
- You can pass;
- You draw cards from the deck until you are back to your hand limit;
- And most important of all: all the cards played must be backed by a story, connecting the family member your are playing it on with the name/situation of the card itself.

[thing=12692][/thing] is a storytelling game first and foremost. Sure, it has a winner, and yes, one can play only to win. But, for me, this is secondary. The story told is what matters.

And it is because of the story that I like [thing=12692][/thing] better than [thing=18723][/thing] or [thing=1234][/thing]. One of the reasons is because, of course, the dark humor. Also, the artwork and the way the cards work. And mainly because you have more control on the stories told. You can actually make an understandable story for your characters - sure, there are interferences and swings in some of them, this is a game, after all, and it is part of the fun, since this unexpected changes require thinking on the part of the players: to use them to their benefits, somehow.

In [thing=1234][/thing] I never feel I had any sort of control: I just try to take the story from point A to and weird-ass point B so that I can connect it with my cards in hand. In the end game, the story is a frankenstein-ish story, all sewed up with no apparent order or reason - we usually can even tell it to someone else, even right after the game.

In [thing=18723][/thing] the way the game is made, you can even tell a proper story - only a series of mini-events where you want to pass the story (the guilt) as fast as you can to someone else. However, it do form a (short) story in the end - with many swings. I like this one also, but [thing=12692][/thing] is just a step beyond.

The storytelling aspect is great fun the first couple of plays, but then it starts to get repetetive. There are only so many ways you can have someone be "Mocked by Midgets" or "Eaten by Rats". 

The actual gameplay is paper thin and very luck dependant.

After initially dismissing this game as a novelty, with the transparent cards, I have come to enjoy it a fair bit for the play. It suffers if played with people who take it too seriously though, as it works better when played fairly quickly.   

I am not very fond of the innovations in each expansion, save for perhaps Unhappy Homes, but have purchased them for the additional families and "standard" cards. I feel the new stuff doesn't really improve the game. It just makes it take longer, and there is more to keep track of, putting off the new/casual players that the base game is so very well suited for.

The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice—just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope—if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.

This game's success or failure is almost completely dictated by the players excitement and humor. If you play it by the rules, straight and without embellishment, the game frankly sucks. Add in some dark humor and give a bit of character to your family and suddenly all the players will be cracking up and enjoying themselves.

The cards are well made and pretty, and the style makes it easy to slip into the right feel of the game. A well put together game, all-in-all, but it requires effort to make it work.

Initial rating after first play with two. Love the card system and the original setting. Less fond of the great impact that some of the cards have -- these make the game a little more random than I normally like for this type of game.

This is kind of tough.  I thought the concept was great and I was really looking forward to the game.  After I got the game, I first noticed that some of the cards are almost impossible to read.  The color and font choices, while consistent with the theme, are otherwise terrible for payability.  I was also disappointed that you can see through the backs of the cards, and can tell more about the next card on the deck than you should.  Fortunately, I do not seem to have the quality issues that other people have reported.  When we played a 2 player game, I found it to be a light, and reasonably fun "take that" card game.  The transparency gimmick does add nicely to the game, but it is not quite as revolutionary as it sounded.  The playtime was appropriate for this genre, and if it wasn't for the hard to read text, I would like it better than most.

Isn't every game ???
Well , yes but some you can still enjoy even with some lame brained moody's just cos the game will move on with or without them.

A light hearted game with simple mechanics. Low-moderate depth of play. The quality of the cards are great and the way the game implements the harnesses the advantage of using plastic cards is fantastic. I am surprised there are no games that are building on the fundamental mechanics of this game.

Not an essential game to own even though it opened up a whole facet of board game possibilities to me. Again, I strongly feel that the mechanics of the game is underutilized by the industry.

This was the game that started my ascent into the board game world. It was a completely non-gamer friendly game that served to build up to a real gateway game. Certainly not the epiphany moment of the gateway experience, but it helped warm me up to the idea that adults could play board games outside of a standard deck of cards. 

I love the cards and the idea of storytelling infused in the gameplay, but ultimately it's just not that fun. Still, the theme is great and the cards are cool.

you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins. Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. Expansions: Gloom: Unhappy Homes, Gloom : Unwelcome Guests

Intersting trasparent cardplay mechanic. I think there is more than a gimmick here! I really liked the basic game BUT now that I have all the expansions it is not clear if they actually made the game a bit worse for me. 

Had some broken cards and to this date I have not got a replacement even though I was promised one!

Need to play more to evaluate this properly.

This is clearly much more fun when storytellin what cards do!
If you don't want to do that then basically you can lower my score by 1 or 2.

Fun with good storytellers. The game itself has limited replayability. It depends largely on new and creative ways to tell how the cards interact, so it's better playing with new people.

A perfect storytelling card game for those who love the gothic stories of Faulkner, Poe, Stoker, Mary Shelly...even Lovecraft if your mind is dark enough.  Rules are simple enough to teach a new player in only a minute or two.  Players must have good imaginations or willing to go out of their comfort zone to tell the horrible, sad tails of the tragic characters in play.  With only two actions per turn available for the characters, the game can potentially drag on longer than expected...but that just increases the opportunities to add more detail to the sad tails you are already weaving.  VERY HIGH REPLAY VALUE!

Played together with the unhappy homes expansion. The main thing i dislike about this game is that it was really hard to make a story with the cards. Everyone was coming up with sentences like X goes to Y-"read text on card"

EG 'there was a pond nearby. and he was attacked by ducks' or 'he visited the house and opened a door.. and was greeted by a ghost.' 

Would suggest to lower down your family members to 3 or 4. Was hard to keep track and intertwine all the stories together for 5 members and 5 players.

Maybe its just my group of friends. We ended up stopping the game to count scores as the no one killed off all 5 
of their family members even after the deck ran out. 

Other than that, the cards are really nice.

Gloom has the potential to be a fun card game but is unfortunately saddled with a few problems that limit one's enjoyment of it. I just find its pacing to be far too slow and I think part of the problem lies with the game's design (graphic and otherwise). There are too many circumstantial and interdependant cards and mechanics for what should be a light, silly card game and the resulting experience does indeed end up sapping your enthusiasm, just as the game's name might suggest.

Potentially a very fun little card game, depending on who you play with. The mechanics can be slightly clunky but with the right story-tellers the game is sublime.

While the design of the see through cards is clever, the writing is HARD TO READ. Last play the ages of participants was 29, 32, 35 and 52. Only the 29 year old could read the cards even in direct light. A geriatric version is needed. 

This is a good game I think appropriate for most people to have on the shelf... unless of course you are over 30.

RATING: 4
I really wanted to like this game, and the game mechanic is fairly interesting with the clear cards that act as modifiers.  The artwork is well done, and there is some genuinely good writing in the game.

The main problem is that neither the game mechanic nor the story telling aspect is good enough to carry the game.  Taken purely as a strategy exercise it's simply too shallow of a game.  As a storytelling exercise it also falls flat as well, largely because the storytelling aspect isn't woven deeply enough into the fabric of the game.  In fact the mechanics of the game often pull the player away from the storytelling.

I wanted to to like this game either as a casual but engaging card game or a storytelling exercise, but it's just too weak on both fronts to really recommend.

This game is excelent for 2 as well as for 4 players. Great way to spend a funny weekend laughting on the dark humor of the story. The cards have a nice artwork and the transparent plastic they are made of makes this a must have for any collector.

Card game whre you control a dysfunktional family that you wnant to kill. The first to kill its whole family wins. Dark humor fun. Pro tip: Vary the lenght by reducing to size of your starting family. Very good theme and storytelling.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting concept for a game but I have a lot of complaints about it.  First of all the cards, which are clear plastic with paint/ink/whatever on one side, scratch very easily so you damage them when you shuffle.  If the numbers or words scratch off during the game you can't use that card properly anymore.  Second the cards stink!  A real plastic chemical smell.  It gets on your hands after you hold them too.  I've had this game for a few years now and they still stink.  More production implimentation gripes I suppose.  On to the game.  I don't care for it either.

[microbadge=19675] I loved the art and the card stacking mechanic with the clear cards, but story-telling games always fall a little flat for me. I think I just usually prefer RPGs for scratching that itch. Picked it up at one of my very first PAX-Easts, and we only played once (at the hotel). 

Gave it to [user=051276]

A novel transparent card mechanic. But the game REALLY depends on the players. There isn't very much actual GAME here - it's more of a light cooperative story telling experience which, with the right group can be a lot of fun - but with earnest and serious euro gamers it's sure to feel VERY flat.

RATING: 5
After several plays, it gets stale. I LOVE story telling in games, but the story can't really deviate too much in this game :/

At this point, it is repetitive and stale. It has a similar feel to Munchkin, but instead of +1/-1 It's cover up negative/positive.

Nothing special, but it can be an amusing game to play at times. The cynical/dark theme of it can make it fun. Somewhat quick to play, it's easy to play but does have a tad bit of strategy depth to it once you become familiar with the game (though nothing too deep by any means). And frankly, the transparent cards are just cool.

Very good fun if played in the right spirit. Great transparent card mechanic. The story element isn't that strong, and in play the game feels more abstract than you think it should. This is largely due to the fact that it's hard to remember previous mishaps and happy events for multiple characters when they are constantly being covered by the latest card play. Plus the flavour text and character name text is on the small side and hard to read during play. Still a great filler game.

The game itself is a pretty basic take-that cardgame. What is special is the transparent cards that stack on top of each other. My copy had cards that were badly printed or faded however. I'm not sure if this is still the case for future prints. But do take note of this possible problem!

The game's not too complex (or as straight-forward as a game about making people miserable then killing them can be...). The possibility of story-telling definitely adds a lot of the fun to it for me.

Being a fan of Edward Gorey's art and humour certainly helps the enjoyment of this interestingly-themed card game. Your goal is to cause as much misery to your own family as you can, while simultaneously forcing good times, marriages, and happiness on your opponent. Wacky!

This is a game where style definitely truimphs over substance. The rules are not brilliant, and the cards can be sticky or difficult to read, but Gloom is still worth the effort now and then. Gloom is an experience game where the players make up a bizarre story through card play, telling each other why the daft card combos do what they do, to the weird and whacky characters. This game will make you laugh at times - and that is the point of it all.

The clear cards are clearly the gimmick here (see what I did there?) but there is enough going on with the actions to keep some interesting decision making and planning between turns in the game.  There is enough variety in the card text that it seems to have a larger replay of the humor value than the typical funny game... but regardless there is more game here than something like Munchkin... but not too much.

Good game that could have been great if it had been cleaned up a bit. It's very neat, just far too long for what it is. Games can drag on for 90 minutes, when it's really a 45 minute game at best. I think that it should be played with only 3 family members to correct this. Aside from this, the theme is unbeatable for creativity and components in a card game. Worth a try.

I really like this game a lot!  I am not usually into story-telling, but it works so well with this game that it would even appeal to those who are shy!

The cards are high quality, clear plastic allowing players to modify family members and still see the characters.  I think this is such a unique idea and really well executed.

The game play is fun, amusing, enjoyable and smooth.  Anyone who enjoys card games and screw-your-neighbor variations would really appreciate this!

If you like the Addams family characters and darker themes, this is perfect!

The concept is superb.  The Gorey-esque art is fun.  It's just a shame that these weren't met by an equally good game.  I think a more strategic, and less neighbor-stabbing game using the transparency would be excellent.  You just try to depress your living, and then kill them - or possibly kill your opponents' living before they can get depressed - first, hoping that other players don't undo your progress, or even cheer up your dead.  Yes, you read that correctly.

What a cute, fun game. So smart, with the acetate cards that let you develop a story for your bizarre family. Even non-storytellers can enjoy it, it doesn't exclude anyone. I have played cards that probably weren't the best strategy, but made a great story, and I couldn't resist telling it.

This gimmick of a game simply doesn't have the legs to get me to see past its gimmick. The version I have (which I'm assuming was the first printing) was horrendously done. Perhaps if the gimmick had been pulled off, that would have been enough...

If you, as a company, haven't figured out how to print on plastic cards, then don't do it. If after printing, you realize that the print job is mangled, then don't sell it.

This is the game that put me off of Atlas Games. I told myself that I wouldn't buy another one of their games, and I haven't.

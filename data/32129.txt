RATING: 7.3
A solid little game.  The ruleset is small, but some of it isn't very intuitive at first so expect to re-learn this if you don't play it frequently.   Still, the rules make sense, and once you get going the mechanics fade into the background and it truly does become a tactical dexterity game that is quite fun.

Deeper strategy and tactics arise through repeated plays. One game often turns into a best two out of three format. Good mix of strategy and dexterity.

I have my own homemade pieces and have 4 armies. This is EXCELLENT with 4 players.

RATING: 6
Players flick Carabande-like discs of three types (infantry, archers, and cavalry), each with its own movement and attack rules, across a table, with the goal of "killing" 6 of the opposing units. It's a clever idea that is missing something in practice. The archer kill method seems too difficult; flick two within a disc range of an opposing disc. The cavalry unit seems too powerful; flick an opposing disc off of the table.

Got for Christmas from some wonderful friends.  And on the right surface (somewhat slippery) this is tremendous fun.  Am a little concerned that the forces are unbalanced - the archers seem very very weak, while the calvary is overly strong.  Will need to play a few times more to see if tweaks are needed.  In the meantime, it's just a blast.

Apr10:

Only one quick play.  It's a cool little dexterity game.  However, there just doesn't seem to be enough strategy to me.  And without strategy, I'm looking for some laughs.  And I just don't see those either.

So... it's perfectly okay.  But not a gem by any means.  Maybe if there was a map and some objectives.

It's like playing deathmatch in a FPS.  Sorta fun for awhile, but I'd rather have something fun to fight over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game, but didn't like the Archer's ability.  Maybe with more play and more skill the Archer's ability would become more powerful, but as it was it was nearly impossible to kill anything with Archers.  Effective us Cavalry dominated our games.

Also, I didn't really like the idea of killing a unit by knocking it off the table.  This resulted in constantly searching for units on the floor.  I realize this is a bit petty, but being a guy with a poor back constantly bending over to pick-up units became quite annoying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Well-conceived flicking game! The game is clever in its simplicity. Three types of units, which each move and attack a little differently. There little logical connection to a unit type and how it moves/attacks, but that is no matter. The methods are different enough from each other - and each require a specific type of positioning - that there are always multiple tactical options on each turn to muddle over before making your move. Good one to introduce to non-gamers as well.

Really strong finger-flicking dex game.

A lot of fun, and versus a compatible opponent can be a real strategy treat, as well.

The only thing holding this back from an even higher score are more available scenarios and some other units to help replayability.  It's good where it is, but an extra unit type or two would greatly extend the options and life of the game.

Looking forward to Z-Man's version..could easily move up in rank with me to a 9+!

Wanted the game so bad, I made it myself.  Tell you what...it wasn't too tough to make, but it cost me twice as much to make as it would to just buy it...but again it isn't available right now.  Anyway...what a great game, fun for adults and kids alike.

RATING: 8
A simple, yet surprisingly nuanced flicking game, one that requires and rewards thoughtful play. Amazing what can be done with a few wooden disks on a tabletop. The positional situations that arise are sometimes much more complex than those encountered in other excellent flickers like [i]Catacombs[/i] and [i]Crokinole[/i].

Very aptly named: it's both "tactical" and "tactile." Looking forward to trying some of the scenarios but for now really enjoying the basic game. I've no where near mastered the archers, who require a considerably higher skill level than the infantry and cavalry. [12 plays]

A fun, simple and fast little flicky game. Rather than just 'smack your opponent' or 'get the puck in the hole', this game offers some tactical possibilities via its abstracted combat system.

RATING: 7.5
It's a tactical flicking game. Pieces are infantry, archers or cavalry, and all start off the play area. On your turn you either move (including bringing a piece into play) or attack. Each piece moves/attacks in its own way. The first player to ge 6 kills wins.The game plays pretty quickly and is an interesting take on the flicking genre. There are definitely some tactical choices to make. It kind of reminds me of that poker chip-tossing game, but simpler and more fun. There will also be expansion pieces like that other game, with their own powers. The base game also includes a few other pieces for more advanced play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A truly strange game. Certainly fun,  but with no clearly defined play area, and the rumored expansions don't seem to be materializing now that the game is owned by Z-Man. Not sure how to describe this one. It's a very good diversion, certainly,  but I'd describe it as a sort of "battle crokinole" without the board, if that makes any sense?

A cool and fun game. Maybe horses are too much powerful but it plays fast. It's very tactical indeed.

(Sort of "own": as it is out of print with reprint status uncertain, I made a home-made copy with Crokinole discs. Honestly, I think mine is better, since the iconography is clearer and it takes four players. None of the special missions though.)

I like Taktika a lot, and it's still simple enough that I can teach it to people who don't like rules (for whom Ascending Empires is too much like hard work). After their initial grumbles about too many rules subsided, the reception has been overwhelmingly positive. There are always fun decisions to make about potentially risky shots, especially angled ricochets, or playing it safe -- there are a lot more opportunities to go crazy than in previous go-to flicker Flicochet.

We originally had great difficulty killing anything with archers and have had more success house-ruling a longer range. 

Rating history: 7->9, after a dozen more games with 2p, 3p (1 vs 2 and round robin) and 4p (teams).

[Gizmet Gameworks 07 edition] {War; dexterity, player-elimination, scenarios} Taktika is a very fun dexterity game with tactical options.  The best flicking player may not win.  One has to position the army at the right place to increase win chance.

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

A slick little dexterity game that is clean, fun, and portable.  There are sure ways to deal death, and take control of the game, but the game really plays so quick, it is easy to play several in one setting.  Though it includes some standard dexterity game elements, there are a few novel elements included as well, such as the way attacks are carried out.  Great little game.

UPDATE:  In the end, crokinole wins out.  I hadn't played this in almost two years, so it got traded.

Anything that involves propelling game pieces across a table usually earns at least a six rating.  There are notable exceptions, but this isn't one of them. 

A strike against the game is that, unless you coasted through school on a flicking scholarship, the unit types aren't as balanced as they should be. My hypothesis is that the developers added the wraith tokens to help smooth over the game's rough edges.

The wraiths don't address the unit strength issues, mind you.  They're just cool - and shiny!

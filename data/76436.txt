It has aged better than I have.  It is quite fun, but it can drag at points due to long stretches of not knowing where the Bismarck is.  The battles are intense and it does a solid job of capturing the feel for the campaign.

My first ever board wargame and played the Basic & Intermediate games to death with a friend. Very enjoyable but maybe balance in favour of the allies. Tried the Advanced game which is based upon the Jutland system. Okay, but had a miniatures feel which wasn't really my thing (I didn't have a big enough table!)

Played this a lot back in the day. Brings back memories  playing lots of the advanced combat on the lounge floor. The game is a bit dated now obviously as there have been pc versions and boardgame versions that reduce the bookkeeping. At the time however it was a brilliant and accurate recreation of the hunt for the Bismarck. The game still holds up today and retains the realism and accuracy if you willing to accept the bookkeeping involved. Warning: Some games can be quick endings and/or boring for the Allies player if they never find the Bismarck as you just sit there calling out blanks until you lose, not very satisfying, but that's realistic so there are no complaints. Would definitely recommend to try get a copy and play for the experience and if you looking for an excellent and accurate recreation of this period.

Picked this one up a few years ago, always wanted it as a teenager. Now as an adult I need to find the time to learn to play it! Oh yeah, doesn't work so well as a solitaire game either.

Avalon Hill.  Good war game.  Bismarck is well designed and gives the players a game that plays well and keeps players on edge as the hunt is on.  Dice, charts, lots of ships and a good game system.

Played this once in the 80's and my Bismarck came upon the Hood.  So guess what happened?  Yup, the Hood took a critical hit and sank with no damage to the German ship.  I will always remember that. Would love to get this on the table again.

RATING: 7
For many, this game still remains the best overall simulation of the surface naval war between Britain and Germany.  The focus of the game is on the operational-level situation and there are a number of scenario possibilities, not just the Bismarck operation.  Plus, there are plenty of ships, to include some U.S. and French ones, to come up with your own situations.  Tactical resolution happens on a battle board, or--far better--on a large table or floor in a naval miniatures-type fashion.  

Only competition is Avalanche Press's SECOND WORLD WAR AT SEA game of the same name.  While the operational-level game is arguably better than the AH title, the tactical level game is definitely not.

RATING: 8
Captures the essential elements of the Bismarck's attempt to break into the Atlantic and the British efforts to hunt it down.  Visibility can help one side or the other--and then reverse which side is advantaged on the next turn.  Air and naval operations are blended together in a most realistic manner.

Me acuerdo jugar con él hace ya mucho tiempo. Tenía dos fases, una estratégica en un mapa del norte del atlantico para buscar el bismarck y los barcos que le acompañaran con la flota inglesa. Y otra fase táctica que entraba en funcionamiento cuando los barcos se veian y entraban en alcance de cañones.
De lejos, la fase más divertida es la primera. La segunda es demasiado técnica y lenta.
En general es un juego para marinos, que no les importe estar varias (bastantes) horas chapoteando. A su favor tiene que cuenta con toda la flota alemana, inglesa y algunos barcos franceses y americanos para jugar partidas inverosimilies o curiosas, por ejemplo con el inexistente portaaviones alemán.

Not a huge fan of naval games, they all seem like "Battleship" to me.  This was an exception.  The Advanced Game has lots of detail, great flow and miniature-based combat; all of which made it a great game.  Major downside was very little solitaire capability for anything other than combat.  One of the better AH efforts IMHO.

Not played.  A quick read through the rules looks like it would be a good game.  I've played a lot of AH games and they are usually well balanced.  This one seems to have its own flare, different from many of the standard ground-combat games.

As a long-time naval gaming fan, I naturally fell for this game. Certainly the hunt for the Bismarck is one of the most exciting and intriquing episodes in history, and this game lets you experience that event on mulitple levels. There's the "hunter and hunted" aspect both sides have as the Bismarck looks for convoys while also being the subject of a massive search. Once found, can the British bring a force to bear powerful enough to defeat the Bismarck? Will the "Mighty Hood" meet her historical fate? Battles can be played out in simple form on a battle board, or in miniatures fashion with detailed naval combat rules. Game offers a set of Optional rules which can be used to provide more detail during the search, should players desire. However, the Basic game stands very well on its own (many of the optionals are over-detailed and complex). This game is a must for dreadnought-era naval fans!

This is a very enjoyable game.  The only thing I found wanting was the basic combat system which unrealistically allowed British light cruisers to attrit down the Bismarck with gunfire due to the the lack of any armor penetration rules.  Obviously, this problem could be sidestepped by playing with the advanced combat rules.

Essentially two games in one.  The search sequence must be resolved before there can be battle sequences, which simulates the real situation in May 1941.

The search sequences require two players because of the fog of war element.  The battle sequences are essentially a refined version of the old game Battleships.  This portion can be played solitaire, to get a feel for the game.

I have it, never played it. It looks and reads like a better version of the original '62 version, but it most likely has lost a lot of the fast-paced action of the original - or am I just too lazy to learn it properly?

This is a pretty good game and has aged quite well through the years.  The basic game is fairly challenging and worth a play, but the intermediate game adds a lot of flavor through the various additional rules.  The advanced game is more of a miniatures based system that would be for those with a lot of time.

I played Bismarck with an umpire and with home rules to adapt the game.

The situation becomes more interesting for both players, but it's still an old game that needs more refinements to bring to experience to a good level of historicity and enjoyment. [My rating is for the game with an umpire.] 

I think the double blind version is not very interesting for the German player, because he is fairly easily spotted... and, once spotted, it's almost game over for him!

A naval war game classic.  Even includes French fleet units and a couple of American ships.  Many possibilities with this game that goes above and beyond the historic Bismarck chase.  Enjoy the search elements as well as the tactical combat board when units meet.  Beautiful components for its day.

I had this when I was younger and really enjoyed it, though I think I probably played the tactical game(s) more than the strategic stuff.

It was great fun for a WWII naval enthusiast.

Bought in 1980 when in New Orleans.  Played on the tugboat I worked on, then with friends ashore.  Came back to Baltimore and played it a lot with my usual opponent.  Still have it, but it hasn't been played in a long time.

Recently looked in the box and found notes and sketches where I was trying to make a Midway game based on these rules.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  Another oldie I played with my Dad when I was a kid. I don't recall getting many plays out of it; perhaps we didn't enjoy/play it as much as other favorites like Luftwaffe or Tobruk. I might have this in a box in the attic somewhere - if so, might give it a revisit.

Bismarck has its shortcomings, light cruisers have the same shooting range as Battleships, the "fuzz" of keeping track of fuel consumption & flight time and perhaps is the "luck" factor to high? On the plus side, I like the search mechanisms and it´s fun to play!

This is a strong game on a very interesting subject and lots of fun even when you lose. Actually I have never won a game of this, I was introduced to it by a friend in high school who became a doctor. No matter which side I took, he always won. After high school I picked up the second edition, however, I never found an opponent. During my purge in the mid 1990s I kept this game, I'm not 100% sure why, I didn't want to get rid of this game. If I found an opponent today, I'd play it again happily, although I would have to relearn the rules.

Outstanding game, about as good a simulation as could be imagined on this. Great components and adjusted detail levels to suit any tatse. Only drawbacks are the limited solo value of the operational game (double-blind), and perhaps some limited replayability. The are a number of scenario variants, but they all center around this operation.

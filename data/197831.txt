The artwork of this game and the miniatures are awesome. The game has very nice rulesets to cover the online game rules, but it is not enough unfortunatelly. The game at some moment gets really repetitive and the fact that you have to battle two bosses in one game accentuates this fact, and to be honest, it kills the fun out of it, especially after you have defeated the first one. An other big minus is that even though you have lots of treasures to choose from, the buying capacity is very limited, so you are not able to level up your hero as in other comparable games. On the bright side, you need quite good tactical skills to master each encounter and as such it has a very rewarding feeling after each successfull battle. The fact that the movement of the bosses is "programmeed" on cards turns this game into a memory burner: but I have to say it is a nice rule.

If you like dungeon crawls and like to plan out your turns strategically you will love this game. I felt like I was playing a video game but on a board. I thought the way the boss's  moved was very video game like. I think this game is very under rated. I had a very good time playing this game looking forward to playing it again.

Dark Souls is one of my favorite games and this is a great adaptation. The only negative would be that the treasure deck is just a little too big. This makes buying loot a little frustrating when you are trying to find usable equipment but all other aspects shine over that. Boss fights really make this game entertaining and keep the replay ability up!

At first many players I have played with were unsure about how they feel about the rules and the concept of the game (roughly around 50% of the players didn't know dark souls).
It took most of the player 2-4 areas with minions to learn the rules and to get a glimpse of the many customizable items. 
After the first boss encounter everyone started to get hyped and wanted to take revenge on him (if we lost, which was mostly on our first encounter with the boss) or enjoyed the legendary items the boss dropped. 

To sum it up: 

+++
The board game gave mostly all players I played with a welcome to the brutal dark souls feeling and everyone got hyped for the bosses. The heroes can be customized in many different ways and every time you find other items so no playround feels the same.

(-)
First time playing took raughly 1 hour more playtime
since new players need a while for looking through the many unlocked items and thinkinh about how to customizable their heroes to fully get the potential they found most fun and efficent. Also the game has many little rules which needs to be learn first.

-
Traps and barrels are obsolet. We couldn't think of any ways where someone wants to go to a trap or a barrel ... there is just to many ways to get around one so a way to fix this would be nice. Nonetheless it doesn't reduce the fun of speed killing (farming in 2 minutes) minions or challenging a boss.

Kickstarter with stretch goals - April 2017

RATING: 8.5
This game is quite well made. It does a really good job of making the game mechanics really easy to follow, whilst still having variety and complexity arising throughout the gameplay (in a good way). For example, each monster -  though it has its own sequence of moves and attack parameters, has its actions portrayed well through symbols on a card to allow things to play out quickly and intuitively.

The game feels fairly well balanced (if you play it correctly - I thought it was really unbalanced until I realised I had misread some crucial rules!) and offers a good sense of cooperative fun and adventure.

The main criticism is that the game can start to drag on and get a bit grindy in certain parts. This can be somewhat mitigated by sensible house rules of not needing to roll for things that will succeed no matter the result, and deciding to skip through some re-runs of low-level rooms to grind souls where victory is basically certain (pick your battles. Its better for your gaming group overall if you accept some shortcuts to keep things fun).

Overall, I'm quite impressed by the game. Sure, I have theoretically "better" games, but this one always seems to end up playing really well in practice and being fun for everyone. I am looking forward to the upcoming expansions.

Besides being lazily designed, Dark Souls is exploitative of the consumer and takes advantage of the Kickstarter system to deliver something overpriced and half-baked. 

Good: nice minis, and leveling up a character into a death machine is always a satisfying experience. 
Bad: gameplay is a one-dimensional grind with very few strategic choices available; a bit easy to min/max a character into omnipotence with the equipment deck; only four character options available with the base game, none of which are magic users. This last is particularly annoying, because it makes some equipment cards very difficult if not impossible to use. 

This all might be acceptable if the game was not crazy expensive, but it's inexcusable for a $100+ game. This is the only rating of 1 I've ever assigned, just because I'm so offended.

Only buy this if you love Dark Souls. The miniatures are great, but the game itself is... lacking... It's not bad! It's just that it's very finicky but doesn't really reward you for it. The dice mechanics make it feel like there's too much luck involved in a game that's supposed to be inspired by Dark Souls.

This game officially got me into Boardgames. I love the minis and the rule book is easy to read and understand. The game is co-op and you need to talk with everyone playing, but there is a single player mode. Its a game of patients and a bit of strategy. Don't get discourage if you fail the first couple of times. It will happen caus there is a learning curve on how the game runs and how to tackle the rooms. But learning is halve the fun here. If you like "programing" games with strategy and have 1 - 2 hrs to kill, try this out. Just remember its not Live of death, its what breaks first; Your will or the barriers in your way.

I know a lot of the kick-starter community are upset at how long it is taking for the wave 2&3, however the base game is absolutely solid. I've introduced 2 different gaming groups to this game and every player has really gotten into it, no matter how long we play for.  It takes a few hours but it is gripping. It's tense and exciting the whole way through and best of all, it feels like dark souls.

RATING: 2
after the first game (just played to the first boss) i would rated the game around 8.
so why a 2?
1. yes the game is hard, in the begining that is.. if you die in the first encounter you have a real problem (and thats possible) but if you have a good start and luck with the items you snowball super fast.
2. if you want to win you have to get as much souls as possible.. that means grinding, verry boring grinding..
3. after the first boss the game is so much more easy (unless i missread the rules(which are written badly, in my opinion))
4. if you are well equiped the bosses are easy, unless you have bad luck when they get inrage and 1hit 1 caracter with full health..

what is good?
the minis are stunning, there is nothing bad about them. nothing.
if you want minis this game is for you. I sadly want a game.

Kickstarted. Very good game. Better for the fan of the video game. Could be a lot better though. Still, the game is quite fun.

Edit: Well, after 4 plays which include 1 solo, one 2 players and four 4 players plays, I can say that the game is good but not spetacular. We use the house rules so this is why the game our gaming session were smoother and a bit shorter. But sériously, the developpers need to do a 2.0 version of the rules. At his current form, the game is incomplete, flawed and too grindy. IT's unfortunate that we have to house rules the game to have something. The mixed reaction about this game is justified.

Feels like I waited forever to play this game, and I'm a bit disappointed with the results. The game has some cool concepts, damage to stamina being one. And plenty of things I don't care for. The game play is far slower than I'd like or expect. I am pretty certain they did this in order to try and make it true to the video game, expect to die. The pooled souls felt like it dragged out the game a lot. Every time you go to spend souls there is a need for discussion, unless of course you are soloing the game. I changed the rules from 2 souls per player in the pot to 3 souls per player to the player, and they couldn't be exchanged between players, though they could share equipment, so you plan well enough it's like you're sharing souls. The game was still difficult but sped up a lot of things and made it feel much more fluid. This is the only way I will play it from here on out, it really eliminates a lot of tension that doesn't need to be there.

RATING: 2
A boring grind-fest that can result in you losing the game due to bad dice through no fault of your own.  Very little in the way of fun where you feel like you are a hero.  At no point did I ever get the rush of "well if you kill him, then I can do THIS and then you can do THIS and then.." (the sound of people high-fiving each other in victory).  You kill a room of monsters.  You take a break in a strange save point room and spend experience.  You then kill another room of monsters and rinse and repeat until you fight a boss monster.

The experience system is terrible.  Either a) get a piece of equipment that you 90% of the time won't be able to use unless you have increased your stats or b) increase a stat that gives you zero in-game bonuses except for the ability to use a piece of equipment.....maybe....if you've drawn the right equipment from the deck that matches you stat increase.

If you aren't into the Dark Souls IP then the drab board and super generic characters leave you cold.  The monster miniatures are all nice but this alone does not make up for the fact that the game is dull.  

You don't travel in the game - just moving from tile to tile with no agency from the game - so it's not a dungeon crawler.  I can only assume that this game is trying to be the computer game.  So the question is - why don't you just play the computer game?

Good port from the videogame. More or less the same, kill a lot of enemies, beat a final boss and die a lot of times to do the same. I'm not a pretty big fan of the videogame, nor of the board game, but it's original and pretty tense, but maybe too long.

This game is very thematic. It is a grind like the video game and it is very difficult. However, I do not think this translates well into a board game. It feels too fiddly and repetitive. The game needs many variants to decrease the grind that is necessary to get to an appropriate level and remove the randomness of the draw pile.

Played with double exp and merchant house rules, to make it a little bit short and less rng driven. a very fun experience that scales well with different number of players.

True, it still remain a bit long, but we solved that by "saving" our progress and do just a miniboss/boss run at every session. Plus the boss-only run mode variant suggested is quite enjoyable too.

Still a very fun dungeon crawler of a sort.

Only complaint is that if you didn't pledge this, obtaining all the stretch goals for a very good price, it's likely that you'll pay a fair amount of money to get all the new stuff (new calss, more monsters, more bosses etc...) since in the core game there isn't that much variability with non-bosses enemies. And the fear is that if you'll play more than 3 times you'll get a little bored in the first part of the game...

a 7/10 for a non darksouls videogamer, 9.5 / 10 for someone that do know that universe. Theme is that good.

RATING: 4
So far the worst example of this kind of game I have played so far.

Pro's
1) Great Minis!
2) Boss fight mechanics are quite interesting.

Con's
1) Horrendous downtime, in a 4 player game you are waiting 7 turns before you get to do anything, at which point your turn consists of moving once and attacking once only to wait once again. This seems to be entirely because all the monsters are glass cannons apart from the bosses, hit hard but die if you so much as breath in their general direction.
2) Repetitive as hell, this makes sense when you consider they are trying to recreate the feel of the video game, but just does not work as a board game experience.
3) Pointless equipment and lame levelling system: While there is a reasonable amount of variety in terms of gear, the vast majority of it was completely unusable due to the way the stat point + levelling system worked. I feel like playing much more into individual character specializations and splitting the equipment pile into separate decks to give you a few more options may have been the better approach.
4) Needs more hero variety.
5) Souls cost of upgrades is kind of ridiculous, makes the game 3 times as long as it should be.
6) Speaking of, the game is really long, and it feels really long.
7) What's going on with the rulebook and its layout, why are the rules in a completely random haphazard order?

As a solo experience (playing two characters), I've found Dark Souls to be quite an engaging and enjoyable game. But it must also be noted that I've only played with my own house/variant rules.

The standard rules as written in the rulebook have significant balancing issues, in my opinion. (EDIT: By "balancing issues", I am refering to the time investment to enjoyment ratio.) This is a prime example of a game that would have massively benefited from much more playtesting and openness to change on the part of the designers and developers. (I don't know that they weren't open to changes as a fact, but my gut feeling is telling me that someone on the team was being quite stubborn. And so, I may very well may be completely wrong about that. =]) However, I do recommend the standard rules to people who enjoy wasting their time and punishing themselves rather than house-ruling the game into something enjoyable and worth the time investment. (And I'm talking like an 8+ hour investment. Admittedly, I play games very slowly, especially solo, but "90-120 minutes" is utterly false, unless you want to play recklessly and lose within 2 hours... then perhaps... the developers never beat their own game?! Hehe...) I do understand that there are "purists" out there who rigidly oppose deviating from the rules as written, and those are the folks who probably dislike this game. (If you are one of those "purists", I highly recommend shaking it up a bit - you might find that that one game you hated from the bottom of your heart last week becomes your favorite game of all time tomorrow. They are supposed to be fun, aren't they? Trust me, it will be good for your Soul. =])

UPDATE: I feel like I should specify what elements of the game I found to be "imbalanced". Note that any "solutions" I suggest are aimed toward either making the game shorter or more enjoyable (which may involve making the game easier =]).

- 1. With regard to earning souls after successfully completing encounters, there is no scaling of the number of souls earned associated with the increased difficulty of encounters, and, more importantly, the increasing cost of improving the characters' attributes. This makes the game repetitive and drag on much longer than is enjoyable, in my opinion, due to players basically needing to repeat encounters to gain enough souls to make any sort of progress - "grinding". Why make a game frustrating and exceptionally time consuming when it doesn't have to be?

Easy and obvious fixes that I believe keep the intended spirit of the game intact with less frustration for players:
1. Increase the number of souls earned per player by one with each increase in encounter difficulty. For example: In a two player game, 4 souls for a level 1 encounter, 6 souls for a level 2 encounter, 8 souls for a level three encounter, and 10 souls for each mini-boss/boss encounter.
2. Number of souls earned = number of characters X 2 X the difficulty of the encounter. So as to not make this too easy, decrease the number of sparks given to the players during setup by one or two.

- 2. The treasure deck is all over the place.

While this game has gotten some bad press (or maybe that's just my perception), I have enjoyed it every time I've played it and am looking forward to playing more.  At least for me, it accurately represents the feeling of playing the video game, but is also a fun board game in its own right.  The boss fights are the highlight and are entertaining and challenging.

I'm quite unsure about this one.
From what I've heard it seems like the difficulty is not that balanced. You start a solo game with 16 souls. In a two player game you start with 0.
So, when you want to have 16 souls per player in a two player game you have to complete 2 runs through all rooms. This is equal to half of the game.
Yes, two players can cooperate and help each other but still I think that this unbalanced.

To win this game you have to roll good. I rolled average die rolls and lost pretty fast. Don't get me wrong I like difficult games and it is ok for me that you have to roll well as long as there are ways to mitigate your rolls in case they are poorly. This is also my problem with Orcs must Die!: you can't force the player to roll well everytime without giving him at least limited ways to mitigate the rolls.
Even Ghost Stories, although it is as difficult as a board game can be, gives you multiple ways to help you.

The minis look good, the cards and cardboard are of sufficient quality...only the plastic for the minis is too soft. Not like a soft resin but way more soft than Zombicide for example. Not a problem as long as you don't look at the boss with the hammer which is too heavy for the hilt and therefor bends.

The last thing I'm going to talk about is the repetitive gameplay. After you've built the map nothing changes. It is the same for every spark (or try), everything stays at the same position, everything behaves the same way...

First I thought the 6 might be a bit harsh but after I've read what I've written I feel pretty confident about this rating.

I've played this game twice now. I expected a fun dungeon crawler loosely based on one of my favorite video games. But I was surprised to find that playing this game feels exactly like playing the video game. It doesn't feel like its just the theme. The epic boss fights, the collecting souls to level up, equip, and upgrade items, and the great tactical combat, and of course the sense of impending death, where one mistake could spell your end. Then the reawakening where you begin again at the bonfire and have to grind through enemies to gain more souls and get back what you lost. If you love the video game, you'll love playing this with your friends or even alone because it has a solo version. I've done both now.

Excellent translation of the video game to board game. Great to play in a group (though the solo rules leave something to be desired), and if grinding is not your thing house rules are extremely easy to implement.

I'm a pretty rabid Dark Souls fan and was excited for the board game, so I can't escape a small amount of bias. I did a solo playthrough with two characters, and really enjoyed myself. I got a pretty good luck of the draw with the treasure deck, so I didn't get screwed like some others did. I was surprised at how little the dice dictated my gameplay. There are just so many mitigating factors to avoid making a bad roll a game changer. I often felt that my own stamina management and positioning was way more impactful than the outcome of a roll. I also liked the normal encounters more than I thought I would.

There are a couple things I don't particularly like. I feel like the game is begging to have a tiered treasure deck. It just feels puzzling when you clear your first room and spend a soul to get an item you may never be able to use. Additionally, I don't love that if one person dies, everyone dies. I feel like it really encourages quarterbacking.

All in all, it's a really solid game. I'm not going to give more than an 8 for now because I feel like bad treasure pulls and the draconian effect of a single player dying could be really off-putting to a new player, but these are things I think are pretty easily houseruled if a group doesn't like those rules.

Edit: after another playthrough, I have entirely different concerns about the game and decided to just write up a review. Dropped this guy to a 7, and feel like I've pretty well settled on that score. I'll try a few more games, but I'm skeptical my mind will change much.

With the rules as written this game is bad. The boss fights are interesting but there are so many flaws in the mechanics and the level of excitement quickly fades as the encounter repetition sets in. It takes far too long to play and the reward for the effort is not there. I love the Dark Souls video game series and the problem isn't that the board game doesn't capture elements of the video game. It just captures elements that do not work well in a board game. I'm hopeful the community will come up with a new rule set that makes the game enjoyable to play.

Sounded great on paper, but had reservations.  Still, it was worth pledging for the minis alone.  The playtime listed is a complete lie;  don't make any other plans for your first few times.  Gameplay is tedious, grindey, and clunky.... much like the VG.  However, the VG has breathtaking visuals, an unforgettable soundtrack, and a precision skill gameplay that is punishing but fair.  This is all lacking in the BG, especially with the addition of RNG.  The only thing that's worth it is the (unpainted) minis, that can be set up in a case, or used in D&D or another TT game.

Yes, the combat system is heavily dice dependant. But, while this game isn't perfect... at all, it's been the most raw fun of any game I've played this year.
If you're playing with 1-3 people, this is a 7-star experience, definitely. If you have a full table of tabletop gamers or Dark Souls fans, it becomes a 9.5 in my book.
The minis are also refreshingly different from those released with most of this year's games.

After reading and watching many reviews and opinions, I expected some kind of disappointment from this game. At the end, it wasn't. However it is long, it really begs for extra content and so on. So it is not perfect but it is decent.

I doubt how would someone -who never played the video games- enjoy the game because of its nature and many of the excitement is coming from the similar system, well-implemented mechanics and references to its origin.

The fact that all of the fixes, tweaks, and house rules - including those suggested by Steamforged - are all about _bypassing gameplay_ says it all. This is a borderline unplayable design that in a traditional retail environment would have and should have bankrupted its publisher. But because there are so many suckers that fronted so much money for this high profile disaster, it'll be buoyed along as "backers" clench their teeth and expect the expansions and stretch goals to somehow fix it. They won't. This game, even though there are some quite smart and innovative elements and despite some points where the adaptation is spot-on, has terminal issues. Not the least of which is the "loot lottery" which drives the entire narrative, development, and difficulty arc of the game. You people that put your money down on this rough draft of a game should be _furious_, not sheepishly trying to grin and bear it.

It's by no means a bad game. The quality is great(minus quite a few bent pieces on the minis) and the flow of the game is fine. The issue I have is the actual battle system, which is essentially just rolling dice. Rolling dice is fine in some games. I feel in Dark Souls, a game where skill is required to a degree, dice shouldn't be the deciding factor. And with how the game works, losing due to bad luck is frustrating. I'm an ultra fan of the video games, but this doesn't do much for me. I feel like they could've come up with a better battle system.

The components are superb. Gameplay not so. It's too random. We've played in a group. Some attempts we've died in the first room because the dice were not co-operative, sometimes we've breezed through the encounters to the boss and then the boss proceeds to hit with six or so consequtive attacks on a character and it's game over without any ability to react to it (single target attacks to the aggro target and then some AoEs). During our last game I had to go to the main boss wearing starting armor because the treasure deck didn't give out anything I could reasonably wear. I died in a few hits, again too much randomness, sometimes you dodge and sometimes you do not and get pummeled with 15 damage before it's your turn and chance to drink the estus flask.

We have now concluded that we will not play the game again until somebody comes out with sensible homebrew rules that fix the randomness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This is a great theme and setting but the games itself is tedious and poorly thought through. The boss encounters are well thought through and obviously where the game shines.

The level/world traversal portion of the game, which easily makes up 90% of your play time is poorly balanced, repetitive and fundamentally not fun. Everyone I've played with so far is never interested in playing again. It is just a boring slog of doing the same actions again and again.

This is bad. Real bad! 
 They managed to create video gaming grinding in a board game! No one likes grinding in a video game and grinding in a board game is worse!

You play until you die. Reset the dungeon and play the same encounters again. No story, little replay value just grind. The board is useless, bad graphic design. Tough to determine which spot is adjacent. Why do you need a board? You just need to know where you are in relation to monsters and other players.
Bloated, fiddly, boring! 

Out of my collection. This is the last Kickstarter I back I'm tired of buying undeveloped garbage!

Notes:

The dark, gritty theme of Dark Souls comes through really well with the help of great components. I felt that rule book could do with a rewrite as some of the rules feel a bit scattered through the book. A concise rules booklet would have been a nice to have. After a few rounds of play the rules come easily enough. The game leaves you wanting to play another round, but it is hard - make no mistake.

RATING: 8
Feels like the video game, challenging and fun.  A little random with the treasure draws, but when playing the video game blind, the treasure you find is also random and you need to adjust for that. Boss fights are definitely the highlight, hopefully the expansions make the grinding more fun ( it's not terrible if you are a fan of the game or a fan of grinding, but for those that aren't the variety in grunts, and addition of invaders, summons, and mimics should help the grinding be more fun)

As a huge fan of the video game series I was really looking forward to this. It did not disappoint. A steep learning curve and a lot of rules to get to grips with, definitely not one for people new to board games in general.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The game rules simply were not tested enough. It has quite some rules blackholes which as a solo/coop game can be exploited for a trivial playthrough. Some are answered in half-official channels, others are not. 
Aside that, the gameplay is not all that exciting, it's basically an XP grind, until you run out of resources or a bad rolls streak, and you then have to face the boss where you can "learn" how he behaves, but ultimately it comes down to luck of the dicerolls.
In a vacuum I might give it a 3, but because of the disastrous KS fulfillment and the greedy attitude of the company, it's nothing but a 1.

Repetitive combat and no sense of exploration or adventure.

I have played this several times. I have tried the rules that come with the game a lot and I find the game much too repetitive and long when playing that way. The grind loses a lot of its luster after a few times and after 2-3 hours just to get to the mini-boss, I feel like it needs house rules. I have been enjoying the campaign a lot with some heavily modified house rules to make the encounters, soul drops, and loot system much more enjoyable. With the modifications, I would recommend this game, but as-is... that is a tough call. I am a huge fane of the video games but this just doesn't translate well. The quality is great and I do love the minis though :)

dear lord, I really wanted to like this game, the mechanic is fun, but the game is boring seemingly pointless repetition. I say seemingly because if you don't grind the hell out of the lower level opponents you won't stand a cat in hells chance of beating the Bosses.
The rules are all in the rule book just haphazardly scattered through it.
The minis are nice overall - bit bent on arrival, but Hot/Cold water trick fixed them.

This game looks great as the minis are amazing but beyond that, it's kind of a flop. You battle monsters and level up and do this over and over until you decide to go fight a boss.

Cool minis but dated design choices like a single stack of treasure. Tactical combat is more about who can soak potential damage since the tiles do not vary tactics. Boss fights do encourage more varied positioning but players do a lot of damage quickly and boss fights seem to end as quickly as the medium to hard monster fights.

Little to no story. Haven't tried campaign but a lot of content remains unreleased. Didn't die at all except for final boss fight but dice luck factors heavily into it since lifebar is small. The neatest part is the stamina and damage system.

The designers did a fairly good job of porting the video game over to board game form. They just forgot all the escalating tension that the series brings. They forgot the sense of dread turning around a new corner. They forgot the beauty of exploration. Most importantly, they forgot Dark Souls (the video game) is a game of skill. The board game, sadly, is not.

The strategic depth of Dark Souls provides about 1 hour of interesting decisions - unfortunately it is a 3 hour game. Too much comes down to drawing the right cards and rolling the right dice at the right time. It's fun to build up your character and you do get a nice sense of progression during the 3 hours. It's just that the encounters that get you there wear on you very quickly.

Boss fights are also well done generally and can be a ton of fun when they go right. Unfortunately, I've seen them play out to be too easy and too hard because of the random assortment of attack cards, equipment cards, and dice rolls.

All in all, it's like the designers of DSBG got 75% of the way there and stopped. Sad.

Decent miniatures (good sculpts but low on detail thanks to the plastic) and good presentation. Rulebook is as good as can be; nothing amazing but it's easy to understand the core concepts.

Gameplay leaves much to be desired. Long and fairly uninteresting slogs against minions and mooks make up the bulk of the game, while the boss fights (which are interesting and well-done) only happen at the end. It essentially blocks the best parts of the game behind 'grinding.'

The core of the game is ruined by its dice.  I've only played a bit of Dark Souls, but - although hard - Dark Souls gives you a lot of control over your character. Randomness ruins DS: The Board Game because you don't have nearly as much control. Not to mention ridiculous stuff like finding gear you can't use means that one play will be WILDLY different from another.

Not worth playing when there are better miniature dungeon-crawlers. If you like the Dark Souls franchise, you can get it for the minis (which are very cool!)

This is a solid dungeon crawler.  It takes a looong time though and is grindy.  Also it has some imbalanced parts that could use house rules... and a lot of it comes down to what loot you are lucky enough to get in any given game.  I enjoy it but would not go out of my way to suggest it.

One play so far were we saw the problem of the "loot lottery" as we kept spending souls to flip cards without much luck at finding weapons (in a 3+ hour play). I decided to check the forums and see over 40(!) threads in the Variants folder already for this just-released game. We'll probably need to apply some of these for our next game. I'm willing to try it with some fixes and see if there's a game here or not.

Update: We sorted the items by category and drew randomly from whatever deck we chose. The items are odd in that some are simply better than others but you don't know what you'll draw. I just don't get the idea behind this loot lottery. What's supposed to be the fun challenge here exactly? 

As to the game, I'm happy to play a few times but probably one successful time through and my curiosity will be satisfied. The boss fight is so much more interesting than the minions. I wish more of the game were that instead of something you have to grind to get to.

Impossible to follow the rules entirely. Broken equipment acquisition system. You need to cheat the number of continues to beat this game. And a single roll can put you out of the round and restart the enemy room again just to retrieve your character. A game totally random controlled, it's all dices and a single dice with the wrong face can turn your dodge into instant kill. Unfair, a 3 to 4 hour game that is not hard to play, but hard to keep you entertained and willing to keep playing.

Oh boy. Gameplay has nothing to do with the computer game. Oh, ok, the boss fights are little tactical, but more memory and puzzle then a fight. And the boss fights are just 5-10% of the game. The nodes doesn't work fine for me, a hex grid could be better. The big part of the game is grinding souls to get levelup and better loot. And the more players, the more time it will need and the more downtime a player has. 90-120 minutes playtime printed on the box. Hell no! Maybe if you are very experienced. Double the time on beginning. The whole game is a big dice fest. Rolling dice all over. And with dice there is a certain amount of luck. In this system, which is basically a couple of decades old, it is a huge amount of luck. Dark Souls should not be lucky! But the boardgame is. 

There is a campaign mode included. Nearly the only thing changing is: You need double the souls needed to levelup and get loot from endboss. DOUBLE THE SOULS NEEDED. No, i don't want to roll dice for hours.

No, it is a bad game, but good production value. Maybe we houserule (double or triple the souls reward) the game to shrink time needed and grind needed. But the bad game mechanic on normal encounters is still there.

++ Minis are fine

I actually really like this game.  It's actually more of an abstract than a dungeon crawler.  It's long for what it offers, but with the right people, it's pretty fun and sort of addicting.

Not revolutionary.  But good.  I traded this to my friend but intend to continue playing it with him. My friend and I have had a lot of fun with this one.  

It's a game that NEEDS to be played rapidly.  As in, once you go back to a room you have been to before and I have figured out you do everything EXACTLY the same and just roll the dice and hope for the best and hopefully clear all the rooms in like ten minutes or so.  If you can't find someone to play with that can play that way, then DON'T!  It will take way too long.

Also, there is a serious problem with item progression that could be house-ruled.

The campaign mode is a mess.

Speaking of rules, they leave something to be desired.

And I think the only ideal player count is 2.  Maybe solo, but I would NEVER want to play with 3 or 4 people.

Yet, despite all that, there is something about this game that is different than any other 'similar' game in the genre that I can't quite put my finger on...

An extremely brutal pure co-op game that I have only played twice but have every intention to go back to.  

Pros: 
-Some very smart translations of the video games mechanics to a table top.
-Very nice components
-High replay ability 
-Fulfilling combat and decision making 
-Difficult to the point where I could see myself still losing on occasion even after being well practiced in it. There is quite a lot of risk management in every decision.


Cons:
-More RNG then I would like from the variance in the dice and the sheer amount of loot makes it hard to pull something your group is lacking in
-Quite a long game,  I am sure we will get quicker the more we play like other big games but as it stands it was about 6-7 hours for a game.

While it feels like an earnest attempt to bring the video games to life on the tabletop, there's some fundamental issues here that keep it from being a great game.   It can be too hard or too easy, depending on the number of characters and which items are drawn from the treasure deck.  The components are spectacular, but the small treasure cards with numerous tiny icons are annoying.  It takes forever to play and should have been designed with campaign play in mind to make sessions shorter and more manageable.   Combat is heavy on dice-rolling but still becomes dry and deterministic too quickly.  Works best with one or two players; with more players it's too long and the most experienced player will probably need to quarterback to keep everyone alive.    I'm hopeful that the additional content from the Kickstarter will liven up the game a bit.  I would definitely not recommend buying this at retail as it'll cost you a fortune to get a decent amount of content.

After a few more plays, I'm finding I'm liking the game less and less.  In solo mode, it seems like there are two possible ways for the game to play out:  you (randomly) get some good equipment early on and the game becomes easy, or you (randomly) never get any useful equipment and the game is essentially impossible.   Neither outcome is very satisfying.   

In non-solo mode, you're stuck with your default equipment until you win an encounter or two, which means - once again - those first few random draws from the treasure deck can make or break your efforts.  It seems like such an obvious flaw, I'm not sure what the designers were thinking.  The treasure deck really needs to be modified based on not only the character classes, but also the number of players.

Better than expected. I've played a fast advance house rule with only one restart because I'm not a fan of grinding for souls. Basically, you only want to play the grunt encounters one time, two tops, to see if they force you to spend some of your one-use resources (they aren't really threathening) before the main event. The bosses are the stars of the game and the battles are more tactical, yet accesible enough for non-gamers.

It's a shame I'd to wait till december to get my copy (spanish edition here), but at least the new translation is pretty good bar a couple of misspellings. By the way, I hate how they didn't translate the names of characters/enemies/equipment... I've deduced a whole point for that.

Really good and Dark. It should be noted that I play more video games than I do board games but I definitely do both. This game is not quite everything I thought I wanted in a DS board game, but has since made me realized that it's fun on its own. Being a fan of Dungeons and Dragon's, I've never really had a problem with 'house ruling' things to get over minor issues that may bother certain players. Example: the grind in this game is tedious for some people... I don't mind it, but if we want to think up a unique, appropriate way of dealing with it to accommodate time and patience, fine by me and I dont know if I should really hold it against the game. 

PROS: The loot, the dangerous feeling of early game play, the miniatures, the reward of finding the loot you want and organizing a new strategy (so, now our Knight is kind of a caster and our Herald doesn't even carry a weapon... Hmm). Oh, and most of all, THE BOSS Fights! 

NEUTRAL: Beta feel where we Houserule fixes, the grind

Cons: the rulebook (this is not a huge deal especially once you've played twice. Once you have a seasoned player, any newbies will be sped up really fast ride along, it's not actually that complicated)

Overall: 9/10 - this game is addictive as long as you have patience. This game (like DS the video game) has a longer wait than many games for 'the payoff.' that's not to say that your first encounters aren't fun, it's just that the first couple of pieces of 'oh shit, now I'm badass' gear comes a while later sometimes, so go in knowing: 

1.That this game is about perseverence
2.Houserules are not just okay, they can be fun!

Given all the complaints that I had heard, I was a bit nervous going into the first game.  Gotta say, I loved it!  Would recomend this to any fan of the DS franchise.  It is a long playing game, but it is a lot of fun! The boss fights is where it really shines.

I own the core game and pre-ordered the expansion packs separately. The core game has great miniatures and it looks amazing. They could've added more tiles, it becomes a bit too repetitive after playing many games. The grinding is hardcore and time consuming. Difficult game especially if you are playing with players who never played difficult games like this. Overall, good game, and I know the expansions (once are out) will make this game even better

After revisiting this game, I do think it is pretty solid. A bit too long, but I do enjoy it. It may be a biased opinion as I am a huge DS fan. Cannot wait for the expansions.

RATING: 8
Kickstarter supporter here, and glad I took the plunge.  Unlike other dice chucking games, Dark Souls doesn't rely strictly on lucky rolls to get by.  Player and enemy interaction play a much larger role here, utilizing mini pushing, dodging, and staging of figs for best results.  And the main boss bottles are reminiscent of Kingdom Death: Monster skirmishes, albeit more streamlined, but just as intense thanks to the well thought out AI deck.  

Unfortunately, like many, I found treasure rewards a bit tedious, with most of my pulls unusable.  This was easily fixed by Dan Buc's rule located here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1774390/house-rule-tiered-treasure-decks

With this in place game play was a lot smoother, with usable rewards popping up more regularly while not taking out all of the grind of the game (which is, to be honest, heart-and-soul of the Dark Soul's franchise).  Balancing soul usage between treasure pulls and upgrades/leveling up still makes a huge difference, so think carefully before spending your souls.  

This is one of the more enjoyable board games I've played solo in recent months.  Running two characters, I've come close to dying many times, experienced my fair share of death, and have come out on top with the feeling of really accomplishing something.  I'm already looking forward to receiving the expansions later this year.

If you're the type of player who leaves games in progress on the table for days at a time, playing whenever you have a spare moment, and aren't adverse to risk/reward scenarios on the off-chance of victory, then have a look at Dark Souls.

Rated after intial play (solo with 2 characters). Will update after more plays.

First impression:
I have recieved the game yesterday and couldn't wait and played it solo with 2 characters (knight+herald) against Winged knight and had a blast. Rules were clear (with just one or two exceptions), game looks great (Gargoyle mini is just awesome), it feels like Dark Souls while still being fun to play as a tabletop game (lacking the world exploration and gergeous sceneries of the video game but that was expected). Grinding was not much a problem and for solo play there are no downtimes at all. I am sure in 2 player game it will not be problem either. In more players we will see (and that is one thing I am a bit worried of). Aside of that almost complete satisfaction (may be because my expectations were low after some negative reviews and all those misinformation regarding the shipping proces etc.). At the moment I would rate it 8/10 but this might change (and probably will) after more plays.

Well, the game looks nice and I do like the video games quite a bit. Though maybe I'm a bit biased against it since this isn't really my kind of game. But from what I played of it (one 'boss' fight with no spells) the game is way too simple. It's just a combination of a lot of dice rolling and a small memory element. There's really not much strategy or tactics to the game, it's just rolling a lot of dice and hoping to see big numbers. Maybe some push your luck. Though that said I did get into it and enjoy myself a bit so it's not a bad game. I think it does what it does well, but what it does is just kind of lame.

We made one minor tweak to the rules. Multiply the experience based on the encounter level (2 per player for 1, 4, per player for 2, 8 per play for 3). This made the game much more fun and less grindy :)

My 9 year old and I have been having a blast with it. The rules are simple yet engaging for us both.

Note after completion: The later campaign became a huge grind. Neither of us had much fun after that.

RATING: 8
The good:
Gameplay feels like a Dark souls game. The enemy spawns are randomized at the start but once you have reveled them they don't change which gives you the upper hand on subsequent runthroughs.
The boss fights play out really well and the heat up cards are like the phase changes from the game series and mix things up a bit. Probably the best part of the game.
The large miniatures are great, smaller miniatures are not as detailed in some spots but are still good quality.
Components are great for the most part, sturdy cards, nice thick cardboard tiles.

The bad:
Play time. The game is a bit "grindey" requiring you to clear out a zone at least 2 times to earn enough souls to level up and purchase better gear so it can take a while to do and feels like churn. Expect your first play through to take 2x as long as the box time if you choose to go through both the mini boss and boss.
Equipment is randomized drops that can be purchased for souls, sometimes you get something you can easily use. Other times you get duds.
Both of these points tie into the souls required to do things. In the regular games you need (2,4,8) to level up a stat and 1 soul to purchase a random piece of equipment. In 2+ player games you start with no souls and earn 2 souls per player per encounter. It might be a while before you can gear everyone up especially with higher player counts.
Downtime for 3-4 player game. If you're playing with people for the first time it can be a while before your turn comes back to you. This is due to ALL enemies activating before each player activates. It's not really a negative but it is easier if the other player handles enemy movement for you and just gives you the options so the turns go a bit quicker.

Game seems okay out of the box, once you play a couple of games things speed up a good amount, especially enemy activations. I didn't run into any times where the dice rolling was particularly swingy. The length of the game can be adjusted just by increasing souls dropped per encounter if you don't want to sit through the grind or you can split up the mini boss and boss fights into separate sessions if you feel it will drag on too long. Did a good job of representing the souls series overall (minus the grind as it's more of a skill based game whereas here it's like a randomized puzzle with some dice randomness thrown in).

Playing solo felt best with 2 players being quite close. Feels like at 3-4 players the game will definitely drag if the other players are not familiar with the game.

This game is awsome !!
I think it keeps the spirit of the videgame very well.
Productionquality is gorgeous.
Some people doesnt like the randomness of the equipmentpile , but i like it because it
prevent you to skill your character always the same way.
And if the game is to long just half the sparks and double the xp and it doesent change the gamefeeling , you only have a shorter time , wich is needed if all the add ons where delivered.
All in all im happy that i buyed this game it is really fun , and im exited to pledge resident evil to . :)

2017-08-20 - I've only played one time, but everyone I played with really enjoyed this game. I was looking forward to how you can learn the AI deck for a given boss, but that didn't actually play as much of a role as I would have liked. Luckily, the rest of the game was still very fun, if a bit less innovative. If you enjoy coop dungeon crawlers, I think there's a good chance you'll enjoy this one, too.

Played a demo at Essen. So far it seems luck plays a big factor because there is frequent dice rolling (esp. for dodging). However, the game is not mindless bashing, since attacking the boss recklessly will not work. It appears that tactically jumping in and striking is the key to winning the game (just like the real game).

Mi sono giurato che non avrei mai e poi mai dato una valutazione pari ad 1 in un gioco...mai e poi mai...
Questo titolo oltre che ad essere la più grande inchiappettata della storia di kickstarter e non solo, è il fallimento del creare un gioco con il cuore...la staemforged di cacca si è permessa di far uscire un gioco che non è stato assolutamente playtestato se non da degli incompetenti...le miniature sono bellissime ma il gioco non ha struttura, il gioco è basato sulla frustrazione del farming e non ha senso,il sistema che doveva essere come il videogioco LO E' ma il punto è proprio questo.....è un cavolo di gioco da tavolo....BRUTTO BRUTTO BRUTTO e voi della steamforged non meritate nulla....avete puntato al marchio fregandovene del gusto di noi acquirenti per fare soldoni ma adesso vi si ritorcerà tutto contro è perchè ora il mondo parla male di voi....è questione di tempo VERGOGNA
Siamo tutti costretti ad usare regole casalinghe per salvare un po i soldi spesi in questo disgustoso fallimento e per immergerci nel mondo DS che noi amiamo VERGONA ANCORA,,,

Io inoltre sono tra quelli (ialiani e spagnoli) che adesso come adesso hanno ricevuto le copie in ritardo di mesi e con le carte sbagliate che arriveranno chissà quando insieme ai goal sbloccati....fate veramente pena....

Tornando al gioco, il mio voto è 1 e sono dispiaciuto...molto dispiaciuto.

Tried out the solo rules and with one other person, and the game, as written, is just a slog to get through. There were multiple aspects we house ruled even as we were playing that improved gameplay. The result makes me think that there will eventually be a 2.0 set of rules released, as many people I've read about have done the same thing.

It's Dark Souls so ya gotta git gud! 

Yes, it's grindy and tough but I keep going back and it keeps getting better. 

Not only is this game fun and rewarding as is, I'm sure it will be even better once the expansions are released. 

A very solid solo experience as well. If you're fortunate enough to have the space to leave it out then it's easy to pick up and put down. 

Components are not overkilled either so as long as you're organized it's easier than similar games to set up and pack up. 

Only thing it could use a little more attention to are some of the rule descriptions in the rule book which should also include some variant rules.

My teenager actually requested this game, so after some discussion we bought it as a summer activity.  The reviews are all over the place, either loving it or hating it.  He loves it and has played it at least 4 times this week (solo, with friends, and with us).  My husband and I are more moderate.  We don't hate it, it's actually better than I anticipated, we'll play it anytime he asks, but it's not one that we'd seek out on our own.

RATING: 3
Probably the most overhyped and overrated game of the year. Slick dashboard, inventory and leveling system, sure. No scaling. Encounters for a party of 4 and a party of 1 are identical. For each missing player, the party just gets the option of trying to kill the same monster again, potentially gaining more souls (XP) than a full party would.

Where it really falls flat is the terrible board layout/movement system, which is billed as dynamic and whatnot but is anything but. The innovative layout is the equivalent of about a 4x4 square board, just less convenient, uglier and messier in practice. Not much maneuvering to be done on a 4x4 board. In regular encounters, the height of maneuvering is spending 1-2 extra stamina to reach an archer hunkering in a far corner. That's literally all it takes to cross a whole tile, and encounters are restricted to a single tile. It gets even more ridiculous as the game heavily emphasizes knock-back mechanics when the size of the tiles makes knock-back completely pointless.

Boss fights are a bit more interesting with two whole tiles of space available and facing arcs mattering, but the oversized models just emphasize how ridiculous the "nodal" movement is, with boss bases practically touching adjacent nodes, overlapping outside walls and players having to stand on the boss base itself if they don't want to fall off the map. 

Hot garbage.

This game is HARD, so don't go into it with any illusions. We've implemented some house rules (below), and it's STILL incredibly difficult (we haven't even beaten a mini-boss yet, but that's partially because we've been with groups who were not into the game and not interested in the necessary grinding):

- Resting at the bonfire after you've cleared all the rooms leading up to the boss does not cost you a spark
- (Proposed, haven't tried this yet) You can sell back 2 equipment cards for 1 soul

You'll definitely enjoy this game more if you've played the Dark Souls video games and understand the core mechanics (grinding is essential!) The rulebook is pretty bad too: There's no index, the organization is not intuitive, and there are a few places where the directions should be much clearer (like specifying that you use the Dodge dice when rolling your dodge roll; the only place the Dodge dice are mentioned by name is in the opening "Contents" section of the rules, so if you miss that that's what the green dice are, you'll be like us and roll the wrong dice for your first couple games). Also, there are a few things on the character boards that could have been laid out better, and NOWHERE on the character boards is there a symbol that corresponds to the symbol on the back of the individual class starter equipment cards, this is more information that you'll only see in the "Contents" section :/

And also, setup and cleanup are quite long. Normally I'm not super opposed to this (I have no issues with setting up Dead of Winter, for example), but with how long the game is going to take already it's just a pain to sort through the treasure deck, hand out all the tokens locate all your boss cards, etc. Once you get to playing the game is fun, but it can turn into a slog really fast.

The game is so-so, as some of the rules don't jive well with the expectations of any fan of the game series. The art is great and true to the games, however. The combat system is enjoyable and well done. However, the rulebook is very sloppy and I feel that some of the rules just make the game TOO punishing. 

My biggest gripe is a strange one: the assassin character is kind of a dual class between a thief type and a sorcerer. I don't know why but this really bugs the shit out of me. A lot of gear is shared between the other classes, especially the knight and warrior, which makes sense. However, the intelligence based magic items are pretty much only usable by the assassin. If a good one is drawn early and the assassin specs that way, the dexterity weapons are all wasted. The magic ones are all that much better that there is no point to dual spec or begin investing further into dexterity. Unless of course an armor draw demands higher dex; in which case you would still want to be using the magic items and spells as they have range.

A close second for my issues with this game is the balancing. It is pretty much mandatory to play with all four characters unless house rules are being used. So many of the earned souls are being used to shop through the loot deck that it is extremely difficult for less characters to gear up. They should have taken the 16 starting souls for one player and scaled that downward to each character with 0 at all four. 

Along the same lines, there is just way too much time spent going through the ridiculously huge loot deck. And in order to do that, the encounters have to cleared over and over. The easier ones that you have already 'solved' are just wasting time since the solution can be repeated.

The calculation for boss souls is kind of dumb, too. It makes more sense to use all sparks and farm out the encounters before the boss for maximum souls as opposed to saving sparks for a higher souls reward from the boss. Of course this is different in a campaign.

Anyway, the combat is great and it is a challenging and fun game with unique boss fights. Just has some issues. Overall the biggest issues are with how the loot deck is balanced, and with the normal game rules vs. campaign. I think it may be more balanced for campaign play.

Dark Souls is not a great game but it's not a bad game either. The problem is that everything it does is done better in other games. So is it good enough? I'm not sure.
The boss fights are a blast at best and you'll definitely have fun moments with the game but for me the time spent to get into those moments isn't worth when I can play a game that offers more consistent and fun experience.

Thinking about the overall execution of the Kickstarter campaign and the end result, this most probably was the last Steamforged Games Kickstarter I'll support and I'm not looking forward of their future releases.

As a board game, it's OK. As a Dark Souls game, it's lacking.

The randomness factor is high. Lots of dice rolling, but very little to do besides "Move one, roll dice". New equipment just gives more dice to roll. The game feels dated and lacking in polish.

The miniatures are amazing and boss battles are great.

I played the copy of a friend because I am still waiting for my English copy. The rule book needs a good overhaul. The grinding effect that defines the video game works very badly in a board game. The designer should have concentrate on making a good board game and not on to translate the video game into a board game at any costs, meaning detrimental to a satisfying game flow. The production value is high nevertheless. Therefore two stars instead of just one.

I have now played the core game three times with the full table, and once solo.  I got the rules correct only on my most recent playthrough.

This tells me that the rules are somewhat poorly laid out.  Sometimes it is hard to find a specific rule as it is placed in an odd section.  The rules would really benefit to from an index.

That said, the game is fun, as long as you know the Dark Souls lore.  The first playthrough I did I knew nothing about Dark Souls except it was a notoriously difficult video game.  After reading up and watching videos on the lore, I am able to get myself and my companions more immersed in the game. There is a grinding aspect to it, but we liked the opportunity to approach rooms differently each time.

To play a full round with mini boss and boss takes about 5 hours.  However, with some quick notes this can easily be done over two play sessions.

The quality of the miniatures is top notch.  They are gorgeous sculpts that I have really enjoyed painting.

Overall our group has had a good experience with this one.  We will likely continue to play it whenever we want a good dungeon crawler.

I died at the 21th battle including the mini boss fight, that is 7 continuous hours of long and exhaustive battles, due to a roll of 4 blanks while trying to dodge a Sentinel. That is the life of my dual wield Assassin, being able to kill two Silver Knights in one go regularly, but against a Sentinel all it needed to end his run is one good hit.

I had to end the game despite I still have 2 Sparks because I have work tomorrow, but I can't wait to go for my second run.

Will always enjoy playing.

►Remarks:
Gameplay is tedious, grindy, and clunky.
First 30min= actual gameplay, you figure out the optimal strategy to clear non-boss rooms.
1+ hours= where you grind, doing exactly the same things over and over.
Last 30min= boss fight, might be interesting.
During the whole time you hope to get nice cards and to not be screwed by dices.

Random thoughts based on early reviews/rules etc...

1. [b]great idea to link stamina + damage[/b]; but why you can't upgrade that track, too? I don't care a tier 1 in streght, I want more stamina to dodge & attack - but I cant...

2. [b]too much control over enemy movement[/b]; quite gamey, thanks to "node limit" rules plus pushing, and some wording re. "move farther from the target"...

3. [b]miniboss soul reward based on bonfire sparks[/b]; ...what?!

4. [b]minions & grinding[/b]; it's a pity to hear that the core of DS - exploring, facing minions - could be a dull affair; no grinding is required for the actual videogame of course; maybe it's possible to [i]dash-through[/i] encounter tiles even in scenario mode, just say that if at least half characters in the party reach an exit, you quit the actual encounter and stage the next one... just sayin'

5. [b]luck token[/b] makes my teeth gnashing. Please no. Rather spend +1 stamina to reroll 1 die?

6. [b]turn sequence[/b], I go-they go; I understand gameplay balance and everything, just wondering, in this kind of games maybe simultaneous movement could be a better choice. It works from [thing=237][/thing] to [thing=1044][/thing]. And both games are wildly tense and engaging. Just think about timing in Dark Souls... parry & riposte, backstabbing, dodging, all done with a si-move engine...

7. [b]souls risking[/b]; what if we clear the encounters, gain souls a.k.a. cash, then rush back to the bonfire, spend them all, and proceed to the next tile? 

8. [b]but you haven't played it yet![/b] - I haven't experienced muscarinic mycotoxin poisoning neither, yet I have a sound opinion about it, thank you. 

Of course I'll try to play it, or at least make another p&p, but I'm not eager to.

9. [b]what happened to Dancer's model!?[/b]; also, check [url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15382634/dark-souls-the-board-game-review]this review[/url] talking about the quality of the models (droopy weapons, bad glueing etc) - let's hope, I mean hope for the backers/buyers - that it's only an isolated incident

10. [b]Overall preliminary feelings[/b]: an average game, with some nice bits, and a watered-down-stripped-to-the-bare-bones Dark Souls experience. I foresee fan-made homerules and moneymilking miniatures. I [i]also[/i] foresee somebody sayin', "I told you..."

...hands up.

Very obvious they did not play test this game very much. Good components, but the game plays so poorly that they don’t really make up for it. The box blatantly lies about the playtime, on the side it says 60-90 minutes, on the front it says 90-120. The actual playtime is more like 180-240. It’s ridiculously long. The stat/random equipment mechanic is terrible and just doesn’t work. This game must be houseruled a lot to make it playable. I am not a fan of that at all, hence my low rating.

The biggest issue with this game is how items/upgrades are handled. That's where I found the most downtime. I think we're supposed to hold onto our souls more, but my group always tries to spend all of them between each room. I also wish there was a less-randomized item progression for each character. The items we were finding were either all high-end, or all geared toward one character. It made the game not fun when you were the character without items and there was no chance of dealing dmg to enemies.

The game has some interesting concepts like the node system and the AI is interesting but the grinding is way too annoying. 

I can be doing a good job clearing rooms but if the treasure I draw is terrible then I just have to keep redoing and using up sparks to run through the rooms again hoping on one of them I'll get something useful enough to get me through a boss battle. 

I can be using the souls to upgrade my stats so buying weapons you can't use or doesn't fit with your character is just really annoying.

With an IP known for amazing art, innovative gameplay and challenging bosses, I was excited to see the translation & having played Guild-ball I had high hopes.  Speaking with the developers I know that post KS there was a lot of retooling of the game and it's mechanics, but what I played feels like just that. In it's attempt to capture the "feel" of the videogame, Steamforge has done players a disservice and rushed out this low polished mess of a game.  The fact that "Grinding" is a serious component of the game and the major contributor to character growth in 2017, catches me as a step in the wrong direction. There are some mechanics that in video and boardgames that don't translate well, and a large part of this game is just that, so let's get to the good part.

Boss battles

Was very excited about this and in the game's defense it's hands down the best part, which makes it even more frustrating that you'll be grinding for hours before you can give it a decent go. The variety of boss moves and your ability to memorize them do speak to the theme of Dark Souls and I wish that was the whole game, but then this would be a review for Kingdom Death which is still IMO the best "Dark Souls Boardgame" out and even has better miniatures.

So if you want a dumbed down, lower quality Kingdom Death with grinding and zero narrative, then get Dark Souls: the Boardgame. I really hope that SteamForge fixes these issues with the planned expansions in coming. and I'll update my review then.

Is this game too long? Probably. Is it really fun? Definitely. I like this game with 2 players. with three or more it starts to get a bit too long between activations based on the order of battle. This is a fantastic solo game, because I couldn't care less about the pace and time requirements when there's not other players present so I can sit and absorb the terror and difficulty. Which is very high. You will die. A lot. I might house rule the deck of items when soloing, because some of the items are pure trash and I get it's video-gamey, but when you spend all your souls and draw nothing but wizard armour it's super lame.

I'm very disappointed in this game-mostly because the things it does well are things it does extremely well, but its failures make the whole thing unapproachable.

The combat in this game rocks (both bosses and minion encounters are great).  There are a lot of really good things to be said about the combat.

But the pacing is just dismal- you are meant to fight the same battles over and over again in order to progress.  The game is practically unplayable without some drastic homebrew fixes.

Check the variants forum for how to make this game playable.

Backed this game on kick starter. Don't really care what the naysayers believe. I am still excited to get my hands on this and give it a go. I have had plenty of fun with games that elitist gamers, have rated equally poorly or worse. These people rating the game with 0 plays need to lay off on both sides. Just because Tom rates this poorly and you watched his review doesn't give you the right to give it a 1. Just jumping right into the controversy because... IDK anti-hype? Same said for fanboys of the video-game who rate 10/10 with no plays and who rush to the defense of their favorite franchise without even playing the game. Everyone needs to chill until more people get their backer copies.

Lovely models. But the gameplay isn't anything to write home about in any way, shape or form. Lots of dice rolling and crossing fingers.

Could have been so much better.

I can't say enough how much I enjoy this game.  It takes all the creepy and unsettling panic of lurching death from the souls series and translates it to a vaguely chess-like strategic sort of combat sequence.  Very successful in my opinion, but as a souls translation and as a standalone game experience.  Would be a 10 but I feel like the level and item progression is a tad unbalanced as you careen through the campaign mode, it flips very suddenly from super brutal to disappointingly easy.  Still, my bf and I leave the game out on a table and play rooms during meals and between work and gym, etc.

RATING: 9
Dungeon crawler meets wish to die. Good enough a port from the original videogame, but it perhaps relies too much on soul farming. Also, the trading system is somewhat cheesy. That's it for the cons, anything else is great about this game. It gives me the most tense moments I've ever had around a table while fighting minions and bosses alike.

An unfinished game that was rushed to meet a deadline, leading to an unsatisfying experience, extremely easy solo. A grinding lottery of awfully easy to damage soft plastic miniatures that could have been replaced by standees for a more enjoyable component manipulation and way less expensive entry point.

A half-assed effort that will serve to tarnish the IP's reputation, and a shame given the money the game made on Kickstarter. There is enjoyment to be had, but at this price, it sure isn't worth it.

Edit: the more I try to give this turd a chance, the lower I rate it. It says a lot that I get so bored I don't even try to give the boss a shot when I have  sparks left.

Finally got my copy.  i did 2 solo plays. 1 with 1 char and 1 with 2 char.  and Also did a 3 man play through with friends.

Absolutely fun. intense. and difficult.  I died alot in the video games, so nothing different here.  I dont think the manual is as terrbile as alot of people are saying.  Just did a couple reads and after my 2 solo plays and some internet searching the rules are really pretty simple and easy to understand. and movement of bosses becomes 2nd nature.

Definetly applied some house rules once i play with my friends.  I'll get into detail what worked for us in the forums later.

Maybe it's not for everybody, but I love this game.  The game is basically only about combat and leveling up your characters, so if you are looking for more than that, you may be disappointed.  The figure models are very detailed and look great.  The video game mechanics map very well to a board game format.  Like the video game, you have to look as dying as part of the game.  It's not punishment, it's just part of your progression to becoming a tougher hero and taking on tougher enemies.

Here is the trouble, do I rate based on the game as the rule book states or based on the fun the game mechanics have given us with house rules? We really like the game if we fudge a bit to make it quicker and easier. I like the grind, but sometimes I just don't have the time. Instead, I'll level up slightly before the first encounter to get off to a quicker start.

With these small adjustments I really like this game! I can see that it's not for everyone. My wife didn't like it until we got her character a few upgrades - I get that.  Me? I liked it from the first encounter.

If you are looking for a dungeon crawl Descent clone, this isn't it.

Pros:
- a dark fantasy Setting without the usually unavoidable goblins, orks, giant bat's, etc...
- the enemy behaviour system feels fresh and puzzely
- component quality is decent, I especially like that they put a lot of encounter and item cards into the core set
- great expandibility in the future
- overall a tense expirience

Cons:
- some houseruling is hugely recommended to adjust certain weak parts of the rules (treasure System)
- Replaying the same room several times might not be everyones cup of tea
- playtime on the box says 120, a blatant lie. It's a 4 hour game at best
- not the videogame adaptation you are looking for, but maybe a Board game you'll come to like

RATING: 8
I primarily find the game to be quite the enjoyable experience. As far as RPG elements goes, this game doesn't offer too many new things to the table - however, as far as teamwork is involved. The "ALL-OR-NOTHING" mechanic shines bright and is enjoyable and punishing... as the game is intended to be. Thematically, I find the game stays as true as possible to the video game, balance and mechanics in mind. I will now address most of the negative comments.

"Game is grindy/long" This comment is irrelevant and if you feel this way when you play this game then you're probably doing something wrong. Most negative reviews that have this comment come from Eurotrash players who play games that start with NOTHING like engine-building games and have to work up from there. This board game plays like an RPG, so you will kill mobs to get souls to get better gear/level up. IT DOESN'T TAKE FOREVER. You don't HAVE to rest to redo all encounters, you can fight the boss on your first spark if you want to. So ignore grind/long comments.

"The game has no replay-ability" This is false. So freakin' false. EVEN if you play with 4 players (where all possible classes are used), you have 4 classes to choose from. Meaning at minimum to get the full experience you have at least 4 games. Then, you have 2 Bosses and 4 Minibosses which is 8 total combinations. So that comment is idiotic at best.

HOWEVER, I do have qualms against the game that there are valid complaints for. For instance:

Poorly Written Rules: Yes, I agree with this. The rules of this game are solid in the mechanical sense, however this whole rulebook should be re-written and a rules of reference book should be produced to better facilitate flow and easier grab. While this is a deterrent, it's easily overcome after you learn the rules.

Needs more Content: Yes, for the core game despite the replayability math I spoke out there is only a finite amount of plays before you've literally done everything. But many games struggle with this concept. I feel like there should have been at least 3 bosses, and 8 mini-bosses, as well as a way to do PvP.

I don't think the rules are as bad as some people say they are, but they do have problems. Also: The game needs more variety.
I really 'hope', that Steamforged will use the excessive delay they're having with the addons / expansions to work on updated rules. If they merely push out the additional content I really don't see my rating rising higher than maybe 7.3 or 7.4. If they do however work on the rules I really believe the game might have the potential to get close to an 8.
The base box however? I actually feel I'm being generous giving it a 7.0 ... it might as well be 6.7-ish, but maybe I'm still clinging to the (unfortunately wasted) potential that I want to see in the game.

RATING: 6
The game, unfortunately, fails to live up to it's immense, million-dollar hype. In an effort to make a good board game out of an excellent video game, it falls short in similar ways that other video games trying to emulate Dark Souls do: It misses a lot of the finer points that made the video game great, like the subtle narrative, incredible level design, and absolute skill-based gameplay. Dark Souls: The Board Game didn't need to have any of these things to be a good board game, but it also fails to retool these traits for a tabletop system. The game is difficult and grindy, not because of the tactile skill the source material is famous for, but because of newly-introduced dice-rolling and card-draw-based luck mechanics. It lacks any sort of exploration mechanic and has no overhead narrative that isn't informed by the video game series. 

The interesting thing is less that they failed to bring the game to life on the table ( A task that many were skeptical of even during the games enormously successful Kickstarter campaign,) but that the game they did bring to the table just isn't very fun. You can look to Bloodborne: The Card Game, which has a very similar source game, to see how less devotion to the video game formula could have improved the final outcome. Ultimately, the randomness and repetition that made the video game playable as a board game, are the same mechanics that make the game a chore to set up and actually play.

So disappointing.

Love the "Dark Souls" videogames and was genuinely looking forward to this but it fails to capture what "Dark Souls" is about. 

Lifting the enemy-deck idea from "Kingdom Death: Monster" and "Gloomhaven" should have lead to dynamic and tactical combat, but it boils down to little more than rolling dice and hoping for an ideal outcome. Dying in a "Dark Souls" videogame is a learning experience, but dying here is more often than not the result of randomness. Boss battles fair slightly better but everything leading up to the boss is a boring chore. Every enemy receives a turn after each player turn making it very easy to lose to a cheap death with more players.

Though somewhat thematic the Life/Stamina meter is a major annoyance, severely limiting your options specifically in the moments when you need those options.

"Node" movement is dumb. It leads to plenty of confusion that would have been easily alleviated with hex or grid movement.

The amount of grinding required to obtain items that give a slight, SLIGHT, edge to your character is absurd.

Sadly, "Dark Souls" just isn't worth the time or money, especially with so many other great games of the same ilk being released recently.

First off, I think the rulebook and stock rules that come with this game are terrible, hence this game won't be getting a 9+ rating. However...

Once the rules are tweaked (the BGG community are great) so random draw of loot (via tiered treasure decks) and ridiculous game length (playing using half sparks double XP) this game is great fun - tense, with strategic elements and it plays just like the video game in terms of learning how enemies act. I was skeptical about the nodes, specifically the lack of them, but enemies feel different and manipulating movement through the nodes to gain advantage over enemies is satisfying.

It admittedly is a long game, especially if you decide to grind for better gear. However, I've been able to get a group of 4 playing multiple times a week and we all are loving it, even one friend who hates the video game. People talk about repetition, but to be fair that's a lot of what the video game series is. Again, my only complaint personally is that it could be a little more quick paced, and I only really think that because my friend's girlfriend groans and whines and complains every time we pull it out to run a mini campaign. So maybe it's best to play with just 4 people and no extras around. ;) Can't wait to get the expansions and stretch goals, hopefully with new items and rules to fill in some of the gaps it has in its current form.

I recently got the chance to play this with a friend for a few sessions. They stayed really loyal to the dark souls feeling, which is great. Character itemization is fun, since it provides an interesting "puzzle" to figure out how to utilize the items which are flipped over with souls or via chests. Which character to build into the direction of using them and how to combine them after more choises are available.
The character have preferences but you can still build them in interesting ways.

Monster encounters have a lot more than just dice chucking, positioning is essential and figuring out how to move to maximize efficiency and minimize the chance of anyone dying can offer some interesting choises.

Boss fights are really great and learning the boss behaviour is the most important part. With the different attacks bosses perform they become an even greater challange to position properly against them and the decision when to "push your luck" a bit (going for a stronger attack, which leaves you more exhausted and might lead to your death - spending stamina reduces the health you have available).

The biggest problem of the game is its lenght. I understand why they designed it so that you have to go over envounters multiple times - to give the dark souls feeling of farming them, but I think they might have overdone it a bit... Luckily the game allows for an easy "save point" in the middle of the game after defeating the mini boss (since only character stats and available items have to be remembered at that point), to allow to split the mission into two parts (but even half of ti is still really long...)

Another issue is the rather bad rulebook, we had to look up a lot of details online and had to confirm some suspicions we couldn't 100% figure out from the rules alone

Takes a lot longer than it says on the box, around 5 hours. It was a very slow grind, and heavily luck-based, so not at all what I would have expected based on the video game. Much of the interesting decisions-making is in how you build up your characters, since the combat mostly comes down to dice rolls. The rulebook is terrible. When we read the section on boss movement, the 4 of us had 4 different interpretations of how it should work. No index, no glossary, no reference sheets that explain the symbols.

Dungeon crawlers have become interesting.  For me, it started while playing d and d with miniatures on graph paper, then TSR put out a punch dungeon corridors.  Then games trying to represent  the experience of D and D out of the box, assembling  corridors,  GW released many.  Doom board game came along and of course, Descent.    Variations have been many, especially due to the rise in popularity in Kickstarter. 
This game is novel in that it almost tries to mirror what is typical in many video games...grinding. It also succeeds in developing programming individual A.I. for the boss battles, by having a sequence of cards to be drawn revealing their behavior.  A+ for miniatures, so pretty and strange, and are to scale for many games out there.  A+ for quality of cardboard stock for characters etc.  This is  a tactical game, so no narrative campaign, random draw scenarios on a variation of 14 different "arcade showdown" style settings.

I so wanted to like this (I am a Dark Souls nut), but it's under-designed, under-playtested, overly-long (in a massive way) and sadly, very rarely much fun. 

Steamforged demoed their boss fights - which are ok - but literally everything else they added into this game on the road to getting it out to KS backers is ill thought-through and unsatisfying.

There is a bunch of people extolling the virtues of this game but I honestly cannot see what it has going for it. It requires a significant investment of time (5+ hours, and that's a conservative estimate), and there are just so many better experiences out there you could be enjoying. 

Avoid.

3. Tense battles boss or other wise

Things it does wrong:
1. All encounters offer same rewards
2. Nothing to do with useless loot; need to break away from the videogame for this one Steamforged. It is still a board game.
3. All tiles might as well been the same; the differences are barely noticeable
4. low variety in enemy types

Review is based on quality of what I have received, with an added bonus for quality of assistance I have received from their customer support team... Coincidentally, I haven't received either, so the lowest possible score applies.

Steamforged has selected a shipper who literally LOST my product, they refuse to assist until the shipping company does something that is against the shipping company's own policy, which means they refuse to help and are effectively flipping me the bird. Never again Steamforged, never again.

Like most people I imagine, I kickstarted this as a big fan of the Dark Souls series. The end result is good, but it falls short of what I hoped it to be.

I have played this a few times now (once solo, and the rest of the time with a friend) and we keep running into the same problem of pacing and often needing to restart.

The treasure deck is so large, it means that if you don't get some treasure you can equip after the first couple of encounter resets, you might as well restart, because you will not have enough sparks to beat the boss. You can get round this by just ignoring the spark limits and keep going until you succeed (just like the video game), but that can make the game drag on. The other option would be to reduce the treasure deck size to enable a more consistent gear drop.

Constantly restarting the encounters can also get frustrating. This is a weird one, in the video game I have no problem with this, but as a boardgame it feels like just resetting your progress over and over, and the headway I feel I was making was very small.

My first attempt took me well over 5 hours, and most of that was spent redoing the same encounters. It did start to drag. Tweaking the rules as I stated above allowed me and my friend to get more enjoyment out of it, but it definitely a game that can drag on.

The quality of the pieces was also not as good as I was hoping. The smaller miniatures get damaged very easily (especially the swords), but my big gripe was the dice. Maybe I just had a bad batch, but my dice were so bad you could almost predict the rolls, they were so badly weighted. I ended up using some other custom dice in place of the official ones to try and balance out the dice rolls.

There is a lot to like here - the larger boss figures look very cool, and I am interested to see how the expansions add some mechanics and items. The inclusion of some scenario modes in the rules also give a good basis for D&D like adventures over several play sessions. We did try this out, and found ourselves having a lot of fun roleplaying and setting the scene.

I think in trying to be loyal to the premises and mechanics of the videogame, Steamforged forgot about the tweaking required to translate it over to boardgame. Progress can be slow, and it often seems to come down a bit too much to luck with your treasure draws. It's not terrible, but this will probably not remain a mainstay of gaming sessions.

Dungeon crawlers - especially ones with campaigns - are completely my thing. I enjoyed this game. This is a pretty decent play, even if it did start feeling repetitive a bit more quickly than I'd have liked.

Play Gloomhaven instead - it delivers far better on a similar experience. I'm not sure this'll ever come off the shelf again, which is sad, because the minis are pretty cool.

For a solo game this is not fun. It's just a bunch of rolling dice. As a group for lets say 3 players. It's really fun. Try to figure out the best strategy on each tile. 

If it was a little bit easy on solo this will go higher but a solid 7 is the way to go.

Played it with a buddy who backed the Kickstarter. We were definitely wrong on a handful of our rules but we're slowly getting it. I've since played it a bit on TTS and plan on getting it once it gets its actual release. 

Rules are a bit confusing at first, especially if you may or may not be new to dice rpg games. I've only started my time-sink into tabletops recently and started with mostly card games and have begun into dice rpgs the past couple of weeks. 

From the amount that I've played so far, this game is very challenging. It brings a lot of predictability to the table when you're facing regular encounters and a lot of unpredictability when you're facing bosses. How you handle who has threat and how to control the enemies is a very fun and strategic part of the game. It somehow does a brilliant job at capturing the mechanics that make a Dark Souls game feel like Dark Souls, so if you loved those games, this is going to be fantastic.

Definitely worth the play but don't expect to sit down and have it learned and played-through in the 120 minute play time that BGG says. :D

The vanilla rules are somewhat imbalanced and you can feel that there was not enough  time to make a great game with great rules. however, it has the dark souls feel to it and if you use custom rules provided by the community (or just your own house rules) the game really shines. 
tl;dr great game material, horrible rules/balancing --> use your own!

I originally gave this game one star because it arrived without an entire deck of cards. It took about two months, but Steamforged eventually sent along a replacement. I think the game itself is good enough. The physical presentation is pretty excellent: the miniatures are great, the rulebook is made from a gorgeous matt stock, the tiles feel nice and solid, the packaging is quite neat. Overall, a great physical product.

I agree with other reviewers that the combat can be a bit grindy, but this is easily fixed with some simple house rules and the encounters themselves often make for some interesting puzzles. The boss fights are tense, and make for a nice climax to the game.

Demoed this game at GenCon and absolutely loved it !!!  The combat was fun and had that Souls feeling.  I was getting sweaty palms when we started getting the Dancer low on HP.  We ended up beating the Dancer with a lot of team work.  Make sure you are paying attention to the boss cards for the first half of the round so you know the attack patterns so you can save your flask for later and keep your HP up.  Once you get the boss to a certain HP mark you hit a heat up and they get special attack cards.  When those cards are drawn the deck shuffles again and continues to do so every time that card is drawn.  I absolutely can't wait until I can get my hands on my KS copy of the game.  Looking forward to playing this with my gaming group and dying over and over again lol.

If you like the videogame you will probably like this. There is some variation game to game as the enemies you face are randomized and a few different bosses you can encounter. Alot of repetition as you will have to fight those enemies multiple times to gather enough souls to level your characters up to be able to equip the really good gear. That being said, it is fun to fight and learn your enemies move sets to be able to blaze through them faster the next time. My only real complaints are the bosses directional abilities are very confusing starting out and the difficulty of this game ramps up A TON the more players you have. By far best when played with 2.

Review Date: May 2017

Disclaimers for context: I have never played the DS video games. I own the kick-starter edition of the board game.

Positives: Production of components, models, boards, players boards are all excellent. The combat mechanics are fantastic. The breadth of variety in treasure and enemies is impressive. It plays very well Solo and with any number of others* (with variants, see below). Value for money, lots of content for cost.

Negatives: The rule-book is poorly written, with misleading and scattered information. The pacing with the standard rules is far too slow and grindy, almost unplayable and certainly not fun enough to justify. 

Conclusion: This game was almost amazing and was let down by a desire to keep so true to the original IP that rewarded and demanded a slow grind. This, whilst appealing to some will not please most who are looking for a 2-3 board game (as it can double that or prove impossible). 

Score: without using the rule variants it would have to be a 5 or 6
Score: Using the rule variants it becomes fantastic and would be an 8 or 9

Note: The house rule variants I use for a 9 review are:

A) Using the starting 16 souls always, not just on the solo variant
B) Awarding 2 souls plus 1 soul per threat level on the cards ie. 3 souls for lvl1, 4 souls for lvl 2 and 5 souls for lvl 3.
C) Market stall with 5 active treasure cards face up available to purchase for 2 souls or purchase one face down as normal for 1 soul
D) Character market includes all character treasure available to purchase for 2 souls each. Basic treasure pre mini boss, advanced treasure post mini boss
E) NO Campfire sparks! You lose you die, gameover. No repeat, no grind. Or cap it at a level the group is happy to play to as it adds significant extra time

Bossfight mechanisms are interesting, but the buildup towards the final bossfight is incredibly boring. Grinding out all XP before the bossfight is even more boring. And that buildup phase is totally not worth the timeinvestment to then have the bossfight.

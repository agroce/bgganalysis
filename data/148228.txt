Raw, unadulterated engine building. Something about this makes me want to play this over Dominion and I think it's because of the chips, not necessarily the game play (as there is at least a planning element for each turn in Dominion, and it uses the random draw, both of which are missing in Splendor, but Splendor takes like half the time). Maybe because it's quicker, or more attractive, dunno.

RATING: 7
This is a great game with a lot of interesting play. I am a little concerned that there are not that many strategies that you can employ to win, but the basic concept is amazing. The person who creates the best combinations wins the game, which is right up my alley!

Update: It's not as fun as the first few playthroughs just because it is a little bland. 

I like to play this on the IOS and listen to the music!

I thought it was very okay when I first played it. The chips are obviously very nice and fun to hold. But a long time later I played it a second time and couldn't wait for the game to be over. I wouldn't refuse if asked, but I'm not really interested in playing it a third time.

RATING: 4
Way overhyped. A dry, non-interactive, mathy game with a pasted-on theme in a way oversized box. Absolutely nothing special here.

If you want to sit in silence for 30 minutes doing math buy this... or any other of the million boardgames that took the same approach.

Everyone loves it though so i get to play it a lot. I'm a good person.

Rated a 3 after my first play. 3p, took nearly an hour, we all went for the same 'mass cards, get nobles' strat and were relieved when the game ended. 

Decided it needed another shot and have put a few hours into Prestige and now the official app. Upgraded to a 6. I think it's too abstract to be a good gateway for most, but as I find myself thinking more about how chips circulate, reserving cards, when/how to go for the higher tier cards right off the bat... I'm finding it a bit more interesting than I previously thought. 

In terms of the physical game I still think I'd keep it to 3p max, I expect it to be a bit too slow and chaotic at 4p.

This game won't get old for me. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is that it feels like a similar game many of the times I play it, but that doesn't make it un-fun. I would just like more options overall; the game is quite simple, and that makes it beautiful, but I would also enjoy some way to maybe pay an opponent to use their gems as well as double-gem cards or point-only cards to add some variety to the gameplay.

A like this game a lot but only if played with players who make quick moves. When they start to think too much the game suddenly becomes much worse.

However I'm a bit afraid that after playing it more (I did only a few times) I will start being boring. Then again I still need to learn to watch others what they aim for.

RATING: 6
A fun game, but by my account it has an essential flaw. The fact that you can "reserve" op to three cards can spoil a game, if say you need primarily the white (diamonds) for the endgame and not many of them show. If you're unlucky the opponent may be able to just reserve the and lock your chances of winning points.

36+ plays / 2,3,4 players.

LIKE: Great engine building, feels like it's stripped to the core, but it works. Great artwork, good depth, fast game.
DISLIKE: Some randomness in the cards that come out. Level 3 cards don't move as much (2 player), so strategy is a little static with those cards. small level of luck involved.
OVERALL: Very fun. A classic. I've seen different strategies prevail: use your reserves to block players, make a rush for the 2 or 3 level cards, Chip hoarding.

RATING: 9
Certainly an approachable incredibly produced game. Game play is very easy to understand: take chips or buy cards (or perhaps reserve a card). But there is a joy derived from buying cards, a tension in wondering if your fellow players will interfere (knowingly? unknowingly?), and a rush when your combination of cards lets you buy the 'expensive' things. It's very brisk - there's a snowball effect at the end which spins everyone headlong inside 40 minutes (or even less). I put it as a very original gateway game - nothing like Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne, but equal in stature and family fun.

First, I was impressed by the quality of the components. Good thick sturdy cards, above average art, and close to casino grade chips.

Next, I fell in love with the quickly explained rules and fast game play.

Soon, I got disappointed with the lack of dramatic arc. You just kept racing against the others without really building your position. It just boiled down to being faster than your opponents. I would've liked to use my wits as well.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

Splendor is the definition of a game with a pasted-on theme.  The game is simple and has decent decision points, but also a fairly high degree of luck.  It's short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome, so it has that going for it.  As a light filler goes, you could do worse.

Having said that, I would not pay the $40 MSRP for this game.  The game has clay chips that are very nice, but there aren't that many (40), and the rest of the game is some cards and a handful of chipboard tiles.  There are quite a few unique illustrations on the cards, which probably contributed to the cost, but not all 90 cards have their own illustration.  I would put this at a $30 value.  On top of that, the box has an excessive amount of unused space (probably to justify the price of the game), making it take up far more room than I would like for a light filler.  It takes up more space on the shelf and in the game bag than it deserves.

I have downgraded this game because it is simply not fun to play with others. It is like group solitaire from a a single set; the only player interaction at all lies in taking something someone else wanted to take, before they do. Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing you can do that affects any other player. Entire games can be and are played in complete silence.

Ever wondered what it'd feel like to be debeers? I am always up for a game of splendor. It is a well designed game involving a little luck but mostly skill. You spend your rounds either acquiring gems or using them to purchase mines that auto produce buying power and sometimes have victory points. You are attempting to obtain enough buying power to purchase enough mines to gain enough victory points to win. If you purchase the right configurations, you also attract nobles worth points and speed along your victory. This game was second place in the spiel to camel up and I believe the first game by space Cowboys. Thankfully not their last.

When I approached Splendor for the first time, it had been the new hotness already for quite a while. So maybe I had too high expectations, but I was not particularly impressed by it... even if I liked it quite a bit.

Splendor is for sure gorgeous looking with its artwork and those nice chunky poker chips. The game-play instead is very straight-forward and it's all about optimization. You have to build an engine and time your actions really well if you want to come out on top. This makes Splendor a very interesting puzzle. My main complaint with the game is that most of your turns are not really that exciting. You just take some poker chips and hope no one else buys the card you want. That's the same problem I have with Ticket to Ride. Spendor however is faster and, especially, more interesting for me as a mental exercise and therefore I like it a lot more than TtR.

I may not have found the mind blowing game everyone was raving about, but I found a pretty good game with some solid concepts and an interesting challenge. It's a very nice game. Just I wouldn't consider purchasing it. I enjoy it but I think I'll be fine using someone else's copy.

This is a typical engine building game, where you have to amass certain number of so called gems in order to buy cards, which in turn provide permanent production of gems, which you will be able to procure even more cards. Some cards, usually which are expensive (lot of gems needed) have score values. And the player who achieves at first 16 points ends the game. It is a straight forward engine building game, fast paced and easy to learn.

This is an amazing game, which while it is very simple, there is a lot of strategy to it. The game doesn't take a long time to play, and most people that I have introduce this to have wanted to play again after we play it.
It is worth noting though, that there is really no theme in this game, so while this is an excellent game, if you are looking for something that is highly thematic, this is probably not going to be what you are looking for.

2nd play: The game feels like it should have more interesting decisions, but the luck factor is very strong. It's enjoyable to play, especially while shooting the breeze with friends, but after 2 plays I think I've explored most of the depth of the game.

I found this game totally dry. Soulless even. Moving poker chips around and getting card from time to time really isn't description of having time of my life. For now, I don't have such low raking for games, but nonetheless I don't expect that [thing=148228][/thing] will get any higher on my list. It was boring and I couldn't be happier when game was finished. There are much better gateway board games available with similar mechanics (drafting, set collection), e.g. [thing=68448][/thing] or [thing=9209][/thing].

RATING: 8.5
Probably my most played game in my collection. So easy to pull out and surprisingly deep.

I entirely do NOT understand complaints of multiplayer solitaire on this game. All player states are completely visible and very easy to parse at a glance.  You can guess opponent strategy fairly seamlessly and move in to block by reserving something they want or see they will beat you to a card and move toward another one.

The only negative on this game is that giving away your strategies can be so damaging to your play that we find ourselves closely guarding our plans, making this a fairly quiet game of people staring at the table and quietly making their moves.  This type of behavior is NOT multiplayer solitaire, quite the reverse, but I can see that this is not what some are looking for in a game.

классные тяжёлые фишки камней с металлическими вставками. красочное оформление (хоть и отдаёт цыганским шиком на мой вкус). сама игра простая, по ощущениям напомнила Ticket to Ride: тоже собираешь цветные сеты, чтобы потом ими расплатиться за карты. карты же сами по себе "производят" (или дают скидку на) один цветной элемент. в итоге ты довольно быстро выстраиваешь свою микроимперию цвета, которая потом сама бесплатно снабжает тебя картами. 

очень много зависит от того, какая карта придёт следующей из стопки на стол. часто бывает, покупаешь что-то не очень оптимальное, на его место приходит суперкласс, и противник разумеется тут же его покупает себе (после чего снова выходит какая-то вялость).

RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this game a lot. Of course ultimately, this game is seriously very light. However several factors keep it from being "good". Number one and foremost is the fact that the game ends at 15 points. It feels way too soon for most of the strategies in the game, as you feel like it's barely half over by that point. Also the component quality is really poor. Really, poker chips for gems when you can buy actual acrylic gem pieces much cheaper? Really guys? And a box that's 4 times larger than the components all assembled together. The game is also very swingy based on what nobles are in play and when certain gems come up. If the deck(s) clump together, it throws off the entire game's balance forever which I see as a fatal flaw. Otherwise the game has a ton of potential and I can be talked into playing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pretty fun.

So far we've only played 2 player, and the ending sometimes feels a little anti-climatic, like "Oh, you're at 15 already? And my last move only takes me to 5? Drat."

But it's fun to plan move based on the current cards and gem piles, and then having them change when your opponent buys a card and the one that shows up is more awesome.

Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops—all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.

I've played this now three or four times and, each time, I find myself simply not caring. Star Realms is just as easy to teach, just as portable, and is basically the same game with a little bit of added flavor and more player interaction. Minus all that, and you're just playing Klondike. I'd gladly play Klondike by myself, but I can't think of any reason to play it in a variant where you have to wait for other people to play a move before you're allowed to play your next move.

I think that my other issue with the game is that I would like it to be an engine building game. I want to create something that's able to churn out gems and power my way through whatever might come. It presents itself like it should be that sort of game. But at the official game length (and, granted, I don't play Star Realms to its official hit point count), winning in Splendor seems to be more of a puzzle rather than a build. It's purely down to looking at the highest valued card on the table when the game starts and finding the shortest path to it.

I like puzzle games. I've exhausted Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection. But those are solitary games. Splendor is also a solitary game, where other players act as a randomizing element to obscure the path to the target. And played solitary, on a cell phone, I might become very good at the puzzle and be able to dominate in live play, but meh.

Star Realms doesn't have that same, definable target, the high card. There is some flavor to the different strategies one can take to defeat his opponent. When you lose, you have to figure out what tricks your opponent pulled, and see if you can pull it off as well, or find a way to defeat it. While subtle, there is some jostling around in there. In Splendor, there is only one real strategy: The shortest path. And once you've gotten good at that, success against your opponents becomes luck of the draw.

RATING: 6.5
Purchased after developing an affection for Jaipur, and on the grounds of it being a minimalist distillation of the engine building style. 

After a single play, I found it a touch lack luster with two. The play experience felt relatively dry. Unlike Jaipur, it doesn't feel like the game space is tight enough for two; the game would have more tension if you were vying over a tighter selection of cards. As it stands now, it is unlikely you'll both value the same card, so play becomes little more than a race to grab to see who can optimize their chosen path quickest. 

Will try it again. Perhaps my provisional rating will increase. 

For what it is worth, my partner enjoyed the experience faaaaar more, and we enjoyed its fast playtime as well. 

Oct. 22nd update: Yes, I raised the score from 5 to 6.5. It is a fun, very thinky game. Sadly, the ending is abrupt and anticlimactic.

I've always enjoyed playing this. First time play and it was an instant hit. I took it home to my wife and taught her and she loved it. Very very fun! We started playing ultimate splendor because it is the two of us. We just go until all the cards are done. Find this pointless though about halfway through because pretty soon it's just picking up cards because the gems are worthless. Never have had a bad game and never will. I wish they would come out with an expansion to add more players. Other than that a perfect game on our shelf.

It's an excellent game. I think it would be a phenomenal travel game if the cards were smaller. It's not a rowdy or really a very interactive game in terms of conversation during the game. However, you have a lot of tough choices and you're constantly engaged on what's happening on the table. There is a good amount of strategy to it and it' a good game with 2, 3, and four players.

An engine builder that I find tolerable because it is both quick and simple.  Player interaction is limited to taking something before your opponent.  The turn of the cards brings a touch more luck than usual in this type of game.

Simple rules, plays fast. 

Its a game about finding and building your engine and watch it give you VP:s. Hopefully your engine is better than the other players.

I like the simplicity of the design and how it´s a such good distilled game, only one mechanic really. This could have been a small part/mechanic of a much larger game. It´s a Euro light. 

I get the same wibe as when I play Love Letter.

Great pieces, particularly the poker chips that are really nice to manipulate ! Splendor is a relatively short game with easy to learn mechanics.

Basically, you can take resources - 3 different ones or two of the same type - or buy a card which'll give you one virtual resource each turn. Doing so,you score victory points and begin to build your engine to buy cards granting more points, as they are more expensive resource-wise to get...

There are also noble guests to invite to your house, those VIPs only granting 3 victory points each. They'll come to visit you if you manage to get a certain number of cards giving you particular resources... Whenever a player reaches 15 points, the other players have one more turn to play. The player with the most victory points total wins the game.

The game is fluid, quick, tensed, but feels really different if you play with 2 or 4 players, the former being less chaotic than the later. I'll never turnaway from a Splendor game.

One of the best games for me. It is simple and fast which makes it perfect for a quick game in a busy day. I played it mostly with 2 players and conversely to many board games which can be played with 2 but they are  best for more players, Splendor works perfectly in two. Different ways to achieve the points (the nobles or the most valuable cards) make the game different every time. Luck is a small component of the game.

This game is a good puzzle. It often escalates extremely quickly and I tend to lose to my wife almost every time as a result. Balancing noble tiles, high-scoring prestige cards, and your humming gem engine is tough! It's a light game, but there is also depth available for typically heavier gamers. At two players it's a very strategic game... while at three and (especially) four players it becomes highly tactical. It's enjoyable regardless!

My favorite aspect is the amazing quality and weight of the gem chips. I want to do a Scrooge McDuck swan dive into a pile of those chips. I want them in every game.

This is not a bad game, but...I am not as enamored with it as others seem to be.  I feel like luck can play quite a bit of a role.  You need personage tiles to win, but snagging the right cards to acquire them can prove to be a tricky endeavor if the right ones come out at the wrong time (i.e. before you even have an opportunity to acquire them).  

This is one of those games where someone else besides the winner was always about to win the game on their next turn.  Unfortunately, that someone else inevitably thinks of at least one instance where they were screwed by the luck of the draw (which, of course, could have made all of the difference).

A nice game that plays quickly and easily and flows nicely with mellow decision-making that nicely focuses your attention on wanting certain cards.  I can see it's appeal and accessibility, and it does have noteworthy art and nice chips.  

On the other hand, it seems to me to be wholly lacking in theme which really diminishes my desire to play it again, and for me, it lacks particularly compelling, interesting or original mechanics.  Bottom line:  there is a pleasing, mellow, short sweetness to Splendor, but it doesn't grab my heart or desire much.

Perhaps a good family game to play with kids. Experienced players won't find anything interesting out of it. The strategy behind the game is very simplistic without much decision making at all.

This is one of the most well thought out games to be produced in some time. Sure, it isn't mind-blowingly complex or thought=provoking. You collect resources via some poker-style chips and use them to purchase cards from a central display. Those cards add to a permanent set of resources you control that aid in purchasing more expensive cards from the central display again. It is simple but brings out a complex game that moves along at a steady pace and never wears out its welcome. This game should win the Spiel award it has been nominated for. We don't think there is another game out there that plays as smooth and as seamlessly as this one but still brings out so much fun.

Thanks, 2015 Secret Santa!

Little to no variety between games hurts this.  You're just grabbing gems, which let you buy cards, which let you buy better cards.

Despite that, it's still fun every time, so I've adjusted upward (May 2016).  I don't think I've lost this game more than once, though, out of all these plays.

This was gifted to me by my best friend. The mechanics are pretty well balance but really depend on the cards revealed. Your strategy is to work towards getting an assortment of the colors and then maximizing gem draws. It's really straight forward and doesn't require to much in depth thinking. It works well in my family and we can lightly pay attention.

People really do tend to hate on Splendor, don't they? I take issue with that. Thanks to a pick up and play design combined with a healthy amount of depth and strategy, Splendor is a solid addition to any gamer's collection.

My only criticisms revolve around numbers. First off, this game needs to support six players. Secondly, the game might play a bit better with a static two gems of each color (including gold) per player.

On the surface it is everything I dislike in a game: abstract, no player interaction, random niche economy tacked on as the theme.  Oh how wrong I was. Somehow it does not feel abstract when you are playing it. I think it has something to do with the beautiful art and quick but satisfying gameplay. Also you get to stack your thick chips in front of you and gloat over your ever-growing gem production. As for player interaction, the game ends up feeling pretty brutal at times, as players start stealing cards and nobles that they knew other players were about to get. I love this game.

Fast, simple, and elegant engine-building game. Accessible for non-gamers and still challenging and interesting enough for gamers. The decisions you make seem easy on the surface, but there's definitely a lot to think about regarding the opportune times to take the limited chips and denying your opponent a card.

The game, however, has very little interaction and feels like everyone is just playing their own game. Theme is non-existent.

Decent entry game for new gamers.  This one is a ramp engine game.  Collect gems to spend on cards that give you more gems and earn victory points.  I would have rated it higher because the game does exactly what it is supposed to but this one is a tad bit too light for me.

I really don't get the hype. With two players this game seriously sucks.
You virtually need no strategy at all to win. Just grab what you can in the bottom line and get a visitor. If you use any other move, you are already at a disadvantage. 
First player won nearlly every game in my two-player experiences. 
You can't win with an alternative strategy, like go for the middle row and take a different approach to gain enough victory points. 
The theme is okay though and the chips have a nice thickness to them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beautiful components, simple rules, straightforward gameplay, some tactics, Splendor is a wonderful introductory/filler game.  Be the first person to accrue 15 victory points by either gaining gems/cards or nobles worth victory points and win the game!  It's also VERY easy to teach, to learn, and to play!  Very little downtime!

Chip collecting and engine-building combine to drive the game forward rapidly -- if everyone knows the rules, it's about 30 minutes per game!

A bit dull with two, Splendor ramps well to three and four players.  Be warned:  there is some luck involved in the game.

Not much to speak of theme-wise.

Swift playing, lovely artwork, solid components. Has more depth and more viable strategies than is apparent after a first play, depending in large part (far more than you'd expect) on the specific mix of nobles for the game. Very tactical, with an interesting balance point which determines the relative importance of buying cards for your engine, versus buying cards purely for points.

In the end, the game doesn't really excite, though, and I've grown pretty weary of it. There's just not enough of a _game_ there.

Splendor is a very engaging, very quick, economic-engine game that provides a moderate amount of brain-burn. It's a game that I really enjoy playing and something that has received nothing but positive remarks from other gamers. That being said, the speed/engaging-feel might be making the game feel more deep than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, your decisions matter in this game and you need to focus on the board and other players. But after 9-plays, I'm starting to feel how the random elements can impact the game.

But being such a quick game, it is essentially a filler... and has a remarkable number of meaningful decisions for that. Component quality is amazing but I am actually starting to dislike the heavy-weight poker chips; if you carry your game around, they tend to fly everywhere. Perhaps lighter wooden chips would have been a better decision.

A drafting game with very simple rules, and some challenge. Sadly, it gets old very quickly, and there's a huge luck factor hidden in the way the cards get drawn, and when they get drawn. A decent game I might play once in a while, but far from a game I'd like to play constantly.

Great engine builder. You can play as an opportunist and grab or reserve all high value cards early on or build up your grand empire and grab the nobels before your opponent.

Such a good design, immediately hit home with us.

The number of players greatly impacts the game's feel. Two players can be a little limited, as we rarely touch the upper tier of cards, but because you are hyper-aware of what your opponent is doing, it is also intensely competitive. With four players, play feels more wide-ranging and open, as the winner frequently reaches 15 unexpectedly (with the help of nobles).

An excellent game, the first I've played where you take the role of a master jeweller. It's a familiar Dominion-esque setup, which is made unique by the finite resources available to the players at any one time, in the form of jewel tokens. These are of a high quality by the way, resembling properly weighted poker chips, and the cards are sturdy and glossy.

A good price makes this very difficult to not recommend to anyone and everyone.

Really simple idea, but works quite well.  The mechanics are extremely easy to explain and to play.  Don't look for any kind of hidden strategy, this is kind of opportunistic game in form of a race to collect the jewels, and of course the characters.
Cards are nice, and chips are good quality, but to me a bit out of place.  The chips are kind of poker type, and to me they look a bit strange when playing, but this is totally personal.  I have played with big plastic gems instead of the chips, and it looks definitely better (well done, Jokin!).
Insert is well designed, but in an enormous box for what it has inside.

Quickly became one of my all time favorites. Bought it on a whim of suggestion from my FLGS employee when looking for a game that could pack light on a camping trip. I just ditch the box and throw all the pieces in the bag that comes with Hive and I'm good to go!

Splendor is the gamer's idea of a filler: it is quick, abstract but filled with some meaningful decisions.
It is a set collection game, with some indirect confrontation: players can reserve a card if they see you're going to take it, and hinder your progression.
There is some luck involved, as new cards turned could benefit the next player, but it's definitely tolerable in such a fast paced game.
Final mention goes to components: cards are sturdy and beautifully illustrated, chips are wonderfully weighty, and the box has a great insert to keep everything finely organized.
Could've won the SdJ, but barely missed it!

Why'd I sleep on this game. Almost a perfect information game. I played a couple games and can't stop thinking about it. There's not much to it. Cards and poker chips. Rating may drop over time but right now it's a ten. Fun factor alone is a ten to me. The card quality in my game was lacking a little.

I've played through a couple of times with my daughter, and we have quite a bit of fun with it. I think adding more players would add a lot more twists and turns to it. More people vying for the same cards and whatnot. It's a pretty straight forward game and doesn't take long to pick up on. It's a fun easy quick game. I'd never call it a favorite or anything, but for a light quick game, it can't be beat.

Definitely one of the best games I've played!  It's quick, has a terrific balance of luck and strategy, and is so easy to learn that you'll want to play again as soon as you finish.  The limited number of available gems coupled with options to speculate on cards that haven't been revealed yet mean the game will never become boring!  This game has become an instant favorite among our friends, even those who don't typically play board games!

7: After buying it and enjoying it with my children- who did the gems and the mines. Not so abstract anymore.

The game could be rated higher if it had an advanced level that either had tricker cards or bidding. I think it is as good as the Agricola family game at this point. I recommend playing with the mat, it gives it flair.

Splendor had been off my radar for some time, as it didn't seem to offer anything of interest to me personally. After playing, I can see the appeal.

The resource system feels a bit like Magic's mana system, which makes you feel smart for proper sequencing. The economic snowball makes you feel like you are continually improving, even if other players are improving more efficiently. The character tiles give you a long-term goal to pursue, which provides an ever-so-subtle element of coopetition in the early-to-mid game.

That said, the decisions were not interesting enough for me to want to play again. If I did, I sense that it would be best with exactly 3 players.

Splendor works for everyone, from children to parents to serious Eurogamers to non-gamers. Simple mechanics that build logically to a satisfying conclusion.

I don't like Splendor. It is only a game where you change chips into cards and with these cards you get a discount on the next cards you buy. With bad luck somebody else takes the card that you want so you have to decide which card you wanna get instead.

Not my kind of game!

This game seems to receive some hate from certain gamers. Strangely, I've noticed anything that gets some mainstream love seems to get dogged. Anyway, I know the theme is pasted on and some have complained that it is undeserving of its awards, but this game is just fun. It's abstract enough for non-gamers, parents, etc. Quick to learn. It's easy to setup and does what it does very well. It can be played several times in one night. This is a favorite of my wife's. So, that helps to get it to the table repeatedly. I also enjoy the engine building.

I have enjoyed Splendor. It is an incredibly easy going game that has worked well to teach to new gamers.

There is a great solitaire variant in the Forums.

Really neat resource management game that plays like a more advanced version of the two-player classic "Jaipur."

A solid game, a better designed game there has never been.  It really boils down the essence of quite a few other engine/take-that games into a really good little package.

That said, there are three itches this scratches:
1) Getting stuff that wins you the game
2) Screwing-over someone else who wants your stuff
3) Building some semblance of an engine

And I found myself thinking that Cargo Noir was actually pretty good at 1 & 2, and I feel like there's a huge thrill-fest in engine building that makes this either better or worse depending on your situation. 

I'm not much for being an engine guy, but over repeated plays, engine stuff is where it's at.

For all the design, and everything that's good about it...  still kind of 'meh' on all of it.   No 'wow' factor in it for me other than this - It would definitely be the first thing I reached for in the more advanced games.  Not that it's more advanced, but a lot of the theory is expanded in advanced games.  If you love the engine building stuff....hooo boy are there a lot of games to see.  If you hate the engine building stuff....well, lots of options.

On an aside, the iOS app...  go for bonus tiles every time, and you'll do no worse than 2nd place.

At first, it feels like just some simple set collection game with Luck being the major factor to win the game. But after the second game, third game, and so on, I realized that it's definitely not luck. You need a good strategy, hand management, pay attention to your enemies' step and cover your own to win the game. And the more I play, the more I'm excited about this game. 

The first 2 or 3 games, we played splendor in silence. But as we keep playing, it's getting noisier as each of us trying to redirect and distract our own movement by pointing other player's movement possibilities, especially when they're approaching 15 pts. 

When that happened, we usually try to convince other players into joining our cause and collectively taking steps to hinder the winning player's step (and silently delivering our own steps to victory).

I don't get why this is so popular. It does nothing for me. To me it's a basic set collection game which rewards simple efficient play.

RATING: 8
What's the theme meant to be in this one? You buy jewels, and then showing those jewels when you buy more jewels gets you a discount? I don't get it, but the card art is very nice, the heavy poker-style chips are lovely to handle, and the gameplay is wonderfully simple but agonising. It's a racing game, essentially, which starts slow and builds to an exciting crescendo as people start cashing in massive amounts of jewels to secure big points at the very end. Lots of fun across the whole spectrum of player counts as well. Hate the size of the box though.

Poorly balanced and not developed.

Could be interesting with better numbers/balancing. The early cards are particularly egregious in that one player building a relatively expensive 2/1/1/1 [0 pts] card can flip over a 2/1 [0 pts] card for their opponents to enjoy.  Fifteen points does not feel like the right number; it is probably closest to correct in a 4-player game, but 2-player it should probably go to 20/21.  

All this is moot because the points themselves should be refactored to provide less swing-y endgame results (basically double all existing point cards and fine-tune for difficulty (e.g. all the early cards with points become 2 points and the more difficult 0 point cards become 1 point cards).

Couple all of this with stupidly interacting color schemes (study the cards of each suit relative to one another to discover what I mean), and...well, this game needed some more work.  A few quick changes could make this a much more enjoyable filler game, but as-is it feels like they just called it good enough to sell to the masses of idiots who will never investigate what they are playing.

Fun game. Every play are normally tight with close scoring. Luck still play a part.

- Go for high value to gems cards
- Do not be fixated in nobles only
- Colour synergy helps (eg. blue and white)
- Concentrate on at most 2-3 colours 
- Try not to be in competition with more than 2 other players for the same colour
- Only block other players when it is beneficial to you
- Adapt gameplay according to aggressive nature of opponents (i.e., reserve an expensive card when almost half of the required gems are obtained)

Call me blasphemous, but I don't really find it a ton of fun. I like that it's quick, and it's a solid design. But I really dislike the utter dearth of interaction among players. It's 20 - 30 minutes of silently building an engine to pursue your strategy, slightly tweaking plans if someone grabs what you want. Diehards will say I'm playing it wrong probably...

[i]Edit[/i]: Okay, okay, I recently played a couple rounds of this that were actually a lot of fun. Much more interactive than before, due to how we played. So I'm starting to think the lack on interaction in the other rounds I played was more of a player problem and not a game design aspect. I'm coming around on this one a little...

A favorite among much of our development team, great game for a quick 30 minute break with 2 people, often tops out at 1 hour for max. 4 players but still moves quick and maintains a good flow. 

Only gripe is that in 4-player (and sometimes 3-player), it becomes obvious who the victor will be roughly 1 round out. However, rule for final round of play does help to mitigate this issue quite well.

Great balance overall, very sharp art, we can't wait for possible expansions or future revisions of this game!

A easy to learn, easy to teach, strategy game that's difficulty is based by the players at the table. Play is fast as each turn you have three options; Take gems, reserve card, buy card(it could be considered four as "take gems" actually has two different ways.) Cards have victory points along with Noble tiles which are acquired if you have the right cards. When a player reaches 15 the game is in it's final round, allowing all players equal turns. Highest score wins.

Up until recently I thought this game was underrated and should be played more. It's simple, yet has teeth in the game play by blocking opponents plays. After a few plays this month it's been brought back down to earth. Much like Race for the Galaxy, this is probably best played at two player, but can be played at a higher player count. 

The problem is, a weaker player at the table can screw the balance of the game up. If they aren't blocking somebody at the table is going to be having their way. If you are lucky it's you and you win. Unlucky, well enjoy losing a game simply by seating arrangement. It's mightily frustrating to sit at a table and watch someone give somebody else the win as you are too polite or defeated to scream "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP THEM!"

At two players, with evenly matched competition, it's a pretty fun. At more players... you better be really evenly matched.

RATING: 5
Pro's:

1) Great components and art style.
2) The game just feels very well designed, everything seems to just work really well, with the limit on the gems; creating the card tableau; then having to completely rework your strategy based on what another player does.

Con's:

1) The game is really simple, I feel like I've basically "experienced" it to its max potential even though logically I haven't.
2) It's so obviously designed to be streamlined and easy to grasp that it makes it way more dry then it should be. I love euro games and this somehow manages to feel more like a spreadsheet then most of the others I have played.

RATING: 7
Pure set collection. The biggest downfall is the absolute quiet of the game. No player interaction and constant analysis paralysis. It's a game of thinking 3 steps ahead but holding your breath while each other player determines your fate. Every match, the only time anyone has said anything is when the card they've been collecting gem resources for is snatched up; "I wanted that card, dammit!" It's a race to get what you need the fastest and most efficient. But so damn quiet!

RATING: 9
About the same complexity as Takenoko but quite a different experience. Where Takenoko is full of cheers and jeers this one is characterized by quiet meditative tension. As in absolute silence. None of us want to give away our strategy to the other players. I like the game, but it doesn't have the same fun factor as Takenoko. It's chock full of silent hoping.

Interesting light-ish game that reminds me of Ticket to Ride in reverse -- here good collection is fixed and public, but purchasable items are changing and randomized.

Overall, the lack of secret private goals gives this a leg up on Ticket to Ride, and the addition of an economy-building mechanic deepens it, as well.

Hmm. Why is everyone liking this so much? It is certainly not bad, but I don't feel the need to play it much. The decisions are pretty simple, and the game tends to drag just a little bit.

RATING: 8.9
Very simple, enjoyable and addictive game. Resembles the new fast growing genre of casual web and mobile games called "idle" or "incremental" games in a way. Very quick gameplay, and it relies a bit on luck, so it is usually better to play several rounds.

People say it is very shallow, but I don't see that. I cannot seem to ever find the correct move easily. Do I go for the nobles, or rush the 5 point cards? Do I steal my opponents card or do I take 3 tokens? The decisions are very unclear and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable but very light game which seems to be over before it has really begun. I can see why this is so popular but the drawback for me is that for a simple, easy to teach short game, neither the strategy nor the timing (very, very important) are immediately obvious. If the most crucial part of the game is entirely hidden to a new player then I doubt this is one I would be introducing to them and if I have experienced players at the table I would be playing something heavier.

RATING: 6
Sure, Splendor isn’t half as bad as it might have been but it isn’t half as fun as a game should be either: it’s just a different package of the same old «grinding your way to victory (points)» basic mechanism as in any other boring eurogame.

There’s simply no interaction, no talk, no theme, no real challenge when playing Splendor, just taking differently-priced cards (whose art is stunning though) when your turn comes and matching colors to get even bigger rewards. Yawn...

RATING: 6
Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I enjoy playing the game, as its a fun little engine building game with some variety due to the randomness of the cards + the Nobles, however its can be a bit AP inducing which kind of kills it for a "filler".  I have so far played it at 2p & 4p, and it does seem to play well at all player counts (It's supposed to be best with 3p).  I am keeping this one, since I really don't own enough "gateway" type stuff, and this is one I am having fun with.  I don't see it trending up or down, so this is probably a solid 7 from here on out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Splendor is a game that takes the engine building mechanic and makes a card game solely focused on that.  There is no theme, no pretense that you're doing anything but constantly calculating and recalculating the cards each and every turn.  It's a fine little game...but certainly nothing mind blowing.  I suspect the game will be forgotten about in a few years.

Fun simple game that I'm actually pretty good at. With the base game, there are really only two ways to play: go for cheap cards and Nobles or go for high cards and end up with only 6-10 purchases. Cities of Splendor makes the game more varied, which is welcome.

// Fun light economic game. I'm not particularly good at 
coming up with a winning strategy, but it's fun to try. My
only complaint about the game is that it can be too easy
for one person to grab multiple Noble tiles at the same 
time - which can make the game feel like it's ending 
prematurely. Of course, it's fun when I'm able to pull that
off.

Poker style tokens are the biggest magnet to the game ;) just kidding. Splendor is great. It doesn't have strong theme, box is too big and too pretty compared to what's inside. In the box You will find some cardboard tiles, cards and heavy tokens. It is so great to hold them in hand ;) It is a game of chip-collecting and card development. All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent bonus in the future  buys. Some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points (I've changed it to 21 to make game last longer) before your opponents do.

- playing time (30-50 minutes)
- I know many people who don't like this game at all. They don't "feel it".
- After paying for this game You can feel ripped off when You open the box

STRONG RECOMMENDATION.

30 plays:

Elegant, but a little dry compared to the clearer theme of 7 Wonders or the deck-building, play-chaining satisfaction of Dominion. Compared to those, it's almost like solitaire. Frustratingly little player interaction. Each turn presents a small, satisfying decision, though a close game presents analysis paralysis because there's so much useful information to consider. Doesn't seem like the gold coin feature was quite designed right -- it becomes much harder to be clear on which cards you can afford to buy, and at what cost.

I don't understand the hype.  It starts off nice and then after awhile you are just hoping for a lucky card flip.  It doesn't introduce anything new, the theme is pasted on and it is super dry.  The only thing I like is the mechanism of holding a card, but then your opponent just flips a better one that they need.  It plays quick, so at least there is an end to the boredom.

Nice simple engine builder, theme is pasted on but the production is top shelf.  Clay poker chips would be better than the plastic ones long term, but if you've never been spoiled by high end clay chips you won't notice.

The app version can remove the need to own this, as it has quite good variable difficulties.

The game is very simple and elegant yet quite thinky- the rules are two pages but the game feels deep.  Some long term planning but you have be adaptable and you can really strongly mess with your opponents if you try to anticipate their moves.  Great art and nice heavy chips.  Great game.

RATING: 8
Splendor is a 20-30 minute engine building game in which players have only 3 options on their turns - take gems (the currency, in five colors), buy a card, or reserve a card and take a wild gem.  Cards give purchasing power in one of the 5 colors, and possibly points, and come in 3 levels, with higher levels costing more but worth more points.  

I like that Splendor strongly constrains the players options to essentially a single decision each turn.  This makes it very easy to teach.  Turns are short, and the game moves very quickly.  Players' engines build up quickly, which gives a noticeable feeling of progress.  The game usually finishes before it becomes tedious - my wife and I can play a 2 player game in 10-15 minutes.  It plays well from 2 to 4 players, although 4 players gets a little long, and can feel a little more random as well - which cards flip can decide the game.

However, I have found that with experienced players, Splendor can easily be decided by how the cards turn up.  This is a game with essentially a single mechanism and a single strategy (I may be exaggerating a little here, but this is clearly not a "many paths to victory" kind of game).  It is a quick, simple game - a filler - and will disappoint if it is expected to be more than a diversion.  

For me, this is my go-to filler game.  It is great for playing with those with AP, and with non-gamers.  At the price, I consider it an excellent buy, worthy of being in most collections, the exception being "serious" gamers who never play light games with non-gamers.

I prefer this game to Ticket to Ride as my go-to light game because of the smaller footprint and short length. It takes a full game to really get the strategies of each, but Splendor is a game that you could actually reset and play again immediately.

The longer you spend calculating your action each turn, the better you'll do. Thus your quality of play is proportional to how much you annoy your opponents. This is the worst dynamic conceivable.

Very fun and different from what I have. I could see this going down good with pretty much any group of people, and THAT is where the appeal of this game is for me. Simple enough to teach, and yet I can still have fun playing it. 

I'm sure more plays will shed more light on the replayability as I could see it feeling like I'm playing the same game over and over

  With beautifully rendered artwork and quality components, Splendor is perfectly suited for the casual gamer.

   I am a bit hung up on the use of poker-style chips to represent gems.  To enhance its authenticity, I probably would have used glass stones instead; however as is, the game lends itself to those with a colour vision deficiency.

This is a very good game to introduce family members to playing games.  It plays well at 2 and 3 - not sure about 4 as I've only played 2 and 3.  I lost interest in about 8 games, but I don't expect to get rid of it as it's such a great way to hook new players.  Also, those chips.

RATING: 10
Initial rating after 1 play = 8.8 , need to play more. Seems fun, slick and clever. 1/1/15: Am raising to 9.4, played a few more games and top notch. Really impressed by the 2 player game, real arm wrestle and works very well. Edit: Decided to give it 10, played another batch of 2 player games and continues to hold up. Suspect the game might tire due to its lightweight nature still, but no signs yet and rating it for what it is and what it delivers: Quick, accessible, fun, fast playing time, no language dependancy, can play with everyone, skill and great components. Latest Update: still a 10, doubt it will change. This game delivers an exceptional 2 player experience and each game feels different. I also do not think it is getting all the credit it deserves for the depth and tactical thinking required. Brilliant rich and deep 2 player fight and plays just as well 3. Get this game now, it is worthy of the hype and the ultimate game to introduce new people to gaming.

Can play in under 30 minutes so its a nice lunch time game, though it becomes much less fun when you realise that the easiest way to win is to completely ignore both the building of a gem empire engine and trying to attract the nobles.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great, short filler with beautiful components and engaging gameplay. The ability to reserve cards really makes the game strategic, as the cards in your hand often shape your long-term goals. You have to keep an eye on what other players are doing, because it is very likely that someone has their eye on something you want. Going for too many ambitious cards can screw you in the end if someone manages to complete a bunch of smaller cards before you. It takes a few plays of this to get the pacing right: the game usually ends much more quickly than you want.

2/27/2015 - A decent enough game for me to keep around. The design seems a little plain by modern standards. It's effectively an abstract strategy game that will fit right at home next to other 1990s designs in my collection. I'm a bit surprised by the popularity, but it seems well-balanced, even if a bit stodgy and dated in design.

Horrendous misspelling aside, the rest of the game is good - indeed very good. It's a very slickly implemented set collection game, where you always want to do much more than one of the options open to you each turn and have difficulty choosing which, though it's far from a brain burner. That, combined with a very nice production - love the heavy, clicky  poker chip gems - makes it look like a dead cert for a SdJ nomination and a credible winner.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Good, simple, lightweight racing engine-building set collection game.
++ Good replayability from the different Noble cards and how the cards show up, so you must always think how to be the most efficient possible.
++ Super easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Although there is some variability which could lead to a good replayability, it quickly become repetitive and thus, less and less fun to play.
-- It is too light for me (and it's really feel lighter than the BGG weight of 1.8 as of writing this).
-- It's definitely a small game package in a too large box.

Addictive abstract light game with the same core mechanic as Sankt Petersburg (money/VP tipping point) which I like a lot.
In Splendor, the luck factor is stronger (due to color combinations, the arrival of new cards), making it less controlable and more frustrating. But we keep on thinking a lot...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoy Splendor, as I've always enjoyed engine building games, and this one does it very simply and very well.  Basically, players are acquiring and spending colored chips in order to obtain cards.  All of the cards you acquire will give you a permanent chip of a color to spend toward future cards, and some cards also give you points.  First to 15 points wins.

The game strikes a nice balance of needing to build your engine, but also needing to race for points at the same time.  The cheap cards in the game allow you to build that engine more rapidly, but the expensive cards are the ones that also give you points.  So, a balance has to be struck.

Splendor is a great example of a game that is fun for gamers, yet super accessible for non-gamers, as the game can be taught in about a minute.  But, while the rules are simple, the decisions are not always so straight forward.

The only drawback with this game is the theme, which makes it seem as if they didn't even try to think of something reasonable.  Players could have been fighters recruiting heroes to slay monsters, CEOs assembling a work force to finish jobs, star travelers assembling a star fleet to complete missions, or any number of fun themes.  Instead, you get a generic renaissance theme that is really poorly done even as renaissance themes go, and the graphic design is quite uninspired to top it off.  It's really a shame, since the yawn inducing theme and art work may turn people off to what is a really fun game, especially when it comes to the non-gamer crowd which will easily be able to pick up on this game.

None the less, despite the missed opportunity for a good theme that could have added to the fun of playing, Splendor is a great, simple, mechanically fun game that I'd likely never turn down a game of.  Good stuff!

Offered it for Christmas to my stepfather who loves Ticket to Ride. I wanted for him a game with simple rules but still much tension. I loved it and now I want my own copy!

Some games are very fast, if everything turns your way... sometimes it's a battle till the end.

The tokens representing jewels are nicer to play than I thought (my first thought was : "Why not small plastic jewels?" But as soon as I felt them in my hand, I thought they were perfect!). This seems a little detail, but at the end it makes a very neat game!

RATING: 8
Pretty fun. The game does have some luck factor, because cards with equal bonuses are not equally priced. Card A which gives 1 Gem and 1 VP could cost 3 gems, while card B with exactly same bonuses could cost 5. But still its a light and fun party filler, with plenty of strategy, specially in a form of denying others cards you can't buy yourself, or picking out gems you don't actually need, so others won't get them neither.

This is absolutely more what a game should be.  Spencer taught it incredibly quickly and we got rolling with the mechanics of the game.  Although we didn't get the strategy of when to start trying for point cards, or how to get the bonus point cards we really knew what we wanted to do each turn.  I thoroughly enjoyed this, even if it meant we sat in perfect silence, trying to figure what we wanted to do for ourselves.  I also never seemed to know when to start claiming cards for later, instead trying to just get my stuff together to be able to take them sooner from the tableau.  Simple but fantastically deep game.  I must have this and have it soon.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

This is a compelling, solidly designed system. The turns are quick and decisions are interesting. It's just not the sort of game I would play twice in a night.

It's not that Splendor does anything wrong. It just lacks some kind of hook for me. It is a game that is all about Scoring Points. I enjoy a great deal of these kinds of games, but generally they have either one killer mechanic going for them (even No Thanks, possibly the simplest game ever made, has a more tough and juicy mechanical hook) OR have a sense of progression and accomplishment - games where you're building something you can enjoy on an emotional/aesthetic level.

This game lacks both, and so is a game I would not turn down if offered, but will never be one of my great gaming loves.

Update: It is worth pointing out though that there REALLY aren't any other solidly designed economic games that play in this timeframe, so if you've got your heart set on a quick economic game this is IT. And this is still one of the meatiest games you can get in 20 minutes in general so if you don't already have something quick ' meaty (your Biblioses, your Eight-Minute Empires) this'll definitely fit the bill.

About as pure an engine-builder as there is, if you like that sort of thing. Get gems to buy cards which act as permanent gems which allow you to buy more cards and have more gems which allows you to buy more cards and have more gems etc. 

Definite runaway leader problem, but the game is short enough that it is fairly inoffensive anyway. Not bad, but not terribly interesting or fun to me. There is literally zero drama in this game. Plays very quietly. A snoozer.

Having played it three times the first day I got it and four times the next day, which is highly unusual for me, I definitely understand why Splendor has been nominated for Spiel des Jahres! It’s such a good, light family game with a decent amount of strategy. People who say that there isn’t much strategy don’t understand the deeper layers in this game! You can block your opponents and at the start of the game you need to have a plan in order to get at least one of the bonus cards (which is a great feature of the game by the way), otherwise it’s going to be difficult to win.

The simplicity of the gameplay is what makes the game shine: you can do one action on your turn out of four possible actions which are extremely basic and easy to understand. Basically you collect gems to build cards which give you points and a discount on future cards. The first player to 15 (sort of) wins the game; the round is played to the end, but it usually doesn’t matter, though most games seem to be somewhat tight. The game starts out fairly slowly with players grabbing chips, but as you get more cards you also get bigger discounts, so the game speeds up and I think it ends exactly when it should after about half an hour. It’s not exactly a snow-balling effect as the more expensive cards are, well, expensive, so even though you get a discount you still need to pay a lot of chips. But some points give you 4 or 5 points, so the game can end suddenly and you can surprise your opponents - although everything is open information, so they can still try to block you from getting the cards you want. And this is actually a big part of the game, especially in a 2p-game as you really need to watch out for what your opponent can do. One of my plays against my wife was really awesome as we both played extremely well and blocked/reserved the cards the other player needed.

The components are nice, but the box is oversized which I hate due to limited shelf space. My siblings don’t dislike this game which is something that says a lot… Sure, it’s not a heavy gamer’s game, but I think it is suited for gamers too in between bigger games. Definitely take a look, it’s a splendid game (sorry, I had to do it)! It’s so simple yet strangely addicting – I know I am going to play it a lot more! It won’t be for anybody, but it was a hit for me.

RATING: 3
Extremely bland engine building game with a theme that makes no sense. Owning gems makes it easier to acquire more gems? And having a large collection of real gems (as opposed to the fake ones on the chips) attracts historical personalities to your cause? Catching up once you fall behind seems to be very difficult. The poker-like chips are well done.

I've never seen a game draw people in so easily as Splendor does.  Easy-to-learn, fast-paced, with plenty of tension and well made components.  It reminds me a lot of St. Petersburg, with a lot of the administration (i.e. boring) parts removed.  I personally preferred this over Camel Up to win the 2014 Spiel Des Jahres.  

I thought I'd tire of playing it after a few times.  That hasn't happened.  

At least in four player games, there does appear to be a dominant strategy: reserve and/or buy up only the single color cards in the second and third rows (i.e. the cards that require 5, 6, or 7 of only one color).  With some clever hand management, this strategy seems to win a disproportionate number of games.

Solid and simple engine-type building game.  On your turn take some gems or buy a card.  

I can't figure out what it is about this game that makes it so fun an addicting.  At face value it seems almost too simple - but the subtle layers, like the nobles and the ability to reserve cards, add SO much.  Cards look great and the gems are nice poker chips.

Mostly played with 2p.

It's an ok game, I don't understand the rage about it.  I find that the second and third deck are rarely used.  It's a bit unbalanced in that regard.  The suprising thing is that you would have thought the designer would have thought of this and done something about it.

I have been sucked into the hype. Played it once and immediately wanted to play it again. Shame it was our closer for the day. I definitely could see playing this with my wife as a simple tableau builder it works extremely well. Our first game we played it in the 30 minutes as advertised which never happens. Some say the game ends too quickly, but to me that is where the beauty is. Somehow Splendor allows you to build a good engine quickly and still keep the game lightning quick so that you want to play it again.

For a very simple game, it has a nice arc and - if you are paying attention - a reasonable amount of player interaction.

Haven't thought about needing a San Juan-type game for a while...

Really good game for two players and relatively quickly too. My wife always wins or I might have rated higher! I love the nice heavy poker chip style tokens. I'm not super into the gem theme but the artwork and simple game play with deep strategy is fantastic. Games tend to be kind of quiet though. It can be more fast paced and social in the right atmosphere but if you're more competitive or when the stakes are high (like when my pride is on the line after a 7 game losing streak), you spend alot of time planning every turn. Overall this is a must own for a 2 player friendly game collection.

Faceted gems are a love of mine ever since my brief training way back when so the theme is there for me. Other than that, this is a fun, meditative, abstract, engine-building exercise that is more satisfying than appearances would suggest.

It plays fantastically with 2, 3, or 4 players, which is a real plus. Two players is more strategic whilst 4 is more tactical.

My boyfriend made one tiny complaint though - he wishes each card had unique artwork as you end up seeing all the card art several times throughout the game. After playing a few times, I have to agree (though I understand the costs associated with unique card art, so it is not a big deal).

This game is so simple and lean, I don't understand why I enjoy it so much. I believe I'm most competitive with my wife (she beats me all the time), to the point we played a round at the hospital post delivery of our second child....she won....she deserved it. I often ask people if they would like this game as much as they do without the chips. Pretty much the unanimous answer is "No". Let's be real. Components don't make the game, but they do definitely improve it. The components in this game add so much fun to the game that had this used cardboard chits, I don't think it would have been on my radar. This is a perfect blend of game play & component quality.

This is a great light weight game that you can introduce new players to the concept of an engine with. Still, it also has enough to satisfy the serious gamers desire for a solid strategy.

Played twice in a row. Almost won my first game, and pulled the second game's win out of nowhere, getting almost all my points in a single turn. It has three distinct strategies, as far as I can tell: Go for lots of small cards to get nobles, go for big cards just to get points from those while ignoring nobles, or get small cards to build up to occasional big cards and grab nobles on the way. Or what I did my first game, grab whatever you can afford at all times and collect random gems. That almost worked because often planning was ruined, but being able to reserve a card was an underutilized ability that could've mitigated that. But in the end it is a really quick light game that is enjoyable to play, but now wholly satisfying

RATING: 6
Very pleasant escalation game that is quick and can be easily taught to non-gamers, with enough complexity to keep things interesting for all. Minus points for the awfully big box for the size of the game, and for the fair amount of luck which will most certainly swing the game once players become more experienced with formulating a strategy. Nevertheless, for what it is, recommended as a gateway game.

This is a good game that is light in complexity and a moderate difficulty of action choices. the game rarely has a run away player as the game results are usually a tight race. Replay-ability is  right because game play is not too long and game variance is high. The theme is week but ends up irrelevant in my opinion. There are better games but this will hit a sweet spot better than others like it because of the average game duration.

Engine building/set collection game. Simple to introduce players to.

Scratches the same itch as dominion while being a much simpler game. Good amount of strategic decision making where you have to chose between a number of simple to comprehend choices. Depending upon the tiles and cards that come up there are a number of viable strategies - going for an engine that allows you to build up to inexpensive victory points or just rushing straight for the 5VP card. The 15VP goal is low enough that you can just rush points but high enough that sometimes an efficient engine is better.

Strategy varies depending upon the number of players playing because of the changing ratio of money/player, pursuing sets that nobody is going for and having more/less players to block.

The poker chips are a very satisfying weight.

Some games swoop in and become our dominant games for a while. We've played this so many times and with a lot of different people. The components are so satisfyingly solid! The fun artwork and components seem to draw in new gamers. The decisions are pretty straightforward, enough so that most people we've played the game with end up really enjoying it. My wife and I have had some fun battles in the 2 player version of the game. So, even more experienced players can squeeze good strategic value out of it. At the end of the day, without expansions, the replay value has capped out for us and we are far less likely to play Splendor vs other two player games in our collection.

It's interesting, but individual groups seem to go through the same few patterns with this. Everyone starts out with a basic engine-building strategy. Eventually, players figure out they can get an edge on the engine-builders if they go for a high-tier strategy. Other players figure out they can easily derail the high-tier strategists by hoarding the gems they need. And you end up with a well-balanced game with multiple winning approaches... at which point, the game is mostly determined by the random order that the cards turn up in. Well, that's disappointing. This started as an easy favorite, but unfortunately it just bores me at this point.

It is a good, but not great game. It is easy to get to the table, but sometimes lacks strategy. I feel like there is a first player advantage for the noble tiles.

Pequeño juego familiar que ha gustado mucho en mi entorno. Sus reglas sencillas y sus rápidos turnos hacen que vea mesa con facilidad. El juego se podría resumir en coger fichas para comprar cartas que te darán puntos y descuentos para comprar mas cartas. La partida finaliza cuando alguien llega a 15 o mas puntos.

That was a very fun game.  Collecting gem cards, to get
higher value gem cards. Very fun.

One drawback was both games we played, the person that started first won. Secondly, you couldn't do anything with a card once you got it. In other words they weren't
action cards, so in that sense the game is quite basic.

edit: June 2015

this game is getting progressively less fun. It is too simple.

Love this game, though I can see that it might not appeal to everyone since it's rather simple. In this game you collect gems (in the form of cards and poker chips) to purchase more gems, all with the goal of becoming a reputed gem merchant who may attract the attention of noble patrons. Certain gem cards have points, as do the noble cards you can obtain if you fulfill certain card hands, and the first person to 15 points wins. 

This is one of those gateway games that I can teach quickly to anyone and that will be fun to play as a 20-30 minute filler. I taught this to my husband's 70 year old grandma and she raved about how much she enjoyed it.

Great gateway game with excellent components.  Played 3p initially and thought the game was unbalanced, but we had neglected to remove 2 of each gem (except gold).  Once that was fixed, the game tightened up nicely and the push for big cards didn't result in an automatic win. My kids (9 and 12) love this one too!

Addicting game that will grow on you.  Looks a little bit overwhelming at first, and for players with AP this is a drawback (I have enforced the use of a 30 second timer).   It is a satisfying feeling watching your gem empire grow as your prepare for taking the larger point cards to ensure your win.  Nice balance between solitaire engine building and competition.

RATING: 5
That's it? The box is only "slightly" large for what's in it:
[imageid=1991004 medium]

That was my initial reaction, not just when opening the game, but also when reading the rules and playing. Admittedly I didn't do much research (I rarely do), but given the box size and hype (from trusted sources), I expected this to be a bit more complex. At least like St. Petersberg or Carcassonne level. But this is a very very very simple card game. It's is clearly a filler. There's a ton of luck, but enough decisions that it's still fun. Something on par with like Biblios or something. 

This has to be one of the worst recent offenders for percentage of space that is air in the box. Put this game in a box half the size and I'd raise my rating a full point. I like the chunky tokens (perhaps the chunkiest of any game I own), but they could be laid flat in one cylinder with the cards next them. Ridiculous waste of space.

First impression: Nice bits and graphics, but gameplay leaves me a little cold. Almost no interaction and no tabletalk make this games not really entertaining for me. Maybe this changes with more plays, but I have doubts ...

Second impression: I think this games shines with two or three players most. With four players (or even five, we tried this with a simple variant) there is too much going on between my turns. Nothing is really planable so the game becomes a real luckfest.

RATING: 5
A game which boils down the pattern of snowballing to its utmost basics, stripping everything away that could possibly be interpreted as a distraction. It's even more basic in this approach than is ageing St. Petersburg; and probably attracts the same people too. Do not believe people who claim that the game is empty and without skill: they are wrong, and they know it. There is definitely skill in managing the turn order cycles, and whether or not to go for a blocking move instead of furthering your own position. These may be simple deliberations, but [i]simple[/i] is not the same as [i]absent[/i], which happened to be the point of the naysayers. 

However, I do also feel that once players begin to get a feeling for the various paths and options, that luck of the draw will [i]worsen[/i]. Someone who accidentally uncovers a 'free' card for his left neighbour for example puts himself in [i]gote[/i] through no fault of his own. It was just luck which caused the card to appear as it did. So between experienced players more lookahead is a must. This isn't difficult to accomplish, of course, but the absense of such a rule still dents Splendor's gleaming exterior.

In the end I think I like the game for what it is. It shouldn't be compared to much more difficult and complex snowballs, as it won't survive that comparison. This is not meant to be a gamer's game; I even think that a serious gamer will be done with it after a handful of attempts because it all boils down to discovering not-all-that-hot relations in the upgrade paths with ever lessening upgrade efficiencies. Nevertheless, given its strong limitations it actually accomplishes what it sets out to do rather well. This is an easy game to explain to families, and the artwork and solid gem execution aid this process tremendously. Consequently I'm generous with my rate.

Fantastic game when its all new and shiny and players are having a ball learning how to  best build a winning strategy against one another. Loved it, gave it an 8 rating.

As time wore on my play group has gotten more savvy at the game and honestly, the game has lost all it's shine. Now the games are almost completely quiet, tense, concentration fests. Nerves are on edge and when some players lose they take it kinda hard. What a bummer. I still like the game but I have to rate it a 6.5 now, not willing to play it so much anymore.

Now to be fair, not all play groups will have the same experience as mine, just saying, be warned if you have even semi-competitive people in your groups, this game can start to be a bit of a downer after awhile.

Another acquisition oriented towards quick play and quick rules explanation.  Splendor can be taught/learned in about 10 minutes and plays in half an hour. 
 The game is simple-- take chips so you can buy cards for victory points.  Cards purchased then provide the bonus of acting as chips towards future buys.  
The components in this game, particularly the hefty poker chips, are of good quality and make the game even more enjoyable.   
Great game, for 2 to 4 players, light strategy with a small luck component.  Recommended.

This game is decent but deceptive to experienced gamers. It [i]looks[/i] like you should be able to build an engine by purchasing lower-level cards and eventually work your way into swiftly buying many expensive point cards/nobles for cheap. However, in reality, the game usually ends before the engine actually pays off.

Also, this game suffers from the same kind of randomness exhibited by Power Grid's auctions - you never know when buying a card from the table may just flip over a much better card for your opponents to buy. This is unavoidable and therefore mildly annoying.

An okay game if you don't take it too seriously.

This game lives up to its fast-earned reputation. First thing I noticed when I opened the box, after the great organization design? Amazing artwork! Every inch of this game is beautifully rendered, and the gem chips are so satisfying to hold and clack against one another, with the heft of thick poker chips. Completes the theme very well, highly pleasant to look at, and makes the overall game much more fun to play.

Splendor reminds me of the best part of the real time strategy games we all love: the engine-building phase - the central mechanic in this game of spending gems to purchase developments which, in effect, yield more gems, which build the engine to yield more developments, etc. The system is simple and elegant, flows naturally and seamlessly, and is very satisfying with immediately apparent benefits.

The game moves quickly, while there is a good amount of strategy, balancing between collecting gems, reserving and buying developments, and blazing a path to prestige points and acquiring favor from nobles, which takes careful planning with each step, with a view toward the final goals. Don't save up gems too long, or your fellow greedy merchants will steal your prize before you can get to it!

Great fun with lots of player interaction, a short, addictive game with good decisions that doesn't require a ton of brain power on a Friday eve - fantastic for families or any group who enjoys the thrill of a well-themed game of fortunes.

You would think that a game with instructions this simple just wouldn't be any fun, especially when one turn is similar to the next.  But in fact, it's quite enjoyable and plays very fast.

Players can take a few different types of gems, eventually "buying" a card which will give a discount in the future.  You keep acquiring those and then have a number of turns where you can afford anything - but which ones to choose in order to get you the most points?  Or the favor of a visiting noble?  You also need to think about the endgame - once someone hits 15 points, the round plays out and it's over.  You have to be careful not to end things prematurely if someone can beat you on their last turn.

Super fast, super easy, thick tokens and nicely illustrated cards.  This is a great filler for gamers.

Played many times with 2 and 3 players.  2-player game is quick and competitive.  More players brings in a bit more luck and disrupts strategy, but still fun.

Played it with middle school students and every one of them loved it.  Odd theme that's pretty irrelevant to game play, but addictive as all get out.

Feels good when it comes together at the end.  During the last 2 player play my wife hit 17 with a visit from a merchant.  And I managed to hit 18 after a visit a well - just as well as I had far more cards down.  Little bit of luck in terms of which merchants turn up.  
My son dislikes the game because he always wins - funny how going for the 5 points with all of the yellow coins nearly always works as a strategy and he doesn't budge.  Any time I try mimicking him I'm to tempted to grab a few cheap rubies and there simply not room for any extras.

A nice simple game, good to introduce to family members, and nice to play with the wife. Scales up nicely to bigger games.

Pros: Easy to learn, really nice chips, can have some nice strategic card reservation plays

Great, shorter game. This game is fun for gamer, non-gamers, and those entering the hobby as well. Surprisingly meaty for how small it is, yet surprisingly easy to learn. I sort of have a strange soft spot for this game. It just fills a niche in my game collection very nicely.

Oh, and btw, the poker chip components of this game are GREAT quality. They are a heavier plastic and just feel really good in your hand. It's strange how good components can really add to the experience. Its the difference between playing Chess with a nice weighted set or a cheap, light plastic one.

Incredibly pure distillation of an infrastructure game. As usual, you want purchasing-power early and points late; the challenge comes from the constraints of what cards are available. (What you have to pay with may not be what the cheaper infrastructure cards require, or the colors they provide may not be what you need for nobles or for more expensive cards you're eyeing for later in the game.)

So you have to flow with the available options, which may sometimes mean breaking that "infrastructure first" heuristic, and *that's* interesting. (As is the potential for sniping out key steps in opponents' buildups, and the counter of reserving cards at a relative cost.)

Splendor is an elegant, little engine builder with really nice components, but I can't honestly say that I enjoy it. The whole game is taking chips to buy cards to score points, while trying to mess up a bit with your opponent's plans in the process. Every single move is meaningful, but the overall experience is dry, solitaire and themeless. If you're looking for a light, yet interesting card drafting game, I'd rather play 7 Wonders Duel over Splendor any day.

Components: Lovely artwork, though without names on the cards, there isn't much theme. The tokens are wonderfully hefty.

Experience: Amusing, but not a ton of fun. The available cards seem to be relatively balanced, such that it doesn't really matter what a player specializes in. Some players will have better opportunities than others to dovetail with the bonus tiles. Not a lot of planning ahead, since it's just about looking around for the best bang for my buck each turn.

RATING: 3
The description for a "3" reads "Likely won't play this again, although could be convinced.  Bad."  The pretty much sums up how I felt about this game.  I didn't have very much fun playing it.  Your mileage may vary.

It's nothing more than a mechanism.  You build an engine by buying stuff that allows you to buy more stuff more efficiently.  Eventually one player has fine-tuned their array to the point where they win.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that idea, but I'm frankly tired of "building an engine" when I should be playing a game.  I would rather be interacting rather than reacting.  This game felt like a lot of reacting: "Fred bought the card I thought I wanted.  Now what do I do?"  

Not my idea of fun, but I'd play it again with the right group.  It's 20 minutes of activity with the opportunity to cuss Fred out once in a while.

After my first couple of plays, I knew I wanted to own this game.  So far, it remains a game I will happily play any time.  It's not the main course of a game night, but it's certainly good enough to get the night started or to wrap it up.  On its own, it's a game that hits on an average evening where we just want to relax and play a short, fun game.

Now that I've had this one for about a year, I've begun to wonder if I really like it or not.  I don't carry it to game nights anymore, and I don't pull it out unless requested.

About the only way I enjoy it anymore is with 2 players.  I may enjoy it with 3.  It's merely an exercise in sweat management and frustration with 4.

Lots of interesting things to do in this small game.  Build your engine, but not too slowly, because the game will end before you are ready.  The use of chips is a welcome improvement over bits of simulated gems or coins.

The rare game that takes 3 min to teach, 15+ minutes to play, and rewards such a variety of approaches and strategies that you'll want to play another game as soon as it's over, either to reinforce your existing strategy or to try something completely new. Much deeper than its ultra-simple rules might make it appear. To boot, the game has fantastic artwork, very nice packaging, and there's a very polished mobile app available (with tablet interface!) if that's your thing. Well worth a purchase.

One thing to beware: it may become the only game anyone wants to play.

One of the best abstract games I have ever played. I say that because it has a very pasted on theme, but that doesn't diminish it's playability. I can teach this to 'anyone' because it is a non language dependant game and a great family game because of the simple rules. Don't let the simpleness of the rules deter you though, it's not a game easily mastered and each game is a different beast. If I would give my vote to a game for 2014 Spiel des Jahres it would be this game because it is a game for everyone.

Splendor is an elegant, simple game that plays quickly, and does a great job of balancing fun with competitive play.  You'll be spending your time trying to build up sets of cards to let you buy the more valuable cards as well as hoarding gems to get those cards. Part of the fun and cleverness of Splendor is figuring out what other players are doing and making sure they don't kibosh your plans - but they will, because they're figuring out what you're doing to make sure you don't kibosh their plans.

I bought Splendor on sale because I thought me and my wife would enjoy it. It had a lot of hype and what not. I really dislike it. I didn't find it nearly as fun as everyone else. I think my issue is that it based on direct player interaction. You do everything you can to screw people over and you basically win. I just have not enjoyed it in the 3 times I've played.
I would play if someone asked me to but I wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather play 7 Wonders for a engine builder. 

Edit: played again after over a year. It was better this time around. It's okay, not a favorite but no longer a 3.

I rate this game a 4 out of respect for the praise and enjoyment so many others seem to give and get from it. But honestly, I would be hard-pressed not to flatly refuse to play it again. I hated it that much.

It's just -- it doesn't feel like a "game" to me, it feels like a math problem. There's no luck or randomness really, it's just straight solving the best and most efficient way to score points based on the cards that are out there and how you can lightly interfere with another player by taking the last of a certain gem color. Where is the fun??? The theme is meaningless. The art is well-drawn but has no life to it.

This game is just so cold and soulless.

Take gems, spend gems on cards. Cards provide discount on other cards and some are worth points. Players accumulate both gems and cards to collect enough cards to equal or exceed 15 points. First to 15 wins.

Nice quick game, the haptic sensation (and most of all, the weight) of the gem-chips makes this game in my opinion. Not liking it all that much, one can get easily locked out of chips in a 1v1 and can't really plan much in a 4 player game, generall I don't feel like there is that much choice involved.

It just doesn't excite me all that much to be honest. It's a nice little game (in a box much too big for it which I hate) but will never be much more than an easy filler. Which is fine, there's just games out there that do what splendor does better. Though I can see the appeal and realize I am in the minority here, considering how popular this game is.

Splendor is a quick very pure engine builder with a tiny bit of set collection.  The mechanic is fun and I feel like I'm actually building something when I play it, but then the game is over.  It feels like I should be able to do something with the engine I build, I kind of wish Splendor was half of another game.

RATING: 7
I find this to be a neat game.  It plays quickly, but there is still an arc to the game.  It is super easy to teach, but there are still interesting decisions to be made.  There is some interactivity provided by the limited supply of cards.  One can take the card your opponent needs to win.

Most of the decisions seem to be tactical, but there is some strategy to be had.  Since the tier 2 and 3 cards tend not to cycle as much, you can plan ahead.  

This game is really easy to get to the table even with non-gamers, but it still holds enough interest for more serious gamers to enjoy too.

I was skeptical of Splendor despite all the high praise. It just didn't seem like my type of game. Then I played it at a game night and really enjoyed it. To me, this games kills 7 Wonders (minus its lackluster theme) because there's that same aspect of building up and taking other cards that people really want, but in a much more public and interactive way. I also really like the simple supply-and-demand economic system of the chips and the checks and balances it provides. Even the chip play is interactive in that you either need people to play their chips to free them up or grab chips before the other players do. In all, it fosters some of those great game moments when it isn't about your movement as much as it is guessing what the others will do.

Comes to the table all the time.  With my kid, with gamers, with non-gamer friends.  After one quick game, everyone gets it.  Slick game.  Great poker chips as gems.

After several plays, I started seeing the different strategies - going for the nobles; going for gem cards that are important to acquire middle-tier cards; and all the while trying to stock up for a big 4 or 5 point 3rd tier card.  And on top of that, trying to combine these strategies to achieve more than one of them.  One of my most played games of the past several months.

Excellent strategy game that appeals to both casual and heavier board game players. 

The luck element is greatly diminished (which I enjoy) but casual players are still able to pick out a goal and accomplish it while still being competitive. 

This game is slightly overpriced (currently $30) but a large portion of that budget goes to excellent poker-style chips used to represent "gem" resources. If you can pick this up for $20 on an Amazon sale it is a staple in any collection!

RATING: 5.5
Easy to pick up, and well-calibrated for the kind of game it is.  I could imagine it having a little more in the way of trade-offs and downsides (e.g. some cards that offer victory points but no machine-building) but it's already at risk of being a multiplayer solitaire situation, so probably good that there's nothing else slowing down the decision making.  The theming is pretty thin, though - even slapping names on the cards might have added something.

RATING: 7
Light entry-level game that is fairly fun with the right audience. This isn't really a game I'd play with a gamer audience, but it's a decent (if unspectacular) family game. Pretty thin theme: it doesn't feel like you're accomplishing anything thematically. Despite its target of the family market, it didn’t really connect with my family.

RATING: 5
Average card drafting victory point earning filler. It has the potential to be really good, but seems to be missing something - I think replayability is the issue, as it tends to get a bit samey after a while. Not sure it deserves all the hype.

RATING: 6
Really fun game of super-quick sprints up a very basic tech tree. 2p can be about 15 minutes, probably +15 per player since you can't plan ahead with more than 2.

I think I like 2p best although all counts work very well.\

EDIT: Emphatically did not stand up to multiple plays. Extremely samey from play to play.

I originally rated Splendor a 7, but the more I play it the more I appreciate its elegant design. Baseball fans marvel at the 90-foot space between bases; the perfect distance for a quality defensive play but enough that any mistake is punished. Splendor's 15 point victory condition is the board game equivalent. This is a true classic and I would now honestly call it one of my favorite games of all time.

RATING: 5
Similar to Dominion in that this is a 'mechanic' looking for a game to be in.

A provisional rating after half a play and watching a learning game. A simple rule set for what appears to be a reasonably intriguing filler - will it have the legs for repeated plays given it's completely abstract and simple mechanics.

It also comes in an absurdly large box for what is 3 decks of cards and a handful of poker chips - the art is nice but the theme is nowhere.

Not a whole lot to this game.  Hope good cards come up to match your resources.  Buy low or no-vp cards to build economic engine early.  Convert over to more expensive VP cards late.  Nothing really new here. This game is way over-hyped. Oh, and forget theme...there isn't much splendor there.

Simple optimization game where players are building an income engine, obtaining gems, and investing income/gems into making that engine more efficient.  The cards increase the income, and the better cards award victory points.  Sets of cards attract Nobles, also worth points.  The game ends when somebody crosses 15 points, highest score wins.  

Nice looking, very simple game, in an oversized box with large, weighty poker chip gem pieces.  If you took the nice pieces away, I suspect this game would be seen for what it is - almost an activity in optimization that plays itself.  Harmless and pretty.

RATING: 9
You take gem tokens in order to trade up for better-value gems and attract the nobility. 

A very tight engine-building game. The heavy poker chip-like gem tokens are very satisfying to move around, and the artwork is bright and evocative, even if the theme is pretty light. 

The lightweight gameplay and quick playing time should make this an excellent gateway game. Best with 2 or 3 players. 

Not a perfect 10 simply since with four players it's harder to build a strategy and can be unsatisfying when your options are stripped away by the other players.

The simplest possible engine-builder. Get gems, spend them for discounts on gems (some of which come with points). There's a reasonable amount of jockeying for in-demand gem colors, blocking in the form of reservation capability (which also gives wild gems that can ease pressure on particular colors). All of this is added to the conventional switching problem -at what point do I shift from infrastructure to points?

I appreciate simplicity, so this game is right in my wheelhouse, but I'm not sure the game is mean enough for me. Blocking can be more costly for you than for your opponents, as the gems they build up can be used to get alternate infrastructure/points. While this doesn't fit my tastes, it works well with newer or more conflict-averse players

This feels like a game that is over-hyped.   The mechanics are dead simple...  take chips, or spend chips to play a card.    I appreciate that there is a little engine building, and maybe even a little bit of Sackson's Bazaar in here, but I'm worried that this is a pretty boring game that will get stale very quickly.   It's very repetitive.  The only real attraction are the heavy plastic chips with stickers, and some of the card art.

I loved Splendor when I first started playing it. The chunky poker-chip style resources. The gradual building of a stock of permanent resources. While a lot simpler than true engine-building, it still hit a lot of the same spots.

These days, the group is a little bored of it. Games follow a very similar pattern, and rarely distinguish themselves from other rounds we've played. I've heard Spice Road has a similar feel, but produces a strong sense of purpose and engine-building. I'll have to try it out to see if this is the case.

RATING: N/A
An extremely good two-player game (can be played with 2-4 players). The game is pretty quick and addictive too. I probably played about 20 times during the first week I got it, mainly with two-players. 

It's an engine-building game in a way, where cards that you have played (they remain in front of you), will provide discounts for your future purchases. 

I played it with three once, and didn't like the downtime, although it's not long at all. Probably I'm so used to the speed in a two-player game.

After plenty of two-player games, I can see that the winning strategy lies on grabbing the noble cards. Getting 2/3 of the nobles bags you six points already, and that's a big deal. Getting all nobles then becomes a huge deal. One thing I didn't like much is how third tier cards are less claimed. Maybe not in a multi-player game.

Anyway, I was proved wrong one time, when my opponent (two-player game) won the game without any nobles, while I had three nobles.

RATING: 6.5
Such simple rules disguising a rather tense engine building game.  The tension is from the race itself, which always seems to be close no matter what you do, and the choices you have to make.  The forfeiting of a turn to reserve a card is a particularly interesting dynamic which presents tough decisions.

In some respects I feel that this is a fairly basic single mechanic which has been made into an entire game, and perhaps it would benefit in being as part of a greater game.  But then on the other hand this essential simplicity and short game-play is what makes the game so attractive.  So on balance I'm sold and have since purchased a copy.  It may tire after a few plays but until that time I am looking forward to investigating it some more.

UPDATE: the game is too processional and dry.  I have sold my copy.

One of the greatest drafting games. The theme is the worst part, it doesn't fit at all. It could be about recollecting fruits or lego parts, and in fact, it doesn't matter. 

It's a game for thinking for a while, trying to do the best move, and don't be far away for your opponents, by buying or reserving cards (that give you a bonus). You gonna have all your friends entertained and in some kind of silence, because of the game demands your attention for what type of gems are you picking up, and which one the others too. So, you could buy the cards without before the rest of the players. The main reasons to buy the cards before other players are 1) the price of future cards descend because the cards owned act like discounts; and 2) if you reach a goal of cards marked in other tiles (Nobles), you take them, giving you better chance to win the game. 

The game finished when a round is ended because a player reaches the 15 points (some cards and all nobles had values or winning points), that means that all players had the same number of turns.

RATING: 7
In Splendor players are jewel merchants that are collecting different gemstones to attract the attention of nobles.  The theme is pretty much pasted on and it plays very much like an abstract game. 

During a turn, players choose certain gem chips or use collected chips to purchase cards that provide a certain type of gem and possibly score certain points.  The game play is very straightforward and easy to teach/learn.  The game plays like an engine builder and the strategy is different every game depending on what cards and nobles are in play.

Player interaction is limited to taking cards/chips that someone else might need.  Of all the games I own, this one plays the most silently as everyone is staring intently at the field and contemplating their moves.  Even Blokus has more trash talking!  

This is a fun game for those that dislike direct player conflict and want a short, strategic game that is simple and very elegant.  Definitely recommended.

Splendor is a very clean, streamlined game whose simple effectiveness reminds me of a Knizia design in some ways.  The learning curve is very small, the cards and gems are excellent and everyone who plays it seems to really like it.

Gem collection seems to bring out the worst AP in me... otherwise a very quick, fun 2 player experience, where every decision could lead to victory, or utter loss. Ultimately this is a very light filler game where the result is never close - it's always apparent who is going to win about halfway through.

30-45m, 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

I've had a lot of success with splendor; wife, mother, mother-in-law, etc. Simple enough to teach in a few minutes but enough interesting decisions to keep everyone engaged. There's also a deep tension in every game, part of this is thinking through your strategy rest of it is hoping someone else doesn't take your card.

Also... the Android app is pretty fun

This was a birthday present that I was not expecting at all. We all caught up with the rules and gameplay really fast. This game is pure addiction and it is a joy to see your engine keep getting better and better, especially when you can acquire cards for free. I agree with the trend that the game is more or less a one-trick pony and I see its potential to get burnt because of too many plays. Use with caution and you will have a lot of fun. Great to lure non gamers into a couple plays :)

Splendor is a relatively quick race to 15 points. It's an engine-building card game where the players are collecting coloured chips to match various cards on a three-tier display of cards. The tiers increase in cost and points value. When taking chips, you either take three different colours or two of the same (assuming it has at least so many (it's more than two but I can't recall the exact number). When you complete a card, it goes into your tableau and gives you a virtual chip of a specific colour. You can also reserve a card which you want to build or your opponent wants to build and are given a consolation wild chip. Beyond the three-tiered display, there are some noble tiles which require sets of  specific-coloured cards to be complete to claim them. All of this drives a quaint, but relatively ho-hum system. It's quick and easy to play and explain, it's attractive, and probably a good gateway or family game. There are just other games that fit this category that I'd rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Although Splendor does not have layers of strategy that lead to post-game discussions about key moves that players made that cost/won them the game, it is an amazing game for the category it falls into: light, fun, quick to setup/teach/learn/play. Of course, I have to mention the quality of the components, too - specifically the poker-style gem tokens. Holding the tokens while you ponder your next move adds an unexpected pleasant aspect to the game. I find the game to be kind of addictive... when I finish one game I want to immediately play another!

This game is an amazing little engine-builder. Despite the size of the box, the game has very little in it. But what IS there is the essentials of hard-decision making and engine building. I expect this to be one to hook people into games, as well as provide an interesting game for experienced gamers. Most times I've played it, it has come down to a single turn for the win.

This is a very solid game that I would suggest to anyone newer to gaming (and veterans of gaming should still check this out... just saying it's a good entry level game).  It is simple to learn but has some good strategy elements to it with minimal luck.  It also has good components and comes in a well thought out package.  My only qualm is after a while the games all feel the same so it doesn't have the replayability of other games.

Splendor has a smooth simple interface which I love in a game, some lackluster graphics, nice tactile pieces, but in the end becomes very dull after a few plays. Also, feels like there is a definate advantage to going first, to be able to claim the very important person tiles before other players.

Blandly computational engine building game with pasted on theme - might just as well have been about training police dogs or icing doughnuts.  Random factors significant determinants of victory.

Plays fast and has a nice set collection feature to it. Not terribly deep. Great to play with your stupid friends. There is a ton of luck involved, as to when cards come up and what color they might be, how much they cost. Still I don't mind playing, it plays fast and there is a little strategy as to when to hoard, what colors to focus on, whether to buy a few expensive gems or a lot of cheap ones.

Its got a pretty face, and that's about it. Perhaps I'm missing something, but this game feels incredibly scripted. Target the high prestige cards and pick up a noble on the way. Not only that, but despite the random nobles and nature of drawing cards, each game plays very similarly. With only a path or two of worthy strategies to explore, this game burns out quickly.

Simple, elegant rules with great components but just didn't enjoy the monotony of scanning the grid of tiles as well as what others have collected each turn.  In addition, you can usually tell who is going to win a turn or two before the end making it feel anti-climactic.

Good filler game, lasts around 30-40 minutes and is well thought out and designed with nice artwork. Our edition had good quality cards and chips. Easy to pick up with good replay value. The creators have attempted to incorporate a story line into the game, but I think it's lost. However, the game itself doesn't really lose anything by a slightly weak narrative. We've tried it with 2, 3 and 4 players of different ages and I was concerned there might be a lot of waiting around between shots, but that's not been the case. There is certainly depth and strategy in how you approach collecting resources and prestige points and this provides interest and high addictive value.

Played once, very disappointed.

Very simplistic and boring.  About the level of Coloretto.  Collect resources, buy a card.... that's it.  No player interaction other than hoping someone doesn't buy the card you want.  There's basically nothing to the game.

Definitely would not waste my time on this again  

Update 4-18-2015: Played again, 2 player.  Significantly better this way.  Much more tactical and interactive.  Still not a great game (plenty of other games do tactical better without any randomness), but 2-player I would call it probably a 6.  With 4 players it is still a 3, so I'll average it out to a 4.5

Why is this game so popular? Granted, the idea of the game seems simple and attractive enough. But it's already horribly prone to AP, and makes it worse in that the game situation is fluid right up to the point of a player's turn. The player can't have used his/her downtime to think his/her moves, and now the other players must wait for him/her.

Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops—all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.

On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card—in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it—you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.

All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.

Rating based on one 4-player game.  Mixes some mechanics from 7 wonders and ticket to ride into a very original game. I like that its simple and fast paced and has some smarts to it.  Theres also plenty of "screw your opponent" which I like.  It has some luck in that cards that come up late in the game could already fit what people have giving them easy points.  Not sure if this is deep enough for a ton of plays but is a nice filler type game.  I will say it can get quiet during play as people are always thinking about their next move but the "screw you" factor breaks the ice quite often.

Really simple game with beautiful production. Great as gateway game and filler. However, it's rather light on theme and pretty mechanical. While manipulating the pieces is fun (because they are awesome) I don't get great satisfaction at the end of the game. Yes, you start out with nothing and accumulate gems, but they don't lead to much besides points so you don't get the feeling of actually having built something. So while it's probably one of the best gateway games out there at the moment and for some reason really appeals to the lady gamers, I don't feel the urge to play it often or multiple times in a row because it's not enjoyable enough for me.

This is a great easy entry game for non-gamers, with a barely pasted on generic theme that doesn’t really mean anything but won’t turn anyone off. The game is fast to set up and not that bad to take down, the rules are pretty easy to explain, the choice of actions are limited, but the strategies are diverse. Light and fast, it’s a great filler game, or one to play multiple times in a row as a casual pastime.

This game feels suitable for a range of gamers, except those who only engage with highly-themed games with high complexity.

This is one of my wife's favorite games because she enjoys it but more importantly because she wins almost 100% of the time even on my best days. It is a great game that has an extremely fast setup and offers a lot of brain burning strategy for a 30 minute game. Will you spend time buying up cheap gems that will ultimately give you the ability to buy more expensive gems rapidly or do you rack up the expensive gems and beat the opponent to 15 points before they have time to get their engine going. Amazing and frustrating each and every time.

Funny how divisive this game seems to be, but for once I’m with the majority. I love the game for what it is – a distilled resource collection/VP purchasing game. There’s room for blocking (oh, how we love to take cards from one another) and different ways to go about getting to 15 points. Luck can play a part here, for sure, but it’s short enough that you can drop another quarter and play again.

another filler game that feels like Ticket to ride with set collection options. as a twist the cards you purchase create permanent colors for future purchases, so much so that the order that you collect cards can set up a chain of purchases allowing you to play without taking chips for several turns. A winner will be angling towards the bonus tiles ASAP. Not sure that the reserve mechanic is of any use, but I'm sure this will be played often enough to suit my interest.

Got the iPhone app version (Dec 2105) on a $.99 deal.  So addicted to this game.  This may make my 10 ranked games before the new year.  This game is cool. Love the race feeling I get every time I assess the other players selection and wonder if I'm behind.  Scales 2-4 well.  People keep telling me their families play it, don't know if I could introduce this to mine.

Simply the best quick, small and deceptively simple game.  Nearly everyone I have played it with loves it.  Easy to learn, hard to master.  A bit of luck, but it's so fun I still have to give it a solid 10.

Of all the games I own this easily gets the most play.

RATING: 6
Fun.  Not sure if it is an engine building game or not.  Sometimes it seems best to just grab jewels and see what comes rather than try to start some over-arching strategy.  Best feature perhaps is it's quick play.  If you do poorly, just play again.

update: downgraded to 6. Just too much of an efficiency race that isn't especially fun anymore.

RATING: 9
After 13 plays I am liking this more and more, and steadily improving my strategy. It is dependent on the luck of the cards, but enough changes that it's always possible to either get some chips or pick up a cheap card. The game feels balanced and scales well from 2-4 players. I like it a lot and keep wanting to play it more. I originally rated it an 8 but upgraded it to a 9.

[2016 February 26; 15 plays; 5/10]
The game has an advertised playtime of thirty minutes, but I've found it more common to take forty-five to sixty minutes with new players ... and that's just too long for such a simple game.

In such a random, strategically shallow game, I'd at least like the ability to fluently hold conversation, but the game is just complex and "mathy" enough, that it requires a lot of attention to properly count which resources you have, need, and would like to spend.

I may rate this game a 6 or even 7/10 if I was asked after a few plays, but now, my opinion is that this is a very average game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good family game and awesome components. You have a very good balance between the tactical choices with the cheap cards, and the strategical choices you make due to the more expensive cards and bonuses. Also, you get this Dominion feeling that you build up your power for a long time. Then, the game suddenly turns into a victory point fight at some point in the game. Depending on who you play with, it could be a little boring at the end, when people try to postpone the end by reserving cards other players need. It's best when all act on intuition.

I love the theme, art is ok, chips are wonderful.

But it is fun once or two a month, and played quickly.

A lovely engine-building game where you collect gems to make getting gems easier at the higher victory point levels. Very simple, but the puzzle is an interesting one to solve each game. The poker chips are a great addition.

RATING: 7.6
Splendor is a pretty fun engine-building game with enough depth to keep me interested, but simple rules that are easy to teach.  For a quick game, it's more 'satisfying' than many other games that play in a similar amount of time.  I do worry about replay value, but the randomized sets of available cards and multiple options for what to do on a turn should hopefully help with that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating has gone done on this game due to having to remove highest valued cards to discourage unbalanced strategy; i.e., you are more likely to win hoarding gems to purchase higher value cards before other players have time to build a successful engine. Contains translucent gems (except gold).

RATING: 5
I certainly understand the broad appeal of this game but have no idea why a board game geek would rate it highly. It's an extremely dry set collection game. Simply nothing compelling about it to me. 

The only useful function I can see this game having is serving as a simple gateway game below the likes of Catan or Ticket to Ride.

RATING: 6.5
Really interesting little set collection/tablaeu building game.
Gems come is 5 different colours and a wild colour and are used to but cards from the selection on board or one you 'reserved' earlier.

Cards have a free gem on them that you can spend each round and some have points upon them. First to 15 points wins.

Its not particularly strategic as it is dependent upon the gems available on your turn and what buildings are available but it is quite tactical as you can 'reserve' take to your hand cards which you know your opponent was about to be able to play.

I was initially concerned there would be a win more mechanic as the lower cost buildings are quick and easy to play and each card gives you a free gem a turn however this is not the case as the cost balance has been done very cleverly as whilst the free gems from previously claimed cards are needed to purchase the higher cost cards you also need a fistful of the correct colour gems.

Components are very nice and the poker chip gems are very good and have a good weight to them. There is a slight issue with the green/blue/black gems being very similar in colour and shape however the background pictures are different and so you can tell them apart.

Sold with Nobles promo in 2017.

Really enjoyed this. Played twice in succession, very fast to play. Really liked the progression and tension in timing of your actions. No direct inter-action but the obvious direction other players go in makes it clear if you can pick a card they were aiming for. So there is indirect play and you need to either keep your options open or try to hide your intentions. The balance of benefits was always interesting too. Nice artwork, although it's strictly an abstract.

+++

Played again today, as a 2p game, lost and then won. Still really enjoyed the game. With fewer chips out, it's still a contest to get the cards you want. There was more direct competition for cards and my opponent got into the 2nd row faster than me. I'm not quite reading the tactics yet, but really enjoying the challenge.

Not my cup of tea, but very good for what it is: minimalist engine-builder.

Played 5 times. Rating history 7|8|7|7|4
3p - 3
4p - 2

1st-4th plays: 7|8|7. June 2014: You think there is a theme? HA! No theme for you! But in the same fashion as Cribbage or Lost Cities, this game has a mesmerizing quality to it. The short play time seems to help these kinds of games. I wouldn't say I am looking forward to my next play, but when someone suggests it, I'll be itching to improve my play.

I ought to hate this game.

5th play: 4. Sep 2014: I was excited to play this again, having not played it since June, but 5 minutes into the game, I knew I'd never want to play this again. Decent little engine games, but I'd rather play bigger engine games, or lighter short games. Dull. 

I'd rather play:
...Agricola for an engine game
...Dominion for a short engine game
...Innovation for a 2p card game
...Meuterer for a 4p card game

I enjoy this game thoroughly.  Its a good amount of thinking and planning ahead a little bit (which you can do while your opponents are thinking about their move).

You spend gems to buy other gems, but the gems you buy can also be used to buy other gems - without being themselves spent.  The goal of the game is to basically snowball, and it pulls it off magnificently.

Nagyon egyszerű kis játék. Tokeneket viszel vagy lapot viszel a tokenekből, amik újabb instant tokeneket gyártanak. Ennek megfelelően nekem kicsit uncsi is volt.

Minden más eléggé láncszerűen működik. Hasonló játék, de legalább egy kicsit hangulatosabb az Építőmesterek. Azzal szívesebben játszom.

Ok, the box cover is pretty cool, which may explain the giant box, but blowing a chance to make a game that should have been easily portable makes me drop my rating at least a point. My first couple of plays of Splendor FTF didn't do much for me, but after playing a lot more on the app I can now see some of the appeal. On a day where I'm more interested in chatting with gaming friends than on focusing on a meatier game, I'd be fine with breaking this one out, as stretches of the game are often a bit of an autopilot experience anyway.

RATING: 5
A minimalist engine building/set collection game. While it may seem like there is a decent amount of guessing your opponents' intentions and blocking going on at first, it soon turns out that a lot of it is just for show. Grabbing a tile just before someone else would isn't actually very effective if it is immediately replaced by something even better (usually: cheaper) and that happens a lot more often than you would think.

In the end, turning up the right cards at the right moment is a lot more important than any deliberate player move, a deficit that is amplified by an engine building scheme that rewards quantity instead of quality.

I will give this game a few more chances, might even try to tweak the scoring to make it more competitive, right now it seems like there is no point in building your gem card stack though.

Das größte Plus von SPLENDOR ist die Großzügigkeit im Spielmaterial: dicke, fette, pfundschwere Chips, die jedem Ocean Eleven-Casino in Las Vegas zu Ehre reichen würden. Die Dinger liegen in der Hand wie Münzen aus dem Schatz der 40 Räuber. Das Klappern beim Stapeln ist ein nervöses Wohlgeräusch vom Pokertisch. Auch die Personenplättchen hätten mit dünnerer Pappe den gleichen Zweck erfüllt, aber auch hier gilt Prosperität. So 1a das Materialbewusstsein, so konventionell das Spiel selbst: mit den Chips, die verschiedene Arten von Edelsteinen verkörpern, bezahlt man Karten, die Dauer-Edelsteine oder Punkte bringen und wer zuerst 15 Punkte hat, gewinnt den Bazar. Das haben andere auch schon 1001x gemacht im Orient. In seinem solitären Charakter dürfte SPENDOR zu zweit am Besten kommen, weil am Taktischsten, weil man hier Chips blocken kann. Unter Berücksichtigung der Zielgruppe Familienmitglied steht SPLENDOR als gute, solide Dutzendware im Regal von Karstadt, den die attraktive, aber ahnungslose Verkaufsberaterin auch ohne Wissen von Brett- und Gesellschaftsspielen vorbehaltlos empfehlen kann. Ihre Telefonnummer wäre mir lieber.

While there is a tension between making plans and watching what other players are attempting to be able to preempt them by reserving cards, it comes down so fast to the luck of the draw being able to keep a color of gem away from a player or not (and as with many games of this preempting nature, there is a lot of left-right binding with which to contend).
Even ignoring the luck and downstream-malice, the biggest problem is a total lack of texture. Every color of development is of the exact same value with the exact same distribution and the exact same abilities. There is no unique strength or value to building particular developments or particular levels of developments, which makes players' tables basically the same and also makes the game feel the same every time it is played.

This is a good case study as to why some people would rather play board games than video games on occasion.  Splendor is so simple, and yet, when you look at your friend in the eye, holding these thick, metal core weighted chips, and then reserve that card you know he was going after.  Seeing him grimace at you.  It's not just the feel of the lovely components, the simplicity of the game, but it's that kind of euro game 'politely getting in everyones way' kind of conflict condensed into this thick gooey mass.  Splendor deserves to be in everyone's collection.

Fast game, great components. Feels a little like Dominion without all the shuffling, feels a little like Ticket to Ride with the choices of picking up gems or buying a card, but the theme/art is kind of dry and uninteresting. It can be fun, but not the great amazing game I keep hearing it is.

Update: After a few more plays, the lack of theme starts to catch up. Would rather play something more substantial. I guess I just don't care much for these distilled-mechanic games. Good as a filler, sure, but I'm not big on fillers in general.

Easy to teach, elegant set-collecting game. Quite dry. The interaction is mostly coincidental, or part of the luck of the draw. However, it is possible to deny cards to other players. The strategy element comes from choosing which set to work on, as the sets provide discounts on future sets and/or points, and some cards are more efficient than others, and lend themselves to getting better cards in the future.  It plays relatively quickly. Arguably it's over-produced, but there's a certain charm in the hefty chips. 

Edit: upped the rating after more plays. Very nicely balanced.

Nice set collection game with great components. Very tight gameplay with a screwage factor. I have kind of an annoyed/tense feeling when I play this because a lot resides on guessing what your opponent is trying to collect. Will they take the card you want?? Pretty good, but I'm not sure of it's longevity or desire to play when I have Biblios, or other faster options. I do kind of get an engine-building feel out of it.

I must say Splendor really lived up to its fame of "fast and simple" game, and I am surprised it did not win the Spiel des Jahres.

The tension of the game is all about when to stop building your engine and start gathering points. 

The feeling is surprisingly similar to dominion, although washed down in complexity, which of course leaves no space for any particular depth in the game.

Nonetheless, it's a fun game and an excellent one to introduce newish gamers to.

I've only played it once, 2 player, but it just didn't feel like I had any interesting choices or meaningful interactions. You always just either buy the cheapest thing you can afford while working towards a noble or take gems so you can do that next turn. The only real choice is when to reserve a card and that is never a must with 2 players.

I realise that it's a light, quick game and I shouldn't take it too seriously, but why should I play it if it's not fulfilling?

2 player variant:
In an attempt to keep our games closer to the feel of 3 & 4 player games, we’ve been using a 2 player variant(suggested in the games forum https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/17132785#17132785 that removes half of the level one cards.
In 2 player games, there tends to be an abundance of level one gem cards. Players tableaus turn into a frantic back and forth of - I take a card - You take card - I take card - etc.  Having an excess of Level 1 cards in play diminishes the chips value much too quickly from the game.  The game often turns into a race for the nobles with victory going to the player that gets 2 of the 3 first.

Simply remove half of the level one gem cards by dividing them into two equal cost/valued sets. This assures an even split of colors and creates two “half level one gem decks” that can be used for consecutive games.

Taking out half of the level one cards with 2 players gives a similar feel to a 3 or 4 player game by bringing back the risk that the cards may/will run out part way the through the game. The reduction of the level one cards ensures that the chips are in demand throughout the game.  As a result, the level 2 and 3 cards are purchased more often as well as an added attention for the need to reserve cards. 

YMMV; but also suggest increasing to 20 victory points instead of 15 for 2 player games.

This game is really good.  In under 5 minutes you can explain it and be playing it.  Sometimes, that's just important, and some people are only going to play a game where that is the case.

I've played 3 player, 2 player, and 4 player.  All games were tight, and moved quickly.

I haven't played enough to see a clear strategy as others seem to claim and refute.  It's certainly tactical vs strategic.  I can see this game popping out in a variety of groups and looking forward to getting it on the table a bunch coming up here. 

The components are great, and I think really help out a lot - you sort of just want to play with the poker chips.  In terms of value....I don't know.  I picked it up for 20 on a sale - I think for 30, it feels a little light.  But hey, if you like the game, it probably doesn't matter.

Quick game that offers a lot to potentially think about, so first impressions are that it could be abit AP inducing....this hasn't been a problem for us so far but might be  worth considering with AP prone players/with 4 players. Nice thinky game that gives us a fair bit in relation to its game time/ foot print and look forward to discovering it in more depth.
June 16; rating reviewed (9 down to 7) as just not got this to the table in a while and the lack of theme does stop me pulling it out with new people as although it enjoyable - it's just a dry engine builder and we have more interesting ones for that.

As I become a bit more of an experienced hobby gamer, my perspective on Splendor is changing. I keep it in the collection because its a fun diversion and especially good to play with non-hobby gamers. They love it! But for seasoned gamers, the game is probably just a bit too simple. What I don't like about the game is that it's fun for the first 15 or so moves when you have to collect chips to satisfy the card prerequisites. But if you play the game correctly, there is a tipping point where all you do is simply pull cards from the rows where you have already satisfied the demand through earlier moves. That's not fun. And at that point in the game it simply becomes a race to the finish and/or highly luck dependent as to what colors come off the stack and whether or not those are gems that you need for various mixes.

But somebody who likes learning new games doesn't have too much reason to play this 5 times.

Simple engine-building.  Easy to teach and learn, with nice presentation and components.

Take a resource chip or two, spend to buy a card.  Use said card plus more resource chips to buy more cards that give points and more resources...  repeat until target point threshold has been reached by one player.

This game did not excite me at all. Has minimal interaction, none of which is "direct", which lands it outside of my particular tastes. The amount of praise that it often receives just doesn't align with my opinions of it.  I don't find that it has any real "meat" and after half a dozen or so plays, I had no desire to play it again.  

Certainly not a bad game, as it's ease of understanding offers a nice introduction for some common mechanisms within the hobby. For this reason, it'll remain in my collection for a while longer.

RATING: 5
Very simple and abstract card game. You get gems to buy cards that provide permanent gems, and over time you increase your ability to buy more expensive and valuable cards. There is also some set collection that may give you bonus points in the form of nobles' tiles.

It works, but there really isn't much to the simplistic gameplay. My only game had a strange arc, very slow for the most part and then suddenly moving fast to the end, but it seems that it's very dependent on how the cards come out. There is obviously a significant amount of randomness, aggravated by the lack of any perceivable logic in the cost of different cards in the same deck. It may be a good fit for non-gamers and I wouldn't mind to play it once in a while, but it left me with the general impression that it isn't more than an oversized, overpriced, overlong (and seriously overhyped) filler.

The art is pretty and the sturdy tokens are nice, but in a game about precious stones, it's a real shame that the publisher missed the obvious opportunity to include some beautiful plastic gems.

Drops in as an instant 10 I don't think this is the best game every made, but for me it is the best game that I can easily setup and play in 30 minutes or less. The amount of interesting dilemmas squeezed in to that tiny time frame are really a treat. Also, props to the publisher for using nice thick tokens. They are a joy to handle and could have easily cheaped out and used cardboard. One of my criteria for rating a game is how much will it hit the table, and how many different types of people can I play it with. This is basically anytime and almost anyone. Big, big thumbs up.

After 20 plays it holds up. The design of the game lends itself to very close contests. I recently played Arboretum and I actually like it better for a short game, but it is really best at 2 when you go back and forth against one opponent. Therefore this is still my favorite 30 or less game since it plays equally well with any available count.

Muy practico y facil euro/filler, mas tirando a abstracto/probabilistico que otra cosa. 

Consiste en hacer 15 puntos de victoria, comprando cartas, que se compran utilizando unas fichas (gemas) que constituyen un fondo comun para todos los jugadores. 

poco azar, bastante interaccion, da mucho pie a jugar planificadamente en base a probabilidades previsibles, pero al mismo tiempo muy facil de jugar.

This is a game where the components certainly help the rating for me. The feel of the gem chips makes a big difference for me, as oppose to playing with cardboard tokens in their place. Kind of like a miniatures type game gets that extra kick when playing minis instead of tokens.

Nice little engine-building game. Works also with non-gamers. Love the components! (28.3.2016)

I still like Splendor. With gamers it turns into a thinky and deep game with difficult decisions turn after turn. It rewards skill which has affected negatively my win %. It just shows there's more than meets the eye and room for improvement! I'm eager to try the expansion. (15.9.17)

so quick and easy to play and learn and everyone loves it so far. Seems to have some decisions to make in terms of do I take this card becasue I want it or that card because it will hamper the opponent. Often find that one game isn't enough and we get that again, again feeling from it.

This game caught my interest from the first play.  After 7 games (and 6 losses), I think it is going to be one of my favorites for a while.  The "theme" doesn't matter, but that doesn't matter to me, as I'm just fine with the game mechanics (maximize turns and resources, while keeping an eye out for the occasional chance where the best move is to minimize your opponent's turn).

I had a hard time getting my head around how to win this game for a long time. I think it's deeper than many people give it credit for, despite having a definite high degree of randomness. This is a great gateway game for those reasons. One of the first things I'd pull out when introducing someone new to the wonderful world of board games. Even so, there are many other games I'd rather play if I had my druthers.

This is a relatively quick game.  It has lots of little decisions that make it slow to start, but then when it gets rolling, people start picking up cards for free or for 1 good, and the game can end in a big rush.

It reminds me of one of the things I dislike about Alhambra -- you plan to buy a card and save goods accordingly, but then the player to your left gets the card, and a new card shows up that you could also buy, but the next player picks that one up, and so on.  So there's a lot of luck-of-the-draw that seems unfair to me.  But I guess that's to be expected for a quick filler game like this.

It's very important to pay attention to what Nobles are available to be won, since it's a race to get them.  You could focus on getting cards with colours that could be used for more than one of those nobles.  For example, if there is a noble to be won for having 3 white, 3 blue, and 3 red, and another to be won for having 3 white, 3 blue, and 3 green, it would be good to pick up 3 white and 3 blue!

It might be a good idea to pick a couple of easy cards from the face-down pile at the beginning, so that you have a chance to go for something that nobody else knows about, and pick up a couple of gold coins (wildcards) as a side benefit.

Short on time but want a game that offers accessibility, tight gameplay, and plenty of choices? This is the one. My friends and I constantly throw down on Splendor and I have yet to get bored of it. The first player definitely has an advantage at the start of the game, but that's my only gripe (aside from the evil inlay that spews chips everywhere). I count it as a classic.

Abstract, stripped-down engine builder.  Pretty much MPS other than accidental blocking.  The strategy just seemed so painfully straightforward.  That being said, there is a good deal of short-to-medium term planning with satisfying rewards, which makes the experience of playing enjoyable enough considering the playtime.  I may play this again but won't feel like I'm missing out if I never do.

It's a perfect game. First of all: it's elegant and easy to get into: The theme is pleasing, but barely there, but it's not needed anyway: the abstract skill-rewarding gameplay stands on its own. The player interaction is indirect but, especially with more experienced players, stronger than it appears at first glance.

First I found it too streamlined and mechanic that it didn't excite me at all. After more plays, a deeper dive into the strategy, and my first wins, I realize that Splendor may be *the* benchmark for this kind of game: streamlined light/mid-weight filler that appeals to a *wide* audience and comes with great components.  My early verdict (in 2014) was: “Next year, next perfect game.” — now, mid-2016, I still don't see any game taking Splendor's place.

This game was the surprise of the game night. I didn't expect a lot from this one, however after playing it i changed my mind. The game is an abstract strategy game without a strong theme so what is insteresting about it? Well it is kinda an engine building game just like Fleet but in this one you can take the limited resourced before your opponents manage to take them. It has one of the easiest rules but the strategy is deeper than it first appears. After that i no longer wonder why this game is so popular. The playtime is around 40 minutes.

Pros / Cons:
-This game gives you an opportunity to kick ouf your opponents from the valuable resources to force them to buy from a more expensive one (golden).
-The rules are quite simple yet the strategy is deeper than that.

-Well it is hard to say bad about it, but im not sure if it has enough replayability.

RATING: 7
Very good game, looks fantastic if a bit repetitive. Same art work is recycled on many cards. Doesn't take away the fact though that art itself looks good and fits the theme really well. Components are high quality and I appreciate that all the gems are weighty pieces of metal and plastic, giving more authentic feel of touching something with value, instead of doing that part just with cards (which would have been even easier but a lot more boring decision). Game is very simple, on your turn there's only a few things that you can do. Victory conditions are very clear too. In a very slight way this is like building an engine (even though this is not officially an engine-building game at all), because you have to build yourself a bonus-system that you can utilize in order to start collecting victory points as soon and efficiently as possible. This is once again one of those games that is easy to recommend as a gateway game for basically anyone who's even remotely interested about boardgames. It won't offer anything too extensive and for hobbyists it is something more casual and filler-like. Still, all said and done, as a family game or for more casual gaming, it's a perfect choice. Please do keep in mind that with Cities of Splendor you can considerably improve the experience. Must have for anyone who keep playing Splendor on regular basis.

Splendor comes recommended from many sources: simple enough to be a family game, involved enough for gamers to come back to.

Players take turns acquiring gems from a limited shared stock, or buying things with those gems that offer more gems or prestige, the VP currency of the game.

I can see there's a lot going on, and that it will be fun to find out more with this game.

6 year old loves it.  Am I the only one playing real games with small children?  I'll take it over shoots and ladders any day of the week.

It makes it to the table often enough as a warm up or time killer as well.  Plays reasonably 2 player.

When I originally watched a playthrough video of Splendor, I immediately thought it was a winner. My friend on the other hand, thought it was the most boring Euro-type game he had ever seen. Then we played it and he was won over. Splendor has the TtR appeal in complexity and challenge. While I eventually see a mechanically identical, but more complex game replacing Splendor, for now it sees a lot of play time.

Somehow this game manages to get my heart racing as I get closer and closer to victory.  It's so simple and yet I find myself on the edge of my seat hoping I'll be able to get the card I need in time to win.  It's quick and easy and excellent.

RATING: 7
First off, the game is fun for what it is. A 20-30 minute soulless, themeless, romp with friends. I give this game a lot of garbage, but it is indeed a good solid game. To me, I consider it too-light, but my gaming group really loves it, hence why I keep it, and is also very easy to teach and can be played really quick, which is probably the main draw this game has. 

Overall, an good game at best. If you're looking for theme, look elsewhere. At a $25 price point, I'd be less critical, but at $40 I will recommend you purchase online instead of locally. Hopefully Cities of Splendor(expansion) add some more variety and life to this game

This is entertaining, but I find it to be lacking any serious depth.  There are other quick games I'd rather play and there are other games with similar mechanics that provide the depth.  It can be competitive but I feel it's too easy to figure out, so it becomes a race to see who gets what they need and dependent on player position.

This game originally started much higher for me but as time has passed my taste in games has evolved and leaned more towards complex euros with crunchy decisions.

Meh... it's technically a game.

In all seriousness, Splendor is a perfectly serviceable board game. That is to say, it has rules and game components that players use to achieve victory. Other than that, it's extremely bland. The theme is ridiculously unimaginative and not necessary to the game at all. You basically compete in a race to see who can make the best trades in the least amount of time. Splendor has all the functionality of a seedy, bad-part-of-town flea market with none of the excitement or danger.

A big hit with both my wife and me. We enjoy the flow of the game, the planning (especially how you can easily upset the other's plans) and how quick it plays while still giving you the feeling of having accomplished something at game's end.

Splendor is very fun and I think it can be a terrific gateway game.  It is simple enough to teach non-gamers, yet there are different legitimate strategies you can try to win.  The game plays very fast ~30 mins and I usually want to play it again immediately after finishing a game.  There is very limited player interaction in this game: opponents can buy cards that you want or need and thwart your plans.  It is a somewhat dry game, meager in the theme department, but the gameplay is superb.

RATING: 9
Enjoyable with great artwork. Not too much confrontation with other players, unless someone choses to go in for a card someone was saving for. Play goes around the table pretty quick, so nobody has to sit around too much. One of my wife's favorites.

RATING: 3
This game was quite boring. It plays more like an addictive smartphone app than a board game. It's simply all about collecting gems so you can collect more gems. I especially didn't enjoy how little interaction there was between players. It's a race to the top but there's rarely a necessity to speak to each other, unless you just need someone to hand you a token or a card!

A neat set collection game that allows a few different strategies to max out point collection (the strategy that works seems to be to bypass the zero point gem cards and just collect coins until you can get the big card you want).  Light mind grinder with some AP when it comes to working out maximum points and cards to gather for augmenting gem values.  Nice and simple, easy to understand and teach, plays quickly.

RATING: 8
A great game, all-around. Splendor is an engine-building game. It's thin on theme, but rich in gameplay. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master. The game components are excellent-quality. The turns are short. Everyone at the table stays involved as the board and resources keep changing. The games are short enough that you're likely to play more than one game in a sitting. I foresee this being a regular at the gaming table.

Get this: If you like Dominion. If you like engine-building games (like Dominion). If you like your strategy games with a bit of luck. If you're looking to a "gateway game" other than Ticket to Ride.

Avoid this: If you hate strategy games. If you only like games with complex rules. If you play games for their themes (you could paste any number of themes onto this game and it wouldn't matter).

Played tournament with Anna, Bryan and Brandon, 12/14/17.  Anna lost by one turn in her first round game and I lost similarly.  Bryan won his game, but declined to move on and asked me to stand in for him.  I won my semi-final game with 17 points on the last turn, earning a noble.  I was set to play Joel Neria head to head in the final, but he had to leave so we split the title.

I can occasionally be convinced to play a two player game, but the game is [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1629901/analyzing-splendor-strategies-7000-game-plays]fundamentally flawed[/url] and needs to be re-balanced to make the Noble strategy viable to increase tension. A possible fix is to make all cards worth 1 less point, and to make nobles worth at least 1 more point.

With three or four players the game is too random, meaning chance will dictate the winner more often than is acceptable to me.

Bokkensprong 17/10/14, met Roy. Kort, vlot spelletje met vrij eenvoudige regels. Doel: 15 punten halen door voldoende kaarten te kopen (sommige zijn punten waard, andere niet). Kaarten worden betaald met edelstenen, meer gekochte kaarten zijn ook edelstenen waard. Per beurt kies je één van vier mogelijke acties: 1) drie verschillende kleuren (edelstenen op pokerfiches) nemen; 2) twee edelstenen van dezelfde kleur nemen (mag enkel als er daarvan vier beschikbaar zijn); 3) een kaart reserveren (je neemt ze op hand en krijgt een gele jokerfiche erbij); 4) een kaart kopen. Best leuk, maar de te volgen strategie is niet zo helder de eerste keer.

Splendor is a set collection game where players collect gems and exchange them for resources that subsequently grant the player permanently available gems that count towards the exchange requirements of additional resources.  As a player accumulates permanent resources, he or she can better afford new, more valuable resources.  This mechanism results in a thrilling snowball effect.  

I've found that I pay very little attention to my opponents progress, so I wish that the game encouraged a bit more player interaction.  Otherwise, Splendor is an simple and enjoyable "filler" game.  The components are top notch.

Really fun little filler engine builder/race game. It distills the genre to it's bare bones and so if you like a lot of fluff you won't care for this one. But somehow it reminded me a good amount of Alhambra (every turn you can take some currency or exchange some currency for the things that score) but it feels more controllable and less random. And also (it at least feels like) it plays a lot faster, since it really is a race. Great as an introduction to Euros or as a filler that's still a serious game.

Believe the hype! This game is great! The short learn/teach time and play time vs the amount of strategy and fun is incredible. My father, who couldn't even learn Bohnanza or Dixit, somehow learned and enjoyed this one. He even asked for a second play immediately following the first! Is Splendor innovative though? I don't think so. To me, it feels like a Knizia title (and I mean that in a good way) that could have come out many years ago. Maybe that's why it's so accessible - it feels like a familiar classic.

A race type game with style. Very well made components.  Fun and light.  Stands up to repeated play.  I appreciate the effort that went into the design but the theme does feel "pasted" on.

Big discussion about pasted on themes but still like the mechanics in this game. Played three with Brian, won two.  I also got lucky.  We both noticed how the game speeds up somewhere in the fourth or fifth round. 

Played a very good game last night.  I made the mistake of not tracking my opponent's stockpile which would have been a tipoff of his strategy and averted a huge comeback victory for him. Do not treat this game like solitaire. It has more depth than that for sure. 

Played several online games.  A few bugs that I'm sure will be fixed.  But' gameplay was smooth and pace was excellent.  Not handling the chips has some getting used to but overall an excellent gaming experience.

RATING: 7
Splendor is a game that has grown on me. My initial impressions weren't great as I wondered what was so novel about its engine building that seemed to end before it could begin to really allow powerful moves. The more I played it, the more I found that it is about building the leanest engine possible, not the most powerful.

It has some issues - namely in the randomness department, especially with more than two players. The trade-off is that is makes a great gateway game as it is simple to explain and gives even first-timers an outside shot of winning.

After some consideration, it's earned a spot in my collection thanks to its simplicity and intricate challenge even for veteran players.

Seems like I was a little late to the game, but it's not like this was ancient when I first played it.  I can see how it could make such a splash when it first came out.  I can also see how it might wind up being a flash in the pan.  Time will tell.  Update: I won my second play.  I'm not sure why.  If I ever figure it out, I might also figure out whether or not I like this game. Update2: Upgraded it to a 7 to put it above the riff-raff. It's fine. I'll probably play if you want.

I'm not a huge fan of this game but my wife is.

Every turn is very significant, one mistake can totally wreck the game.

RNG plays a very small role (sometimes you buy a card and the card that replaces it is perfect for your opponent)

You can hate on your opponent's strategy by reserving a card they are working toward.

Eh, not my cup of tea but I recognize that it's a good game.

Very good game, well-balanced combination of luck and strategy. I find it's perfect to play when in between more intense games. It's usually pretty quick to play, if you're with the right people. 3 is the perfect number- with 4 too much changes from one turn to the next, it becomes a little too luck-based, with 2 it's good but not as interactive.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2014)

I wasn’t expecting a very good game, so I wasn’t very disappointed, however I can say I found the game to be very light so I will sell it as soon as I can. I can see Splendor as a good game to bring new people into our hobby, but I don’t have any desire to play it again. It is not a bad game, it even has some (minor) interesting decisions, but as I find the game to be obvious, I think the luck of the draw can play a significant role. I could be mistaken as I only played it twice. The rules can be explained under two minutes.

The game IS gorgeous and the chips are heavy and feel great (I think this is its main appeal). The art is also of good quality. The game insert is useless as the game get disorganized very easy. 

Bottom line, an ok game for families or new gamers. It is very light for me so I won’t waste any more of my play time with it. I’m surprised it is ranked so high here on the geek, as of today it is 148. I suspect that if I play it again the rating will continue to go down.

When someone says "here's a new collect resources to buy points game!" I die a little inside and either find an excuse and leave or resign myself to a hour or two of tedium as it seems I've been playing variations on this well-worn theme for 20 years now.

However, against expectations this one felt fresh and fun. 

We may have read something wrong, but 15 points seemed a low total to play to - none of us got anywhere near taking the bonus tiles. It certainly didn't outstay its welcome (which was good, as I find the long resource/points optimisers particularly tedious), indeed it felt like it finished just as we were starting the midgame.

Simple rules, and good looking too.

Such a great drafting game with excellent components. Extremely simple set of rules and curb appeal make this a stellar gateway game.

This is AMAZING.  It's been years since I've been so excited about a game.  It teaches in two minutes, it plays quickly and smoothly, it's interactive without being vicious, and there are multiple paths to victory.  It's elegant, has good quality components, etc etc etc.  It's just really, really fun to play.

It seems odd that I would like this game as much as I do-- my typical top-10 fare are long civilization or development games (Agricola, Clash of Cultures, Mage Knight).  But this simple little "gem" might be better than the lot.

(Update) After a while with this game, lack of theme is stopping me from coming back with the same enthusiasm, though I would never turn down a game.

Splendor is a gem of a game. Lu and I love it. On the surface, Splendor appears to be a simple card game. On your turn you can do one of four actions. Of those four, two will acquire you chips, and the other two gain you cards and the coveted wild chip.

Splendor plays quickly, but in a agonizing way. It’s fun, however the simplicity is a veneer that covers the hidden complexity and depth that only repeated plays start to chip away at. A game that by all accounts defines the term “filler game”, but in reality hides a complex economic game under it’s many layers.

Don’t let Splendor’s short rule book, and simple mechanisms lull you into a belief that this is a casual game. This game will have you quietly mulling over what to do from turn to turn, while carefully tracking your opponents card tableau trying to determine exactly how many turns you have left to amass the greatest fortune.

I recommend this game for any collection. Splendor is fun, small, easy to teach, hard to master, and has that certain quality of addictiveness that is oh so hard to capture in a game.

I feel as though the game would be very similar in strategy almost every time... as the people are more traps than anything and really it's just a question of resources between the early and mid game to get you to your goal... Also I feel it's very group dependent.

While Splendor is certainly not a deep game, there is more here than meets the eye. The decisions can sometimes feel scripted, but it is satisfying to establish your engine and build up to the higher cards. An enjoyable title from the lighter end of the spectrum.

Kind of just okay for me. It's a good solitaire game I think.. when playing with others it just feels like I'm playing a game by myself which is the one thing I don't like about this game.

Edit - I've played this quite a few times now and actually really enjoy it. Still feels like a solitaire game but I appreciate it for what it is.

Perhaps a more refined version of the game Bazaar. Bazaar is an old game, but if was such a brain burner. This game is more stylish and easier to digest. Looks like the new Century: Spice Roads is a combination of Splendor and more elements from Bazaar.

RATING: 8.5
Using coins as currency, buy cards that add to your currency pool... and start leading to victory points on the cards and with the nobles that respond to your pool of card-based permanent currencies. The game has a slow start but builds up quickly and leads to some strategy over what you take to stop someone from getting it -- and, as a result, the level of fun and intensity increases as well too.

BIG PLUS: increasing draw for interaction and strategy
MINUS: the theme of medieval nobles really doesn't apply to the game (you could go without it)

Played mainly with non gamers. 2 player and 3 player. Yet to try with 4 players which I think will be more chaotic and will trigger more reserving of cards. Non gamers liked it, I don't think the chips made much difference with those I played with because they wouldn't have been used to having gems as cardboard chits or cards instead. One said that players didn't have to think very hard which was good for a quick game and straightaway wanted to buy a copy of the game. I will keep it in my collection for introducing friends to games, and as a quick game after a brain burning one.

Picked this up after a play at a friend's game group. I thought about it for weeks afterwards, but it was out of stock. Mine just arrived and I've played it 3 times now in a couple days. Played with my "non-gamers" gaming group and they all enjoyed as well as with my 8-year old daughter (who liked it). Let's see if the "newness" wears off on this one, but for the time being I'm really enjoying play.

RATING: 7
A game of silent calculation. In fact, it is eerie how quiet it gets when playing this game. The rules and objectives are simple, so there is nothing game-related to discuss, and it does take concentration to calculate what you should do.

It is a good game for what it is. But this is simply a quality, but silent, card-drafting and set-building game. If that sounds like your kind of thing, you'll love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A resource management game with a surprising richness for how simple the components are. The directions seem complicated at first blush, but there are very few mechanics to teach. It sets up and learns quickly.

I find that this game is a quiet experience. It can be tense, especially if you defensively take a card or a token when you catch on to someone else's strategy, but I generally find that Splendor plays are lower key. A good one for a game night with lower attendance numbers, and/or a mellower crowd.

I like to start typical game nights with the louder, more interactive games, but games like this are good for near the end of the night, when the potluck table is picked over and food comas are beginning to set in.

Like it a lot, but really dislike the clunky end game triggering where some players can get a lucky flip/draw and steal the game. Wish there was some sort of advantage up front for players based on later turn orders instead of giving all other players an extra turn at the end of the game. Or maybe just give the guy that finishes the game another turn as well? Is that in the rules? If not, it should be.

You use coins to buy cards that have a gem (or coin) value and some of which give points. The coin value can be used with coins to buy cards. The gems are used to buy tiles that give points. The first to 15 points wins. This is fairly light, but is a fun filler.

I really enjoyed this game for a while, before I discovered the big number chasing strategy. We tried to variant / house-rule it away but it bothers me that such a simple strategy is so powerful, and so hard to prevent. The theme is also quite dry (i.e., not there at all) which makes it suffer at the table. Those chips though, wow.

We have since sold our copy.

This is my go to gateway game. It is simple enough for non-gamers to grasp and yet complex enough to hold my interest. I love how it starts slowly but then each player can branch out for different strategies.

My only real complaint with the game is its slight first player advantage. Yes, every player gets the same number of turns, but the first player has more exposure to the noble tiles. Yet even still, a really solid game.

Just about everyone I've taught this game to has enjoyed it, probably because everyone likes building an engine. Splendor strips the engine building game down to a bare minimum. This makes it easy to teach and learn. It also has a pretty high amount of luck (mainly in turn order and in which cards are flipped), but the game plays quickly enough that it is not bothersome, and it's fun to have everyone usually on the brink of winning when the game pulls to a stop.

The main thing preventing Splendor from being a 9 is what seems to be a lack of variability, and thus probably not a very long shelf life.

Only have a few plays of this under my belt. Feels a bit long for what it is, particularly with folks who try to calculate out everything. Also playing with good players seems to feel like there's really only one or two "paths". Some space I'd like to explore in the game, but really could be done against some AI or perhaps even just doing some analysis...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A game with multiple paths to victory, but only one of those paths is the right one.  There are 2 problems with this game: 
1) There is little interaction because everyone is quiet while they are concentrating. 
2) There is a dominant winning strategy in this game that makes any other strategy seem like playing the sucker bets in craps. 

After many, many games of this.  The balance issues reared their ugly head.  The winning strategy is to go for the high value point cards every time.  You can reserve the points you need to win, and no one can stop you, they can only hope to reach 15 points faster than you.  This works almost every time; the exception is when all but one player is playing this strategy and the remaining player is free to collect the nobles without interference and no need to block anyone.  Otherwise, it is very hard to win by going for nobles because it is almost impossible to both block someone and go for your noble cards at the same time.  A better balanced game would make both strategies - high value cards and nobles - viable every time during every game.

The gams is fascinating, because it is so simple. There are just a few rules, however plenty of decisions to make. You have to choose, which cards to save for and which cards to take into you hand so that others won't steel them from you. Do you need three different chips or two of the same sort? By the way, the opportunity to take two of the same occurs not that often. Finally, it is important to pay attention to what nobles are available. To sum up, it is not that easy to find the best way to victory.

Žaidimas žavi savo paprastumu. Taisyklių tikrai nedaug, tačiau sprendimų pakankamai. Kurioms kortelėms taupyti, o kurias pasiimti į ranką, kad kiti nenukniauktų. Ar imti tris skirtingus, ar du vienodus žetonus. Beje, du vienodus paimti ne taip dažnai ir pavyksta. Galiausiai, svarbu atkreipti dėmesį į tai, kokie didikai yra prieinami.

Belle découverte, un jeu avec règles simples et décisions intéressantes comme je les aime. L'interaction vient du fait qu'il faut surveiller les possibilités des autres pour leur subtiliser les cartes avant qu'ils ne le fasse. Un peu trop de cartes accumulées à mon goût (on a complètement vidé la pile 1, je ne sais pas si c'est fréquent). À la fin, nous avions tellement de cartes que le jeu se jouait presque tout seul (on pouvait aisément prendre des cartes gratuites ou presque). Thème absent, froid pour ceux qui ont besoin de se sentir un marchand, un entrepreneur, un architecte ou quoique ce soit - on fait seulement acheter des cartes sans signification. Pour ma part la simplicité, la mécanique, la qualités des décisions et la durée relativement courte font en sorte qu'il est définitivement à rejouer, avec un achat possible si concluant. 8/10.

Management of five different currencies on two levels. There's a variable form of currency with limited total quantity for you to have and you use this form to generate the permanent form of currency that isn't spent when you use it. The latter form also contains the main bunch of your points. You have to have an engine in the permanent form of currency to do well, but at the same time you shouldn't forget making points by acquiring more expensive and harder to get pieces of the permanent currency. There's also some neat outguessing and very nice components included. After several plays I've formed a stern opinion that if you focus on blue, white and big buildings and forget red, green, engine building and nobles you're likely going to do well.

Nice little engine building game, with a few different strategies you can go for in each game. It's quick, and is a great way to fill 30 minutes.

RATING: 4
Dry, bland, themeless, multiplayer solitaire at its worst.  Game has some good engine building elements, but ends just as soon as you ramp up to tier 3.  Does require skill and strategy to play, however too many choices are sub-optimal, sometimes unintuitively so.  For example, going for nobles is actually a poor play despite ostensibly being the POINT of the game.  You're better off reserving a top-tier card or two (if they have many common color requirements), then ramp up an engine solely to buy that(those) card(s).  If also you do this by focusing on tier 2 cards to build your engine as much as possible, you will leave players going for nobles in the dust.

This one is good gateway game and we always enjoy it when it hits the table.  We really like the game. I've gifted copies to people after we taught it to them and had several others go buy it. It's a fun game although I think the nobles are too important and effect the game too much.

Stary, dobry Splendor. Teraz już rzadko gramy, ale na początku był szał i graliśmy bardzo często. Nadal lubię tę grę - jest prosta, dobrze wykonana, właściwie nie ma ograniczeń wiekowych. Bardzo fajna i przyjemna, zarówno na rozgrywki we dwoje jak i więcej osób :)

K:
Sucha jak pieprz ale proste zasady i ładne wykonanie sprawiają, że można w nią zagrać w każdym gronie. Działa dobrze na 2, 3 i 4 osoby, w gronie osób starszych i młodszych, trwa około 30 minut wiec nie zdąży się znudzić. Nie raz zagraliśmy z rodzicami kilka partii pod rząd, co nie zdarzyło się w żadnej innej grze.

RATING: 6
This double-drafting game seemed fairly clever and entertaining. Players draft from limited resource pools, then use these to draft cards which may or may not be worth victory points but which always give card discounts and contribute to bonus objectives. A good overall strategy is to not have the same overall strategy as the player on your right, since this heavily influences your rate of freebies. Now, both of our games had runaway victories decided several rounds before we actually stopped playing: whoever comes out of the first age with a few more freebies and claims the first noble is most likely to get a second and seal the deal. Also the age three cards might as well not have existed. If this pattern holds it would put a dent in the game's elegance. Well-deserved poster child for ridiculously oversized boxes.

Nov/15. A surprising okay game. At first I snubbed my nose at it due to it's simplicity. Over the course of a year it has turned into one of my go to fillers. Because it is so easy to teach it can be played quickly by anyone, and regular gamer's will suggest it as a relaxing filler after a heavier game. I certainly didn't see that coming. Teresa liked it immediately from last years BGGcon.

RATING: 2
Having played it a few times I’d say that:
1.	The theme is abandoned as soon as you open the box, since it has no relationship with the mechanics.
2.	The aim is to snowball by buying stuff of identical worth until you can buy stuff that’s worth a bit more.
3.	The game consists of a pair of double steps: wait for your turn, pick up chips, wait for your turn, buy a card …
4.	… until you have so many cards that you don’t need to pick up chips any more and your turn now consists of wait for your turn, buy a card.
5.	Each player obsessively wants the same thing: the right card to build a set. If you share that ambition this gives the game the same addictive feel as solitaire. If you don't, you might get the same enjoyment from punching and sorting out the counters from a new box of Eclipse.   
6.	The main tactical decision you can make is to block another player. 
7.	You can make no other significant decisions.
8.	You can take no risks.
9.	There is no tension, only mild frustration (I wanted that card. Oh, well.). 
10.	The analysis, if you can be bothered, amounts to a dreary mathematical problem.
11.	The snowball effect and the luck of the draw determine who wins.
12. The end feels like oh, you (or I) won. Gosh. 
13.	The replayability is close to zero unless you like games of obsession governed by chance.
14.	It’s not so much a socially entertaining game as a tedious, obsessive slog. 
15. This is solitare in which you can be frustrated by other players.
16.	It has the merit of being over quickly.
17.	Perhaps not quickly enough.

OK, it is light and as far as theme "Feel the poker chips, they are great poker chips".  That said, I like it, it is quick, it takes up to four players and is a fun way to pass the time (unless you get all the green cards I want!)

RATING: 8
A design that epitomizes elegance.  A modicum of rules easily explained in a few minutes, yielding quite a bit of depth for a game that can be played in half an hour.  Set up and break down is also a breeze.  I think this is one of the best gateway games to come out since Ticket to Ride, but one I usually enjoy playing more.  I've had a lot of success introducing it to non-gamers.  Not for everyone, as it is a bit dry and the theme is clearly pasted on.  I call it a "chin stroker" since I find the game lends itself more to silent pondering than to table talk.  Also, can start to feel a bit samey after many plays, but I'm closing in on 50 plays and have yet to tire of it.

approximate number of plays (pre-2017):  50+

This is such a streamlined and brilliant game. The gameplay is smooth and fun. There is tension throughout the game. You are 1 chip away from a card and you sit there waiting nervously and someone takes it. It creates a lot of emotions and makes people feel stuff. There is an expansion coming but I feel the base game is enough that it doesn't need distractions. Absolutely recommend it to everyone. Such a wonderful game.

This has quickly become one of my favourite games and friends are always requesting it on game nights. It plays very smoothly for 2, 3 and 4 players and has a surprisingly amount of depth for a game that is very easy to teach new players. I love it for it's easy learning curve because I can use it as a gateway game but it still retains depth and challenge even after dozens of games. My group routinely plays 3 or 4 games of Splendor in a row before moving to another game. It's very well balanced and it's rare that any one player has a runaway victory.

If there is one criticism, the box is way to big for the size of the components, but I just put all the components in an Ultra Pro deck box and it travels amazingly well, I take this to the park all the time in the summer.

Fun engine-building game. Easy to teach and plays quickly. Usually too quickly actually, I almost always want the game to go a few more turns as my engine gets going. Probably also suffers from a runaway leader problem but the games are so short it hardly matters. I'm thinking of house-ruling that a player can only get one patron. This should extend the game a bit. We'll see. I'm always willing to play this one.

ルールの分かりやすい拡大再生産。やること単調で、淡々と欲しいカードを集めていくのであまり盛り上がらず、達成感がやや乏しい。相手の集めてるのを邪魔しながら、いかに少ない枚数でボーナス、三段目のカードを集められるかがポイント。
2018-2-16
三段目でなくとも二段目の高得点カードをターゲットに点数を稼ぐのもあり。いくつかのルートを確保しながら少ない投資で回収できるか。短時間で遊べてボードゲームした感じもあるので、評価７→８に変更。

Love the gem pieces and their weight - they feel sturdy. I enjoy the artwork as well. Maybe it's just me but I feel like I can never get any synergy with my strategies in the game. I also wish the theme came across more in the game, especially with the noble tiles. I'm not even entirely sure what you are doing in the game thematically. Mining gems for the nobles maybe? But it's a good, quick game that I enjoy playing.

I don't understand why this game is so popular. It's an okay game, but really just a race to 15 points. You can't do much of anything to stop another player from winning the game. There is pretty much zero player interaction and you have very little effect on the other players.

This is the best filler game for me and my wife. It is quick to play but yet has a great depth in terms of brain teasing. Although the theme and artwork of this game is romantic and beautiful, at the end, it is score racing game raising your heartbeat.

Christmas 2014!

Splendor is a beautiful lightweight filler, and a very good family game. Rated a 7 for gameplay alone, but adding another point because it will be so easy to get this one to the table. Top notch components, but I'm not sure why they put it in such a large box. The game bits only require a little more room than the bits for Biblios. Still, I'm happy to have this on the shelf, and looking forward to many more plays.

It's a filler game that doesn't feel like a filler AND it  plays well with only 2.  With 4 players, it is very important to plan for more than one option.  By the time it is your turn again, there is 90% chance that your choice play is no longer valid. Just saying,

I am amused by the number of people who love to criticize this game.  But I think this game is excellent.  It is easy to teach, is fun, and has a reasonable amount of strategic decisions.  It is a hit with my family, and I am happy to play it with adults.  Of course it is not Power Grid or Agricola or fill in whatever more sophisticated game you want to insert.  But it is not meant to be.

Completely unthematic. But a terrific, smooth game, good at any player count. Not too thinky. Never outstays its welcome. But the box is an egregious example of boxed air. Don't bother with the expansion which by all accounts is a dud. Anything beyond the base game will bloat it. Another favourite to play with my son.

Its a euro game. The theme doesn't matter at all.

The chips are cool - how nice and heavy they are. The artwork is nice - but it doesn't matter. Match the colors, score the points.

Played it twice with an overwhelming sense of "meh". 

Played it two more times with someone who got it more and had a lot more fun. Bumping it up to a 7. Hannah now calls it her favorite game.

Played it a bunch now and really impressed with the design. Bumping it up to an 8.

A quick abstract filler with chip-collecting and card development. The components are solid and the chips feel great. This game is elegant, but just falls flat for me.

Simple, streamlined engine builder with a dash of supply-demand mechanic.
The way you aquire gems adds a very nice layer of interaction (given the game's simplicity).

The true secret to Splendor's success though are the poker chips.

Splendor is amazing in that it's rulebook is one page, it's easy to learn, there's very little barrier to sitting down and playing. The Game moves fast, you can play a game in 45 minutes. The art is top notch, it's given so much thought thematically from mine to marketplace idea conveyed. And it's far more complex to master than it's simplicity implies.

It's not higher because if you're looking for a game with depth, that has gameplay, story and environments that grow throughout the course of the game, Splendor isn't going to provide that.

A great group game where you're competing with each other without actively targeting each other, instead "sabotaging" your opponents by buying resources out from under them. The gem tokens have a good weight and the cards are nice material rather than flimsy pasteboard. Everything fits nicely inside the box as well. The game as a whole is fairly easy to learn, with no guaranteed "win every time" strategy.

RATING: 6
Plusses: Dead simple design with zero mechanisms that are not absolutely needed. The whole thing has a "Sid Sackson meets 7 Wonders' resource system" -kind of a vibe. Art is bland but functional, component quality is excellent.

Minuses: Playing Splendor consists mostly of intensely & silently staring at the cards and gems, so it isn't a whole lot of fun. It's also best at fewer players (I prefer it with 2), as the more there are players, the less interaction there is as you can't really affect other players' plans. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.42
Highly abstract but extremely well-designed engine-building game that keeps you trying different strategic routes.

Weighty poker chips a very good idea - without them the game would likely fall dead thematically as an abstract cube-pusher.

Nice and quick.

RATING: 10
Play splendor once and you're hooked. The container box is ridiculously large, the poker pieces are too heavy to take it with you on holiday, and the rules could be explained more clearly.

But what an amazing game (you'd never expect that from Ravensburger, the logo equivalent to 70's housewives doing 1000 piece puzzles of a yacht scene).

In essence, splendor has a certain Soul, or call it personality, in it, that seems to come alive when you play. After 1 game everyone wants another, and another and so on. There is nothing like it. Great building system, great interaction, stuff to go for that makes a difference...

Play this game with gamers and it becomes very deep. Awesome, a keeper. 

A slight minor is the box size, mostly air, but easily fixed by cutting up the board.

Simple and fast to play - works very nicely and mechanically is very smooth. Maybe not best for the gamers, but for the family this could be a nice experience. We'll see... we'll see. I had a interesting weekend with this: first the finnish publisher was introducing this game for me, and then on the next day I had a chance to try it out in other place.
Updated: definitely best with three (fast) players. Sure: it's far from heavy game and there aren't that many different "levels", but I see a room for this kind of game as well. Production value is excellent. Splendor is one of these not-so-fun-game-to-be-played-but-thinky-experience.

RATING: N/A
Splendor is a fast-paced and addictive game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops—all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.

RATING: 5
One of the most overhyped games when it was released.

Too simple, zero innovation, completely pasted-on theme, boring artworks and an unnecessarily oversized box for storing the game's components.

It's nice as a gateway engine-building game for newcomers and yes, the game's poker chips (which are always mentioned when talking about this game) are indeed nice, but in the end, the game looks, feels and plays soulless to me.

It's a rather simple conversion game with nothing outstanding and some small components in a big box, but it plays fine. It's a good but not great game, on the same level as many non-classic simple Knizias, so its ratings are somewhat surprising for me, but yes, it's good, and just like many Knizias, it does better with repeated play. it has some addictive quality to it - for some reason whoever plays it wants to play it more. I don't get it but it's not really a problem for me either.

There's nothing that exciting or interesting with this filler game.  Best thing about Spendor is it's done in 15-20 minutes.

An abstract of converting gems (currency) to gem mines (cards that provide automatic currency), all for the purpose of gaining most victory points (mines with VP plus nobles worth VPs).  Not bad but nothing grand or exciting that sparks me to suggest playing it.  

Fundamentally, it's a race of who gets to 15+ VPs first and many times, it's won by whomever gets the most nobles with solid foundation of gem mines.

Clearly I really enjoy playing this game. I played it 23 times in one month. But what surprised me about Splendor is that I enjoyed my 23th game even more than the first couple of games. The game plays fast, you can get in a couple of games in one sitting. It's deep, strategic, but not obviously so making it an ideal gateway game. Everyone I played this with seemed to love it, especially my parents. Great game which I hope to play a lot more of.

Splendor is everything you have probably heard about it. It is very streamlined, it is very quick, and it is very easy to understand the rules and jump into the strategy. All that being said the game doesn't really have all that much that is compelling me to want to play the game. Nothing to make me want to stand up and say this is the game I would want to play in any situation. Splendor is like your toilet, its there and it serves a purpose, but no one would say they just love their toilet.

I think Splendor has forever earned a spot in my Top 10 List. It would take quite a few amazing games to bump it down far enough to put it at risk of ever being removed. The accessibility of this game is unrivaled. There is not a better gateway game that has ever been produced, because it appeals to all ages so well. Because of that, no single game may have done more for the gaming industry than Splendor. I think it has brought more people and families back into boardgaming than any other game in the past few years. The rules are simple, and very easy to learn in under 3 minutes of explanation. But the underlying strategy beneath the surface of these simple rules and mechanics is unbelievable. And I don't think many reviewers see that complexity hiding so inconspicuously beneath the welcome exterior of the beautiful and simple components.

Bella componentistica.
Si prendono gemme preziose per acquisire carte che potenzino il nostro motore commerciale consentendoci di prendere carte sempre piu costose e prestigiose.
E' un gioco di sviluppo senza particolari requisiti di sorta. Dura una ventina di minuti, gioco leggero e carino.
Scatola ESAGERATAMENTE sovradimensionata!

I was underwhelmed by this game: not so much thinking or strategy (the cards change fast, and are unpredictable), no theme.

I did like getting more and more powerful (in buying power).

I'm not sure what the fuss is all about: the game feels too simple/shallow for me (not that it is shallow, it is just two one-dimensional).

Splendor is a neat game with simple mechanics that make for for some deep decisions. The components are nice, especially the heavyish poker chip diamonds. However the theme seems a bit attached on and bland. I do like the game, but can't see myself playing it very often.

Very, very simple rules, makes this an excellent gateway game and for the more experienced gamer it has some good depth. Lotsa of fun!

This has easily been my most successful gateway game.:

I have one co-worker who played it, loved it. Bought it and then back in North Dakota, he played it with two other friends who subsequently bought it.
I played this with our marketing guy who doesn't particularly care for board games and he's told me twice how much he's liked it, as well as the salesman who really enjoyed it, too.
My brother-in-law and his wife (and my in-laws are NOT board gamers) played it and ended up buying it.

I've never had this kind of response to a game, and to me, this is more of a filler game, but people really just seem to grab on to it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Let me be clear: there's nothing wrong with Splendor. It works, it's fine, it does a thing. But that's as far as it goes, or even seems to aim for. It's another item on the list of recent games that seem to be happy eliciting a response of, "Yep, that's a game, all right." We played two games in pretty much silence, doing the things you do in the game until someone won. Occasionally someone called someone else a jerk for taking a card the former person wanted. There's nothing here aggressively bad enough to make one dislike it, nor captivating enough to demand further play. It seems designed specifically to sit on a shelf as part of a "collection". If it wins the prize it's up for, that will be the only way anyone will be thinking about it next year.

Although it's a simple engine builder, interesting decisions can present themselves with the timing of when to score points toward the end of the game. This is one my wife, who isn't a hardcore gamer, thoroughly enjoys and hence why it is still in the collection.

A great an succinct board game experience.
However your moves are all telegraphed, being first player is a strong advantage, extremely repetitious, great if you are looking for a simple experience.

It's also great if you like to master a game and become really good at it, it's easy to win, but isn't really compelling. I'd rate it better than Star/Hero Realms.

I bet the expansion would make this more palatable for me, but instead of adding this to my collection, I'd rather just play it when it's the only game that someone owns.

I really can not understand the hype around this game and the high ratings. I think so many people could have come up with this game but thinking it was so dull and cheap they threw that idea away. 

It's like a deckbuilding game engine but without deckbuilding ... It's like dominion (already non-thematic), take away the best aspect of dominion (deck building), add more type of coins and you get this residu. This is the pinnacle of non-creativity of boardgaming and it saddens me deeply so many people actually like it, it's a real demotivation for aspirant game designers like me. I don't want to make garbage, but apparantly garbage sells. 

The boredom is supported by the runaway nature of the 'design'. How a runaway leader game sells anno 2014 is beyond me. I guess poker chips is the way to design games today.

I rather play a 24h Monopoly marathon than one more game of this torture.

Great light strategy game.  Finally a game that is light and I can get anyone to play with me, but really feels like it's all up to player interaction and skill, and not luck!

There is the slight luck of which things come up when, but that really doesn't bother me at all and I have difficulty thinking it would bother others.

Really neat tight strategy and the nobles ensure a slightly different feel every time.

Can be a little bit samey, but so far at 12 plays I'm still enjoying it every time.

Very fun game for anyone to play. Good at 3 or 4 players, but I do not recommend it at 2 players. I've found that there is a strong advantage going to the first player with options to block resources or cards the other player needs. This maybe can be said at higher player counts to a degree, but at 2 players, the first player has more control on the flow of the game. Was a 9, now I'd say an 8 based on the game at 2 player count.

RATING: 6
A solid little set collection/engine building game. Nothing super special here and the theme is pasted on despite the good artwork, but very clean execution. Works pretty well as a family/gateway game. 

Besides chaining your cards to spend the fewest gems as possible, there is strategy in prioritizing colors that are required for a lot of  goals, hoarding gems until a card everyone shows up, and tactics of reserving cards you want and taking gems that are low in quantity. 

The cons of this game is the engine building snowballs easily, which can create runaway leader if someone just plays super poorly, and there isn't a good way to mill for cards you want, so sometimes you will have e.g. 4 cards completed with diamond bonuses but nothing to use it on.

-1 rating point due to the almost great insert. Sleeved cards don't fit! Only a few millimeters would have made it work...

-1 rating point due to cool gem discs... which scratch my table! About 1 in 5 have pointy bits out of the top - come on now.

-1 rating point due to the nobles ordering of gems being random! Should have been consistent, in the same order as the development cards. And also the poorly worded rules that would have been so easy to make clearer. Why would you have your high school buddy proof read?

Reminds most of Bazaar, but much less burny. You can kinda just screw around and still do okay. The end game is not entirely satisfying, but you do want to try again and see if you can make it work differently. Played a dozen games in the first week because of that.

Final rating to come after I perform surgery on the box insert to fit the sleeved cards in. Rate a 7 for now since nothing else is wrong with this game. ...left at 7 for this addictive game even after box surgery.

Easy to teach.  Quick to setup. And it offers just the right amount of interesting decisions. 

This is a brilliant game with a lot of nuances.  For example,  how quickly you expand into the higher tier cards can greatly change how well you perform.  I love how the game snowballs at the end as the game changes from a slow engine building game to a quick scramble for 15 points.  Very tense!

Update on 8/19/2015:  Still a good game but it's original "hotness" has worn off a bit.  I'll still play this but it's not something I am dying to get to the table.

A solid economic Euro that plays relatively fast.  It plays almost quickly enough to be filler.  You can gather gems on your turn or buy cards which provide virtual gems, to be used later. You can also take a card and gold for reserve.  There are three banks of cards with different values.  Higher values are harder to get out.  First player to 15 wins.  

The game is solid, but I think it gets played a lot due to its simplicity and speed not because it is a ground-breaking game.  Art and components are very good.  It is a family weight game.

Close to a great game.  Theme and graphic design (well, the chips are cool) are a big drawback, though.  Not sure there is enough player interaction either.

It doesn't seem to me there is as much to this title as people think there is. There's just nothing here of interest to me.

Ok, its a highly approachable game with incredible production quality.  Yes, the engine building mechanic is clean and some may enjoy the direct nature of it, unburdened with other mechanics.  But this game is dry and quite frankly, too long for its own good; it can lend itself to over-analysis with the wrong players.  Oh, and did I say it was dry?  This thing is boooorrrring.  There are many at least slightly more thematic games with only slightly more complex mechanics that do this job better.

Has some strategy, and noticing what other people have in gems can give you a hint as to what they're working towards, do you can attempt to foil them a bit.

My wife and I play this about 2-4 times a week since we got it maybe a year ago. Love it. Simple, satisfying and just the right amount of thinking to make an engaging fun game. There's some minor luck that players manage by controlling the flow of new gems. Very skilltesting once you know what you're doing. Easily most bang for buck I've gotten out of a game in my collection.

RATING: 8
Good filler game, or family game, a bit more depth that what first meet the eye. 
Very quick to learn and totally suitable for kids from 7 years (who seem to have a intuitive knack for the different strategies). 

Far more strategic with 2 than 4 players. Only compoenent of luck is what new card will be drawn to replace on bought or reserved. 
Still remains to see how much skill will matter...
Rated above 8 since the kids love it and it has sucha high gateway-factor that I might lure my wife to try a 2-player game ;).

Neat little card game that is very easy to learn, is easy to play and very accessible for every gamer. It plays well with 2 players too.

Contains Diamond and Gold AsmOPlay tokens.

RATING: 5
Not very innovative, reminds me a lot of Bazaar, but worse. Very little interaction, not thematic feel at all, but at least it's short. Our second game basically boiled down to hogging all the pieces, and jumping on the new ones as soon as someone had to spend some.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
It is a great game, well polished, great components (e.g., the heavy chips) with a good length (short enough) and good replayability.  Easy to teach, I can see this as a good introductory and gateway game.  I am not a fan of purely abstract games and therefore will not prefer it over other choices, but for what it is, it is excellent.  Also, it is somewhat MPS but has enough interaction, especially for a Euro.  Players tend to focus on their own tableaus but the tableaus are simple enough that after a while you pay attention to the drafting and denials and interact with other players.  One of the games that is good to have in one's collection, it fills a good niche and sometimes it is just the game you want to bring out.  Sustains repeated back to back plays.

My wife and I played this with another couple. The other couple own it and have been playing it 2 player for a while. They really enjoy it and wanted to see what we thought. I really hated it.

It being the first time I played it I didn't count on winning and I didn't but I didn't do very poorly. But I also knew I wasn't going to win 4 or 5 turns before the game ended. I realized my strategy wasn't going to work by then but didn't have enough time to pivot and go for a different one. I have a similar issue with 7 Wonders except I think there are some opportunities to come back in 7 Wonders.

In the end I came in a close 3rd and never want to play this game again.

A very enjoyable game, whether with 2, 3 or 4 players.  It's a great game for non gamers as it's easy to learn.  This game could also be a gateway game to other trading games.

There are deeper, more complex trading games out there, this one never fails to disappoint.  Though the rules are simple, the level of strategy can be quite deep and there are multiple tactics that can give you a victory.

Appropriate and teachable to young, old and non-gamers.  I see Splendor as a must have in any gamers collection.

Interesting simple (not very strategic) card game with money. 
This is all about creating a stone engine with cards, that let you buy more expensive cards, that will bring you the 15 points you need to win this game.

This game has some great play coins that on their own are worth the money. I had the feeling though, that you cannot do much wrong in this game. Whatever you do, it always brings you something and you are dependent on the cards that show up in the display when it's your turn. Still it's a fun game to play when your head is tired.

It takes a while to move on and get past the quality of the chips in this game. When you do the game is just as good.

A real thinky, planning and efficiency reward game set in the world of jewels. Where nobels are inexplicably drawn to you when you have enough gems (and I thought it was my personality that drew all the nobels to our door)! Needless to say I am not that great at it. My family do enjoy playing it, but not the youngest daughter and my son. They don't like it when you reserve a card they were planning to buy on there next go. A Mexican stand off with my youngest daughter resulted after I attempted (an attempt was as far as I got) to reserve a card she was planning to buy.

"I'm so angry I could just ... just ... rip this card in half!" she said as she held out the card between us, gripping it with a Chinese burn ready to tear it in two.

"Don't!" I yelled in blind panic having never faced anything like this before in gaming (I didn't ever think of Splendor as a legacy game). I held out my arms with palms pacifyingly upwards unsure what to do or how to react to this small bundle of terrifying wildness. "I ... I ... I don't actually have to reserve that card. I have just had a better idea."

"You have! Well that's good then" She said sitting back down.

She eventually relented and I now have a sturdily premium sleeved game of Splendor.

Great for the family but not so great with younger kids! Keeper.

RATING: 9
This is such a great game.

It's juuuust barely not an abstract, in a way that reminds me a lot of classic Knizia (Battle Line, Lost Cities, and the like), and everything under the hood is amazingly tight -- also just like a Knizia design.

Every game opens up a new layer of things to notice, learn from, react to, figure out, assess, plan around, build, play with, or try out. It walks and talks like an engine builder, but it doesn't have to be played that way.

I love the mix of strategy and tactics, which is right in my sweet spot for a shorter game like this one. (Short, but meaty!) You can go in with a plan, but it might change once you see what comes out in the initial spread. And everything that happens after that will require further adjustments, from "Oooh, that card is great!" to "Shit, he's going to get that noble first unless I..."

And all of that is wrapped up in one of the best inserts I've ever seen! With, to top it all off, amazing components. The cards are beautiful, but also clear from every angle and across the table. The choice of poker chips (nice heavy ones, too) was inspired.

I love this game. Instant classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After 5 plays (all 4P), this is a solid 8. Fast, straightforward, interesting, and great components (minus the box insert). All the complexity is in the actual game play - where it fits best!  For people who like lighter and quicker games I can see it being rated higher.  Still, it will see plenty of play when half hour is what we have.

Rating based on 2-4 players, but mostly 2.

Simple to teach and play, but there's a fair amount of depth to it for its length (which is nice and snappy). A good blend between making plans based on the high value cards and nobles available, but having to change those plans quickly depending on what cards are drawn.

Scales well between 2-4 players, but how you play the game will change dramatically depending on player count. I tend to use this as an introductory game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to teach, hard to be really good at, but that makes it good for new players.

Box Insert: 8/10, but close to breaking into the 9s. The main problem is that the wells spill too easily if the box gets turned upside down. As you are putting the game away everything should make you happy as it fits nicely and even had the games logo in the plastic, but an insert is more than just about putting things away, its about taking it back out next time you play. It should be good enough to make you want to take it back out and not regret the chore of sorting components you are about to endure.

While I enjoyed my first game, it soon became clear in our second game that the runaway leader / snowball effect meant that luck was a dominating factor.

Perhaps it was just very unlucky, but our second game resulted in one person getting 6 or 7 cards in a row early on (i.e. without having to pick up any tokens), most for free and the rest for one token. Prior to that lucky streak the game had been quite close (everybody had 1 point, and 5 +/- 1 development cards), but in the end that person reached 15 points while the other three of us each had 3 points (IIRC they had ~13 development cards while we each had ~7)!! Furthermore, the other three of us did try to gang up on that person for the last couple rounds (e.g. using gold coins in a vain attempt to block a winning move, discussing all possibilities openly), but it didn't matter... every card we took revealed another one they could grab outright, or could just reserve with a gold coin and claim for victory in the next round. Just to elaborate how bad this was: the leader could grab multiple cards in the third row, while none of us other three could buy even a single card in the second row (first row was empty at this time).

It's hard to explain just how bad this game was... two of the people involved will never play again (including the purchaser of the game!). I'm personally willing to play once more just to see if I'm missing anything (how in the world is this ranked 97?!?). I also re-read the rules to ensure we didn't miss anything (the rulebook is very clearly written, and the rules are simple to learn and understand). The only rules I hadn't known were a limit on 3 reserved (but not yet purchased) cards, and picking one noble if two are triggered at the same time; but neither of these had any relevance to the 'game' we'd just played.

Edit: Played some more. Still convinced this game is garbage. Pass.

I wish this game had theme, even pasted on theme. I really like the package. The components (including the insert) are fantastic, the gameplay is smooth and the playtime is short (30 minutes or so with 2), but it just feels sort of dry. I hope we become more attached to this game with more plays. As it stands, I feel that I'm only holding onto it because I like the components so much.

Update 9/1/14: After 2 more plays, I'm starting to enjoy this game a little more. I still don't understand the privilege cards (as they seemed completely tacked on), but I enjoy the engine building in this one.

The fact that this won the Golden Geek for the best game still baffles me. There's nothing really here that can't be found elsewhere. Seriously, this was picked over SW:IA and I think ranks 8th from the games that came out the same year.

Lowered to 6.02. The definition of a lukewarm game. Curious to play it with a set of competent players.

RATING: 6.5
A fine light, abstract strategy game that packs a lot of interesting decisions into a short play time. The tension between whether to build your economic engine or go straight for the win is there in most every game.

Still, the relatively repetitive game play combined with the lack of theme will usually cause serious gamers to burn out on this one sooner or later, as I did after a couple months.

Great as a gateway game, particularly for spouses.

After 4 plays, I can appreciate the design of this game a bit better, and have seen different strategies emerge depending on player count (in 4 player games, gold is more available than 3 player games). The sort of game which doesn't outstay its welcome, is readily accessible to new comers and is quite enjoyable overall.  Timing important as is blocking and keeping an eye on what one's opponents are doing.

Initial rating of 7:  Good but not great filler.  Can see why it would get alot of play, but it is pretty themeless.  Just about building an economy and set collection.  With some luck of the draw elements, and timing important for the chips.

Haven't been as drawn to this lately, which is unfortunate. It's probably going to fall even more out of favor now that OddVille is on the shelf. OddVille provides the same excitement of building up an engine (through the wild and wacky characters) and adds a much neater spacial element to it.

Still, this is a great game. If I had a group I was regularly playing with, the rating would likely bump up again.

Fun family game about making an engine helping you do more and more every turn. Nice graphics and great quality chips (resemble poker chips in weight and the general feel), makes you want to play the game just to hold them again and again.

Great intro game. People that aren't gamers seem to enjoy this a lot, and probably is a must-own game because of the niche it fills as an intro to gaming like Settlers of Catan.

I got this for my iPad, played a ton on Christmas Day and I don't know if I ever need to play it again. It's pure number crunching: dull, dull, dull. One kind of points turns into another kind of points turns into another kind of points.

I wouldn't turn down a game with the physical version, I've never played it and I understand the components are very nice to look at and touch. One game might be enough, though.

10/18/14 Played a three-player game in 35 minutes. 
The game's production values are high, its takes little time to teach/learn. Basically I'd call it a filler. There's no direct player interaction. The theme seems pasted on. For I can't fathom why if we are merchants why we just collect gems. We never sell them. The theme could have easily been something like collecting butterflies, which would have made more sense. And what are the "black" gems? I know of no black gems. That could have been easily rectified by using another (brighter) color of gem (like purple Amethyst, light blue Aquamarine, pink Rose Quartz, or yellowish/orange Topaz). Anyway, the game works, but seems very pedestrian, like they churned it out in an afternoon. The artwork on the cards is nice, but has no bearing at all on the game and almost none on the theme (example, a picture on one of a tunnel under a bridge - wtf ?). In a word I found it boring. I could be coerced into playing it again, but I'd NEVER ask for it.  For if I want a set collection filler that has a better theme I'll play my Sobek.

a short, light, entertaining set collection game.  On your turn you may either take gems (the game's currency), spend those gems to buy cards from the display, or reserve a card for yourself to buy later (getting a gold ["wild" gem] also).  The cards purchased have a gem pictured, permanently giving the holder that gem to spend every turn.  Also, some of the cards give points, ranging from 1 to 4.  The game ends on the round when someone gets at least 15 points.

This might be my new go-to gateway game.  It appears to be a straight forward engine building game...well it is... but there is more complexity and more strategic options than at first appears.  After 5 games, I'm still looking forward to trying different things.

The real allure here is a very simple rule set with some depth and a short play time that escalates quickly.  Indirect player interaction is enough to keep from being multi-player solitaire, while not turning off confrontation-disliking players.

Components are really amazing.  They're almost over the top, but the components take it from being a good game to a great one.

I played this game with Liz and some other guy whose name I forget. It was pretty much a Euro, by which I mean exactly like a Euro, by which I mean you're just taking turns doing a solitaire kinda sorta math problem thingie about nothing in particular and then counting up points.

What is the deal with "engine building?" If this game were a car, it would be [i]just[/i] an engine, sitting by the curb, humming along efficiently under the admiring stares of the unsmiling. An AmeriTrasher would walk up and ask, "What does it do?" And the admirers would just shrug and say, "But look how it hums!"

I'd like to say that at this point--finally--something explodes. But it's not that kind of game.

But hey, two points for Liz.

RATING: 7
Easy-to-teach, game. The fast pace and reduced playing time make it enjoyable.  Initially, after a dozen of games, we thought we figured out the optical tactics and felt it a bit repetitive. Then (after spending also a lot of time playing with the app) we realised it is  not so easy to find the optimal trade-off between resources and points, due to the need of reaching as fast as possible the required amount of Prestige Points. In four players the game seems more complex in term of choices but also a bit more random (difficult to predict what cards will be available in your turn).

UPDATED ON 19/2/18: since December 2017 my wife and I have been playing often the app version (especially when we are distant), reserving the board game mostly for more than two players.

THIS game is sitting in the top 100?  Have people taken leave of their senses?  There is nothing remotely novel or interesting in this game, a snowballing card purchase engineer where a lead is hard to lose, and the Flip of a card defined your strategy.  The artwork is nothing special, and the rules are so simple as to be simplistic.  Nothing in the game entiteit me to even open the box again.  One of the top one hundred of all time?  No, I guess I am so far from mainstream it no longer is even amusing.

This may not have any new mechanics, but it hits a sweet spot in my collection.  Easy to teach, easy to learn, a short play time, plays fine with 2-4, and the promise that we should be able to get better at it.

It makes for a pretty quiet game though.  Nobody says very much because they don't want to give away what they're thinking, and because they're busy concentrating on what to do next.

A group of us gathered to play this one evening. It took a little bit of time but once we got the gist of it - it became an instant addiction! We've hosted game parties and Splendor has become a popular addition to our household! I need to play when we have lesser than a full complement of players and the only real regret to the game is the fact that it's limited to 4 players -- that's how popular this game is! But we quickly found out that we can form teams to help with strategy as you work your way to winning all the victory points you can! This one was a keeper and one of the first games I bought here locally - I so love supporting our local game store!!!

After 9 plays, my wife and I (mid 30s part-time Eurogamers w/young kids) love this game!!

It is quick to understand, easy to play, and leaves you with that "Let's just play one more time" feeling.

We love engine building games, but our lifestyle allows us to play mostly just quick games.  Splendor satisfies both of these criteria.   Sometimes we each wish that the we had a couple more turns in the game to better realize the output of our engines (and it would be easy to allow this, simply raising the number of victory points required to trigger the last round).  However, doing this would clash with criteria #2.

As a side note, our 2-year old twins love to play with the gem chips!!  They just sort them by color/gem into the pockets in the box insert and then declare "all done."  They actually request this game more than some of the kids games we have purchased to play with them.

This is a great Eurogame, simple, easy to teach, plays quickly. It's probably the distilled essence of what a Eurogame is. The problem is that there isn't much complexity to it and after a few playthroughs it gets boring because it lacks in depth. Still great for quick plays, and you can play "Epic Rules" by playing until all cards are bought.

What a great game. Feels like a classic Knizia which is a big complement. Gets tense in the end when you want to take a card, but don't want to reveal easy pickings for your opponents, and likewise when you really need your opponents to clear the field. There's a bit of luck for sure, but I think the best player's usually going to win this one.

First - amazing production values that make it a joy to own and behold I love the art - really great stuff. 

Early thoughts:

Game can suffer from significant AP. Unsurprising given the range of options available.

Really think there should be a score chart. Keeping an eye on all opponents' scores is a bit of a pain.

Dislike that consecutive turns can pass when your best decision is simply to buy a card at zero cost. It's a forced optimal move that removes meaningful decision making.

Early rating: 5

Upped to 6.5 and heading upwards.

Love this game. The artwork is gorgeous, the jewels are heavy and tactile. The game plays easily, and there is lots of planning and contingency planning.

I've played this game several times now, and every time I play, each player is incredibly invested in the game. It's impressive when brand new players can become immediately invested in the strategy.

Admittedly, the theme is pretty much absent in the game. You never feel like you're a jewel merchant hiring workers or operating mines. However, I would argue that the mechanics come first in this game, and boy are they spectacular.

Splendor was voted BGG's 2014 Game of the Year (beating out Dead of Winter), and I absolutely agree.

A great strategy game. A lot of thinking is required, in order to outwit your opponents you must think many turns ahead. A blast for those who want to work their brain. The only issue is that it can cause a lot of tension between players as people steal cards out from under each other. Short turns allow for the game to flow smoothly and quickly, there's no waiting on your opponent and you're always calculating your next move.

(only 1 play) I can see why people like it- really simple yet compelling gameplay: figure out the efficient path to points while watching (and maybe blocking) your opponents. super easy to teach family-style game. I legitimately had fun.  HOWEVER, maybe this isn't true, but I felt like I had seen the entire scope of its strategy in that one play; I'm wondering if I would get bored after another couple plays.  We'll see. It intrigued me enough that I'd be interested to try it again.

RATING: 9
Splendor does what not many games do in that it wraps up a brain-burner experience into a simple, quick almost filler game package. It's quick, so it's not a big commitment, but it's not a dumb little game not much thinking. What results is a game where everyone feels satisfied because each turn is a meaningful decision (with just enough choices to be a thinker but not so many that you get analysis paralysis), and everyone wants to play again because it was so quick. The combination of it being both quick and so strategic makes it addicting. Also, every single person I've introduced the game to raves about the components - everyone loves poker chips! 

If there's one thing that is keeping this game from being perfect in what it is, it's that the theme is lacking. The theme itself is unclear - we're gem merchants? Trading, no selling, no buying, ... I'm not sure what we're doing, but we're doing SOMETHING with gems! And the game mechanics, while elegant and fun, don't contribute to the theme.

The only thing I wish this game came with was some sort of playmat. I purchased a third party custom playmat for the game and it really elevated the experience. 

Really looking forward to the expansions.

Game that got my wife into board games, which deserves an 8 just for that. Simple and fun. Easy to pick up. Even though the theme means very little, it does make it accessible and thus easier to get the anti-games peoples to play. I prefer the game 2 or 3 player compared to 4 though.

This game absolutely did not make us go crazy the way it seems to have done with the rest of the BGG population. It's almost mind-numbingly simple, and I kept trying to "break" it with some bare-bones strategy or another. But it managed to bend, not break, and kept us coming back for just one more game. It still lacks allure--nothing's calling us to play it again--but I can see why other people find this to be a solid title.

After playing it once at a game fair, this game immediately went to the top of my wishlist: this is really a neat game. Easy to teach, beautiful components with the heavy poker like chips but hard to get your gem-engine started up... really nice! Already played it with 2 and 3 players and it's perfect with both number of players. Would like to play a 4 player game too but maybe it becomes more luck dependent.

Fun as a filler game, but the enjoyment fades if played multiple times in a row. Plotting out a course from the level 1 cards all the way up through the level 2 and 3 cards and the noble tiles makes for a neat little puzzle, and having to change and adapt due to other players add a nice bit of competition that keeps this from feeling too much like solitaire.

An elegant, quick, and simple game that is easy to teach and learn. But, there is also a lot of strategy and depth to the game despite how easy it is. It's a game that is easy to introduce to non-gamers, and everyone will have a good time.

I like how well everything in the game works. Going for a few big point cards, or going for lots of smaller cards to build a stronger engine. Playing for the nobles. Denying cards and/or gems from other players. It all just works so well. 

The game scales excellently from 2-4 players. It's a great game to have - it can be a little bland which means it doesn't get to the table as often as it should, but when it does I'm never disappointed.

Light filler, overproduced (but the fiches are just too good to hold in your hand!), at the mercy of luck with a bare layer of decisions based on 1-2 ideas (set collection, cards shopping). Dry, slow engine.

If you need a special thing-in-a-box  just to teach non-gamers the basics of resource management mechanism to use in actual games, buy this one.
For all other occasions, this is overly simple and dull. I get it, gateway games are supposed to be simple, but this is way too trivial even for a gateway game.
No chance to manipulate card order, just a pure abstract chase for victory points... whoever gets his turn in the moment when good cards randomly come to play is likely to win. And I quite like abstract games, I just don't understand why do they need to add a totally non-connected theme. And I am perplexed by the hype.

Giving this an 8 for now, but I have a feeling the fun will wear off after more plays. Super easy to teach and seems to work with non-gamers as a good introduction to board gaming. Fun little engine game, good components and works well with 2 players also. Check out the app as well.

I was quite dissapointed with Splendor. It`s basically naked mechanics with very bland theme pasted on. It has long and boring beginning phase where everyone just buys something to get the engine going. When the gem-engine finally starts to work, the game is already over. My gaming group didn`t think that this was worth the hype. I will play this if somebody brings it to the table, but don`t need to own a copy. If i like to do some engine building, I`ll grab Dominion and if I just want a brain-teasing and addictive filler, then Biblios (2-4p) or Jaipur (2p) are far better options.

Mindig kétkedve gondoltam a Splendor sikerére, de a Társasjátékok Ünnepén a kíváncsiság leültetett mellé (meg az akció). De jól tette! Ha ez nem addiktív, akkor nem tudom, mi az. Témája nincs, grafikája sem tetszik, de roppant egyszerű, gyors, és rendkívüli sikerélményt ad, mikor a vége felé beindul a gépezet. Aztán persze hirtelen vége. De annyira jó érzés volt a végén, hogy újra szeretném átélni! Aztán újra, és újra és.. Ah, most már értem a sikerét. Világot nem renget meg, de leültet játszani. Kell ennél több?
A kipróbálás miatt az akciós példányokról lecsúsztam, de már berendeltem, szóval nemsokára itthon is bedobom!

Played A LOT.  The students that play board games after school love this game.  I even had on student who read a big ol' pile of books to get a copy with her AR points.  A game is already going and you showed up late?  Sure I'll play a game.  It reminds me of solitaire a bit, but there is definitely interaction (let me buy that card!).  I get that the theme is pasted on, but the components feel nice and look beautiful.  It is also a nice iOS ap to boot.  I only wish the box was a bit smaller.  I have reboxed many games in tiny boxes for shelf space, but I can't bring myself to take it apart.... yet.  I think this is still a great game... but I am tired of it.  My students play the mess out it still.

The game is super streamlined and plays very smoothly.  Setup and play time is appealing.  It's not the deepest game, and runaway leader is a likelihood.  

Bottom line generally has been that the first player who gets his engine going wins.  However, it is a fun game and the playtime is short enough that you never suffer particularly long after you realize you have no chance to win.

The family is still asking to play this one, and I don't regret it so that speaks to the appeal of the game as we'll.

I like games with very simple, clear rules, so this hits the spot. That said, it's a really dry game that doesn't encourage particularly interesting interaction with other players--the games I've played have been fairly quiet, and basically your only interaction with other players is blocking them (nabbing cards before they do or starving them of the colour tokens they want). I'll play this game willingly but it lacks flavour.

It is rare when you play a new game and your family ask to apply it again straight afterwards.... And this has happened with Splendor. It is fast and includes just enough Stratgey to keep a gamer happy whilst also being suitable for family play. There is a luck element with the card draw but the game is so very smooth that it warrants it's SdJ nomination! 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Absolutely brilliant. Beware of the slightly slow ramp-up phase in which nobody has enough resources to really start buying cards. It can get a bit boring and tedious. But as your group becomes more confident in its own strategies and starting-phase strategies, people will begin to act faster and you'll be able to pass the initial low-resource phase very quickly. From that point on, the game is a blast.

There is something lacking in Splendor, I just don't know what. Theme (there is none, don't kid yourself) or flavor, maybe? But it's still oddly satisfying to play, maybe because of the sturdy chips, and it looks beautiful. Probably a bit too dry/boring for me to hit all bases, but not bad per se.

I love how the game starts slow and then accellerates esponentially. I like the tension that gradually build up, as well as the components and the artwork. I also like that turns usually go fast so you do not feel the downtime.  

However, most of the games are usually played in dead silence, with almost no interaction. You build your engine and that's it. Also, the luck of the draw with cards on the board plays a more significant factor than one might think. In some games it does not matter, but I feel it does a bit in this one.  

It might be because I played this game too much in a short span of time, but I don't find myself wanting to play it often.

When I'm in the mood to stare at my partner and have him be one step ahead of me, Splendor comes to the table.  The coins are a heavy-weight so you have something to play with as your thinking two-three steps ahead.  My spontaneity gets in the way as I realize he's going to win the turn before he actually does, and theres nothing I can do to stop him, I'll be 1-3 points behind. Must play again to work on strategies!

It's the king of gateway game, probably the lighter I have in my collection. I think it miss a bit of player interaction, this probably come with a future expansion but anyway it's a fun game to play and it's an excellent one to introduce new player to the hobby.

Un "set collecting / engine building" très léger et vraiment rapide. C'est le roi des jeux d'introduction. Probablement le jeu le plus léger que je possède. Je pense qu'il manque un peu d'intéraction entre les joueurs, ça viendra surement avec une extension future mais c'est quand même un excellent jeu, amusant et c'est un excellent choix pour introduire des nouveaux joueurs dans le passe-temps.

Has a lot of the same feel as Ticket to Ride, but it's presented in a very abstract way. The components are WAY overproduced when compared to the game play. This could have easily been a deck of cards that came in a tuck box, and it would have had the same effect. Games of this tend to be a little scripted, in my experience. You either go for the people tiles or the tier 3 cards. Whoever is able to do so most efficiently while taking the luck of the draw into account will win this game. It's fine, but nothing exciting for me anymore.

This is a fantastic engine building game. Like 7 Wonders, it plays very quickly but it still feels like you get a deep strategy experience. Even with such simple rules, there are many different paths to victory. You can try to build your engine with many cheap Tier 1 cards, or rush to the second and third tier to collect points and hopefully end the game early. But it's also a good idea to try and satisfy the nobles.

I very much recommend it. The only problem is that there is a lot of information on the table which means that sometimes you don't notice some of the possible options, and players may be overwhelmed when looking at all the cards in the offer.

 "Come play Splendor. It's a game where you play as a jewel merchant in renaissance Italy". 

It doesn't sound hugely exciting. But it is. The game has a brilliant way of working and only a minimal amount of luck. It's really about finding the best deals, spending your coins wisely and knowing when to build infrastructure and when to save up for a big purchase, all whilst keeping an eye on what the other players are doing. It's bloody great.

Acquire gem tokens, use to buy developments that grant permanent "gem bonuses," buy developments that grant prestige points, acquire enough developments to win a noble card that grants another 3 prestige points.  At the end player with highest score 15 or above wins.  Not sure you want to invest $33 bucks?  Try the app which is a lot of fun.

In this game, there are five different colors of gems, plus a 6th color, gold, which acts as a joker. Players use gems to buy development cards (which provide more gems or give VPs) and they may be able to attract nobles for more VPs. The mechanics are very simple (collect gems, reserve card and gain a gold or buy a card). 

There is a lot of angst waiting to see if the card you want is going to get snapped up by an opponent, and you have to decide if you want to reserve a card. There is a race element to be the first one to 15 VPs, and also a race to see who can get the nobles first. It's a lot of fun, and I'd like to get in more plays. 

I can see the strategy progression in this game. First we tried to buy row 1 cards for cheap and get the nobles, now we have progressed to reserving row 2 cards (6 gems for 3 VP as it is the most economical). I can hardly wait to see how the next games go and looking forward to more plays.

I really liked the look, feel, gameplay, and elegance of this game. It has a huge amount of replay value and a quick set up and take down for the layers of strategy it offers in what is essentially an elegant and simple card drafting and resource management game. I actually prefer this game over 7 wonders--not that they're incredibly similar but I do like it. That being said, it is fundamentally an abstract game and mistakes you make early can really hold you back throughout but I can see this being incredibly fun between several players who are all seasoned and played multiple times. Luckily, because it's simple and easy to teach and fast, it's quick to get people to become seasoned. Definitely a winner despite being largely abstract which is usually quite a negative for me.

It is hard to explain why I love this game so much.  Simply brilliant while being brilliantly simple.

My only complaint is that you just get your development cards going well and the game ends.

I love how it gives a wonderful feeling of escalation, like you are really building something. It has a decent amount of planning mixed with having to adapt to what other players are doing and the ever changing cards on display. That description makes it sound pretty much like a lot of other games, but this one is amazing. 

It is beautiful I love the art on each card as well.

Easy enough to engage with, with higher-value mines tempting you with their just-out-of-reach costs.  It should be a race to build an engine and then let it run, but it's just as likely someone can short-cut that and shoot your plans down in flames.  Which is where the fun lies.

I like the simplicity and tension offered by having one action per turn.  I enjoy the engine building, but I feel that the game is over once I start to get going--that may be intentional, in order to increase the game's addictiveness.

RATING: 8
Like this game quite a bit, but I do have some issues though:

1) If you compress it, it takes up about 1/4th of the box...I really wish they hadn't made it so extravagant/obnoxiously big. I know it goes with the Splendor theme of rich extravagance, but I wouldn't have minded slightly smaller gems in a much smaller box.

2) At least at 4P, it switches to a more tactical game than strategic one, and its harder to plan long term - there's not much you can do if your plan happens to overlap with the two players next to you and the fourth takes advantage. Once you're behind, you stay behind but fortunately the game ends pretty shortly and skill will prevail more often than not.

There are some ways I think this game could've been improved (personally at least): more variant rules and objective/bonus cards to spice up the game some more (ex: set number of turns variant, most greens gets a bonus, fewest cards gets a bonus, etc - these are just ideas, I'm sure the designer could come up with better if he had time), player mats to track the chips and cards (not necessary but its a nice touch as players may miscount the number of chips they have and the box has a lot of space), and I wouldn't have minded more nobles.

As far as similarities, I think this game feels extremely similar to both Ticket to Ride and Dominion, but I prefer Splendor. Light ish theme, engine building, card generation...I do like that its easier to set up though and no shuffling, so I do prefer it, though there's no special or cool effects (which is part of the allure, its simplicity). Its selections are similar to TTR's and its close simplicity wise too, though its time is much faster and more consistent than both. Interaction wise, its mostly blocking, which I don't mind.

One small issue is how gunning for VPs can get you the 15 VPs really quick, which changes this from the engine game I thought it was originally. Not sure how I feel about this, but I could always play to more points if I want a longer game.

Very nice gateway game with simple mechanics but has gameplay deep enough to keep you playing again and again.

Pros:
- Easy to understand mechanics and only a few rules.
- Goes well with the whole family or seasoned gaming group

Cons:
- Purely mechanic game stripped to its basics with paper thin theme, not very immersive
- Huge box compared to the amount of components wasting your shelf space

Has all the makings of a nice filler/gateway game: Quick to set up, quick to explain, quick to play. Decisions are not that overly complicated to induce AP but winning still requires some thought. Great game to introduce players to the concept of synergistic card combinations. The race for certain cards and the nobles creates a nice tension. Nevertheless, there is otherwise no player interaction and games are often a very quiet affair. Cards also seem to be a bit unbalanced even within the same level which can give the starting player an advantage.

I feel like in this game you just go through the motions and then all of a sudden a winner appears. I like games where at the end you can turn to the winner and say "that move you did when you did that thing and stuff, that was awesome!" In Splendor it goes more like, "remember that time you got that red gem and then that blue gem and then some things happened and then you won?"

Also some of the cards are actually unbalanced. You may buy a card and it replaced by an identical card that costs less. People say there's strategy but everyone's strategy is the same. Try and get the nobles. But everyone is trying to do this and it just ends up being a random game of buying gems and doing things until a winner suddenly appears.

Great components, even if the game does have a pointlessly tacked-on theme. However, the game is deceiving in that there are not as many paths to victory as the game would first have you believe. When playing games like "Caverna" or "Blood Rage", there are so many strategies that players can commit to in order to have a chance of winning the game, and these strategies can change from game to game. Even "Sushi Go!" has more viable paths to victory than this game! "Splendor" does not have the mechanics to reward the freedom to choose how to accumulate points, and therefore becomes a very bland (and overhyped) experience.

Quick game of picking up different colored chips to pay for cards.  If there are enough chips, you can take two of one color, otherwise you are taking three of different colors.  

As you collect and pay for cards, you will be able to buy level 2 and 3 cards because each card will also count as a permanent chip at your disposal.  There are also characters you can bring to your cause if you collect, for example, three blue cards, three white cards, and three black cards.

First to 15 points wins.

For how tense and evenly-matched the game should play, it's unfortunate how much who wins comes down to luck of the draw at the very end.

Splendor is everything I both love and despise about modern board games. It is a simple design that is easy to teach, keeps runaway leaders to a minimum, plays equally well with 2-4 players, plays quickly and quietly in about 30-45min depending on AP... and it is SO dry.  You can hear the math in your head as you plot out your turns, and it gets very repetitive very quickly.  Also, the theme is nonsense; you are solving a math puzzle, and the game never lets you forget that.  The buy-in rate for non-gamers on this game, which is its target audience, is nearly zero.

The shine wore off Splendor in record time.  It occupies a space along with Kingdom Builder and will probably win awards like crazy, but yeah, I'm done.

UPDATED: Stop asking me to play this game.  Especially if you're going to analyze every single move to the point where it becomes a 45min game.  Here's how you win: Go for the Royals.  Don't do anything that isn't going to help you eventually win 1+ Royals.  It's literally that simple.

I really enjoy this game.  It's also a great game to introduce to non-gamers.  It's easy to teach and plays really smooth and fairly quick once you know what you're doing.

One person I know said they thought the game was too random, but I think having the available tableau gives a variety of options and allows for a different strategy each game.

And of course, as others have commented on, the chips just feel great to play with.

Very simple, clean and elegant snowball economic game - it's a bit of a stretch to call it an engine builder as the only engine you get is income.

It's quick and easy to grasp, and fun to play, but I do worry about replayability - it seems like one should do exactly the same thing every time (get cards, get better cards, win). But it will probably hold up as a good filler.

The art is great and really adds to the game. The theme is rather pasted-on though.

Simple engine building abstract game, with very simple and elegant rules, fast and fun. Great components as well, it's almost a deluxe edition.

I was greatly suprised after playing it: the rules are deceiving, the game has some depth, even if it's quite limited: you have to see what others are doing, especially the previous player, what tokens they have, etc. You don't always want to take cards, even if you can, even if they are cheap.

After some games, Splendor becomes a catchy mechanism. A very catching adorable mechanism that keeps you playing game after game.

First impression (4 players): 
I kind of liked the engine building and small-action optimization but at the end of game felt that it might too often be decided by a pretty random lucky draw of a nice 4/5 pointer card that just happens to fit somebody too well. To a lesser degree same applies of course during game to the engine building part.

Gioco di carte che si base sulla gestione e accumulo di risorse (pietre preziose). Offre una forte interazione e necessita di attenzione, non manca un buona dose di strategia ma è anche la componente fortunita rivestirà un ruolo importante/determinante.

A pleasingly efficient and swift game, but ultimately one without many nuances or a great deal of strategy. Essentially a disappointing rip-off of St Petersburg that came 15 years too late to be a real success.

One suspects that if the currency had come on disappointing cardboard punch-outs rather than the glorious tactile chips then the game would have been a whole lot less popular. An example of genuine value added by intelligent publishing.

Engine-building game in the filler range. 

I'm missing a little bit of "flavour" in this. It's mechanically very solid and fun enough to play, but nothing I'm getting excited about. It's almost like the definition of "streamlined", but to me it feels like it lost some of the edges in the process that might make it more special. 

I still recommended it to a couple of people in the family that I tought would like it and they indeed love it. I ended up getting my own copy as a present and although I don't love the game I'm still happily keeping it around.

Very simple rules, yet nicely developing tactical game with interesting player interaction. Feels good to play, because every player is able to develop a nicely evolving economy. 

Also seems to have very close finishes. Luck factor cannot be denied and might (always?) be game deciding in the end. Have not played enough to say if that is an issue. For a fairly light game, it might be fine.

I love the chips. Very good haptical experience, especially due to the added weight. Box could be half the size, but I understand why they didn't size it down.

[b]Splendor[/b]* was reaquired 11/2/17 and then sold via auction 2/19/17. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Update - this was one of the games my kids told me they missed when we went through our previously owned list. I decided to pick it up again for them and because the short play time will fit in better with our current gaming availability. 

The first time I played it I was completely underwhelmed. Then I got the game as a gift and played it a lot with my kids over the course of a month. Then it fell off a cliff, I think we all got tired of the game play and complete lack of a theme. A lot of people have mentioned that this is a great gateway game, but I strongly disagree. I don't think it holds up to repeated play which to me is a huge part of what defines a good gateway game (Ticket to Ride and Camel Up come to mind).

I will also mention that I absolutely agree with Camel Up winning the Spiel last year. Camel Up has delivered every time I pull it out whether it is family, gamers and more casual gamers. I don't think Splendor holds a candle to Camel Up.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Easy to teach, quick play time.
- Great family game.
- Beautiful components [i](yes this is definitely part of the appeal of this game).[/i]
- Stripped down version of 7 Wonders [i](collecting resources to buy other card types).[/i]
- 3 levels of cards which are worth more points and provide you with a resource.
- Bonus nobles can really change how you play the game.
- You need to pay attention to your opponents and possibly take cards you don't need so they don't score easy points.[/i]

Such an elegant game has massively broad appeal. This has become my wife and I's defacto week night game to play. we usually find the time to squeeze in two games a night. It has that feeling like cribbage that you could just play it a ton and not run that well dry. But even better it works great with 3 and 4 players as well. Really just a gem of a game, ha puns.

Awesome game at 2 or 3. Love the variable ways to play, either slowly building up the engine or hitting the big points early. Highly tactical in that one needs to pay attention to the availability of card colors and the progression. Have yet to grasp the skill of using the reserve action. Only thing disconcerting is the abrupt end to the game if the last player reaches 15 points first.

One of those games where you can play it as a light filler and let it play itself, taking the obvious chips for cards you can buy before the other players will have the requisite chips, and therefore buying cards as they present themselves. Or you can study exactly what chips all the other players have at all times, what cards they're intending to go for next and alter your plans accordingly. Put me in the former bucket. With new cards coming out all the time, taking the extra time is probably worthwhile results-wise, but just not worth it given the luck and the slowing down of the game for the other players. Take chips, buy cheap cards that allow you to build with less chips later, build an engine accordingly, buy bigger cards worth VPs, hope cards come out that you can buy cheaply and that the same doesn't happen to the other players - then you'll enjoy the win. Take chips or take a card. Every turn. Not that interesting. Ok for what it is, but too decision-light and theme-light and fun-light to warrant a lot of replay.

RATING: 7
As a gateway game, everyone I have introduced it to has liked it.  As Eurogamers, my wife and I can play this game in 20 minutes with our eyes closed.  It doesn't offer a lot of meat.  We have to hold our tongues when watching new players agonize over what they should do on their turns.  It's a pure engine builder, so what a person should do on their turn may be easily apparent to experienced onlookers. Nevertheless, we cannot deny that it has been successful when used as a gateway game. 

But so has ticket to ride.  And ticket to ride is better because although it is a gateway game, it still has something for gamers.  It has tension in the forms of: 'push your luck', 'take that', and secret objectives.  So as a gamer, I enjoy introducing people to ticket to ride more than Splendor.  Overall, I'd put it in my "good game" category - a rating of 7.  Not OMG great.  But still good.

"Good, but overrated, abstract engine-building game. It's OK, but my brain has trouble calculating card gems + chip gems (+ wild gems), and relies a bit too much on denial for my tastes. Rating went from 6 to 7 with more plays. I won't ask to play it, but won't resist either. "

What I like:
- Easy to teach and learn
- The chips have a nice heft
- Plays quickly (45 minute 3p learning game)
- I like engine-building

What I don't like:
- Abstract
- Relies heavily on denial (including hoarding)
- Excessively large box

This is a decent little game. Thinkier than it appears, although it can be played (poorly) without much strategy. I think it's awfully dry (and thinky) for an SdJ, but abstracts have won before. I have trouble seeing why so many people are going gaga over it, but I suppose it does have a bit of Knizia-like minimalist charm.

Although there are no attacks (yay), I really dislike the form of interaction. If I reserve a card, I might get denied the chips I need, plus I'm falling behind in getting resources. but if I collect the resources first, the card I'm saving for might get taken before I get to it. For some reason, I just don't enjoy that form of "damned if you do, damned if you don't" dilemma in games. 

I guess the BGG-voted weight of 1.8 is reasonable. It's simpler than that rules-wise, but has more depth.

Simple lite filler game ...but can become a little samey after too many plays ...if the nobles had special powers this would have perhaps incentivised the players to aim towards them rather than just garner more VPs and spiced up the game play ...

Great components ...in fact almost over done !

Over all though providing it's not played too often it's a great game for those evenings when you are too tired to play anything too thinky ...

Splendor is a well-balanced, approachable game for new and old players alike. What I especially like about this game is that it is quite fun whether you have 2, 3 or 4 players. My wife and I love playing 1 vs 1, and yet it is also fun if you have a third wheel or another couple to play with. The chips are solid and well made, and give you a very "casino chip" tactile experience. The game layout is fairly compact, and it works well with limited table space.

Fell in love with it, the first time I touched those poker chips. Pure class.

The game itself is exactly what I need to have fun. Plan your moves, watch your gem collection expand, curse your opponents for ruining everything for you (reasonable interaction).

With 2 players the game is faster and has a cut throat feel to it. With 3,4 players there is more room for strategic moves (prefer it that way) but I found that some of the non gamers get easily detracted and maybe a bit bored while waiting for their turn.

The game is extremely easy to teach (no more than 5 minutes) and the theme of the game (although not very strong) is pleasing for everyone.

My brother owns it and I steel think of buying it (probably I won’t but that says a lot).

(Wife's Point of View: Bored to death.

...My brother's girlfriend likes it a lot though)

*Update: Bought my own copy, threw the box away and keep everything in a deck tower for portability reasons. ...my brother and his girlfriend went separate ways! This is a take-away game. Get rid of the box.

20+ plays - Perhaps one of the best gateway games. It wasn't initially a favourite, but all my non-gamer friends and family have responded so well to it, I have included it in my collection. I have come to like it more over several plays. The engine (discount) building is satisfying and you can either try racing for the noble bonuses by grabbing lots of low cost cards, or racing for the high point value cards, by being more strategic about the cards/ discounts you accumulate, so they match the top tier cards.

This is a great entry game for non gamers but also works well with gamers. The rules are simple but there is enough strategy that everyone can enjoy it. It plays in about 40 minutes where you collect coins to buy cards, but the cards you buy also count as coins so you must build up your engine. However you must be sure not to lose sight of the goal and gather points faster then your opponents. You can also block them by taking the coins they want and reserving cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid filler. Pure engine building that has a very important timing aspect, knowing when to switch from building your engine to start collecting the big point cards. The first few games I played off this I misjudged the timing and did not score very well, now I’m a bit more experienced I find myself much more competitive. You need to start collecting the big points much earlier than I first suspected, however now I find that I am susceptible to going for it too early and end up struggling to collect the resources needed to pick up the big points.

The ‘shopping’ aspect of collecting resources really seems to appeal to a large group of gamers. I can see this staying in my collection for some time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An accessible engine building game that will appeal to families/casual gamers.  Despite the simplicity, there is some thought and planning involved and there is room for screwage for those who choose to play that way.  Since the SdJ has become geared towards family styles games, this is a perfect fit for the award even though the award went to another title.

Great game. Great at all player count. More strategy and blocking involved than I was expecting. With players that are paying attention you have to be discreet and not give your strategy away or pick a strategy with multiple paths or big cards to buy.

This game will probably go down over time just because there probably isn't a terribly large amount of strategy or variety once you've put in 20 plays or so. May end up being a flash in the pan.

Rating downgraded a bit since it hasn't seen play in a while.

Played mostly with 2.

I have a weird opinion about Splendor: I enjoy playing it, but will basically never suggest it.  It's such a pure engine-building game that when it goes off the rails I feel like there's nothing I can do to stop it, which can make the act of playing it feel very frustrating.  I respect the hell out of it, but I'm not always in the mood for that purity of design.

The randomness of the rows can also sometimes be a huge detriment, in that they stymie reasonable attempts to build towards nobles, and punish players who actually attempt to clear cards from the rows. I like to call this the "Ascension" design flaw, and it's weird to see it in what is otherwise such a tight design.

Splendor is an engine-building filler, where you collect and spend gems to buy cards that make buying future cards cheaper.  As the game progresses you'll be able to afford more expensive cards, which aren't any better than the cheap cards in-game, but do provide more points.  You can also claim goal tiles if you're the first one to collect a certain assortment of cards.  All the cards to be claimed are public, so sniping is possible, but you can see what everyone is doing, so there's not much surprise.  I don't think I've played a filler that feels like this before, so it gets points for originality, but it still only has a filler's amount of depth.

Comment: Turns are incredibly quick once you get your bearings. It's not a deep game, but a very tactical one although you do have to plan ahead. The games pieces are some of the best I've seen. Now if they only went with linen cards... Beautiful artwork on all the cards but unfortunately the theme is rather thin. Clicking the poker chips together does give you that merchant feeling as if you had a handful of gold coins.

Splendor is what I wanted Jaipur to be. Simple, yet entertaining decisions throughout. Jaipur failed on the interesting decisions part.

Optimal Player Count: 3 > 2 > 4

Extras: Cards are sleeved in FFG silver sleeves. I had to cut the insert and turn the cards sideways to fit properly. I just didn't want to throw away the insert since it's quite nice.

The game plays quickly and can be a good race vs other players.  The tactics of which colors to build up and complete to get a build engine going and beat others is good.  I like the reservation mechanism as well.

The game's engine is rather bland--get lower stones to get better stones and so on until game end.  Great for a quick filler, however with slower or max people, can slow the game down and overstays its welcome.

RATING: 6.5
Really fun-seeming game with an unacceptably low strategy ceiling. I can win almost every time now, unless somebody else uses my exact strategy better than me. Which hasn't happened. 

First few games - "This is cool!"
Next few games - "Hmm... strategy is evolving... cool!"
All games after that - "Oh, it's my turn? there's 15. Game over."

The rules for this game are pretty simple, and all the information is public.  Gameplay goes around in circles, and most turns you get to take a card.

I had a lot of fun the two times I played this, but I suspect that may just be because I won.  I worry that replay value might be low as (1) everyone figures out the optimal strategy for the game and (2) people bog down in analysis-paralysis trying to predict which of their moves would have the least convenient consequences for their opponents.

What would it take to expand this? Meaning, do I have to buy the expansion? 

Very Easy: Strongholds (3 tokens, when buy card, can place a stronghold) - use the ticket to ride things...or even just poker chips (white, red, green, black, blue)...Tom hated it and said it should go to the trash can.

Moderate: printing out the 7 double-sided cities card (replaces royals). Tom said this was good. 

Not easy: the orient is a deck of cards with new symbols. 

I don't REALLY like the game THAT much...but if this came down to 15 bucks, I'd probably get it.

It took me quite a few plays to figure out where the game is, but there's a lot more going on in this game than might appear when you first try it.  The key to the game is balancing investment (in the form of purchasing no-point cards for future return) vs. simply saving up to buy points.  The calculation will be different each time, and may change based on the actions of other players.  Finding this game more enjoyable over time and not less, which is a surprise.  Bumping the rating up to 8.

My standard strategy is to only claim cards with points on them. It is strikingly successful, especially if nobody else is doing it. It’s not too much fun, but pursuing any other strategy just seems like playing slow— and I don’t enjoy this so much that I want to stretch out the experience.

Dry and dull. Appallingly dry and dull. I suppose I can see there's a game in here - my wife really enjoys it, as do much of my game group, but it's just not for me. There's nothing that encourages me to go through the repetitive, grinding, mechanical motions for the sake of adding up points at the end of the game based on... what... colours? 

If you love theme, if you look beyond the stars for adventure, for escape... there's nothing for you here. This is abstract gaming in all its beige glory. Horrible.

There are very few games which just knock it out of the park for me on the first play.  On the night I acquired it, Splendor became one of them.  Fast, fun, simple, addictive.  And therefore, in my eyes, achieves what it sets out to do.  It is also a very welcome illustration that theme is the least interesting / vital part of a good game.  A winner.

This game is pretty light! I wasn't expecting this game to be this light. I've only had 2 plays under my belt but it seems like in a 2-player game the nobles are must have. I won the first one because my fiancee isn't paying attention to the nobles and in the second game we fought for the nobles and when I lost the nobles I lost the game. It's a solid and easy to explain game that I can see myself playing with my parents but it doesn't scratch the gamer's itch too much for me. What a surprise though because it's got so much buzz on the geek. Will update rating if it changes with more play.

---- Update ----
Game is definitely more fun at 4 players. I got to try this at my local meetup with 4 players and it was more fun than 2 players. I will need to get the remove-cards in 1st tier variant a try before I finally give it a score.

---- Update ----
Removing half of the tier one cards leads to tighter 2-player experience. Game rating 7 -> 8.

RATING: 9
Straight up engine building filler game goodness.

This game benefits from being played often against the same person. When you get to know how your opponent thinks and you become familiar with the game & cards & strategy, there's a bit of a boxing / fencing vibe as you jockey back and forth for scarce resources to build a balanced hand that can win you the royals and then catapult you into a position to buy higher value cards and cross the finish line first. Such a smooth mechanic. Tough decisions beginning to end and very seldom does the deck favor one opponent over the other in a way that can't be overcome by good strategy. They must have play-tested it a lot before releasing it as this game plays like a Swiss watch and the component quality is first class and so is the artwork. 

Downsides / Caveats: Well, the theme is of secondary importance, though it is a nice theme and the artwork is beautiful. The box is big for what the game is. I put the game in a reproduction medieval coin-purse which not only looks cool but now the game travels well in a suitcase / purse / backpack.

It's an ok game, but (playing 3 to 4 players) the strategy just ends up diversify and conquer. The winner is pretty much the person who's diversification aligned best with how the new cards get drafted.

This is the most basic engine builder you could imagine. It was fine, but this really is like a kid's "My first engine builder" type game. I enjoyed the process but I'm not sure there's anything here to be excited about.

Good game, nice components.  But, it is 4-player...which is kind of a crowded field.  And it is a little on the light side.  It's the flavor of the week right now, but doubt it will be remembered once the next hotness that scratches the same itch comes out.

SOLID game! Not much to the theme. I almost didn't buy this one. I actually had no interest initially but I'm really glad I picked it up on a whim. This is one of my favorites now! 

Play with 4 = Good, but loose stuff you were eyeing to grab!
Play with 3 = Great and great balance!
Play with 2 = Great and feels completely different! You cannot play with the same strategy as with more players.

This is an odd one, because the simplicity of this game is exactly what I often claim to like. But unfortunately, in practice I found it deadly dull. Like Port Royal, it's a basic engine-builder with players racing to a VP target, but here it's stripped down to the bare minimum, with each card just providing a discount on one colour towards future purchases. And while the push-your-luck acquisition mechanic in Port Royal provides lots of laughs, the atmosphere in Splendor is more one of silent calculation.

A fast, simple engine-building game. There’s a decent mix of luck and strategy to it, but not a whole lot to think about. You can choose one or two nobles to try to go after that game, to give you a goal of which colors of gems you want to collect, but each turn you might not be able to work toward your goal depending on which cards are out. It is nice to see your tableau of gem cards grow and be able to buy more and more expensive ones over time, and getting a free one is satisfying.

5 - There must be a spark to this game that we missed something while playing because it absolutely fell flat with my group.  There was no energy, no table talk, no joy, just pure mechanical actions. The theme was fine, the game was well designed, but with everyone trying for the same goals no one wanted to give away a hint of their plans.  As soon as one player reached 15 points we packed the very nice components back into their box and moved on to another game.

Not so much interaction, it's more like a racing game and the winner is the one who build his engine quicker.
I need to play more to see if I keep it.

note1: bump it to 7.5 after another 3 games with a group of casual gamers. I actually enjoyed all games and decided to keep the game in my collection.

My rates are 9 for casual gamers, 6 for expierenced, 7.5 on average.

One of te best so called "fillers", fast, fun and yet not so light game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fast & light. Fun although far from 'addicting' as others have claimed. A clear strategy is needed to avoid just being 1 or 2 turns short of your own victory when the game ends. I think 15 VP is too little; extending the game to 20-25 VP would mitigate the 'luck-of-the-draw' for the highest point cards (that may never change before the final round). 

The 'claiming' of cards adds a small amount of nastiness that may be misplaced in such a light game (more experienced gamers will more easily see what others need for their strategy), as there is no penalty (other than a lost turn) in keeping cards out of play at the end of the game. I believe that any card held at the end of the game should cost 1 VP each, or better yet, no cards can be held in order to win.

Similar to Bazaar, where you collect gems to buy cards. Mechanics are different after that.

Get 1-3 gem chips per turn, and use them (and the gems on the purchased cards) to buy more cards.

Rules are pretty simple. Good engine building game mechanic while set collecting. Good replayability.

The game is relatively themeless, but it does not take away from its simple, smooth, and elegant gameplay. This is a fun, fast engine builder that has become a great gateway game. The production quality is fantastic: the cards are colorful, the noble tiles are thick, and the poker chips feel pleasantly heavy. The simple rules make this game easy to teach and the addicting gameplay make this hit the table very frequently.

You slowly accrue gems to buy cards which become permanent gems, and once you have enough permanent gems you can buy patricians, who simply give victory points, and whoever gets to 15 victory points typically is the winner (other players still get one more turn).

So, my takeaway was frankly the game wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It's very much a Euro, it plays fairly quick, and it just lacks any real meat. I felt like if maybe the patricians were then used to do something, as an additional layer to the game, it'd be REALLY good, but without that, it feels like it's missing a piece. The quality of the gem chips is very nice, some sort of ceramic-acrylic mix I'd bet, and that certainly adds some quality to the game, but overall a very underwhelming experience. I don't think it deserves any of the praise it's received. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple build your engine filler. Early game is used to collect chips to obtain cards to make buying future cards easier. Later you will be able to afford more expensive cards which also provides victory points. The first to collect certain assortments of cards will be able to claim Nobles (goal cards), which also provides points. 

All cards are public so you can see what others are doing, and can revise your optimization accordingly. It is a filler so there is little depth but it does play quickly. 

Like the chip components and I've not see this twist before so it get a point for originality. Also gets a point since my wife really likes it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Easy to learn and a curious puzzle to figure out. Unfortunately, it never feels like more than plastic chips and cards. It has a bare bones theme. In terms of gameplay, I never feel like I can master Splendor. You usually lose by failing to invest early on in a particular gem that becomes valuable later, which is entirely down to luck of the draw. More player interaction would have been nice too, such as exchanging cards. The highlight is the reserving mechanic, which allows you to take cards other players really wanted and you get a joker token. It's a clever idea that works well and players tend to lose by not reserving at all or wasting too much time reserving instead of gathering gems. I may play this again but overall the game got stale fairly quickly and does not have a lot of longevity or depth.

I find Splendor to be merely alright. I don't get the love for this one. Then again I tend not to like games where card flips allow players to immediately purchase or buy something that nobody else had a chance at. Still ultimately Splendor is just not that interesting to me. The theme is very weak and the gameplay is repetitive and uninspired. Will occasionally play on iOS just because it is relatively fast and easy, but in general reach for other options.

RATING: 5.5
(I've only played a single 2-player game of Splendor so far. This is just my notes-to-self)

= 2015-06-04

Almost a year later and I've only played the game twice now. Just wasn't that exciting. Putting it on the trade pile.

= 2014-05-22

I picked up Splendor because it was described as having "Fired" Jaipur. In some ways, however, it's the opposite of Jaipur. In Splendor, you're building up a points engine. The precious gems you collect are used to collect cards which then reduce the price of future card purchases. The game ramps up from multiple turns per victory point to multiple victory points per turn fairly quickly.

In Jaipur, you're taking cards to collect precious commodities. The most valuable scoring tokens are available early in the game and towards the end you're either fighting for one last high scoring bonus token or going back and forth on a few low scoring turns trying to end the game while you're ahead. Jaipur has a rather significant push-your-luck component. You might chose (or almost be forced) to take a large number of camel cards all at once and then have to draw a bunch of new cards for your opponent to chose from. Jaipur allows for a better calculation of risk. For each type of item (gold, diamonds, leather, etc), there is one more card than there are scoring tokens. If there's only one gold scoring token left, then there are two gold cards left. Do you risk letting your opponent take the 2nd to last gold card so you can focus on building up five leather cards? Is the "Most Camels" bonus worth the risk of turning up good cards for your opponent? Jaipur feels very interactive and it allows just enough calucation to feel like skill played a part in your win.

I haven't figured out Splendor yet. There's no penalty for reserving a card so if you're both (2 player game) getting close to earning a particular card, there's not a ton of risk in just grabbing it.

Once you collect your tokens in Jaipur, you're done with them. There's no reason to ever look back at the things you've earned (except to add up points at the end). In Splendor, you're constantly counting up how many of each token (real and virtual) the other player(s) has and evaluating that against the cards and nobles currently on the table.

Jaipur ends when three piles are exhausted and then the person with the most points wins. Splendor ends when someone gets to a certain number of points so the end game condition is also the win condition (I can't remember for certain, but I think the game continues until everyone has had the same number of turns).

We've only played one 2p game of Splendor, but I think I'll disagree at this point that it fired Jaipur if only because I don't think the games really scratch a similar itch.

Incidentally, I've seen a few people comment on how spectacular the components are in this game. It's true that the poker chips feel good and certainly give the game some heft but wouldn't little acrylic gems have been more thematic and cost less? If ever there was a game that would have benefited from oodles of shiny plastic gems, this is it.

Jan 2016: Some of my non-gamer friends have discovered it and can't get enough of it. Downgrade from 5.5 to 2. The game is simply not fun. 

Feb 2015: Minimalist engine building, optimization card drafting game. 

If this game came in a small box with small cardboard tokens instead of big plastic chips, then I would consider buying it. This game is too overproduced for how dry it is. In a way it feels like an abstract strategy game without its geometric elegance... All you are doing is acquiring resources for cards that give you VP and "permanent" resources. It's like an abstract because the game is usually played in pensive silence.

Splendor was such a wonderful game; fast, easy to learn / teach, quality components, eminently portable, with the perfect blend of strategy and luck. 

Then we figured out that reserving monochrome, high-value cards ASAP, then using Gold to cheat them out early was an invincible strategy. Splendor became a cutthroat (and much less interesting) experience as a result.

Great game!!! I love weighing up purchasing decisions on how to get points and build a economy at the same time. I got a lot of my friends into board gaming with this one.

Played it 20+ times already since I got it 3 days ago. Very splendid game. Really a very good abstract game. The only downside is, after playing 6-7 straight games your head starts to ache due to the fact of always searching and checking the costs of your card that would follow the pattern or number of gems for purchasing higher level gems or the nobles.

Nevertheless one of the best games to come out lately, winning the BGG boardgame of the year is no fluke. It truly deserve it. A real gem in my opinion. Replayability in the 100's (an evergreen game) as long as there are someone to challenge witn.

The component quality and simplicity of rules explanation mask what is at its core an AP inducer without any of the a-ha moments that usually follows when a strategy reveals itself.

In games like Five Tribes, you may think for a while, but you'll eventually come up with something to do and *have reasons for doing it*. In Splendor, every reason you may come up with is ephemeral. How do you weight choices or map decision trees when the actions that you take either accomplish nothing immediately (and rely on the card you are going after not being claimed) or sacrifice a large amount of resources to add a single component to your "engine".

Never understood why this game has so many haters. Best race game, hands down! By race game I mean you are racing to 15 points. I think it is strongest as a 2-player game but plays great at all player counts. Most of our 2-player games end with the loser stating that they would have won if they had 1 more turn, I love that. Easy to learn and plays fairly different every game becuase of the different starting cards and having to adapt to the cards that get flipped up.

Nice esthetics... yes a plastered on theme for what essentially is an abstract strategy game BUT it works well. Lots going on in terms of planning... counter-planning and I like the way the game builds as bonus-laden players can start to prestige point (victory point) at will near the end. Reserving developments is a critical part of the game and adds extra subterfuge. It is a classic, "simple to play but lots of time to master" but unlike other strategy games there is enough variation that you always need to change strategies on the fly.

Okay, I have to say I honestly don't get it. Why the raving reviews? Why the accolades? It's a very, VERY average game. And extremely basic at that - a single mechanic plus a bit of chrome (some pretty cards and nice, thick tokens). Thing is, I don't really think the game has anything new to offer in second, third or tenth play - and it didn't grab me during the first. Tried to understand what's the excitement about and failed miserably. 

For instance, building your little engine is not exciting at all. Okay, so I'll get a discount, so I can get more cards, to get even more discount, to get even more cards. Oh, look, somebody has 15 points already! And that's it. Well, sorry, but there are better light, gateway eurogames out there. Like Kingdom Builder, that game has so much more to offer! Or Dominion, or Carcassonne, or whatever. 

I will try it again, no doubt, maybe I missed something, but it was a huge "meh" for me.

This game should have been produced in a small box with a small price tag because it is light fun. Instead they went with medium price and box. Not the best way to go. There is no way this is worth more than $25 brand spankin' new from your FLGS and it should be no more than $20 on Amazon. Also, it could all fit nicely in a box the size of Resistance or For Sale. 

The game play was intriguing but simple and was reminiscent of The Builders: Middle Ages but more streamlined and elegant.

Card drafting, set collection game that is easy to teach and plays quickly. The art is pretty good, not great. The chips are well made and feel significant. Setup and tear down are quick which is always nice. Being easy to teach and learn along with the light theme makes this a good intro game, but if you make a few mistakes early or just do whatever without a plan, it can be hard to impossible to catch up to others. Easy to get to the table, but still offers a great deal of subtle gameplay that helps it stand out.

It's a great introduction game, even better than Ticket to Ride. It plays fast, is easy to learn and can be taught without language issues. The only downside is that it only fits 4 players, but perhaps a 5th player expansion is on its way. Or perhaps you can find a variant. This is very well designed and it's going to take the spot of my go-to intro game for the time being once I pick it up.

A decent game that has been boiled down to the bare essentials. The components are fantastic and the game plays fast, which makes it something I don't mind getting to the table once in a while, but I just don't see the buzz around this one.  Best used as an appetizer to the main course.

Splendor... how frustrating you are.

We borrowed this for a week and managed to play 3 games a day. For the first day, maybe two, I quite liked it. Slowly building up your gems so you can get better cards, strategically reserving certain cards at the right time, all stuff I usually like.

Then one of us read a guide on BGG and found out the best way to win was to reserve a high-value card, then just build up chips for it. I would like to say that we were able to block whoever tried to do this but sadly that strategy won every single time.

By the end of the week I'd had enough. I'll never play it again unless there's literally nothing else to play - there's nothing to bring me back to it.

After one play: I'm not ready to rate this one yet. I won, but I was sleepy and paying little attention to what my opponents were doing. So either I got lucky, or those who say that it's important to keep a close eye on your opponents are wrong—but I really can't say, with just the one session to judge by.

I'd play again. Until then: if I had to guess, I expect to eventually rate this at 7, and regard it as a good short filler.

Splendor is a game that I won't veto if asked to play, but it doesn't really "do it" for me.

On the plus side, the components are well done.  I love the poker chip feel and heft.  They are fun to play with on their own..... Don't look at me like that - that's not weird and I doting cause a distraction at the table :).  The cars are just a tiny bit flimsy for my taste, but they are fine for the amount you use them.  I like that the game time is pretty quick, so the game doesn't over stay it's welcome so to speak.  Lastly I like simplicity of the rules - they are easy to teach to newbies.

On the minus side, the noble goals seem "off" to me.  They are tough to get, but only worth three points.  Even with a lot of overlap of card desires, I would think it would be pretty tough to obtain multiple nobles and still win the game.  Also, some of the card costs don't seem balanced to me.  I'll be the first to admit that maybe it's me that's at fault here.  I don't claim to be a veteran player of Splendor so maybe I don't understand the reasons behind some of the choices.  That being said, some cards just seem pretty much all around better to me - you get the same effect for an easier to get combo of tiles in my opinion.  Again, maybe that's by design and there's something I'm. Not seeing, but it bugs me currently.

Good 'super filler.'  Similar in complexity/length to For Sale or Biblios.  Simple game very easy to teach.  All will understand it within a few turns of starting the game.  The components are nice (cards, noble tiles, and chips).  The goal of the game is clear and very intuitive to grasp (first to 15 point wins...but everyone needs equal # of turns).  The game starts out a little slowly (which is good for first time players), and then it really accelerates super fast near the end.  Games tend to be very close.....

It's quick.  It's fun.  It's a good game.   Recommended.

Description: Abstract, family, tableau building, open drafting, set collection, gem management game.
Number of players: 2 to 4. Best with 4.

Impression: Light, family game about buying cards and collecting gem sets from cheapest to the most expensive until the first player reaches 15 points. There is decent amount of strategy and math involved. It has very nice components, but placed in a box too large for what it is, which is purely for marketing purpose. Apart from that it is a nice filler strategy game.

Likes: Multiple viable strategies. Component quality (heavy gem chips). Quick game play.

Dislikes: First player gets a slight advantage because of the bonus tiles..

I've played this game dozens of times via the mobile app.  The physical game is much better, imo.  The social aspect (not play and pass) makes this game really shine.

This game is so smart.  The rules are so simple and the depth of strategy is amazing.  You feel so satisfied gaining a card to help your engine get you better cards later.

I honestly can't think of a single point of criticism.  This game plays fantastically with 2, 3 (best) and 4 players.

There are some clever mechanisms in this game. The problem is that, once you've learned the general strategy, it becomes little more than arduous math and luck. You will constantly be adding-up everyone's pieces to calculate their available moves, which is necessary in order to decide your own moves. Constantly.

Sure, you can try using less math and more 'gut instinct'. But then I'll beat you every time unless my card draws are unlucky.

It's a shame because the game has some great aspects. For such a small game, there are plenty of choices and different paths to victory.

I struggle with the notion of an "engine-building race" game, the game always ends right as those engines are starting to get revved. If not for the sturdy chips, it would have flown under everyone's radar - as it should. The Builders: Middle Ages has many similarities and is a much better game. Yet, having no poker chips, just flew under everybody's radar.

Although this game lacks in theme,  It  really can be a  brain burner.  The rules are simple enough but the options when to reserve cards to get gold can be really interesting but even more when to spend it  can be even more perplexing. I think this game really is a stock market type game.  You invest in a gem type based on what is laid out and hope it comes up later so you can reap the reward.  Surprising to me, how interesting this game was despite being theme less.

A simple short game. Twelve cards are available for purchase. They each have a cost in gems and each provides a discount of one gem (of a particular type) on subsequent turns as well as victory points. Players can purchase or they can acquire gems to spend on future purchases (three of different colours, two of the same, one wild). The first player to reach fifteen points wins. Its very simple, plays quickly and the game has nice components, chunky poker style chips for the gems and some very nice art on the cards.

Game needs attention right from the beginning. The beginning of the game is a bit slow, but this is only due to minding strategy. The game increasingly speeds up to the point you wish you could slow it down a bit near the end. If your strategy isn't sound at the onset, you could be in trouble.

RATING: 7
I'm really not sure what the fuss is about with this game. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game - I rated it a 6 after my first play, but upped it to a 7 after my second, seeing a bit more strategy to it that time. And we've played it fairly frequently since then. But, while I'm usually happy to play it, I don't think I'd ever request to do so. There is nothing at all original, it's just an economic snowball-type game of collecting gems to buy cards which give you more gems... 

This is a primarily tactical game, which is quick but with plenty of decisions, and which will play at least a little differently each time. Yet it feels like there's nothing here that hasn't been done before.

It's a good game, very playable - but also quite forgettable as modern releases go. I am puzzled by all the acclaim it seems to have received. (Yet at the same time I enjoy playing it, which of course is ultimately what matters.)

I realise that this is a very confusing, even schizophrenic, kind of judgement on the game - but that's genuinely how I feel. I see almost nothing here to really like - and yet I do enjoy playing it.

I've only played 3 games of this so far, but my wife and I enjoyed it so much it seemed worth giving it the 10 out of 10. Each turn you take gems (the currency of the game), buy a development card, or reserve a development card. Most of the development cards have a point value, and they also help you buy more development cards. Whomever accumulates 15 points first winds. (There are more details, but that's the gist of it). For such a simple premise, it is surprisingly engaging, and even though you only do one thing per turn, there are many factors to consider in making those decisions. So it's easy to get going and start doing things, but takes a good amount of thought to figure out how to play optimally.

If you're given the chance, definitely play a demo or check it out at your local game store if they do rentals. When a store clerk explained it to me, I wasn't necessarily sold on it. But the cards and the "gems" (plastic coins, really) are really well made. The gems have a poker chip like quality to them that's very satisfying. A game isn't all about the physical components, of course, but the easy to learn/difficult to master nature of the game, combined with the build quality make it a really satisfying game to own and play.

collecting and building up your gem resources to efficiently score future cards. Great, heavy poker chip components!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has elements that I love (like resource gathering) but really lacks player interaction. The only way you really interact with other players is to see what gems they have - then aim to take something that you knew they probably wanted. It's funny how silent games of Splendor are - there is very little game related to talk about beyond "oooh, i wanted that". Mechanics of the game are simple enough and a new player will have no problem getting stuck in after only a little explanation time.

The other thing is that three of the gem types are very similar colours for colour-blind people. While I can get around this issue by focusing on the shapes of the gems - it's either a bit of an oversight by the game developers, or the usual "we don't care about 10% of people being colour blind". My girlfriend took our set and marked every single card/piece to make the game easier for me to recognise the different gems and play.

While it is a reasonable game, mechanics wise. I'm afraid that the lack of player interaction means it would never be a go-to game for me or one I'd ever suggest playing, though I could be talked into playing if someone else really wanted to play it.

8.4.15. While I do the elegance in the design of this game, to me, the flaws outweigh the fun I have when I play this game. First the game is almost too simple for my tastes. While I don't mind simple games in general, if you couple this with an AP person, this games becomes almost unbearable. The other real issues I have is with serious vs casual players. I all my games, I got to the left of a person who watched the board and took what I needed when able. I did my best to go with what I had. The person across had a person who just kinda took what looked good. Each game that person across just killed us all. I like a game where my decisions matter to help me build up my game and are not heavily dependent on what the person before me does.

1/11/18 After more plays, this has turned out to be a better 2 player game than 4. We can both watch each other and the blocking is much better served.

It’s still our favorite after playing it at least a dozen times. It’s easy to teach, and it’s easy for a first-time player to win. And out of the two of us, the same person doesn’t win every time because the board changes. Love it! An instant classic!

RATING: 6.5
In a hobby full of pasted-on themes, it is not often that a theme is so blatantly pasted on given the apparent effort that has gone into creating 'thematic' artwork. And even then that 'theme' is a totally unimaginative and with no logical consistency that I could discern. Points off for that. If you like abstract games though, this is quite an enjoyable one - certainly more than that other abstract game, Dominion.

RATING: 6
There are some tactically interesting plays, and a little bit of strategic planning.  It was a clean and pleasing game, but ultimately pretty forgettable.  My biggest complain is that it didn't feel like there was any interaction -- the other players were just pseudo-random number generators affecting my solitaire game.  I could spend a lot of time figuring out the details of their positions in order to gain a small advantage, but that doesn't seem interesting.  Also, there is a lot of luck in what gets flipped up just before your turn -- that may average out, but it is frustrating and unsatisfying.

update: on more plays, I find the nobles to be problematic -- they over-reward infrastructure and undermine the strategic planning of aiming for high up cards.  Especially in 2p, they seem to create a dominant strategy which in turn becomes a lot about luck of the draw.

For me this game is a kind of Zen experience. After the first few times playing it it's like I don't really need to worry too much about which card to pick, sometimes there are two or three good options. Flip a mental coin and keep going. I enjoy this game and while I'd rarely offer to play it outside of my gaming group I wouldn't turn down a game. Fairly certain I'll be keeping this one for a long time to come.

Played 20+ times.  This game introduced me to strategy games as an adult.  It's a good travel game and can be easily taught to new players. Game play is tense as resource gems can become scarce and players are competing to purchase cards from the same pool.  Plays equally well with 2, 3 or 4 players.   The game's appeal is to one's competitive side since it is abstract and has light theme.

one of the wife's favorite games. 2-player is a great match of wits with clear symbology, a digestible market, open information (mostly), multiple viable avenues for victory, and a not unbearable burden of luck that keeps things fresh. plenty of moderate blocking exists, but can easily cap out and put you slightly behind if you're obnoxious. Nobles are a fun lure to encourage churn of the cheap cards or to bait out a block. 4- and 5-player is more chaotic, but becomes a press-your-luck to find a strategy that isn't overly telegraphed and/or isn't shared by another player. the fact that you CAN have a strategy in an otherwise tactical game is one of my favorite things. wonderful gateway game.

09-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. Wow, I took a long time trying to play Splendor. And now I've played it, I really like it too.

Basically, Splendor is a race. You try to buy cards, in order to get up to 15 VPs ASAP. There are always 12 open cards, 4 easy, 4 intermediate and 4 difficult (ie. expensive) ones. There are 2 basic ways to score those VPs. You can get them on the cards you buy, and you can get them from having a certain number of cards of colors depending on the tiles that are out there. There are 5 colors (blue, red, white, black, green) and yellow (wild) of resources and cards, and each bought card gives you a subsequent discount based on the jewel in the top corner. 

During your turn, you can take 3 chips of any 3 different colors, except yellow. Or you can take 2 chips of a single color if there are 4 minimum present. You can also take a yellow (wild) chip, and reserve a card you want to buy later. Reserving is possible from the of the deck, or from the display.

I like it. There is not much to it, but it's fun.

Players take on the role of gem merchants, using cards to build up mines, caravans and commerce for points. You will feel the tension and excitement when you play since it's basically a race to 15 points. Simple yet thrilling especially when your opponent leaves you that one card you need to pull off a great move. Games are usually about 10-15 minutes long so we play a best of three or best of five. I highly recommend everyone adding this game to their collection. Ours gets played a lot.

I don't know what the hype is all about.  There's really nothing innovative here at all, and the total lack of theme means it is not a good family game for my family (like Kingdom Builder, which I also don't understand the interest as a family game).  The lack of player interaction apart from taking/building a card a player wants before they can get means there's no table talk. The chips are really nice, but that's all it's got going for it.  For some reason, I kept wanting to play Augustus instead, which has a similar set collection/race to get scoring tiles, but with a much more innovative, interactive approach.

--Dec2014-- It's quite pleasant, for a little abstract game with no real theme.  Daughter #1 was amused - which is nice; and the game definitely didn't outstay its welcome.  On the other hand, it's not something I'd ever choose for its own merits:  other than the mechanical effort of playing, there's little else going on.

Quick to teach and play. A shallow game, but quite fun. Best family game of 2014. My middle daughter is a WBC Juniors champ. :)

UPDATE: I guess the "degenerate" strategy of only going after high-value cards does hurt the game. The designers surely meant this to be an engine-building race game. I'm rather good at the degenerate strategy. But I recognize that it kills the fun of those around me (particularly the fun of some of my kids, who initially really loved the game!) and so that is sad. :(

I wonder if there is a clever way to nerf this approach without harming what is a brilliant design. I don't know that even making the Nobles worth 6 points instead of 3 would make a big difference in many of the games I'm in lately!

It's set-collecting and engine-building to gain victory points with minimal thematic tie-in. It's a game which you teach as you play, so a great gateway game, but there's no bigger crescendo or excitement so the shine wears off real quick. I'd rather play a light filler with more interesting mechanics (Parade) or more interaction (Battle Line).

The beauty of Splendor is that you can play it at a funeral or viewing without disturbing anyone.  You sit very still, not saying a word, occasionally moving a card or turning in a tile on your turn.  Make sure you're not sitting next to the casket, lest other guests confuse you for the deceased.

I keep my copy with my charcoal suit and white shirt, part of my always-ready-rapid-deployment kit for being somber on short notice.

Candy Crush, the game! Perfect for grabbing the iphone generation. I hate it in theory but love it in practice. I suck so terribly at it that no matter how hard I try, my brain turns to jelly when we play and I just grab whatever mines are in front of me. Which makes it a great choice to play with my wife, since I can try as  hard as I want yet still lose every time. I don't have many games like that. THough perhaps that's just due to my anti-tactics bias. If she had a collection, it would be only games which reject long-term planning.

Anyway, it's shiny and pleasing so I bought it. 50 bucks! Ah well, bought it anyway.

Edit: Went up from a 7 to an 8.

At first I was afraid that the game gets dull after a couple of plays, but that has not been the case. The games are short enough (only played it 2 players) and the ever changing tableau forces you to adapt your strategy from game to game. The last game played for example, required a lot of white gems, but the tableau did not provide any white gems until two thirds into the game. It was very interesting to see how both players reacted to that situation.

Edit: played it 8 more times. Still enjoy every game. I attribute this to the fact, that the game is a well designed abstract. You love them or you hate them, but they never get old (feel the same about Hive and Qwirkle)

After more plays:  This isn't an "every day" game for me (TtR is for example) but I have found this to be a better game than I originally thought.  Easy to learn, easy to play, challenging and diverse.  Every time I think I have a strategy figured out it gets challenged by the way the game is playing.  Love it.


Original comment: Have played the iPad version and love it.  Finally got around to buying the physical copy.  This is actually a much better quality game then I expected (although, for the price, there still is very little to it).  My family (wife, 16 year old D and 9 year old son) all really liked it.  The play is simple to pick up but there are a number of angles gameplay can take.  I suspect it COULD get old after a while but so far we like it.

Not my style of game at all. (I prefer heavier, meatier fare). But if my group feels like they have to fill 30 minutes with a game, this is one of the few that would get my vote.

Really simple rules. Easy for anyone to get into right away. Has a nice easy feel to it. Deck memorization would help your strategy a lot, if you're into that sort of thing. Purely abstract. No theme whatsoever. Illustration is well done but unnecessary and distracting. It's odd that the counters are so overproduced (Bakelite?) while the cards seem so cheap.

Almost bought this, but then saw the size of the box. Would purchase if it came in a box a quarter of the size. Pity.

Really nice components (solid poker chip counters and good card stock) are the icing on this cake of this gem acquisition/engine building game.

When I've played, the game is, oddly, usually mostly played in silence as players plot their paths up through the three, each more expensive, levels of lovely jewels.

For as simple as this game is, it is an awesome game that uses a lot of strategy.  I have played it a dozen times, and each game is fun and entertaining.  I do recommend going past the required victory points.  I think the best games we have had went to 25 and 30.   There are a few posts and videos on this.  One suggestion was to play until all the cards were depleted.  I might try this way soon.

RATING: 6.55
5 plays under my belt and really enjoying it. The theme seems pasted on, but the artwork is great and the gem chips are awesome and weighty and definitely meant to be fidgeted with. Haven't been able to find a good strategy yet as witnessed by my 12 yr old beating me the first time he played. I tend to grab low cost cards to build an engine to get high cost cards but it seems like other players often skip this step and go right for the big points by amassing many gems and supplementing with the wild card golds to nab big points. The nobles haven't seemed to play a big part in the game as someone usually wins before there are enough cards out to be deemed worthy of a visit. This game is a definite family night hit and the stragey is deep enough to keep heavy gamers thinking and interested. A definite keeper!

I purchased this in April 2014 and I taught it as a new release game featured at LexiCon Gaming Convention in Lexington, KY on May 2014.  This is a simple but elegant engine building game with cool thick poker chip components that represent various precious gems.  The Renaissance European styled art fits the overdone "trading luxury goods in the Mediterranean region" quite nicely but the gameplay is solid and simple to teach and difficult to master.  This is a gem of a game in my collection and I hope to get it to the table many times during the holiday break.

Set collecting, card management game about collecting gems for refinement.

Pro: Components are great - poker chips, whilst unnecessary, add a great deal to the aesthetics (also they're much easier to handle than cards or wooden tokens). Gameplay is very streamlined - easy to understand, yet difficult to master. Playtime is great. Theme isn't overly present - comes across as more abstract in that regards.

Con: Suffers from analysis-paralysis sometimes.

The concept of this game is unique, and I like the idea of building up a strategy to beat your opponent. At one point in the game, you can pretty much purchase anything in the game and it becomes a bit chaotic between people, which causes the game to speed up exponentially. This can completely destroy your strategy and you can get obliterated within a few turns. Not sure if I'm a fan of that yet or not, haha. The point is, make good decisions early.

This is an easy to teach, fast-paced, exceptionally fun game that works as well for 2 as it does for 4 players. It's a great intro game for new gamers, yet has enough strategy and replayability to keep sophisticated gamers engaged. As others have pointed out the game components are quite high quality especially the heavy weight poker chip style gem tokens. Nonetheless I prefer to play my custom version with upgraded acrylic gems in the correct colors with gold coins replacing the wild tokens. This adds realism to the already fun and well illustrated jeweler theme. I've also added metal Brass coins from Eagle Gryphon Games in 1 and 5 denominations to use as scoring tokens to more easily keep track of everyone's score on the way to 15 prestige points. It makes it much easier to glance over at your opponents coins as opposed to counting card points every turn. Finally, I added the Spendor play mat to provide a logical place for all the cards and nobles, looks great and keeps the cards from sliding around on the tabletop. It's a great stand alone game you can easily complete in 20 mins, but I'd love so see some expansions for Splendor to further augment strategic options. Who's to say the noble that comes to visit your shop couldn't be enticed over to the jeweler across the street who just acquired better gems?

RATING: 1
Oh my, how this game depressed me. Somewhere in the middle I looked at my tableau, plateau thingy and went "whee, I'm snowballing". What joy.

So, firstly, there's no game in here, it's just a puzzle exercise. Secondly the game plays itself. Thirdly no theme, no dramaturgy (apart from whee snowballing), they didn't even try getting some theme that would make sense. Fourthly the graphics are terribly uninspired - like somebody just drew over photographs.

About Knizian adjective this game gets and undeservedly so. Yes, the game is simple and the tension is there, similar to Knizia's games. But there's no psychology, no tension arriving from the players, no shared space, it's a MPS. Tension is there, but what kind of tension? It's a tension you get from withdrawal symptom. Your engine is snowballing and you want just more and more and one more gem and one more card, and why did you take that, it's mine, mine, mine, precious! A friend (Martin) made a really clever comparison to game apps played on phones and tablets and such which makes sense both in what this game is and why is it liked. The tension of the game doesn't come from tense choices or risk taking, it comes from addiction. And addiction is not social, there's no common space players share here, it's just junkies grabbing their fix (I apologize if the metaphor offends anyone, it's just one that comes to mind). There's no narrative, nothing. You grab cards, more cards, more more more more and someone wins. 

t felt to me like somebody took your average MPS engine buiding euro and streamlined it by cutting off anything remotely interesting. It even feels to me like a prototype, something than would need to be properly developed. It also feels like a counterattack of engine builders against microgames - if microgames were a revolt against gaming becoming antisocial and too complicated for it's own good, Splendour is where The Empire Strikes Back. It's simple, it's micro, it's as antisocial as it gets. Of course, I do understand people liking it - if you're a gamer, like engine building games, don't care about theme or socialisation, then this is your filler. I'm totally down with that. I would just advise causal gamers to stay the hell away. 

I must say I was immensely relived when Camel Up won SdJ. 

EDIT: Lowered from 2.0 (won't play) to 1.5 (I hope nobody makes such games again)
EDIT 2 - I moved all "I hope nobody makes such games agaim" into 1.0. Hey it's the worst subjective rating I can give.

คงไม่ต้องบรรยายสรรพคุณอะไรมากสำหรับเกมที่คนเล่นบอร์ดเกมในไทยไม่ว่ามือใหม่ มือเก่า มือเก๋าคงรู้จักหรือเคยเห็นผ่านตาตามร้านบอร์ดเกมทั่วไปเป็นแน่แท้

เมื่อก่อนผมค่อนข้างจะดูถูกดูแคลนเกมนี้ไว้เยอะมาก เล่นได้1-2ครั้งก็เก็บเข้ากล่องแล้วไม่ได้แตะมันนานจนสนิมแทบจะขึ้นกล่อง แต่หลังจากได้เจอน้องคนนึงที่ชอบเล่นเกมส์นี้มากชวนเล่นตัวต่อตัวบ่อยๆ ผมกลับชอบเกมส์นี้มากขึ้นทุกครั้งที่เล่น และความรู้สึกมันคือเหมือนเล่นหมากรุกแข่งกันดีๆนี่เอง

ข้อดีคือสอนง่ายโคตรในสามโลก เอาไปสอนเด็กแปดขวบยันอาม่า70ปลายๆก็เล่นเป็นได้แบบไม่ยากเย็น แต่จะเล่นให้เก่งนั้นก็ต้องลองเล่นหลายๆรอบหน่อยถึงจะเริ่มเข้าใจวิธีการทำคะแนนที่ดีได้ 

เกมส์นี้ผมจะเป็นช้อยส์แรกๆที่จะหยิบมาสอนเพื่อนหรือคนรู้จักใหม่ๆเสมอ เวลาเล่นก็ไม่นานจนเกินไป กำลังพอดี (แต่อาจจะยืดถ้าเจอคนคิดนานๆหรือมือใหม่ที่ยังงงๆกับเกมส์อยู่)

ข้อเสียหลักๆคือ มันเป็นเกมส์ที่เหมือนอยู่ในโลกส่วนตัวของใครของมัน คู่สามีคู่นึงก่อนหยิบมาเล่นก็ดูกระหนุงกระหนิงกันดี แต่หลังจากเซตเกมเสร็จ มันเป็นเวลา30นาทีที่เหมือนอยู่ในเมืองลับแลแดนสนทยา ต่างคนก็หยิบเหรียญกันไปมาไม่มีเสียงเล็ดลอดอะไรออกมาสักแอะ คนที่ชอบเกมส์แบบมีปฎิสัมพันธ์ระหว่างเกมส์อาจจะรู้สึกเหวงๆเวลาเล่นเกมส์นี้ได้ (จะมีโอดครวญซี้ดซ้าดบ้างเวลาโดนคนอื่นจองตัดหน้าใบเป้าหมายที่ตัวเองเก็บหอมรองริบเหรียญมาอย่างยากลำบากไปต่อหน้าต่อตา --) 

ปล. ผมว่าจำนวนผู้เล่นสองคนดีที่สุดสำหรับผมละ 4คนรอนานไปนิด แถมถ้าเจอคนเล่นไม่คิดแล้วจะเอาแต่จองตัดหน้าใบที่ที่คนอื่นอยากได้(โดยไม่ได้สนคะแนนตัวเองสักนิด)จะทำสมองรวนเอาได้ง่ายๆ

Splendor takes an old-school Euro design approach (with more than a passing resemblance to [thing=9217][/thing]) and strips the gameplay down to its barest mechanisms. The engine here is simple – gems will get you cards, which in turn provide more gems to buy more cards.

However, many subtleties and nuances seem to have been lost in midst of streamlining the gameplay. Decisions here are procedural as players routinely count their number of gems, compare them to the costs of cards in the market and take the necessary gems. Sure, players have to keep an eye out for what their opponents are building up towards, but there are very limited opportunities for clever play here.

Other minor drawbacks include the potential for minor downtime as the number of purchasable cards increase towards the midgame, and luck of the draw can allow cards to fall straight into players' laps. Splendor is a solid design overall, but its calculative gameplay simply lacks verve.

I was blown away at the simplicity of Splendor. It was refreshing to see such a neat, stream-lined game become an instant hit. It didn't take long either for me to realize that the game has strategies in it that didn't jump out at me right away. This game is so accessible, I might be able to introduce it to some family members.

Splendor is a quick and easy filler game to teach and PLAY.  One game will inevitably lead to another.  On the surface, it doesn't seem like there's much to this game, but yet there is still plenty of room in it for multiple strategies and tactics to prevail.  The components are nice and the look/feel of the chips is probably the keystone to making this game work since it has NO THEME and is VERY MECHANICAL.  It was fun to play a couple times, but I don't feel the need to own it (unfortunately, the chips probably pushed the price up about $10).

I love this game. Would recommend it to anyone really. It's so simple--can teach it in less than 5 minutes. It's a great puzzle. There's no in-your-face player conflict, but will usually elicit at least one or two "screw yous" throughout the course of a game. 

My one complaint is that, thanks to its simplicity, there's no real catch-up mechanism. There's a good amount of room for error in the early game, and some options on some turns are just plain bad. It's short enough where it's not overly frustrating to lose, but you can be left out of the running with no hope of catching up at maybe the half-way point in the game.

5 színű zsetonokat gyűjtünk, azokkal 5 színű kártyákat vásárolunk, amivel még könnyebb lesz kártyákat vásárolni és ezáltal pontokat gyűjteni. Ennyi az egész játék. Igazi családi, átvezető, 5 perc szabályú. Nekem az Augustushoz hasonló élményt nyújtott kb. ugyanakkora szerencsefaktorral, viszont erős gyanúval, hogy a runaway leader probléma elég erősen jelentkezik benne. Kellene még pár parti, de úgy éreztem, hogy aki elkezdi megszerezni a nemeseket, azt nem lehet már befogni. Kicsit talán túl gyorsan is lesz vége a játéknak. Nem rossz játék a Splendor, átvezetőnek bármikor jöhet.

RATING: 9
This is the game that has hit my table most often out of all the games I bought in my first shipment (Dead of Winter, Suburbia, Sheriff of Nottingham, Biblios).  Splendor / Biblios / Bohnanza are tied for the gateway game I own that is easiest to teach to my friends, but Biblios needs at least 3 players for an exciting game, and Bohnanza hasn't aged well after over half a dozen plays.

Splendor is a great 2-player game that has gotten better the more I've played it (especially since I was destroyed in my first 4 or 5 games).

Still trying to figure out whether this game rewards skill at all or mostly luck.  I used to believe going first gives one a big advantage, though now I have seen a few players win (myself included) whether they've gone first, second, or third.

RATING: 3
I like the chips. 

Deficiencies:

* Seems like a one-strategy game (get a bunch of buying power early, buy VP late). Tactics come in in paying attention to what other people are doing/need, but...

* Paying attention to what others are doing is very important but very procedural and not very fun

* As a one-strategy game with no hidden information but some randomness, when everyone knows what they are doing, seems like the outcome will be completely luck based

this is the second game (after Ticket to Ride) that my wife really likes!  (In 4 years!)  She played it 4 times on the first sit down, and then woke up this morning and asked to play some more.  So just that gives it a high rating.

I like that it plays quite well with 2, 3, or 4.  It doesn't overstay its welcome.  It is quick but still has some interesting decisions to make.  Pleasant to look at and easy to teach.

I have only played against the computer on Android. It was as dry as a game can get. When I watched videos on how to play this game, it looks very interesting. But when actually playing it, it felt lackluster after a few games. 

Rating might change if I have a chance to play with real people.

*Played a 4 players game - it's a good optimization game, but it's just doesn't bring excitement to the table. There's no big play in this game. It's just flat from beginning to the end.

I don't think this is necessarily a 'bad' game, it just left me wanting. There is hardly a theme, and this makes it feels slapped on and not very integrated into the gameplay. That's not always a deal breaker for me, but I found Splendor to be on the boring side of things. It's just not for me.

The box volume to component ratio is an embarrassment, and the theme is disconnected if not genuinely at odds with what the game involves, but damn it if this is not a great, tense, fun, pleasing, gorgeous, clever little game. It's king of the fillers. Nuanced and maddening player interaction, hard choices between tactical necessity and strategic priority, evolving paths to victory, the winner often comes down to not having just one more turn.

Plus: the gems are wonderfully chunky and tactile. I love me some chunky tactile components.

A simple yet decent game where you're basically collecting and making matches to take tiles that allow you to collect more tiles.

RATING: 6.5
2 plays.

This is a fun little filler with some gem-related theme pasted on. Basically, though, it's a game of set collection where you're racing to score 15 VP to trigger the end of the game (equal turns) and likely win the game. 

The 3 decks of cards have gems with various costs in other gems. On your turn, either collect poker chips (3 different ones, or 2 of one color as long as you leave at least 2 behind) or claim a card from the display by paying it's cost in gems. Cards you collect remain face up in your display, and act as discounts (essentially, virtual poker chips). OR, you can reserve a card from the display, adding it to your hand and taking one gold chip (acts as a wild color chip). At the start of the game, several bonus tiles were randomly selected; these show particular card combinations. At the end of your turn, if you have any of these combos, you may claim 1 tile. These tiles, and many of the cards, are worth VP; if anyone gets to 15+ VP, finish the current round (even turns): the player with the most VP wins.

It's kind of a cool little game that plays quickly (30-45 minutes) and has some decisions to make without taxing your brain too much. You have to pay attention to what other people are collecting towards, so you can snake those cards/tiles away from them!

Fine. Nice components. A slightly different theme than medevil merchants ... oh, no, not really, but the theme hardly matter, this is a set collection game, with some power ups that make it more interesting than ... well, tan ticket to ride. But this is a shorter, less strategic game than ticket to ride, or so I am told, I've played ticket to ride, and Splendor seems to have more going for it.

RATING: 6
This is an extremely simple and quick filler.  At the start of the game there are 3 rows of gems of increasing cost.  Some give you points (more at higher cost) and they all give you gem production.  Each turn a player selects three different colored gems (or 2 of one color if none are claimed yet), stores a card to be built later and acquires a wild gem, or pays the cost to build a card.  There are also goal tiles worth 3 points each that are acquired when a player builds a certain number of cards of specific gem colors.  This continues until one player gets 15+ points, then the other player gets one final turn to match or beat that score.

For what it is, this game's simplicity doesn't bother me.  It is easy to teach to almost anyone, plays quickly, and is somewhat intriguing.  What really hurts it for me though is the extreme amount of luck that can just ruin a play for someone.  When a card is bought another is flipped over immediately and after the first couple turns those may be automatically acquired by a player if it flips over at the start of their turn.  This way one player may never see the gems they need while the other acquires all the ones they do potentially for free.  I've played this game twice and this happened to me both times, once to an extremely bad degree as each row of 4 cards had 3 of one particular unneeded gem color in them and my opponent constantly got the needed missing colors at the start of his turn free of charge.

If it weren't for that this would be an extremely charming and easy filler.  But I just can't abide being beat by luck every time no matter how well I play.  I wouldn't get much enjoyment out of winning that way either.  The poker chips that come in the game are nice though.

Excellent fast game. The rules are simple, you don't take too long to explain to the players.
I takes 30 mn to 1 hour to play, it's relatively fast.
It's also an addictive game, you want to play again and again.
The artwork is good, it's a real pleasure to manipulate those poker-pawns-like used for the gems.

High recommandation for 2-4 players, fast setup and game length, interesting strategies, bright balance between strategy and randomness.

I liked it but I am not sure I would ever love this. It has some things going I am often drawn to in games: not too long, easy to learn and pick up, on the downside I don't think it offers so much hidden depth as some of these "easy" games can do. It was fun but stayed a bit too much on the surface for me. A plus point is though that you can put this literally in front of anybody and they will likely have a decent time with it: gamers will enjoy it as a filler, the rest of the family will also have fun since it is a simple yet fun experience; we just played it with a 6-year old on the team who did just fine. Like it enough to be happy to play, not enough love to consider owning it.

Get rich or die getting slightly less rich!  I think Splendor's mechanics are top notch - letting your opponent take a few turns saving up chips for a card and then nabbing the card under their nose is a great feeling.  There's also enough randomness to make it possible to recover from a few bad investments - squirreling away mines for a gem that isn't well represented NOW might come in handy later when that gem is in high demand.  The theme of the game is pretty thin, which is a complaint that Asmodee seems to have addressed in the app version.  It would also be nice to have variable player powers.  I think its a solid chip collecting/card collecting game.  An imperfect gem that still shines.

Splendor is a game that came out of nowhere and all of a sudden took the world of board gaming by storm, and for a while, many was certain it would even win the Spiel des Jahres (it didn't). In this game, players are competing to build the most efficient gemstone output. This is done by acquiring gemstones from a common pool (which thematically makes no sense at all) and using these to acquire mines, gemstone experts and other vital elements of the gemstone industry. As the game is both fast paced and stupendously easy to teach, it is a fine filler game. In by itself, however, it is nothing more than a mediocre card game.

Very nice set collection game. The rules are so simple than it leaves one wondering why this hasn't been done before.

The game is so straightforward that I may enjoy the game more than it actually deserves. But although the rules are dead easy, deciding what to do is hardly ever simple. The game constantly seduces you to pick the cheap cards, but at one point you should defenitely skip a few turns to save for the big points. You're constantly reminded that turns are a resource just as the jewels are.

All that, and it's great with two. This will get ten plays in no-time.

This game is a lot of fun, though not quite as great as I expected from the hype around it. It is easy to pick up, teach, and play, which is great. I thought the strategy would be a bit more interesting and lead to tough decisions and fun conflict between players, but there really does seem to be an ideal way to use each turn, and very little happens between players. But, oddly enough, I find this game relaxing. You can be introverted in a group while playing it and not feel stressed. So, it's not what I expected, but I like what it is.

Tableau and engine building gameplay; I love the physical nature of taking the gems, and the satisfying clink of placing them back in order to take the cards.  The engine building element accelerates as the game moves towards the end, so that it winds up as a mad race towards the finish.  I especially like the ability to claim a card and take a wild, or when there really is nothing that helps, taking a blind card and trying to achieve it.

I don't think I had a single hard choice during my game. Play a card if you can; collect gem if you can not; on special occasion reserve a card. Theme, gameplay and interaction are all pretty dull.

RATING: 8
Huh.  Maybe I should give more credit to the board game popularity awards, 'cause this is actually a really good little game.  This is basically the most stripped-down version of an "economic engine building" game that one could possibly create, yet it works (it works really well, in fact!).  And though it is a simple game, it moves along at a good clip and doesn't overstay its welcome.  The physical components are top notch: besides the obviously satisfying chunky chips, all the cards are lavishly illustrated, helping the players to remember what the completely unimportant theme of the game is.  The game box should have been much smaller, but that's the only real complaint I can drum up.  So I will just say that this is a splendidly fun and clever game, and leave off with that groaner.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

Elegant abstract filler distills engine-building to its basest level: on a turn, collect gem tokens or spend gem tokens to purchase a gem card. Each gem card you have counts as a gem token of that type for future purchases, so players' buying power rapidly ramps up. Expensive cards are also worth points; first to 15 wins.

A very smooth, elegant design, not too heavy but with some thought required. Quite a bit of randomness: it is frustrating seeing useful, cheap cards turn up right before another player's turn.

RATING: 6.5
I'm not that big into games without a social component of player interaction and this game does that quite a bit. Otherwise social people tend to just stare at the offer and contemplate in silence. Is it rewarding? Sure. Is it why I play board games? No. Also, the box this thing comes in is WAAAAY bigger than it should be.

Perfect weekday game to play side-by-side together on the couch. Don't need to hide any info, small table space, quick setup time, quick play time, and enough strategy/tactics without making your head ache.

Just a perfectly satisfying way to board game after a day at work.

Update: Introduced game to my Mum, she really liked it and caught on fast. So...really good with non-gamers too!

RATING: 7
I'm appreciating Splendor more in hindsight.  The game starts at the granular level.  You start picking up chips in different colors, value 1 each, to be used for buying cards.  Cards come out from shuffled decks into a public array, each one a little contract to fulfill -- maybe 3 reds and a white to get a cheap card, but something like 7 blues and 3 blacks to get a card worth 4 or 5 victory points.  Credit alert, though, because even the cheapest cards count as value 1 of a particular color, for unlimited reuse on all further buys!  So you start with the cheapest cards to improve your buying power, but the game is really pretty short so you don't want to wait too long to transition to buying the cards worth VP.  The flow is very smooth and I believe the game will repay repeated play.

Eh... quick abstract game that supports multiple people and is fairly interesting. I find that it is a bit too dry and straight forward for my tastes.

The only hit on this game is its complexity, but that is also the reason I love the game.

Very simple rules, very quick turns and very short games.  I enjoy playing this one with my wife quite a bit.  It is great when i get home from work or we are both tired and don't want to think too hard, but the game does have enough meat to keep it intriguing.  We normally play a several games back to back.

As first mentioned, I normally enjoy more complicated games, but take this game for what it is, and it is wonderful.

Laura's Rank (3/15) – 3.5 out of 5. Pros: Super easy to learn. Quick play, which is good in certain situations. Every game is somewhat different based on what cards come out. It is high strategy. Can get exciting towards the end as players are getting close. Cons: Low player interaction. The theme falls flat. It's much more about the mechanic (which is good), so there is not really any theme. Jewels instead of money is good, but not a strong theme at all.

Ryan's Rank (3/15) – 4 out of 5. This is a great filler. Short, a good balance of strategy. Great components. Our last few games where we both understood the strategy well was really fun. Even though I lost, I enjoyed the game and didn't feel like I'd sunk hours into something I was terrible at. I'll bring it out often.

An engine building mechanic that has a wafer thin/non existent theme but is pimped out with lovely tactile pieces (nice art on the cards and chunky poker chips) that seemed so dry and unpromising at first but...... turned out to be very strangely addictive. Emma and I played 8 games over three consecutive nights. Victories are evenly split so far but the game just calls out for one more play each time you finish and that is quite a rare thing for us to do so it is obviously pushing some right buttons.

Splendor is personally my favorite game. It's a thoughtful, quiet playthrough so it's kind of ironic that it's my favorite, as I'm a talkative player. But something about this game just makes me really happy. Essentially, you're collecting and growing a gem collection in order to attract a noble. It's 100% engine building. I don't typically love engine building, but I think because that's all Splendor is it's more approachable and appealing to me

I usually don't hypes in the board game universe. And again I don't get it with this game. Now as with most hypes, the game is quite good, but in my opinion it is not hype worthy.
The rules are simple and of the kind you find in [thing=68448][/thing] or [thing=36218][/thing]: extremely limited options but the cards give the game more depth. But maybe not as much as in those other games. The resource chips are a nice idea that works fine but nothing spectacular.
In fact everything in this game is perfectly fine and nothing is ground breaking. I like it, I don't love it.

RATING: 5
Very light, fairly quick game.  Not much in the way of design.  There's not a whole lot going on.  But this card to buy that card to build your engine to buy future cards.

There's a small amount of hosage with one of the actions.  But the game is pretty dry. 

At least it's fast.  I'll probably play it a time or two, but really there's not much here.  I only bought it cuz it was cheap and had good reviews as a gateway.  I guess I just don't like gateways.

RATING: 5.9
It plays fine, but the lack of theme while having a theme artificially stuck onto it is almost grotesque.
It's basically a pure and abstract resource ramp game. Nothing more!

+ simple rules and short 
- very abstract
- The theme is not there.
- heavily card-based (sleeves necessary)
- no fun
- box very oversized

It's odd that not all color combinations are equally supported. Knowing the supported color combinations gives an advantage.

2 player game plays quite different than multiplayer. There's a lot more hoarding and blocking possible than with more players.

Played it for the first time tonight.  Played 3 rounds.  Definitely fun.  Has a bit of a slow start and frustration when you're blocked from getting cards you want at the start and everyone's grabbing resources, but once things slowly unfold and the gem stock is replenished it starts to flow better.

I can see this not being a game I'd want to play with people who suffer from Analysis Paralysis.  I think it might lower in rank slightly (maybe to 8.6 or 8.4)after more plays, but for now it's fun. :)

Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops—all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.

Really enjoyed the game play, theme, art, quick set up, and ease of playing/teaching.  I like the replay-ability of it because there are different strategies, and different starting cards can alter how you play.  I enjoy the "reserving" a card aspect because it can benefit you, or simply can ruin the other player's plans.  Fun game!  Oh, and LOVE the tokens.  The extra weight (like poker chips) gives the components a great quality feel to them.

Simple rules make this a great intro for new gamers, but the depth of strategy and slight randomness in cards keep it fresh and engaging for experienced players. Brutally short whether the game ends in a close race or a total stomping. I've played with three and four players, and each game was over in 40 minutes or less (one game lasted all of about 10 minutes). Little room for error. Beautiful gem pieces and development cards, very satisfying to watch your development engine grow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Understandable, easy to play, somewhat not engaging. The problem is knowing when to stop collecting "free gems" and start working for points. Unlike St. Pete, with a clear time to switch to point, Splendor has an indefinite time, determined by random factors and opponent play.

This is a great game, made greater by its simplicity.  I am going to need to play it more to finally decide on a rating, but my one concern thus far is that the start of the game seems entirely about getting basic cards which gain you early game resources rather than grabbing high point cards.  It just seems weird the game wouldn't make it strategically interesting by adding benefits and disadvantages to each strategy of picking various valued cards.

Despite this annoyance, the idea of the game, the quality, the simplicity, wow just wow.  If it wasn't for my concern about boring opening gameplay this might score a 10, as it is, I may very well end up lowering this to an 8 or even 7 depending on how horrible early gameplay is on my subsequent plays.

Nice components and art wasted on a very simple game. There are some very simplistic decisions to be made and you can't completely ignore your opponents, but saying this is tactical or has take that is a stretch. 

I was hoping for a light and attractive game I could introduce to family and non-gamer friends that would be at least a little addictive to play. I just got an attractive game. I feel no urge to play this nor do I feel an urge to introduce this game to potential gamers. To put it in one word: meh.

RATING: 9
This is the heaviest played game in our house.   Everyone loves it.   I love it.   One of my favorite games ever.   It strikes a balance few games have.

It plays quickly, is easy to explain the rules, and is just a FUN game from there on.

This has been updated to be my favorite game from a point of YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF YOUR FATE in the game.... no dice, just your tactics, win and it is very satisfying!  Lose and it's really your own fault! 

Ignore the reviews that say one strategy wins you the game, it's not true.   There are plenty of ways to win.  

It has a balance I have not really seen in games, a major hit for us, couldn't be more happy.   Hope they make expansions!   The only reason I'll ding it a bit is the cards themselves are pretty cheap stock, definately need sleeves. Compared to the chips which I'll comment on below.

Another thing, this game comes with the best organizer insert of any game I've personally purchased.   Everything has its place and the "Gem... Poker Chips" are made of some very heavy plastic stock as in Casinos.   

Buy it you won't regret it.

UPDATE: The only flaw I found in the well designed organizer is that once the cards are sleeved they don't fit well at all any longer.

Easy to learn, but still some good amount of complexity in the game.
The artwork is very nice and the games are very intense.
Some would say that there is not enough interactions between players, but i think that after a few games, players start to watch better what others are trying to do. This results in more counter action (by buying the cards he wants or simply by locking a card).
I'd also say they miss estimated the time play as it's more 45 min to 60 min games with 3-4 players.

I played 3 games and it was always a great experience.

RATING: 6
ANOTHER UPDATE: This one is a solid 6. With more play, I've gotten quite good at the game, but it's just too dry. I've basically circled 'round to my original opinion. Oh well!

---

UPDATE: Yes, it's a snowball, but after playing the game with another new player (my first few plays were with experienced and well practiced players), I enjoy it much, much more. I had a little extra breathing room to figure out what to do and how to do it. I now gladly play, and I can see my rating moving up to an 8. Time will tell.

---

Interesting. Lovely components. But ultimately a bit too straightforward. It's a race to create an economic snowball. The card reservation mechanic saves the game from being too chaotic in a multi-player setting, but, to be honest, I'm worried Splendor is just a bit, well, boring.

This game can be played light or heavy with newbies or exceptionally strategic players, and is a near perfect game. Can be explained in less than 5 minutes, has tons of replayability and strategy. The artwork is good (not great, and the theme is okay but not great, which is the only and minor flaw in the game for me. The mechanic is pretty seamless and the game shouldn't bog down unless you've got someone who can't decide frequently. One of the things I've noticed is that while playing, we're pretty silent. Playing quickly is great but a lot of thinking is required, which limits social interaction. It's one of the great things about this game, but may turn some people off. The components are great, especially the tokens. I happen to love it!

I guess the best thing I can say about Splendor is that I don't really have anything bad to say about it. It isn't a game that grabs me with its amazing mechanics, but it is fun to play, quick, easy to teach and learn and has a lot of replayability. It's got a nice, simple engine building system as basically you collect resources to buy cards to help you buy other cards. I'm interested in trying the expansion, but really it's an elegant game that I feel doesn't really need to be tampered with.

For now, I have to compare it to how I loved some games like Lost Cities and Jaipur. Those games are similar where you mostly play your cards in a solitaire way and look great. They just are a little more interactive for me and more importantly came at a different time in a game cycle. So I think. But then again, the interactivity between players is so much more palpable in those games and in many more of my favorites and not here.

I love the strategy articles I read through. Someone did the color wheel research that I suspected. 

I had not developed a strong picture of a tier 3 strategy but it sounds very strong!

A little bit of theme would help. For me, the game is constantly checking abstract cards for costs and use and trying to grab nameless resources to be able to buy a good one. Took me way too long to make a turn for such a simple game. When I play Agricola, I know what a baking strategy is and get what it does intuitively due to the theme. This does not work at all for Splendor.

A fairly straightforward engine builder, but I find it gripping. This is not multiplayer solo, and keeping an eye on the opponents strategy is vital. Can often be a quiet game with little talk at the table.  Of course, the theme is unnecessary. And I love playing with those chips.

I don't quite know what time this game would be best suited for. For a filler it's a little too puzzly. With all the options there is quite a big chance for overanalysation which in return makes the game stay past its welcome. And as a starter of a gamenight it would be too shallow for my taste. So this game, while not bad at all and with pleasant artwork, hits the opposite of a sweet spot for me.

What a great game. Very simple to play and I can see this leading the next generation of gateway games.

The feel of the game reminds me of Saint Petersberg: on your turn you can buy a card from a face-up selection of cards, take a card into your hand to play later, or collect gems (which are used to buy more cards). The cards you buy will accumulate and make it cheaper for you to buy other cards in the future.

On top of the simplicity, a game takes maybe 30 minutes, putting this into super-filler territory. There's a good amount of things to think about, though, and there's just enough player interaction though indirect. The player interaction is in the form of deciding which cards to take (to deny your opponents), taking gems that your opponents could possibly use (the gem supply is limited), and a race to collect certain cards to get a bonus in the form of nobles. You usually have a few different options each turn, so being blocked in one area isn't devastating like it is in some games. Euro gamers should appreciate this sort of indirect interaction.

My only complaint is the amount of luck in the game. A player can get lucky when someone buys a card then the new card that comes out is one that can be bought immediately by someone else who happens to have the right cards/gems in front of them. This can even decide the game in the final rounds.
For example, I was the start player in a game and, near the end of the game, on my turn I could see that based on the available cards nobody would be able to buy any of more valuable cards. So I reserved a four-point card, planning to play it in the next round to put me over 15 points. But the replacement card that came out was another four-point card that matched up perfectly with the gems that the next player already had. That player bought the card, got more than 15 points, and won the game.

Extremely elegant and a lot of fun, although a bit luck-based.

Sold.

This is a great game for a specific niche.  It's easy to play for people who are not big on table top games, or kids who can't handle a lot of complexity; so when Grandma comes over, everyone can play and still have fun.  It is also short enough but still interesting that we can pull it out for a quick gaming fix.  It's not terribly deep or involved but it stays fun enough to play occasionally when you don't have time for something better or don't have people who will enjoy more complex games.  Basically lite and easy enough for a smart 6, 7, or 8 year old, without getting too boring for the adult game lovers.  But for that specific niche, it's dang near perfect.

RATING: 7.5
Good little resource-management game. Quick-playing and easy to learn. I found it surprisingly tactical for a game that relies heavily on random card flips. The card-reserve mechanic adds a nice bit of tension to the overall game, and makes every turn a tough decisions since you can do it at any time (barring the 3-card hand limit). I recommend this game for families, and groups interested in a light-weight, fast-playing game that looks good and teaches easy.


The tension in game play surfaces after only a few plays. Get through the first two and you'll discover a delightful game. However, my gut tells me it will start to feel a it samey after a dozen or so plays; maybe less. I'll update after a few more plays (currently at 4).

Fantastic game played it all the time when it first came out. Haven't picked it up in a while but it's one of those games that is great for both old and new gamers alike, easy to teach but with a so much depth. Plus it's beautifully presented.

Very little luck involved and mostly just strategy to get those nobles.

UPDATE (8 -> 4):
I grew pretty bored with it and just didn't want to even look at it any longer, so I sold it.
It desperately needs some type of expansion or house rule to make it interesting after a while.

I actually wavered a bit on making this the first game that I have given a 10 to. But eventually went down to a 9. The poker chips were a great idea to add some character to a basically themeless game. I'm usually not a component guy, but I just love stacking up the coins here. I enjoy while there are often some obvious first plays to make I've still found many different paths to victory here. Scaling perfectly from 2-4 is also an incredibly great boon for any game in my book.

Very addictive set collection game. Plays very quickly, (once you all know what your doing games rarely last more than 10 - 15 mins). Components are of good quality, although the size of the box is an issue, a smaller box would make a perfect travel filler. I also have Spice Road which offers more options, but find I still have room for Splendor in my collection due to its shorter game times. Very well polished game, & an absolute joy to teach new players.

Wife and Daughter had the ease of play with this one. I just couldn't find a strategy that worked but the tension around the table was magnificent. We were all in the game and that was fun. Can slow down with chip hoarding, especially early on. There were a couple of times I felt like I couldn't play because everyone else had the chips and weren't buying. The strategy paid off though.

RATING: 9
This is one of my personal favorites. Marc Andre captures a mechanic, makes it as clean and simple as possible and turns it into a great game with high quality components.

Take coins (gems), spend them on cards that grant you more gems, and use your new bank of gems to purchase high level cards and eventually obtain enough victory points to win the game.

If you enjoy resource managment and card driven gameplay, this is a must have. Ive played this with up to 4 players and it scales beautifully. A must own for any collection!

This is the first modern board game I bought. The purchase was mainly because my wife enjoyed the gameplay a lot, the free version (prestige) on android had been on our phones for months.

But as I learned to properly evaluate the board by ranking all chips by their "point potential" the game started to be more fun and competitive.

Fun light engine building game. Really easy to teach to new and seasoned gamers alike. You can definitely see why it was a nominee for the Spiel this year.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The winning strategy seems to be to horde resources until you get a visit from a noble then start purchasing tiles. The biggest issue with the game for me is that the first player have an obvious advantage against others when employing the above strategy. Basically, this game is relatively easy to play, which is not my style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple, maybe elegant, design and components. I played 2 games with four players and it was enjoyable and light. However resources get scarce at 4 players and thus a win comes down to more luck (or so it seemed) than strategy.

RATING: 6
Fun game, but I did not really think strategically and still almost won. On second play, was in a 3 way tie for second with very bad pay. I am not sure if it speaks to my luck, the poor quality of my opponents, the chaos of a 4 player game, or just the game being too light.

Overall, I did not really get all that into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What I like:

-It's beautiful! So beautiful! I have no doubt in my mind that this is actually a huge factor in it's success - the chips and card are just a treat to look at. 
-It's so fast and fun. Easy to teach. Hits a great sweet spot where everyone can learn and play this quickly, and even win, but clever thinking is still going to be rewarded. 
-It's just as fun with 2 as 4 players. 

What I dislike:
I guess in the long run the same advantage that the game has could become it's eventual downfall for you - if you play this a ridiculous amoung of times it might become a little repetitive as the game is so simple as it is.

I have resisted this game for a long time.  No need to go into a canonical list of the reasons why (pasted on theme, clinically cold game components) as they have been documented for as long as this game as been in publication.

With all of its flaws, it is an addictive little engine builder. The rules are so straightforward and simple, this is an ideal gateway game to introduce engine builders to new gamers(don't try with, say, Terraforming Mars). Where many gateway games wear themselves out quickly, Splendor holds your interest - who doesn't like a quick race to the 15 points unless the gems you need never come up for purchase.

Splendor isn't a game that I knew anything about specifically, other than that it was a light, quick game that "didn't really do much new". And that's all true. But I like this game. You take chips to buy gems which give you discounts on other gems, and eventually you buy gems that are actually worth something and/or attract some person of note who is also worth something. The game is fairly simple, but requires a constant evaluation of what's important and what people are trying to do. You've got to think about what's going on a good bit. It's a lot of thinky in a very small package and it's quick. And despite being thinky, it's a game my family could play and enjoy. That's a fairly rare combination.

[thing=148228][/thing] is a light set collection type of game. In your turn you have a small set of options:
- take two chips of the same color (if there are at least 4 chips in the stack);
- take 3 chips, all of different colors;
- take one card from the rows and one gold chip (maximum of three cards separated - you must always pay the cost of these cards, you can't just put them back in the rows);
- pay the cost of one card and put it in front of you.

The cards are divided in three rows, accordingly to the amount of chips necessarry to build them. The less chips, the easier to pay its costs. Every card will have the kind of chips necessary to pay for it, and also will have a type of precious stone - once you take it, the cost of that type of color will reduce in one. So, for example, if the card you took has 1 green gem on it, the next time you will pay for some card that needs green, you will pay one less (up to zero).

Some of the cards are worth victory points, and also there are nobles, which are worth 3 points and require a set of colors to "visit" the first player that complete the set. The game ends when someone reaches 15 points, when this happen, the players will finish the round of play so that everyone has had the same number of turns. The winner will be the player with the most points.

As one can see, [thing=148228][/thing] is a game that can be explained in few minutes and played by anyone that grasped games like [thing=9209][/thing], beign as light as this one. And it plays even faster: usually you will have your turn figure out way before the game returns to you. When we played, one AP player was always surprise to see that the play had already returned to him. Even with this, we played the whole game in around 40 minutes. I won't be surprise at all if the plays, once everyone has the flow of the game set in, will last around only 30 minutes.

It is an easy going game, with some indirect confrontation (I can take a card I see you want to take, or I can hold chips of one color in order to prevent, for some time, other to build cards of that color), nothing major, so, even if you play with family or players that dislike confront, they will probably still enjoy [thing=148228][/thing].

The game has some luck in its play: for instance, if you take several cards that lower the cost one, say white (diamonds) cards, and the ones that are worth points requiring a high number of white don't show up, well... So it is best, as far as I can see, the spread your options, taking, at least in the beginning, cards of almost every color, in order to be somewhat prepare for everything that shows up later. Even with luck, usually the player that played the best will win - something that is always great.

As it was said many time, [thing=148228][/thing] has some [b]awesome[/b] chips - they are sturdy, heavy - a friend of mine thought they were made of metal (but no). Yes, the box is huge for what comes inside, but everything stay in its place, the cards fit even when sleeved (a major plus for me) - so I can't complain about the box. The cards are OK and the noble tiles are thick. Overall, an excellent production value - it makes well worth the price of it (which isn't cheap, considering the game doesn't came with a big lot of components).

So, [thing=148228][/thing] has proven itself as a great option of filler, giving several things to consider in every turn, but none of them overwhelmingly hard nor requiring several minutes of ponderation. It isn't as portable as, say, [thing=172][/thing], nor it accepts as many players as [thing=37759][/thing], but it is a heavier than both, and it will probably be a good choice for players that want more meat in their fillers.

Recommended!

RATING: 5.5
Kind of pleasant. Some denial tactics are possible but not usually worth the effort to evaluate. So, the game seems to be about deciding when to switch from engine-building to scoring, although those two things aren't really that separate. I'm curious to what extent other players' strategy affects one's own ideal strategy: If there's a single best approach to timing then there won't be a lot of game here.

Wow. I did NOT expect this game to knock my socks off, but it did. I love an "elegant" simple rule set, but I also love a good theme. I was worried this one would be too dry (both for me and my wife) and too simplistic.

But instead, it is that rare game that takes a simple concept and plays it too perfection. The decisions you make are "simple" yet agonizing. The interaction is indirect yet always there. The drive to the end is intoxicating. Playing again is addicting... in short, this is a very, very good game. Thrilled!

This game is probably the single biggest reason that Ticket to Ride doesn't make it to the table as much anymore. It's a little faster and hits pretty much all the same buttons for me. It's a super elegant design. Simple rules, but a lot of choices to make. As soon as you start playing, brains start dissolving. Yes, it's a bit of a conversation killer. But it's the best kind of quiet game experience. And, if you need to really challenge yourself, just try to tell a story while playing. It'll prove to you that multi-tasking is just doing multiple things poorly.

2P can move atquite a clip, but that's the best thing about this dumb, obvious, point-salad of a game.  About 3 seconds of tension per 20-min game, so I'll give it a rating of [BGCOLOR=#FF6699] [b]3[/b] [/BGCOLOR].

Good:
-Perfect gateway game
-Elegant game design
-Amazingly simple to explain
-Only one action per turn makes decision making easy
-You get significantly better after multiple plays
-Great components
-Cards are well balanced
-Leaves people wanting more
-Not as luck based as it appears
-Multiple paths to victory

Bad:
-While rare, luck can hand a player the victory
-At times, you wish it was a grander game
-Can run long if everyone is only going after level-1 cards
-Really needs an expansion

Overall:
This is likely the best gateway game on the market.  Almost always a hit and, due to its simple rules, players can quickly into the game without feeling overwhelmed.  After the first few turns, you will start to hear new players have their epiphanies when they start to see the bigger strategy.  This is the perfect litmus to determine if the people you coerced into playing one game with you are interested in playing more strategy games.  The game teeters on being a filler game because of its length but is too deep for that label.  The reserve mechanic allows this game to have significant strategic depth that is often missed by its critics.

This game. 
It makes me itchy. 

I have played it countless times and I do not tire of it. Worthy of all praise and maybe even some criticism. 

Worth trying, as it is not all hype. This game seriously works well with players of varying skill. The only thing that I find hard to explain to new players is the Gold mechanic. It is not intuitive to me. It makes prefect sense once you do it, and it isn't a complicated concept, it is just often met with a confused expression. 

Get it. Play it. Share the itchy love.

Easy to play euro game with very little downtime and only a few rules to teach. Still offers quite a decent amount of turn angst though - even as a two player game. The theme and artwork are pretty generic and unremarkable, but the quality of the components (especially of the hefty chips!) is very good. My type of medium filler - tactical, but not entirely without strategy...like it a lot! And it also scales very well.

Yes, Splendor is a simple exercise in resource management. You buy A to give you X, You buy B to give you Y, etc. Then use X and Y to buy C. That is it. There aren't even many ways to win prestige points. Just those that are being printed on the resource cards as well as nobles. First player to reach 15 prestige points triggers the last round and the game ends. Most points win. Simple, straightforward, no chrome.

Yet, after a few plays, the game stands out for its simplicity distilled down to the bare essence that is resource management. In a way, I find this refreshing. The resource generation in Splendor is not unlike 7 wonders minus the drafting. But think of 7 wonders and I shudder at explaining all the ways points are accumulated in the game. It is just so much chrome tacked on the basic game play. Splendor is almost the antithesis of 7 wonders. 

Still, this game will find only a smaller audience. Folks who eschew lengthy rules, want a simple game without messy explanations and fast game play. When those folks are around, I shall reach for Splendor and....Caveman Curling.

Great game- it's fun to build your engine.  My biggest beef with the game is that it favors the aggressive player who only go after the big point cards.  you have to watch for someone who is trying that strategy because if you don't purposely stop them, they will walk away with the win.  I wish the game better rewarded the player who buys mainly 0 point cards.

After watching a video review of this game my reaction was "That's it? How in the world is this such a great game?" However, when I played it, I found it to be an addictive filler game with plenty of interesting choices. Distills engine building down to its core. This is one of those games that makes you think "How has this not been done before?"

Neat game - it gives you that feeling of 'My engine just started to get going and then the game was over' - but AP possibilties are very high in this one, too high for it to be a game that I would choose to play often.

Very well designed game where you collect gems and purchase cards which in turn help you build your wealth even faster. Some cards award points and once you collect specific combinations of gems, you can receive a "noble" card, bringing even more points.  The game accelerates quickly and ends when one player accumulates 15 points. Scales well to 2 players. This game is simple, plays quick, and always leaves me wanting more.

Pros: gateway game, set collection, easy to learn, no reading required, variable strategies, variable initial set-up, quick playtime, high level of replayability

Cons: no direct player interaction, no theme

This hits all the right requisites for a fun gateway game: thin rulebook, no reading necessary for gameplay, good components, low complexity yet different strategies, and just the right amount of luck. Strategy changes with the number of players too, so I feel that that combined with the variable setup means there's a good deal of replayability. The only downside I see is that it is such a quiet game--I like to have more player interaction.

RATING: 10
The perfect mix of balance in what cards cost and different ways to gain significant points from controlling nobles or going for tier 3 cards.  This game never plays out quite the same way and while some "strategies" might appear to be dominant (I have heard players at gaming clubs talking about this) they are absolutely not dominant their opponents just do not know how to adjust to what other players are doing.  I have general tactics for my early game that rarely change very much depending on the options but I never play the end game one specific way "because it is the dominant strategy".  I have an absurd win rate for a game like this by tactically keeping track of everything each player is doing and the mathematical value of all my turn options.  To achieve this win rate I have to constantly be willing to change my planned turn and to not be relying on no one trying to stop my best visible options by reserving a card or two.  Even when everyone at the table is aware I am the biggest threat and try to conspire against me this game rewards careful decision making.  Luck can occasionally dominate an entire game and make a win "nearly impossible" but 80% of games will go to the player who made the best decisions.

RATING: 10
This is an all-around fun game: it has a lot of luck, but just enough strategy to make it interesting, such as wasting a move to reserve a key card at the right time. It's short (20-30 minutes); the cards and chips have a beautiful design and feel to them; and the game is simple and has only a few rules. I'd say it's my very favorite short game, but it's just robust enough to not really be a filler game. The rules can be taught quickly and the game can be mostly understood on the first try playing the game. And it works just as well with only 2 players as it does with 3 or 4, which makes it double as a challenging 2 player game as well, which is rare for multi-player board games.

Official game description: As a wealthy Renaissance merchant, acquire mines and transportation, hire artisans and woo the nobility. Create the most fantastic jewelry to become the best-known merchant of them all! Acquire precious stones to trade them for development cards. Use development cards to acquire more gem stones. Use your gems and gold to create the most fantastic jewelry, and appeal to the nobles to gain the prestige you need to win.

Oct 2017: 
I have a lot of great things to say about this game.  It is ALWAYS the first game I recommend to someone who wants to get a non-gamer into gaming.  Why?  Because it doesn't feel too much like a gamer's game.  It's not too heavy, it doesn't have any "weird" themes, and the cards don't feel too much different from a normal set of cards.  It's a step beyond Lost Cities, which is still just a card game, but not quite a Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne.  Everyone we've introduced to games with this has enjoyed it and quickly mastered it enough to be competitive.   We, personally, don't play it much if we aren't playing with non-gamers, but I can still recognize that this game is one that belongs in basically every collection.  I also feel like it does shine at 3-4P, while we are usually stuck with only 2P.  (Really hoping to see the expansion make this more replayable for us, though.)

Original, Dec 2016:
Not my favorite game, but is definitely in or near my top 10 list!  This game is perfect in many ways, even if it's not *my* favorite.  What makes it great?

* Rules are quick and easy to learn.  Perfect gateway game that works well even with people who only play "traditional card games".
* Set-up is fast.
* It takes just the right amount of time to play, not dragging on too long or being too short.
* There is a bit of a luck factor (especially coming to turn order sometimes), but it's also "thinky" enough to keep me interested in playing multiple rounds in a row.
* Beautiful artwork.  While the theme doesn't really play across strongly (it just feels like a card game with pretty art), I don't consider that a flaw.  It makes it more appealing to people who are generally against any sort of board game.
* Slightly different each time depending on what nobles you draw and what cards are turned over.  The same strategy doesn't *always* work.

My parents also own this game.

Honestly not too sure where all of hour hype is coming from.  It's a fine game, but a bit of a mindless point race.  It's nice for being just that, but nothing hat I would get excited about.

Jaipur feels like a very similar game, perhaps a little more luck based, but also has more depth of strategy having to weigh your odds and manipulate your opponent.  Splendor is simply making efficient choices and hoping it pans out better than your opponents'.

After several more plays, I'm warming up to it a bit more, there is a bit more strategy than I originally thought, but still nothing too exciting.  The excitement really just comes from hoping the other person doesn't buy what you're after first, or the right card is flipped at the right time.

enjoyable light "filler"-kind game, part engine building and part scoring-race; to me it is very similar to the recent Builders:Middle-Age that offers the same feel, same difficulty level/decision ratio, same playing time in a MUCH smaller box and more attractive theme (that feels less pasted on).

[+] very nice components and box insert, fast paced & short game with a good amount of decisions to make, easy to teach, not easy to master (you have to get the timing right of when to stop building an engine and start scoring)
[-] theme or no theme, that is the question... abrupt end game (Builders:Midddle-Age has that as well), seems weird that the "cost" of similar cards can be very different (a level 1 card with no point value costs between 3 and 5-6 gems, why?)

Simple, but still meaty.  Impressive in how reductive it is to bare bones Euro mechanics.  There's not a lot to chew on here mechanically, but there is an interesting decision to be made on most turns.  There's tactics, but there's also strategy.  It makes for a good filler, though it gets brutal if one player decides to take it too seriously and has a bad bout of analysis paralysis.

Thinking of picking it up for my collection... Not sure at the moment though.

(May 2014 after 1 4p game) - Had heard quite a bit of good things about this title - plays fast, nice poker chips/gems, set collection, interesting race to 15 points, etc.

It lived up to that.   I enjoy mathy games and this has a little bit of math in it and I see the comparisons to some Knizia titles - that is a good thing for me.   I see this as Knizia's Gem Dealer improved.

My favorite game at the moment. I really enjoy building up an array of cards and adapting to the requirements of the noble tiles and the third-tier cards. While there can be times when you take a much-needed card from an opponent (or vice versa), I think that in a two-player game, there are still enough viable cards available for both players to succeed. (Many of the games I have played have been decided by a point or two.)

For an economic engine buildergame, this is about as quick and straightforward as it can get without losing the depth of strategy.  This is a very impressive game.  I prefer to have multiple mechanics in a game (which is why I prefer 7 wonders duel) but some may find this more to their liking.

I really enjoy this game. Quick to learn, quick to play (3o minutes at the most) and very fast paced. I always felt Dominion is at its best when people are going really fast. This game is that way too. People who start with a strategy in mind and are determined to follow it don't do well. You have to be flexible and take what the game gives you. Great middle-weight game! We'll be playing this a lot with friends becuase of how easy it is to teach.

Clean, tight, and enjoyable game.  The artwork is fantastic and the component quality is great.

One note about the poker chips - my copy has thick, heavy (ceramic?) poker chips.  A friend got a different copy of the game with cheaper (light) plastic poker chips and it didn't feel nearly as good.

This game may not have the depth that some people want, but it has good player interaction and rewards strategic thinking.  Just enough randomness to keep things interesting.

Perhaps my most-played game, simply out of attempts to see its appeal. I suspect the larger problem lies with those with whom I play it, who are non-confrontational by nature. With that predisposition it becomes a silent exercise with little to evoke reactions or liveliness. It likely shines with those who get the knives out over a game of vanilla Carcassonne; finding a group like that, I will no doubt reevaluate.

I bought this game for 15 € from a Christmas sale in 2016.

This proved out to be a great deal! I've played this game with two, three and four players and love it! I even have the tablet app so that I can play solo.

Every once in a while I grow bored to it but then I find it again. I even like the theme even though it's so superficial. At least the superficial theme allows great art.

But the aspect I absolutely /love/ is the simplicity and eloquence of the gameplay. I used to love maths and this game reminds me of that. : )

RATING: 5
The game has a neat idea, but I think it suffers a little bit due to a few mechanisms.  The buying phase of the game is interesting, with the ramp up from being poor to being rich happening swiftly, so it feels like there's a lot of spending, and then the game is over.  It doesn't allow much time for altering plans, but then again, it's so short that it might not be an issue.  I also had problems with the game not penalizing players for reserving cards, since it seemed like it was too easy for players to mess others up just by taking cards.  It's an OK game, and I'd play it if others wanted to, but it doesn't strike me as something special.

Pure engine building. Every bit as satisfying as Dominion, but with zero card text and barely any rules overhead. As an added bonus, it plays great with 2,3 or 4. Best of all, each of those configurations feels like a totally different game. The four player game is resource rich and more relaxed, while the two player game is a slow grind with tons of hate drafting. While that will force the game into a specific niche for most people, depending on their likes and dislikes, for me it feels like getting three games in one box. For sure, I'd slot this just behind Biblios as the best filler game in my entire collection.

Don't judge this one by the box. I thought it looked ridiculous but picked it up on a recommendation. Played it twice the first night and dreamed of gems the whole night through.

Hmmm. Splendor is definitely a Thing (what does this even mean? Eeeh, can't be bothered explaining) (that's a lie) - I mean that it's a thing in the sense that yes, it has its own dynamic that may be worth something to someone. No, to a lot of people - and that's fine. For me, it just crosses the dry line (which is preeeetty distant) and is too simple. I prefer pretty much every other light VP conversion race over this. It's a flavourless and mundane exercise and doesn't invite any further pursuit. This will be OK for most people, but I always want my players, if not at all times, at some point, to be led to something more.

Splendor is mechanically a type of game I normally enjoy, but the atmosphere it creates is not to my liking. I dont mind Euro games where there isn't a lot of player interaction and everyone is just doing there own thing, but this game cultivates silence between the players. The only other words i hear anyone say during a game is "ooh" and "crap i was going to take that". Interesting system, but not enough bragging or trash talking.

Splendor is a nice and good game, but at least for me, it has its issues. For one the late game feels way too rushed and automatic (every player just seems to grab whatever he can afford for free and what gives the most points - the amount of decisions is very limited towards the end) and - at least with 2 players - one player can - by luck of the card draw - completly shut the other player out of one of the colors - which makes it nearly impossible for the other player to win. This can be very frustrating as it has nothing to do with skill but just with knwoing about this denial strategy and having the luck of the right cards showing up at the right times.

It plays super fast (10-15min), setup and teardown are minimal and the quality of the components is perfect, but for a really "great" game a bit more emphasizeon skill vs. luck would have been required.

Players take the role of wealthy Renaissance merchants buying and selling gems to turn into beautiful refined jewels. Splendor is an abstract game of "card drafting" and "engine building".
On your turn you can only perform one of four different actions, each action is a dilemma. Do you buy the mine that you need now, or do you buy the shop that you know your oponent needs, just so he can't get it.
Easy to learn, hard to master.

What I Like-
Grabbing chips, to buy cards, that make future purchases cheaper, to gather victory point cards and entice nobles to visit. Reserving a card for later. Good planning is rewarded. Low to no luck. Plays quick. 

What I Dislike-
Game ends at 15 points regardless of who went first. Cards have no abilities other than providing a gem and/or victory points. Turns are pretty flat in terms of actions and excitement. You either gather chips or purchase a card. No combos or special abilities on the cards makes it rather boring.

pretty good and satisfying game. problems with the game include: many cards rendered pointless by the fact that you could save for one more turn and get a way more valuable card instead of saving for 2 more rounds to get 2 small value cards.

this confirms the low esteem i often have for SdJ.
It's not bad because it has a good rhytm and plays fast... and yet... and yet it's an exercise in resources conversion. I'd use it as a gateway game but then leave it in a corner. 
Components, as everyone say, are quite good.
The theme is completely inexistent and in this case it is felt too much.
It is also quite slow at the beginning and it takes quite a long time to start "running". I can't find a lot of interesting decisions to make.

[Edit]: after my second game (that i lost badly) i want to raise the vote of this a bit. Its fast pace and the different ways you can set up your own game make it a fun light game after all and i'll play it again gladly.

With new games, I don't normally play them four times (kinda sad) in the first month that I own them, but Splendor has that quality that makes you want to play it again and again. There's not too much to this game: you get chips to buy cards which make it easier to buy other cards which eventually have points and having certain configurations of cards allows you to get more points. It's an efficiency engine much like St. Petersburg. However, this one is a lot more interesting for some reason, nice poker chips maybe?. Another benefit to the game is that it plays in about 30 to 45 minutes with all of the player counts and that time will get much faster with repeat plays. I'm looking forward to playing this one a lot more.

I have only played this game so far with 2 people. it's fast with 2. Easy to collect points but you have to think ahead during the other players turn. But just when you think what card you want to go for the other player buys it. I can hardly wait to try more players, the strategy will really change. More players will buy the cards you want to you will have to go with the flow and try and get cards the other players want. Great game, you must buy it. Beautiful art work and the chips with gems on them are weighted like Las Vegas Chips. No cheap components. Great family night game.

Card development and gem collecting through a card draft. Pay combinations of gems to play cards for points that also build your engine to get bigger value cards. Use your cards and gems to get a noble. Limited gem chips makes it a competitive scramble. Got to keep aware of what other players are going for and interfere when possible. Good components.  Keep an eye on the noble costs.  Good escalation and the game ends before you are ready.  Runaway leaders do not always win with luck of the draw.  The casino like quality of the chips add to the enjoyment of game play.

Gem mining and craftmanship might not be the most obvious theme for a game, but Splendor's simple mechanics do really shine.  It's simple yet, accommodates more than one playstyle.  It's short, yet leaves you with a sense of having achieved (or even built) something.

A nice surprise. It is a good deckbuilder-game that is easy to teach to new people, has really nice components and it seems to be a nice ratio between luck and skill. Since its such a fast game this has the potential to become a really great filler!

Tolerable, but about all I actually like about it are the art and the high-quality gem chips (and those drive up the price, so the game could have just used cardboard and not lost much).  I like the idea of a game about gem trading, but the simple and screw-your-buddyish mechanics are not my style at all.

Splendor is a great same that is simple to learn and interesting to play.  It has both tactical and strategic elements to it all in a 30 minute or less game.  It plays well with 2, 3, or 4, though each is a bit different.  

The game has little theme so it can be a bit boring to some that are coming from heavier themed games, but still enjoyable to play.  

The game does have better and worse strategies, though there they don't always win if you the play the better one.  It does still have to do with the luck of the draw and what other people open up to you in terms of options.  That is a small drawback of the game.  The player to your right can influence what options you have available so table positioning can be an issue.  I do suggest randomizing table position as well as start player so that you don't have anyone trying to be next to someone or not next to someone based on their skill level.

Overall, a great, quick game with enough depth to be interesting, but short enough to play multiple times rapidly.

I absolutely love this game. Easy to teach, accessible to those new to gaming and still interesting for more experienced gamers. 

The theme is completely irrelevant, and it's rather like an abstract strategy card game. Not a game that is high in interaction, and can feel a bit like multi-player solitaire with players that don't actively work to thwart each other. Which makes this a really great game for me to play with my kids when I want a more focused and (somewhat) quiet experience. 

I think this is a really great family game to include even very young players. The game play is not at all complicated, so a 4 yr old could play this easily. My 6 yr old says this is one of her favourite games, and she definitely holds her own against the rest of us.

Early game is extremely easy to be chip starved with no available actions: pick up chips, hope other players don't take the chips you need, buy whatever is available regardless of the benefit.

Late game strategy seems nearly impossible to plan and is based almost exclusively on early buys: I get discount for white and red, so I guess I'm buying those cards...

The game lacks depth, there's really nothing here.

A decent Euro that no one will be playing in three years because games have become completely disposable.

It's the new 7 Wonders, essentially, except it takes fewer players, it's a better game, and it could be a mass market hit if purchased and distributed by a Big Name Company.

Four plays was enough.  Others clearly disagree.

My go-to game for introducing people to new board games. It's a quick play, easy to explain, cheap to pick up, and the strategy is fulfilling. My only complaint is that for some reason it seems like this game kills table talk while it's going on. Probably a combination of quick actions and constantly changing state, so there is less time to think strategy through.

It looks so simple, but there is so much more.

Picking the correct gems to get the cards you want before someone else gets them and gets the visitors before you have a chance to say "you jerk!" LOL
I am hoping that you have read to description before you read this, or that might not have made a lot of sense.

It seems so simple but it is so deep.
Quick game that I will try to get in on when it comes up.

Great fun to play. If I have to pick up a game without solo play, I think it might be this.

Update: OK I DID end up buying this. I KNOW that the family is going to love playing this over the holidays!

Great engine building game with gems. I love the clay poker chips; they are easily one of the coolest game components of all my games.

I have mixed feelings about this one. It's quick, light, super fast to teach, and the chips are really nice and have a good feel.

The cards are relatively decent quality, and the chips used for gems have a nice weight to them (Update: Gems in newer printings of the game are no longer the nice, heavy kind poker chips).  Gameplay is usually really quiet, which is too bad.  Everyone's thinking, planning ahead, but about the only talking that happens is when someone gets upset that you either bought or reserved the card they were hoping for.

Nice concept, but feels unbalanced. It's more fun with 3 people. Haven't tried 4. With 2 it's a bit too simple. You build up your machine that generates gems to buy more gem mines. But once you feel you're engine is really running and you start to pick 1 or 2 level 3 cards, all the royals have visited and the game ends. It's lacking just that one mechanic or layer of depth to make it really interesting. The royals should be a little harder to get i guess. Or need to be more specific vs the general cards. (i.e. 8 black, instead of 3 red/green/blue for instance. So you really have to pick a strategy). 

Great artwork though! (But in a too big box)

The first time that I played Splendor I felt that it was just an "OK" game. It was fairly light and quick to play but nothing overly impressive. Time passed by and I saw it shooting up the BGG ranks but didn't think much about it. It wasn't until I started playing more games during my lunch hour and realizing that I didn't have many games that were suitable to fit in that time slot that Splendor came back on my radar. Yes... it was "OK" but, if found at a decent price, I would pick it up.

Well... I'm happy that I did. Yes... it is a simple and quick playing game but it's a lot of fun, looks great and, who doesn't like weighty custom poker chips? The game feels like a tactical deck builder to me, where you're trying to improve your own economic engine while ensuring that your opponents can't maximize theirs. The games generally end up being fairly close and it always seems to be a race at the end. Very fun.

I can comfortably play 1 -2 games in under 60 minutes. Given that this has gone over well at lunch and that my wife enjoys it as well... this could see quite a bit of action.

Splendor is another awesome filler game that will appeal to pretty much everyone. I'm so glad that I have this game because my wife loves it and even though it is a light game I still feel pleased as I'm playing it because you're constantly making choices in the game. I find that I love games that offer you opportunities to make different choices. It may seem on the surface that there aren't many choices in this game but the choices you have can, at times, be nail biting.  That is a rare thing for a filler game. I do feel like the game is slightly deeper than what some let on.  Don't get me wrong, the game is light but it's just so satisfying. Also, this game has complete open information so you can always see what your opponents are doing and what cards they're probably going to be going for. I'm not always a fan of this, but I do enjoy it in lighter games.

Fantastic game play but let down by a serious lack of theme. Ignoring the lack of theme, there is a smooth and natural buildup in the game from the Age 1 to the Age 3 cards. The game mechanic is simple but has much depth. Player interaction may be indirect, but is pretty substantial.

The gamebox seems overly big and poker chips unnecessary. Simple gem tokens with a thinner box would have kept its price down and made it more accessible to board gamers.

And suddenly there was Splendor. We were walking around a convention, and noticed a couple of players that were very enthusiastic. A bit too enthusiastic if you would asked me, but it got us curious to this game we’ve never heard of. In one way, that wasn’t strange, because the official release date was March 26, 2014, three days after we walked at the convention. I did some research on the internet, and the game ended on our wishlist. Just three days after it’s official release, we went to a board game store in Essen. And there it was. Brand new, only one copy left, like it was just waiting for us. We grabbed the copy and when we arrived back home, we started playing it. Wow, this game is a little gem. The enthusiasm of the players at the convention was a bit over the top, but on the other hand, not all people express their feelings like we do. We can be very enthusiastic about a game, and nobody would notice it. So, this was such kind of a game. The rules a very easy to understand and explain. Picking up playing the game, will take less then 5 minutes. The end of the game is most of the time very close with two players. Often it only differs one turn in who is winning the game. If we would have to give a point of criticism to this game, then it will be the short playing time. This makes it not suitable as a game. It’s too long for a filler game. It’s too short to give you the feeling that you’ve played a game. And the theme? Well, it’s a Eurogame. It’s pasted on.

My mother in law loved this game. I'm not sure if that moves my rating for it up or down. Edit: Played some more over New Years. Confirms that this is a great game.

Very simple, clean mechanics but I enjoy the weighty decision-making each turn and the ever-changing board. Not one of my wife's favourites though so its hard to get to the table. Tried it a few times solo with the Five Nobles variant, but prefer to play it with more.

Well designed and balanced simple strategy game with great components (heavy plastic chips). My only concern is the replayability, because it might get a little boring after many games because the game don't have that much depth in strategy. Theme is also pretty much pasted.

Játszottam most párat a mobilos alkalmazással és egyre kevésbé értem a játék körüli imádatot és díjesőt. Nagyon unalmas, nagyon mechanikus, az izgalmat pedig mindössze az adja, h elviszik-e előlünk a teljesítésre váró lapot... Nem nekem való, maradjunk annyiban.

After 1 Play: I enjoy games that try to boil down a mechanic to its bare essence while still keeping an enjoyable experience.  I think this game has succeeded in doing that but I'll need more play to really know.  This rating will almost certainly change with more plays.  If it really works it will get bumped up somewhat, if it doesn't it will go way down.

This game has been sitting on my shelf for the longest time & I simply never got around to playing it. Finally joined in a group at River Market, got my butt kicked the first time & then won the second game handily. Rules & strategy are simple & easy to learn yet the strategy can get quite deep if you pay attention. Works excellent with 3 or more players (haven't tried less yet). Awesome game for casual players & teens/kids.

Good mechanics, but lacked the immersion to really suck me into the game. I'll bet that within two years a game will come out that uses this style of engine-builder but have it connected with a really strong thematic tie-in and it will be amazing. So while this was fun, it got old.

We received Splendor as a gift several months ago and it's become one of our main go-to games, particularly because it's a short game. The gameplay is simple and the rules are simple but there is still substantial strategy involved in adapting to the cards that end up in front of you. For something that seems so straightforward, the replay value is immense!

RATING: 10
The best game to come out that year for certain. Have played it probably a hundred times, with all kinds of people. Simple to learn, no complicated rules. The cards have rich painted artwork and the chips are heavy and both give a lush feeling of luxury that enhance the theme of the game, and give a sort of restful contemplative feeling to something that's actually quite competitive. Love the iPad version and play that frequently as well!

Minus 5 Points from griffindor. The box is a lie, and so is the price tag. 
If the game was properly packaged and priced I would buy it and rate it higher. your move whoever still owns the rights to this game.

It's cool, simple rules and plays fast.  Easy to get the non gamer types into... Chips are top notch, linen cards would've been nice, but the cards aren't handled much.  Theme is a bit weak but I don't really give a crap about themes.

The worst thing about this game is all the noise people make with their chips!

Many people compare Splendor with Sid Sackson's Bazaar.  I own both games and beside the fact that they share the same theme,  they don't have much in common.  Splendor shares more similarities with his big brother St Petersburg.  Their mechanics are similar,  but Splendor is shorter (10-15 minutes per player) and is easier to learn.  It has the potential to appeal to non-gamers like mom and dad... and is still challenging for gamers. The material is gorgeous and handling those heavy tokens is really a pleasure.  Splendor is slowing raising among my top gateway games and deserves a permanent place in my collection.

My significant other picked this up much faster than I did which is rare. The mechanics are really simple, yet it has proven to be a challenge for me to grasp the strategy. The theme is basically non-existent, but the mechanics alone provide such a rewarding game play experience that it doesn't really matter, and the component quality is ASTOUNDING.

I've heard people saying this is too dense for filler, but I disagree wholeheartedly. Splendor is the 'perfect' filler in that it is quick without sacrificing strategy. Highly recommended for a game day warm up or wind down.

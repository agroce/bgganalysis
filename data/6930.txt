Wonderful components. Very clear and well thought rules. The only problem is that It has too many markers for my taste, and too many references to tables.

Only played cavalry clashes with some light infantry thrown in for good measure. Rating will hopefully go up when the meatier Swedish brigades and Spanish tericos comes into play.

The battle system of this game is complex and maybe overly so. But I am sure that is one of it's appeals aswell. We did the battle at NÃ¶rdlinger which consists of mostly cavarly units.. this excluded alot of the rules which made it a good starting scenario but it also made battle a bit strange in some regards. 
When cavalry and cavalry come head to head in this game the fight tend to end up rather messy with just as many casualities caused during your own initiative as during your enemy's.

Well try again but as a start alot of the game was decided by the die

Same as for ULB.  Huge learning curve, extremely fiddly counter exercise, GBOH with muskets.  Way too much cost to benefit, even if it has admirable historicity.

(2007-10-31) Excellent treatment of the capabilities and limitations of the armies of the day in battle. It is a detailed treatment without having detailed rules. While not simple, once you have grasped the rules it is quick playing.

RATING: 8
With this game, I finally figured out the Musket & Pike Battle System (MPBS).  Others have said this is a simple system.  I disagree.  It's counter-intuitive in many ways, making the learning curve steep and the "forgetting curve" equally steep.  If you play the system a lot, it will stick, but let it sit for a while and you'll be referencing the rule books frequently.  There's a lot of counter-flipping and sorting to do, also.  For those who dislike highly interactive turn sequences, stay away from this one.  Both players are engaged, all the time.

All that said, it does model 17th century warfare.  It rewards use of reserves and careful planning, particularly knowing when to pull units out of combat for reform or rally.  The games are physically beautiful and the historical commentary in the game-specific rule book is first rate.

Great system and four really good battles as scenarios.  Nordlingen is difficult for the Swedes (very difficult if you are trying to replicate your old SPI-Quad game plan).   Give the Swedes in Nordlingen to the better player and you've got four solid battles in the box.

Sweet Jesus is this one pretty game system. I haven't been this enamored with a game in a while. It drew me in the same way T&E did(they've nothing to do with one another gamewise). I imagine I'll buy every game in the series at some point.

Love this system, it requires so much of the players for what are relatively simple rules.  Didn't study the terrain before launching your cavalry wing forward?  Watch them slip into chaotic disorder before coming anywhere near the enemy.  Would love to see some single battle, folio size releases on these.  Maybe through C3I?  Just a  thought.

This is an excellent game system which I have had a lot of fun playing.  The activation/orders method works very well in conjunction with the system's triplet of morale, formation and casualty.  The system nice captures a lot of the unique flavor of the period.

RATING: 9
Best mix of tactical detail, command and control and simplicity I have seen. The simple command chit system forces you to plan ahead.  The game rewards the proper use of reserves. Timing is also an important skill in this game. A line of fresh troops charging into the enemy's tired and worn out formations will often  bring victory to your side.

Same system as This Accursed Civil War so the comments I made there are just as applicable here.  For those wondering what's new, SFO adds a few new unit types and has some very unusual scenarios. (most of the engagements presented are atypical of the linear battles of the period).  Personally, I think TACW is easier to get into, but this is certainly a solid, well-made product.

I rate it a bit lower than the other games in the series as I think the scenarios here are slightly weaker (with the exception of Second Breitenfeld).  They try to incorporate more operational elements (approach marches and flanking actions), but I think these maneuvers are often tainted by player hindsight (Jankau and Wittstock seem to suffer most heavily from this - at Wittstock, the Imperials will often detail a force to oppose the Swedish flanking manuever long before it enter the board).

RATING: N/A
My interest in that period rises after my play of the strategic Thirty Years War game by the same GMT.  I want to get hold of a tactical taste of warfare of the 17th century. The interactions among different unit types at tactical level may pose a problem to play.  I wish this is a game that is both fun and realistic. OOP now and still not yet getting a copy.  I think my interest in this game dwindled.

A great series of tactical battles.  Tense and lots of fun to play, with a great period feel.  The rules are a little fiddly to read, but turn out to run very smoothly in play, and the complexity seems both necessary and worthwhile.

The battles in this set are big, with some unusual situations to deal with.  One thing I like about the series is the way it handles both large and small engagements elegantly.

These battles are larger than the scenarios in This Accursed Civil War or Under the Lily Banners, so this isn't the best place to start if you are just getting into the series.

GAME: The Undercity: An Iron Kingdoms Adventure Board Game
RANK: 3356
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Amazing game. Love that it's 100% co-op with rules that are easy for non-gamers to grasp. For a board game it comes with a massive amount of miniatures that are larger and more detailed than anything else on the market. We have played through the whole campaign twice now and I even painted up the miniatures. I can't wait for the Heroes expansion and am super jazzed about the kickstarter for the sister game Widowers Wood

RATING: 9
Great light RPG game with engaging character progression and choices.  The campaign system builds an actual engaging narrative.  The full co-op nature of the game is a huge plus.  I think this IS the family RPG game.  I like the DnD boardgames, but this adds more character development and campaign narrative.  Just a bit more flavorful.  I think they hit a home run.  Crushes Descent for me.  NOTE: definitely play the campaign game first and make sure you play the first two scenarios before forming a judgment.  The first scenario is a bit generic, but in the second scenario you get a sense of what this game can become.

I really like this game and have become enamored with the Iron Kingdoms universe. It has some unique scenarios, but overall there's not many surprises here; If you like dungeon crawls with lots of awesome miniatures, then you can't go wrong with this one. I balked at the boring board when watching reviews, but I've actually come to like it quite a bit after playing a few times. The tile placement actually makes each scenario feel like a new space, and the lack of detail on the board is irrelevant once you're head is in the game. I've decided to get invested in this game, adding everything available for it, including Widower's Wood and its expansion, because I feel like it's an excellent toolbox for devising your own adventures, and I find the game to be a lot of fun. I also love the theme; it's a fresh parallel to (but not departure from) from fantasy proper.

Very similar to fantasy flights "gears of war". Wrath of Ashardolon etc is a much better game. No reason to own this, it brings very little new to its genre of game.

Initial rating.

Ugly board. Only four characters and you [i]have[/i] to play with four characters. Movement feels limiting. 

Looking to try it to see if the good bits are enhanced. Glad I didn't buy it.

Update Feb 2017
Well, well. Finally completed my Undercity campaign and it was a victory for the Black River Irregulars. What a great game this is. I now start another campaign with the characters in the BRI expansion pack and will try the updated rules for Widower's Wood.
Played my first game of Undercity and it was awesome! I really enjoyed the process of creating the dungeon with the tiles and I actually do not understand the bashing on the tiles by the so-called "reviewers". Moreover, I loved the flow of the game, and in particular I enjoyed playing event cards at the beginning of the round and witnessing how they make one plan ahead how to approach a round. As stated by someone else, feat cards are awesome as they provide character to the heroes, as each hero has a different set of feat cards. I really (and mean really) enjoyed the AI mechanism, as there is a myriad of combinations (number and type of villians to be activated, different possible activations and which opponent to target). However, what I enjoyed the most was playing with Pog and Doorstep. What a refreshing and cool mechanic that actually adds to the narrative of the game. I long to play Undercity again -- the weekend can not come soon enough!
Revisited Undercity and I can confidently say that this is my new co-op fantasy dungeon crawler. 
Chapter 4 was great fun and a close call for Milo AND Garek.

Very enjoyable dungeon romp.  It is a nice step up in complexity and tactics from the [family=9547]D&D Adventure System[/family] games without being overly complicated.  The campaign story is interesting and the scenarios are varied enough that you do not feel like you are doing the same thing over and over again (à la [thing=124708][/thing]).  I like how different each character feels when you play them - even more so once you customize them through the experience point system.

Great system.  I hope Privateer Press publishes some extra scenarios on their web site or another campaign to play through!

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable romp through the city of Corvis in the Iron Kingdoms setting.

But this is NOT a dungeon crawl. More a hybrid RPG-board game adventure with a heavy emphasis on combat. If you're looking for a pure dungeon crawl, this isn't it.

And PP needs to put out an FAQ ASAP.

Meh, average. 
The combat system is direct from a miniatures war game. Which means check, stat, roll. Succèss! Check new stat because you had a success. Roll, add drm etc.... Tons of extra bloated stats and info that does not matter in a dungeon crawl....wait this is not a dungeon crawl. Game board is set up before hand. Nothing to explore. Just a miniature war game pre Set board, to achieve goals with AI programmed into cards,  and roll dice....
Out of all the awesome dungeon crawlers out there.....this one does not make the cut! Out of my collection!

The map sucks, story is good. Figures are good, game play is boring and dated....

Ok, clearly this is not the game for me. Is it the game for you? Here's how you can tell! 

Imagine drawing a card that says "Attacked by rats! Make a hazard roll."

Now you grab the rulebook, which is handy because you haven't gone sixty seconds without touching it, and you look up 'hazard roll'... 

It turns out a hazard roll is when you roll a d6 - the only type of die used in the game -
and if it comes up a 5 or a 6, you take 1 damage.

Was there room for this info on the card? 

"1 die: 5-6=1dmg"

Yes! But was there room [i]thematically?[/i] 

No! It might distract from the awesome picture of a rat.

I'm keeping an eye out on this. I love the Iron Kingdoms IP, and a co-op dungeon crawl in this setting sounds awesome.
Let's hope they can nail the rules part, and this ends up being a good game with lots of expansion material.

What I have seen so far has given the game, and the others in the family a pass. I think the game system is a bit clunky for a board game, but still manageable. I don't like the fact that you have no equipment upgrades, and everything is only skill based.
The bendy soft plastic used for the minis doesn't help, and the price is pretty high for what it is.

A solid pass.

I think that this is the "dungeon-crawl" game that I've been looking for.  It has good characters, a decent campaign, and the characters improve between sessions.  I suspect that the 7 sessions won't be enough, but they have obviously left room for expansions.  This rating is dependent on those expansions.  If there end up being none, then the rating will have to go down.

I like the Iron Kingdoms world, and the characters in this game are pretty cool. The combat, and the way the missions play out are really nice in this game. This is a great game that any dungeon crawl fan should look into. The only shortcoming is the board itself, which is a little too bad, but the models are awesome.

RATING: 8
This may not be the most visually impressive dungeon crawler but the game mechanics and flow of play are top notch.  The A.I. feels fair and acts in a reasonably intelligent manner and there is a decent variety of enemies.  

The early scenarios may be a bit easy, but since this is a campaign game, you're really in it for the narrative (and the precious, precious experience points).  The difficulty takes quite a spike around scenario 4 and you will need a well-trained party to survive what the City of Corvis throws at you.  I've played a full campaign and enjoyed every moment of it.

Dungeon crawling/campaign game.
Probably most fun to people that are already a fan of the skirmish game. That said, it's an easy introduction to the combat mechanics which means it might get more people into Hordes/Warmachines? I know I'm more interested in actually getting them minis painted now.

Undercity does a lot of things right.  The four characters (one of which is a duo) are vivid, and the story draws you in.  The combat is interesting. And it's fun.

Great gameplay and good AI in a fully cooperative adventure game. The Story is pretty good and the "tactical" portion of the game is challenging enough. I even managed to play the game with people that do not love DCs but play RPGs, and we finished the campaign and they loved it. Maybe not the best DC or adventure game, but definetively a pretty good game.

It looks like a RPG, and feels like a RPG, probably currently the best Dungeon Crawler mechanic out there. Not sure about the dice, as I prefer symbols to read out, but as the numbers are not that high, and not too many dice involved, its probably fine.

Co-op dungeon crawl board game that is a spin off from the steampunk and sorcery world of The Iron Kingdoms. My curiosity and interest are piqued by the strange and unusual character classes like Jack Marshal Mechanics, Trolkins and Gunmages...I'm sure I screwed those up but they sound cool. Great way to cross sell and raise awareness of their RPG game system as well as making its components and minis fully compatible. I'm not sure about the 2d6 opposing checks combat system? But, I dig the Diablo video game feel of squishy hordes and rapid action paced with mini bosses and scenario bosses that require a little more collaborated effort. I also like the encounter action cards and prioritized tactics. Great way to simply and effectively add the AI so that it is not just a simple zerg. We have plenty of modular, scenario based dungeon adventure games but the theme and squishy horde fast action aspects are tempting to give a try and maybe look at the RPG? The designers get the award for best convention shirts

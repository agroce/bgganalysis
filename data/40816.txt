Some interesting ideas in this game. Would probabably be a lot better with more variety through the never published expansions.

Combat and movement are rather fiddly and unnecessary complicated without the benefit of more depth.

As I was looking for an alternative to Battlelore, I found and bought Magestorm at Essen 2012: despite its good-looking components, the way it plays is way too fiddly and frustrating. It isn't the game I hoped it was at all.

Playtester. Magestorm has several innovative mechanics so may not be anyone's cup of tea, if you are looking for something more "traditional". Personally I like a lot the movement/control system and the magic system, and I look forward to play with the "real thing" when the game comes out.

Artwork is fantastic, rest of components are very nice.  Up in the air about having to put together your own unit (the plastic pieces) when only the unique units matter (only 1 right now).  Lots of time to setup for a mediocre game play.  Never felt like the game left me wanting more or had any exciting moments in it.  Hopefully some expansions can breath some life into it.

Played once so far.  The first scenario seemed pretty cool.  I like the intuitiveness of the rules system, and the mage board was interesting. One concern I noticed so far is that because the terrain mainly provides defensive bonuses, it doesn't encourage you to attack, you would rather the opponent attacks you. 1 play is not enough to come to a conclusion on whether this is a legitimate concern though. The many combat steps made combat feel a bit tedious, but this may smooth out as I learn the game more, and some of the steps can be skipped over quickly.

The board and tiles, both in art and functionality, are embarassingly similar to those of "Battlelore", but the game itself has little resemblance except for the fact that it is also a two-player battle. The movement rules, based on set objectives on the map, and the combat, using cards for troops, are interesting. The magic system is the best part, very well thought with the gradual and branched channeling of power points. And each mage has a unique set of spells with different channeling paths.

However, the game feels somehow less than the sum of its parts. The luck in die rolls and the hidden constitution of units often make combat unpredictable. Also, choosing troops for each unit during setup feels like too much work for not enough payout.

Lastly, the miniatures are a bit of a disappointment, as the different models, except for one, have no importance to the gameplay. And why the bases hold four figures when three is the maximum number of troops in a unit represented by a single base?

I don't know why I got this. It's really fiddly, and it seems less interesting than many alternatives. Though the spells system and the luckless combat do look intriguing, it's more of a theoretical interest that makes me think so than a desire to play.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2013)

Magestorm was one of my oldest unplayed games. When I bought it (March 2013) I was very keen to play it, but it was a big box and no one wanted to play it with me. Had I played it at that time I’m pretty sure I would have liked it a lot more, as it stands, I no longer enjoy most tactical miniature wargames and I have become much harsher with my ratings.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex, but there are many of them. You can explain the game under 23 minutes. Playtime varies a lot because it is an scenario based game.

The game´s components are ok, the miniatures are very small, but fine. The art is great.

I really like how the mages work. If you want to cast a spell you need to have it ready by getting the mana where you needed it and, as this takes turns, you have to plan it beforehand. It is a novel and cool idea. The mages themselves are very different, I played with the fire one and I would have wanted to play with the fate one, but we played the first scenario and the mages are decided by the scenarios, a minor dislike for me, I would have preferred to choose any mage I wanted in each fight.

The units on the board represent whole armies and you have your units hidden until you fight. Each unit can have at most 6 troops and assembling said units seems fun in paper, but I was bored by it (long setup). You can have up to 12 units so it takes a lot of upkeep and table space. In paper this sound great, but in practice it wasn’t practical.  After the fight, the units become hidden again so you have to exercise your memory a little bit.  

The movement of the units is novel as well. You do it by placing markers in the objective you are pursuing, then the units move toward the closer marker, in a way you program the units´ movement. I like this mechanism. 

The battles are ten phases long and once you are familiar with them you can play them quickly, still it was a bit boring for me. The luck factor with the die is high, a minus for me in a long game.

There is very little variation in the base game, I know expansions were planned but it seems the game wasn’t a success, so the expansions were never released.

I also got bored by the needed assembly of each unit. You have to physically put the miniatures in a base and then, at the end of the game, removing the base again.
 
Bottom line, Magestorm is a good game if you like tactical miniatures. I like the idea of the game, but it is not for me. It is an innovative game (how the armies move, how magic works) but I got bored playing it. I, vastly,  prefer to play Mage Wars instead. It’s a shame it wasn’t successful as I think It is a novel game and a good game in its category. I generally dislike wargames, they are too fiddly and this one is no exception..

I don't want to give a rating just yet...to protect myself against the "new awesomeness" factor :)

But early feelings are GOOD.  This is so strangely similar yet dissimilar to BattleLore...it's odd.

The combat feels VERY different, but the map, terrain concepts and overall feel resembles BL enough.

I am happy to have them both, however, as they doo work differently and give different experiences.

Truth be told, my BL days may be over anyway, what with Battles of Westeros filling the BL slot for me, now.

I think each of these games is deserved of a spot in large collections, however.

I cannot wait to see where they go with new troops, Mages, spells, terrains, scenario-types, etc.

I am sold!

RATING: 6
This modular fantasy wargame was clearly a labor of love for its creators. There's an elaborate, richly detailed backstory about warring races and a scenario booklet with enough narrative  ballast to generate a a couple of Robert Jordan novels. 

Unfortunately all of the variety in terrain and tactical diversity boils down to relatively small variations on the same number-crunching grind in combat. The best thing about gameplay is the incorporation of the "mages" and the magical energies that they bring to each battle, but even this starts to feel a bit grind-y after a few turns.

Playing this now.

Have mixed feelings about it so far.
I love the magic system and the movement system using waypoints.  However some parts of the game seem like last minute additions that just serve to complicate things.
  
House rules for playing this game:
1. Bidding for priority:
Each turn, players bid for who moves first. Bid is done by secretly allocating some of the 4 spell tokens each player is to get this turn.  Players reveal how many spell tokens (4 max)they've committed and add a die roll to get bid value.  High bidder gets to choose to move 1st or 2nd.

2.  Move, Move, then Battle.
Both players complete their movement phase prior to any battles taking place.  If player01 moves to attack a hex, player02 is pinned in that hex and cannot move away when its his turn to move (this is why bidding for priority rule was added).  Added this rule to simplify the round sequence - having player01 move then attack, then player02 move and attack made it so its hard to remember what round your in.

3. New Minimum Damage rules:
If attacker has less then 1/2 the number of troops the defender does then minimum damage is zero.
If attacker has 1/2+ the number of troops the defender does then minimum damage = 1 hit per defending troop.

4. Base Loading and less fog of War:
If unit is small, then there should be 3 minis on the base.
If unit is large, then there should be 4 minis on the base (no more using 2 bases to rep a large unit)
Minis on the base should correspond to the troop cards for that unit.  If more than 4 troops in the unit then partial fog of war aspect since not all troops can be shown on the base.


Really like the size of the miniature.  Wish Gettysburg (Wallace) had used something like these instead of wooden meeples.

Very nice wargame with a fantasy theme. I'm a big fan of the card system that lets you determines unit strength, spell effects and terrain effects in a single glance.

However, this is not an easy game to get into. You might get lost the first (couple of) play(s). After that, the game flows more smoothly and becomes more fun.

Tactical fantasy combat system that has a strong emphasis on magic which is managed in a clever way. It takes a bit of time to understand the mechanics which are actually intuitive and come together rather well. The rules have a lot of examples which is great. Could have used a 1-page list of key rules not to forget.  

The minis are very nicely sculpted and easy to snap to their bases. They are a little flimsy though so you need to take care. I would have liked to see minis for every type of troop rather than generic to cover some types. The artwork is very good and evocative. The card based system for unit structure and combat works well.

Not too many units in the scenarios which makes the battles very manageable. Clever use of Strategy point system to deliver orders. There really isn't a lot of maneuver. Pretty much a slugfest, at least in the first 2 scenarios. I would have liked to see more than 10 scenarios.

All in all, this is a very good game.

Everything in this game says that the designer really (and I mean literally really) tried. It just wasn't enough. I found the most unique feature of the game, namely the movement rules novel, but ultimately not very interesting. "Not very interesting" sums up pretty well my sentiments towards the game in general. 

Componentwise Magestorm feels like the slightly poorer cousin of Battlelore, down to the board and terrain hexes looking almost exactly the same. The figures.. well they are crap.

Nice idea, good quality of component and... it doesn't work. The game, despite of interesting universum, is boring. All type of units seems to be the same, scenerios have broken victory conditions, battles are broken too (roll a die, counting counting counting...., roll a die, counting counting counting...) only casting spells is giving some fun for players.If your want to play some turn strategy on hexes i strongly recommend Tide of Iron instead of Magestorm.

Enter a world of high magic and bloody melees with Magestorm! Magestorm is a new fantasy board game series where you will finally be able to play fantasy battles as you dream them to be. Powerful magicians wielding god-like powers will call storms of fire from the sky, move hills, raze woods, invoke fear into the hearts of hundreds of enemies. At the same time, mighty armies will clash on the field of battle, and victory can only be achieved by the perfect combination of magic-using and military skill.

My true verdict is still out on this one and my rating may go up or down with more play.  I really believe it's a game about mage battles supported by army actions and not the other way around.  Plus it's pure fantasy unlike BattleLore which pretends to simulate historic medieval battles as well.  I also like the fog of war element where you don't know what your opponent's army consists of until you join battle.

Interesting mechanics.  When I initially read about the objective markers, I thought they would be really annoying, but they actually add a tactical twist to the game.  The fog of war is a bit weird too with the unit markers having no correlation to the actual forces.  The tracking of spells and the composition of the front line are also unusual, but work.  I would have preferred if the forces had more unique abilities.  The mages would be more interesting if they did not have different spells which basically do the same thing.  All that being said, it is a fun game.

Great Hexfield tactic game. My Replacement for Battlelore and Battles of Westeros. Magic System is fun, Battlesystem intuitive. The Balance of the scenarios is a bit off, but that is only my feeling after 5 games.

Not a bad little game.  One of those were the rules are much harder than the game itself!  If you've played Gulo Gulo (which is a fab kids' game) then you'll recognise the movement here.

So what do you do to win?  Get to the end quickly, concentrate on commodity majorities, grab ship cards, try to trade in trading post tiles?  Quite a lot you can do though some of it you will have no choice in - esp if 5 play.

I love the Pirates rule, which is a little piece of originality and fun for screwage possibilities.

By no means a classic Euro, but it's fun enough and has nice bits (as do nearly all Queen Games).

A dry, but pleasant Euro.  Nice mix of balancing short, medium, and long term goals.  Good player interaction.  Even though this is usually my thing, for some reason, it didn't knock my socks off.  I probably won't pick it up (the box is [b]Thebes[/b]-big), I wouldn't mind playing it again.

Batavia is an improvement on its predecessor, Moderne Zeiten, not least in the way it ends.  Moderne Zeiten finishes immediately when one player reaches the end of the track.  Batavia gives the finisher less advantage, with the round being completed and all players playing their remaining cards.  The randomized tiles on a track, rather than a fixed sequence printed on the board adds some variability.  Scoring is somewhat simplified; Moderne Zeiten's matrix is reduced to simple majorities in commodities.

At heart, Moderne Zeiten/Batavia is a game of auctions of packets of shares.  Gain a majority of shares in a company and your piece can advance to that company's next space on a track.  In Batavia each space grants a share in one of seven commdities. There is nothing particularly new in this game's auctions, set collection and movement along a track in the style of Knizia's Tutankhamen.  What did strike me as novel when Moderne Zeiten was published in 2002 was its mechanism of repeated stockmarket crashes (in Batavia it's pirate raids) that wipe out shares in the most popular companies.  This generates some interesting decisions about timing and auction bids because winning an auction is about becoming first player, not just picking up a selection of cards. 

I am fonder of Moderne Zeiten's twenties stockmarket theming and Art Deco styling.  Having said that, Batavia's re-theming to the 18th century East Indies is a reasonable thematic fit and Queen's artwork is up to their usual high standard. Production quality is good, except for the horrible paper money.

[ESP] La idea del juego es buena, pero lamentablemente depende mucho de las cartas las cuales son difíciles de conseguir, por lo que si alguien tiene una posición aventajada es difícil sacarlo de ella. El mecanismo del cañón en teoría soluciona esto, pero no siempre funciona.

A rather forgettable set collection and auction game that doesn't do anything new or interesting. Having said that it plays well as the various mechanisms all work well together.

Living in the Netherlands and as a supporter for the Batavia ship restoration project, I had to buy this game, when it was offered in a so-called group deal at SpieleOffensive.de.

Well.. the idea is ok. Stock holding and manipulation of how long you can hold on to each company. The game rewards the typical strategies, the board is beautiful, BUT: not so much fun or strategic gameplay. I don't know what was wrong. Perhaps it needed maturity on the main path-advance mechanic. Overall, a medium value game that could however be loved by newcomers to the hobby.

Weird stock-building and stock-crashing game.  I thought I liked the original version (Modern Zeiten), but I'm not sure now that I have played this re-make.  The games are pretty much identical... and the mechanics are very interesting, but much of the gameplay feels forced or out of your control.

Interesting little game where you bid on cards, try to get majorities in countries, and thinking about when to end the game for your best score.  While selling during the game gets you some good points, you can't ignore the bonus points for goods as they are a rather big swing in the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not horrible, not fabulous.  Mixes stock market mechanism from Moderne Zeiten with tile acquisition mechanism from... um... somewhere else, and ends with a whimper (and not the good kind).  Wouldn't try to talk my group out of playing, but would DEFINITELY see what's getting played on the other tables!

UPDATE:  After second play, don't see a need to spend any more of my life on this game.  There's a big luck of the draw both in the initial card draw and in the ship refresh, and the game is not long enough for that to even out.  At the same time, the game's already too long for what it is, so I wouldn't want to make it longer to give luck a chance to balance.

If I were to ever play it again, I'd like to try passing auction money out COUNTERclockwise.  As it stands now, the people to the winner's left get both preferential treatment during money distribution and an earlier position in the turn order.

Un eurogame de tiempo limitado (60 minutos), en el que tu comerciante recorre unas losetas alrededor de una "ruta de las especias" intentando ser el que consigue las mejores especias. Tiene un sistema de pujas para conseguir unas cartas que te permiten conseguir las especias, y una gestión de esas cartas para mantener tus posibilidades de conseguir dichas especias.

Tiene algún detalle meritorio, pero en general no me entusiasmo como para tener muchas muchas ganas de volver a jugarlo.

6/8/08 - pretty sure got the rules wrong for this one as well. Not sure where I got the idea that if you can get a majority in a countries shipping that you MUST do it. Anyhoo, need to play this again. It still was a pretty good game with this error. It is a beautifully produced game. Game play is quick.

Played and enjoyed a lot - very nice production on this update of the original Moderne Zeiten, with nice theming and excellent components and design - though I do miss the wee airships.  The game itslef is as good as I remember - likely worth a notch or two more with further plays as we didn't cotton on to the tile exchange rules till too late and that would help the game play out differently and, probably, better.

RATING: 7
A bit of a "blender" game I felt like - a lot of mechanisms poured together and stirred with little respect for theme - but still an interesting one I thought. Mostly tactical, but with some variety with the auction, and the tension between acquiring breadth and depth of commodities was nicely done. A game that's hard to coherently explain or understand from the rules, but clear once you've played a round or two. I liked it, but honestly there is unlikely to be enough here to get that many plays. Beautiful production, as is the norm from Queen of late.

RATING: 6
Neat little bidding game with beautiful art and components.  I'm not sure how to describe this one, but it's certainly different from anything else I've played.  A little bidding and a little majority control, where the majorities are used to travel along a path in a Cartagena-like way to obtain stuff that allows you to compete in yet another area control part of the game.  Lots of systems meshed together to create a clever game, but ultimately still didn't leave me feeling all that excited.

it feels like a mash up of a lot of other mechanics. Very tricky and the rug can inadvertantly be pulled from under you stopping you in your tracks. Claim tiles and products in the various commodities and make sure you focus on at least a majority or two. 1 Play.

First player rolls dice and starts auction for that many company cards. Winner becomes first player. 
Either draw two cards or play at least one card and move your merchant to the next good of a company you currently control.
When cannon reaches marked space, pirates cause players to discard all cards belonging to the biggest company / companies.
Final scoring for majorities in goods, most money, controlled companies, etc. Standard euro stuff really.

Batavia is a real surprise for me. Wonderful board with nice cards about sailing ships! There is everything given for a really pleasant afternoon. Since I'm very into sailing and have built model ships since my childhood, Batavia is just a perfect choice for me. The only missing thing from the rulebook is the 2-player variant, but it's tolerable. :)

Auctions in games are a bit hit and miss for me. I generally dislike them but when there is a closed economy, like here, I'm fine with it. I find it helps with the balance of the game. The rest of the game is fairly straightforward but I like the way you try to collect majorities and have to plan your moves carefully to make sure you don't get left behind while trying to make the most of what's in front of you. Plays well with five, which is handy.

RATING: 5
The first game I played wasn't a success, and the owner of said game was so disappointed with it that he immediately sold it off. I forgot about it until a relative brought it along, having purchased it a while ago and expressing an understandable desire to play. So we read carefully through the rules again, and began playing. The odd thing was that the oddness which had caused me to dislike the first game so much did not appear. In hindsight I could point out various rules errors which, owing to the criminally unclear formulation of the rules, had ruined that experience. So, here's the correct way of playing:
— When playing cards you must have a majority at the end of whatever you play. It can be an existing majority which isn't strengthened, it can be a new one, it can be several, doesn't matter. If for whatever reason you don't want to play a card, you draw two from the deck instead.
— When you cash in tiles for VP, the uniqueness of the tile you just picked up is the trigger which allows you to do this. And then you simply trade in a set of different tiles, even if you have multiples of a company.

So with the correct rules the game is decidedly better. It's not a great game (using either variant) because the luck of the draw has a major influence on the game plays out. It isn't luck in the sense that it doesn't allow the players control over what they do, but the distribution of companies does strongly affect how you pick up your tiles, and thus how you obtain your points. There is some nice leighweight potential for forcing the game to an end, and between seasoned players blocking each other so that majorities are lost gives the game a nice touch of bite. All in all the game is, as I said, noticably better than I remember, and if it weren't for the somewhat capricious nature of the cards and the somewhat shallow feel (despite the blocking there really isn't much in what a player actually does besides cashing in tiles and/or forming majorities) the rate would be higher still. But certainly not bad.

Players are merchants touring the Far East, building monopolies in shipping companies, and cornering the market in exotic goods.  Players on their turn either draw a couple of ship cards, or meld out ship cards onto the table.  Cards can only be melded if they own, or can take, a majority in a shipping company.  They then advance their pawn to the next market offered by a company they hold a monopoly in, allowing them to take control of that type of good offered there.  Game ends when a pawn reaches the end of the track (China?), and points are paid out for all sorts of things - goods controlled, shipping companies controlled, cash, ending the game bonus, etc.  I liked this game - some neat ideas wrapped up in a one hour package, and the Queen production is glorious (even if the tiles are a bit too colourful, making the important detail difficult to see).  Reminded me of many games, but had its own character.  Recommended.

Reimplementation of [gameid=4106] with a different theme: the spice trade in East India.  Players are merchants who visit trading posts of the five East India companies over Asia.  In terms of mechanics, it doesn't compare to anything I've ever played before.  Has an interesting auction mechanic to determine starting player each round, but the bulk of the play is playing ship cards to create majorities in order to collect goods via trading post tiles, and then exchanging these tiles for money (= victory points).
The theme doesn't totally fit with the mechanics, but it plays fairly easily and quickly.

It looks lovely, but it's a little over-complex set collection game. The main mechanism is driven by cards mainly collected by a crude auction (closed money-go-round, bid higher or pass out). Without the right cards, you can do nothing. With the right cards, you can nicely time your drive to the win. Played with all 5, maybe a better game with 4 or 3 players. Will give it another go, but not mad keen on it. *** Played again, pushed my rating up to 7. I liked it more, once I had the hang of what was really going on, it played faster and easier than I recalled. I would play this again, no doubt.

Batavia is a reincarnation of [gameid=4106]; the new theme and improved components make the experience different but I can't say for certain better.  I miss the little airships of the original, so I might just look for a copy anyway.

Interesting game, which I might play again. Still there are a bit too much area domination mechanics for my liking. But it's well implemented with the pirate attacks, whcih remove all previosly played cards for the company with most cards played. This gives a lot of tactical decisions, which makes it better than most games in this genre.

Same game as Moderne Zeiten (Jumbo, 2002). The rules have been improved immensely, but the game is still basicly the same. I liked the original version, and like this even better. However, I will only play the game with 4 or 5 players.

RATING: 6
Nice little game with majorities in two levels and a bit of set collecting. You need card majorities to move your merchant and do your stuff, and try to obtain majorities in various areas on the board to score, while occasionally trading sets of collected tiles for points. Unimaginative theme typical of many Euros, but improved by the art of Michael Menzel. The game is quick and enjoyable enough, but it has nothing to raise it above the crowd.

Unnervingly nasty, in a good way. This one took me by surprise. After the rules introduction I thought how simple it seemed and how obvious the choices would be, and then got absolutely destroyed. Like, stymied at every possible turn. I was left completely confounded, but wanting to play again, to try and figure this thing out, and regain a shred of dignity. It seems so innocent but hoo-boy--it's not.

It's pretty much a crap shoot as to what you can do with your hand and whether it will all work out for you.  If there was a way to draw cards from a pool when you sacrifice your turn to draw, that might help things.  But blindly drawing cards and getting a hand of random cards really hurts your chances of being able to play anything.

Also, the games I've played have only gone 6 rounds or so.  This means you are going to win an average of 1 auction per game.  The swing between a 1 card auction and a 6 card auction seem pretty large.

I'd like to enjoy the game more, and I don't hate it as I play.  But I do think that there's a couple of things that make it unejoyable for me.

Decidedly mediocre at best.  Drawing the cards is very random, but the game adds even more randomness because you have to roll a D6 to see how many cards come out in the first place.  None of the mechanics are interesting. I can't see myself ever wanting to play this game.

Okay. Guys. You CANNOT have an auction game with a closed currency in which the ONLY use for that currency is a single auction each turn! If you have nothing else to save your money for, then you will bid everything you can to get whatever comes up by random roll and do the best with what you get. I'm not sure I've ever seen an auction game that gets auctions so fundamentally wrong as this game does! There are nominal decisions to be made in the game play after the auction, but the best choice is usually apparent. *sigh*

I love the originality of the game: players have temporary majorities in cards they collect, which enables them to move forward and claim scoring majorities in commodities.  However, this is a game that can leave you stranded with no good choices, or floundering to just make any productive move rather than a real strategic one.

Works best with 5 for competition, but the last player can get a bad chance of landing on tiles he needs. But, 4 there is not enough competition for goods. 3 works alright too.

Did not seem to be as much changing of the company seals except when the cannon reached 25 and it forced a discard, which was interesting when 3 different companies were discarded simultaneously. I did not get the ships I needed to grab any of the trade post tokens though which put me in a dismal last place first time playing this. Something always draws me to this game, though I do not get much support from other people.

RATING: 5.7
More luck-dependent than it seems (or less luck-dependent than it feels after two plays?), this one has a nice mechanism but most of the time it felt like you are thinking hard but can't really choose from many different options - it felt there are optimal moves (or rather it felt most of your moves are limited by others' cards just too much). The final scores were really scattered (had a really big deviation, 10 points between each markers) and the last 3 players each thought they are going to lose before the final scores were known. Also the mechanism allows a rather strong kingmaking... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once, 3 players.  Pretty good, actually.  Rule book could've used another once over, though.  This is really just a set collection game with an auction.  Now, the auction is very tricky to properly value (not unusual in auction games), and it's not hard to throw the game.  This is probably better with more than 3.  Looking forward to playing again.

Although I liked the Modern Zeiten theme better, this revision worked fine.  It is essentially a turn-based timing game with an auction mechanism used to for majorities end scoring.  A group can easily get through this in under an hour if they have all played before.

A game with pirates = awesome.  I enjoy this somewhat simple set collecting/market control game with a touch of auctioning.  Even though the game is straightforward, a winning strategy has eluded me, but even losing all but a couple games, it still has a great gaming experience.  The only distraction is the pirate attack mechanism that can feel a bit fiddly, and I would suggest one person controlling it.

Great production and somewhat original ideas even though it boils down to set-collection (collect different companies and turn them in for points), area control (try to get the most of a commodity -- this is where the most points are scored) and auction (closed market where money spent is distributed to the other players).

The end-game seemed too chaotic as area control can flip quickly (most of ours were won by having only 2 of a commodity).  This may have been because there were 5 people (where my rating would be about a point less) which seemed to create some control issues.  However, the short play time makes up for some of those flaws.

Fairly straightforward set collection game, but it does have two interesting mechanics.  First, each tile that you take counts towards two different sets, countries and goods.  So, you are aiming for tiles that will help in both categories.  Second, you only get to select tiles for which you have a majority of cards in play (and these cards fluctuate throughout the game).  There wasn't a ton of depth here, but I think you could routinely fit this into 45-60 minutes, which makes it worth pulling out every now and then.

Már több hónapja megvan a játék, de nem tudtam vele játszani eddig, mert barátnőm eldöntötte a szabály alapján, hogy neki nem tetszik. Sikerült rávenni végre, úgyhogy 4-en kipróbáltuk. Barátnőmnek továbbra sem tetszik (makacs, majd megszereti..), viszont én nagyon élveztem a játékot, és a többiek is!
Kereskedelemhez igazából nem sok köze van, inkább többségi tulajdonlásról szól néhány remek ötlettel (kalóztámadás, lapkán előrehaladás) és gyönyörű kivitelezéssel megspékelve. Nem elég egy országban többséget szerezni, hiszen az egyes árukban is többség kell, folyamatosan változik tehát a helyzet!

Mi ha dato l'idea che si lascia giocare un po' da solo in base alle carte in mano. Il momento dell'asta è l'unico dove si ha veramente la percezione di poter fare delle scelte per il resto è un monotono susseguirsi di azioni. Manca un po' di mordente anche se la fase dei pirati è simpatica e interessante. Strategico ma quasi ingestibile il provare ad avere le maggioranze sulle varie merci.

RATING: 7
A really clever and pretty economic engine that grabbed us from the onset and never really let go. The closed-market auctions, along with a reasonably hefty bonus for most money are the crisp edge on what would be a fine game otherwise. A tight game length means that it's tempting to play twice in succession, which is surely a measure of success. My only complaint is that a custom d6 (say 2,3,3,4,4,5) would probably work better.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I had never heard of Batavia when I sat down to play, but I'm willing to try anything once [i](something I may want to rethink)[/i]. In Batavia you are collecting sets of goods to trade in for points and also competing over spaces on the board for area majority points. There is a bit more to it, but the rules are so convoluted that it'd take paragraphs to explain. And herein lies the biggest problem with the game; Batavia is a light, family weight Euro that is bogged down by an extremely obtuse rule set. Going into the game none of us could make heads or tails of what we should be doing. However; after one play I'd have a much better idea of what to do, but the game was so forgettable that I don't have any desire to play again.[/i]

RATING: 7
An interesting game, but with some inherent fiddliness which lowers it a notch. Plus the more you play, the more you realise how random the result is likely to be among people playing it reasonably. Because scores are lumpy and finely triggered, the game can swing for example on whether a Danish card or two comes out just before that Danish coffee tile appears on the track - and suddenly you're up or down 8 points accordingly. In the game, the only way to move forward is to play cards so that you have a majority in one of the 5 countries available, and then move forward and claim the next tile available in that country. The only way to win though is by claiming tiles in different countries, which allow you to firstly trade sets of different countries for VPs but more importantly, each country has one tile belonging to each trade symbol (coffee, etc), and you get major points for owning the most in each trade symbol. To do either of these, you need to win a country, then move on, win a different country, then move on, etc. This is helped somewhat by the fiddly part of the game, where when there's a set number of cards out across all the players, all the cards in the country which has the most cards disappear from the game, re-setting the card counter. There are counters on the board which need to move every time cards are played or lost, which means you're continually counting cards around the table, checking, re-checking, every turn. There's some nice planning to do with the majorities, some screwage possible using the card count limits, and a fair dose of luck based on what cards come out in the turn-starting auction (ie no american cards so my majority is safe vs I must win this auction because lots of american cards came out, but I haven't much money as I won the last auction) as well as how the tiles emerge (ie does the coffee you want emerge on a country tile that you're in a position to claim). So ... it's decent, playable, there's stuff to do, luck to manage, but it's fiddly, a trifle slow and there's probably too much luck going into the end result.

First impression:
Batavia is a light-medium game. The rules are a little bit hard at first read but they are not that complex. The matérial is superb. The game it self is not that tense but there is a possibility, by influencing the pirates attack, to change the game developpement. You can also, with the pirates, influence the majorities and back stab your opponents. This mecanism is fun and diminish greatly the chance of a runaway leader. Not a great game, but a plaisant one. So it's a keeper.

Première impression:
Batavia est un jeu médium-léger. Les règles ne sont pas claires à la première lecture mais elles ne sont pas complexes. Le matériel est superbe. Le jeu n'est pas intense, mais il y a possibilité d'influencer l'allure de la partie en exploitant les attaques de pirates. Vous pouvez, avec l'attaque de pirates influencer les majorités et poignarder vos adversaires. Ce mécanisme est plaisant et évite la possibilité qu'un joueur s'échappe rapidement avec la victoire. Batavia n'est pas un grand jeu, mais il est plaisant. Donc à conserver.

To be fair, we played a 2 player variant, so I am not officially rating the game.  Beautiful bits but game play fell flat.. Random and not very deep decisions to be made. And it was SO fiddly moving the company cubes and the cannon after every single card is played.

Rating might go up if I get more chances to play. The (irrelevant) theme of East Indies trading appeals to me, as do the nice wooden bits, and the the auction, plus the opportunities to sting people by triggering a pirate attack. But I'm not yet convinced whether the whole is even equal to the sum of its parts.

There's a few good ideas here on your way to scoring victory points through multiple mechanics. That said, the game is constantly a fiddly one, counting cards and counting more cards and counting. Decision wise there's a few things you can do to play well. I'll certainly look into holding back more cards in my hand and going hard to pick up one of each nationality. It's key I think. It's an engaging little game that I wouldn't mind exploring a bit further with different player numbers. One of the better efforts from Queen Games and worth the tweak with the new theme.

The sweet spot here seems to be four players. Unfortunately if die rolls aren't high then card supply is low, which in turn limits player choice and increases the luck factor significantly. With first place in a commodity gaining all the VP a bit of luck in a high price commodity can see you pick up a third of your score. In games with high levels of planning and thought put into each turn a high level of luck lowers that rewarding feeling. That said, it's quite quick and fun to play.

Midweight majorities game pasted on Gulo Gulo with some auctions added in.  Better by far than Moderne Zeiten, but likewise far less exciting.  It works, and you could say that it is even clever, but there isn't much here to love.  Failed to find the fun factor.

The art is gorgeous though (although, I don't think the world needs another game cover depicting a white guy standing in front of a ship being loaded by brown people).

Quite a bit going on in this gem of a game.  It's essentially just a set collection game, but there are a couple nice twists: first, you auction off (in a closed economy) a new set of cards, the size of the set which is determined at random, and second, the most common cards are discarded periodically.  Finally, the sets can only be "cashed in" at opportune moments, and you're also trying to collect the majority of different commodities.  I think the auctions and varying intersection of set collections are what makes the game great.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game: set collection, pirates (arrr!), traumfabrik-type auctions, etc. From reading the rules I was expecting this to be more fun -- need to try it again (we did get some rules wrong).

The board is a chain of tiles with one company per tile, as well as one of 8(?) goods. Each round, auction off a set of cards (roll die to set number): pay everyone else as evenly as possible. Then on your turn either draw 2 ship cards, or play ships to your display (but only if you have or can the majority in 1+ company). If playing ships, advance meeple to next tile matching any company you control and take that tile; place a marker in the market for that type of good. Also, you may trade in a set of tiles, but only if the type you just collected was one you didn't have before -- get more VP for turning in a larger set (of different-type tiles). Pirates attack when sum of all ships >= 24 (or less with fewer players): attacks biggest shipping company (all ship cards discarded). The game ends when any meeple gets to the end of the chain of tiles. Final scoring: majority presence in each goods market earns VP (different for each good), companies controlled, cash, ending the game bonus.

This is a great game with several interlocking mechanisms and some great, thematic, rubberbanding mechanics to keep anyone from falling too far behind.

There's been numerous complaints about the theme, and how it doesn't really integrate properly with the game/actions.  And here it is a bit of an odd duck, because really, all the actions do fit the theme extremely well.  I believe these theme complaints arise from the fact that your role as player is nebulous--you are neither investor nor ship's captain nor trader...although the mechanics have your hand involved at all those levels.  So it's not that theme isn't there, it's rather, that the theme is isolated from the player.

It's a fun sort of... uh, I'm not sure what to call it, exactly. I guess set-majority game? With pirates? It's... strange. The mechanics are a little all over the place and seem totally unrelated to the theme, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. It's basically a lot of struggling to make sure you have the most cards in a certain type when you want them and then making sure that when the pirates attack your card-suit of choice is not that one that gets washed out. It's clever and interesting, and I'd definitely give it another go (with 5, especially--it seems like one of those games that would suffer with less players), but it's overall a bit bland and lacking in anything that really makes me go "wow."

It took a couple of games for this to click, but now that it has, it feels great. I guess the idea of playing cards in front of you is a bit like Union Pacific or Get The Goods, but the way the scoring works here is radically different. Lovely, bright, components. The only complaint I'd have is that the flags on cards can be a little hard to pick out across a table.

We played 5 players and I think this might be too many. All but 1 tile was taken and we only got to win approximately 1 auction each. That makes the auctions themselves pointless and basically random if you win an early one (and then have no chance to compete later on).

It looks pretty and I wanted to like it. I didn't. :(

Seems like an enjoyable little game. I'm not too sure on the tactics of rushing ahead to the final tile, to end the game quickly, versus hanging back to collect more valuable tiles. It seems the game could vary in length quite a lot, depending if any one player is making a concerted rush towards the ending. That tactic certainly worked for me, as it won me our first game, though that may have been more luck than judgement.

This is a game that a friend has had for a while, and wanted to try. I didn't know anything about it other than it looked Euro-y.

In the game there are 7 goods types and 5 countries. Each country has a "trading post" tile for each good, so there's 35 tiles. Each countries' tiles are shuffled first and then you lay out the path of trading posts, making sure that they are laid out in batches of 5 where every country has a tile in each batch. Only the batch you're in (or were in previously), and the next batch are visible. Players start with 15 money (promisory notes) and ten country cards.

In a round, the start player of the previous round starts an auction by rolling a die. That many country cards are turned face up from the draw pile. The winner of the auction gets those cards and the starting player marker, but pays his bid to the other players (as evenly as possible) and then takes his turn.

On your turn, you either draw two cards (rarely done) or play some number of cards, assuming you can end up with the majority of cards in some country. First you advance the markers for the country cards that you played and advance the cannon marker once for every card played. If the cannon ever hits a certain number pirates attack and the country that has the most cards out is reset to zero, all those country cards are discarded from everyone's tableau and the cannon goes back however many cards you discarded.

Then you take (or retain) the seal for having the majority in countries and move your merchant to the next trading post tile that matches one of the countries where you have the seal (i.e. the majority of cards for that country). That trading post tile becomes yours and you place a commodity warehouse for that good (there's a majority contest for every good at the end of the game). You can then redeem the trading post tile you took (assuming it is a different country than all the other tiles you own) and optionally redeem any other country tiles you want (as long as all the ones you redeem are different). This gives you points for each different country tile you redeem (triangular scoring).

Eventually some will reach the end of the trading post track, which gives them 4 points and triggers the end of the game. You play out the round. Finally, all your remaining cards in hand are played and country majorities are recalculated. At the end of the game, each seal is worth 2 points. Most money is worth 5 points. You evaluate each good and see who has the majority of commodity warehouses for that good and award the points for that good type to the player with the majority (full value for a clear majority, half to each if tied).

The game seemed interesting. There were some interesting choices, especially when the cannon was approaching a pirate attack and you might be able to flush other people's country cards. There was also some strategy about being able to maintain a majority in some country and being able to deny other players the ability to take that seal, which means they can't compete for the trading posts of that country or redeem trading posts as easily. That being said, I felt like it was hard to ever have enough control over what was going on in the game. You want to strategically compete for majorities in the commodity warehouses, but the tiles come out in random order. And the country cards come out in random order. So whether you can win the right majorities at the right time is a bit dependent on luck. If you're not getting the right country cards, which might just be because not many come out in auction, then your ability to compete is really hampered. At best it is very tactical. Also, it felt very familiar in a "There's some other game that does this better" kind of way... although I'm not sure I actually know a game that quite does this.

Some of my opinion may be based on the fact that I was feeling a bit under the weather and didn't quite grok the game well. My opinion could change on a subsequent play.

Batavia is a very interesting "closed economy" auction/set building/area majority game. Players bid for country cards, the winner pays everyone else at the table and takes the cards. You play cards down on the table in sets, if you have a majority of that country, you may move your man on the board forward to the next commodity tile depicting that country. That allows you to place one of your markers on that commodity. At the end of the game, the player with the most markers on each commodity gets the corresponding points for it.

I quite liked Batavia, we played it three times in the last few days, rare for us. There are lots of interesting decisions to make, do I put down these cards and jump to that spot, it gives me a guaranteed majority in a commodity, but anything you jump over you can't go backwards and get. Careful manipulation allows for some tricky back and forth as you fight over majorities.

We played with our own 2 player variant which we think works pretty well, so I'll be posting that soon.

While this game, like so many others these days, is hardly novel, there is enough of a game here that it will hang around.  Memorable?  No.  Decent game?  Yes.

After a second play, I've downgraded it a notch.  Maybe it is better with 4 than 5.  Maybe not.  In any event, it won't hang around long enough to find out.

An interesting game, if somewhat frustrating. Being last in the turn can really screw you, so you need to try to win auctions or at least help the player to your left to win them. But we've only played it with 5 -- those issues may be better with less.

Also if the die rolls are often low, it can be nearly impossible to take majorities off other players unless they get wiped out by the pirates (and if another company is higher that can be difficult to achieve). It might be better to use an average die, as suggested elsewhere on BGG.

Playing Batavia with 5 reminds me of Acquire with 6.  There is simply no way to plan ahead of time because the control of companies and the available trading post counters can vastly change by the time you get to go again.  The majority aspect of the different commodities seemed more like an afterthought rather than a fleshed out idea.  I did found the pirate mechanic to be somewhat novel, but ultimately the game is so reliant on getting the right cards that there is no real strategy involved.

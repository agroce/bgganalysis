GAME: Doom: The Boardgame
RANK: 794
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[Base game: 7; w/ expansion: 8]
Doom is like multi-player Blood Bowl with sci-fi weapons and huge aliens. You have to plan ahead your turn considering movement paths, relative positions, special abilities and the inevitable role of luck, maximizing your options and the probabilities of a good outcome. Then the alien player comes in and takes perverse pleasure in messing with your plans. The gameplay is fluid and the rules are simple yet effective, with almost zero downtime. Combat is handled with special dice that bring in play range, ammunition usage and precision in a single roll. Not every weapon seems to be balanced, but they can work pretty well just out of the box. 
If you ignore the fact that you need to buy the expansion to make it work properly (not unusual with FFG), or at least download the rulebook to use most of its rules modifications and more streamlined scenarios, for me this game is a solid 8. On the other hand, considering only the base set, it can easily become a slaughter fest for the alien player, with the odds strongly against the marines. 
I'm still a bit worried about longevity, and it doesn't lack some flaws, but I admit being pleasantly surprised by this game so far.

Great theme and very well implemented. Great components (miniatures scream to be painted), with the exception of the cards being of the usual "it could have been done better" quality. Some minor complaints about the junctions between the board sections, not always well cut, but that's all.

RATING: 7.2
Has the feeling of Doom; they did a good job at capturing the feel of the game.  May not be balanced, but that's alright because it's fun and the unbalance is thematic (the marines don't have to roleplay fear, they are [i]actually[/i] afraid of something jumping out and killing them at any moment). The minis are very nice, too.

Rules-wise, it's very easy to learn or teach others, with not too much stuff the marines have to remember or keep track of. The dice combat is a simple and cool way to show damage, ammo usage, and range, all in one roll. Monster spawning is a bit gamey-feeling, but at least it makes more sense in DOOM than in DESCENT.

Many complaints about the game can be fixed by making a scenario to your liking (with more ammo, less rooms, or whatever).

RATING: 4
I want to like this game. I enjoyed the playing, except for the fact that it took our group about 5 hours for the first game! We played the scenario that FF posted on their site. I guess it's supposed to be easier. I also gave the marines a lot of help (read more stuff to start with). They barely won. All in all, it's cool... but we could have played 5 games in the time it took to play one small scenario of Doom. I'm just not sure if I can spend my time in such a way. But man, it is fun and dripping with theme. We'll just have to see I guess.

UPDATE: traded (w/ Medici) for El Caballero & Quiddler.

Well, after playing Doom today I decided that it's not a bad game. Not great, but good. It only takes forever. A lot of the mechanics tend to slow the game down. That said I still enjoyed the choices it gave me. And it wasn't as random as before. It's really meant to play against someone who has a feeling for miniatures games and knows how to get everything out of their choices available to them. Otherwise the game gets really unbalanced to either side. The weird thing is that you still get people who request to play it. And funnily enough they enjoy the experience every time. I think I prefer this over Memoir '44

Very strong on theme. I love the atmosphere and the mechanics work well with the theme. Better gameplay than Space Crusade but the setup is even worse. The sculpting of the figures isn't that beautiful.

However, the game moves on a bit too slow for being such an action filled title.

Rating based on 1 play.

This had me very excited.  The plastic is unbelievable.  The theme and the mechanics are great.

As far as the game, it has balance issues -- enough to wonder if the designers properly playtested the game.  I played 2 Marines at once.  They kept running out of ammo.  There was very little to be found, and I had rocket launcher ammo, with the rocket launcher nowhere in sight (which definitely does not follow the video game).  Monsters kept appearing.  All the monster player has to do is line them up in a skinny hallway at the door, and there is no way the Marines can fight that war of attrition, with little ammunition that runs out too frequently (red die = 33% chance).

Relative to the game (where only 1-2 monsters are in a room), there needs to be a balancing mechanic that everytime new monsters appear, more ammo and health appear. And maybe the Marines should be getting 2 attacks to go along with movement, or they needed some cards of their own.  (and many of the monster cards were definitely not related to the game!), or maybe limitations on the frequency of monster spawing or the number in a room, but really, the bigger problem was lack of ammunition.  2 ammo pieces against a roomful of monsters = defeat.  It was just very, very unbalanced.

Some say it mirrors the video game.  Not.  Even at the hardest level, I could get farther at the beginning.  But to make the boardgame better mirror the videogame, there should be an Easy, Medium, Difficult level to mirror the experience level of the Marine player, who definitely is at the disadvantage as a beginner.

With that said, there is a very good game in here.  Fundamentally, the game had solid mechanics, and it followed the theme of the game, and before the board became filled with monsters and no hope of winning, it was fun.  If this one were tweaked, it would be an excellent game.

good system, great components, but as the game is now the marine players have no chance if the invader really plays to win. The experience is better when the invade plays like an evil RPG Gamemaster.

The simplest dungeon crawl that gives a good kick. The production is top notch, love the minis. 

Gameplay wise is dependent on what both side draws. The marines and their powers, and dungeon master's draw as well. 

Play progresses quickly for a 2 players. 

Good gateway game for newbies.

French version got in trade.

Having only played part of the game, it looks much like Space Hulk, with the possibility of having more than 2 players. While my first game was with 2 players, one thing bothered me, the re-materialization of the character "fragged", and the use of the "fragged" term. I understand that it's all part of the theme (video game), but it's the part that drives me out of the theme! (martian security officer repelling invaders).

Update 2008/05/06:
Having played Descent recently, I think I'll be giving this one another try very soon.

My group's gateway game. After playing Descent, I thought DOOM would be ruled out and never be played again, but it's the subtle differences between the two that make them different games. The presence of ammunition in DOOM creates a far more balanced game in my opinion and keeps it interesting for all players.

RATING: 7
DOOM the Board Game is the original Descent 1st Edition. Before Descent was even a thing, there was DOOM. A campaign-based dungeon crawler about running, shooting, sneaking, and finding big ass guns. It's definitely solid and kicks off the genre stupendously. I'm giving the graphic design a break for being so old here, but most of it still stacks up quite a bit. The minis are fantastically implemented and fragging them sure is a lot of fun.

Things its spawns (Descent/Imperial Assault) later did better:
-Better miss mechanics (Imperial Assault). In DOOM, there are multiple dice with the dreaded X auto-miss everyone hated from Descent 2e. Some with TWO X's. Holy hell, no. IA fixes this mechanic to be a lot more tolerable.

-More robust class systems. Descent and IA both implemented player uniqueness to a much larger and deeper degree. With tons of gear, weapons, and special class-based abilities. DOOM on the other hand has a few set weapons and a couple of specialty cards you can earn. With a bit of re-tooling to the system, DOOM could be a lot better for the modern era.

Things DOOM does better than its spawns:
-Ammo depletion. It's just so simple: you have ammo tokens. They are discarded if you roll one of the most powerful die faces. Done. Perfect. Balanced. Fun. Makes you search for health and ammo and armor like the video game.

-ACTUAL dungeon crawl. Descent and IA are not dungeon crawls. Descent is an asymmetrical racing game. IA is an asymmetrical skirmishing game with story elements. DOOM however is run by a deck of cards that simulate A.I. and the campaign book. It's basically the Descent companion app in physical form. Brilliant!

-Streamlined, satisfying combat. DOOM's combat system feels like you come up with a strategy and then bust some heads. Very fast and cuts out the nonsense that moddles up the later incarnations.

The biggest turnoff for DOOM in your collection would just be that it's completely campaign-driven. There's very little in the way of replayability especially once you've beaten everything (plus the one and only expansion). This feels great while playing, but the lack of player classes and additional ways to experience the same campaign can hurt its long term value. The dice also suck ass.

Otherwise, DOOM is the best Descent-like out there. One of the best dungeon crawls I've played, in fact.

Haven't played this too deeply, but did not enjoy it.  Needlessly complicated and heavily unbalanced against the team, while also presenting an excessive number of false choices that only serve to make it harder to win.  So much possibility for player selfdestruction that the solo needs to do little more than spawn monsters and cause ammo to be wasted for a quick, boring game.

I found this game a fun diversion and even the game ran about two hours, it never seemed to drag or grow tedious.  The components are nice and the modular board just begs for customized scenarios.  This is good one to pull out if you feel like a game that is lots on theme and some tension.  The constant running close to out of ammo makes for some tough decisions.  So far, I like!!! Added to collection 6/05
Update: dropped from a 8 to a 7.  I must admit that the setups a re a pain and can keep me from playing this sometimes.

A great dungeon-crawl.  Admittedly there isn't a lot of long-term strategic planning, and the scenarios can be unbalanced (the rules in the forthcoming expansion (avaliable from FFG's website) make some balance changes), but I really enjoy spending a couple of hours trying  to get out of the mars base (or trying to keep the marines from doing so).  Unfortunately, the game almost never takes only a couple of hours.

The game is sort of half tactical mini game/half RPG. The invaders book tells a good little survival story with the missions and they are quite varied. The models are huge and add to the fun whilst playing. 
If you have this you probably don't need the coveted Space Hulk as this achieves the same end and is probably more varied due to the card play and very clever dice mechanic.

It does play like a computer game. The 'baddie' player has to get so many 'frags' or marine-kills to win and the marines have to get to the end of the mission. So, essentially the marine players have a number of 'lives' to get to the end of the game with. If a marine gets killed he can be respawned onto the board near to where he 'died' so they don't lose too much ground that they've gained so far.

We've played a three player game (2 marine players and Invader)and it does feel hard for the marines but in no way would I say it's to the detriment of the game. In fact, as long as you see it as a challenge to even survive with marines and don't see it as you vs the baddie player in a competitive sense I think it should be a lot of fun.

The random nature of the marine skill card can generate some super powerful marine combos. We had one marine armed with a chainsaw and shotgun who just mowed down anything in sight - great stuff! I was the Invader and got to watch all my beasties demolished in very short order - doh! :D

Great atmospheric Ameritrasher, flawed by a pretty unbalanced out-of-the-box gameplay as well as long game length with frequent pauses for partial assembly of another part of the level. Still, production values are high and more often then not playing it is a blast.

Space Crusade for the post-PC generation. Nice game floored by some poor and incoherent rules. 

OK, the rules are floored, but they can be adapted if it really plays on your mind. On reflection, I've really grown to like this game and the way is so evokes the theme and the PC game around which it is based. It's tense, dirty, close-quarters fighting with all sorts of uglies and I love it. While the game certainly favours the invader, it creates some interesting tactical issues for the marines. A careful balance must be struck between trying to slay every creature in sight and the often more prudent approach of running away as fast as possible. Better a live coward than a dead hero!

Ugyanaz a szerző, szinte azonos a mechanizmus... kísértetiesen hasonlít a játék az Odalenthez, helyesebben az Odalent hasonlít a Doomhoz, de mivel én az Odalentet ismertem meg előbb, ezért nekem az a kiindulási pont. 
A kettőt összehasonlítva: az Odalent egy kicsit jobban bejött. A Doom-ról mondták azt előzetesen, hogy nehezebb megnyerni, mégis itt álltunk közelebb a győzelemhez:) Nem rossz játék, még játszani kéne vele, de az első alapján kicsit jobban megfogott az Odalent hangulata, nem tudom megfogalmazni miért. Lehet, hogy csak a pillanatnyi hangulatom döntött. Vagy a szabályokban lévő árnyalatnyi különbség ennyit számítana? Nem tudom. Azt tudom, hogy az Odalentben izgultam, hogy milyen szörnyre bukkanunk az ajtó mögött, itt valahogy kevésbé jött át a hangulata a játéknak.
Az Odalent 4 órája elröppent, itt viszont soknak éreztem a kb. ugyanennyi játékidőt, talán mert túl hamar nyilvánvalóvá lett még kezdőként is számomra, hogy nem nyerhetjük meg a partit.
A sci-fi közelebb áll hozzám, mint a fantasy, mégis az Odalentre szavaznék most, de még mindkét játékkal játszani szeretnék!

One play against 2 marines w/o expansion: tight game, nice choices for the invader, sure had a learning curve especially for the marines that are fighting wave after wave of baddies coming their way. Well, I like dungeons anyway, so maybe biased but I liked it. Truly anxious to use the expansion..

A funny game. I don't like that much being the "dungeon keeper" (Be the hero is much funnier), but in the overall is a realy nice thematic game.

A boardgame based on the most famous PC-Egoshooter? I just bought it because it was very cheap and the box heavy - promising a lot of parts. Like all Fant. Fl. Games it is something for the eye and to my surprise also fun. Needless to say that my Marine died early but only because we misinterpreted the rules and spawned the boss-monsters too early. The game is fun but in my opinion a CD with spooky backgroundsounds and noises or even a fitting audiobook are missing.

Balance is off depending on the number of players.  Exciting to the end, engaging, slightly tactical (not so strategic).  My second biggest complaint would be that there isn't so much depth to the game...but that's a minor complaint.  My biggest complaint is that it's way too long.  I would much rather play Descent.

One of the best games. Fast paced, very intense in connection with a true survival atmosphere. Hard to win for the marines but always a blast to play.

Not only that it is the best boardgame based on a PC-game-licence - it is even more a masterpiece of boardgame design. 

DOOM beats out Descent easily. 10 out of 10 - a modern classic!

I so want to like this game, but there's just so many flaws. For every saving grace, it has an egregious blemish. In fact, I would say this game is unplayable right out of the box.

I would highly recommend this game to any hack-n-slash gamers, with the caveat that they look online for a few much-needed modifications. Still, I can't justify giving it anything less than a 7.

Yes, this is the old school FFG Doom: TBG. Played through 1st scenario with 2 Marines. Marines won, but it was very close. You really have to plan your moves out as the Marines, use you Order tokens wisely and not stand around trying to kill everything in each room. Also, the initial Marine card draw can be a really big deal. One of my Marines had an extra Armor and 3 extra wounds from the get go. I will finish out the 5 scenarios in the box and then the Expansion scenarios as well, then probably trade this out.

Very good value for what you get in the box. The game is well produced. Rules are not difficult, and a newbie can play after 5 minutes explanation. The dice system to have range and hits rolled together is very good. If FF keeps adding scenarios on its website, this game will have a high replay value, given the very different skills marines can have. I enjoy it, even if dungeoncrawl is not my preferred genre. This game is fun.

This game always had me in two minds. I love the theme, and how the baddies and weapons from the video game are represented. I love how it's difficult for the marines to win, but that they can still feel like total badasses with the right card combos ("ground assault" FTW!). But the long setup time is a real pain, there are too many fiddly tokens to manage, and the game just starts to drag if it's obvious the marines are going to struggle to find the exit before losing their frags. Plus, as the invader player, holding onto a hand of eight situational cards makes it hard to keep track of what your options are, and many of the cards feel downright mean rather than nasty and fun (even with the errata'ed "Dud" cards). In the end I realised I would almost always rather play something else, so it had to go.

Different sort of dungeon crawl.  Haven't played enough to say whether I like it or not.  Seems like it could definitely scratch the itch without being too fiddly, though the play length doesn't seem like it would be much shorter than something like Descent though for this lesser fiddliness.

I love this game. Easy to learn, easy to play, medium to master. Scenarios have to be balanced well for proper gameplay, and this has been proven to be a problem for 4 players (out of the box) but just like the PC version, this game is extremely modifiable to suit your own tastes.
As long as you like DOOM. And blasting things to bits.
Time required to play through a scenario can be a little daunting.

RATING: 9
An enjoyable fairly cooperative game (with easy to learn rules)... it can however, be too difficult or too easy (depending on which "mods" are used), and some marine combinations are better than others.  Like any other cooperative game, the fun had can be based on the energy of the group you're playing with.

Set up can be a bit annoying.

Mods are necessary, but worth it.

Mods:

With 3 players, the Overlord just draws 2 cards per turn.

Guns you pick on the map come with an ammo token.

Marines can go in any order (i.e. Blue first on one turn, Red first on the second turn.)

We deal each marine 1 special card, then deal each marine 3 cards (and each marine picks one of those 3 ... use 5 cards if you have the expansion), and then all remaining cards are put into the center and each marine picks one.

Expansion rules for the Dud card.

Pistols have unlimited ammo.

This might be high since the game needs more plays, but i really enjoyed this game.  My biggest problem with Descent is how little chance the overlord has of winning, or at least competing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played Descent a few times, liked it quite a bit but felt it was too long for me. So I sought out this game instead and picked it up used. Though it's still pretty long, I quite like it.

Owner's bias? Maybe a little, but to me it improves (even if slightly) some of the things I didn't like about Descent, like its length, the fiddly fatigue management, overdone generic fantasy theme, and the difficulty the overlord has in having even a chance at winning. Doom plays like a streamlined and (slightly) faster Descent.

The last point about overlord/invader difficulty is worth elaborating on. Out of the box Doom is too hard for the marines, and I'd argue that Descent goes a little too far the other way, that the extra restrictions make it too hard for the overlord. Which is easier to adjust and compensate for, though? The card costs make it hard for the overlord in Descent to suddenly toughen the game if the other players have a too-easy time. But in Doom you can easily hold back if your opponents are having too hard a time. It's a bit easier to "game" the system to ensure everyone has a fun experience.

Of course, Descent is a lot better than Doom in a number of ways... but for the most part, the things it improves upon aren't really things I value, and for me they don't make the extra length worth it.  But I don't blame anyone else for preferring Descent, and I expect I'm in the minority.

I love Doom (the video game).  The game can take awhile.  I prefer with two people, I think.

Feb 2017 - I haven't played this in some time but have been thinking about this game since the new version came out.  I need to get this one back to the table.  Like many, and from reading about the new version, the story telling part of this is pretty awesome.  I was a fan of DOOM, DOOM II, DOOM III, Quake and that was a big part for me.  I also (yah strange) love the fact that it is very difficult to win as the marine.  If you play four, you MUST work hard as a team to sniff a chance at winning.  

I want to get back into this.

RATING: 7
Another FFG game, another regret.  I really wish FFG would release just one instant 5 star game because it's so obvious that they could do it.  Unfortunately, Doom is not it.  First, the game definitely runs too long.  I think a tighter game with shorter scenarios, but smaller marine frag pool would not only alleviate this problem but make for a better game.  The game's attempt to make the scenarios attrition battles doesn't work and contributes to the much maligned balance problems.

See, I figure the designers in trying to capture a sense of scarcity of resources for the marines went to far and thus shorted them too much on ammo and generally biased the game toward the Invader.  Thankfully, a few simple tweaks (borrowed from the expansion) fixes many of the problems, though the scenarios could use some work.

Other criticisms of the game feel depressingly redolent of most FFG games; FFG has an annoying habit of keeping things in the game they obviously should have chucked. For instance, some of the weapons don't really distinguish themselves and only appear as some kind of thematic homage to the computer game.  The marine cards also suffer some rather obvious imbalances and tie too specifically to certain weapons which devalues one of the more intriguing questions during the game, "who do we give that weapon to?"

Nevertheless, the game manages to generate excitement and is above all fun.  It provides enough tactics to keep the players interested and balances that with, literally, more visceral fun.  Nothing beats sweeping around with your chainsaw and killing a horde of demons.  Also, the dice system exudes charm and ingenuity and deserves emulation in other games.

Wow! Game play is quick, easy to learn, and FUN! The heart of the game is the combat system which uses a single roll of the dice to determine whether you: hit your opponent (or not), the damage done, and whether you burned up ammo or not. Clever card play by the GM/Invader will really keep the marines on their toes! A better FPS than the Frag boardgame, this is possibly the best bug-hunt game since Space Hulk! I'm very happy that Fantasy Flight are taking on the task of making the sort of lavish board games that Games Workshop used to make.

I like almost everything about this game. The weapons are well designed in the different ways they work. The monsters seem overwhelming and scary. The scarcity of resouces makes the game tense. The two sides of the game play differently and entertainingly poised against each other in the card draws. It's got real tactical play and immersive theme. I would rate this game an 8 or even a 9 if not for the game length. It just drags near the end. Even in the web scenario designed especially to be short, the game long overstayed its welcome. It's a shame because everything else works like gangbusters.

This game takes up the entire table and because of the sheer amount of bits and peaces and lack of organisation in the box needs extra boxes and ziplocks to keep everything tidy.

Doom the boardgame captivates the theme of the video game really well, the odds for the marines are against them. The game uses a very clever dice system to determine the effects in one throw (range, damage, ammo expenditure). It feels heavy on tactics and low on strategy, however after every play one immediately realises that a different strategy would be needed to defeat the monsters.
It does take a lot of time to play (and to set up and clean up), so it doesn't get a lot of playtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First game played, we all enjoyed ourselves.  The game is similar to Descent, but the approach that the marines must take seems to be different.  I can see situations where you'd want to simply leave invaders behind you and push forward.  Rush ahead a bit more and use your orders to allow you to take advantage of the weapon abilities (like sweep, blowthrough).  I'm impressed!  We'll be adopting a couple of the suggested modifications from the expansion.  The marines controlling their activation order is a must, and I think we'll go with unlimited ammo for pistols as well.  That should help the marines out some in the short term while we're still learning the game.

More plays in, and we're tweaking the shotgun so that it cannot roll zero range.  Having a marine not roll a miss and still miss an adjacent target due to zero range rolled is very frustrating for the players.  With that, pistols taking no ammo and deploying an extra ammo token with each weapon on the board, the balance of the scenarios seems good.  As we get better at the game we may scale these houserules back a bit.

The most challenging rpg board game I own. And its a GOOD challenge. Its not easy to win. Plays just like the Doom 3 video game. For those that play it the first time, DO NOT be deterred by its complexity and length needed to play. Some of the rules can sometimes seem odd and querky and conflicting but they really do work out. Once  you get the rules down the second time around is much more smooth and much more enjoyable with the challenging complexity to win. They made this game so you MUST SURVIVE and STRIVE to win! Fantasy flight games did a great job and I highly suggest to those that love uncovering "dungeon crawl" like aspects to games you'll love this tabletop version of the video game.

I play with some house rules and changes to make it slightly easier for the marines for newbies to the game. The marines start with one additional card compared to the rules.

Love the miniatures and the board pieces, they really help to adhance the fun and enjoyment of the game. And the premade scenarios really help out and make the game awesome to play!

A long long time ago... I can hardly remember.

I really liked Doom and when my little brother came up with the boardgame I was thrilled (back then before I got into boardgaming).

Well, it is a pretty solid dungeon crawl and maybe the father of the newer ones...
...but somehow it didn't click for me.
I liked the Dungeons and Dragons: The Fantasy Adventure Board Game and my old Dark World more, although both are inferior considering the mechanics.
Maybe if I'd give it another chance...but now I have Descent 2nd Ed. and Imperial Assault... and Conan coming.
I bet that wouldn't be fair.

RATING: 5.5
I'm still on the fence about this game. I think it has some real potential, but it is dangerously unbalanced and swingy. In particular, I find that it sometimes straddles the line between being a tactical, squad combat game with fun skirmish rules (which I like) and a light pseudo-rpg (which I dislike). Note: it isn't that I dislike rpgs, but rather that I don't find the narratives generated by the game sufficiently compelling for this to be the primary focus. Some of the invader cards (such as the one that causes players to lose their orders) just seem like screwage for screwage's sake. They don't add to immersion; they just make the marine player(s) feel like they've wasted their actions.

That said, I've also had some real fun playing it. Something tells me that this is a game that I will need to balance for myself (using different combinations of the printed variants), but unfortunately the 3-hour playtime will make this winnowing process a fairly long one.

Also: weapon breaking variant = not fun!

RATING: 7.5
Altough the game is not that original, it plays really good. Materials are of stunning quality and the minitures are well detailed and in some cases really large (look at the Hellknight or at the CyberDemon). A nice element of the game is a fun implementation of the role of the "master", who is effectively playing along with other players, and not only arranging the game for them. Playing as the master can be as enjoyable as playing as a marine.
Rules can be a little confusing at times, due to some poor explaination on the manual. A good game, indeed.

RATING: 6
Decent dungeon crawl game, but way too LONG.  The marines spend a lot of time just trying to cover LOS to prevent spawning which isn't fun.  Running out of ammo after one shot is just stupid.  Not sure I'll play this one much more.

Update: After buying Descent I have sold Doom.  I enjoy Descent a lot better.  The Doom expansion might have fixed the things about Doom that I didn't care for, but the fantasy theme of Descent appeals to me more anyway.

RATING: 5
As play continues, it becomes apparent that a) the balance of this game is ludicrously off - the marines are hosed; and b) it takes too bloody long. Good for the right crowd, yes; a well-designed game, no. My original comments: Hey, this is actually pretty fun. Blast stuff, and with a few tactics to boot. The dice are really clever. Probably good for at least 5 plays. Still, you wouldn't mistake this for a eurogame - a lot of the balances are significantly off, and like too many Fantasy Flight games, it needed a decent developer and more development time. Too many weapons, too much variance in the Marine "special powers" deck (and some powers that make the game *less* interesting, which is not good). Ammo is too scarce. The game is not properly scaled for 2 (too boring) or 4 (murderous on the Marines) players. And the game is somewhere between a touch too long and significantly too long.

But it's still a rather interesting game. Definitely not great, but a decently fun game, and I'm not disappointed with my purchase. We'll see if it hangs on longer than War of the Ring did. I'm optimistic.

Update on that list bit: ah, no. Not even close. War of the Ring had issues, but nothing on the scale of Doom.

Yes, I am a little bitter about this game. Not so much because it's horrible, which it definitely isn't, but because it's such a colossal missed opportunity. FFG had a bunch of good ideas, which they then threw into a box without any regard to development or playtesting. If they had an even minimally competant playtest group or development process, this could have been quite a good game. But they didn't, and it's not.

While it lacks the polish of Descent, Doom remains a pretty solid game. I think any fan of the video game series will enjoy it. It has a lot of the flavor and atmosphere of Doom 3. The biggest flaw with the game is the balance. In most scenarios it's pretty much impossible for the marines to win. It's more about how long you can survive rather than IF you can survive. The lack of ammo and the ease at which the Invader play his cards really hurts the game.

Great components and a fun system.  It can be a bit tough for the Marines however.  This game would absolutely be a "9" or "10" only that the players have to figure out exactly how they wish to modify the game in order to make it work for themselves in particular.  It is definitely worth the time and effort involved but like I said, if it came out of the box just a tiny bit more refined then it would get top marks.

The best way to play IMO is with two Marines and with each weapon supplied with an ammo counter.  Giving the Marines 3 armour to start with can be a good balance too.

The above ammo "mod" is one of the official mods from the Expansion Set.  The expansion is a "must have" I think.

Worth the price of admission for the cool miniatures :)

RATING: 7
I was slightly skeptical at first about how well a board game could emulate the feel of one of the most iconic FPS computer games ever.  As it turns out I needn't have worried.

Doom pits 1-3 players as Marines ("Doom Guys") against one GM-style player who controls all of the various monsters and demons.  The game is built around an RPG-style format, with optional campaign rules linking one mission to the next.

The game feels very stacked against the Marines, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A good GM can adjust his play style to make the game fun for everyone.

My biggest complaint is that whenever the players enter a new area of the map the setup takes a while.  One can imagine a "Loading..." dialog appearing on-screen.  With some preparation ahead of time it's not so bad, but it does limit the game somewhat.

The playing pieces are decent quality.  The sculpts are attractive, and the plastic is firmer (and more brittle) than other FFG games (e.g. Talisman), so the pieces don't flex as much.

Overall it's a pretty fun game for the right group of people.

RATING: 4
Meh.  Like "Zombies!!!", but with a little more detail and production values.  Almost as tiresome.  Good gamemaster required, otherwise game drags significantly.

It seemed to me that "fisting" in this game produced far more damage than was my experience with the video game.  In the video game, if all you have left is your fist, you're pretty much toast, and soon.

Only one play, it comes straight out the same mold as Heroquest and Space Hulk. The invader player's card play made it unpredictable and exciting. The marine player's seemed a bit restricted with no clever little combos or set plays they could pull out. It would have been nice if we had had our own decks. Other players were complaining about the balance of the game and the way the invader player held us in the first rooms which left us screwed for the rest of the game.

A pretty fun dungeon-crawl game.  One issue is the time it takes to set-up the dungeon in between rooms.  I think waiting to set them up until a door is open is sort of jarring to the flow of the game.  Might not be "that" detrimental to set up the whole board beforehand, tokens included.  Or at least have the right tokens for each room ready to go.  UPDATE: I would much rather play Descent than this one, so there doesn't seem to be as much reason to keep it.

A boy´s toys dream! Well, the game is beautiul to look at and as veteran Hero Quest player it didn´t let me unimpressed. The problem is, as marine player it´s so damn difficult!

Doom is the first generation of FFG dungeon crawl type of games. You can feel the rules are cluncky compared to decent and there is also a lot less options. It was fun but there is much better games now that are played almost the same way. The only reason I would play again is for the theme.

This one's absolutely terrific and absolutely terrifying! You'll find yourself remembering the great time you had playing DOOM on your PC back in '93, even by going through the rulebook, seeing how many aspects of the videogame have been incorporated to this boardgame. The adpatation is truly spot-on and the components are excellent!

UPDATE: Raised from 8 to 10 after a nail-biting edge-of-our-seats game session that saw the marines make it out of the board in the nick of time! The image alone of 4 full-grown adults jumping around over the final deciding Demon free attack dice roll is just worth that 10 on its own...

Dear Kevin Wilson,  I have to admit that even though I didn't care much for your past designs I always saw potential for more.  I always knew you had something like Doom in you. You have produced a game that is as good, and in many ways better than some of my favorite 1980s games like Space Hulk.  I love the combat system, the cards are fun, and the components- forget about it!  You really hit the nail on the head in terms of translating the video game experience to a board game- and not losing any of the fun, quickness, or insane slaughter.  Thanks so much for this, the last new game I'll play in 2004.  You've really capped it off nicely sir, and all I can say is BRING ON AN EXPANSION SET IN HELL!!!!  Sincerely, M.

A very fun game. Lots of atmosphere. Not the deepest game but the team play adds greatly to the fun. How can you roll 10 misses on 18 attempts at a punch. Statistically you should only miss 3 of them. My code name Organ Donar seems to be appropriate in the Board Game version as well. Not sure this has staying power for me at least. Its a cooperative RPG type of game so it has camaraderie and the appeal of leveling up but really there is no deep strategy.

The components are fantastic.  I really like the concept.  Unfortunatly after giving this game a darn good shot I always beat the crap out of my players and no one ever won a map.  Even with the FFG alternate rules for easing the difficulty I still layed the smack down with impunity.  It sucked all hope of winning from my players, then again it is called "DOOM."  It will get played again, maybe but not anytime soon.  Everyone would rather play Descent.

Dices for that one are horrible, they wear off quickly and are hard to be replaced. Poor choice of scenarios limits replayability - there are just five available in the campaign, even though they are very difficult to be completed. A player controlling Invaders can be considered to be a GM (game master) due to how much his possibilities and scenario knowledge are greater comparing with Marines. To make matters worse, most things are dice controlled. Unless Invader cares about opponents' satisfaction from playing, Marines IMO can't stand long enough against his minions. Long scenarios and tons of dice results to be calculated can be tiring, which spoils the remnants of fun coming from those less lucky games for Marines.

However, all components look great, especially painted. If you can deal with things mentioned above, the game will be worth of its price for you.

RATING: 9
I've owned the game since it game out back in 05'. My copy has seen a hundred or more plays over the years. The original dice have actually been tossed so much that they've become somewhat more rounded on the edges and also lost the images on the sides.

The components are great. The combat can be a bit random at times (well, you are tossing dice, so duh) and this can be a bit of a turnoff to some people. The game is clearly slanted for invader victory. I usually play the invader and I tend to take the printed campaign instructions a bit loosely - adding more ammo here and there and maybe not adding that extra archvile which should have spawned. The marines almost always make through the levels with 5 deaths out of 6. So yes, if the invader always optimizes his play (even with the more marine friendly rules/cards in the expansion) the marines really have no chance of winning.

I also own Descent but it's not as much fun as this Doom boardgame is. Maybe because in Descent the heroes are practically guaranteed to win and that is quite boring.

The expansion set is a must have. It adds a lot of nice things. All the new monsters in it are pretty much better in every way - which makes marines' lives even more difficult - so I find it even more fun to play as the invader as I really have to secretly try and gimp myself and not win. :)

Doom is the smaller and more elegant sister of Descent. It features the same great mechanics without all of the bloat. It also suffers from this however since some of the "bloat" in Descent is really awesome. Both games are about equal in my eyes. If I want a more thematic, immersive game with less "game" I go for Descent. If I'm the mood for a tactical miniature battle I play Doom.

The miniatures for this game are some of the best (and biggest) of any game I own, and the art direction for the boards/cards is fantastic.  I love how well it represents the video game, and I like the co-op aspect of it.  I don't like having to play the Game Master every time.

Juego super divertido, ademas tiene unos escenarios que parecen sacados de una pelicula.
Comparandolo con descent.....despues de jugar varias partidas a ambos, puedo decir que descent es mas profundo y completo, pero mas aburrido para el overlord, en cambio doom es mas rapido, opresivo para los jugadores y divertido para el invasor.

This game is fun despite the imbalance.  We are still working on the perfect set of house rules to make this game playable for the marines.  Over a number of plays, the marines still have not had an honest chance at winning.  Despite this, I still have a good time playing.  The expansion is supposed to solve some of these issues, but I have not taken the plunge yet.

Space Hulk: The Next Generation. Needs tweaking or an incompetent invader player for balance with four players. Playing with multiple marines is the only way to play for the full range of tactical options (over watch etc). Card & dice luck is a little more extreme than SH. I like the concept & production quality though.

Fantasy Flight continues to be an industry leader for components, but  unfortunately the gameplay isn't quite on par with all the purty bits.  Contant combat, ammo burn and weapon breakage often result in a frustrating time for the Marines.  Still, the game is called "Doom" (and not "Cakewalk") for a reason.  Tactical thinking and teamwork are a must in this game, which is why I still like it a lot.  Despite the frustrations, I'll never refuse a chance to frag me some Imps.

Wow, this game is heavy and it looks so cool, Mutant Chronicles on steroids. :)

It doesn't play that bad either. The main problem apart from trying to balance the game is that it is funnier to be a marine than the invaders, but as long as you rotate that it shold be ok.

RATING: 6
A big box of bits.  Players play either one of three marines against the single Invader player.  The marines are trying to accomplish some sort of mission, moving their miniature across an ever growing board, while fighting off the hordes of beasties belonging to the invader player.  This game is very remisicent of the Space Crusade/Space Hulk genre, however it's an improvement.  The game appears to be more varied and interesting, with well designed scenarios, lots of stuff to pick up (weapons, etc).  The dice system that tracks hits, damage and ammo expenditure with one roll is very clever.  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Futuristic dungeon crawl that leaves me cold. There's a good amount of decisions but it never allows for too much creatice approaches for the marines. It plays pretty smoothly once you add a few "mods" [ie: patches to glaring faults that weren't caught in playtesting]. 

But Doom lacks the robust simplicity and fun of Space Hulk. It provides less intersting decisions and happens at a slower pace.

This game captures the feel of the video game very well.  There may be some balance issues, but the system is very ameable to house rules, so I see this as easily fixed.  I actually enjoy the challenge of the initial scenarios - you just have to make sure the marine players understand they they are not supposed to succeed the first time through - they need to figure out the tricks!  The single roll combat system is very well implemented.
I think that DOOM and Descent have diferent priorities - DOOM is a much more intense experience, while Descent is more of an adventure.

UPDATE: July 2013.  I purchased and played Descent 2nd Ed.  I fully expected that it would replace DOOM for me.  But you know what?  I still think DOOM is the best iteration of the system.  It gets you to the cool parts, namely tactics, upgrades, and dice chucking, with much less fuss.  The DOOM levels are just the right length for a play session, whereas the shorty D2 levels involve a good amount of setup for a small amount of game.  I did not find the "leveling up" of D2 to be all that engaging either - it just meant everyone can dish out and take more damage. Bigger numbers doesn't feel a whole lot like progression.  For me, the variable upgrades in DOOM vs. the different monsters (+ expansion) give a better feeling of variety with less hassle.  DOOM forever!

It is certainly the pre-cursor to Descent.  However, this does not make a strictly inferior game.  It is not so complex as Descent and it takes significantly shorter time to finish a scenario on average.  Also, if you like guns+demons more than swords+monsters you might like the theme a little more.  In short, a good light RPBG.

I was skeptical at first. I'm not a huge Doom fan to begin with. The premise of the game is a bit corny. You can almost imagine what went on in the ID meeting prior to the release of the original game:

Marketing guy: "So, from a marketing standpoint, do we want to have our marines battling against undead, demons, or cyborgs?"

Staff: "Yeah!!!!!"

Marketing guy: "Which one?"

Staff: "What YOU said! That's sounds awesome!!!"


Space Hulk was a great and innovative game for it's day, and it's still a pretty good game by today's standards. Doom is better developed, and there is much more variety in the invaders and weapons. I was expecting something fun but "fluffy."  Instead, we have a tight tactical game here. Reminds me more of the old X-COM computer game than Doom. But I mean that in a good way. 

The combat system and dice are very innovative. This is one of the best simple combat systems I've played to date. Game play is a blast. And if that's not enough... you get tons o' goodies in the box. I felt like a little kid on Christmas day when I opened the box and saw all the plastic creatures in there. 

But great components don't make a great game... luckily, Doom is a great game. 

On the downside... I think I liked the scenarios from Space Hulk better (the role-play aspect of Doom is a bit cheesy for my tastes, and I don't like the hidden information whereby you populate an area once the marines enter it).  The game is also a bit too long for it's own good. The 1-2 hour playtime on the box is pretty ludicrous, even for a single scenario. But maybe we're just slow players. All that said, these minor gripes don't detract (much) from an innovative and enjoyable game.

This game is made even better by the expansion, which adds the deathmatch and CTF game types.

Doom: The Boardgame is an interesting game in my opinion. In my first game played, it was a 3 player vs. 3 player with expansion. Doom: The Boardgame reminded me of Space Hulk a little. It was more fun than I would of thought. Also reminded me of the video game shooter, running after real players. The game is well done with the expansion.

I retried the game with 2 players. This time, without the expansion. The rules are not that well written. We had a difficult time during the game. Probably because Doom: The Boardgame has some balance issues. It's very tough for the marines. A game can last a long time.

This time around, it was a bit less enjoyable than the first time I played. Probably due to the fact that when I played the first time, the person explaining knew the rules inside and out. Also, I played against other players instead of aliens since we played with the expansion. The expansion made it more balances the game and adds so much to it.

Always play with the expansion in my opinion. Try out the play 3 vs. 3  If you still want to play without the expansion (or you don't have it), modify some rules.

Got in a math trade.

RATING: 7
Despite a rather direct translation from the computer game I've found this game has delivered each time it's been played.  

It is a tough game for the marines, but I think that's something that makes this game worthwhile.  The players are challenged to make sure each of their moves counts and they need to coordinate their efforts.

For the invader player, while it is tough on the marine players you still need to think in order to make it challenging if everyone involved are rather equal in their game playing strengths.  The card draw for the invader creates feasts and famines over the course of play for the invader and so if you are going to get the frags you need to win you'll need to plan a little ahead to make sure you can swarm a marine.

Great components, themed mechanics which are nonetheless light and quick, an interesting dice mechanic, it's a good package.

Eventually though it was eclipsed with Descent and just started collecting dust.  Sold it on ebay.

Doom: the boardgame is a good example of bad game design. It isn't bad game but it suffers from baddly written rulebook and few foolish rules. It really spoils the gaming experience when I can get killed in purpose and use respwaning to advance in game. It is stupid and feel that I'm cheating. And there are many more stupid rules that bugs me. After some rule upgrades and fixes helps. But why am I doing game designers work. Why does publishers use us as their lab rats. I demand that games are finished before they are publsihed. Unfinished game spoils gaming experience and makes you feel cheated.

Played once.  This is a long game, although it can be fast if players are familiar with the rules and they play by the seat of their pants, which is how the game is best played.

RATING: 9
nice components, cool theme, endless possibilities (sounds chessy, i know), no game is like another

the way things are handeled works very smooth and fast, the dice system is really cool and well thought out, the interlocking tiles (like in space hulk) give way to uncountable layouts of hightech complexes on mars...
the special abilities of monsters and weapons alike have a good feeling and allow for good tactical gaming. the aspect of inavder cards gives the game that everchanging feeling, you can play the same set again and agein, but since the cards a different from play to play you'll never know what will hit you. further, one is not bound by any restrictions as in so far that you can create your own game setups. the game is a lot of fun (see my session report), easy to learn rules (but with a lot of depth to it) and that bit of something which is needed to make a game feel good.
for the future i hope there will be expansions to fill in the ranks of invaders (since it's based upon doom 3, i hope they will come sooner or later, well rathr sooner than later.), some more tiles and cards to juice up the possibilities.
but for a start it simply rocks.

Update: 1.5 Invader Cards per turn variant with 3 marine is a simple, elegant balance solution. Still a bit long, but fun!

I really want to rate this one higher. But frankly the game is horribly imbalanced out of the box in favor for the invader. 

We tried many balance fixes, including drawing 2 cards with 3 marines and multiple variations on picking skill cards for marines, and the game is still strongly in favor of the invader.

In 7 plays, as me being the invader 6 times, the marines never won, not even once. Now I'm a good strategist, but still. 

Despite that, the game was a lot of fun. I think once I find a simple and elegant solution to balance the game I will rate it higher.

(I'm thinking something along the lines that invader always draws 2 cards even with 3 marines, and all weapons come with 2 ammo, and marines starting only their first life with 1 armor).

If you play this, you should totally put on some old school doom music in the background. Totally adds to the atmosphere :)

Oh the fond memories... DOOM was practically my first FPS I played on my father's old computer back then, and it gave me the creeps! Such a tense atmosphere, scary monsters, cool graphics (for the time!) and a thrilling soundtrack. Now, many years later, after the remake of the original DOOM for the PC, all this was combined and packed into an exciting boardgame to recreate the deadly missions for the Marines. Save mankind from imminent doom and jump right in! Cool miniatures, a modular board, some missions (and many more available online) make up for some fun! And it has a BFG, too! What more can I say?

If you're going to play with three marines, getting the difficulty cards from FFG's site is CRITICAL.  Default difficulty is literally impossible for all but the most insanely unlikely random chances.  Try "I'm Too Young to Die!" for a good, DIFFICULT challenge for the marines.  1 or 2 marines is much easier.

*update:  Ok, after much playing, I'm revising my review down from a 9.0.  The severe balance issues combined with the long playing time just make this game extremely frustrating.  There's a great game in there, maybe the expansion will bring it out.

Based on 41 plays.
+ Very exciting game. Unforgettable moments.
+ Custom scenarios with TileSystem software.
+ Streamlined rules work better than in Descent.
+ The monsters are unique. No more half-baked elves and dwarves.
> I haven't played Doom 3 videogame myself. I hear the boardgame simulates the video game rather well.
> The game has some imbalance but it doesn't bother me too much. Instead of seeking a technical win, Invader player should create a tight endgame at all costs.
> Use the alternative rules introduced in the expansion set.
- Base game includes only five (longish) scenarios. Fortunately we have TileSystem!

Updated (after a half a year in 2007, 8-->9): Still full of excitement.
Updated 9->10 in 2011 after 41 plays. There's no question about it. Who in their right mind would paint the miniatures, produce alternative rules, design new scenarios, and answer questions on BGG, if the game was bad? Not me!

Doom is a really fun crawler, you play marines vs. one invader player. each marine has his own attributes which spice things up and make you feel for your marine. The invaders get the distinct pleasure of setting the mood, by being inherantly evil and reading off the "setting text" as each area is explored. Ive played with 2 marines vs. invader and it was quite fun!

Ótimo jogo. Bastante temático e para quem já jogou Doom no PC a versão de tabuleiro é bastante fiel.
Basicamente é um jogo semi cooperativo. Invasor contra os Marines onde os jogadores movem-se e atacam pelos corredores e sala, podendo fazer mais um que o outro dependendo da situação. Basicamente um action points. Fora isso tem dezenas de particularidades nas regras que reproduzem o jogo de PC. Os cenários são bastante interessante, especialmente, se o jogador que controla os invasores souber narrar. É um jogo pesado em tempo, 3 a 4 horas de partida, mas as regras são relativamente fáceis.
Vale a pena conferir.

For Doom PC veteran, this one is a must have, as this boardgame version manages to recreate the original atmosphere adding the advantages of boardgaming (joining friends, drinks and laughs...)
The system is quite smart, although due to the level of realism the playtime can be a bit excessive, namely in the board preparation stage. This time factor, has meant that I'm having difficulties in getting people to get excited into playing it.

RATING: 4
Great bits, and Descent proves that the system can work just fine, brought down quite a few points by the lopsided chances at victory. Bores me to death as the Invader (Too easy, you're basically forced to play nice to even get beyond the first few turns), frustrated almost everyone I tried it with (Too hard for the marines, not even I ever saw a chance for any of them).
Requires either a remarkably incompetent Invader player or godlike Marines players to reach any semblance of balance.

There are lots of thing I love about this game. Firstly, and the most obvious as it's apparent even at a cursory glance, is the production value. The board pieces, cards and tokens look great, and the minis are very nice looking and huge! Secondly, it really captures the feel and atmosphere of the computer game original, even if gameplay itself is very different. Thirdly, the small unit tactics and cooperative gameplay the marine players get. Not that many games lend themselves easily to good cooperative gameplay, this is one though, and it does it extremely well. And last, the difficulty. Yes, it can be very hard for the marine players, but to me, that's a good thing, because again, it helps capture the feel of the computer game. All in all, it's an tactical, action packed, turn based cooperative game, and one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.

The pieces are great, but the scenarios are severely stacked against the marines if the ammo rules are used as written. In the first play, we got the marines almost to the end, but the final room destroyed them all. Forget a campaign! Still fun, but needs some house rules for ammo.

RATING: 2
Interesting enough, with a fair challenge yet it still doesn't provide the spark for me that Lord of the Rings does with the Sauron expansion.  I will play again, and will enjoy my playing but the DM (for lack of a better term) seems more controlled by the scenario and has little to do. Where as in LOTR I feel Sauron has interesting decisions to make.

UPDATE:
wow, I just trekked through another game of this and my rating dropped considerably.  this game offers no real choices, is horribly balanced, and for a translation of a kinetic shooter to a boardgame fails miserably (expected I suppose).  The game plods along and never offers any real atmosphere.  This one is best left on the computer where it actually offers an exciting experience.

I really enjoyed the theme and the experience of this game, but it's hard to put together a group willing to play it, then once you do, it has a lot of setup time with tons of bits. As far as actually playing the game, we've done the first scenario a few times and the second one many, many times with no success. This game is really, really hard for the marines unless the GM is terrible.

I really wanted this game even though the game length is a little too long and probably to hard for me to ever get to the table with the opponents I have. Thus, it's unplayed and unrated as of yet. I didn't plan on buying it because I highly doubt my wife will like it, which also limits it's playability for me, but I found a gently used copy locally for $20! I couldn't resist. That was worth it even if i only ever get to play it once.

The mechanics of the game are brilliant. Especially the way one die roll determines everything while attacking: range, damage and expenditure of ammo.

Good idea, but FFG didn't get it right until their second try.

- games run over an hour (which is pushing the younger kid's attention span)
- Painted dice + rolled a LOT means they'll wear out and etched dice are apparently considered family heirlooms by those that own them...grumble grumble grumble...

We play this as a group of four and had an absolute blast.  Our Invader player played more like a GM, ensuring that the other players had fun. (Instead of playing dud all the time on their ammo!)  For a great time playing this, the Invader should not be a total sadist. Very good game with the right crowd.  I've played a few times as the invaders with my kids as the marines.  They love it, but get a little scared at times :)

RATING: 7
Atmospheric (!) and downright difficult for the marines. If you like co-op than Doom delivers; 2-3 players discussing how best to keep the party alive is a blast. Gorgeous looking game with large detailed miniatures (though the colours are a bit icky). Needs some tweaking to improve the marine's chances, but all in all a decent game by FFG. Caveat - the game takes way too long but perhaps that's just us..

I sold Doom in anticipation of Descent but I think Doom is actually better. With Space Hulk 3E sitting pretty on the shelf I don't think I'll be re-buying Doom anytime soon...

Received in a trade. This was definitely a player's copy. Some of the mini's are painted, which is fine.

Houserules are a must to enjoy this as the marine player:

1. Give the marines an armor value of 3.
2. Give them an extra ammo token everytime they pick a weapon.

RATING: 7
My rating assumes you incorporate the essential expansion set, and that you restrict yourself to the shorter scenarios available on the web. They did a very nice job of compressing weapons range, damage done, and special weapon effects into a simple, graphical chart and a special set of colored dice. Nice plastic pieces (that look much better when painted). Assymetrical strategies required of the monster and marine players (and the marines really must work together if they are to survive). Likely to have great appeal to fans of games like Zombies and (especially) Space Hulk. The game tends to be long and you'll likely run out of fun before you run out of game, but it's not bad if you stick to the shorter, fan-made scenarios. It is full of blood and monsters, so of course my kids love it. I am slowly warming to this one and my rating is creeping up. Purchase of the expansion proved inevitable.

This was a rough-draft of what ultimately became Fantasy Flight's DESCENT franchise, with DOOM licensing slapped on. This is a terrible game in my opinion and plays every bit like an unfinished jumble of mechanics and ideas. It feels like one that wasn't beta-tested, to keep with the video game analogy.

I'm not normally a fan of wargame/tabletop mini strategy fests. And asymmetrical games are usually turn-offs.  But I have two words explaining my like/love of Doom the Boardgame: Chainsaw Warrior.  Outstanding theme and atmosphere.  Easy to learn and get playing (after the set-up time, which is substantial when you first open the box).

The final nail in the coffin is the utter randomness of the scenarios, and specifically how outcomes that win or lose the game hinge on die rolls unrelated to the fiddly, My First Grognard minutiae of combat and turn-based tactics.

It is already tough for the Marines. Even with the plodding fiddly inch-by-inch wargaming strategies and tactics that must be employed to give one a fighting chance, all can be lost in an instant - and not by a misplay or miscalculation on your part. 

To play as well as you can, with the deck already literally stacked against you, only to be held hostage by a "flavor" text-fueled random die result which you read from the scenario booklet and which may instantly end the game with "You Die" is brutal and invalidates the experience. Even if it's closer thematically to Doom the videogame. 

And since these "surprises" are one-shots they are literally spoilers that spoil gameplay and willingness to replay. Just because that dynamic accurately portrays the original video game, doesn't make it a viable board game mechanic. It doesn't make me want to re-start and work my way up and past the last place I fragged. At least in first-person shooters you can get through it more quickly than this analog plodder.

DESCENT is a game our group has played and campaigned with. The theme and chrome and flavor and, yes, randomness, are much better suited to that game, which is more of an RPG-hybrid. This one doesn't have that luxury to fall back on, which is why it fails. But at least from the ashes of DOOM rose Descent, and Fantasy Flight's rise to success in the booming industry.

Boardgame played with miniatures where players try to escape from board based on computer game. Game balance is awful favoring bad guy player. Even the first easiest mission is too hard even with expansions sets I´m too young to die difficulty level. Game pieces are excellent quality and there's plenty of them. Game pieces are Doom 3 style but I'm hope they would be more original Doom 1 and 2 style for nostalgic feel. I also hoped a competive factor for this game.

RATING: 6
First rating is a '6'.
I played the invader, my buddy the marine. Ammo was never a problem for him. Most of the time he 'worked' in melee with the chainsaw and rolled nice. And indeed, there was seldom a position for him, where he could stay in distance and fight me in range fire.
All in all I like it. I also enjoy the Dungeons & Dragons Boardgame. What I like in Doom more then there - there are triggered events within the scenario - so it's more adventure within all the hack&slay.

RATING: 8.5
Bought again after a 10 yr hiatus. i have found tactical minis boardgames are my thing. Doom is fun, brutal, and very challenging, rating little lower than I would like to give, but this is due to game bogging down with board layout, slowing things.

Painted

Also own the expansion, which adds:

New Fixed Deck. Replacement components for non ideal base set parts. Another full set of minis. Adds capture the flag and Deathmatch mode. Plus loads more. A perfect example of what an expansion should do/add

Great thematic game.

RATING: 7
A really good small-unit tactics game, pretty hard on the marines, but beatable with some luck and the right teamwork. Not an easy run through, though, not at all. Usually, the invader will win, definitely in the first games.

The dice mechanics that this game introduced stand strong to this day in Descent, which had a lot more success (probably due to theme and ease of access). It is great because it lets you see at a glance how much damage you do, how far you shoot, and whether you misfire or use ammo.

I also painted most of the minis, including custom marines, still haven't finished the bosses though :cry:

Just writing this makes me want to play this one again...

Nice to have if you cannot grab a copy of Space Hulk, or if you want to have somehow similar experience wit 3  players.
The bits quality, and especially the puzzle board, are even better than Space Hulk was, kudos for that. 

Much better with the expansion set, would never play again without it
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rating dropped from 6 to 4.  After a few more plays with 3 marines, it has become obvious this game is unbalanced.  Although the monsters scale up with the number of players, the ammunition does not so you are sharing whatever is on that level with the extra players.  Perhaps it works better with 1 or 2 marines?  With a full complement of (3) marine players, the object is not really to fight, but to run to the exit.

For what it is, the game it too long.  The interlocking "map" pieces are nice, so are most of the plastic minis.  The larger monsters have a warped base.

Another issue is with the writing on the special dice, which wears off after about 12 games.

The game is pretty interesting. It is very hard for the player characters. The first few times I played this it was fun. The main issue that I have with the game is that there is few missions and you tend to learn them quickly if you play them multiple times. Also the character abilities and what you get is really important as the game is really hard. So first games are good but re-playability is low.

Now that I have a new game group, the old comment was no longer relevant.  I have a love/hate relationship with this game.  On one hand, I love the intense and varied gameplay.  Some turns, Marines are wiping out Invaders and having a blast throwing dice and cleaning house.  Other turns, the Marines are struggling to live.  Actually, most turns the Marines are struggling to live, as this game is terribly, terribly balanced for the Invader.  It makes campaign play with the base game an impossibility, as the missions are just too difficult to beat more than 2 in a row.

Then when the Marines lose, you have to start again.  If the same people aren't willing to play again, you can look forward to packing away and setting it up a different time.  Setting it up takes a while, probably about 15 minutes, and the game itself usually takes 3-4 hours, depending on how far the Marines manage to make it.

The combat system works well for just being dice.  You can gauge how far away to shoot from, how much damage you need to inflict, and how much ammo you're willing to risk.  However, dice swings can really sour a game.  If a Marine keeps losing all of their ammo, the Invader can more easily tear through them and turn the balance even further to one side.  While fun for a while as the Invader, it turns into a tedious pattern of chasing down ammo-less marines that really isn't fun for anyone.  The game is best when it feels tense for both sides, which due to poor gameplay balance doesn't happen as much as it should.

I bought the expansion and I hope that will help though!  Despite my complaints above, I have a lot of fun playing this game.  If we got a solid group of 4 who wanted to play this at least once a month, I'd likely be making a custom campaign to mitigate the problems with the provided campaign.

My friends and I love the simple, straight forward mechanics of this game which allow folks who aren't hardcore boardgamers to have fun and focus more on actually playing the game, rather than figuring out how to play.  First scenario we played was a down-to-last-die-roll game and a concensus fave.

Amazing game, complex. I remember playing Space Hulk back 10-15 years ago and loving it. This game is exactly like that, but cooler. A lot of games expand on the idea of a modular dungeon crawling type game with scenarios and campaigns. This game unfortunately lacks many expansions. I only have the base set. But it's definitely a lot of fun.

This ends up hovering at a sweet Lagrange point halfway between a table-top minis game and an RPG.  

I like the basic game engine, especially in keeping combat to a single dice throw—range, hit and damage all in one tumble.  

It can be a hellish challenge for the Marines, however (a win for them is a difficult stunt to pull off), but as long as everyone knows that from the get-go it can make for a good, albeit tense, time.  (And when they do win, standing high-fives, jocular invectives, and a decent amount of crowing are well in order.)

All in all a fun combat adventure game.

I enjoyed it (2 marines and I was the Invader player). But it's quite long and appears to be very tough for the marines. There is a lot of critical luck with the ammo running out, the Invader card picks and dice rolling in general. An Invader Archvile or Dud ammo can really be critical in certain situations. As can failing to finish off an Invader and letting it live for one more turn etc. This would be fine if the game only lasted an hour or so per scenario but it's much more than that (we stopped after about 3 hours half way through the first one).

Played it more and its not too bad. Surprisingly slow paced.

It's not so much that I'd have to be in the right mood as I'd have to make sure I have enough hours to invest in it. I've only played the game once, but it took 3 players nearly 6 hours to complete this game. I think we added 1 1/2 hours because we played to completion rather than to the amount of deaths we had. I'd much rather play a game that kept me entertained throughout rather than just my turn.

RATING: 10
The production values of DOOM: TBG are truly impressive.  I was so floored by the high quality components that I felt it necessary to paint the eye-bleeding neon sculpts to match the beauty of the rest of the game (a project I won't soon complete, nor attempt again anytime soon).  With a few tweaks to the mechanics, the game can be an unusally engrossing dungeon crawler for all.

Regarding the, what I view as unfair, muckraking on the game, I would say it is definitely hard for the marines but by no means would I resort to throwing around the dirty word - "broken".  The philosophy of the game is to be unblanced toward the invading party (Have you ever played the video game?!).  However, most people mistake this for a lack of playtesting and call it crap and I couldn't disagree more.

Update:  I finally finished painting all the figures and decided to bump this game up to a 10 (as they add a lot to the overall mood and feel).  I figure something should get the credit for all that hard work anyway.  Also, the expansion fixes a lot of the percieved problems with the base game and includes new multiplayer death matches.  What can I say?  I freakin' love this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Much better than originally expected. This game is a very intense dungeon crawl and we always have a great time playing.  The components are nice and the combat system is nicely streamlined.  The game was long (but did not feel long and in fact flew by the times I played).  With more plays I will likely bump up this rating, but I like to be conservative to see how a game holds up over time.  Right now, I'd gladly play again whenever I have the chance.

  One common complaint about the game by others is a lack of ammo.  I think this problem actually stems from the DOOM license itself.  In the video game you routinely mow down everything in sight.  That is not how this game is designed.   Instead, it is an intense game where the marines need to keep moving and  conserve actions/ammo to most efficiently complete the objective.  In my opinion, this makes the game tactically superior to the kill'em all  mentality of the video games.  Ubfortunately, many others do not appreciate this difficulty on the marines and think the game is broken because of it.

Unlike others I prefer the tension in Doom to the ubercharacter building of descent.

A very good game, but I would prefer the game have more to do with kicking ass instead of conserving resources.  Survival horror holds zero appeal to me, but marines mowing down demons does.  This game really needs some house rules to increase the fun factor.  Also, what is up with the invader player having to kill the marines multiple times to win?  It me this just screams bad playstesting: instead of actually balancing the game, just add more "frags" until it evens out.  (edit after expansion)  The extra rules add a lot, and help balance the game.  Much better now!

I´m a huge Doom fan, so it is natural that I like the boardgame version. To be honest, I have played the game only once and it was a long time ago, so I don’t remember all the game nuances, but I just bought it so I will comment more in the near future.

I remember the game comes with a lot of great miniatures (I’m impressed, perhaps the best minis I’ve seen), and that is the main reason why I bought it, I also remember that the overlord has a lot of power, that is, I felt the game is unbalanced in favor of the overlord. The play time was high and the game components were great. 

I will comment more soon, for now I’m rating it a 6.0. An Ok game that I would play from time to time.

A surprise hit with my wife. I wasn't sure she would enjoy either the mechanics or the theme, but she is forever demanding to play it much to my delight.

I enjoy both sides. The invaders are fun but will almost always win so they are sometimes not as satisfying to play. The marines will almost always lose. I don't however believe that to be a bad thing. For some reason I keep seeing demands to balance the sides. That defeats the purpose of the game. It is supposed to be extremely difficult for the Marines. I enjoy the desperate situation that I find myself in as the Marine. It just makes victory that much sweeter!

A fine game but it's a bit lengthy due to the added time needed to set the game up.

You need to download the additional rules from their web-site for adjusting the difficulty. It's a lot of set-up involved to just kill things over and over. Miss Panda hates it so I'll have to unload it.
Update: Gave it away at Cold Wars for $20. All figures primed in 3 colors, big storage box for the figs and 2 compartment boxes for all the counters.

I have seen the appeal of miniatures! This game is so fun and thematic. It makes for great tactical discussions, and the minis add so much to the immersive element. I really like the "reveal the tiles as you go" mechanic, which may add some maintenance time to the game, but it adds an element of surprise to entering a new room that I feel is lacking in games that would otherwise be similar.

In conclusion its a very fun game with an amazing theme and great strategy.

I've only played once so I have to keep my rating moderate.  I like the ambiance of this game much more than Descent.  I cannot speak for the "overlord" or whatever they are called in this game, but as a marine you really feel like your just trying to survive and some situations can become intense.  I also like how Doom adds more monsters, whereas Descent makes the monsters stronger which really does nothing when 4 heroes are playing.  I very much enjoyed my one session.

RATING: 4
Takes a long time and doesn't play well with two players. For three players (two marines) it is still very difficult for the maries. Might need som house rules in order to work properly. Having played the PC game improves the experience, painting the minis are another. One problem in general is that there are few scenarios.

Nowhere near as good as other games covering the same sort of subject matter.  Takes too damn long to play and lacks a certain tension its competition has in spades - I didn't feel like there were many interesting decisions to make.  Players don't have enough to do with their characters and the downtime is considerable.

Ignore the comments stating it's as good or as better as Space Hulk or Siege of the Citadel - it isn't even in the same league.

I had a hard time with this. I struggled between a 6.5 and a 7. It really is broke out of the box but strangely I still like it. I would love to know how any one has ever beaten a scenario with the rules as they are. You have to have had some fantastic luck drawing equipment cards. Way, way to hard for the marines and conversely way, way to easy for the invader player. Still I liked it enough to make up rules for solo play. I need help.

I love the mechanics of this game, but it takes sooo long to play... Playing the Invader is fun, but what I really love about this game, is being part of the marine team! 3 guys moving in, exploring the board, discussing strategies and tactics, sharing weapons and ammo, covering each other, generally working as a team to beat the odds, and then, usually, dying horribly!!! 
That´s fun and intense every time! It´s also very hard for the marines to win, and most times we play, I think the game takes too long, dragging out, as the chances of ever winning move further and further away...

RATING: 8.5
A squad-based wargame based on the popular video game Doom. This game is played between 2 teams: the Invader and the Marines. The basic rules are quite simple to learn and the game plays fairly quickly. I particularly like the combat system which can resolved battles in a single roll, yet is flexible enough to accomodate a slew of different weapons and abilities.

The good: Minis are extremely detailed (even though the 3 colors are a bit garish). The boards are modular and have some nice gory artwork on them. The gameplay really works well, especially the fact that the Invader is an actual player and not a gamemaster. Overall, a highly enjoyable experience.

The bad: Some of the larger minis were poorly molded and are unbalanced, causing them to constantly tip over. The player-aid (while useful) doesn't give the names of any creatures or weapons. IMO, the game would've been improved tremendously by that correcting that oversight. Box has no insert so everything just gets dumped into the box. And finally, the base scenarios do seem unbalanced and require the addition of houserules to make them work.

I generally don't like games where I feel my actions don't have a bearing on the game.  The overlord having perfect information about the actions available to the players I severely dislike.

The Overlord...I mean  the Invader player is easily able to punish the marines pretty hard, I would suggest some deliberate self-regulation. Applying pressure on the marines flexibly instead of wiping them provides a cinematic experience for everyone around the table with good tempo and dramatic peaks throughout the campaign.

The text in the Hungarian edition by DeltaVision is a bit weird in some cases. No big deal here, but the Marine skill cards are the evidence that the translator was not really familiar with military lingo.

A good teenage boy game.  If this was released when I was a teenage boy I would have probably given it a 9.  I am not and there are many other games I would prefer to spend my time playing now, many shorter and some longer.  As I am now this is a 6, possibly even a 5 for me if I play it much more.

There will be plenty of people who will give it 8, 9 or 10 though.

I liked this game a lot.  It had a really fun horror-theme feel that captured the video game well.  Ultimately it was my enjoyment of it that led me to purchase Descent which is currently my favorite game ever.

I liked Descent so much in fact, that I simply stopped playing Doom.  Anytime I felt like it, I would always end up opting for Descent instead, and so in the end I decided I didn't need both and traded it away.

Ugh. I reaaaly wanted to like this game, but it seemed to go out of its way to make it unfun for the marines. 

Only played 4-player. Random ammo loss is stupid. As the marine player, I felt like I was being played by the game instead of the other way around. Everytime we marines came up with a strategy or tactic, it was stymied by the Invader's cards. After a while it seemed pointless to even try. 

The dice are a GREAT mechanic. Bravo there.

Basically a dungeon crawl, but an good game nonetheless.  The combat system, where dice decide everything (range, hit or miss, damage and ammo usage) with a singe roll is elegant and quick.  Fast & fun gameplay, well driven by cards and dice keeps the game moving.  Excellent bits and production values.  Good replayability due opened ended scenario based play.  Look forward to additional FFG scenarios as well as user created scenarios.  Destined to be a classic! (December 2004)

This is Descents cousin.  This game plays almost identicle to descent there are a few differences but this game favors the overlord making it easier for him/her rather than the players.  So it is challenging for the players to win as it probably should in a sci fi horror game.

I still play the video games, so it's a blast to send out these vile creatures after my friends. Prepare a lot of space though. The levels can take up a lot of table top. I usually have the rooms connected in advance for time saving purposes, and then populate them as the marines explore. Some great fan created levels have come out recently on FFG's forum. That and the up coming expansion with new monsters moved this game up to a 10 status from it's previous 9 status.

Very cool game and well done adaptation of the pc game - when looking at the atmosphere. But what made me rate it only 6 and not higher (what the "theme" and "feeling" would have made it for me) : It is hopeless unbalanced - the marine players don´t have ANY chance if playing against a non-idiot-alien-player. Try to compensate this by recommended rules changes like they are written in the expansion... (invader player only draws 2 cards with 3 players - and we use the special rule that weapons provide one extra ammo when they are picked up. So you don´t get into ammo-trouble within the first two rooms...). But normally - when the invader player has some clue about how playing this game the marine players don´t have any chance. The action cards of the invader players are very annoying - you often have the feeling that all of your planning and all your tactics are totally useless because the action cards have such an impact on the game...

I discovered this game by accident, but am glad I did. Like all FFG products, Doom has high-quality components all round. However, the rules are definitely imbalanced. Scenario 2 is infamous for being virtually impossible for the marines to win without using any marine-aid house rules.

I'll always love this game though, because I've spent so much time painting the figures, and even making some of my own. Of course, I've been a long-time Doom fan, so I'm quite biased. But there's something about picking up shotgun ammo and blowing away a Hell Knight that makes this game intense.

Having played Descent over 30 times, I can now see after my first play, where the Descent system originated from.  DOOM is very similar to it's video game namesake and since I like Descent, this wasn't half bad.  It needed several rules tweaks or house/variant rules to balance the game for the Marines.  Otherwise, I simply do not reasonably see how the Marines can win half the time (using only the rules as originally printed).

I enjoy the fun dungeon crawl aspect to the game.  After one play as the invader, I was frequently frustrated by the number of misses by my big guns but I love those spiders...:-)  I could see this game getting a bit repetitive over time although the different scenarios may help relieve that potential problem.

My apologies to King Friday, I totally hosed him in our first game of Doom (and yet he almost won). I don't even know if I can rate this after the one play because we played so many things wrong. I do see the basics of a game I can come to really enjoy though.

I love the RPG like elements of revelation of rooms, and I think the combat dice are well done (if a little too complicated for what they are). The cards are awesome as well (make sure you shuffle your the Doom deck before you play your first game). 

Ultimately I find myself with better small squad skirmish games that just do better things all around. If I only have two players I am going to want to play Space Hulk, if I have more I will want to play Space Crusade. Sorry Doom, you are good, but you just don't measure up to the competition.

Doom is a fun and relatively light "dungeon" exploration game.  The "balance issues" so frequently discussed were not evident in the first game that I played even though we did not employ any of the fixes listed on this site(the marines eventually lost while standing on the threshold of the victory door). The marines lost heavily when I played the scenario again (with me as the Invader this time) and the three players complained of a lack of ammo which they felt gave a serious advantage to the Invader player.

It can be very frustrating, as the game is quite unbalanced... But I guess it depends on the players. As the game master, I've almost never lost a game, and it's the reason why my friends don't want to play it anymore...

It felt somehow simple the first time I played it, but my friends weren't up for a full game the first time so I took it as just a fun game with some of the coolest bits I've seen, but after my second play (1 on 1 on the first scenario), I am ready to say this game lacks of something when you're not playing it "right", the system works OK, but it is somehow in someway flawed. Maybe is my bland narration of the scenario (and my total lack of skill as "DM"), maybe is not the right group. I really want to give it a try once again or in several scenarios, and maybe it will improve in my rating.

RATING: 7
Good game, and a must for people like me who loved the comp. game. Great intuitive gameplay and customable rules that can be fitted to whatever experience the players has. The problem is lack of character development, but hey - it's doom :)

I have heard a lot of people complaining about the diffuculty of the game, but don't take this too seriously. It -should- be hard for the marine, and the experience of being on the brink of destruction and in lack of ammothroughout the game is actually pretty faithfull to the computergame.

Prefer this over descent.

After one 4+ hour play, this game was a lot more fun than I expected, and it had a lot of tough tactical and stategic decisions.  It does take a bit long, though.  Components are excellent, except for the cards, which are fair.  With the Official Mod from FGG, the ammo issue goes away if you want it to.  Certainly worth the $13.00 clearance price I spent on it.  I would say it's worth at least $40 to me.  If I were richer, I'd even pay full retail!

JULY 2006 UPDATE: Found that I just don't have a desire strong-enough to play this again yet, so have adjusted my rating (from 8.25) to 7.5 accordingly.

RATING: 7.5
Dungeon crawl, in the Doom universe. Again, it's GM vs Player. It feels like a Doom game should feel like: nasty and scary. Maybe a little too much so.
A Doom game should be hard, I accept that, but imho there's difference between "hard" and "downright impossible".
If you are the marine player, there's just no chance you will be able to complete the scenario without the GM making blantant mistakes.
Fun to play for the first few times, then, when you realize the real victory chances as a marine, the fun wears off a bit, but it's still worth a try.

RATING: 1
I have only tried this once, and the marines slogged quite miraculously all the way through the level only for it to become clear when confronting the boss that the game was broken. It was so far beyond unbalanced that the idea of it being merely 'unbalanced' would have seemed in fact like some kind of benevolent utopia... the ludicrous reality was that it was effectively *impossible*.

What on earth is the point? A complete waste of time and will never play again. Did anyone playtest this? Even once? In fact, forget playtesting, the problems in this game should have been mind-numbingly obvious from 1000 yards. I'm still wonderstruck thinking about this over a year later.

The streamlined combat system makes this game easy to learn, although working out how to reliably gauge the range and damage of a weapon takes some practice. This game seems way too difficult for the marines (our first game was on the 2nd easiest difficulty setting), and in future, we will play with all of the difficulty-reducing rules in play.

A "fast and furious" dungeon crawl game. Some tactic and a good dose of luck. Unbalanced gameplay (too difficult for the marines, but the new rules about "difficulty levels", on FFG website, may help. Besides, it's more a problem regarding the scenarios than the rules).
Easily customizable.

With a slight tilt of the rules in the Marine's favor, this game turned out to be great fun. I even enjoyed it more than Descent because there was less complexity piled on top of the core rules - moving around and rolling multicolored dice. Plus, there are guns.

Doom: The BoardGame, FFG's awesome start into Dungeon Crawlers. It founds the basis for other good games to follow: 

Descent: Journeys in the Dark, 
Descent: Journeys in the Dark 2. Edt. 
Star Wars: Imperial Assault

In the end I am inclined to say that Doom is actually the best and most thematic version of them all. it delivers a degree of tension and excitment the others simply lack.

RATING: 3
Unbalanced and annoying.  The game comes down to the "logistics" of always trying to have LOS on blind spots or risk the monster pops up and smacks you before you can do anything.  I suppose squad tactics are in order.  Also, the ammunition situation is miserable...I recommend playing with the mods allowing the marines to select play order, an ammunition comes with every gun, and give medic as a third character card.

Ultimately way too long of a game.  Why shouldn't I be putting that time into a really good game or playing several quick smack 'em ups like Knizia's Gladiators or Pirates Cove?

In Doom: The Boardgame, demonic invaders have broken through from another dimension into the Union Aerospace Corporation’s Mars base. Marines have been deployed to the base to protect UAC personnel and destroy the invaders. Up to three players will take the roles of heavily armed and highly trained marines, while one player will control the legion of demonic invaders. In the game, the marine players explore the claustrophobic rooms and corridors of the Mars base, attacking monsters, picking up new weapons and equipment, and working together to complete specific mission objectives.

Balance issues, yes. Sometimes, playing 'the bad guys' you'll find yourself pulling punches to keep the game exciting for the Marines. But the game is a blast to play and has very cool minis. I love dungeon crawlers, and this is a good one. It gives a great sense of exploration.

DOOM. The mere word conjures up a sense of forboding and danger. I think most would agree that the PC games carrying that name have lived up to that image as they have all been well regarded and have contributed greatly to defining the Sci-Fi Horror genre in general. So how well does DOOM: The Boardgame succeed in this task?

Strap yourself securely into your seat there Marine - you are about to find out!

DOOM: The Boardgame is a very different kind of gaming experience. There are the typical things you'd expect to see in a "adventure" type of game  like map tiles, decks of cards, dice and lots of plastic figures, but the game goes way beyond the typical "dungeon crawl" and delivers a really unique and intense experience to the players the game setting - who typically will not survive the game in most cases!

One player takes control of the Invaders and tup to three others control the Marine who work as a team. The Invader player is in a sense a Dungeon or Game Master in the sense that he controls all the creatures the other players must fight, but unlike a Dungeon Master, he is actively trying to defeat the other players too! This simple twist ratchets up the intensity with every turn as the Marine players know that time is limited and they need to haul ass to accomplish the task at hand - usually which is just finding the exit.

I won't go into all the details of the rules and everything, you can find a much more detailed explanation of all that at:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/31385

What I will say is that I simply love this game. It always immerses me into the setting and as I usually play the Invader player, I am usually the one dealing out a lot of death and destruction to the other players. That's not to say I win all the time, on the contrary, it's a pretty even split for the most part.

DOOM is often compared to it's descendant - Descent as the two games share similar mechanics, combat resolution and segmented map tiles, but the two games are very different and those that say otherwise are doing both games a dis-service.

Descent is a great adaption of Dungeons and Dragons yet it can be completed in a single evening. DOOM is a great adaptation of the movie ALIENS put into a game format. You are outnumbered, under-armed and the clock is constantly ticking as you strive to find the exit and... LIVE.

This game doesn't do anything fancy, but it's just darn fun to play.

The tile map pieces are great & flexible (for your own creations). The minis are excellent and gruesome. the combat is fast paced and fun. And the theme just oozes from the moment you open the box to when you pack it all away.

It's true that the marines seem to have a tough go more often than not, but there is so much flexibility with this game you can house rule just about anything. I usually give the marines more health to start with to help out.

Also I love the fact that this is somewhat of a gateway into pencil & paper RPGs with the reading of the scenarios and environments to the marine players.

First dungeon crawl and first CoOp game in my collection. We really liked it. Can't wait to play again. Balance was not an issue. We tryed to make it easier for marines in the beginning, but after the first marine victory everyone wanted to raise the difficulty setting. It was more fun to lose :)

- Great dice system, simple and fast combat. 
- Awesome figures
- Interesting D&D/rpg style narrative scenarios.
- Modular board!!
- Good rules, with strategy and intense moments

Does take a while to play, not because of the rules but due to the "setting up' hidden rooms etc. Depends on how fast the players run through the maps, but can feel abit stop-and-start with the room exploring.

It's hard to want to win as the DM, since the players can not progress unless they beat each level

This game caught my interest because I was pleasantly surprised with the gameplay of Descent.

RATING: 7
Very thematic with great bits. The rules are well presented and easy to understand and teach. It seems heavily tilted in favor of the invaders, however I also see ways for the marines to improve their chances. I'm guessing that with practice (and the expansion), this will become quite a fun little romp. The key for the marines seems to be to keep moving at all times and not get hemmed in (confirmed on additional plays.) If a crucial corridor gets jammed with baddies, it's likely game over.

A few aspects of it are a bit tedious, in particular setting up the areas. But this also makes it feel a bit like an RPG, and that's a good thing, I think.

I really like the dice combat system, with all the information on the dice themselves. The monster minis look good (although mine had significant curvature on some of the large bases that made it hard for them to stand up.)

A good, solid effort, I think, and a welcome entry in the "alone against the horde of monsters" genre.

Ordered in the FFG Thanksgiving sale.

Super fun. Easy to understand rules and exciting gameplay. The survival element feels more akin to that of video game "Alien Swarm" then of Doom, but this is by no means a bad thing.

Liked this much more than I expected.  Straightforward mayhem game, but I really liked the abilities of the characters: gives it that extra something over Space Hulk, for example.

Have played 3 player (2 Marines) only.

Fantastic bits and production quality. Interesting system with almost infinite replayability. The inclusion of range, damage and ammo system on the same dice is very well done.

Not perfectly balanced, but it works OK if the Invader player makes it hard, but not too hard, for the Marines.

Ultimately, doesn't 'do it for me', and too long for my liking.

Cons: well, you'll enjoy winning if you are the DM. Otherwise, prepare for an exercise in frustration. The players don't stand a chance in hell even when the DM isn't drawing any cards; add the ability to respawn and affect stuff, and it's not even in the ballpark. 
Pros: Well, I thought I had found a cooperative game that I finally liked. I really enjoyed the tactics and it almost felt like I was part of a crack team of marine. Cool. The game also does have a bunch of tension in it; in that sense the board game replicates the video game very well.

A throwback to the days of Space Hulk and Advanced Space Crusade, this is a quality shoot 'em up. Perhaps a bit slow moving, but definitely a really enjoyable game, playing the invader is great as you get to up the tension with your cards - the marines become more wary once they realise the power of the deck! This part of the game is similar to Last Night on Earth in that regard, but I prefer the implementation in Doom, it is not quite so over-powering.

One of the miniatures stabbed me. :-[ Preliminary assessment after one play is that overall it is better than AGoT or WotR--especially the rules and ease of play. I doubt that the 60-90 minute playing time will be reasonable at all. Nice quality miniatures--looking foward to painting them!

Second play, improved game-play. Marines still got trounced, though.

Just as fun as Descent in my book. We played with the house rule that marines start with extra armor, and I tried to take my actions as quickly as possible to simulate the pressure of the video game. I would definitely like to play this again.

One memorable game involved three marines against the invader in which the marines lost the game in the second room. We decided to carry on and see how long until the marines could finish the level and, after 6 hours, we eventually gave up.

Good tactical fun, but do believe the hype; this game is fiendishly difficult for the marines.

The best tactic seems to be to just run as fast as possible for the exit and only stop to shoot things if they are in your way.

From the time I first saw pictures of this game I were thinking "Maybe after all Warhammer FB & 40K projects". Well, I bought it few weeks ago with christmas money. There were the usual magic when I opened box, all the miniatures and cardboard tiles. The gaming system is very good, but weapons have too low fire range (in realistic), i would like if there could be marine squads (like in SH&SC), but this solo hero gaming works too (still, scenarios are hard). This game will become handy in other games too, like space hulk and my own made systems.

A good ameritrash slugfest and it does well to convert a good computer game into a fun boardgame. Nice minis and components, too. I think I prefer Descent slightly more because it has the fatigue mechanic, but they are both good games. I think Doom will suffer downtime overload with more than four players (ie 3 marines). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good enough game, simply undone by the fact that its concepts have been more "fleshed out" since by Decent.

Update: This came full circle now that there is a real desire for a simple, streamlined sci-fi dungeon crawl, which this is.

RATING: 9
Doom looks like a dungeon crawl but plays completely different. This PC conversion offers thrill a minute stuff where the marines take on the GM who controls the many hideous beasts that have infiltrated the UAC Base.

What makes Doom work is that the Marines cannot survive if they try to kill every alien they encounter and collect every power-up or weapon. Their only chance is to kill what they can and keep a good pace throughout the scenario. 

For this reason Doom offers tense, nail biting action and at between 2-3 hours per scenario the time is spot on. In my opinion this game is underrated.

Great fun, great theme, great components! A bit too lethal for the poor marines, but this just means you get to be delisciously nasty when playing the invader!  In our group, this just meant the marine players kept shouting "Again!" each time they got slaughtered!  One gripe, it just simply seems not winnable for the marines in a 4 player game, and seems too easy in a 2 player game...  But as long as I'm the Invader in the 4player game and the marine in the 2player game, that's fine ;-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very good game, but you have to play with the expansion rule to balance it. Don't expect a new Space Hulk though: Doom was an action video game and this is a pure action/massacre board game. Speeding thru the map killing tons of monster (or die trying) never was so much fun! Descent is better, but Doom has more frags :D

This is a RPG, it even has a GM!, I like this game, it is really fun (tough I have never, nor will I ever, win against my friend who was the GM). The things that I don't like in this game is that the players are really underpowered, but this makes for a more realistic game and a truly challenge for the players, for it will make you fear opening a door (just like the PC Game).

After our first game of Doom, my wife was going through the marine deck: "Oh, look! A sniper! I want this the next time we play. Hold on, this one is even better! No, wait, listen to this..."

How can I not love this game? It has everything our dear old Space Crusade has, and a bucketful of other stuff besides. Variety, tension, atmosphere, hordes of huge nasty monsters, and – most importantly – enough surprises to keep me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.

For me, Doom is "happy gaming" at its simplest. It will never reproduce the sheer nirvana of a well-planned transportation network in Age of Steam or the delights of diplomatic tit-for-tat in Wallenstein, but that's not what it's for. Doom is like that big, not-too-bright guy you know with an endless supply of beer and firecrackers... and an endearing, mischievous grin.

Average. I had a great time playing the game (which is very poor without the expansion) for the first two hours,  it took a litte bit long because was my first game (also Invader's Side player first game too). The mechanics are just fine. Simple. This game is so repetitive... 

2007-02-10: Three player game takes too long to complete. More than 5 hours... doing the same thing over and over. From 6 to 5.

This is one of the greatest new board games out there right now. A lot like Space Hulk and Mutant Chronicles. Worth every penny! Victory conditions can be extremely hard, but thats the essence of Doom. Just like Space Hulk, sometimes it can be a gauntlet of mayhem to have even a chance at winning.

One player plays the invaders, and the other players play marines attempting to achieve their objective before getting killed. Marines can be returned to life after being killed, but the invader wins with a number of kills. Move, attack, resolve with dice. Invader plays special cards to spawn more creatures or create special events. A fun, engaging experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Own and possibly for Trade. Getting Gears of War which may fulfill similar role in a more pleasing way. Granted I do LOVE this game, I just can't see playing a lot of both if I love Gears of War too and they're similar enough.

Like BSG, Descent, etc. This game doesn't provide a natural incentive to move swiftly and yet, I've discovered that it's MUCH MUCH more fun when it's played quickly since it is an action--real time game simulation after all. I strongly recommend a system using timers where every player has a 1-3 minute timer which doesn't limit their entire turn but how long to take major decisions (they can still execute decisions after timer) this really speeds things up and makes things feel fun, exciting, and tense rather than just stressful, daunting, or overly drawn out. You can impose different reward/punishment incentives with health and ammo in subtle ways from the beginning so that there's incentive to move quickly but your not horribly punished if you occasionally go over.

This game, Battlestar Galactica, and Descent would all get .5 to 1 score higher with me if you use clever streamlined mechanics so that a timer for each turn is actually part of the game and at least one person knows the rules so well that he doesn't have to check rulebook ever and other people know the rules at least fairly well on top of that.

UPDATEUPDATE: The game has good mechanics and is fun to play but it's so clunky to set it up. For the amount of set up take down and rule checking, I'd rather play Descent first edition and now that second edition is out, Doom falls even more. Likewise with other options like DnD adventure games, and Claustrophobia, Doom is just not seeing playtime. It's a good game and one I enjoy playing, but it's not worth the 3-5 hours it takes when it's stacked up against competitors. I'm very sorry to get rid of Doom and the components are amazing, but it should just be faster paced for a guns blazing style game and it's not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good Game.  Only a couple plays under my belt.  Strategy is not as prevalent as in many other games but it is there.  Fun factor is definately there if you like blowing the crap out of things.  Movement and combat is essentially a boiled down d20 system--so if you don't have time for dnd combat the you can spend some time with this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I find I like this much more than Descent because of the quicker gameplay and that the players are less likely to become overpowered in the end-game.

Plus that one time our group ran into a room, two died, I respawned and picked up the BFG which I used to kill 6-7 monsters, grabbed the last key, escaped and won with no spawns left over. Awesome.

Condition of this one isn't super great, it looks like it was a store loner copy/check out copy (got it in an auction).  All the bits are there, but there is heavy shelf wear/a corner split, and the tiles are worn on the puzzle piece connector ends.  That being said, I wouldn't mind trading for something far less in value, due to its condition.  If you're dying to get the game, make me an offer and see what happens!

Basically a weeknight version of Descent. It plays fast and brutal, with the Marines very hard-pressed to make it through the level before being utterly owned. Much like BSG, the longer it takes the more bad stuff is likely to happen, so plan carefully and move quickly. Much like Descent, it's got a cool dice mechanic that speeds up gameplay tremendously over full RPGs with similar systems.

First impression: I'm not that big fan of this type of a games but I like the cooperative element against one player. If on the right mood this type of a games can be quite fun.

This is a seriously fun game.  The Marine must keep moving and choose between standing and fighting, or running like a track star to get to an item/objective.  The invader plays cards, lots of cards, to spawn hordes of invaders to nickle and dime the marine in a "death from a thousand cuts" manner.  Re-playable and dynamic, each game will turn out differently.  Just choosing a different color for the Marine player changes the scenario.  The one flaw - stickers on the dice.  For a game with such high production values, this is a big oversight.  Yuck!  Anyway, hugely entertaining, and dice rolling, monster killing, gore splattering fun.

While I started out enjoying this game, it ran longer than I like.  Most of that was my problem, since I was maneuvering two marines!  I ran out of steam about halfway through the game (took a dinner break) and came back to complete the mission (with some coaching from my husband---the evil invader Lord!) Yeah, I lost (wimpy Marines!) 

I would try this game again (maybe) if there were other marines to further boost my morale. 

I didn't love it for the length of play, but might be willing to play again...just not on my own against such evil.

Entertaining dungeon crawler. Hack and slay, moderately demanding, (semi-)cooperative, and exciting. It can create a serious feeling of horror, but works as trashy fun game as well. Balance is an issue, and tactical options seem a little limited. IMHO more enjoyable than Descent (shot guns are just cooler than swords!).

NECESSARY TWEAKS: Balance strongly depends on the number of players. With 2 (= 1 marine), reduces the tokens on the board. With 4, add tokens; monster cards are removed from the game after having been played. More useful sugestions can be found in the expansion rules, which are applicable without the respective components.

Effectively the same as Descent, but simpler and shorter, making it the preferred option. It has the same problem as all these elongated monster crawls is that each turn is much like the other, and it repeats for a long time. The baddie puts out monsters. You spend your turns deciding whether to move/move or move/attack, or just move or attack but get a stance that you can use on the baddie's turn (pre-emptive attack, re-rolls, etc). There's some tactical decisions to make on where to end your turn so as to limit the places that where the baddie can spawn more monsters (must be out of LOS), and you need to know your dice - some will get you range, others will get you hit points. After that, it's managing the minutae of different monsters have different attack powers, hitpoints and movement points, and managing the tactical situation accordingly. It's reasonably entertaining but not engrossing, and others now do it better in a shorter timespan.

Hella-fun dungeon crawl type game

3/2011-minis all painted up now-cant wait to play again

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
Played it a bunch of times now.  The graphics and figures are very good, the rules are mostly tight and overall this is a highly professional and fun game.  However the scenario limitations and game length will drag it down and limit replayability.  Once you've crawled through the basic 5 scenarios and have wasted a couple 1000 invaders I'm not sure how well the game holds up from there.  It would be better with more scenarios, shorter scenarios, scenarios that don't require an invader player to have secret knowledge (and thus would be replayable).

Based on one play: A fairly close resemblance to the video game, this is a basic dungeon crawler, but definitely not an easy one. The game mechanics are easy, but the levels are tough, even with great rolls we barely made it out of the first dungeon. The game is a little long and repetitive at time, worth a try, but I doubt I would play again.

RATING: 6
This game is very, very similar to Descent, which was based on the Doom mechanics.  Unlike Descent, which is generally skewed toward the players, this game is very skewed toward the Overlord.  I played with a number of variants that attempted to rebalance it some, but still felt the game was skewed.  Ammo shortages were a constant problem for the good guys (and I was playing a variant that gave you more), and running out of ammo just isn't fun.  Spiders that could constantly attack you and then run away was also a big problem for the adventurers--it seemed unfair.  Like Descent, the scenarios last too long.  Overall, I'd say this is Decent with more balance issues.

A little wargame dicefest (like Memoir '44) but with a slightly better theme (atleast to me!).  Enjoyable.  Still a little too long (2hr-ish) for a game that involves a ton of dice rolls.  Update - Better than Heroscape.  The dice rolls are less of a drawback than a normal dice game since they don't vary as much.  The way the weapons/dice work is by far the best element of the game to me.

RATING: 7
It's like a dungeon crawl, only merciless! Smart decisions and good cooperation necessary to win if you're the marines. Moving guys toward the marines necessary to win if you're the invaders. Wish there was more strategy to playing the invader side, and only one campaign and no included difficulty modifier hurt this one.

Closet game

RATING: 9
I played this for the first time as an invader (with 2 marines) and everyone had a blast!  The game was very close, and although I ended up winning, the marines were a couple die rolls away from victory.  The house rules we used were the 'fully loaded' mod (guns come with ammo) and I allowed the marines to pick their ability cards from a central pool, and distribute them as they saw fit.  One player ended up as a super chainsaw tank warrior (medic, special ops, scout) and the other ended up as the long range fire support dude (marksman, sniper, officer).

One of the things we liked about the game was how well it mimicked the computer game.  In particular the invader cards had a lot of interesting effects (like slamming a door closed behind a marine, or causing monsters to attack if an item is picked up) that really reminded me of the computer game.

I'll probably comment more on the game once we get a chance to play it again.

RATING: 6
A nifty sci-fi dungeon crawler, it has some interesting mechanics. However, it's quite slow, and with all the random screwage, I'd rather just go play DoomRL instead for a similar experience. I'm not sure this gameplay works all that well when a level takes 6 hours instead of 6 minutes. Also, the game seems like a reskinned, worse version of Descent (which I've yet to play) - so it's kind of redundant, I suppose?

(based on one 7-hour session with 2 marines)

RATING: 6
It's hard! (Played with 2 players + "Game master"). The game itself is well done and quite fast, but even some kind of reward for killing could have been nice.
I think that fantasy setting with this kind of gameplay is a lot better than this scifi-thing that Doom has. 
At least the atmosphere makes the players anxious!

Great [b]dungeoncrawler[/b] that has a good and [i]thick[/i] theme.

I prefer [b]Descent: Journeys in the Dark[/b] over this one, but that's mostly because of the [i]theme[/i] and the fact that the dungeonmaster has [i]more[/i] to do in Descent. That, [i]of course[/i], doesn't make this a bad game in any aspect. If this theme fits you [i]better[/i] then go with this one. And yes, this one is a bit [i]faster[/i] than Descent.

RATING: 7.25
In short, I like this game.

In long, Doom: The Boardgame is a great adaptation to the old-school PC Doom game (which I played, made maps for, was completely engrossed in, etc when I was a lot younger) where 1-3 marines try to survive an onslaught of monsters, traps, and dangers brought on by the 'Invader' - the [i]other[/i] player option in the game.

The mechanics are quite similar to Descent, whereby the modular board is put together by the invader player, characters battle 'spawned' demons and the like, proprietary dice determine hits, and cards play a major component for the invader player.  The game plays in about 2-3 hours, depending on how familiar you are with the system, and how difficult the scenario is.  I've mostly played 2 player games (invader vs. 1 marine) and it has seemed quite simple for the marine in that situation. 

There is a balance issue with the sliding scale of difficulty based on the number of players involved.  For instance, all scenarios have the same layouts but the number of monsters that will be 'standard' with the scenario will be increased 100% for every active marine player.  

Adding to the increased difficulty, with a full capacity of marines playing the game, each will have less special abilities at their disposal.  Special abilities are represented by cards, which are drawn at random at the beginning of the game.  These abilities are absolutely crucial for aiding the marine in his/her goal.  There are many available, such as: healing, extra movement, extra damage, more range, so on and so forth.  However, with one marine in play s/he receives 3 of these, but with three marines in play, each receives 2.

To add to the increased challenge, or rather to NOT add, there is no extra equipment that appears in the scenario to help the marines and counteract these extra challenges.

As more players take part, marines will NEED to play and work together, making sure they cover all lines of sight to hinder the invader as much as possible.

This is not a game for the feint-hearted. No matter what the score, the marine player is constantly being challenged by the invader in all manner of ways - not just from spawning.  Therefore, the marine player will have to be able to 'suck it up', and blast on through.  Because of this, there can be some great tension on the game, where the marine player is constantly blowing away monsters, taking big risks, and cutting tension with a chainsaw.

With 3 plays recorded, but countless hours spent in playing, I'd be happy, currently, to rate this game at a 9.  Main reason being that I would really enjoy playing this game with more players.  2-player games are good, but I am certain the game shines with 3 or 4.. (likely 3).

RATING: 6
A very strong semi-cooperative game (one player plays the bad guys).  I think there is a lot of potential here, especially with the ability to create new maps each time you play.  The game runs longer than the box indicates (isn't that just Fantasy Flight's M.O.?), but I think the same rule could apply to this game that works in Star Wars:  Epic Duels:  play the game like it's happening real-time.  The game rules are much simpler than I anticipated, a welcome discovery.  It is important for players to work together, as teamwork is typically rewarded.  The only drawback I see is the playing time; if you could get players to adhere to a certain time schedule, this is a great "dungeon crawl" style game that will appeal to many potential gamers.

I love the theme, board, and dice mechanics.  No, the scenarios are not balanced, however, there are mods on the web site and in the downloadable expansion rules that make this a fairly balanced game.  I would recommend this game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The core system is very solid. The 'fun' in the game will depend on the senario played (including all of the new mods). I have enjoyed most of the games we have played but I do not care much for dungeon crawls as a game format. Of the different dungeon crawls available, this is one of the best. The expansion is a must. It adds deathmatch and capture the flag rules plus mods and extra pieces.

Update: since the release of Doom there have been other games that handle the system much better. I personally would play Gears of War or Claustrophobia before playing Doom again. It broke new ground with its release but these later games have improved the system.

RATING: 7.5
Awesome game.This game is really fun but is pretty much a watered-down version of Descent mixed with Mutant Chronicles. A definite buy for any fan of the PC game series lookin for some good action-packed fun in a board game. If not.. pick up Descent instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In terms of dungeon crawlers, this game predates Descent, and has a very similar feel. However, Descent seems bloated compared to Doom. In Doom, setup is quick, the rules are relatively simple and the game plays smoothly without having to look up a lot of extra rules or game terms. It really shines as a fun, but difficult monster-masher game, and the retro video game theme is really fun.  Level 7 Omega Protocol shares a similar theme, and does many of the same things, so if I were to recommend picking up a single marines vs monsters dungeon crawl game, it would be that, but this does come in a close second, assuming you have access to both the base game and the expansion for doom.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:nostar: Clever or interesting mechanisms
:star: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players

Annoying Finnish editions....

The game that got me into boardgaming (thanks Sami!) and we have played this game furiously.

Sadly, this game stopped seeing action after the dice got bad. The first printing had those bad dice that would have their faces rubbed off as they are used. Now they are unusable.

Will need to create some alternate method to determine die results. A chart would work but I would need color coded dice to make it easier.
Or I could move on to Descent as it uses updated mechanics.

That, or I could just leave it be, as semi-coop isn't the most popular type of game in our group...

RATING: 7
this game is pretty much a fun and light dungeon crawl. if you're expecting anything else, you will probably be disapointed. as a fan of rpg's i really enjoy this game. it is pretty fun, especially with an experienced group of gamers who don't mind the hack and slash aspect of this game. 

update: the official mods go a long way to making the game more forgiving. but really, i think that the random ammo loss is the only major game issue. sometimes the dice can be too cruel. (here's some  tips though: your fists are pretty decent weapons, the chainsaw is awesome,  don't forget that you can always just run.)

another note: i'm really sick of hearing how imbalanced the scenerios are. i think that this point has been overstated. the main problem is that this game is unforgiving. i think there is a tendency in the euro-gamer community to play a game once or twice, then move on. what this means is that most players will sit down to play this game once or twice, get hosed because they made a few tactical errors, because they are inexperienced with the game system, then declare that the scenarios are imbalanced and must have never been play-tested. first i have to say that i've played this with dnd rules-lawyers and they've waltzed through this game with no problems, because they have lots of experience with tactical miniature games--one of the players spent his downtime calculating the to hit odds with the various weapons. second, after spending close to forty dollars on a game, why would i want to be able to grok the system on my first or second play? seriously, can somebody explain the reasoning behind this desire? 

in comparison, 18xx games are long and unforgiving, but i've never heard anybody say that any of the various 18xx games are unbalanced or lacked playtesting.  

i can understand the complaints about the length the scenarios take to complete. i can't argue against this point, simply because a person's time is their own to use as they see fit. and i realize that this game may not be a perfect fit in that regard, for many people. however, it is a large leap in logic to conclude that the game's length is a byproduct of a lack of play-testing. the real truth probably  lies closer to the fact that this game is not intended for an audience with a dearth of free time. when i was an undergrad in college, i would spend 12-13 hours straight playing dnd, once a week. comparably, doom is a short game, clocking in at about 1/4 that time, if that. if i had access to this game as an undergrad,  this game would have seen some serious mileage. now, with more constraints upon my time, doom obviously doesn't get to see a lot of table time, but this dosn't mean i can logically conclude that this game hasn't been play-tested. the game works as far as i can tell.

Similar to Space Hulk obviously and shares the same weird thing has that. Surviving is just damn hard! I'd love to see this game played so that the marines actually win. Most of the time, we were just punching the monsters since all the ammo ran out ages ago and because of that, it didn't really have the doom feeling where you're running along guns blazing. Eventually, we were just bogged down in a corridor full of 2x2 monsters etc.

Loved the first game! Marines did surprisingly well for taking a "clear the room of everything" strategy (ultimately they lost). I played Overlord and punished them for this accordingly. About midway through they started to see the error of their ways and reverted to a more streamlined and focused strike force.

Look forward to playing this again, and the marine players have asked for a chance at redemption.

I feel like this game gets a bad rap from some people.Yes, it's hard for the marines to win, but I feel like it's hectic play accurately emulates the video game, with a strong run-and-gun mentality and just enough strategy to keep things interesting. It definitely has its flaws, but it's a game I've pulled out a few times with friends, and it's always interesting.

All in a big heavy  squared box!
If you like Space Hulk and liked Doom 3, do yourself a favor: get it.

Nice twist on dice rolling combat, combined with clever mechanics, excellent bits and great theme. But the various elements somehow don't come together to make as fun of a game as you'd think. Part of the issue is just the general fiddlyness of it. The game comes to a standstill as the board is built out mid-game. The marines struggle for progress and are often simply bogged down. It sometimes feels less like a struggle to survive than a tedious dice rolling exercise.

Adding in the official mods, and a few house rules and this game starts to shine. Even with building out the map beforehand, the game is still way too long, though. I'd give the tweaked game with mods, some elements from the expansion and some house rules a 7.

08-06-2014. Rated after 2 plays. I liked Doom the Boardgame a lot. But I like Descent's fantasy theme (reimplements Doom) better so that's why Doom's out. I would probably suggest checking out Level7: Omega Protocol nowadays, before recommending Doom. It's a bit dated/showing its age.

Just what I expect from this game. Tons of fragging with a bit of strategy involved. Light hearted game that doesn't take itself seriously one bit. I really felt like I was playing the PC game and I loved it.

Only problem is there are just soooo many components to the game that set up takes a while sometimes. That aside, the game is amazing for just having friends over with some beers for a good time.

--1Jan2005-- Played this with a friend and a couple nephews.  Reminded me a lot of the video game:  the same feeling of general hopelessness as the collection of monsters multiplied around us, leading to our inevitable destruction.  If that works for you - great; you might like this.  I'll give it a miss next time, if I can help it.  It's not "boring", but (right now) I'm not motivated to play.  It feels like a 4 or 5.  Unfortunately, Son #1 wants to play at next month's game day.  Help!
--Oct2005-- Well, I'd survived until now without a replay.  It's not too bad once one knows all the rules and has played with the mechanics a bit.  There's definitely not enough ammo for 3 marines, though.
--Nov2005-- Amusing; I actually enjoy it 1-1.  Not convinced it would hold up to a lot of replays, but it's definitely amusing.

First impressions: This may be the tactical minis game for me. There's a great ominous feel to the gameplay, where something bad definitely always is around the corner. It's tough and in turn tense, though perhaps not quite so tense when the marines incorporate respawning into their strategy. Then again, you can't lean on that a lot. Respawning is really the only thing so far that I find gamey, but I don't mind it really. It can't be imagined into the story easily (edit: well, more or less), but it's honestly the only thing I had to turn a blind eye to. Great fun!

After playing Earth Reborn and Forlorn: Hope, two prime challengers to Doom in my book, I've decided to pursue Doom. You can see more of why in my comments for both of those games, but suffice to say here that Doom stands squarely between the best of both of those titles. It's as simple as F:H but has the visual appeal and random scenario generation of ER. It's longer than F:H but forces a lot less action point counting than ER, the adding up of numbers being a necessity instead of a thrill.

Now that I've played Doom a few times as well, I can say my impressions stand. This game is fun with minimal fuss albeit fiddly at times.

RATING: 6
If you methodically and therefore *slowly* try to kill off every monster with the better weapons, you'll run out of ammo -- especially since you'll be giving the Invader plenty of cards to make your progress even slower. Players who play aggressively -- like use the chainsaw -- will move faster and thus pick up the powerups before the Invader can regroup.

***

Doom is tough on a solo player, but it has craploads of tactics. The marine player starts with different powers, which, if he's smart, will affect how he attacks the monsters and stuff. Likewise, he'll have different weapons to choose from, so will engage in risk management. Finally, the maps are infinitely tweakable and, heck, you can make your own map and make your own d*mn balance. 

***

I found Doom to be more "visceral" than Descent. The Invader is a threat (no pun intended) more than an opponent.

I find Doom actually moves *faster*. Since ammo *is* a problem, you have to rely more on running faster to the next piece of ammo, or relying up on the chainsaw. The marine cards, in my gameplay experience, force the marine players to adapt to the cards and generate their own tactics. 

Despite using the same core mechanic, the games differ enough that you have two different styles. Descent is heroic, while Doom is horror. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A one-versus-many game, based on the popular first person shooter [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_3]Doom[/url].

One player takes control of the hordes of hell (zombies, demons and mutants) as the Invader against 1 to 3 Marine players who try to make it out of the Mars base alive. 
The game is played over multiple scenario's, with a different map lay-out and objectives that is being built-up as the Marine player(s) scout the corridors.

The boardgame emulates the dense, desperate athmosphere of the videogame really well. It does keep the Marine players on their toes, as nasty surprises wait around every corner. The way enemies spawn, pushes the Marine player(s) to tactics much akin to the ones you use to survive in the video game, without feeling like this game railroads them, or robs them of the opportunity to make interesting tactical decisions.

When adding more Marine players, the difficulty level starts to swing in favour of the Invader player, as he gets granted relatively more resources than the good guys do. FFG released a downloadable [url=https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Doom/doommod1.pdf]difficulty level[/url] adjustment to remedy this. Players should try this out to see which difficulty level fits their comfort zone.

[b][u]Painted the miniatures?:[/u][/b] Not yet, and though it may take quite some time before I do paint them, I certainly plan on doing so at a future point in time.

Played it to the end only once. I really like the shooting mechanics. I don't like that the invader turn generally takes longer than the other turns.

(13 sept 2017) It never got played. I am discouraged of playing it because of setup- and play time. So I sold it. When I opened the box for the first time in years I noticed that the large groundpiece was a bit warped, and some of the plastic figures would not stand anymore. The pieces could be fixed with manual bending.

RATING: 7
Quite good but quite long too. Not enough ammo. Too many duds. Not enough ammo. Loads of great components. Not enough ammo. Very hard with just one man against the horde! Not enough ammo. Too much chainsaw. Not enough ammo. <BR><BR> Perhaps the ammo problem could be fixed by having the creatures drop some when you kill them - just like the 'real' thing. This could be as a result of an ammo symbol rolled on a die rolled after the creature is killed or something?

Quite enjoyable tactical game that I wish I could get to the table more. It strikes me it may have limited re-playability, but the enhanced role of the normally reactive 'evil' player is good, and makes even the same map different. Plus, it's doom - it gets points there.

Generally, I think Descent (1st Ed) is better than this - but this isn't bad.

RATING: 6.5
Visual Appeal: (3)
This is on par with Descent and other dungeon crawl type games. I tend to think these games look a bit messy on the table, and prefer more compact games. The art style is after id Software's DOOM 3 video game. The monsters are all neon colors, and I wish I had the skill to paint them :(

Components: (4)
There are a LOT of pieces to this game. tokens, cards, maps, doors, monsters and players. For the most part they are very nice quality. I do not, however like the box. There's no hint as to how it should be best organized in there and it can be quite messy.

Theme: (4)
This game has maps that reveal as you move. There's a lot of room for the DM to be creative with both the pre-made scenarios and custom ones. All of the weapons, monsters, and player actions fit perfectly within the genre and theme of the game making it a potentially enthralling few hours of game play.

Learning: (3)
I think these games are inherently hard to teach and learn because of all of the different scenarios that could occur. This was my first dungeon crawl style game, so I was starting from no experience. The first game was very slow as all of the players had to check and recheck the rules and turn sequence.

Gameplay: (3)
Most of the exciting stuff happens between the DM and the players, and some of it can be quite mean. There's a bit of flexibility for the DM to create a story driven challenge or just stomp face. I prefer the former.

Overall Fun: (3)
It starts off as a fun experience that just takes too long for me. Getting into the theme and adding a little RP flavor makes this game work best for me, but I just can't justify playing this in lieu of one of my favorite games 2-3 times in that same span.

Get the lights right, put on Quake or Judgement Night soundtrack, and bring some boomstick death to the alien invaders from hell! I was going to quickly do 2 rooms of the first scenario to get the rules of the game. I had so much fun I ended up playing through the whole thing, and I HATE playing solitaire! I was shouting out "Yeah! You like that?!" as I shotgunned two zombies to death with one shot, "Fire in the hole!" as I chucked a grenade at two demons, and "Yeah boyeeeeeeee!!!" as I got swamped by trites and chainsawed them all to death with one swoop. I came at this game as an ex-Space Hulk player and this game is far superior in quality, gameplay, and straight out fun. Just played with a full group and I had fun, even if I did have to be the invader :(. I want to play Killer Kane the marine! "I cut off his head with the wire...and he KEPT ON TALKING...AAARRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!!". UPDATE: Fear the THING THAT SHALL NOT DIE! Do not loot the dead, they will have their revenge!

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20055]The expansion[/url] has redeemed this game in terms of balance and playability with minor changes like introducing different dificulty levels, so each group may pick the one that fits better to the players; adding some adjustments in the Marines' setup, especially those described as mods of play, and changing the number of cards allowed to be drawn by the Alien, letting him/her pick only two cards per turn and giving that way a few extra time to the Marines to fulfill their objectives without being penalized with points against them.  With those modifications the game really shines.  Speaking of other things, it captures extremely well the atmosfear and feelings of the video game.

Well, what a greatly themed dungeon crawl game. I love being the invader player (actually, never been a marine).

I love FFG, but they're so stinkin' expensive.

2 plays so far a solo practice and a game with 3 marines. I like it. Yes it's tough for the marines. I think once one is familiar with the scenarios, the marines can work together well enough to do well. Can they still survive the campaign...that I'm not sure about yet, but I expect they would need to be real lucky. First game was 3 hrs with teaching the rules (15 min.) So game is longish by Euro standards, but a rollicking good time.

Update: After a few more plays my initial reaction to the game has been subdued by huge imbalance problems (even using the "rebalancing" recommendations from FF) Out of 5 games with, by now, experienced marine players they have yet to beat the invader. The gameplay is good, the dice mechanism is great, but there is little want to play a game that you can't win unless you really pervert the marines abilities. (Traded Away)

With expansion. This was before they announced a new one. It did some cool things.

:) Easy to understand mechanics, good gateway
:) Good amount of story fluff while keeping the action moving
:) Mini quality is fantastic
:) Creating the map is so much easier than something like imperial assault, a fraction of the time.
:):) Map doesn't get prebuilt before the game, so great tension on marine players as they don't know whats around each corner

:soblue: Demon player minions die so quick, you never feel like they matter
:soblue: Super expensive expansion
:soblue: Player reference sheets too big

It's better than the PC game it is licensed from. Just as much atmosphere with the figures and far more strategy, played to the strengths and weaknesses of each type of weapon and monster. 

Being a recognizable name, players enter the game with an inkling of how it plays  out, which hastens the learning of the many little rules that often go with figure-movement games.

I expect Kevin Wilson's "Mod" packs to boost the play possibility very high, and someday, I anticipate seeing an "Invader-less Rules" version of the game with 2 or 3 players actively building the map and placing monsters along the way.

2014: 6. Just can't get this to the table to play.  Have other games in my collection that I'd rather be playing.  Nothing really wrong with Doom, I enjoyed my time with it, but ready to move on.

I didn't exactly like the Doom3 PC game but the boardgame called out to me with it's Space Hulk-like gameplay and plastic bit glory! Man, it's one heavy box.

It's a die fest and a frag fest. A typical dungeon crawl with programmed instructions and a gamemaster. The design of the game is well thought out (range on dice, damage, spawning, etc).

Critics slam it for being too hard on the marines. That's very true but there are lots of variants to make it 'easier'. Besides, who wants to play a game that's too easy to win anyway?

It's heavy but still fun to play. A little on the long side too.

Finally I have a chance to get back to this "rate without playing issue".
First of all I'd like to say that I'm sorry to have "spoken out of turn", it was my very first comment and I didn't really understand the importance of ratings. I have no idea how to delete that post, but consider it deleted!
Having said that, I still think that the game 'looks' a lot like SpaceHulk, which is not bad on the whole, BUT I really hope there is something new as well besides the great looking miniatures! In fact I had "rated" with a 5 not a 1! I'm looking forward to it, since I didn't like the pc version of Doom III, and I was a big fan of the series.
Now I hope I've made my point clear.
Sorry for the misunderstanding, and I dearly hope this time I didn't screw up again!
Cheers to all ^_^

Szörnygyilkolás táblán. Egy nagyon jól megvalósított számítógépes adaptációról van szó. Egy játékos vezeti a szörnyeket, a többiek egy csapatot alkotva a tengerészgyalogosokat, akiknek különböző céljaik lehetnek, legtöbbször persze élve elhagyni az egyes űrbázisokat. A tengerészgyalogosok két-három különleges képességgel rendelkeznek és a kalandjaik során a játékból ismert fegyverekhez juthatnak. Jól kidolgozott játékmenet, jól kitalált szörnyirányítás. Egyetlen negatívuma a játéknak, hogy a Descenttel (Odalenttel) ellentétben a tengerészgyalogosok szerepe hihetetlenül nehéz. Itt is ki lehet találni viszont könnyítéseket ennek megoldására.

RATING: 6
Potentially the best Kevin Wilson after Arkham Horror, imho. Rated 6 because of the so typically Wilsonesque thwarted strategising and related frustrating sense of impotence for the marines in the face of the master's cards, and because of the apparently insane difficulty of the scenarios (were they ever playtested??)

1vAll dungeon crawl that takes no prisoners! Feels pretty unique in its genre I think due to the port of flavor rules from the video game. Fast paced, and collecting pickups on the map is pretty fun. Like most dungeon crawls, I wish there were more strategy, but it's fun and nostalgic and forgiven. Also think there will be more room for tactics with more marines cooperating. I only played 2 player so far.

Most direct competition is Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel.

Conservative rating for now.

Descent's little brother who actually gets it right and does not have the balance issues. The Overlord may be a tad stronger than the Marines (especially with some unbalanced and really evil cards in his deck), but if you treat him more as a GM than an enemy it is great fun. And if you want to play competitively get the expansion, here you have cards that weaken the Overlord.

Don't get me wrong! Doom is an unplugged replica of its predecessor and props to Kevin Wilson for making it so. Run into a room, grab the goodies, and run the hell out. Never stop firing. Just like the computer game!

That said, why would I ever play Doom when I could play Space Hulk?

RATING: 7
Descent's predecessor is fun, but I'm more of a fantasy guy.  The difference in mechanics, while small, still makes them quite different in gameplay.  One of the biggest changes is that you can run out of ammunition in Doom, while in Descent you're fully stocked.

RATING: 7
The lighter predecessor of Descent, Doom is a fun game in its own right.  I think that, generally speaking, if I have enough time to play Doom I'd just play Descent instead, that's not necessarily true of my more sci-fi minded friends.  So Doom might actually see the table more often.

I really liked it, so that's fine by me.

Fantasy fighting games are low on my interest list, so I can see where most will enjoy Doom much more than I do.  I played with five and it's a little too slow, not to mention the lengthy setup.  The dice battles are fun enough to marginally hold my interest.

I can't even classify DOOM as a game if there's no way to win it.  How did it ever get out of playtesting?  Flatly impossible, DOOM is a Kobayashi-Maru even with mercy house rules to give players an edge.  This is not a game, it's punishment.  Spending money on DOOM is one of the greatest mistakes you can make in your FLGS.

[Based on a few plays]  I have played as the monsters and the marines.  It is an okay game that seems especially well suited toward playing with middle school/high school boys.  IMO Descent is a vast improvment on the core rules of this game.  This game (and Descent for that matter) both take too long to play for me to really enjoy.  I end up being slightly bored and tired of playing by the time it finishes.  The original dice wear out quickly and are crap.

Oh so much fun to be had with this. Lots of agonising decisions to be made by the players, and plenty of stomping and fun for the invader. The pieces are a wonder, and a scenario reaching it's end creates a gameboard that would make any gamer grin from ear to ear.
Amend - I got my hands on Descent. I don't play this now.

RATING: 1
Loved Space Hulk and Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel.  I rate this a 1 because as written, the game is not playable.  Invader being able to spawn each turn in the same room as the players makes it impossible for marines to move forward - closing doors only makes things worse for the marines because then the invader spawns behind the them and opens them instantly.  Marines can potentially run out of ammo IN THEIR FIRST TURN and be left with having only fists to fight with the rest of the game.  Combined with constant re-spawning by the Invader, Marines potentially face the following scenario: fighting monsters in 1 room with their fists, forever, until they die.  Such game design is inexcusable - this is not a game as written, and can only be played currently by forcing the Invader to play as a "dungeon master" and simply not harass the marines (no dud cards, no respawning).  Could be fixed by house rules, perhaps (no dud cards, no spawning in areas already cleared of monsters), but I write this as a caution to anyone expecting a rollicking ride.  This ain't Doom, because Doom is all about shooting.  This game is all about watching your ammo get flushed down the toilet then getting ganked by respawns.

This game is just too long and boring which is odd because I expected to like it.  It isn't that I don't enjoy long games eitherl  With some games the time flies because I am having fun and it doesn't seem like 4 hours have passed, but with this game every hour that goes by is painful.  I have played as a marine and as the invader and haven't had fun with either.  As a marine, it is too easy to run out of ammo and have to resort to weak weapons that don't do much damage and leave you very vulnerable.  The game just doesn't seem to be balanced well.  I have seen games where the marines have won very easily and I have seen games where the invader has just dominated the marines but I have never seen a game in the middle.  So there is never any tension to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It bills itself as a fast-n-furious shoot-em-up, when it's actually a tension filled game where the marines stand a good chance of getting plastered. 

I don't think it's a bad game, but having a game called "Doom" in which you don't run-and-gun seems odd.

Look at Siege of the Citadel for a better "Doom Experience."

In a recent purchase, I was *heavily* considering adding Descent to my order.  It just has everything I *think* I love in a game...fantasy theme, RPG elements, leveling up, stats, equipment, looting?  You name it!  It just seemed like the perfect crossover if you love RPG's.

So, I decided to buy Doom.

Don't ask me how that happened...something about shorter play time and a more tense feel changed my mind.  Oh, and I loved playing Doom back in the day!  That, and Duke Nukem!  haha

Pipe bomb, for the win!

Ya...so, I'm really looking forward to playing this.

Update 12/2009: Played first game with three marines (I was the invader).  We used some modifications to help the marines.  Turns out we may have used "too many" modifications, as the marines pretty much soared through the first map.  Invader scored only 1 kill point.  The marines had fun, but it wasn't challenging.  Need to reconsider the changes we used.

As a kid/teenager, I played MB's HeroQuest.
And just when I thought "They should do a game like HeroQuest again", FFG published DOOM.
The game looks beautiful, and compared to HeroQuest offers far more tactical depth. It was also refreshing that the Invader Player (the evil guy) is a real opponent for the marine (hero) players, and not just a storyteller or the guy to bring the hero fodder into position.
There are a lot of different skills for the marines that bring versatility into the game. This adds to the replay-value of the game. Even if you were to play the same scenario again and again,it will be with a different group of marines every time, and they all will need their very own approach and tactics.
The game can be really tough for the marine players (especially when inexperienced), but can easily be tweaked (more health/ammunition/armour) to make it a bit easier for the marines.
Some people complain about the game being too long, and I can see where they are coming from - but I don't mind playing for hours when I'm enjoying myself.

Clean combat system with awesome dice. Love the fact that everything (range, hit/miss, damage) gets resolved in a single die roll. Found it rather difficult to win as the marines though, and especially dislike the rule that you lose weapons when you get fragged. I mean, what's the point of picking up the BFG if you know that the OL is probably going to frag you next turn!? Would have preferred if the weapons re-appeared in their starting locations, otherwise marines would eventually lose all good weapons in the game as they get fragged.

09/01/08: Found out today that we were playing the "fragged" rules incorrectly. When fragged, you only lose additional Armor and the Beserk token (if you have it). Weapons and ammo are not lost. Would definately need to re-play this game.

A vicious dungeon-crawler, this is no walk in the park.  There are some really great elements here, notably the incredible minis and fun, efficient dice combat.  The difficulty is maybe a bit too much, but I like the challenge it presents and it's simple enough to use some houserules or allow the GM some flexibility to make an easier game.

It's too bad FFG has abandoned the franchise.  I'd appreciate more official support/expansions.

UPDATE: I played Doom again after it collected dust for about 5 years.  Yeesh.  What a plodding dinosaur of game design.  It's amazing how much "Dudes in a Corridor" games have advanced in the past few years, with much better titles such as Earth Reborn, Claustrophobia, and Mice & Mystics having been released since I'd played this last.

Its problems come from two sources: 1) the seemingly neverending parade of spawned monsters available in the Invader deck, and 2) the dice combat, which causes far too many misses.  What should be a fast and fun action/adventure game becomes frustratingly slow due to the constant bottlenecks of enemies that take too long to frag.  

The difficulty mods from the expansion are a must, but they're not enough to salvage the game.  These awesome components deserve a better game.

A fantastic game system, which would have been a classic if it was playtested a bit more. Houserules are needed to fully enjoy this game, but once you've found the right balance the game is great fun to play.

I have some concerns about the play balance, it seems easy to run out of ammo and get over run as a marine player. But since I've played only once so far it may be premature for me to say it's impossible for the humans to win. At any rate, I like the co-op play, and the presentation is truly top-notch

Run & Gun games, I just love them for some strange reason. Game play is fast and tactical with lots of decisions to make every turn. My rating is based on the game system...not the original scenarios that come with it. It is a scenario based game and many folks judge the game based on a scenario or two and not the game play. There are lots of fun and balanced scenarios available online.

Lots of fun, I'd recommend using a timer for the marines, 2-3 mins for all of them.

RATING: 6
Rating is based on an initial play with maximum player count.

Doom seems pretty cool, but you can definitely tell it was designed before Descent.  There is a great game screaming to be let out of here, but the ammo mechanic and endless Invader power cards make for a tough Marine play through.

I will definitely play this again, but it is one of the only games I've played recently where I found myself really wishing for house rules on the first play through.

RATING: 7.5
So, [thing=10640][/thing], as many of you know, is the rib bone from which [thing=17226][/thing] came to be. Is has, basically, the same rules, as the marines (heroes) can:

- Run (two moves);
- Unload (two attacks);
- Advance (one move and one attack);
- Or Ready (one move or attack, then prepare an action: Guard, Dodge or Aim).

The invader leader, in his turn can:

- Activate the invaders (each of them can make one move and one attack);
- Play cards (some in his turn - to place more invaders - all of them outside the LOS of the marines, for example; others in the marines turn - to jam a weapon, or use a Dud card to make the marine lose one ammo, and many other things).

The rooms of the scenarios are open one by one, as the doors are opened - this is a simple thing, but I enjoyed this way much more than the one in the [thing=104162][/thing], where the map is all prepared in the beginning.

Also, the ammo is a great thing: it makes for a more tense game, since every shot must count: if the marine is out of ammo, he can only use his fists!

One thing the game lacks, though, is in the characterisation of the marines: none of them has a name, nor different attributes - one is only apart from the other by the special cards they receive in the start of the game. The game, being a thematic one, could use more background for the marines, even if they didn't had unique attributes.

At the start of the first scenario - Knee Deep in the Dead - I thought the marines would power through the whole thing with not much trouble. I was wrong - when I started to get cards like Dud, Rage, and others that allowed me to put more invaders - all that changed, and the marines was fighting for almost every step they took. Only halfway through the marines realized that they should use the Ready actions more, and have more space between them so to cover more ground with their LOS. But by then, I already had 4 frags and the ammo of the marines was really low. They still went to the big room of the scenario, but the big monsters ended their run. So it appears that [thing=10640][/thing] requires a lot of cooperation, table-talk to acess the situation and make decisions, and some luck in the dice roll (at least to avoid losing ammo). The special skill cards were all good, which is great - no one was "ahh, I wish I had that one, and not this one".

The game gives a solid experience as to how a team os soldiers should act: covering areas, advancing in formation, reading themselves for thins that might come. Really well done.

Overall it was an awesome experience and I want to play more as soon as possible.

RATING: 8
[Rated 2005/04/18 based on 1 play]

Has a lot of the flavour of Space Hulk, absolutely dripping with theme and quality components.

Played with three marines, there seemed to be plenty of opportunity for the marines to discuss tactics, and several different ways for them to approach the scenario.  On the other side, the invader (me, in this first play) could run the whole gamut from elaborate traps to a simple 'pick a marine and put 'em through the grinder' approach.  The invader cards, which cycle pretty rapidly in a four player game, keep things fresh - the marines never know *exactly* what's coming, and the invader  has to be pretty fluid as you can't guarantee to draw (or hang on to) all the cards you want.

The scenarios supplied represent a good slice of gaming - the marines are unlikley to win many first time through, although it didn't seem as unbalanced as some reviews suggest.  When you're done, there's plenty of supplemental material out there, both official and from the community.

Two criticisms: it's almost impossible to get it all back in the box neatly, and the 90 mins playing time stated is *way* too low.  One for a weekend all-day session or a con, rather than an evening game.

This rating may partly be nostalgia for the group I was playing with.  One of the best coop experiences I've had.

This is notably better than Descent because the movement is much more interesting with all guns than with some melee-only characters.  Also because Doom is harder.

Fun theme, but terribly unbalanced rules.  If you play the marines and know you are just going to get wasted it has some playability, but if you actually want to have your decisions mean something, DO NOT play this game.
Also the long set-up time (both to start and when new areas are seen), means you are not getting much fun for the time spent unless you are the aliens!

In Doom: The Boardgame, demonic invaders have broken through from another dimension into the Union Aerospace Corporation’s Mars base. Marines have been deployed to the base to protect UAC personnel and destroy the invaders. Up to three players will take the roles of heavily armed and highly trained marines, while one player will control the legion of demonic invaders. In the game, the marine players explore the claustrophobic rooms and corridors of the Mars base, attacking monsters, picking up new weapons and equipment, and working together to complete specific mission objectives.

Nice game.  Enjoyed it quite a bit.  Liked the scenario aspect of the game.  Played with only 2 players but it came down to the wire with either player having an opportunity to win.  Although the marine player (me) did get severely beaten down and had a few unlucky roles, I felt that I had a chance to win in the end.  The game was a bit too long, but this could be attributed to first time play or because each new section is revealed as you go. Need to play a couple of more times to determine if I will change my rating.

Simple to learn and play, the game captures the feel of the overwhelming odds against the marines, but doesn't capture the tense feeling of being hunted in the way, say, spacehulk does. The odds are in favor of the invader player, but I hear this is corrected with the expansion, which means I suppose the expansion is a must for this game. Very fun but alittle unsatifying if the invading player wins, which he does frequently.

I took me 6 years to play this, but I am glad I finally got the chance. It proved to me that games have not evolved that much, as I enjoyed it (much) more than more recent games of this ilk (Castle Ravenloft springs to mind). It might run a little long, but the proceedings felt pretty streamlined and downtime wasn't bad. More importantly, unlike more recent FFG offerings, there weren't 266 card texts to keep track of, so I could focus my attention to the teamplay it required. Love to play again, even though I am not a big fan of the Doom universe.

We just played our first game (2 player), and I loved it.  I haven't gotten to play many miniature games, so this fills a void.  The rules are surprisingly clean and efficient, but there is alot you can do.  I put all the tiles and items for each new area in zip lock bags, so it was fairly easy to setup each new area.  We set the marine difficulty down a bit since I wanted to approach this as more of an adventure/rpg game than as a competative combat game, and it worked great!  The rating is a touch lower due to the game length making it hard to bring out.

I enjoyed this game, however the rules are a little overwhelming at first and it took the marines a little while to realize the point was not to kill everyhthing.  Because of this we felt like the monsters had the edge no matter what we did. I can't wait to play again though.  

Update: Got the expansion, awesome game with the expansion.

Excellent game in terms of components, clarity of rules and atmosphere. It's also a blast to play, especially with 3 marines. Yes, the scenarios are tough to win as the marines, but that can be tweaked easily in a variety of ways ( increasing starting health points or the number of frags required to win, for example). The only thing keeping this game from a 10 is that the set up for the game is kind of a pain.

I love Doom: The Videogame, and the boardgame does a great job of converting the atmosphere of the game into a multiplayer experience.  The "rules" of Doom (healthpacks, Berserk Packs, etc.) are implemented well, enough so that I was sure we were getting a rule wrong because it didn't make sense with what I knew about the video game, and the unbalanced sides make the struggle seem more realistic.  My only complaints are the frequency with which you are likely to lose ammo (which doesn't respawn) and the length of the game.  Otherwise, a commendable effort!

The bases on the large figures tend to warp, turning the mighty Cyberdemon into a rocking horse.  Easily fixed with some hot water.  There is some downtime while going into a new area.  Some balance issues with more than one marine as well, but FFG's fix helps.

RATING: 5
This game is downright brutal for the marines.  Even with excellent positioning, a couple of poor rolls or a single Invader card combination at the wrong moment can literally ruin any chance of a successful mission.  To have a chance at winning, the marines must draw a powerful skill combination, play well, and get lucky.  Generally, the Invader draws enough cards that there is little need for hand management.  Simply playing as many cards as possible every turn is usually more than enough to defeat the marines.

More often than not, Doom: The Boardgame feels like an excercise in futility.  The 3-4 hour playing time only serves to compound the frustration when the marines lose and have to start all over again.  

If you get this game, be sure to implement some of the mods to help fix gameplay.  I recommend the following:

Hey, Not Too Rough  (Alternately: Use Standardized Marines)
---Each marine gets +2 Wounds and +2 Bullets/Shells.
---Invader's hand size is limited to 7 Cards.

Well-Trained for 3 players 
---Each marine gets 3 Marine Cards and selects 2 to keep.

Semi-Organized Marines
---After selecting marine cards, marines choose a permanent order of play.

Semi-Unending Pistols
---Pistols never use ammo, but you must have bullets/shells to fire them.

'Not Quite' cards may not affect keys.

Note: Dud card was revised (see FAQ).
      Invader draws 2 cards always (see FAQ).

A number of good ideas, and a few not so good. My biggest gripe is the lack of differentiation in weapons (and the decision to have fists be so strong). Cannot deny the great bits and strong theme (though a sci-fi game with gates into "hell" is a pretty stupid mix), and it is a fun experience.

Let down slightly by the lopsided balance. VERY difficult for the marine players to win, especially with 3 marines vs the bad guys. Even with various house rules to make things a bit easier (get ammo when you respawn, draw extra skill cards at start) it is still a very rough ride for the marines, unless the overlord player deliberately throws the game. Compared with its fantasy counterpart Descent, this game is inferior.

Swedish/Danish edition, but I traded the Danish stuff away for another set of Swedish rules and cards.

Having two rule-books is nice, the Swedish rules are strangely translated in places, and sometimes not even translated at all.  We just played our first game and having two full sets of the rules was a blessing.

Otherwise the game is nice, the minis (although cheaply made) make the game come real.  The movement-system used by the marines is a lot nicer than the one in Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel, which in most other respects is a very similar game.

edit: given away in a math trade. Kind of sorry to see it go :(

purchased Dec19, 2004. First impression after one game. Not bad. There seems a reasonable number of options for the marines for a fice-fest (fighten with dice). I love the angst created with marines opening doors and awaiting the horror that lays behind it! Traded July 2006. For reasons that was never played, and duration of playtime was too long IMO.

This games rocks, it is better than Space Hulk (both editions).  Update, A year on I have sold this due to the greater amount of time it takes to play it as compared to Space Hulk and some rule flaws which showed up after we played it many times. Sold it

RATING: 7
Superior to Descent in many ways because power-ups occur within the "dungeon" (no returning to town, etc.), and - due to a division-based armor/wound system rather than Descent's subtraction-based system -  characters don't eventually become one-blow killing machines.

Doom is also so insanely difficult that you can lose in only 15 minutes, versus a 7-hour Descent loss.  Great system, but clearly has the least-tested game scenarios ever.

[i]Update:[/i]

It's now an annual tradition to "enhance" our Doom session at WBC by choosing one particular game and using that game's flavor text to randomly accentuate important kills and actions. We've never had more fun, and we've never seen passers-by more confused.  Simply awesome. 

Recent flavor text selections: Herd Your Horses (year 1), Mission to Ecuador (year 2). Hearing the Soul Cube scream out biblical verse at inopportune moments has got to be one of my top 5 gaming highlights ever.

Played several scenarios when this first came out. It was an enjoyable afternoon. Nothing really new here but a solid game. Basically a dungeon crawl.

Personally I prefer this to Descent and Space Hulk. Though it certainly borrowed from it. Plays faster than Descent and the appearing monster mechanics just work better for me. However that could well be the memories of the PC game :)

{Expansion}
More Doom! More mini's, More fun PLUS CTF and Death Match :)

Played a CTF match with 6 marines and Scenario 1 with my wife.  Screwed up a lot of rules in the scenario.  Didn't seem very fair.  Got kind of boring with just the two of us.  Needs more plays and players I suppose.
2/20/08 - Got to play as the marines and won.  It was very close though but lots of fun.  I love Recon.

I really like this.  Can be played cooperatively and competitively with the expansion.  My only reservation is the fiddly nature and time to play.  There are lots of do-dads to keep from losing.

RATING: 7
Fun.
Yes the marines get killed a lot, but that's how it should be. If you can live with the hard life of a marine, its great fun and the co-op is nice. 

The expansion is a must buy.

Update 2011:
After playing Decent (and the expansions), I must say that Decents is better.

Update 2013:
Still a fun game, but won't hit the table anymore. To many better games. But the theme still wins..

WAY better than base Descent IMO. All the mechanics (like monsters randomly spawning) just make more sense in the Doom setting, which makes sense because this game came first. Would ALWAYS choose Doom over Descent. Doom is a *game*. Descent is... something else.

IMHO this is a better game than Space Hulk: more options, more tactics...against a competent evil player it is a very, very difficult game for the marines. My advice is using every mod for favouring the marines. I also use a house rule for limiting the number of weapons that a marine can carry, otherwise it is ridiculous.

Ugh! I came into this game with high expectations. I was a fan of the original game, back in the day, having finished it. However, the board game is fiddly and weighted against the players from room one. I think part of the problem is the stuff that the "evil player" draws is just too overpowering. (In the original game, if you cleared out a section, that gave you a safe area to run back to, which was important to strategy.) In our game, Evil spawned new baddies every turn making our task impossible, and certainly not enjoyable. I give this game an extra bonus point (from 2 to 3) for the metric buttload of finely crafted bits that come with the game.

RATING: 6.8
A good history lesson, this one is the grand daddy of the more streamlined FFG games like Star Wars: Imperial Assault and Descent. In comparison Doom felt a bit clumsy and long in the tooth, it took way, way too long to play a 4 player game due to getting bogged down by tons of monsters and endless dice rolling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The bits are nice, but I found the gameplay a bit tedious. Fun with the right group of people, to be sure, but for the space epic blasting game, I'd far prefer Space Hulk or Siege of the Citadel.

One of a kind! Good guys vs. the "bad" guy (not evil, simply misunderstood!). Move, shoot, hide behind a corner, stay on guard, etc. - lots of stuff to do.

Damn hard for the marines but people like it! You can play each scenario lots of times, each time a bit diffrent, until you do it perfectly!

It needs something to extend the standard game + expansion but there are some people here at the BBG working on it. Cannot wait till they give us a proper campaign tool with something to balance this great game!

Had a hard time understanding why they chose to make ammo use a randomized factor. Maybe if marines respawned with what they had and dropped the weapons when they died. Didn't like the feel.

I think I will stick to Spacehulk.

Played one game with my son and was totally underwhelmed. Can't take the fluorescent coloured monsters seriously. The tension thats supposed to be an important part of it was just lacking. We need to give this another go. 

.. edit: I dry brushed (ie with my fingers) a silvery paint/paste over all the fluorescent monsters, and then painted them with Dark Oak wood varnish. They look better and far more intimidating. The colours still show through enough to be able to distinguish them but not enough to distract.

edit: 6 months later and for some reason the varnish has gone tacky. EEK! So I'm looking to get another copy to replace the figures.

I now own the expansion but haven't got round to playing it. The setup time keeps feeling prohibitive.

6 for the components but the fiddlyness of set up puts us off.

Sold

Promising, but broken. The scenarios, while presented as "adventures" where the Marines aren't supposed to know what's ahead, can only be won if the Marines know *exactly* what's ahead. Keep to two alien cards a round and buff the Marines for a better experience.

Kann eine Videospielumsetzung ein gutes Brettspiel sein? Noch dazu von einem stumpfen Egoshooter? Jawoll, das Doom Brettspiel überzeugt durch Taktik und eine ansprechende Aufmachung. Auch wenn es verdammt schwer ist eines meiner Lieblingsspiele!

Feels like Space Hulk with a twist. Seems to work quite well with more than two players. Don't know what else to say at this point. Add-on costs way too much?

Great game that immediately reminded me of a modern Space Hulk.  It can be quite long if you have methodical players (as marines), but thats probably necessary as its BLOODY hard for the marines to win... A few annoyances with ammo etc, but I enjoy a tough game, and this is certainly that.

Quite mathy, but with elements of psychology as well as a good dose of luck.  I think its a pretty fun game and can have some seriously tense/exciting moments!

The only race game I know without die or cards. I don't think Breaking Away will replace Ave Caesar as THE racing game of choice to close an evening but it is not a bad alternative at all. There's plenty of scope to screw the other players and it will reward good play more than Ave Caesar does. A little long for what it is though

have only played once with people that weren't really into it so tough for me to get a true reading on this. seems like one where the players need to have at least a passing interest/knowledge of cycling to get into.  the low quality bits are a bit off putting as well, some expected a lighter game.

RATING: 6
A fun game of.. bike racing.  I like how manipulation of the ordering is the central mechanic.  Staying towards the back of the pack has a distinct benefit, but remains untenable as a long-term strategy.  A lot of balance inherent to the game and rules.  I'd play this occasionally.

RATING: 7
Cycling race with an interesting mechanism for the bike movement. Its a fun game without too much thinking required. Generally quite competitive with players who score lots of points early on finding their riders tailing off as they have used up too many movement points allowing the rest of the riders to be there at the finish. Works best with large number of players.

Only played once so far... The game started out slow until a familiarity with the rules and system was reached. Then the game moved along at a reasonable pace but it very likely has the potential to drag in the wrong circumstances. Seemed a little too dry for some players but those who aren’t averse to abstracts or the analytical types may find a lot to enjoy here.

A really fantastic cycling game : Very tactical and a bit of playing poker : when do I break away or stay in the wheel. This game started with a 9-score, but the more I play it, the more I love it. I will play this game allways in the rememberance of the Great Geert Lagrou, who introduced me in the world of games.
Unbelievable that this game never was picked up by a major company : this is without any concurrence the best racing game ever made

Looked great with all those cyclist figures and I've only played a few times. Still haven't worked out the right strategy. Check out the great image (187986) for this game.

Update - Have now played this several times and I am really impressed by how the mechanics simulate (albeit abstractly) a cycle race with sprint sections.

Further plays in our 4 player gaming session - superb

Great game, best racing game going for my money. Much better than 6 Tag Rennen, far more interesting than Formula De, and very good with 6 players, which is rare. An expansion is available for 7-8, but it gets a little crowded. Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really interesting race game where the game is entirely about positioning rather than any luck of the die or card play.

At the beginning of the race, you determine 3 movement values for each of your riders. On a turn, you'll use one of those three values, carrying the other 2 into the next round. The value you used will be replaced with a new number, which is higher the more riders you're drafting at the end of the current round. So, you always have three possible movement values for each of your riders, and you're posturing to replace them with higher numbers when possible, and deciding when to use those high values to sprint out into the lead.

Just a really need game of posturing and timing, with the only "luck" being table randomness with what the other players choose to do. Unique and fun!

RATING: 7
Easily the best racing game I've played. Breaking Away manages to simulate a cycling race in an elegant manner.The game whets my appetite for more, e.g. curves, elevation, road width possibly restricting overtaking, risk of peleton accidents making the rear positions a little more risky etcetc.

RATING: 8
Awesome no-luck race game. Feels like the perfect length when playing, and a variety of strategy and tactics are available. Plus, it's really fun. Can suffer if people take too long pondering moves and it loses the feel of a race. Because of the increase in drafting opportunities, the game plays faster as players are added. Needs at least 4, probably 5.

RATING: 7
I enjoy race games, probably largely due to the ease with which one can discern what is going on.  But one drawback with race games is that when you're behind, you're behind.  Breaking Away is one of the few exceptions to that; it resembles other strategy games in that one is constantly having to juggle the short-term payoff against the long term consideration.  This game unfolds more like a narrative than most of the games I own, you're planning and adjusting your away through a journey.  The components are cheap but I find them charming.  The game does sometimes induce clerical errors that ruin the results, and sometimes multiplayer chaos rules.  Still fun, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have to admit that I have very little experience with racing games, so I don't have much to compare this with.  The movement mechanism is somewhat realistic, and the simultaneous action makes it important to try to predict what other players are going to do with their cycling teams.  As with many other simultaneous auction/action games, watching the hivemind at work is interesting.

RATING: 6
Breaking Away is an old-school style game, at least it feels that way because of the requirement for pencil and paper, as well as calculation. The game challenges you to plan out your first couple of turns carefully by allocating your movement points carefully, and then to just wing it the rest of the way, working as efficiently as possible.

The jockeying for position in this is the game, and in that regard more players seems to be for the best. More players also has the virtue of increasing the speed of the game, since your riders refresh their power for subsequent rounds based on how mahy people are in the pack in front of them (cutting down on the wind resistence). I think even with 6 the game played a bit long though...it's not that I didn't enjoy myself, but it seemed to play out longer than I was completely comfortable with. This probably just means I would like it more with 7 or 8, though I don't think this is a game I would personally recommend. Fun enough though, no problem playing it, but not spectacular either.

A bike-racing game that at first glance looks like it will be a quick game - but there&#039;s no luck - just planning your moves carefully, and that takes some time,  especially with 6 players.  Fun game,  but more of a brain-burner than I expected!

I want to "play" games.  When you were in 8th grade, your Algebra teacher never told you to "play" your homework, did he?  Breaking Away is competitive math.  

Now that I've "bashed" the game, let me say that this game works well with a large group, I had fun playing it, and because "Math R Hard" for some of us, I have absolutely no idea how to do well in this game.

This is the single best gaming representation of cyclists on an oval track that I have played. The feel of the riders clustering in a pack to draft from other riders is really well-designed.

I will agree with others that there is some math involved with this game, but the main mechanic of the game is having to guess similar numbers to the rest of the players.  If you pick badly on your first 2 turns out of the gate, you are basically screwed for the rest of the game with no chance of ever being in the race.

I don't mind games that punish you for making bad decisions and don't really have a catch-up mechanic, but this game punishes you for guessing badly compared to the other players.

This is a horrible game and I will never play it again.

I think this is an awesome game, however it's hard getting my friends and family to feel the same way about it.  Their lack of enthusiasm will make this tough to bring out, and harder for me to enjoy.  Personally, I didn't imagine it would be as fun as it is.  I would play it at any opportunity if I had 5-6 players.  I definitely prefer mounted boards, though, so a sheet of plexiglass wouldn't hurt.

This bicycle racing game was on my want list for several years due to good reviews and because there is no luck element. It also caught my attention because one of my favorite old movies is, Breaking Away. I had a hard time finding it for sale, but eventually purchased it through the publisher's website in England.

I was surprised when I received the game because I had never read anything that suggested it was home made. It came in a padded envelope. Inside there was a small, flimsy gift box like the kind you get at a department store where you fold out the corners to make into a shirt box. A label is pasted on top. Instructions are off the home printer and stapled. Included is a sheet of office supply 1/4" sticky dots and you are instructed to get a pen and write numbers on them & stick them on the bikes. (This wasn't adequate, so I used black & silver permanent Sharpies & wrote the numbers on the bikes--even looks better & is much easier to read.) The Sprint Point Cards are either laser or ink jet printed and you are instructed to get scissors and cut them apart. (I laminated these because otherwise, after a few plays they would be toast.) The game board is a quarter fold on about the same cardboard weight as the box, but nicely glossed so that it is sturdier than the box. Also included are movement sheets, zip locks, and a set of very nice plastic cyclists. Even though the game was very expensive--the price of a higher end retail game, I now understand why the game is not sold through retailers, but only through Fiendish Games--it is not just a self-published, but a homemade game. I am glad to support independent designers; I had just made assumptions about the game and the reality was shocking, that is all. 

I ordered the extra team colors: purple, pink, silver, gold, brown and orange. The “gold” bikes I painted gold to distinguish them from the similar brown bikes. With the extra bikes I am assuming we can play with more than 9--we'll see. (I am very afraid of brain burning with some players--that may put a limit on the number of players. Maybe I should incorporate a timer--it is a race after all.)

I was very leery, despite the reviews, that I would get my money's worth from this costly game. And yes, it is worth what I paid, and this is a super game. I have many racing games--sled, horse, many car, more bike, ski, boat, etc.--and I this is the best of the best.

The rules are well written, and the example of play in the beginning of a race is excellent.

I can't think of another race game that is pure strategy--I am sure all my other race games use either cards or dice. 

Bike movement is calculated on paper, but not complex at all. Very straight forward. The mechanics of how the bikes gain movement, especially by drafting and "breaking away", is clever indeed. The race feels realistic with the bunching together, falling behind, and sprinting. 

Just finishing the race does not win the game--there are two other scoring points (sprint lines)in the race. The game is over when 8 cyclists cross the finish line, but the winner is the one with the most points, which makes the winner less obvious, even though cumulative points are open knowledge.

This game looks crummy (looks like a first-stage proto-type) & the box is so flimsy have to place it carefully so it doesn't get crushed, but it is a winner, and can't wait to play it again. So despite its lousy production there is a good chance this rating will go up (which it has).

EDIT: Added 3 items to the game. First I did add a 30 sec timer. If there are 9 (or more players) and each takes 2 minutes to move 4 cyclists, that is around 20 minutes per round. There are a lot of rounds, so we are still talking a long game. Secondly, I added a disk to be placed under the solitary leader (if there is one) because a round can last so long there might be forgetfulness & disagreement in whether or not there is a new solitary leader, because movement is calculated differently, it is important.  The 3rd item is a plexiglass sheet laid over the top to keep the map flat.

The local game store has a proto-type DGT Cube--a digital times for up to 6 players that keeps track of cumulative time, but it is estimated to be $50. This timer would be so much better because bikes move in order--one player doesn't move all their bikes at once. Some bikes might only take a second to move, while others need more thought. A total of 2 minutes per round is more reasonable, instead of 4 bikes at a max of 30 seconds each. 

High accolades from my gaming group. (Comment when first seen, "Is this a prototype?)  Timer not needed with 5.

RATING: 8.5
After the first play with three players (all newbies). Breaking away 'feels like' such a bike race looks like. An ingenious system of initial point allocation for your 1 through 4 bikes (1>2>3>4) into three boxes (a fourth is optional for your #1 rider). The riders are cycled through (pun intended) from #1's then 2's, 3's then 4's with each player selecting one of the 3(4) numbers previously allocated (and crossed off) then the remaining sets are dropped down for availability the next turn(s).

Then, the ingenious part, each rider is allocated a new 'speed number' based upon his/her relative position to those contiguously in front of them (3   # of bikes contiguously in front of you). Woe be the rider who has a gap in front of them. Eventually you'll have to choose that new 'speed number' and other new 'speed numbers' determined at the end of each movement phase (1st bike first (inside bike first over outside bike in same space)).

The first turn that any a bike breaks away from the pack (so there is a gap between that bike and the next bike behind it) instead of 3   # of contiguous bikes in front of him (as there are none) the breakaway bike gets but the # of gaps between it and the next bike behind him (which could be a little as 1 - no 3 is added to it). The next turn he'll get 3   as normal (but of course he will have his breakaway number available for his next turn).

The race will ebb and flow and any bike left behind the pack for a few turns is permanently 'dead in the water' as it will only get the 3 number to replace the number used for that turn.
Very nice (bike) racing game.

What's interesting about this game is that the result of the movement mechanism looks and feels very much like a bicycle race, but the mental processes required to strategize within the game do not.

For a game with no random elements, Breaking Away manages to feel quite chaotic because of all the hidden information combined with the butterfly effect of players' decisions.  The game's simple, deterministic scheme does an outstanding job of modeling a road bicycle race.  It's all there: saving vs. expending energy, where to position yourself in the field, breaking away, sacrificing teammates to protect a sprinter, the hopeless position of those falling behind the peloton.  No crashes though.

After searching for a while, I finally got a hold of a copy of Breaking Away. We played it with 6 or 7 and it was the first game for everyone. The rules seemed a bit confusing, so it took us a while to figure out what we were suppose to be doing. But, for some of us it started clicking. A little too late. Unfortunately, a couple players were feeling it as much and were trying hard to make sure others weren't enjoying it. Even going so far as wanting to quit before the end because 'it was obvious how it was going to end'. I made them finish it out in order to see how things would play out. I knew it was as obvious as he thought. Sure enough the 'leaders' of that pack 'died' at the line and others past by. I really liked how the movement worked and how there was a lot of back and forth. My timing was completely off, but I enjoyed the 'ride' anyway.

An unusual game in that the more people that play, the quicker the game moves! Definitely some group think here and the first game is probably going to be a learning game.

There is this interesting mix of drafting behind other bikers to get increased movement for future turns or when should you break away to go for points.

A few tips that won't make sense until you've played:
1. Most of the time on the first turn everyone will play a 1 on their biker. This could just be a group think thing among those that I've played, but it feels like you get burned if don't jump on that turn one bandwagon. So put a 1 in your starting numbers for all bikers!
2. Paint the biker helmets the same color as the sticker on the wheel. It is hard to see the sticker on the wheel when all the bikers are lined up closely.

Nicely captures the feel of track cycling in a game with print & play quality components. In spite of there being no randomness, there's still a huge chaos factor, as there's no way of knowing (short of having a perfect memory) which moves a player has available, never mind which one they'll choose. So in theory the game's a doddle, stick at the back of the peloton until you're 2 moves away from a scoring point, then try to race to the front. It's just the execution...

A very abstract modelling of a cycling race. Aspects of second-guessing, adding up numbers, and controlling turn order so that you cross certain thresholds early but without having to leave the pack behind entirely. Probably a bit dry, but theoretically fast. Sensitive to player count. Decidedly preferable to Um Reifenbreite.

EDIT:  Recently I purchased the new Japanese edition.  Quite nice!  It only supports 5 players.  But otherwise is a much nicer edition to play upon.

ORIGINAL COMMENT:  Component wise this game is a disappointment.  Old fashioned, it uses written records.  But, I am impressed.  This is a very good game!  Now, would someone make a nice edition, please?

I store my copy of "Devil Take the Hindmost" in this box.

Breaking Away isn't only a strikingly good simulation of a bike race, but also a fun racing game that works very well even with 6 players. One of the few luck free games I like.

Not bad, not bad at all. Better than Um Reifenbreite, but there are some problems too: the game takes too long!

I'm not a big racing fan but this one I like.  It mimicks the concepts of drafting/slipstreaming fairly well, only slightly similiar with Um Reifenbreite.  Also, this is an indoor track race in three scoring segments.  Considering the components, I wish this were cheaper.  If you've got six play Breakaway and if you've got four, I'd lean towards Um Reifenbreite.  For something lighter, try Formel Fun (with the Turfmaster Variant posted).

The yellow jersey of cycling games.  At the centre of the game is the calculation of movement (a triumph of simplicity) which powers a beautiful game; recreating the strategy, tension and exertion of a real cycling race.  The history of the game - a long period of PBEM - has provided it with a strong basis of playtesting and the current incarnation is an efficient and effective game.  Though it may appear homemade (it pretty much is), we are sometimes spoilt by the production values of modern games, this should be celebrated and shouldn't lose focus from a great game (a cycling analogy would be with Graeme Obree's bike ... and look what that went on to achieve).  John Harrington is a legend, the king of the mountains and the king of the racing game.

Great bike racing game and not as "mathy" as it seems. No cards or dice involved. The more I play this one, the more I like it. The movement mechanism is so unlike other race games, I find it fascinating. Rivaling Ave Caesar as my favorite race game of all time.

Great game! Really interesting decisions on where to try to position your guys. This game somewhat reminds me of a non-deterministic random number generating iterative function. Very fun and hard to predict!
After being away from the game for a time I find I still want to play it again but I'm concerned a little that a player may be taken out of the running by pure luck rather than poor play which bothers me a little.

I really liked the game, although maybe it took 20-30 mins too long? The game seems to strike just the right balance between personal control and unpredictability -- there is a definite amount of strategy to be used, but at the same time bad (or really good!) play from another player can really screw your plans up. The mechanics are incredibly well-suited to the theme. It is incredibly difficult to break away from the pack, and a player who does so can get exhausted pretty fast. So you have to time your escapes and then wait for the pack to catch up. Played with 4 players; this is probably best with 4-5 players. Not sure how good it is with 9, but my guess is not very much.

Best Cycling race game i ever played . If this game was produced by one off the big German firms um reifenbreite never became game of the year in 1992 . Breaking Away should have been the best game that year . Everything a games need you can find in Breaking Away . Only one minor detail is the poor material used . Have made my own homeversion with metal cyclist and an wooden gameboard . But i have an original copy as well .

I found this to be a rather enjoyable bike-racing game -- one of three that I own.  I'm not terribly sure why I own three games about bike-racing as I am not particularly into the sport -- but I digress.  I enjoy the no luck aspects in particular in relation to this game, especially the way in which players find themselves jockeying for position.  Unfortunately, I have not done to well when I've played.  Perhaps I simply put too much thought into the game.  Still, I have been trying to put a game of this together for quite a while now.  I'm also kicking around the idea of picking up the enough additional cyclists to play with 12 -- though that me be a bit much.  [06/21/2008]

The movement system is really clever, giving you a good feel for the benefit of drafting and how quickly things can go downhill if you fall behind the pack. One of the best racing games I've played and an excellent game overall.

RATING: 8
A great game that severely suffers from the length and production value.  If you can get past that this is a wonderful experience.  The game play is really quite innovative, although I may have to question whether the catch-up mechanism may be too powerful. I'd have to play it out a few more times to find out.  Perhaps there should be a cap on how many points you can earn? UPDATE: Now that I've played this again, it seems that eliminating the 4 racer with 6 or more players controls the the high drafting bonus and speeds up the game.  Still, great fun.  I can't wait to play this again.

[Fiendish Games 05 edition] {Bicycle; action-points, paper-and-pencil; optimal 4-6p} It's clearly a home-made game. It's just a paper box with ink-jet-printed cover.  The quality of the bits is below par.

Despite the quality of bits, it's an interesting, thematic and tactical game. Player interaction is strong.  The system is smart - no cards and dice but it is still dynamic. It involves many mathematic calculations but it's still fast-paced. It's happy to see that I am rewarded (get better positions) for my careful planning. I am thinking to design more courses myself.

After a few playings, I am very impressed by the innovative game design, the balance, and the fun in this game.

Also, it is a tremendous simulation of a cycling race...very impressive design.

Played once. Wow.  What a great simulation of racing.  In our race the peloton started off slow with a couple people trying to break a way but being chased down.  We had a team dropped by the peloton, but they worked together and caught up but one rider was exhausted and was eventually dropped altogether.  We had a lone cyclist attack the peloton in the final leg of the race for a long breakaway followed by a second attacker but the peloton caught one quickly and the leader just(and I mean JUST) before the finish.  Very tight race, lots of action, great simulation. Can't wait to play again.  UPDATE: worked with 4 but you probably want 5 or 6.  More players might be too much down time. 2007/11/13

Very nice game.  I enjoyed it very much.  Seems like its very tense.  Unfortunately, I think your decisions are sometimes somewhat limited and its usually pretty obvious which of the three (or four in one case) choices per biker you will make.  Rating could move up or down a bit with more plays.

RATING: 7.5
It can drag the game to a hault as people debate how many spaces to move and count them. 

I'm not sure if there's a way to plan out moves for this game. I think you just need a general idea when to store energy and when to use it. Which seems like the point of a bike race, so that's well done.

I'm astonished that Breaking Away hasn't been snapped up by a major publisher.  This is a lot of fun for such simple gameplay.  Players simply select from 3-4 speed choices per bike, per turn.  Weak short-term moves can be rewarded with extra movement points that pay out big late in the game.  Drafting and breakaways represent real-life cycling maneuvers.

Breaking Away is a favorite movie of mine - it even inspired my bicycle racer wallpaper as a youth.  The gameboard and bits look so simple.  Yet there is a lot of fun to be had playing this racing game.  I like the "drafting" mechanic and look forward to many more plays of this.

The allocation of the speed points, and the careful manipulation of the bicycles to allow them a string of lengthier sprints, makes for an interesting race game.  It's definitely better to be a part of the pack, and it's not always in your best advantage to be in first place, but can you best manage your racers to know when it's the right time to make a break for the finish line?

Seems simple, but there&#039;s a lot to consider, both from the initial values and from constant choices throughout the race, yet it&#039;s not so complicated that the game grinds down while waiting for others to move. Good stuff -- even if the components are dime store material.

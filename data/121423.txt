It hassss dice!!! Plays fast, and has a push your luck element to it. Has a good balance between luck and play time. I like it as a 15min casual time killer. Just don't expect anything exceptional.

Would be better, if the three categories of dice had different colours. Now it's hard to make a distinction between the foundation, middle tier and roof.

Nice little dice game.
Really good looking dice, but in fact very small interaction. Basically only the decision to leave dice for the next player, or to demolish an own building to prevent this...
It's ok while waiting for the last player to join the gaming night, but that's it...

A nice little diversion dice game. It would be a 5, but I like the variant of trying to build skylines of specific famous cities. If it just had one more degree of complexity to it I think I would like it quite a bit more.

A light game which plays in about 10-15 minutes and it's a lot of fun, a great intermezzo between heavier games. Rolling dice is not usually my thing, but as long as the game is so short and fun, it deserves a good rating.

The game kinda reminds me of Tower Bloxx and the components are quite nice. Nice Game :)

Looking for a deep strategy game?  If so, you've gone completely off course and ended up in very much the wrong place.  Oh sure, there is some strategy in which dice to roll and which (and when) to re-roll, but you'll not find deep strategy here.  Looking for a little Push-Your-Luck game play?  Well now you are more on track.  At its heart, this game is about lucky dice fest in the same vein as Can't Stop.  Is it thematic?  Passably, but stacked dice have about as much in common as dice do with stop signs.  Looking for a really fast filler that will pass the time and not overstay its welcome?  Well you might have found the right place after all.  Enjoy it for what it is.

Quick filler, very simple and with a lot of luck. The end conditions also sounded a bit strange, and the game ended abruptly when someone quickly finished the biggest skyscrapper. Not my kind of game, I just didn't find much going for it even for a filler.

I don't think I can speak effectively on this game.  I read later that one of the rules that I hated was actually taught wrong from the rulebook.  I don't think that would have turned my opinion too much, because the game did feel bland and uninteresting.  However, don't take my rating as definitive since it is based on the game played differently than the designer intended.

This is a cute little game. Very relaxing to play, and moves at a reasonable pace (with 2, I've never played with more). I like the solitaire variant, and overall it's a fun diversion. The first 2 turns are fairly repetitive: roll bottoms with all your dice. After that you have good decisions to make. I got this cheap ($5 used) and it is well worth it.

This game was quick although it did take a bit of explination to ge the rules down completly.

It was fun although from our experiance the person who wins is the person who completes a 6 story building and ends the game first though.

A dice game less strategic than Yahtzee, which is not a compliment. At least it's short.

Another in a long line of dice rolling fillers, which I typically really enjoy, but this one just wasn't all that interesting unfortunately.

On your turn, you'll typically get 3 dice.  You roll them and must use at least one of them, then re-roll, using at least one of them, etc etc until you're either out of dice or just don't want to risk rolling again.  You can either:

a) add dice to your towers
b) punt a die to a pool of dice that subsequent players can pick up, allowing them more than the standard 3 dice per turn.
c) punt a die, but also demolish one of your buildings, hurting yourself a little but also not giving an extra die to an opponent.

When you finish buildings, you turn in the dice for tiles that are worth points depending on the height of the building you made.

The game ends after 9 rounds, or at the end of the round in which at least one player creates the tallest possible building (which seems to be a terribly bad rule; it's not that difficult to do, and totally hoses the start player since he has to guess whether someone else is going to end the game or not).  

If I played again, I would just play 9 rounds and forget about the alternate end game condition, but to be honest the game isn't interesting or fun enough to pull out again.

Overall, very very good production quality and a boatload of custom dice, but the game you play with them falls flat.

Fun dice game that can be played in 10 minutes solo. Highest score so far is 66, the demolish action really hurts if you are trying to build a big building and have to get rid of it because of a busted roll. 

The dice are great and not stickered which is excellent, although I do wish the different building levels were a little easier to tell apart. The middle level dice also includes the top for the low-rise buildings and the base is a little hard to tell apart as it is a thin line. After a few plays I got use to picking up the dice I wanted.

Not a bad filler. The only real flaw is that high-scoring orange buildings are very hard to complete unless you start one early and manage to keep it going, which means that if one player starts to pull ahead, it can be almost impossible to catch up toward the end of the game. Of course, this can easily be house-ruled by playing to a target score instead of 9 rounds.

On the plus side, there are some simple decision points, the components are neat, and the whole game takes only 10 minutes.

On a whole I like dice games. I like chucking dice and see what happens. I like the inherent lightness of the rules. And this game does have you chucking dice and it isn't complex, but here I think it goes a bit too far in the light direction but to be honest I don't remember why. It's been months since I've played compared to when I'm writing this and the game is utterly forgettable. I picked it up because it was cheap and I like dice games, but really I wish I left it on the shelf. Maybe when all the planets are aligned it'll work really well but until then there are so many other dice games I'd rather play.

Skyline's biggest strengths are its speed and simplicity. I found it engaging for such a simple premise.

Decisions are made with each dice roll. You can create very limited plans depending on which buildings are still incomplete and choose your dice accordingly.

I found it enjoyable. My wife was ambivalent. It is fun for a few games but is definitely 'filler'.

[floatright][size=5]2013-11-27[/size][/floatright]A quick and light town-building dice game.

[u]Overview[/u]
Players roll dice to construct low-rises (1-2 floors), mid-rises (2-4 floors) and high-rises (3-6 floors). There are three kinds of dice: ground floor, upper floor and penthouse, and each has 3 low-rise, 2 mid-rise and 1 high-rise faces (with one exception: low-rises have no penthouse, so 3 sides of the penthouse die are blank). On their turn, players choose three dice (or take all the abandoned dice) and roll them. After a roll, at least one die must be either built, abandoned (so that the opponent can take it) or demolished (discarding a partial or complete building), then the player can reroll the remaining dice until none are left.
Mid- and high-rises are complete once a penthouse is placed. A game ends after 9 turns or at the end of the turn in which a 6 floor high-rise is completed. At the end of the game every completed building is worth as many points as the square of its height.

[u]Strategy and comments[/u]
Always start with 3 ground floors and try to end the first turn with 1 high-rise ground floor (you don't need more) and remember to expand and build more ground floors as you start filling up your low- and mid-rises. High-rises are push-your-luck buildings: they give lots of points but it's hard to build them and to complete them, so you risk investing a lot with no return because the game ends before you get that penthouse built. It is very important to be flexible and have somewhere to place what you roll, however bad it is (or to have extra ground floors to demolish to deny dice to your opponent). Extra dice can give you a big boost, especially in two-player games, so take the abandoned dice; it's not always the best choice, though: in the last turn you might have higher chances of scoring well with three penthouses.

[floatright][size=5]2014-12-12[/size][/floatright]The game is quite elegant in its minimality, but for me it's too luck dependant, too bland and the set-up rules are terribly unbalanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Skyline is a very quick, light dice game where dice are used to build towers of varying types and heights to gain victory points.  With a few different dice types to choose from, and the ability to roll dice in a common pool if they look interesting, there are a few more interesting decisions to make than in an almost brain-dead game like Martian Dice. This is perfect as a 15-minute filler for those rushed lunch breaks.

Skyline is a very light dice game. You throw 3 dice each turn that you can select from a pool (bases, middle parts, rooftops) and try to construct skyscrapers with the results. There is some luck to push where you need to either demolish one of your own buildings or increase the number of dice for the next player if things go wrong.

The sticking point with a lot of Yahtzee-style dice fillers is how much of an emotional wall you run into if the dice Just Don't Roll what you want. Or, I guess, how much the game encourages you to roll and hope rather than coming up with a new plan. This isn't really fun enough for that adaptation to happen.

Quick little dice game, with a bit of strategy regarding dice to roll, this definitely offers more than another yahtzee, but has the same kind of push your luck fun.

The game is basically three kinds of dice (Foundations, Midfloors, Penthouses), with three different colors representing three height ranges of buildings.

As dice colors match lower sections they can be kept and build up to various levels by color. When a building is complete the dice are surrendered for a VP token equalling the square of the dice involved, e.g. 3 stories x3 = 9VP.

Of course the tallest buildings score the most points, but is it the right time to go for a six-story building and end the game, or should you stake out some mid-range buildings, or even set out a bunch of foundations to build on?

This is a nice little custom dice game, overall- definitely a family-friendly offering where everyone builds and gathers points, and very little player interaction otherwise, except for the possibility of early game end.

Nice little dice game in which you are rolling dice that represent the Ground, middle and Top floors of skyscrapers in 3 different colours.  The different colours can be built to differing heights, and you get exponentially more points the higher your skyscrapers go.

Unfortunately, although this game is fun and simple to play, it's incredibly limited in depth.  I can't imagine wanting to play more than 2 or 3 games of this as every game would be basically the same.  Not a terrible game, just not one I would consider worth buying.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (February 2016)

Skyline is a fast game, and that´s its main strength and appeal. I really dislike this game.

The rules are pretty easy, you can explain them under 4 minutes. The game components are nice, but the dice should have had more differentiation between the kind of floor. The playtime is very short (mercifully). It is pure luck, the decisions are pretty obvious. You roll well and win or roll bad and lose. There are almost no meaningful decisions and a player who gets a high number of abandoned dice has a lot more chances at winning, but this is also pure luck.

I generally dislike this kind of game, but some friends liked it, still, if I’m going to play a chucking dice game, there are lots of better options.

Bottom line, I hope I never have to play the game again, but if I do, it is only because its playtime is very short. It´s obvious and a luck fest. I already got rid of my copy. It is way too simple for my current tastes.

I'll be honest, when we first started it, it was a bit confusing.  However, as we continued to play, we really got a hang of it and started having a really fun time building our high rises.  I like the idea of being able to choose your dice, if you pick from the construction site, as well as having to either abandon dice (thus giving the next player more dice) or deconstructing part of your building to place the dice back into the construction yard.  It's a quick and enjoyable filler!

RATING: 6.5
Tried this on Yucata. I really enjoy this filler dice game, about constructing skyscrapers. Yucata's got a nice implementation, with each building looking unique.

Update: after 6 plays, downgrading from 7.2 to 6.5.  Mostly because I have realized that it has a major Puerto-Rico type seat position/experience disadvantage.
If one player keeps abandoning a ton of dice, the player to their left will easily win.

Even for a light short game, this is a big flaw.  Not sure how to remedy it.  Maybe by alternating turn-order somehow, periodically.  Or, bidding with victory points on the Abandoned District dice, so everyone gets a shot at them.

I originally had this rated at 7, I played it on Yucata and it seemed a nice simple dice rolling game, after purchasing the game and playing face-to-face I have found this to be a most unexciting and shallow game, it is very luck based as you would expect from a dice rolling game but there is not enough rolling or options to mitigate the luck, in addition it does not stand up to repeated plays.

It would be an interesting dice building game but I do not really like the first player disadvantage along with the last player advantage.  I would prefer more of a fun factor in my dice-rolling filler games.  (Having a static three dice to roll unless the previous player makes bad choices doesn't really do it for me.)

I was really disappointed with this game. My expectations weren't particularly high considering it's low BGG rating. However, it did not even meet my moderate expectations. 

The Good: 
-Quick Game--2 player takes about 15 minutes 
-Accessible--Can be taught in less than 5 minutes
-Decent component quality (dice feel small, but cardboard pieces are nice).

The Bad: 
-Lack of balance. By that I mean it is too luck-driven.
-Your choices aren't very "meaningful." To be sure, this is a light game. It's also a dice game, which means randomness will be on the high side. However, that should not preclude it from providing various options based on your strategy. Instead, this game offers only 1 obvious option (abandon). Choosing to demolish guarantees a point loss (typically 4 points), but giving an extra die to another player does not guarantee that he/she will profit at least 4. If anything, it would be most detrimental to provide the other player with an extra dice in a 2 player game, since it's zero-sum. Yet, it's still not a good option, because again it guarantees points rather than leaving it to chance. 

My wife and I tried to "fix" the game (never a good sign) by trying to make the demolish option more attractive. We tried 3 different options, and none worked. In short, if you want to play this game with kids, or you are an architect/engineer and think it's a cute theme, but don't care about gameplay, then I say go for it. If you are anybody else (including just an old-fashioned dice fan), skip this one!

Fantastic dice game.

This definitely jumps right in there with Incan Gold, For Sale, and Coloretto as games I enjoy introducing groups of new gamers to.

Clever little dice rolling gme that is played in a quanter hour.  A bit of the Yahtzee mold, where the choices are basically in which dice to roll, and then you roll until you cannot roll any more.

RATING: 5
Choose a combination of 3 dice from 3 different pools - bases, floors, tops - and hope to roll well, trying to first get bases in the top scoring colour (orange, also the hardest to get as you'd expect, and then blue) and then in subsequent rolls adding floors to it and then scoring it by eventually rolling a top. The score is the number of floors squared. So the main issue with the game is that there's absolutely no point settling for anything less than 4, 5 or 6 floors, as they'll win the game, settling for less only when the dice force you (as you must keep one each roll). The game ends on the round when someone gets a 6 high building, so if you're the first player and you miss out on it, if anyone else gets it that turn, you miss out on 36 points and lose. A total crap-shoot with little to think about. Made worse by the dice components which are hard to distinguish and get back in the right pools - why not different colours, or sizes or dramatically different pictures. It didn't go too long so it wasn't a total loss, but it didn't meet the mark beating out other games competing for this time slot.

This is a dice-rolling game where you're trying to build skyscrapers--the sides of the dice have building bottoms, middles, and tops printed on them, of three different building sizes.  You want to complete the biggest buildings you can before the game ends, so you're trying to roll specific building parts based on what you've already built.  I'm not terribly fond of dice-rolling games, and this one didn't really stand out in my mind.

A nice variant of the Yahtzee theme: roll some dice, use some, re-roll the remainder. The twist here is that you can "abandon" unusable dice, in order to keep rolling the rest, at the risk of an opponent getting to use your abandoned dice. Doesn't take much space: this was a good "sofa game" for when my wife was recovering from knee surgery.

Three Player Value = Fair


Skyline is a simple and quick playing dice game. Nothing else. For me, that is a good reason to like it. Quick and easy games certainly have their place and this is good one.

This game is very straight forward. Roll dice. Push your luck. Play 9 rounds. Done. 

The dice represent floors of high-rise buildings. Players are trying to build to most and tallest buildings. 

The dice are very cool custom dice with parts of buildings on them that look like foundations, floors and roofs. And them in ascending order to build.

What little theme there is fits well into the game.

The game is multi-player solitaire with the only interaction between players being lost dice.


Pros - 
- Easy to teach and learn
- Quick play


Cons - 
- No real player interaction and lack of strategy puts many people off

A clever dice rolling game where the three different types of dice form parts of a skyscraper. The game has a push your luck type of mechanic where the best play involves going for broke. Strangely all the dice look so much the same that it is a bit hard to distinguish them from one another.

There's not very much of a game here, but it's over in ten minutes and you get to roll a lot of dice, so... that's fun. Simple, but perhaps a bit too simple. You've got up to nine turns, so you build your bases up in the early rounds and try and complete the big ones before the end. You'll either roll what you need or you won't. The temptation is whether you take three dice of your choice (bases, mostly mid sections or penthouses), or perhaps more dice from the failure pile. When things go wrong you have to decide whether to tear down one of your incomplete buildings along with a die to the general construction stock, or give the following player another die to the reject pile (from which they have the option to choose). It's not much of a decision and the reject pile usually fills up with penthouses fairly quickly.

Not bad for something to pass the time. Production wise the game would flow better if three dice sizes had been used.

Played once with 3P. This dice game is really light, and centers around a simple, yet workable mechanism of constructing floors of buildings. There's an element of push-your-luck, and there are some valid decisions to be made concerning which dice to roll. It would have been nice if the dice were slightly chunkier. Overall, a pleasant, if not forgettable, filler dice game.

Quick dice-rolling game that is a great in-between game that is light and fast. Plays out in around 30 mins. Some elements of strategy and of course quite a bit of luck but it's designed well.

Online (Yucata) play only

Update: after many more plays, I'm finding this less interesting. The choices seem to be pretty obvious and there really isn't much to think about here, even considering that this is just a light filler.

A decent little push-your-luck, set-collection, dice-rolling filler game. Plays very quickly. It's more comparable to Zombie/Martian Dice, although a bit thinkier (but still a filler), than to games like To Court the King and Roll through the Ages, which are somewhat deeper and take longer to play. There are a few cool little twists here:
- like Zombie Dice, you get to choose dice at the start of your turn; here, though, it's not totally random ... nice change! There's a decision to make, albeit not a terribly difficult one.
- having an Abandoned dice pool is clever: do you demolish one of your buildings, or give the next player the opportunity to take an extra die? At the same time, you have to set yourself up to take advantage of whatever may end up in the pool.
- on your turn, after each roll of the dice, you only have to spend one of them (although you can use more). That's a nice change from other games of this type. It adds another decision point during your turn: should you reroll a die hoping for what you want, or keep it to use later so you can reroll that other die twice? This is basically what you see in the heavier game, TCtK: e.g., you have a guaranteed 6; roll your dice, and if you don't get any 6s you can use the Bishop to put your 6 into play, bank it, and reroll the rest.

--- Rules Summary --
There are 3 types of dice: ground floor, upper floor, penthouse. Each die has 1 orange face, 2 blue, and 3 purple (except penthouse: blank instead of purple). Players may start the game with one ground floor die (based on turn order). At the start of the game, place one of each die in the Abandoned Buildings area.

On your turn:
1. Take any 3 dice from the pool, or all the Abandoned dice
2. Roll your dice
3. Take one action, either:
- Build: add any dice to your skyline
... Ground Floors needed to start building, then Upper Floors; blue and orange buildings are finished by capping with Penthouse
... purple may only be 1-2 tall; blue 2-4; orange 3-6
- Abandon: add a die to the Abandoned pool
- Demolish: return one die plus incomplete building to Supply
4. If any dice remain, go back to 2

Game ends after 9 rounds, or at end of the round during which any player built a 6-orange building. Every COMPLETE building earns VP = height squared. Most VP wins.

RATING: 3
This is a filler dice rolling game where players take dice of 3 different types in order to build towers of up to 3 different heights.  It's the standard Yahtzee mechanic where after each roll you have to make a decision with at least one of the dice and then you can re-roll.  It just goes around the table like this until one player is lucky enough to get to the end-game point total.  Completely lucky and not very entertaining.

This is a relatively simple press your luck dice game with some interesting choices. The game looks very pretty but takes up more space and has a lot more bits than I would like for what should be a portable 20 minute game (too much space to play at a restaurant). The game seems to play best with 2-3 people. I'd still prefer Zombie Dice over this, but I'd prefer this over Martian Dice or Can't Stop. Each of these would fall entirely to personal preferences as I've seen opinions all over the place on which games are preferred.

[thing=121423][/thing] is a light dice game in wich you want to make the tallest buildings and, thus, have the best skyline of all the players.

Basically [thing=121423][/thing] is a set collection type of game. In your turn you choose dice from two places: from the Construction Yard or from the Abandoned District. If you choose the Construction Yard, you pick three dice from three options: the ground floor dice, the upper floor dice or the penthouse dice. You can pick three in any way you want (like, two penthouse dice and one upper floor). If you choose the Abandoned District, you roll all the dice that are there.

After you roll you will have three choices:
- Build (use one or more dice to start a building or to make one bigger);
- Abandon (move one or more dice to the Abandoned District);
- Demolish (you send one of the your rolled dice away, but also must destroy one of your buildings, be it complete or still as a row of dice) - you will use this action to prevent the Abandoned District to became way too attractive for the other players.

After the choice of one or more of the three above, the player can roll the unused dice again, and will be able to choose one or more of the actions again. The player do this until no more dice are avaiable - then the player must pass/resign.

There are three types of buildings:
- the Low-Rise (has a maximum height of 2, a minimum height of 1, and does not need a Penthouse die to be complete) - are worth between 1 to 4 points;
- the Mid-Rise (has a maximum height of 4, a minimum height of 2, and must have a Penthouse die to be complete) - are worth between 4 to 16 points;
- the High-Rise (has a maximum height of 6, a minimum height 3, and must have a Penthouse die to be complete) - are worth between 9 to 36 points.

The game ends by the end of the 9th round, or in the round when someone build a High-Rise building with the maximum height (6). The winner will be the player with the most points.

[thing=121423][/thing] might be way more fun to play live, but since my plays all came from Yucata, I can't vouch for this. I found the game obvious and quick, with an easy set of choices and, of course, a great deal of luck involved - which I don't mind. The interaction between players are tiny, basically only coming from the Abandoned District, since the die up put there can be used by other players.

How this compares to [thing=37380][/thing] and [thing=70323][/thing]? Not favorable. You have less interaction and choices in [thing=121423][/thing] than in [thing=37380][/thing] - this one have pestilence, everyone building the same monuments, religion/revolt, and the set of decisions is richer. You do have more a little more meat in the bones of [thing=121423][/thing] than in [thing=70323][/thing], but the interaction factor is way, way down, which makes the experience of playing [thing=70323][/thing] a better one for me.

So far only played this with two, but for a simple push your luck dice game (with great dice btw) I like it a lot. Unlike Martian Dice, this game actually plays fast, and the the 9 turn limit ensures that it never outstays its welcome. Glad to own it as a quick 15 minute filler. My girlfriend likes it too!

Sort of like Can't Stop, but different.  Initial rating.  Certainly a nice filler, not sure yet if it's a keeper.

Edit:  Still on the fence about my rating/keeping the game.  However, I do think the game is underrated and I think it's due in part to the fact that it was given out as a KS extra for Ground Floor, a much deeper and longer game.  As a result, Skyline was rated by lots of people who might not really care for the chaos of dice games.  Also, this game is currently ranked worse than Blueprints even though it's clearly less chaotic and a deeper game.

RATING: 5
First of all, we made some pretty serious errors in our first game.  We weren't playing the Abandoned Yard correctly (we were refilling it AS SOON AS it emptied, not at the end of a player's turn), and we didn't play the way you discarded unused dice correctly (those went to the Abandoned Yard instead of back into Construction).  So I won't pass complete judgment on the game without giving it another chance, but I've seen enough of the game to think that there's not a lot here.  It's just a lot of the same, with no real narrative building over the course of the game.  It's not bad, but it's not great, either.

Very light weight.
Low player interaction.
Low-medium theme application.

Pleasant, extroverts will amp it, but otherwise a good starter, cool-down or filler/impromptu game.

This is still a nice game for beginners or when you want an almost stressless play session, but now that [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140933/blueprints]Blueprints[/url] is out, that's the game you want to play with folks wanting something a bit meatier, which it is and in spades. Great game that.

It's a finite and hence minimal-downtime push-your-luck game with very nice dice.  This plays well as a solitaire — in fact, there's not a whole lot of reason (beyond social ones) to play it with others, except that it adds the dynamic of the Abandoned materials.  On your turn, you get either 3 dice (of your choice) or all the abandoned dice, and roll them, building, demolishing, or (with more than one player) abandoning one or more after each roll.  Gambling hard and/or (more likely) poor rolls can lead to a lot of frustrating recidivation, but this is a pretty pure dice game.  Your choices are simple (but interesting), so turns go quickly, and the game goes quickly.  After a bad game, you can shelve it, or spend another 15 minutes or so trying it again.

Bonus:  The solitaire rules not only give you point-based rankings, but also provide goals you can try to achieve, just to make the game more interesting in this world of achievements in video games, which push you to replay numerous times, trying very strange things, and really experiencing the game more fully.  I wish more boardgames had this aspect.  [i](My extreme enjoyment of [thing=25554][/thing] is ongoing, because it's pretty easy to create goals like that for yourself in the game, but less easy to find satisfaction with them while contending with the draft choices and other leftovers from your opponents, as well as the whim of the rats/characters.)[/i]

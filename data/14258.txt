This game had potential.  There are just too many spaces.  No retreats in addition to lighting strikes with boats/choppers, and a mercifull economic victory rule can make for a mercifully short, if unfufilling game however.

Love this game, even if it isn't that great.  Our biggest problem was with three people playing, we tended to camp, which led to massive battles to no purpose.  Maybe with more people there might be more small scale conflicts?

It takes about three playings to figure this one out.  The mechanics are simple, but the strategy behind the game is tricky.  It does suffer from analysis paralysis because of this.

We had a lot of fun with this one. I loved the bits and the theme. Maybe not the most streamlined, but fun for sure if you are into area control/guys on a map style game. More interesting that Axis and Allies, to me. Some great features, such as ransoming family members, building illegal businesses, and cool bits like limos, boats and choppers.

i actually find the oft-maligned art on this one endearing.  i really wanted to like the game, but it just didn't work.  profound downtime between turns, imbalanced starting positions, kludgy vehicle movement.  to me, none of the game's mechanics seemed to work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Cool bits but only a so-so game.  It has theme but the mechanics are not tightly integrated with that theme.  There is player elimination but it doesn't always happen - only if players gang up enough to know a person out.  The game will take some time to complete, so expect a longer game.  There is a crowd that likely is keen on this style of game, but I am not part of it.

Tentative rating after one play. Surprisingly quick and light, not at all what I was expecting, but a lot of fun. Escalating levels of violence with plenty of dice rolling to resolve combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice addition to the A&A-clones of games. A bit basic, but still enough options to keep it interesting. An expansion perhaps? It drips with theme and the rules are well written, as an experienced player of these kind of games I had no trouble at all explaining the rules after 1 reading. Extremly high production values.

It will get table time and probably replace some older similiar games (Shogun, Risk, A&A (already discarded due to Attack!).

RATING: 7.8
My greatest guilty pleasure. A game that rewards brutal and swift action by its players (and therefore perfectly emulates its theme). Godfather impressions with a mouth full of boiled sweet are a requisite. Get friends together for this and have a blast.

RATING: 7
Mixed feelings in our group - half liked it (myself included) and half were indifferent to it. There is a lot of downtime until its your turn again - especially in a 5/6 player game. The bosses are surprisingly vulnerable to a quick limo/hitman strike team which wiped out one of our players on about turn 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
My group played a few games of this, each of which leaned heavily toward one player early in the game and never stopped tilting in their favor. That didn't stop it from being fun, but either bad play or an unbalanced game (I suspect the former) caused us to put Blood Feud on the shelf for a while.

Scratches the A&A itch.  Dig the theme.  

Update 8/09 - Played with five.  Fun, tricky game that still scratches the A&A itch.  Got to be agressive if you want to win, but you got to make certain you don't leave yourself in bad shape.  Dropped to a six as I still like it, but it would only come out when you want to play a game like this.  Player elimination would have had me sitting for hours.

RATING: 5
Solid title by Eagle. Have heard this compared to Axis and Allies, but it felt a little more like Samurai Swords to me. I like that players have the opportunity to infiltrate gangland frontiers to raid choice targets. Strong, thematic production marred only by the point-tabulating folks engage in towards the end-- which tends to increase downtime.

At first, I thought this was going to be a more interesting Risk clone, but then I played it.  Takeovers are fun, and really spice things up, but everywhere we looked there were rules that just felt horribly wrong.  

Universal supply limit in particular killed it for our group.  It meant guys later in turn order couldn't buy good units, even though they had the cash.

In the end, we expected good things, but were incredibly disappointed.  Someone would have to be incredibly intent on playing this game for me to ever try it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is the sort of game that you want a lot of players for, otherwise it will be horribly unbalanced.  It is a game where you capture land to get money, and use the money to buy pieces.  However, there are so many money bonuses, that players are often dealing with more money than they need, leading to long game time and confusion.  But, get the right group of players, and it's fun.

Another Risk variant.  The victory conditions need to to be cut back somewhat in order to shorten the play time.  Most enjoyable still,.

RATING: N/A
Bought it for the plastic figures.
Gameplay is old school dudes on a map.  Looks like it probably has a severe rich get richer problem because your money is primarily determined by how many family members you have in different districts.  If you lose family members, you lose earning potential, and your ability to buy dudes decreases.  It's a spiral downward from there.
Never got to play it - traded away.

An old-school strategy game that provided for some tense conflicts weighed down with extraneous mechanics and complexity native to its time.  

Plays out like a war game where you're controlling thugs trying to conquer areas of New York.  Territories generate income according to a chart which you spend to buy more thugs.  Also had some interesting vehicle rules allowing for some more protracted strikes.  

I've had some fun playing this but it's nothing special and I don't regret my buddy selling it a few years ago.

Finally got it on the table and I must say I was surprised by its depth.  With all the way your opponents can cut through your lines (limos, helicopters, speedboats) you really need to think about what to buy and how to protect your mob boss. 

My main problem with the game is that with all the mobility, and player elimination, it might be an early night for a careless or unlucky player.

Completely unoriginal, uninspired, and unintersting game fatally wounded by poor rules, HIDEOUS components, and absolutely grotesque artwork.  My group universally panned the game, and we're all big fans of the Gamemaster games which this is a very bad imitation of.  We despised the resource system (which the box claims is somehow innovative, yet it's just another "rich get richer" setup based on territorial control), we didn't like seeing the same old combat mechanics yet again, and we in particular didn't see the point in even bothering with a second victory condition (make $6000 on a turn) when eliminating other players is so much easier.  Everything about this game is amateurish and has the appearance of that "dream game" you imagined when you were 11 years old and naive about game design, right down to the simple fact that there's not really enough pieces to play it with 5 or 6 players.  There is literally no reason to play this game when you could play any of the Risk or A&A variants.  Don't be tricked by the theme, it doesn't mean anything despite the superfluous claim the box makes that you can "flesh out your family" by playing different types of organized crime.   Bootleggers was so well done...why Eagle, why?

One play.  This is a classic Dice & Combat game in the traditional American/MB Gamemaster style.  The theme is unique and very heavily supported.  The board and the pieces are beautiful and there's just something about fighting out a gang war on a map of NYC that is just cool.  I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the limited units and the purchasing at the end of the round, though.  All theme no game.

This game dissapointed my regulars. We were all keen to play, but found it dragged with too much down-time, and in the end the rules for eliminating other players left us with a clear runaway leader.

RATING: 8
A good game.  ALMOST a great game.  Blood Feud is another of those games that does what I love MOST in a good Ameritrash game- evokes the FEEL of being in charge of criminal family.  Yes, its a last man standing game- but usually when someone get's 'whacked' out of the game, you're coming into the end game anyway.  Yes, some of the rules are a bit vague (the rules on boats and how they effect the movement of other watercraft could be better). Yes, yes yes.  But at its heart, this game FEELS like a street fight. No zones of control- just hop in your limo with some hoods and go WHACK that guy.  What this game REALLY needs, though, is some way to 'customize' your gang.  Some way of differentiating between "Yakuza", "Italian Goombas", "Chinese Tong", "Irish Mob", "Jewish Gangs"- etc- would have been great.  That said, this game is highly recommended for someone looking for an Axis and Allies game that is DIFFERENT.

RATING: 5
Great themed game if you have the time and enough players.  Probably better with more players as there is lots of hustling for territory and quite a bit of negotiation factors.  Includes excellent buildings and vehicles to aid you in your quest for control of the Big Apple.  
Like other games of this genre, it suffers from possible early player elimination and very long playing time.  Furthermore, there's the unbalance issue--if players gang up on another player, that player won't stand a chance.
If you enjoy big Ameritrash games, you'll enjoy this one.  Not bad to play once in a while.  The enjoyment factor really depends on the gaming group.

Despite my antipathy towards games in which dices decide the outcome of a battle, I bought this one. It was the theme that sucked me in. I´m really looking forward to play it. I´ll update my rating and this comment afterwards.

[2006-06-03]
A short update and a temporary rating after my first game yesterday:

All in all this game is fun. We´ll see what I´ll think about BFINY after a few more games. Until then here is a short list with some things I liked and some that I disliked:

+ The theme is great. You do feel like a mobster trying to take over a whole city.
+ The bits are great although the board can become a little crowded during the endgame.        Maybe a little smaller figures or some counters would have been nice.
+ Tension is quite high during the game. You can't feel safe anywhere on the map.
+ Aggressive play seems to get rewarded. I like this. :)

- The endgame seemed a bit too long. After about two and a half hours it was quite clear that I'd win but it took me another 90 minutes to wipe out my enemies. I guess, they didn't have too much fun during that time. Perhaps we'll get faster after a few more plays. I'll have to see.
- The overall play-time seems a bit long.

Until I've got a few more games under my belt, I'll give Blood Feud In New York 7 points.

RATING: 8.5
The theme and components are amazing.  A lot going on here.  The tension with the economy and independent family members vs. safety of family members is nice.  In mid- to late-game once transportation is well developed you must risk your family members.  You need to understand the rules and movement very well to protect your boss from surprise attack and elimination.  Very cool game.  A negative for some people is that this is a longer game (around 3 hours) and an elimination game where a player can exit early.  Indeed, elimination is strongly encouraged and the eliminating player is well rewarded.  These are not negatives to me as the elimination aspect increases the stakes of the game and I would prefer to play this over playing two other good games.  One thing that really helps speed this along is to have a calculator at the ready to calculate income and the subtract spending so as to avoid a lot of the paper money exchange (as most income gets spent immediately anyway).  Very different play than A&A and any comparisons to A&A relate only to the battle resolution mechanism.  The strategy and objectives very different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is one of Eagle's best effort to date .  It was a hoot from start to finish.  The theme rings true and it borrows the right things from the A&A system while throwing in enough new mechanics to make it unique.  Congrats Eagle games it looks like you are on the right track!

RATING: 7
Fun game but holy moley it can drag out. First game with 4 players was at almost 5 hours and I was at $5880 in earning. There were 3 players left. Myself with the entire southern half of New York, another player with the entire northern half of New York, and the third player with Jersey. The northern player and I decided to take out the Jersey player and then split New York in a partnership agreement to call it a night.

I really like the theme and the combat portion works smoothly after a round or 2. As is usual with these type of games, the count and math process at the end of each players turn is a bit tedious but it's all part of it...  The bits could have been a bit smaller to make better use of the HUGE map and save some crowding. Later in the game we took to designating an area off board for players to place all there newly bought resources until moving them next round due to space constraint.

RATING: 6
auction win arrived on 8-1-07. This game gets high marks for quality of the bits. Reminiscent of Axis & Allies or Risk type of games. Being able to be elliminated lessens value of game for me. So I think 6.0 is appropriate.

This here is "Ameritrash", no ifs and or buts. Tons of plastic figs lots of dice rolling and ... dun ... dun ... DUN ... PLAYER ELIMINATION!

AT at its finest. Lots of plastic, lots of stuff to do each turn, little to no way to keep track of everything easily, bad power imbalance once someone starts taking losses, and a long downward slide to the eventual win by the person who avoided being involved in early skirmishes. Fun, but I'm afraid it goes on much longer than the enjoyment does...

Changed rating from 1.5 to 3.

This game is a worse ripoff of Axis and Allies.  The map was wonky and the units uninteresting.  I don't remember much else since I bought and played this over 10 years ago before I really knew about games.  Maybe if I hold onto it long enough it will become valuable someday?  But it is at least a workable game that I can foresee being  convinced to play.  It would have to be pretty extreme circumstances, but it deserves better than a 1.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As a two player, I rate this game a 5 because it quickly becomes one sides. If you start at Queens, you will win if you use movement properly. The theme and concept is very original. There is not too much of a focus in combat but movement. And if it takes $6000 to win, why in the hell only have $100s. I didn't know I won until we ran out of money and I had most of it. 

For a three player game, the rating is a 7. There are very tense moments in the game when you utilize all the things you are able to do in the game like buy crack houses, boats, helicopters, and more hitmen. You can kidnap and bribe other players for their family members, which is the best way to make a fun and tense game.

This is a GREAT "war" game! Components are awesome! (There are cool boats, limos, helos with "working" blades, buildings, thugs, hitmen...you name it!) Some rules issues were a bit confusing at first but Kyle W. (designer) was quick to explain any issues! There is a lot going on in this one: Do I build a gaming hall to add to my assets? Do I pick up the boys and go for a ride in the limo? Or would it be faster in a speed boat or helo? Do I hire a hitman to take out any "loose" ends? Only you (as the Mob Boss) can make that call! This is your district! This is "BLOOD FUED in NY".....where bashing heads and kidnapping is essential!

The best Risk variant since 2210 AD. Quality components, easy to learn but rules unclear in parts. Fun theme. The vehicle rules allow for extreme mobility that no other Risk variant offers; you can jump behind enemy lines and really shake things up! Talked with designer and he is a great guy, quick to answer questions. Recommended!

This ain't a bad game. Not as seamy as Illuminati Crime Lords, and thus more tolerable. I'd play it again if somebody asked me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Ideal Players: 5-6

Description: Play a crime family trying to take over The Big Apple. 

Pro: Corrupt police stations, brothels, and hitmen bring the theme to life. Great coloring for the bits (easy to distinguish). Fantastic bits in general.

Con: Has some messy math for income. Lots of dice rolling and direct conflict. The penthouse bits could be better.

The game pieces are very cool and the game is pretty good.  Ok, truthfully the gold, silver and bronze pieces are a very good idea, but they're a little odd looking and it does get a little confusing when there are large gangs next to one another. Nothing to cry about but I can easily see future arguments over it. The games very much reminds me of Axis & allies.

After several plays, WOW! What a big heavy box filled with plastic goodness. It really reminds me of the MB Gamemasters series, (Shogun and Axis & Allies) only updated. There is a lot going on in the game it seemed like we had no downtime, we all were planning our Mobs attacks and defenses. A very original wargame with awesome bits and strategy. I definitely feel like we are in the Sopranos while playing and will even speak accordingly during play :Let me make you an offer you cant refuse:  The board is great especially if you visit, live or have lived in NYC or even just want to get familiar with NYC, its a better map than many actual road maps Ive seen.  To sum it up the theme and components are spectacular and the game play is a blast!

Beautiful board, game play is ok if your into kicking your opponents ass, or on the other hand getting your ass kicked - like I did the first time I played.  Would like to maybe retry - played one time with 3 players, maybe more fun with 4-5 players.  Board can became easily cluttered and your pieces hard to distiguish from other players pieces.

RATING: 6
Feels like it was *so close* to being as awesome as the production would lead you to believe. The pieces are tremendous--even the corrupt precinct markers, which are bizarre looking (not a design I ever could have conceived). 

Features player elimination, which I was the first to experience in the game I played. This could often lead to a snowball effect if the player who whacks an opponent first is able to gobble up their territory--but other mobsters can band together to keep the giant in check. As with any elimination game, just watch your back. The vehicles and movement of the more powerful hitman pieces allow for some very sudden strikes from a good distance away. It's really easy to lose a family member quickly, or even have your boss wiped out and be left on the sidelines.

played this game a lot and it just takes way too long between turns. the concept is great and gives a good mafia feel!! The round turn time is way too long and the money system takes too much time to calculate. all in all the game has a great theme (i love the helicopters, hitmen, and other mafia ties) but is slowly played has a poor money system, and is a bad player will be leaving the table early.

I LOVE this game!!!  It's one of the best modern mob war games out there.  The combat is like A & A but all the other elements make it work.  I don't care what anyone sez 'bout this game--it rocks!  My dad turned me on to history of the mafia & to play this game with the knowledge of how the mob works goes in your favor.  You HAVE to be ruthless!  You just can't be the nice guy at all or you're gonna loose!  It's just that simple.  I've won every game I've played--yes, this earns me bragging rights!

Throw a little "Axis and Allies" in with a little "Conquest of the Empire" add a gangster theme and you have "Blood Fued In New York". This game is fast and furious and can make enemies of your closest friends {or your son}.

Plays a little like Axis and Allies except that players can make lightning strikes deep into enemy territory so it is not a game of massing armies on fronts. It is an elimination game and once a player starts lossing their family members the game will quickly go downhill for them. It does mean that the game can play very quickly.

Player elimination.

[b]My thoughts[/b]: This game creates fun and tense situations with mobs facing off with each other, protecting your family members and Boss!! Strategy and Tactics are key to winning and beat out a strong manpower hands down.  Tons of ways to go about winning, but most important is getting cash--should be every players priority number 1. Another unique system and theme, tough to come out on top strategically and economically. Fun when you're ahead, hard to come back from though when you don't have the dough, the first few turns are crucial in this game.

This is a good game.  When we first pulled it out, I was thinking a pretty straight forward Risk/Axis type of game, but it has some really interesting mechanics.  If you play it for the first time, make sure you have a good understanding of the structures/vehicles that you can buy in this game.  A large grouping of units on a given spot will do nothing for you if they can all get into a car and drive right past them.  :)

I think the game needs to be shorter for what it is.  The rules as is, makes for a highly potential degressive game and there isn't any mechanism that makes it progressive enough to end or climax for a shorter game.  BF can last the whole day if one or more players choose a defensive scheme.  One way to make it more progressive is to change the corruption markers and rules relating to it.  Although the theme is good, b/c of it's similar combat rules, I would easily prefer to play Axis & Allies.  There are other mob/gangster theme games I like much much better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Beautiful components but just not the game I was hoping for it to be.  Too much downtime between turns and quite a mathematical exercise as one seeks to maximize cash expenditures for best laid plans.  With six people this game might become a bit more confrontational and enjoyable right off the bat, but with 4, it took forever before we got into conflict with each other and very little negotiation occurred before we called a halt to the game and moved on to something different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, light combat theme with an engaging theme and an interesting NYC setting.  The game is fun and is structured in such a way to encourage combat (which nicely discourages players from "turtling" -- which is often a problem in multi-player wargames of this type.  I think the different types of combat units and different means of transportation (limo, helicopter and speedboat) offer interesting tactical choices.  The major criticisms that I have are the relatively long downtime in between turns and the player elimination aspect.

We thought this would be a great game. Major downside: the rules, which appear Excellent at first glance, are breathtakingly poor. Shorthand terms are never explained, and sometimes a given thing is designated using different words. Whole mess makes it appear no one ever blind play tested. Drop rating from 6.5 to 6.0, started at 8. I had fun, but would not recommend it.

Aaagh, played this Thing again today twice. Getting the 'rules' down (have to make up our own based on spirit since many possibilities are not covered - ie, what happens if you attack into a corrupt precinct that has no personnel?). Almost called this crap, so further reduce rtg from 6 to 5.5.

Tired of buying game kits in a box. Will play this abomination again quickly through, to test out some new rule ideas.

...further reduce rtg to 5. Rules are crap. Effort has reached breathtaking stupidity. Has anyone who rated this colossal heap of disrespect actually played the thing?

2006-1-5: Rating dropping like a bullet. Charts that come with the game don't even cover the likely money you'll be dealing with! Why did they even bother?

[b]Bottom Line:[/b] The way to play this game and enjoy it is to get a rough idea of the rules, then ignore that there are what pass for rules. Go with your gut, with what feels right. Play it like a pretend kid-game. Else you'll be doing a lot of work on this one.

Definitely a step up over other area control games.  Very easy to lose control of your family if you don't watch out.  Unfortunately, it tends to play itself out too long for what it brings to the table, but at least it lets you indulge in some gangta action.

Easy to learn the rules.  We laughed a lot and had a lot of fun for the first 2 hours.  Then it turned a bit grindy.  We called it at about 3 hours with about 1 hour to go.

Folks who don't like dice fests won't like this.

The counter limits creates the winner as much as anything else.  You get a lot of troops- no one else can win against them- so they can't buy any pieces.  Might makes send to have a counter limit per city district.

Turtling works well and rewards well.

Player elimination is required in this game.

Typical old-school American game with player elimination, down-time, and long play time issues. 
However, with the right crowd, at least 4p, quick thinking people, and loads of trash-talking with beer, this becomes quite a fun, thematical game; if one doesn't mind the luck involved. Best played every once in a while.

We have played this game 3 times and have enjoyed it. The only negative is players have a tendacy to try and pick on the person they know are not good at this type of game.

It's a fun game, reminiscent of the old Gamemaster series, that brings nothing new to the table. Some people have compared it to Shogun, but it's more of an Axis and Allies --fixed starting points and all--, and I fear that might make it age badly once people start coreographing starting moves. So far (2 plays) it's been fun but, again, it's like playing a rethemed A&A, not a new game.

A neat variation on Risk. The minis are really cool, but the game is severely imbalanced based on your starting area, and the lack of money is a pain.

Probably the best game Eagle has produced/distributed to date.

La cosa più vicina a Risiko che mi è capitato di giocare negli ultimi anni. 
Un aspetto interessante del gioco è l'eterno dubbio tra l'espandersi sparpagliando i propri figliocci (e guadagnare di più) e l'evitare che i propri capibanda vengano catturati. L'accumulo non premia, asserragliarsi non funziona, innamorarsi dei propri possedimenti è fallimentare e pensare di essere al sicuro ancora di piu: dopo un paio di turni il boss è potenzialmente a tiro dei vicini, e da metà partita tutti potrebbero colpire tutti. 
Questa dinamicità imposta dalle regole non rende - fortunatamente - il gioco una risikiana guerra di posizione: vince chi rischia, anche perché chi attacca ha più vantaggi del difensore e la "bandierina" da non far cadere in mano nemica è un boss che si muove, partecipa agli scontri e dal quale avviene il "respawn" di tutti gli scagnozzi. I vantaggi nel farlo fuori (ereditando i suoi figliocci e quindi moltiplicando le proprie rendite) superano qualsiasi rischio di perdere gli uomini che ci hanno provato.
Non è un capolavoro: le meccaniche non hanno niente di innovativo, l'eliminazione dei giocatori è insolita per un gioco del XXI secolo oltre ad essere antipatica (si può uscire dal gioco anche 15 minuti dopo aver iniziato), ma tutto sommato ci si diverte e ti rammenta di quando facevi rotolare dadi per conquistare la Jacuzia.

Axis & Allies with Mafia in New York is the best description for this game.  Area control is important, and there are some cool strategic factors, like spreading your family members apart to rake in more money but also leaving yourself more vulnerable.

I've played it a few times now and can give an honest rating. BFiNY is a pretty good area of control/wargame with some high quality bits and pretty simple rules.

There's going to be alot of combat, and its going to get rough.  It's a good game to play with your 'wargaming' buddies, but there isn't much room for alliances and friendliness - it's a Blood Feud! Many times you can find that a battle ends with noone standing - the bloodbath - and its well documented within.

All and all, a good game. But really, you want to make sure you play this with people who like this type of game.  Reminiscent of 'Samurai Swords', yet simpler. Limousines, speedboats, and helicopters provide key options for quick movement.

Couple more notes:  This game CAN suffer from mobilization immobilization, where players just keep buying more and more stuff and don't actually do anything other than look threatening.  Also, beware of who you play this with!!  Sore losers need not apply!!!

Update: 
Played again.. Ok.  The money in this is just silly.. Monopoly money would have been better.  Even still, because within 2 phases you're earning and then spending money right away, there really is no sense for it.  And if I'm going to go for teh $6000 win, where's the $500s?  Come on, folks.  Not going to dock a point because I do want to play, but I'll just bring a calculator instead.

picked it up at walmart (online only deal) for $20 bucks! woo woo!  Unfortunately the game isn't that great with 3 players or less.  I'd have to say it requires some heavy modification for 3 or 2 players (e.g. limiting the areas on the board which can be utilized in a 3 player and for 2 player i'd say you'd have to at least play with 2 family's per player.)  Overall just ends up being a dice throwing slug fest on par with risk.

One thing I really like is the watch your back aspect to the game.  Just like real gangsters, got to watch your back for someone to come from behind and get you.  This game has this.

Every time our group has played this game we have had a blast and the outcome has always been unpredictable.  

Has a nice blend of luck and strategy.  

If you like Axis and Allies and those type of games and are looking for a different theme, this game may be it.  It sure was for us.

It's especially harsh when you start aiming for the "family members" since losing them has such a crippling effect on income. But I LOVE the theme.

Have played a 3-player and 4-player and both were a hoot.  Game has a lot of cool feel about it.   Components very good quality (I painted several limos, Helis, speedboats, Corrupt Precincts and penthouses in Red, Blue, Green, Yellow to add some flair knowing we'll never play 6 anyway).  The Bronze, Silver, Gold for the hired Muscle was a stroke as it is very easy to distinguish the quality of the 3 muscle groups at a glance.   Board is beautiful.  And the downtime between turns is wisely spent planning your next moves and checking who can strike you where.  It really rewards those who Think and Act like a mob-boss.  However, VERY Cut-Throat and a player can be knocked out of the game early.

Excellent and, most of all, FUN game.  Easy to lure my three boys away from the Xbox with this one.  Great rules, great theme, high aggression rewarded.  Turtles(in penthouses) can and must die the death of a thousand cuts:  take away their territories early and often.  Capice?

A game that rewards aggressive gameplay and eschews turtling.  Two player games can get bloody very quickly (chopper assaults) unless precautions are taken (corrupt precincts, Penthouses).  Downtime is slightly problematic (number crunching the amount of money you get each turn), but other than that it is a good, solid game.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game.  Kind or a cross between axis and allies and risk. Great pieces and board.  really well made.    Could use  a victory point system so this isn't so original Risk like i.e once a player is out, the game should be over because that guy has to wait another hour or two before this game is over.  Pretty good game otherwise.  I think this likely plays best with 3 since there are not many pieces or money for that matter.  Works okay with two. additionally using the Manhattan variant can make it more interesting and possibly quicker.

Looking at the box you would say this is Risk in mob controlled New York.  However, it is actually an economic game that is fueled by battles for area control.  The rules are written poorly, but the game is OK.

I've tried it a couple times now. I like it a lot better than Axis and Allies - it's that type of game, only much cooler and quicker I think.

I am unhappy with the clarity of the rulebook, but after some research on the internet I got most of the questions answered. My group much prefers to allow only 1 Illicit Activity per turn, otherwise the first player to take out a boss often gets Incontestible Dominance really quickly and easily.

It's a fun game, even if I'm not very good at it.

Very similar in game mechanics to both "CotE" (original/MB GM Series) and "Shogun / Samurai Swords" (MB GM Series).  Better combat system (much!), than CotE, and the investment and ROI aspect of "factoring" one's crminal empire income is very interesting.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] 5 and 4 player games. I enjoyed how much we all immediately got into the theme of the game. Veteran A&A-type gamers all, we got the game rolling pretty quickly and had a great game of murder, racketeering, kidnapping, and extortion. (This is not a game for kids.) But for a group of guys in their late 30's, this provided 5 hours of fairly quick moving fun. I suspect it will play more quickly now that we know the game and certainly quicker with less players. 

The rules could use an official FAQ to straighten out a few hazy areas, but overall they did a nice job with some nice illustrated examples. The pieces are just great. The money needs $500 and $1000 bills. The mapboard and counters could be thicker, but aren't bad.

I'd give this an "8" if the game length was shorter and the pace was quicker.

Most recent plays 8-25-05 with Garrett, Mike, Ben W, and Pat and then 10-30-09 with Garrett, Carter, and Joel.

RATING: 6.5
For some reason, I couldn't stop giggling as aspects of the game were explained to me. Images of Pacino blasting with his M16 in Scarface kept coming to mind.

The gameplay is decent. Players expand and build up a mafia empire, gaining income to build more troops. They win by taking over Manhattan or eliminating all other players or getting $6K of income in one turn.

The theme is great. Combat is ok.

Poor placement of the gang boss and family members and can lead to an early wipeout of players. Watch out for limos, choppers and boats that could easily attack your strongholds. Place corrupt precincts in good locations to block off other bosses.

Personally, I like going for a Manhattan blitz.

Loooonnnnnggg downtime between players is a big detraction to the gameplay.

Played once, with five players. We voted to quit after 90 minutes. All but one player turtled down into defensive positions, and the turns went slowly due to all the arithmetic when spending money. Combat was fun, but the pace of the overall game discouraged us from wanting to finish. I personally would like to try this again using a few of the variant rules here at BGG, because this game has such wonderful components.

RATING: N/A
Mafia-themed wargame played on a nice big map of New York City. Families from up to 5 boroughs and New Jersey fight for control of the city.

Over 300 miniatures: Each player has a boss and 5 lieutenants, and they buy and compete for dozens of thugs, henchmen and hitmen.  Limos, speedboats and helicopters are available to transport your crews.  Shady buildings represent various rackets, and penthouse palaces provide secure bases of operations.

The bits in this game are nuts...there must be hundreds of them...thugs, henchmen, family members, assasins, helecopters, speedboats, highrise penthouses, elicit buildings...it is nuts.  The idea is to take over New York pitting one mob family against all others.  You can hold Family members hostage, you can pay off the police, and of course you kill all those that stand in your way all in the name of MONEY!  So the negative is this...it's out of print and the mechanics (some might say) aren't all that tight making it a difficult sell for those hard core Euro-players, but it is what it is, a mobster fighting game and I love the idea.  I was able to purchase this for 19.95 a few years ago and I'm glad I did...don't be scared away by the paper money or the Ameritrash feel, I think it's fun.

If you'd like to play Tony Soprano in the middle of a turf war, this is the game.

With the plastic bits, illustrated rule book and big box, Blood Feud would have fit right smack dab in the middle of the old Milton-Bradley GameMaster line: not as good as Shogun or Fortress America, but better than (the original) Conquest of the Empire or Broadsides & Boarding Parties.

If you've got guys who are ready to roll dice and talk with bad accents, you'll enjoy this one. Not enough to play every week, but great fun once in awhile.

Gang-themed dudes-on-a-map with rich-get-richer income and dicey combat. Rules for helicopters, speedboats etc. add a bit of cinematic flair. Gangster miniatures are horrendous. Which is to say: mediocre dicefest on the same planet as Axis and Allies, and like that game a design superseded by any number of superior options. No reason to ever play.

I once read a description that said "Blood Feud is like Shogun with helicopters!" - and this actually is not a bad description for what to expect. 
I love the different elements of the game, the various gangster types, vehicles, and business houses, penthouses etc.
The game allows player elimination, which might put some people off, especially because it has a long play time. There are some house rule suggestions on BGG to address this, though.
Game length could easily shortened by reducing the income target necessary to win, or by agreeing on a fixed number of game rounds.

I suppose my feeling on this could change, but I don't imagine this ever being enough fun to warrant the time investment. I built up too many buildings early on in the game and painted a big target on myself. The other two players took the bait and decimated me over the course of the next few rounds. That left me neutered, but not dead, so I did the dishes and cleaned up the house over the next 90 minutes between my meaningless turns. I was starting to build up a little bit of a force out in the boondocks when the other two players called it a game because one could see the writing on the wall, and didn't want to spend 30 minutes playing it out. Enough said.

Kill your enemy's Boss and you control their gang. Buy police protection and move around safely. When your family members congregates in one borough, they are safe, but earn you no income bonuses.

Can be fun if you play it with the appropriate mindset.  Unfortunately, it's easy to stray from the mindset, and consequently suck all of the fun out of the game.  For all the economy-building, it's a game based on eliminating units at its core.  Unfortunately, this game does several different things alright, but doesn't do anything well.  Combat, economy, and negotiating are all adequate, but none of them are exceptional.  The only thing it does well is the theme, and modern day organized crime is not something that gets me really excited.  Anytime anybody suggests this, I'll be likely to suggest something else.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly quick (~2h inc. rules explanation with 5 first-time players). Income of $6000+ to win seems impossible with a base income of just $10 per district but it accumulates very quickly. Expected a long player elimination game with 2-3 players slugging it out at the end, but the game was won on income ($7000+ with $6000+ required) with the first player elimination and gang take over. Alas, that was because I messed up the take over rules - the taken over gang's districts should become neutral and the gang members should be moved to their new boss, so they do not count as income multipliers immediately. This would give other players at least one round to counter-attack and stop the new merged gang from winning.

On a very large map of New York, including all the suburbs in Queens and Brooklyn, players build up their gangs of thugs, goons and hit men. Move these around the city in limos, speedboats and helicopters, attack your enemies, and take control of boroughs to earn income and hire more gangsters. Kill your enemy's Boss and you control their gang. Buy police protection and move around safely. When your family members congregates in one borough, they are safe, but you earn you no income bonuses. Put a family member in each borough and your get bonuses to income, but then they are vulnerable to attack. There are 300 plastic figures for the different characters, buildings and vehicles. The helicopters are very good. The rotors spin when you blow on them. The game has detailed rules with tables for combat but also a set of clear diagrams. You could start playing in a few minutes.

Blood Feud in New York comes with giant piles of gangster minis, speedboats, helicopters, limos and penthouses. The board is a dull, but surprisingly accurate territory map of New York City (one of my friends found the small side street he used to live on!). Other than that, it's just dice and generic cardboard control markers for each family. Did I happen to mention the helicopters?.

At it's core, Blood Feud is pretty much a Risk variant, albeit one with speedboats. Did I forget to mention the helicopters? With rotors that spin? I hope not, because it has them! Like Risk, gameplay boils down to grab land, build guys, and swing. While I admit this sounds rather dull, Blood Feud throws in enough wrinkles to keep you on your toes. It is very difficult to wall up and hide, so the action tends to be fast and furious. Attackers have a huge advantage, and the increased mobility provided by the game's vehicles allow for very little turtling. The game revolves around player elimination, as killing your opponent's Dons is the fastest way to grow your empire. This can be a bummer if someone gets knocked out fast, but I'm not sure the game would work without it.

The plastic miniatures of Blood Feud in New York scream Mafia game, but everything else is pretty non-committal. The game is a lot more fun than it probably should be, although like Arkham Horror, the wrong game group can kill it. Blood Feud relies heavily on the players' imaginations to connect with its theme. The crime families that players control are left non-ethnic and nameless, and jobs are referred to simply as illicit activities. I wouldn't expect them to use "historical characters", but a little fictional write up on each family to set the stage for the game would have been a nice touch to strengthen the theme. As it sits, the action can get a little repetitive unless accompanied by threats, smack talk, ethnic slurs, and creative monikers for the illicit activities. Unquestionably, a group that roleplays this up with a good sense of humor will raise the fun factor immensely.

Great theme, super components including a huge board and lots of plastic figures, fairly simple rules.  Needs a few more scenarios.    Sort of a cross between Risk and A&A.  Not a lot of new ground is broken in mechanics but don't look here if you want a war game.  It's about money and killing off your opponents to become the sole Godfather.  The limited available units play nicely into the mix so don't expect to be able to go out and recruit an army of hit men like you would buy up tanks or infantry in a war game.  There's plenty of room for alliance and/or backstabbing.  Play smart or be rubbed out.  Not your  Eurogame affair so if you're looking for bidding, trading, and group hugs, play something else. So in summarizing a long comment, I like it.

Risk in New York.  It's a bit long for what it is, but it's fun to play with the right group.  Our house rule is that you have to add flavor to your mafia.  As an example, the first time we played I had the Icelandic mafia who make their fat cash selling bootlegged Bjork CDs.

When I first played this game, I felt that there was a certain degree of luck involved in overcoming the big bad. Now looking back on it, it's an overall harder set than the first (or base) set was. As a standalone expansion, the difficulty curve is very much welcome as a person who has been playing this game, but not so much for newcomers learning this game. The first and and second sets combine well, at least.

[ESP] Un juego de creación de mazos en el cual el jugador debe tratar de armarse lo mejor posible para enfrentar a los distintos ¿zombies? que hay en el juego. 
Si te gusta Dominion y creíste que Thunderstone te iba a gustar más ya que permite enfrentarse a mountros, creo que esta es una mejor altermativa que Thunderstone ya que lo logra mucho más...

It is true that the Resident Evil game is broken in many ways, but that actually makes the game fun. Leon's special ability is OP and some others. The allies part of the game makes it very easy...:D
Still a great game.

Not one of the best deck building games but definitely the most thematic. Certainly worth trying. 
It is one of the games where you have to optimize the most and it can seem nearly impossible for newbies to slay the villian in story mode.

Really enjoy playing this game in many of it's various modes including fan made modes. Probably biased as I'm a big Resident Evil fan. Most common thing I hear people say they don't like is the randomness of the mansion. If this is the case I highly recommend GibbRS's variant Escalation. It's probably my favorite way to play.

RATING: 6.5
This made the game much more difficult as your weapons do far less damage for pretty much the same amount of ammo.

There are also less actions that can combo off one another making this more difficult, but not impossible to break than the previous version.

Sold with base game in 2017.

I own a large number of games (1300+), yet this is the first one I have ever rushed out to purchase the first day it hit the market.  (It was also a 50 mile trip.)  Then I had to sleeve 250 cards before I could play!

What's New:  This stand alone expansion introduces partnering 2 characters, events that are shuffled into the mansion, action cards that can be used during another's turn, and characters who can increase their bodies "into infected slaying machines."  Some new characters, new monsters, weapons, actions, items, etc., many of which have references that pertain to the Partnering, and an ammunition card "Treasure"card.

There are a LOT of questions we have about the cards & the partner rules, but the Bandai site does not have a FAQ list yet. Even when we agree, we are still unconvinced it is correct.

One advantage of the "partnership" (when a player has two characters instead of 1), is that you can attach weapons & cards (maximum of 2) to your partner that are available in every turn.  This speeds the game up.  

Since the main thrust of this box is the "partnerships," until some of our questions get answered, not very impressed. The two boxes can be combined, but many of the cards in this new Alliance box I would never use if we are not playing the partner mode--that doesn't leave much in the box.

After a few more games my rating might go up, for now I rate it less than the base game which I rated an 8.5.

EDIT: Have now played all the modes numerous times, including Partnership, and the Versus Mode is by far the best.

Doesn't add much to the base game. If not playing partner mode, a sizeble chunk of characters and action cards are unusable. Flash grenades are next to useless. All in all, a very underwhelming expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love the addition of the push your luck mechanic with the combat system; it works well with the deck building and adds a lot of tension. Having played many Resident Evil video games, the mechanics fit the theme very well and I did almost feel the same worries of not knowing whether I had enough fire power to kill enemies in unexplored rooms, the stress of having to organize the resources I found along my exploring, and the excitement of finding a random new powerful weapon to take on the hordes of infected trying to tear me apart. The variable gameplay time keeps this game lower for me; I've had very fast games and games so long that they tested my patience.

Now that I have the base set, Alliance, Mercenaries, Nightmare and Outbreak, Resident Evil has become my favourite deck building game.
Alliance introduce Partner mode which is nice when playing only with Alliance, when combining cards from all the sets, the Partner mode makes the game too easy.
Actions like Quirk of Fate, Desperate Escape, Gathering Forces and Fierce Battle are always welcome in my game!
The Blowback Pistol is my favourite Pistol from all set that I have.  The Riot Shotgun, or the even better Triple Barreled Shotgun, are a must if playing Mercenary mode!

As said, RE DBG is amazing, and even with so many years, it 's still the best DBG.

This expansion features Albert Wesker as a boss, the first with an added effect and the one with most decorations (love him!); this expansion adds and interesting twist with weapons and exploration, encouraging to remember the revealed and not defeated infected. Also, this expansion introduces the 2 partner mechanics, it wasn't very sucessful though, but is an interesting option to change play sessions. 

Flamethrower is an intersting and very powerful weapon, specially with Billy, and maybe only flaw is the laser targetting, because it always returns, but you can change it as we do with rocket launcher, or house rule it to 1-3 uses (your choice) without problem.

Also, it still has a very good price for a full expansion, and also a vintage one. In fact, I started with this one, you could do the same!

I actually don't mind the "partner" aspect of Alliance. You certainly don't have to use it, but it's nice especially solo as it helps mitigate the randomness of exploring and beefs up your damage output. Some fun cards in here as well.

HUNK's custom loadout breaks the game. I found that with a few purchases its possible for him to draw and play every card in his deck every turn, while loading and powering up a Riot Shotgun, allowing him to take out 2 enemies each turn. He is so broken that in Mercenaries mode I've gotten scores in the thousands while everyone else had trouble achieving scores above thirty.

Alliance brings partner mode into the game. Now players can explore with two characters, whereas the partner has quite some limitations and this makes for some interesting decisions.

New Mansion, new weapons, all new actions and loads of stuff to add or combine with the base game. Great stuff!

Doesn't really add anything worthwhile to the main game, except a few nifty weapons. But all the weapons (except the 'nades) are so much better than the base game that you're sad when you have to get a base game weapon. At least the Russian Assault Rifles are actually worth buying, as opposed to the crummy SMGs from the first game. 
Parters mode kind of sucks, and almost every single action card is only useful in partner mode. Great Ambition is way too good.

Nice addition to a good deck building game. The infected have a good set of new nasty surprises. My only complain seems to stem from the fact that the "partner" feature allows for really overpowered duos. A good setup will totally get rid of the other players in a rather quick fashion. It also seems that the flamethrower makes for a somewhat unbalanced setup where the person with it would have a great advantage over people without it, particularly when assigned to the partner.

I was less thrilled with this expansion, as it continues to over-complicate an already confusing game when you are first learning it. I also feel some of the cards in this expansion should have been better fine-tuned.

RATING: 5
The weakest expansion for Resident Evil DBG (though it's technically a standalone game). The partner mechanic that was introduced didn't feel like it executed very well when I've played, and unfortunately many of the heroes included in the expansion play around that new addition. 

A few more plays may boost that for me, but for now I'm leaving it at the lower score. At the moment, I consider it worth having just so there are extra cards in the pool to pick from during setup.

Finally, we played "Alliances" in partner mode and I think that is where the beauty of it lies, and now I like this addition to the REDBG universe. It is a nifty thing to have the partner with his attached weapons and other cards, but it can be nifty, too, to get rid of him under certain circumstances. For us, a very nice alternative to regular REDBG. 
This additional game can be combined with the base game but can be played alone (as opposed to the expansion "Outbreak" which needs the base game). It has some of the same issues as all the games have, the rule book is quite often on the poor side and sometimes you need to do Internet research or house rule situations (which I am fine with). The Red herb is a bit of a pain but since you can customize and choose the resources any way you like it is up to you whether to leave it in. The characters seem a bit unbalanced but maybe it only takes the right mode, with the right resources to learn to appreciate a certain character.
With all its issues, I still love this game series, it is a fast, thematic deck builder, and I always thoroughly enjoy playing it, hence my high rating.

Alliance introduces a neat mechanic in the Partner mode, but Bandai didn't address one of the major flaws of the core set- the scarce quantities of some cards.

Card quantities notwithstanding, there are two serious problems with Alliance: 1) No rules for playing with more than 4 players, and 2) the box inlay is atrocious- the cards barely fit in the designated slots, which were much better spaced the first time around.

Character-wise, Alliance is also a little disappointing. Many of the characters are handcuffed to specific cards, and are severely hampered if they aren't on the table. Likewise, Josh is not a viable character unless you are playing with a partner.

Not a must-buy, even for fans of the license.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Alliance doesn't seem to be a great starting point. If you play the vanilla mode, the monster deck is too strong. Many of the heroes are worthless without the ally mode. I wish I got the normal starter set instead. 

Score based Mercenary mode is strange, but not bad.

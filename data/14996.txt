RATING: 6
Really good gateway game, it never missed the target so far. Simple rules, some strategic and tactical play and a good amount of luck, decent playing time (maybe a bit too long). The problem is that I bring this game to the table only with non gamers, due to its lack of variability, really interesting decisions and, in the end, any real depth. It's rummy with a board and some positional play. Still better than the original TtR, which is even lighter.

DoW version. Great components.

Cool little game.  Seems an ideal gateway game for people who like games but have never heard of anything in your collection.  I'd played vanilla Ticket to Ride before, so I was a bit unsure of the stations, tunnels and ferries, but overall I'd say they are good additions.

Best at 3 or 4, it's the TTR edition I reach for when I'm playing with more than 3 (or more than 2 if I don't want as mean of a game that Nordic would create) as I find the map and long routes the most interesting. The stations are a nice touch if you get hosed on that long route or caught out near the end and use that last turn to try and complete something. In particular, the addition of the tunnels and ferries gives the game an edge of the US standard.

My wife's favorite game and one that I also really enjoy. It is very easy to learn and a good game to play while carrying on a conversation. The game has beautiful artwork and is well built. The cards are bigger on this version (bigger than the USA version), which I really like. The kids enjoy it too so it is a great family game. I highly recommend it!

We have played this dozens and dozens of times, especially on the iOS app, but my gaming tastes have moved on in recent years. It's a good game to introduce to casual gamers, but we haven't played this in a good while and I have no desire to play this again any time soon. Maybe by the time our 2 year old son has grown up enough to play board games, we'll pull this out again.

So accessible and yet at least some depth. Perfect family game and is rated as such (as family games go, it's a 7, but I'd usually rather play another 7 than this...).

RATING: 6
Essentially an expansion map for Ticket to Ride shamelessly produced and priced as a whole board game.

Having another map for the original game is always nice but this one also adds two new features which are a step backwards, and that is the tunnels which are a push your luck aspect which makes a light game even lighter and more random, and the stations are almost pointless. Incredible that a lesser design (Europe vs original USA map) won a gaming award.


Own the [boardgame=53383]Europa 1912[/boardgame] expansion.

The best base version of Ticket to Ride (the Europe map is better than the basic American one). It will become a household name in our lifetime, and is something every family or play group should have. 

Again, Europe is better than the original/10th Anniversary map and rules, but for smaller playgroups of couples or threes the Nordic base game is also recommended. Europe is still better however and more easily integrates with the map pack expansions.

120909 I do NOT like ANY of the added mechanics in the game.  I don't mind the locmotive required gray route but nothing else recommended the game to me.  In fact I may bump up my TtR America rating due to this play of Europe.

The game itself was ok, but its best use is to highlight how clean and elegant the original was.  I could be talked into playing it again, but I would strenuously push for the original.

RATING: 7
Ticket to Ride:  Europe is an above-average strategy game.  There's a lot of planning and you really have to try to figure out what your opponents are doing, otherwise, they might take valuable tracks before you can.  

There's a fairly good skill element to this game, but if I have a complaint, it's that there is a significant luck element in which routes you draw at the beginning of the game.  It can be difficult to win with some of the Western European routes, and there's one high-scoring route between two cities that vastly superior to all others.  In this sense, the game ends up being a bit like Risk in that there are really only maybe 3-4 viable winning strategies against good players.

All the same, it's still a fun game with a lot of strategy.  I think somewhere around a "7" is probably an appropriate rating.

Good game on hand management. The train stations and tunnels add a layer of welcomed complexity to this game. However, I felt it was too easy to finish your routes at 2p - there wasn't enough blocking and player interaction going around. Probably more fun and higher player counts. Also it's difficult if you're new to the board and am sitting such that you have to read the places upside down. 

Lastly, the insert is wonderful, albeit a bit too big.

The stations are a good addon to the basic game but I'm not sure about the tunnels and ferries. Worst of the TTR series.

2014/10
Original = Best for families with 4-5 players, elegant rules, suffers from card hoarding strategy

Märklin = Most satisfactory for gamers, strong incentive to make early plays mitigating the hoarding problem, a bit fiddly

Nordic = Best for families with 2-3 players, slight hoarding problems which are mitigated by the tight map, random take that aspects due to the tunnel mechanics

Europe = worst of the bunch in all aspects

RATING: 9
How to make a great game better?  Well, maybe.  I thought so at first, but now maybe not.

Having said that, anyone who likes TtR is almost bound to love this.  Here's some pointers as to what's good about this: the set up of the cities and the routes between them creates a different challenge (there are less double routes and more short routes); it's fun to see that one side of the board (the West) is very congested and the other is quite sparse and tends towards longer routes; there are many obvious blocking ponts...but; the new mechanism of stations helps to unblock those and I love the fact that if you chose to play one you effectively lose points at the end; the ferries add another interesting touch and thinking point; the tunnels are a (realistic) stroke of genius - there could have been lots of possibilites for how to model this but the way it's been done strikes me as perfect - after all digging tunnels could be a gamble - would you hit harder or weaker rock?; the length 8 route worth 21 points is great fun; the designer has made it more useful to pick up Locos (you need them!) and and to draw extra destination tickets; everyone gets one long route at the start (but doesn't have to use it) and that strikes me as a good leveller.  A smashing game that is significantly different from the original and more of a "gamer's-game."  I suppose some will try to adopt different rules from the two versions together.  I'm happy, for now, to have this, the original and the unofficial Belgian variant. I do, however, look forward to a future Mystery train Expansion for this.  And I'm excited enough to put forward some ideas  - Tunnelling Mole (burrow at normal cost), Ferry Owner - travel over ferries without locos, Station Master - play one station without losing points at the end.  The possibilities are exciting!

I find this game difficult to remember where the cities are that I am trying to get to. This is because I am unfamiliar with the names being written the way that country writes them. I will learn them eventually but part of me wishes they were written the 'English' way.

My family likes this game. We don't score anymore, we just get a sense of who won and who gets the most finished journeys.

Rating TTR series as a whole.

Even though this series jumped the shark back in 2010 (seriously, who plays Ticket to Ride so much that they need 18 different maps to play it on??), some of the earlier entries in the series are great.  Ticket to Ride is normally a go to game for newbies who have never tried a Euro style board game before.

The European edition is great for 4 to 5 players.  While there is still stress associated with claiming routes, the addition of the stations make losing a key route less game-breaking.  Over numerous plays, we have discovered that the player who draws the "Brest-Petrograd" long route at the beginning of the game seems to win a disproportionate share of the time.

A beautiful game, pretty lightweight, enjoyable to play with non-gamers and gamers (although, if I've got some gamers togehter I'd rather pull out something meatier). Doesn't feel substantially different from the original despite the changes (if I had to pick, I'd say that I like this one a little bit more).
Update 2005 05 14: I still slightly prefer this version to the original, but I wish I had bought the original. Why? Because there are just enough fiddly rules here, combined with a less accessible/ familiar map, to alienate the casual players this is aimed at. In the end, I wanted a game to pull out with the family, etc, so simpler would have been better. If I want a more strategic game, I'll choose an entirely different game.

Why it's previously-owned:
I'm not really sure that I ever liked this game very much.  It was fine and all, but there wasn't much draw for me.  I simply got it because it was the gateway game at the time that everybody must have. 
I traded this game away for Age of Empires: III.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

There're games with simple rules that are lots of fun. This game is not one of them. Ticket to Ride is not a bad game by any means but it is a very mediocre and disappointing one. I saw countless reviews and game-plays before buying it... and the game never sounded fun to me, but I ended up picking up a copy anyway. I needed a good gateway game to introduce people to the hobby during my Erasmus scholarship and on-line tons of people kept going over and over about Ticket to Ride being the best of them. So I decided to try it.

I understand that this is my opinion and experience, but Ticket to Ride really didn't work for me. I sincerely don't understand what is the fun of collecting cards turn after turn after turn, until you can finally play something. There's some tactics involved for sure, but the mechanics are really not exciting. It's the just same thing over and over again! Furthermore every time I played it, Ticket to Ride felt too long for what it is. I ended up wishing for the game to end and ironically so did the other people at the table: those that I wanted to introduce to board-gaming. I understand that TtR is a simple family game and it was wrong from me to expect more... maybe the hype ruined this for me, but I can also name a bunch of other family games that are way more fun and way better as gateway game. Terribly mediocre game.

The United Kingdom/Pennsylvania expansion brought some new life into this game and it actually made me enjoy it more. Yet I still think that Ticket to Ride is an average game that doesn't work for me.

Rating without expansion: 5.

Bought at first ever Games Expo in Birmingham (England) 2007.Excellent game. No dice, but still a small amount of luck in that you draw train cards from a large deck. But the skill comes in duping other players into thinking you`re doing something different, card counting, and reckoning on the possibility of completing long routes. This is a winner.

Ticket to Ride is hardly a confrontational game. I can understand that it can be really frustrating to plot a route and have a key section taken away from you, but in my mind, that's the whole game!

Stations are silly. I can't imagine anything being more multiplayer solitaire than this.

I like this better than Ticket to Ride, but the two are similar enough that I wouldn't own both.

An excellent implementation of TTR idea - I like the stations and I like the "long route" cards. I'm not as happy with ye olde names (but understand an attempt to be on-theme), and I still have trouble finding some of the sities despite playing it 20+ times in comparison to TTR-USA. However, given a choice I'll play TTR-Europe because the stations can save your bacon and it leads to less angst between players!

A neat train building game. The key is to build the longest continuous line in order to gain more points and win the game. You also must be strategic about which routes you pick and if you pick up more tickets as unfinished tickets incur a penalty in the final scoring.

RATING: 8
I love some of the new game elements in Ticket To Ride Europe. In particular, I like the new train stations, which let you use another player's route (but only once) to complete a ticket. I also like the new ticket distribution system, which makes sure that all players get one long route. At the beginning of the game, all the 20-21 pt. routes are shuffled and each player gets 1 long route and 3 regular route tickets - you must keep at least 2 of them (the other long route cards and any discarded tickets are removed from the game). I enjoy the TTRE map, but mostly because I like Europe better than U.S. for locations. I think the TtRE map is less accessible than the original one with less ways to get to targeted cities, and more restrictions on the cards needed to get there. The new tunnels and ferries force you to wait for the right cards to become available, which can be a hassle.

Now, if I used the train stations and new long route ticket distribution in the original TtR (especially with the Mystery Train Expansion), I think it would be better than both TtR and TtRE!

2015 UPDATE: This one stands the test of time. Still a good one!

While I think that this version is still an enjoyable game it lacks the simplicity of the original version in what is essentially the same game.

A very simple and beautiful game for everyone but be warned that it has a strong luck element in the original drawing of the cards and later on you can be messed up if the train cards don't come up your way and you're racing with others for the same routes! Europa 1912 expansion is a must in order to balance things up with the addition of the new cards and new ways to play it. Still I prefer Carcassonne (mostly) and Catan among the big-3!

A brilliantly designed game that is colourful, fun and easy to learn (unless you are my father who spent half the game waiting for the "brown" train cards to come up - he was in fact waiting for "orange.")

The best part about this game is that you don't know exactly who has won until the very end so it's all to play for. It's very satisfying to leap ahead of your opponents who think they are the clear winners.

You can also make it more strategic if you want it to be but I like the family friendly aspect of it all. 

Bad points would be that luck has a large part to do with it. If you get good starting ticket cards or draw several that have routes which you've practically already completed you are likely going to win.

Like Settlers there is quite a bit of luck, but it is such fun to play that I don't mind. The level of tension is HUGE on this one.

RATING: 7
I like how this one fleshes out the TtR system, adding tighter choke points, but also a way to handle getting blocked (stations), or a press your luck element (tunnels), or really useful connections that are harder to complete (ferries). The map feels a lot more constrained (which hurts a touch its gateway appeal), and the destinations are foreign to a State-sider (also hurting its gateway appeal). I personally don't see how this is appreciably better than USA (maybe I need to play with the Europe expansion), but it's nice for a change of pace.

Ticket to Ride Europe is an improvement over the original and 
I regard it even better as Ticket to Ride Märklin. The Europe map is more balanced than the USA one. However the tunneling and the mandatory joker cards do not add much. 

The newly added stations however are a big improvement. You are no longer annoyed by broken routes, but suffer a victory point penalty instead. 

TtR:E lacks in scalability. The number of trains (45) does not vary with the number of players. And that matters!

Like the other games in the TtR series, a fun and fastplaying game. Not in game length, but in time per player per turn.

The rarely seen case in which all of the changes for the sequel are genuine improvements. I like the board better than plain TtR. I think the addition of ferry and tunnel spaces increase the importance of the engine (wild) cards in just the right way.

I didn't want to believe it but I have to admit that Ticket to Ride is a very nice game. It plays well with different ages and affords enough strategic and tactical choice for seasoned gamers to be enjoyed. In my opinion it captures the feeling of a game of Risk in a much shorter time and without player elimination. A true classic if I've ever seen one.

RATING: 7.75
The new standard for entry games. The best of the series with the routes and depots taking some of the luck out of the original game. 

Complexity - simple, you draw cards, place trains from cards in hand, or draw new tickets

Strategy - moderate, you have to be flexible. Being bold and managing your trains will net you a high score but you have to be timely and efficient or the game will end too soon for you. 

Luck - moderate, you have no say in what cards are available, what routes and train cards you draw randomly, only how to place them. Even the most flexible strategies can get beat by a good draw. 

Interaction - very high. Almost everything you do effects other players. There is a chance nobody will want to go to the areas you do or get the colored trains you have but that is not the case most of the time. 

Fun - with the luck factor moderate many skill levels can compete and first time players can even win. You can enjoy this game with friends but not if you are hoping a grand matter plan will win you the game for certain.

A nice, fast warm-up club game - the more players, the better and tenser it gets - overall a refinement of the original T2R.

A few points which may have been made by others: 1) You can discard the long routes and opt for the "many short routes" strategy 2) Despite the "easy to memorize" long routes, you can be stealthy about which one you have. 3) The timing of when to play those stations as the game comes to its swift and tense end is a fun addition to the end game 4) The tunnels encourage more strategic planning. I've found that only in a desperate bid for points in an end game will I play for a tunnel without a hand margin of at least one extra.

Not a huge fan of this game to be honest. I feel that, whilst the game is very visually pleasing and has been created by a great publisher, it did become too predictable. For starters, depending on your objectives, you may start the game with an almost impossible task and somewhat of a guarenteed loss. Also, as the game progresses, it can become obvious to others what your intentions are, which can make for some interesting blocks and twists, but also mean that your odds of winning are greately diminished

I still find the original to be the easiest to get new gamers into (mostly due to the slightly slimmer ruleset).  But the stations, ferries and tunnels certainly infuse a unique twist to the TTR experience.  The stations are great to easily bypass blocks and the Tunnels and Ferries help to reward players for better hand management.  Overall an excellent choice for people looking to get into TTR especially since you also won't have to purchase an expansion just yet for "normal" sized cards.

Train themes are never going to be my pick of themes, but, if you can put that aside and just play,  it is a fast, fun game that gives plenty of room for variations of strategic gaming.

RATING: 6
{2 plays, 4 & 5 player} I really like the Everyone Gets Only 1 Long Ticket thing, but, especially with 5 players, I hated the congestion.  There's something ultimately friendly about Ticket to Ride, and in turning it into more of gamer's game, it got a little evil.  Even worse, it didn't feel like a balanced evil - it seemed like the players on the East side of the board were in fewer fights.  And the track sort of bears this out, as the stuff on the East side is "harder" to complete - more locomotives, more tunnels, etc.  Interestingly enough, in a 4-player game NO ONE needed to use a station, whereas the 5-player game saw two players use at least one, and one use two (and ALL of those players lost to, you guessed it, the player who had the Eastern routes).  I definitely prefer the original.

Tunnels and stations add a nice twist.  Adds a little more variability in the game.  Given the very tight map, stations provides a little bit of an "easier" way to connect routes but since they don't count for the longest route and you have to throw away 4 points to use it, it forces users to use it only when necessary.

Die US-Version mit Spaß bei Frank gespielt. Die Europa-Version gefällt mir aber noch besser. Die Tunnel und Fähren sind zusätzliche Herausforderungen und die Bahnhöfe geben extra Möglichkeiten um doch noch etwas realisieren zu können, was einem die lieben Mitspieler eigentlich schon verbaut hatten. Durch die Bahnhöfe und den vielen Möglichkeiten mit alternativen oder parallelen Routen (wenn manchmal auch durch unwegsame Tunnel) doch noch seine Tickets einlösen zu können, ist "Europa" besonders familien- und anfängertauglich.

Marginally better than the first version -- at least this one actually has a few more game elements than Gin Rummy -- but it is still essentially a case of mutual masturbation, as each player is practically always able to place his trains unfettered (at least in a 4-player game). Any blocking of your little plans will be made by other players unwittingly. Sorry, but to me this is not much of a game.

Introduced to the American version, and not to copy what someone else already has we bought the Europe version. Love as a game to play just with my spouse or with a full group filling the board with trains. The race to own a location and then the need to find a new path is so much fun. I also love the pacing (unless someone is hording cards and takes 5 minutes to sort their hand)

A nice game, easy to learn, a game where you have to plan ahead. However, there are very few player interactions (at least not conscious ones), a point I miss in this game. The original game's map makes for more route blocking, and thus enables you to effectively block other players.

Because of that, I actually prefer the original edition, although I like the idea of having separate long- and short-distance destination tickets (I'm not so positive about the train stations, but they are sometimes necessary, given the map).

Was well-received by my marginal-gamer friends.

Adds just enough to Ticket to Ride to make it a better game. However I do find this to be less tense due to the stations making routes easier to complete.
With the 1910 expansion Ticket to Ride becomes the better game

Still has simple and smooth gameplay like the original.

The additions of the tunnels and ferries add a little unnecessary complexity to the game. The train stations limit the effectiveness of blocking, which weakens an already underused strategy in the game that would make the game more interesting and interactive.

Still, despite these downsides, I don't view the game any worse than the original.

I like the additions of the stations, ferries and tunnels to the basic version.  The stations make life a little easier when someone cuts you off, while the ferries and tunnels make life a little more difficult.

Other than that, great game.

I typically play one game of Ticket to Ride with new players, and then move to Europe so they can learn with this version.  New rules make it much harder to destroy the game for an inexperienced player.

This feels more like a second edition than its own game.  There are some additional game play elements like tunnels, but the core game is mostly identical.  The production quality is higher and more refined in this edition than the original (if you own a first printing - later printings add in the same improvements that Tt2R: Europe does).  Some player may find the language choice and spelling of the cities as frstrating since they are not the US names.  Visually, this is a better game than the first, but it does not get the table time that the first does.  [GTI: TGCL]

I love Ticket to Ride, and I love this version. I own both the US map and Europe. If you have played the US map, then you know the basic idea is to build a train that connects points on a map. Same thing here, but because Europe is a more condensed area, you get the addition of train stations - which allow players to use opponents' routes in one direction. It also adds tunnels, where players must (after placing their train cars) draw three additional cars from the ticket deck. If one or more of those cards matches the color of cards the player placed to claim the route (or is a locomotive), the player must play additional tickets from their hand accordingly to successfully claim the tunnel. Europe also adds double routes to again account for Europe being more compact. That helps to lessen the chances of access being cut off to certain cities. In sum, I enjoy this version more, because it adds a tiny bit more complexity than the original. 8/10.

The game takes far too long (and has too much downtime) for the rather severe lack of meaningful strategy or player interaction. A pointless waste of time.
Not as horrible with 2 players (and presumably with 3) as with more, though still completely lacking in strategic aspects.

I traded this away for El Grande in the Essen 2012 math trade.

Just bought it. Will post my comments as soon as I give it a try!

UPDATE: I've just played 2 games with my wife, and so far, it's a very nice game. It's true it has a lot of luck with the card draws, but your approach can usually be modified according to the cards you have. Maybe a card exchange mechanic would have been nice, though.

UPDATE: Good game, but getting a little bit tired of the luck of the draw over the strategies chosen as a determining factor.

UPDATE: I didn't realize how much fun this game was. We've played a lot of times now, and still enjoy it. The only filler I find more fun than this one would be my new Thebes. Up to an 8, again.

UPDATE: Still like it, but not as much as before. Down to a 7.

RATING: 5.5
Not nearly enough player interaction to be interesting. It seems mainly that each player individually just gets on building his or her routes, which may or may not inadvertently result in another player having to make a detour. The large element of luck in the draw of the cards, not to mention those tunnels, doesn't help.
It's really a children's game, or one for non-gamers. I'll happily play with my family but would prefer something that feels like I'm playing against my opponents, rather than just in parallel to them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great graphics.  An improvement on the US version with the introduction of additional train laying conditions and the use of stations.  But still a game where you spend most of the game hoping your opponents are not going to make a particular move and getting stuffed when they do.  A negative rather than positive feel.

Fun game with great build quality .new players are impressed and take to it easily though were hesitant to take on the route cards as they were afraid to be penalized for not making a route that they had to keep.regardless the game played fine without these cards coming into play during the game even though the player who retained his largest route won the game and they realised after the fact that taking route cards was the way to go.overall great game.visually stimulating

Very basic game, entry level. Good for the whole family.
I guess it can be a bit cutthroat with the routes, but otherwhise its laid-back and you only have to make a few choices (like 1?) each round.

This is a great introduction to board gaming game. Easy to learn, turns are quick, lovely components, strategies can vary - or practically none still works, not (very) confrontational, usually fairly close and a complete game doesn't take too long. Super 'family' board game. Why this isn't the game all families have (instead of monopoly!)is a great shame.

An excellent game to play with 4-5 people, specially with new gamers or family.

Szerintem jobb, mint az eredeti. A pluszok (alagút, komp, állomás) kifejezetten előnyére váltak, nem mintha az alap játékkal komolyabb bajom lett volna. Ráadásul nagyon igényes is a játék (kártyák, doboz...). 
Hárman játszottuk, talán ezért volt meglepően rövid. Kevesebb, mint egy óra (bár ez a hivatalosnak megfelel, mégis az alapjátékkal 2-3 óráig játszottunk). Mire minden kiosztott célt teljesítettünk, vége is lett a játéknak, így egyetlen egyszer sem húztunk új küldetést...
---
Pár év szünet után újra előkerült. Szomorú, de találtunk egy stratégiát, ami kicsit unalmassá teszi, túl domináns: csak a 2 legegyszerűbb kis célt kell megtartani az elején, gyorsan megcsinálni, és a továbbiakban nem is törődni a célokkal, ehelyett rámenni a hosszabb szakaszokra (8,6,4,4,4,4...), minél gyorsabban kipörgeti a vonatokat, hogy hamar vége legyen, így a komolyabb célkártyáknak esélye sincs.

I have enjoyed this game on occasion, although it is somewhat simplistic and can drag when there are a lot of players.

This game pretty much only comes out when we are playing with non-gamer friends, especially kids. Even in these situations, however, there are better games like Bohnanza or Settlers of Catan that have more excitement and player interaction.

Easy gateway game. Played the USA one as well which differs that it has not the station building option. Maybe I like the Europe a bit better because of this option as it allows you to use routes when others took it from you. Also for beginning players this allows to correct mistakes. 

But overall both are good solid games.

A route buiding game with traditional rummy mechanics. Simple enough for beginners, but interesting enough for seasoned players as well.

Played several games on my iPhone, and the game is on par with the US version... It would be slightly better because it has tunnels, ferries and stations, but the long tickets, while a good idea, tend to be a bit samey after a while.
It is a great gateway game, like everything else in the TTR family, and probably more suited for european players who don't know (and don't care!) where the hell Duluth or Little Rock are located!

RATING: 6.5
I like that the rainbow cards are actually a required part of track building as oppose to just simply a wide card.

However, I am still not sure if I like it better that the original Ticket to Ride which I think is more competitive. This has more work arounds in terms of borrowing a build track from your opponent by using a station.

Not only the best "gateway" game ever created, the TTR series might have the best rules of any game in recent history. The games are simple, play quickly, have great components, and offer a ton of fun choices. The European version is slightly more complicated than the American version, but still increadibly simple. The changes in the European version make scoring with a lot of destination tickets a more viable strategy than in the American version. It is also harder to block your opponent, so this version doesn't feel as cut-throat. Despite being slightly more complicated, I think the changes in this version make it easier for kids and novices to win.

This is very similar to Ticket to Ride (US). I get bored pretty quickly waiting for my turn to put my four trains. You can put a lot of thought and strategy into it, but so many times you can be blocked by the other players. This and the US version are two games I could play at the same time and just switch back and forth until its my turn. There's no interaction while it's not your turn, so I end up chatting with other people while I wait or watching another game until it's my turn.

It's not really a train game (cf Alan Moon's Union Pacific which also isn't a train game but an investment game instead) but at least you lay "tracks" which are disguised as trains!

This is a great family game! My 7 and 8 year olds are able to understand the rules and strategies required to be competitive. They love placing the trains and completing the routes. I think the Europe version of this game is best with children as they can use stations to complete routes as an aide if needed which is a bit kinder than getting cut off mid route. Both children managed to beat me on just our second game as a family.

Based on one playing. Found the game light but enjoyable. Interaction between players is minimal though, consisting of trying to block their routes but it is at most a guessing game, as you really don't know which routes they are holding.

Our first play was only 2-player and that did the game no favour.
But the more we play the game with 4 players the better it gets. It really brightens up and although the game has only 4 possible actions per turn (Europe has the new mechanism of train stations), there are relatively lot of decisions to be made.

If you play as a couple on a regular basis, I can only recommend [thing=106645]the Switzerland map[/thing] which is for 2-3 players.

TTR-E gets a 1 from me because, for the Ticket to Ride series, this game is broken.  By means of the stations it removes the thing I love most about Ticket to Ride.  It doesn't have the nice push-your-luck feel of "Do I need to claim that route now or can I wait and take those cards that I really need?" On top of that the ferries are incredibly annoying.  A wild suddenly is not a wild.  As soon as you get a wild in your hand you know exactly which piece of track it will cover with little to no flexibility to be able to use it elsewhere.  Tunnels are only slightly less annoying but it does seem a good way to simulate the unknowns of building a tunnel.

My recommendation - try TTR-Marklin.  It magnifies the push-your-luck feel with passengers and is much much better in every way!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a great game to play when you want to have something in your hands while you talk.  The game is beautiful, the way the game mechanics are executed during play are easy to understand and smooth.  However, there simply isn't a great deal of depth of strategy (i.e. build routes for the best point efficiency) and there is more luck involved than I prefer (i.e. I've completed my long route I hope I can get lucky and draw some shorter routes that are within my longer route for some easy points).  I've downgraded its rating from 7 to 6 (this edit 2.8.12) because I've it enough and other boardgames to now know it is a great game to introduce to people who are intimidated by board games, and/or, as I mentioned earlier, have something in your hands and on the table while you socialize.

EDIT 3.5.12 - Game no longer available for trade.

Love this game - its great to introduce to new players and there is plenty of interesting decisions.  Like Carcassonne this game is FUN in a box. However, particularly with two players there is not as much competition for routes so can lead to lots of early turns in which people are drawing cards and getting huge hand sizes.  This is solved by playing with expansion boards.

Almost everyone I introduce this to wants to play it again. Quick, almost no down time, just about enough luck to keep things interesting. Beautiful components and works well with 3-5 players (not a huge fan with 2).

More strategic than the original USA version IMHO and better cards too.

RATING: 7
A big base box, a great map (IMO more balanced than the USA map) and a fun game to boot. It comes with normal sized train cards as opposed to the hobbit sized ones for the USA version.

It comes with a few added rules for the map but I often consider the placing 'stations' rule, to let you use other people's routes, to be fairly optional. Removing these makes for a much more cutthroat game :)

I don't like this as much as the America or Switzerland maps.  The consequences to poor play are not very severe.  It is not as easy to teach as America and has more randomness (tunnels) than America.  It also has the same problem as the America game, in that there is a huge card drawing phase in the beginning, followed by a rush to build at the end.  I like the Swiss map more, since there is an urgent need to build in the early stages of the game.

This is about the easiest 'real' game to introduce to non-gamers I have found. The only problem some of them have is with European geography (and this includes some Europeans). I took this on a ski trip with me and had people fighting for slots in the game after they had played once. Now if I could just stop my 6-year-old from taping the train pieces together and using in his rail dioramas...

Ticket to Ride with probably a better balanced map and a few more mechanics to spice things up. Although I think the train stations are better left out, as they rob the game's tension too much while rarely being used anyway.

RATING: 4
First play: Its many years since I last played TtR and as i was reminded of the rules I remember why I traded it after that last game. This is a very light family game. The card engine is so overpowering, you really are taken for a ride with little chance to steer the action. If you conicidentally draw routes which are similar to others you will struggle. Pick up routes isolated from the rest and you will breese through. Also linkable routes that fall in your lap and so will 10 points for the longets route.

At its most demeaning this is a very childish game will little scope for applied skill, just pray the right cards come up for you and the wrong ones for everyone else. Not to be played again.

I keep hearing how this one is the worst of the series. I couldn't disagree more. I like the challange of the ferries and tunnels. I also like the map and it's crazy routes. I also like having one long route to form your strategy for the game, then smaller routes to branch off. It plays differently than the others. A good, unique addition to the series.

Wow.  I expected just another rail building game when opening this.  But what we got was much more.  I didn't play the original but this one is a very fast paced highly strategic collecting game.  I'm not sure any persons turn lasted longer than 4 seconds, and if it did they were yelled at.  If you like thinking on your feet get this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Greatly improved version of Ticket to Ride. This time, every player is guaranteed one long ticket worth around 20 points. Additionally, each player has train depots which allow a player to count someone else's trains entering or leaving a city as their own, but only when determining whether a destination ticket is complete. 

The cards are now full sized, which greatly improves upon the original experience. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have modified the game so that players can choose the order in which they can pick up the next round of revealed cards, and that order determines the order the players pick the following round.  The players always see two rounds of cards before they pick the order so that they can make a more informed decision.

This is a fine version of TTR, but the more I play the original the more I like it compared to this version.  The tunnels are too random and the lack of longer routes between cities (like the original) I believe are marks against it.  At the end of the day as an American it is simply more fun to play on the familiar map, it is so hard to know where cities are when the native languages are used in this version.  Give me USA.

Great game for the whole family.  Usually takes about 60-90 minutes to play.  Game turns are fast  which keeps everyone involved.  Good mix of strategy and luck.  Plays well with all ages and is easy to learn.  Have played with 2-3 players, but feel 4 is probably the best number to play this game.
 The only thing that makes things a little more difficult is that the cities are written in their language so difficult to read a lot of the city names (takes a little while to learn).

Excellent game. Good as a gateway, but equally good for regular gamers. I prefer this version to the US version as tunnels and stations add an interesting dimension. Stations make the game less infuriating if your route gets cut off.

This seems the most family-friendly version, as the stations generally prevent players from being completely blocked.

Good game, lots of depth...but sadly it's in that no-man's land between "comes out for newbies" and "heavy enough for gamers".

01-02-11: Not a bad game, but I didn't have a moment in playing a 4-player regular game with just the 19 additional routes for the 1912 where I was even a little bit mad, or even disappointed.  

I think this game is probably the worst of the series if you're playing with people who are nice to you.  If you can leave a two-spot wildcard open that you're clearly trying to get, and not have it filled by someone jerking you around...this is not the game to play.  You have so very many options available to you, if you don't work against eachother to exhaust those options, this game becomes a good example of virtual multiplayer solitaire.  

At least with the other games, there was contention, even if it's accidental.

I only played this once, and I recorded that play on the USA version. There are few differences but I think I'd enjoy them more if I had already been an experienced TtR player. Anyway, my thoughts:

-Ferries: Ok. Add a bit more difficulty and decisions to the game.

-Tunels: Meh. Adds more press-your-luck to a game that already had enough for my tastes (in the sense that every time you're not building you're pressing your luck that others do not claim your route), as you have to either have enough cards on the color you're building to counter the possible cards you're digging (which is like making the same route but 3 pieces longer) or build ahead and hope those cards don't show up.

-Stations: I don't really like pieces that twist the rules of the game to make it "easier" (Another one beingthe Abbey in Carcassonne, for example).

Overall, I think I'd rather play the original TtR.

Last note: The geography in this map is quite fucked up, really. I understand it's needed to make the routes the way they are, but that doesn't mean I have to like it...

Bought this game from a great hobby store (now out of business) at the height of the game's popularity.  It is still one of the two highest BGG rated game I own (hope to change that soon) but I like other games better.  The theme aspect is overpowered by the competition and strategic element for me.  Plus, the geography is useful only if studying history or traveling back in time.

This game is so simple to play, and yet keeps the tension high the whole time.  I really enjoy the addition of the long and the short tickets.  I think this is a great way to help keep the scores even, as you can't complain that you only got short ticket cards, as could happen in the original.  I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of tunnels or ferries, but they definately keep the game fresh from the original.

The best in the series (IMHO). Less cut throat than the other games in the series. Additional features add more thought while not bogging the game down. Just brilliant. 

My rating is for the four-player game, which I believe is the sweet spot for the game. Four players is less claustrophobic and gives a great deal of variety in the game play that I feel is a little absent from the three- and five-player games. Two player can be quite interesting, giving players a similar level of freedom to the four-player game.

I'm not crazy about the changes to the original.  The ferries are the only thing I enjoy.  The stations seem to ruin the point of the game (snap up routes early vs. hoard cards), the tunnels actually penalize you even further for going for smaller routes (the points system penalized this already), and separating the long routes from the short in the shuffle sounds good in theory, but there just aren't enough different long routes.  It's build on the back of a great game, so there's only so bad it can be really, but this does not stack up to the original in my eyes.

Ticket to Ride: Europe (2005) 		7.5  -7
I find Ticket to Ride is the perfect gateway game for non-gamers, since it’s easy to learn, plays smoothly and in the end it even feels like playing a bigger or harder game as it constantly requires the players to make relevant decisions and overcome new obstacles: its mix of simplicity and complexity is enough for me to make it one of the best games to play with anyone, no matter how much «gamers» they are.

This Europe edition though, which essentially is the same as the original game, simply adds a new map and a couple of new rules that don’t change the gameplay heavily but bring in an unnecessary layer of difficulty. [i](April 2014)[/i]

[b]Update [/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a handful of games and Ticket to Ride Europe isn’t one of them: thus I rounded down my rating from 7,5 to 7.

This one is more balanced and forgiving, due to the more balanced routes and the opportunity to use stations.  The tunnels make it a bit more random.

This all adds up to a more family friendly version of Ticket to Ride - which means my mother and wife will play it!  Any game that I can play with family  and still has some decent strategy is a great game.

And of course it has a cool map - and don't forget the trains!

Our family metagame for all TTR games is fairly nonconfrontational -- aggressive blocking (as opposed to incidental blocking) is stigmatized. This allows me, for most of the other TTR games, to have a preferred route that covers a good spread of tickets. Europe's ticket distribution doesn't allow this as much as US/Nordic/Swiss, which results in a more competitive game for all involved.

Get a 6th train set w/ train stations. In a 6 player game you just divide the 225 trains by 6 players, so each player gets 37 train tokens. How can you do this? Take 8 of each color and set them aside.

Plays just like it's predecessor, Ticket to Ride. The addition of stations and tunnels will offer fans a couple neat new twists to flesh out the strategy in the system. Perhaps I'm missing something (such as how to make the best use of engine cards, for example), but the games leave little impression on me after a session with them. I never quite feel that I was engaged in a close contest. For the effort, I'd rather play TransAmerica.

First impression: Funny!. The board full of trains is beautiful, the game is easy to learn. Perfect to pull non gamers into something heavier.

Focusing in the game, it can be a little to much long (90 minutes) but you don't get boring during the game. Altough, I think the game has been overrated by many people, there are much better, and less expensive, introduction to boardgames. For example, Ingenious or Cartagena.

Added this to the collection at my wife's suggestion.
Interesting take on area control and resource management.  And the big plus for her is "you can still play it when you're hammered!"

I like it, but it's a bit too simplistic if I'm in a gaming mood.  I'll play it, but I'd probably suggest something with a little more strategy involved.

UPDATE JAN 2013 : Having put the Android version on my phone - it's my go to time killer.  I've discovered the deeper levels of strategy that this game has to offer.

Like the original, it's a decent family game that offers some chances for strategic play.  Full-sized cards are a nice change from original.  It's possible to get really hosed by the tunnels.  Station houses are a good way to keep long-haul tickets alive when you get cut off.  IIRC, there aren't many long routes, and the focus is on completing extra tickets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really good light game this.  There is enough strategy to satisfy those that need it and the rules are simple enough for it to serve as an introduction to 'Euro' games.  With three or more players it can be tense too as tracks start to get used up and you are trying to make a particular route.  Deciding whether or not to take another route can be the key to winning (or losing badly!).

Another train game, but unlike the others I know, this one doesw not involve any goods shipping, it's just about building routes. Route objectives are handed out initially on cards and you can take more cards whenever you like. An interesting concept!

The card collecting mechanism used for building the routes across Europe is is pretty engaging and if you know the routes, then you can guess where your opponents are going. Blocking others and progresing yourself is part of the game.

I'd say this is worth a few plays. I've only played this and Ticket to Ride once, and rated Ticket to Ride slightly hiher just for the simplicity. I don't think tunnels add and game value here, just frustration, though stations are a nice idea. The ridiculous tunnel from Scandinavia to Russia is eye opener and on the whole the board just looks and plays more menacingly that the U.S. board of the original. For now I'd be a "stick with the original" player.

Playing TTR: Europe was quite refreshing after playing TTR to death. While I did find some of the new rules to be interesting, I thought they distracted a bit from the simplicity of the original TTR design, so I'm ranking this one point lower than the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Ticket to Ride series is essentially a Rummy variant with a spacial element.  However, the spacial element makes it substantially more complicated than traditional rummy, since it drives the colors and number of cards you need for each "meld", determines the scoring value of the melds, and acts as a game clock to determine when the game ends.  

This is an excellent game for casual or non gamers.  It is easily explained, and the strategy is not particularly complex.  The stations of the Europe variant make it more forgiving, and the tunnels and ferrys add some much needed value to the locomotive cards.  This is an excellent version to have on hand for when you want to pull out a game with visitors who do not usually game, or who are card gamers.  

Ticket to Ride does not have much depth to it, and the Europe version is particularly shallow, in that there are only 3 "big" routes - 1 8 train, and 2 6 train.  These are worth so many points that if one player grabs 2 of them, that player will likely win.  This is unthematic and a little disappointing, because it pulls the focus off building tickets and makes it a race to large numbers of the same color card.  However, the game is relatively quick to play (45-60 minutes with 4), and is good light fun. 

This game is also appropriate for young children, especially boys who are fascinated with trains.  I have found that my 5 year old can play competently with a little help.  The basic decisions (which color cards to take, when to take tickets) are good for teaching thinking ahead and basic strategy. 

Overall, I would probably not ever request TTR:E, but there are many situations that it is right for, and it has definitely earned its spot in my collection.

Ticket to Ride is always fun, and it's easy to teach our non-gaming friends how to play.  We bought the Europe version after playing the US version.  The addition of tunnels adds the element of chance, and the addition of stations gives you options when things get tight in Central Europe.

This is a step up from the original TtR game with regard to options, but strategy is about equivalent. There are more railroads to claim on this board, so one must be careful to cover all destinations or lose points.

Ticket to Ride is the modern equivalent to Monopoly - a must-have game, that anyone can pick up & play within minutes.

My only gripe about the game though, is its cheap plastic train pieces.  I'd gladly pay more for wood components.

3-4P Quoting Tom Vasel: "Ticket to Ride Europe may be a derivative of the first game, but it's certainly good enough to stand on its own ground; and owners of the first game can be assured that they are getting their money's worth when purchasing this version. When choosing an hour or less game that accommodates up to five people (with a two-person game playing equally as well), there are almost no other games I would prefer over this one. Alan Moon has struck gold with this series; and if TtR Europe is any indication, each game will continually get better!"
Lost my copy in 2014, looking for another.

An improvement on the base game, additional options and a tighter board and more tense building options offered by the ferry routes and tunnels, for example. Makes the game much more engaging, without losing the gateway/family feel of the original game.

With one group of players we decided to double the objectives' value in order to discourage playing for long roads that block other people's objectives.

Still, one of the classics, and I'd be ready to play it at almost any time. I would like to try some of the other variants (only played Nordic Countries once, haven't yet tried Märklin or Switzerland).

Llevaba tiempo buscándolo y una vez probado es un acierto. Mi juego favorito de introducción para grupos de 4-5, con 3 dudaría entre este y el Carcassone. El juego es lo que debería ser un juego de éxito (de ahí el éxito del mismo) se explica en 10 minutos y en la segunda partida ya estás listos para luchar en igualdad de condiciones con cualquiera. Por ahora me ha funcionado muy bien para introducir al juego y se nota la tensión según avanza la partida. En resumen un imprescindible en cualquier ludoteca. Y en mi caso tengo bastante claro que mas temprano que tarde añadirá alguna expasión o versión.

I don't own this, but rather gifted it to a couple we semi-regular play with. I like much than the original. The killer/winner routes no longer exist. There is actual competition for routes throughout the game and the addition of the little house-thingie makes for some additional strategic thinking. Given all of that, the original in it's simplicity may still be the better gateway game.

The tunnels, ferries, stations, and layout make this variation more challenging than the already awesome original.

Where the original is my favorite game to play with new people, this game is great when I want something with more depth.

RATING: 8
Better than the original in nearly every aspect.  One long ticket   choose shorter tickets solves the long route problem.  The lack of the long track segments of the original removes that problem and evens the game out with those who must build more shorter routes.  It is now a necessity to get wild cards - you can't just draw random cards every time as you will get hosed without the wild cards as they are needed so badly for some routes and for tunnel flexibility.  The cards are bigger so my thumb doesn't get all cramped up.  Honestly why would I go back to the original after playing this?  Version 2.0 is much better!

If you like Ticket to Ride but you wished it could be a little bit friendlier, Europe is the way to go. While tunnels do cause some frustration at times, the addition of stations makes Europe a much more friendly game than the USA original. Also, the European map looks far more beautiful than the base USA map.

RATING: 7.5
Not as good as Märkin or the U.S. but a good map nonetheless. Unless we play four-player we don't usually play with the train stations, because they make things a little too easy. I'd love to see a way to combine boards to make a "mega map" of all continents with tunnels, ferries, and mountains combined (maybe bridges as well?) to make things more interesting. Or an expansion with "special event" cards like strikes, natural disasters, bonuses and penalties to add an unpredictable risk factor not present in the current game.

Initially I enjoyed the game, but after repeated plays I found the luck of the draw for the tunnels adds more randomness to a game that doesn't need it.  The stations are a "friendly" addition, but remove one of the more interesting elements of TtR: blocking out your opponents.  I won't be playing TtR:E any more.  TtR and TtR:M are superior.

I really wanted to like this game but I am  unable to bear playing it more than once in a sitting. The level of interaction just isn't high enough, and the competition doesn't feel real. The mechanics, quality of components, and ease of teaching it to new gamers puts it at a 7, though.

Like the original, this game is fun and easy to teach.  The extra elements added here and the wide open map make the game a little less vicious, and a little more strategic.  The cost is that it's slightly more complicated to teach and that it might not scratch the right itch if you're in the mood for something with more pvp action.

A more interesting map layout than the original, with tunnels and ferries instead of lots of long routes.

RATING: 7.5
I think I like it the best in the series, but we certainly play the original much, much more. It has a bit more to it with the tunnels, ferrys and train stations. However, it does not feel as though it will have the replayability of the original. Or perhaps even of Marklin. The Marklin edition, for me, feels a bit too fiddly for what you get. Ultimately, if more maps can be published with the TTR-Europe mechanics, it may solidify this as my favorite.
I had a theory after playing 3 or 4 times that if you don't get the 8-train tunnel you've lost the game. Even if it wasn't on your route. Although it makes it more difficult to win, it's certainly not impossible. So, that theory goes out the window.  :-)

Ticket To Ride: Europe is another sequel to the antique Ticket To Ride. Developed and published later in 2005, this game can still be found on the shelf in every retailer and board game shop. I would say that this game is quite fun, with high replayability, but it would be boring after several repetitions. There are several expansions available and it would be beneficial to have them since the core game would not last long to sustain your fun. The pile of cards is huge and you actually spend most of your time shuffling it because it is very thick, indeed. This classic game is still something to be considered. Even I am considering to repurchase one.

UPDATE: See my comments about Ticket to Ride. The "problems" in TtR that TtR:Europe is trying to "fix" are too fundamental, and TtR:E is trying to fix them with band-aids rather than going after the root of the problem. To quickly summarize: the problem is that the rewards for completing tickets are not properly scaled. Long routes are cheaper and easier to build, and also worth more points. A ticket that requires a tunnel or ferry to complete, which is much more costly to build than an equivalent route with no such required added costs, is worth the same points. The solution to TtR's problems is to fix the math so that risks are more fairly rewarded, not TtR:E's flurry of band-aids and chrome.
---
Basically, I think about the same of TtR:Europe as I do of TtR, with the exception that TtR:E has much, much superior components. The new additions make an attempt to address the significant balance issue of the original, that being the weakness of the tickets in general, and thus the overpowering strength of getting one of the few good, high-point ones. The attempt is largely unsuccessful, though, because it ignores the fundamental underlying problem: the points you get from a route are at best peripherally related to the difficulty of completing that route. So again, the most important skills here are a) drawing good tickets, and b) realizing that tickets are generally a sucker play.

My previous concerns about the pressure on the wild cards resulting in jammed-up games appears to have been overblown. TtR:E does have a bit more arbitrary screwage than TtR because of the 8-length generic-color tunnel route, which can have one player sitting on a huge percentage of one color for a good chunk of the game, thus screwing you if you really, really need that color. It's not a hugely significant factor, but it's frustrating when it occurs.

After a recent play of TtR:E I think I finally became disillusioned with this system. Sure, it works, it's simple, there is some tension in the choices, but the game is just so boring, so lacking in any excitement at all or interesting player interaction, and so lucky.

Okay, I enjoy playing this game.  I'll admit it.  However, at least in a game with fewer players, there seems to be an endless amount of ways to score points and it comes down to who can compete for the longer connections.  Fun anyway, and light.  And for what it is, intense.  Just don't dote too long on it and you'll have fun.  Isn't that what matters?

Update:  with a full complement of five players, I like this game a little better.  It makes the competition a little fiercer due to the crowding on the board.

I like the original a lot better.  TTR:Europe is basically just TTR for wusses.  The introduction of train stations to the game removes all of the tense moments of the original TTR by providing an easy way out if your route gets blocked.  Screwage through route blocking was my favorite part of TTR, and now it's near impossible!  Boo!  DOW is just trying to milk more cash from their cow with this title.

Sequel to the very popular Ticket to Ride that introduces a few kinks to make the game a bit different from its predecessor. The ferries and tunnels are a nice addition, but I wasn't a big fan of the stations. Makes it too easy to complete routes while the original was a bit more cutthroat. Despite that, it's a fantastic gateway game and great introduction to the Ticket to Ride series.

We played this game with Andrew's kids (6 and 4). It worked - the four-year-old got the game pretty quickly. The only downside was that the game took two hours - mostly because I was dragging it out to get the eight-train tunnel, instead of just ending the game.

I noticed they also took tickets a lot more often than I did - and only took one at a time. While one of the kids was choosing a ticket, the game effectively stopped. I started taking my turn while they were still deciding, and I think that sped up the game, too, but I could understand why the kids might need help choosing tickets.

I think that if Andrew and Christine play the game more, they can race to finish, and it'll be closer to the 60-minute playtime listed on the box.

RATING: 5
Like the original, the production quality is great, the rules are simple but offer lots of opportunities to make decisions, and it's just the right length. The only issue I really have with it are the addition of train stations. They make it much harder to screw over your opponents, thus decreasing the interaction (or at least, the players' effect on each other.) The tunnels and ferries make luck of the draw more important, but also mix things up a little to give you some nice variation.

RATING: 7
This is probably my least favorite version in the Ticket to Ride series but I will of course still play if asked. The reason why I don't like it as much as the others is that it's not good with 2 (and probably 3 too) players as it's just too hard to block because of the big map which isn't connected in a clever way, so you end up playing almost solitare games (okay, might be exaggerating a but, but that's how I feel compared to TtR USA for instance). Also, it's too easy to tell which long ticket a player has kept after just a few rounds and I think the stations detracts from the tension as you can often put a station down if you are blocked from where you need to go.

RATING: 6
A fun 'gateway' game. The stations make long routes significantly easier. Intersecting/shared routes on your ticket cards play a large part in who wins.

1st play was okay... love the original so much that I will need many more plays to get the feel for this one. In fact, this version made me increase my love for the original design even more. Doesn't touch the elegance and speed of the original. More gamer? Whatever, less smooth. 

The idea of using stations repulses me. Either get to the city or don't.

I never play this. My least favorite Ticket to Ride version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I prefer the original; despite the added bells & whistles here, the other game seems more intense to me.  Maybe having the stations makes it too easy to make your connections, I don't know. (That certainly didn't help me last time I played...)Added later: This one's gone up in my estimation.  I really enjoy the whole TTR series as an excellent blend of push-your-luck, strategic planning, and tactical adjustments at a fairly light level.

My criterion for rating games


 http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder:  This game is very samey and feels the same every time I play it. The only differences are in the routes you draw.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  This game has quite a few meaningful decisions to be made. At the beginning, I like that this one has a guaranteed long route that you can choose to keep or not. Throughout the game which way to go on the map, which cards to take, when to draw tickets, and what tickets to keep make this one have a good bit more decision making that the original TTR.

3) Player interaction:  It does have a bit of interaction on the board as players try to avoid getting blocked and figure out work arounds when they do get blocked.

4) Components/artwork: Fantastic artwork, minis and cards. Days of wonder's usual great work.

5) Game length/complexity:  Great length of game and complexity. Easy to get players playing quick and still some good strategy and tactics to keep the game entertaining.



Bottom line: This game has some fun to it. I like it better than the original Ticket to ride as I feel it has more decisions in having the long ticket at the beginning. Also a little less luck as you could draw two long tickets in the original that are close together and then you have a big advantage.

Not my favorite of the TtR series.  I don't like the map very much, the tunnels are annoying (and can ruin plans due to complete randomness), and the station mechanic essentially lets you cheat.  This game essentially strips away the difficult stuff found in the base game (and Marklin) and dumbs it down, but adds the ridiculous tunnel mechanic.  Blech!

I had only played the regular Ticket to Ride once when I played this.  More complicated and some of the strategy changes.  

I will say that I don't think that non-gamers (those who are not heavily into board games) should play this over the regular Ticket to Ride, as the extra complexity is not worth the added "learing curve" to figure out how to win.  This is better for those already playing games.

RATING: 9
Love this after the first play - Was a big hit among all four first time players. Also easy to learn and teach, but there is a good depth here and a lot of thinking. I noted that it is difficult to plan ahead while other people are making their moves, since the face-up draw cards and available routes will sometimes change quickly. I spent a lot of my downtime studying the map to find alternative routes in case my best route was blocked. Similar game mechanic (color cards for claim management) to Web of Power and China, but plays very differently. 

[i]Quality complaints for Days of Wonder version:[/i]  Hollow plastic train pieces feel very cheap - wish they were better quality. The train piece colors aren't so great. The red we recieved is a bit more on the pink or salmon side of the red scale instead of a nice deep [-]fire truck[/-] caboose red. Storage cubby is beautifully roomy and DoW was thoughtful enough to include some spare train pieces of each color (seperately bundled) just in case some go missing.  Good quality cards, although I think it was a major error to make the train card backs blue - almost the same color blue as the blue train card faces, making it hard to spot blue cards that are flipped over in the deck.

Played with my wife who loves the game. The game is a winner due to its simplicity for me, easy to teach to people with no especial interest in board games. Played it with four players a couple of times and it is real fun then. One to keep until the kids are old enough to play games.

I like the mechanics, and the element of luck with the cards/routes. Would liked to have seen more long routes as after several plays you can guess the longer routes and maybe even try and block them if you're a nasty player.

Overall a great gateway game as has been said by many others, and it is easy to pick up and play in an hour or less.

I will probably not order it, since I own the america version. This version adds little twists, but overall playing experience is the same.

This is a perfect game to introduce newbies to eurogames, before moving to other favourites like Yspahan, Power Grid, or Puerto Rico, since it is very simple, very easy and fast to teach, and very addictive.

Only drawback is shelf life and simplicity: I much prefer "heavier" games, and usually leave the Ticket to Ride series for casual play with newbies.

I was surprised that despite the new rules this felt like the same old Ticket to Ride to me. On this board there is a crunch point at the middle of the board around Germany that leads to players blocking each other a lot. This is solved by having the stations. I did feel that this crunch point did mean that a lot of people were out of the running for longest track half way through the game which I thought wasn't so good. If I were to buy a copy I think I would buy the original. I think the extra rules don't add much and just double the time it takes to explain the rules.

Local game shop owner recommended Europe instead of USA because of the new rules. The geography is harder for new players, and the rules are more confusing with tunnels and stations, but if I can get them past that sticking point, I think it's a better game for my family. The USA version looks like it would end up too adversarial and backstabby and a child might end up crying. The youngest one loves putting the trains on the tracks.

Expands Ticket to Ride with tunnels, stations, ferrys and long vs. short ticket separation.  Ferrys didn't work due to bad luck in one game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
On the plus side, this game is easy to learn AND master. It is also fast-paced, since player turns are usually very short.

There is an element of luck and it is possible to ruin other players' game by picking on them, especially if you are able to determine what route a player is trying to complete.

This means you really need to make sure your player group does not contain both hardcore game-wreckers and people who like to be able to play their own game without too much negative interaction between players, or the game will become very frustrating and could easily result in 'softer' players thinking badly of it.

When playing with two players, there may be a LACK of interaction that makes the game a luck-fest since the player with the most appropriate destination cards will win, often with an impressive difference in scores.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I think the map works better than the US one because there are fewer 6-train routes and players might have to fight each other more for space. However I think the addition of stations takes away some of the suspense. The swiss map might be my best bet. (10+ plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like the new map and how it plays, but the new rules don't really add to the gameplay.  The tunnels and ferries are ok, but I think the cost of stations are too low and don't penalize bad play enough.  

In regard to introducing gaming newbies,  it is a little below regular Ticket to Ride due to both the extra rules and a lesser amount of familiarity with European geography.

I like this game over the original Ticket to Ride for two reasons:
1) Tunnels and Bridges make it worthwhile to spend a turn picking up a face-up locomotive.
2) The train stations make it easier for someone to recover from being cut off.  It will still cost them a turn, a card, and 4 victory points, but it's not game ending.

People say this game is a great introduction to board gaming and they are right. I always loved the idea of board games and didn't realise that this whole other world of 'boutique' board games existed. I stumbled upon this when trying to buy mexican train dominoes online (in NZ) and after looking at reviews (on BGG) I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas 2010. We played it and loved it.

We have played it with different groups of people (who aren't gamers) and it has gone down pretty well every time, and is often requested. Even my MUM loves this game.

I have played both Europe and USA and i prefer the variety of types of routes in Europe (tunnels, ferries, the long long train). USA is simpler to teach to new players (absence of tunnels and ferries and stations) but Europe is kinder to them (due to stations).

When we play Europe as a two player game, we remove the destination tickets that are on the eastern-most side of the board but we can build there if we want (but no tickets will go there). This makes the board much tighter and adds more tension to a two player game.

Once you learn the US version, you'll love this Europe version and stick with it instead. The big cards are easier to handle, and you are guaranteed a long ticket in the beginning instead of being stuck with dinky tickets. 
The tunnels add a cool wrinkle to the game, while the train stations virtually eliminate a lot of the blocking that frustrates both experienced and inexperienced gamers. Plus, there are significantly fewer long five and six long tracks, tracks that imbalance the game because they earn the player so many more points than smaller tracks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Ticket to Ride is a simple, accessible and tremendous amount of fun. Despite the semblance of such a dull theme, the satisfaction of secretly completing destinations and the imminent threat of opposing conductors taking your intended railway leads to many hi-jinx in the high-stakes laying of track across the old-timey European landscape.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
Adds risk taking (tunnels cause routes to potentially cost more cards to complete and if you can't do it or refuse to complete the route you lose a turn), bail outs if you get blocked off (at a cost in victory points), and routes that require locomotives to complete (ferries) to the original Ticket to Ride: America.  The game plays a bit slower, but has more depth and variety to it than the original.

I'm not sure the tunnels are my favourite part of the game, but the stations and their interplay with the competitiveness element inherent in having fewer double routes makes the game more interesting than the original.

I've kind of been avoiding this game because of all the hype but I have finally been sucked in. While I haven't become completely infatuated with it, it is a very good and fun game. I was more willing to play this version than the original. Everybody should at least try it. I was a skeptic, but I have to give credit where it's due. I put it on my want list after one play and now own it!!As a sidenote: The time on this says 30min. I don't find that very accurate. Closer to an hour per game, more depending on the number of people and who they are.

Chyba najczęściej polecana gra na początek obok Catanu. Jest wystarczająco łatwa, żeby wprowadzić w nią nowych graczy w każdym wieku, zarówno dzieci jak i osoby starsze, tematyka jest na tyle uniwersalna, że nikt na wstępie nie odrzuca z tego powodu gry, zdobyła popularność na całym świecie, o czym świadczy liczba nowych map i dodatków. Rozgrywka jest prosta, w zależności od liczby graczy trwa 1-2 godziny, ale wymaga pewnej strategii odnośnie wyboru i realizacji tras, pojawia się nieco negatywnej interakcji w blokowaniu innym tras, którymi sami jedziemy, a także losowość w pociąganiu nowych kart. Idealna nowoczesna gra planszowa dla wprowadzenia nowych geeków, a doświadczeni gracze również nie będą się przy niej nudzić. Żeby zniwelować tłok na środku planszy fajnie sprawdzają się dworce.

Better than the basic game, but starting from such a low base line it's almost bound to.

Hands down the better thought out game of the series.  Makes playing ticket to ride with max players an enjoyable venture, versus a gaming experience that results in people cursing their minds out.  The addition of the train stations allows casual and experienced gamer compete for the same routes, without feeling sour for being cut off and resulting in less abandoned games or conversions to chaotic players because of knowing they are out of the game.  Experienced gamers who like the original over this, are the same who memorize games & plays and play to dominate their opponents to prove some superiority complex.  This game is more balanced and a fun experience for all.

9.10.11 My favorite version of TtR. This game plays very similar to the original but offers a few changes to keep things interesting. My favorite is Train Stations. I very rarely use these but in the odd chance you become blocked you can drop one of these stations to use another players track from that city to complete a ticket only (do no use for longest route). Next you have fairies and tunnels. Fairies require wilds and Tunnels might cost you 1-3 more of the color then expected. The only complaint is people don't know Europe as well as they know USA so they complain trying to find their cities.

RATING: 8.4
A lean, tight map that makes the U.S. map look like a walk in the park.  The lack of many double routes (and the added challenge of tunnels and ferries) makes it even tougher.

This is mitigated somewhat by the use of "stations" which allow you to ride on someone else's route that has been laid down.  But will someone actually cover the one you want?

Seems like this could be quite enjoyable with two players, but with four or more it's unnecessarily frustrating.  That being said, any Ticket to Ride map is always going to be something I'd like to play.

And my daughter loves the cute trains. Some day, when she's be able to play it, she'll learn some geography via this game.

My wife really likes this one. Whenever I say, let's play a game, this is the only one she wants to play!

As for me, well it's fine, but I often feel like you're more playing each your own game, rather than one game together, as there is not much interaction between players. I also find that the scoring is a bit poor, and gets in the way of the game.

Other than that, I recommend this game, and easy for non-gamers to enjoy.

RATING: 8
A solid game. After playing USA online for months the Europe map takes some getting used to, but it is well balanced. The components are easy to handle and the cards have a nice weight to them.
Probably the best thing about this game is the fact that you can play is like USA by ignoring the ferries and tunnels, or you can add in those special routes and stations. Doing this you can take this game from a simple gateway game and let it grow with the players into something with more complexity.

RATING: 8
Production: Exceptional Days of Wonder production value, as always.  I like that the cards are full size.  Play: The map is more congested, with many routes that make a bend halfway through, which I find unattractive.  Because I'm not as familiar with European cities, I find the ticket destinations more difficult to locate than for the US version.  There are fewer long connections, which I miss from the original.  The four rules changes don't appeal to me.  Ensuring that each player is dealt a long route ticket is important for balance, but in the original I never felt that my bad luck with tickets was controlling my game.  The stations make the game slightly less cutthroat, and therefore less tense.  I find that tunnels and required locomotives make their respective routes too difficult. (3+2+3) (3 plays)

One of my two favourite "gateway" games to introduce people to boardgaming (along with Settlers of Catan), and a simple, yet brilliant casual game for more experienced gamers. 

There is a small degree of "screwage" possible when players deliberately block routes you might need. Simple to understand scoring mechanism though helps newbies understand the game, and players mentally keep track of what's going on.

Simpler than Alan R. Moon's other brilliant game, Airlines Europe, though with a focus on one's own routes (unlike the stock-driven Airlines Europe) I think the TtR series is the one that provides a bit more "fun" overall for a larger range of gamers.

It remains one of my favourite "entry" games, however, and has been played at least 20 times more than shown.

Tried this (borrowed it for a few weeks from a friend) but we didn't like it as much as the original (with 1910 added).  The stations were OK, but seemed a bit like a get out of jail free card.  More of a problem was the predictability of the major route that everyone was likely to be trying for.  The one big card plus small ones initial distribution seemed like a neat idea at first, but made things more predictable in play (at least for us).

I credit this game for being the game to teach me that I'm not a big fan of euro-style games and much prefer games with more player interaction.

It's a fine game it's just not for me.

Once we bored a bit of the US version, we got TTR Europe.  There's a huge difference IMO between these.  It is far more even and challenging to win in TTR-E.  I like the idea of the ferry routes, but I don't really dig on the tunnel rules that much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a good game. Maybe too simple, but there is some amount strategy in it. I do recommend it with 1912 expansion, because it makes endgame part quicker thanks to depot cards. And also I very much like the mega europe tickets variant which gives enough chaos and randomness to the game.
Drawback to me is the simplicity of the game, but with enough tickets you can somewhat correct that.
Very good aspect of the game is that there is very little downtime, even with 5 players, except when you have to shuffle traincards.

2-5 players, 45-60 minutes, light medium, trains

I've always enjoyed trains and games that involve trains and/or pick-up-and-deliver. So when I discovered Ticket to Ride a few years ago and learned how popular it was, I really wanted to get my hands on a copy.

TtR is a really fun game, easy to explain and easy to play. The game looks very appealing and the rules are quite simple. The game is very suitable for non-gamers as well and can be considered a so called gateway game. You can set up and explain the game in just a few minutes, so that's most welcome when playing with non-gamers.

I've played a dozen games with 2-5 players and all work quite well. As the map is rather large, 4-5 players is probably best, otherwise you will probably stay out of each others' way for the majority of the game. The game really shines when all players are actually competing to finish some central lines in order to complete their tickets. However, if someone beats you to it, you could still use the stations to "borrow" someone elses track, which makes TTR:Europe more forgiving than the original TTR. 

Although some people complain they make the game too easy, but I tend to disagree. They can in fact prevent someone from playing a lost game early on, so I think these really add something to the game.

There is a luck factor involved, as you're dependent on the cards you draw, but in the end strategy should pay out. Same goes for the tunnels, which are a unique feature of the European maps. When you want to complete a tunnel, then you have to draw 3 additional cards and if these match the colour of the tunnel, then you need to "pay" additional wagons (or locomotives) otherwise you can't complete the tunnel.

I'm a fan of this game and like to play this again anytime! Next to this version, I also own the TtR 10th Anniversary Edition of the original US map, the Dutch map, the Swiss map and the Indian map. Europe still is one of my favourites though and definitely a keeper in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent new version of Ticket to Ride.  Keeps the same great gameplay of the original while adding enough new things to keep it fresh.  The great emphasis on tickets instead of longer routes also makes the game more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
It seemed to me, throughout the entire game, that there was very little interaction. The additions of train stations means you don't need to fear someone taking your desired route as much and though the game as a whole is an enjoyable shared activity, all the closed information and solo plans made it feel lacking in meaningful ways to interact.

There are obviously a lot of tactics to employ though, many of which I missed out on. For one, I kept drawing longer than I should have - I should have tried to just expand my route more (and maybe also prioritised grabbing the necessary routes a little higher - I didn't realise using train stations lost you 4 points excluding the points you'd gain for grabbing the route).

2008-05-28 5-> 7.1

I think the simplicity is great - keeping the game moving.

It's definitely possible to see where an opponent is heading and try to scupper their plans when competing. Though the stations make this less of a critical situation, the lost points (both for the station and for the potential points you would have gotten for the route) and card(s) keep it a factor.

There's a big advantage to being the player to cause the end of the game - or being able to use all your trains at the end - since unused trains are wasted points.

There's definitely less interaction than in some other games but there's enough going on to keep it interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Small changes from the base game, but a big improvement. I prefer the European board and find that tweaks to the gameplay all create a more interesting and balanced game.

Some people complain that stations "ruin" the game because blocking is less effective. Blocking is less effective, and can no longer cause someone to be out of the game very early on if they get blocked from key routes, but I don't consider that a bad thing. In most cases, using a station means you are giving up points and time, while failing to extend your route for the longest route award. That is usually punishment enough in my mind.

I consider this the best "main entry" for the Ticket to Ride series.

To be perfectly honest, I thought I was "above" Ticket to Ride.  Gateway games are too just easy, too bland, and not as fun as their more complex brethren.

Then PhunkyMonkey had us play his 10th Anniversary Edition Ticket to Ride, and I was honestly surprised at how good of a time our group had--including me!  Sure, the game is simple, with very few things to do each turn, but it is in that simplicity where the enjoyment lies.  There is low stress when making decisions, yet the decisions you make are still important and have consequences.

Sometimes playing a game that is low stress and just fun is worth your time, too.

Supposedly better than the original but I disagree.

Сыграл достаточное кол-во раз на iPad, живьем играли гораздо меньше. Мне не сильно нравится эта игра. На мой вкус в ней мало общения и взаимодействия, при этом партия достаточно длинная - игроки сидят за столом, тянут карты, строят маршруты. Да, иногда кто-то кого-то "запирает" или уводит нужный "вагон", но для меня такого интерактива маловато. Помимо этого, везение в игре немаловажно. Хотя, допускаю, что с опытом можно как-то нивелировать фактор рандома.

Another "easily accessible" game for my group, it always ends up frustrating someone, but everyone always has a good time.  Very easy to teach, I like the addition of "tunnels" and "train stations" in the Europe version of Ticket to Ride - it eases some of the hurt of another player blocking a much needed route.  I played the original TTR (U.S.A. Map), and I prefer TTR: Europe due to the additional rules - hence why I chose to add this to my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like the idea of tunnels in this version, but I hate stations. It takes away a lot of competitiveness of trying to get certain routes because the other player will just play 1, 2, or 3 cards instead of the 6 you played to cut them off or get that route. Granted, they wont get longest train, but most times I don't feel that is a factor anyways.

This is perhaps my favorite iteration of the TtR franchise. More depth than TtR America, less fiddly bits than TtR Germany and a couple of good add-ons to extend its use-life.

I suppose that to date I've played this 200 times or more, and am happy to play more. 

It's very good for introducing non-gamers to the gaming universe, is liked by a great many people, and plays reasonably quickly. 

The strategic depth is not all that great. Nevertheless, it's a really fun game.

Nice variant of the original game that fixes the long route issue from its parent game, and adds a couple of nice twists like tunnels and stations. Great for people who may be a little tired of the original.

However, I can understand the complaints regarding the tunnels for competitive players who enjoy blocking strategies. Here that doesn't really exist. Also, I think the one 8-length route that generates 21 points all by itself can be too crucial.

What I liked
* Easy to teach and play
* Appeals to gamers and non gamers
* Thought the theme would be dry, but enjoyed it
* Plays fast, little downtime
* The tunnels
* The map just feels more interesting than the USA map.
* Pieces come baged and with spare carrages!

What I didn't like
* Need to make sure the deck is VERY shuffled before starting each game.
* Game is all about efficiency, unfortunately luck plays a fairly big part in how efficiant you can be.

If experienced players are playing against beginners, they really should give some helpful advice about what to go for and strategy before the game starts otherwise there is a very big advantage to the experienced player.

* Some of the printing on the cards on my copy was dodgy :(

RATING: 8.2
You could call this a "definitive" edition for Ticket to Ride. It contains everything that the original contained (well, except the NA map, I guess), plus adds a few complicating factors- tunnels, ferries, and stations. The additions are much-welcomed, and make for a more varied playing experience. The components are great quality, and the board is beautiful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent sequel to the original. The stations and the new route layout are both welcome additions (although it is sometimes hard to find your potential destinations, if you are unfamiliar with European cities). I'm still undecided on what I think of the tunnels. I like the risk/reward element, but I haven't played this version enough yet to fully develop an opinion on this addition. It would have been nice if this map had just been included on the back of the original map like Power Grid did.

Excellent improvement on the original. Tunnels and ferries add some extra gameplay and the stations are good escape for unfortunate play. I also like the re-emphasis on fulfilling tickets that comes from fewer long links.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Thumbs up. The stations shift the emphasis from claiming long connections to completing destination tickets. You're more likely to take a flyer on drawing tickets when stations are available to help you complete them. I prefer this way of playing, as there's too much card hoarding when players are going after the long connections. The stations also limit the effectiveness of blocking --- a good thing or a bad thing depending on your style of play (good for me).

Alas, not all the news is good. I don't appreciate the tunnels in this or in any other expansion. On balance, the game is maybe slightly better than the original.

Ticket to Ride (TtR) is a great game to introduce people to the world of gaming. The core mechanism of collecting sets of matching colored cards to build tracks on the map is not difficult to understand. The hidden points of the tickets keep everyone engaged in the game until the final scoring.
There is luck in the game and I guess TtR isn't a game that is enjoyed by heavy gamers. But I guess, that there's also some room for skillful play in TtR. 
All in all, I just like to play this TtR from time to time as it is fun to watch your railway network grow and screw the plans of the other players.

Cute little set collection game with a twist. The tunnel rules seem a little more deep than the rest of the game, but on the whole, it's quite light. Loads of cards. Pieces and board are high quality. Cards seem flimsy and low quality. Fun to play, I intend to use it as a gateway game.

Players either draft rail car cards, play melds of these cards to connect cities together (and score points), or draw ticket cards (hidden agenda points).  Most points wins.  About 95% of the original game, with a few new rules for stations (use other players track [Transamerica]), tunnels (you may not build your track) and ferries (require locomotive cards).  Good points - looks great, you can play with the brain turned off and still win.  Bad points: still feels 30 minutes too long, too close to the original to warrant owning both, card stock is very thin.  Perhaps try the new rules in the parent game - very easy to do.  Will not be popular in Portugal ;-)

I've only played this once, but based on my plays of Nordic Countries, I feel comfortable rating this one about the same.  I like learning the European cities, and I like the bright colours and attractive map.  There is also a fair amount of strategy in deciding what to pursue. The mechanics are intuitive and easy to teach, and I'm looking forward to introducing this one to my family.

Update: We never seem to play this, my partner is not a big fan because with 4 or 5 players there is too much downtime between turns, when the turns should be simple and quick. She likes Nordic Countries with less players better.  Up for trade now.

Okay, this takes everything we liked about the original, and gives us a reason to want the wild cards, which is a good thing).  We still never really use the stations, as we seem to go for what we need.  I love the new full sized cards, and only complaint is that it seems like there's less cards of each color, the last 5 people game we played, I felt that whenever there was a color I needed, it was taken (and hoarded) by every one else before it got back to me.  We were all going for orange routes, and finally had to manover away from orange to get there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Idea:
Connect your cities effectively by railtracks. Try to gather lines that overlap eachother.

Mechanism:
Draw connectable lines and connect them by drawing colored 'train' cards. You need certain amount of colors to build track between two cities. Score more points from cities that are far apart.

to who:
Easy to learn, somewhat amusing but suffers from fact that there arent enough randomness in the lines. Specially 'long lines' are way too predictable. This is classic though.

This is my "ahhh, don't want to play anything too demanding right now" - kind of game. Just sit around and play this thingy. Take a card, take a card, take some more card, put down some train-thingies. Easy and pleasing to a brain in resting state. Although this experience can radically change when playing with five players and suddenly, everyone is starting to destroy your plans. 
I'm definitely not caught by the theme, it's more like a turn-off for me. The fact that the girl likes it is a plus.

TtR:E is in most respects a more-interesting and deeper version of Ticket to Ride. The stations mean arbitrary losses are less likely; the tunnels and ferries add additional considerations to train card acquisition; and players are guaranteed a long route and several short ones. It seems that the routes are more balanced over all, as well.

Here's the thing: Ticket to Ride has a serious problem in competitive play. Tickets aren't very valuable, and optimal play consists largely of playing long routes to end the game quickly. I'm insufficiently experienced with the European map to comment on whether the game "fixes" this, but my strong suspicion is that it doesn't.

Should this matter? I'm not sure. I know some would claim that this sort of problem doesn't matter; that a game has a way it should be played, and play outside of these bounds is the fault of the players, not of the game. It's a compelling view in some ways, but I find its interpretation impossible to pin down. Perhaps that's my fault, and not the fault of the viewpoint.

Ticket to Ride is a family game. It's not meant to be played optimally. One should play in the spirit of the thing, and one should recognize what that is. This spirit is maddeningly difficult to pin down, and unenforceable. I'm being a gamer, here, focusing on some kind of rule or clear method of enforcement. Perhaps, again, that's the wrong way to go about it.

How should I treat Ticket to Ride? I enjoy it as conventionally played just fine, but even ignoring potential exploits at higher levels of play, I couldn't say the game is much more than average. I still enjoy average games, and I enjoy the occasional round of Ticket to Ride: Europe. But that's really the most I can say.

Got this as a birthday present from my wife. First hobby board game that I got and I would say the one that got me into the hobby. We still play it regularly, I think that says everything that needs to be said about the game.

RATING: 8
 If you have the original there is no need to get this game.  Not a bad game, but the new rules don't make it better, they just make it different.  In fact the best thing about the new expansion is the larger cards.  My wife prefers this version, mainly because of the train stations.

If you own TTR no need to purchase TTRE.

RATING: 7
As good as the original with a few other mechanics thrown in.  I don't like all of the additions, but the ones I do like make up for it.  Stations are a great idea that make playing with the family less tense.

Stations and ferries are nice, but the map is just so much "nicer" than USA - it's way easier to carve out your own territory on the segmented Europe board than the tough square of North America. I might find Europe a lot cooler conceptually than the good ol' USA, but I much prefer the 
less cool board.

And tunnels are evil. EVIL.

Another great gateway game to initiate non gamers but i cant imagine ever sitting down to play this with my gaming group. My 65 year old mother in law plays and enjoys this with us which is a testament to how good it is as a family game. There are some interesting decisions to be made with regards to blocking other players but it never feels in the spirit of the game when your trying to be competitive. It's a nice way of spending some time with a certain kind of people and remains in my collection for that reason.

My favorite of the base Ticket to Ride games. I like the idea of tunnels and ferries and train stations.

You can play with a group of 2 to 5 people. You can play online at Days of Wonder or Game Central, again an AI, or others on Apple IoS systems.

Great family game. We always with play the 1912 expansion to Europe.

I've played this a few times now. It was fun, but there are plenty of other games that I'd rather play. This game (or the original) just doesn't draw me in for some reason. I own it, though, because it's an excellent game to play with my non-hardcore-gaming friends.

(Up from 6.5 base game)
Europe was the first expansion I got, and still one of the best.  Having stations in the game is an improvement, imo, as it gives you a way to recover from being blocked out of somewhere.  They're not free, and aren't something you want to be building if you can avoid it, but they are a good safety net.  
The separation between long and short routes is another welcome change.  No longer can someone draw NY-LA off the top when they already have a connection between Boston and San Diego.  All the tickets you draw later on are small to medium routes.  
Tunnels are a little more random than I'd like, but if you keep an extra wild back, you'll be fine most of the time.  But, there are still some times where you hit 3 matching cards and lose your turn.  The ferries also increase the value of wild cards, and make drawing them from the display more attractive.

More wormy short ways to complete tickets. Less opportunities for one-move score bombs, added difficult-to-complete routes (tunnels and ferries), extra options to reroute around blockages (stations let you piggyback on another player's route, but at a cost in points).

I do like it a lot, but still like the original version a shade more..!

We like the fact that this version is a bit more forgiving than the US version. Especially considering we play with new people quite often, the stations give new players a chance to make up for a mistake, at a small cost. I also like the large number of tunnels in central Europe, really adds a push-your-luck element to the game. A great one, for sure. The number of plays does not reflect the actual number, we owned this game for two years before I started tracking my plays.

This is a game that both families and avid board gamers will enjoy for it's theme and stratigic gameplay  

Maybe if I didn't have 'Wildlife Adventure' (released in the 80's) which instead of cities, You're trying to reach 8 animals across the world first before the other players do.

Nevertheless. This is a game that both families and avid board gamers will enjoy for it's theme and stratigic gameplay.
And it's better than the original IMO

This game is finding a nice spot in my collection as the definitive intro to boardgaming...or if someone isn't quite getting the rules of another game, we'll pull out Ticket to Ride.

I like the game, but if I'm with people who have played some other games I'll suggest another game, but I wouldn't turn down a game and don't get too upset when a newcomer isn't understanding a game and we end up playing this game.

Fun game and a 2 or 3 player game is nice, but once you get over 3 players the frantic feeling of losing your route really kicks in!

RATING: 4
Yawn fest. Rummy but where the sets you collect are rather dictated to you by objective cards. Consequently it becomes a game of risk assessment, priority assigning, and efficiency. I already work for a living, would rather do more interesting things when playing games. Theme has no connection to mechanics.
I think this game shows the division in what people are into gaming for. Some folks don't want to think very hard when gaming, they want to relax and engage with a simple puzzle, this game will be fun for them. For me, there isn't nearly enough going on.

És ez esetben is csak annyit értem volna el, hogy ugyan maradok utolsó, de legalább 50 pontot talán elérem. Ennyire balszerencsés szériát még nem láttam senkinél. Szóval valszeg egyedi eset...A játék ugyanakkor továbbra is nagyszerű.

See my comment on Ticket to Ride. Prefer the original.

Don't like the stations. Tunnels and ferrys are more costly and worth the same amount of points for the same length, so less interesting in my opinion. Variants are OK, but original is best. With the stations, there are no tension at all since it easier to compete your lines in my opinion.

I'm in the camp that doesn't mind conflicting additions to this expansion. It is both a more complex game (with the stations and use of mandatory wild cards)and more luck based (the tunnel draw) than the original. The reason I don't mind either of these additions is that they are thematically driven. 

Yes, TTR isn't the most thematic game in the world, but these additions give it that little nod towards theme that the original was lacking.

Está bien. Gana en estética y temática. No es para romperse en coco, pero se pone interesante sobre el final de la partida, cuando ya se tejió una linda maraña ferroviaria.

Me gustó mucho jugarlo de a 5. Gana cuando más se ajusta el mapa. Por ende, cuantos más jugadores, mejor. De hecho, de a dos jugadores, salvo que los objetivos se crucen o exista voluntad clara de puteo, casi que ni te cruzás y cada uno va a por sus cosas.

Tengo entendido que la versión de EE.UU. es más sesuda y tiene más pimienta. Pero ir construyendo líneas férreas en el viejo continente es una verdadera pasada!!!

Next to Lost Cities, TtR is my wife's favorite. That is until we played TtR:E. What was a good game is now a great game. The tunnels add a bit of risk, and the stations really do encourage keeping more destinations. The center of Europe fills up really fast and you do need to shuffle the cards more due to the tunnel rule. City locations will take a little bit of play to get used to, especially for the younger ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the original and Marklin versions more. Tunnels and stations are new, sure, but tunnels just add frustration when you get unlucky, and stations make it more friendly.  Plus, the focus on Europe is more about connecting tickets, and later in the game, ticket draws can be too random to swing a game.

I've heard this referred to as the gamer's version of Ticket to Ride, but I don't buy it.  This removes the choices that are fun and interesting in the original game.

It's a good "gateway game" with easy-to-learn mechanics and light strategy. The downside is that after you've played it 10 - 15 times, you easily have many of the routes memorized. The game is still fun; but there's less mystery, and sabotaging players with less experience is too easy. (There is an expansion which may lessen this somewhat.)

RATING: 6
I've played this game quite a number of times despite my number of plays on BBG due to online play included with Days of Wonders web access code.  The Original TtR is the perfect gateway game to get people who have only played Parker Bros./Milton Bradly games, into the vast world of board gaming.  However, I'm glad I started with this version as I find the original to be a little too simplistic and the components in the original needing an upgrade through USA 1910 expansion (ie larger sized cards) which would be an additional purchase. TTR:E has new game mechanisms as well as already including larger sized cards.  The only nitpick I can really say is that it's a lot harder to find the cities on the Europe map compared to USA and the cards don't really help you despite their images trying.

RATING: 8
A nice little game that always takes a bit too much time for my taste if you consider its depth, but that I will gladly play when no one else wants something a bit more on the heavy side. Plus, it's a classic gateway game. Quite different from the USA version, though, there's less blocking because of the stations, so there might be no direct confrontation whatsoever, depending on the tickets everybody start with.

Great game that requires planning ahead to get the needed route.  An advantage is given to those that play most often as they will learn the usual tickets, specifically the long tickets, and can more easily block a route you need.  Best with 4-5 players but still playable with 2, though with 2 it is most often you are not competing for track.

Juego sencillisimo y viciante. Es relativamente rápido (depende de lo pesados que sean los jugadores; pero aún así es rapidito).Muy indicado para novatos y para niños.
La versión "Europe" aporta más gracia al juego por el hecho de tener las estaciones, los ferrys y los túneles; además se puede jugar sin ellos con lo cual se queda igual que la versión "USA". La ampliaciuón "1910 USA" a mi juicio no aporta nada de nada.
Tenemos varias estrategias para intentar ganar: hacer mucho recorridos o hacer pocos y rellenar tramos largos que dan más puntuación; todo dependerá de los trayectos que te toquen en las cartas iniciales; es muy divertido fastidiar a los demás pero con las estaciones es más complicado. Quizá la mejor versión del juego la obtengamos con una sola estación o ninguna por jugador.

This is 4th game (and the first big box game) I bought when I got into hobby boardgaming a little over a year ago. It's a game with Europe...and trains! Yay! :) It is easy to learn, and a fun puzzle to play. The map is huge and after our first 'normal' plays, to mix it up we sometimes play with 10 extra trains, or a 'Ghost Train' variant that I made up where the Ghost Train tries to fulfil destination tickets of his own. It has stood the test of time and we plan on adding other maps to the mix for some variety. We have never used the stations. It seemed kinda pointless and clunky. Maybe something to add variety in the future.

TOO EASY. No strategy game should have a perfect strategy, yet TTR does. 

No one sees this comparison but I think it is the exact same strategy as rummy cube.  You plan ahead and sometimes get screwed but if you plan right you rarely will. Playing against less experienced players will usually turn into a blowout. I dont play this game anymore because I don't enjoy it.

What can you say that hasn't already been said about this amazing, ground-breaking game.
This is definitely the nicest of the maps and rulesets in the TtR line.  Between lots of 2 row lines everywhere and the train stations, it's really hard to block anyone off from completing routes.
The Europe version does have one drawback and that is, unfamiliar cities for new players (for people not from Europe).  I'll be breaking out the US map for newbies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Fairly simple turn based track building game.  Mainly strategy in placing trains to complete your tracks before others get int he way.  Not much player interaction.  People tend to forget who's turn it is.

More variety in tracks and routes than the USA map.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The Europe map feels very different from the US map. Lots more shorter routes with very few longer (no 5-train, 2 6-train, 1 8-train). Tunnels and ferries only slightly change the feel but add more to the theme. Stations are the most significant change, eliminates most of the blocking aspects or adds a few points if you don't use them. I'm thinking I still prefer the US map by a hair.

I really enjoy the innovations added to Europe after the original Ticket to Ride. There are less big tracks to claim here, but the tunnels and ferries have interesting mechanics, and the crowded board weakens the strategy of ignoring tickets and going solely for big routes. Admittedly, stations make it hard to fail a ticket; however, I like the encouragement that provides to draw even more tickets.

The towers/stations are really important in this game. What I slightly dislike about this game, is that there are so few long routes. On the other side, it's the only Ticke To Ride game where you actually can know one of the opponent's tickets, so the tension increases. And the towers make it possible to complete these long routes, as well. It's pretty relaxing to play this game when you know all the cities:)

This version is slightly deeper than the original with a few extra mechanics.  The map is better balanced and creates more focus on completing routes rather than relying on the 6-track train points between cities. The tunnels & stations are my favorite added features with this edition.  Both games are terrific and provide educational value for children too. Grade: A

Thanks to our 2010 Secret Santa for getting us this! This is my favorite of the TtR series: it's the right balance of the original's simplicity and the added rules of later versions. Short routes are the key here, and with that comes a far greater likelihood that you'll be drawing more Destination tickets: 2-3 times per game, it seems like. 

Recorded plays are for the original set of Destination tickets, as well as the 1912 Mega Game.

A decent gateway game with simple rules but enough strategic depth. Extra points for being language-independent. The theme does not appeal much to me, though, and, even if it did, it is somewhat abstract.

I would have to play this game again to see if I enjoy it- it plays out too slowly for my taste (played with family unexperienced in board games including myself at the time other than my sister) and the actual strategy doesn't excite me. Decent mechanics, strong game, just not my style.

Ticket to Ride Europe was one of the first games I bought. It was highly recommended by friends and I was not dissapointed. Most fun with 4-5 people this will keep you entertained for hours.

I think it would be enough with one 'Ticket to ride' game, since this one is so similar to the original one. No point of having the both... But maybe I should get one of them.

RATING: 7
Maybe not a fair rating, perhaps, but 4 new players took about two hours to play this one.  There is not enough here to be a two hour game.  The winner was the player who happened to draw tickets that meshed well with one another.  I wonder if that is usually the case...

Game is definitely better when played at a brisk pace.  It does have a larger luck factor than I usually prefer, but I enjoyed a 3 player outing recently.  I chose to keep this in my collection over Airlines Europe because placing the airplanes on the board of that one was largely irrelevant.

Slightly worse than the original in my book. The stations pretty much destroy any chance of blocking opponents, and I don't care for the new locomotive fields and the tunnels, either. Separating long and short routes is a good idea though. Overall, pretty close to the US edition.

Pay attention to this message! Train NO. 3456 from Prague will be delayed about 35 minutes. We apologize for potential complication to you. .... but not this time! In TTR europe trains always arrive on time. You can trust me.

I love this game! It really shines with a group of four -- competitive, tense, and full of interesting choices -- but it's also enjoyable with only two. The rules might seem a tad bit intimidating at first, but once you start playing, they begin to feel almost intuitive. I've played this game with gamers and non-gamers, and they have all, to the person, enjoyed it and asked to play more. Plus, it doesn't hurt that the components (particularly the board and the cards) are beautiful. Highly recommended.

I've only played this and vanilla Ticket to Ride. I like this one more. But I think I'm doing something wrong because I never draw more tickets, I just scramble to connect and try to finish before everybody else, which seems different than the session reports I read.  Our games are always very close. Good for the family.

The first one was a fun light game. I think in this one he tried too hard to make it appeal to the critics of the original and just made it more annoying and fiddly.  So many short links that end up costing you five cards. More bother for little reward.

My first gateway game I play long time ago but I have to say that I never enjoy the USA map much. I read on BGG forum and see that people recommend Europe map as a replacement. I give it a try on this map and I found that it's fun to play TtR again. The station placement improves conflict situation during gameplay a lot. So playing among family member is smoother than USA map.
Cities name are a bit hard to pronounce/remember their name for us but hopefully we would get used to it soon.

My personal favorite of the ticket to ride games.  Played this recently with 4 players and it was really fun.  Usually I play with just 2 players, and its a little silly because normally one person sticks to one side of the board and the other person takes the other side of the board and there isnt much strategy to it.  A good game though.

I like Trains. =]

A very enjoyable, easy-to-learn game which is good for enticing people who aren't "into" board games. Having played the vanilla version, I can say that the Europe version adds enough new content to make the game much more strategic and adds a bit more challenge.
Very good. =]

I like this one just as much as the base game.  The unfamiliar geography for U.S. gamers means it's tougher to bust this out with the more casual gamers who usually enjoy Ticket to Ride; the extra rules with tunnels and ferries also makes the game more complex.

So TtR Europe is really the gamer's version of the system, but it's still too light in some respects, so that might hurt the game overall.  Still, I like it a lot and really respect the game system and how it brings people into the hobby and is so enjoyable for newer gamers to sit down and play.

I feel this game is equal to the original, in that I believe it is worth owning both as long as you and someone you play with loves TTR.  I enjoy the tunnels and ferries this game added, and it's still easy to teach. 

My rating reflects simply that the original gets more plays because I tend to play with new people, but I think this is a more than worthy "sequel" with cool new additions.

RATING: 6
Ticket To Ride is a simple and quick game that is tactical, with a little "screw you" factor to keep it interesting.  While 2-player games of it have little involvement, 5 players still feels solitaire, although, available routes fill up quicker, so the tension of the game is sharper.  Although this feels light, there is an interesting luck management component using cards that keeps things interesting, and the board and theme is pretty (although gameplay has nothing to do with building and managing train-lines in any real sense.  It's practically an abstract card game). Balancing card gathering and line claiming also adds to the immediacy of each turn.  TtR is good for causal gamers and more advanced gamers who want to pull out something quick, pretty and generally fun. Though I still feel you need more luck at times than skill, which is disappointing. Which Destination cards can really decide your game.

RATING: 8
I enjoy Ticket to Ride, so naturally find nothing wrong with it's successor.  With that said, I do prefer the original.  I don't believe the tunnels, or ferries offer anything of any real substance (it just prolongs obtaining cards making shorter routes more attractive - in a sense removing the decision), and I actually prefer the map of the original, even if I am European by birth right.  The American map, I find, lends itself to more interaction and screwage and therefore more fun.

UPDATE:  After quite a few additional plays of this I have to up my rating, as my opinion of TtR:Europe has  heightened with more familiarity.  I don't mind the tunnels, and think they actually can add to gameplay as they add a risk/reward element, but I am still not convinced about the ferries.  These routes can really slow ones progress, as they require locomotives.  Seems o.k. in theory, but in practice this can cause a headache.  Where once the occasional locomotive gave one the ability to replace a card that couldn't be drawn, the new rules now can constrain that flexibility and cause that dreaded feeling of "draw, draw, draw and hope or the best".  This is because, there is nothing here to substitute for the locomotive cards, so those going for ferry routes I feel are at a strong disadvantage to those without.  WIth that said, the Europe map is beginning to shine and with more plays, and knowledge of the routes the map can be delightfully cut throat.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is classic for a reason.  Easy mechanics and mild strategy combine to make for a quick, entertaining game.  Once you have sorted the longest routes, it becomes pretty obvious which one a particular player is shooting for, but given the incentive to complete multiple routes, defense is a dangerous proposition.  Generally good game, although I'm not sure how long it will last as a top choice in our house.

It's the original Ticket to Ride with a new map, tunnels that make it possible to lose your turn (if you take risks), and train stations that make it harder to block.  If you aren't familiar with the location of cities in Europe, you'll be searching a little although you have an idea of where they are from the destination ticket.

Predicting where someone will go seems more difficult.  That being said, blocking doesn't seem quite as effective with the addition of train stations and the number of "detours" you can take.  My rating may drop because of this.

Playing with more players is more satisfying.  With fewer players there is less competition for routes, so I recommend playing with fewer stations (perhaps 1 and 2 each for 3 and 4 player games) which would increase the tension level and improve the game.  UPDATE: I recently played TTR: the original again after a long hiatus.  I like the original better!   TTR:E adds complexity without really improving the overall experience.  The tunnels add a luck element that I don't particularly care for and the stations take some of the tension out of the route-blocking feature.

Can't compare this to other version of Ticket to Ride as I haven't played those, but I'm extremely pleased with this game.  The game is pretty easy to explain and turns go quickly (little downtime), but you're constantly worried about an opponent claiming the track you want, so there's an internal tug-of-war whether to grab more cards or claim routes.  An excellent quick, tense game.

I like it less the more I play it.  There isn't as much interaction as I thought originally.  I can't see any benefit to trying to block other players' routes.  I want confrontation!  I'm reluctant to play it now; maybe with some rule changes about stations.

Becoming a classic. One of the most interesting maps of the Ticket to Ride games, IMO. Like everyone has said, it's a fun family game that plays a bit solitaire with some route-grabbing to make it fun. It's simple pick up and play style guarantees that it will stay on the shelf.

The quintessential gateway game!
Less simplistic and random than its predecessor TtR, the Europe version is totally brilliant and addictive as hell. Everyone whom I taught the game to has enjoyed it very much and it is still the most requested one at my gaming nights. With the excellent expansion Europa 1912 the game acquires a bigger set of destination tickets (a whopping 101!!!) and, thanks to the Big Cities variant, overcomes its only limit: the lack of tension with 2-3 players. For me this is arguably the best version of TtR and an excellent game no-one should miss in their collection!

UPDATE: more than a year and 50 or something boardgames later, TtR:Europe(+Europa 1912) is still the most played game in my groups. It has showed an incredible staying power that many other boardgames (including some in the TtR family) don't have and everyone who tries it loves it at first sight. Magnificent!

The Europe map changes TtR into a much more challenging game. It's a tighter map, and there are the addition of the stations, ferries, and tunnels, as well as the special long routes.

This is my go to game for introducing friends to the hobby. It's easy to teach and just complex enough to intrigue adults. There's not much direct conflict, everybody ends up completing some sort of agenda, and laying colorful train pieces across a map is simply enjoyable. Thus, even though it's a race to complete agendas, players don't break much of a sweat.

Really enjoy this game.  The mechanic is easy enough for most people to pick up, and the randomness of the card draws and tickets make it always a little different and interesting.  I also like the additions of the ferries and tunnels to spice things up and make the little routes harder.  Love playing it with my wife, though the board is pretty big so there is little interaction in two player games.  I don't know anyone who doesn't enjoy this game.

Love this version.  As I have played TTR North America version so often now, I would not recommend myself teaching it to a new player (as I feel that knowing all of the routes makes it difficult for new players to enjoy).  I would recommend this version to teach all of the aspects that are commonly found in MOST TTR versions (i.e. tunnels, etc).

RATING: 5
My second favourite version of TtR, I like that the stations allow for more ambitious tickets and the map is tight and has some interesting quirks. Nordic Countries is better, though.

I usually find TtR a bit stressful and aggravating, spending turn after turn trying to find just one specific card and never finding it before an opponent steals the route you were going for.

TtR is unique in the way it frustrate me. In a less luck-dependent euro game if an opponents blocks me, I can admit that they outplayed me and it adds tension without being frustrating. In TtR whenever anyone blocks me, regardless if they've clearly been playing better than me and planned it in advance, I still blame luck for not getting me the cards I needed 1 turn earlier. I recognise that luck isn't a huge factor in TtR and that the better player usually wins, but it just doesn't feel that way when playing.

This is a great family game, and a great choie for an intro game for non-gamers.  We've converted about a dozen people who were initially skeptical of "board game night" but now all they want to do is "play the trains game!"  

It's not complex, and not very deep, but it accept some strategy, especially in 3 and 4 player games.  As a 2 player it doesn't work quite so well.  My wife and I, when playing 2P, usually just work on our own tracks independent of one another and count up our points at the end.  The real fun comes with player interaction and conflict, so this is best played in small groups.

UPDATE: My wife and I seldom seek this game out except as a gateway for new people who are skeptical that they'll enjoy a boardgame.  Without fail, they love this game.  It's alright, but we feel like we've outgrown it.  We keep it just to see the joy in other people when we play it with them.

RATING: 8.5
I think the more constricted map causes more competition, which gives TTR:Europe slightly more replay value. Wildcards weren't desirable enough in the original, and the ferry rules fix that. The tunnel rules add both tension and randomness, so I'm ambivalent on them. The change in initial route distribution is a significant improvement I retrofit to the original.

I own these physical versions of Ticket to Ride: Europe, India/Switzerland, and Africa.

I also play TtR on my phone (USA + 1910), and on Steam (USA + 1910 + Europe + Asia). 

My rating for Ticket to Ride as an entire entity is a 9 because it is a game I can be addicted to. The game is simple, but there is also a surprising amount of strategy to this game. I like the set collection mechanism, and the different rules depending on the map selected.

As for rating the individual maps, this is my current preference:
1. United States (w/or w/out 1910)
2. Europe
3. India
4. Asia
5. Africa
6. Switzerland

Very smooth and addictive game with nice theme.

Pros:
+ Fast and smooth game play, almost no downtime at all,
+ Rules are very easy to learn,
+ Nice theme,
+ Nice components - good art work,
+ Although some luck elements exist (card drafting), still game is strategic and fun as well,
+ You can always count all points at the end of game to be sure, if points, which got during the game, are correct.

Cons:
- Game rules are not so excellent made for playing with 2 players, because train cards do not circulate well enough (should be at least 7 face-up train cards for game with two) and the map is not filled enough to use other player's routes with stations,
- Card drafting makes some random in this game. Of course, you can always try to handle that, however random chance should be decreased more than it is in this game (by making more ticket cards and allowing players to take 5 tickets instead of 4 and still keep 2-5 tickets only at the beginning of game and of course allowing to use 7 face-up train cards, instead of 5),
- Card shuffling - the train cards should be shuffled very well and that's the job, one person should do while playing the game - to shuffle cards, because there are so many train cards and they should be mixed well. If you want to shuffle cards properly just when the train cards deck should refilled, then a downtime in game can happen, because cards ar many and shuffling them takes long time.

P.S.
My highest score currently is 170.

I enjoy all the Ticket to Ride games, and while there is much to enjoy in the European version, I think it's the weakest entry of the series.  Let me start with the bad and work toward the good.  The European board is less attractive than the U.S. map, with routes crammed into tight spaces at haphazard angles.  The tunnels are thematically appropriate, but I dislike what they do to the game; there is enough randomness and uncertainty already, and I don't see why we need another random element.  The ferries are also a hindrance to the game, encouraging players to robotically draw blindly off the top of the deck in hope of getting wild locomotives.  There are too few long tickets (only six!?!), forcing the play into stereotyped patterns.  Most significantly, the easy availability of the train stations deflates some of the tension over securing critical routes that made the first game so exciting.  I'm not saying I entirely dislike the stations, but their inclusion comes at a cost.  Initially I was also skeptical about the removal of the 6-train connections and the overall shift toward shorter connections.  The original Ticket to Ride's strength lies in its drama, and breaking it down into more incremental pieces leads to a less dramatic, more balanced game.  Alan Moon has a tendency to create games where you score zillions of times in little tiny amounts.  I think sometimes he goes overboard with this idea, since bigger chunks of scoring provide more pressure and drama, giving me the feeling that my next short-term goal is very important rather than just a minor matter.

The prevalence of shorter routes does shift the emphasis of the game nicely toward completing tickets and building an efficient network of tracks.  The original game was too often won by whichever player drew tickets that could be completed with chains of long, length 5 and 6 routes.  The European version is much more balanced in that regard.  It's still important to have some luck with drawing synergistic tickets, but now there's much more flexibility in route planning, and now all areas of the board are viable.  Another point in favor of the European version is the way that the stations make the 5-handed game less of a crapshoot.  The larger cards are of course a great improvement.  Finally, the finishing scores tend to be much closer in the European version; this is the flipside of the incremental-ism that I criticized earlier.  The choice then, is between a game that is tighter, more balanced, more varied (Europe) and a game that is more dramatic, more tense, more interactive, but is more prone to wild successes or catastrophic failures (USA/Canada).  I enjoy both games, but prefer the original by a large margin.  Ticket to Ride Europe may be a good choice for those who usually expect to play with the full table of five players; others should stick with the original.

So simple yet so engaging... It appeals to both casual and experienced players. It's fast, simple and easy to teach, but the sense of achievement and the fact that you have a clear goal to complete makes for an exciting experience. There aren't many long routes, so the expansion 1912 is highly recommended.

This is the first game, after Risk, Monopoly and cluedo that really introduced us to board gaming. And it's the one the missus likes to play the most - without having to twist her arm - so it tends to get played fairly regularly. It would also be the game I would pick most as a gateway game; because it was ours. There's something about this game. The balance of luck and skill is just right. The map is nice and so are the cards. Even the plastic trains look okay. Would love to just be able to trade cards though! It has to be one of the best family friendly games, even if a little blocking goes on occasionally, its all good fun - usually! It plays with 4 in around 45 minutes.

This is one game I like to call almost perfect. It's easy to understand and teach and it's a lot of fun. I've play it with kids and adults and both like it. Everybody love the train pieces and in our case, the Europe map. I've play it with 3 and 5 players and it works best with 3. The 5 player game seems to take more time and if someone has AP you'll be waiting. But I truly recommend it if you want a family or light game to play with friends.

Better than the original (America) map.  Not only is it bigger, but it adds complexity in the form of tunnels and train stations.  

Note: Thurn & Taxis has similar features (drawing cards, connecting cities, numerous map expansions) but is a more engaging game.  It isn't as popular here in the US because of the antiquated theme (the south German postal system, c. 1700s) and because it is more strategic.

This game has been around for awhile, but I just love coming back to it.  It is the kindest of the Ticket to Ride maps as it features stations, which allow you to use another player's routes; it is also the riskiest, as it features tunnels which you may or may not be able to build, and it features a beautiful map of Europe, which is a lot of fun.  The game is so simple, but it is just so much fun.

less fun than the original.  tunnels add an undesirable luck element (esp. the 8-length tunnel) and the stations remove any strategy from the game.

Sínen vagyunk
Vasút és társasjáték asszociációból kevés embernek nem a Ticket to Ride széria jut az eszébe. Ki az Egyesült Állomokat „sínesíti” be először, ki Európát, mégis a listák előkelőbb helyén az európai verzió áll.
De miért is? Amíg az Újvilágban egyik bevált taktika bizonyos útvonalak befoglalása és ezzel az érzékenyebb lelkű mozdonytulajdonosok „megbántása”, addig az Öreg Kontinens már más füstök fújnak.
Az alapvető játékmenet – vonatkártyát húzol, vasútvonalat építesz, menetvonalakat teljesítesz- nem változott, csak újdonságokkal bővült.
Egyrészt vannak olyan útvonalak, ahol kötelező mozdonyt, dzsókert letenned (4-5 főnél már komoly cél egy-egy mozdonykártya megszerzése). Másrészt az alagút építésekor kockázatot is vállalsz, amire vagy felkészülsz, vagy nem.
Harmadrészt, egyben legfontosabb változás, hogy megjelennek az állomások, amelyek segítségével egy-egy már befoglalt útvonalat tudsz felhasználni a kezedben lévő értékes menetvonalak teljesítéséhez. Összesen 3 állomás áll a rendelkezésedre ehhez. Elegáns módja a problémamegoldásnak.
Negatívumként talán csak a menetjegyek relatíve kevés számát tudom felhozni, de mindezen apróság ellenére egy nagyon jó játékról van szó, amely magyarul is elérhető.

POSTIVES

I like train games. 

It's visually appealing.

The Western side of the board is congested with lots of short routes. The Eastern side is sparser with longer routes. This contrast together with the unusual shape of Europe with its many peninsulars makes the map interesting. 

The tunnels, ferries and stations add an interesting dimension to the game. 

It is a good, light, fairly short family game. 

Although the rules are easy the tactics can be quite engrossing.

NEGATIVE POINT

The game has a lot of replay value. However there are only 6 possible long routes. It is difficult to win without achieving a long route. The lack of variety of long routes makes them a bit repetitive after a few plays although there are alternative ways of achieving the long routes. You could of course play it without the long route cards.

RATING: 7
Simple and fun. (28.3.2016)

I bought this for my family for Christmas and it further solidified its status as a great gateway game. It's easy to understand and with stations there's less feel bad from blocking. This makes this a bit more multiplayer solitaireish which could bother some. (28.12.17)

I rate this and Switzerland higher than the basic game because the tight maps without many 6 routes make for interesting games where you need to take many route cards if you'd like to have a winning chance.

If I'd have run into this five or six years ago I'd have loved it. Now, with all the games I've  played, I still enjoy it but it doesn't stand up above the others. If I wanted to play a similar style game I'd have choice in my collection.

Usually my go-to game for casual gatherings. It seems to me that this version is more balanced than its predecessor, especially with the addition of more route options and a tighter map. I tend to bring this game out when people want something to do while lounging around. It's engaging enough keep everyone invested in their own strategies but can be a laid back alternative to other competitive games. A very reliable playtime (60-90 minutes, in my experience) is a plus as well.

The de facto gateway game! There's enough meat to keep a gamer's attention, and it's also simple enough not to overwhelm someone who plays literally no games.

I'm normally down on expansions or sequels to good games, but this one is a real improvement.  Larger cards are easier to handle.  Tunnels and ferries add some variety to track building. Stations reduce the screwage factor enough to make it palatable to people who don't handle losing well. Might be the perfect gateway game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Classic Ticket To Ride, very similar to the U.S.A version with a few minor tweaks that allow this to be a 9.5 versus a 9. First from a component standpoint props to the larger train cards, my big hands did not work well shuffling half the deck in the U.S. version. From a mechanics standpoint the tunnels and ferries introduce a slight change in strategy which i like, but the real gem here is the train stations which allow you to borrow a route to complete a destination for yourself. Outstanding fun.

An exceedingly fun train-themed game, with enough decisions and strategy to make it really compelling, yet accessible enough to be played by almost anyone.  I think the stations are a nice addition, as they are costly enough to discourage thier placement, but make blocking strategies a bit more risky.

I love the simplicity of this Ticket to Ride.  I played the Xbox Live versions countless times before plumping for a physical copy in the the guise of Ticket to Ride: Europe.

The board for 'Europe' doesn't seem quite as well suited for two players as the original however.  I've only managed to break this out once - the missus hated it.  Hopefully it will get a chance to redeem itself one night when we have more players.

PL: Bardzo przyjemna gra towarzyska. Grałem w nia jedynie raz, ale już wiem, że na pewno zagram ponownie. Bardzo przyjemna nawet dla dwóch graczy, chociaż pewnie prawdziwa zabawa zaczyna się przy większej ich ilości. Zasady w miarę łatwe do zrozumienia. Szkoda tylko, że wagoniki nie są drewniane. Pozwala na psucie szyków innym graczom, poprzez zajmowanie potrzebnych im tras, zmuszając ich do budowania objazdów lub dworców. Niestety takie zagrania mogą powodować również chęć odwetu...

EN: Very nice social game. I played it only once, but I know for sure I'll play again. Great fun even for two players, though probably the real play begins with more of them. Rules as easy to understand. It's a pity that the cars are not made of wood. The game allows you to ruin other players plans, by taking the routes they need, forcing them to build longer detours. Unfortunately, moves like that can also cause revenge ...

A great family game, and it has the ability to be simplified for younger players.  The game gives a visually pleasing map with fun little trains, even though the train theme is a little weak.  

Down side, the game is more about set and hand management than trains.  Also, I find the Europe map and rules a better game, but most of my family game group prefer the familiarity of the USA map.

RATING: 9
Interestingly different from Ticket to Ride: the map itself require a different strategy, with shorter segments. It also add a few more rules (tunnels, ferries and stations) compared to the N-A. Allow more opportunities to player blocking.

Probably more suited for two players than the North America board.

Remove the stations for a really cut-throat version.

RATING: 8.5
A little more complex than original TtR, mmmm yes; a bit more challenging, maybe; do I recommend it? of course I do!

An excelent game, the addition of the stations and tunnels is great. They add a bit more of complexity to the game. Stations give you an opportunity for scoring tickets while tunnels may force you to spend max 3 extra cards.

Even the ticket cards have the position of where they are located in the map, sometimes you may spend a bit more time that you expected searching for the cities but it is part of the fun.

At the end of the game, you have to be careful of not completing your tickets because you may lose more points than the ones that you win.

-------------------------

Un poco más complejo que el TtR original, mmmm sí; un poco más desafiante, tal vez; ¿recomiendo el juego? ¡Definitivamente sí!

Un juego excelente, el hecho que hayan añadido las estaciones y los túneles lo hacen genial. Estas adiciones le añaden un poco más de complejidad. Las estaciones dan oportunidad de marcar los tickets que uno creía perdidos mientras que los túneles pueden forzarte a gastar hasta 3 cartas extra.

Un detalle es que a pesar que en las cartas de los tickets, vienen las ciudades en su ubicación exacta en el mapa, es probable que pierdas más tiempo del esperado buscando una determinada ciudad; sin embargo, es parte de la diversión.

Al final del juego tienes que tener cuidado de no completar los tickets ya que eso te puede llevar a perder más puntos de los que ganaste durante el juego.

More chugging on the love train—what's not to like?  The stations (which allow the sharing of routes) and tunnels (which add a bit of a gambling element) are nice twists that bump the game up a notch beyond the base set.

RATING: 7
This is a game that doesn't really require a lot of thinking and has quite a bit of luck, but still, somehow, remains fun.  I think the fact it is quite short helps a lot.  How the other players play can affect your enjoyment quite a lot. If you are at a table where everyone just takes face down cards turn after turn until they all have a hand of 20 then it is pretty boring. If everyone grabs vital sections as soon as they can then the game can feel a bit more tense and interactive.

My main complaint is the luck of drawing new tickets.  It seems that at least one person will get lucky and draw already, or easily, completed tickets multiple times and score a massive amount.

선로를 연결할 수 있는 것이 아니라, 운적인 요소도
더했기에 기본판 보다는 높은 점수를 주고 싶다.

The classic gateway game that is far better than the other oft-recommended gateways. I'm not always interested in playing it, but I can appreciate its draw. Europe and its expansion fixes a lot of the problems I had with USA, but the familiarity with the US map is more inline with the gateway status, which gives it a slight edge.  

+Excellent gateway game with simple mechanics
+Great components and presentation
+Slightly more strategic than USA

I have both this and the original TtR and can't decide which I like better. This board has MUCH better balanced game play out of the box: the routes are more evenly distributed and the train stations allow for greater chances to complete routes while ferry and tunnel routes add a new challenge twist. But the quirks of the original board are still fun to work with, too. I think this one works better out of the box without the addition of cards, though.

Overall, a great introduction to Euro gaming and "not Monopoly" gaming in general and still fun for all level of gamers I play with.

This is the perfect gateway game. The Europe-Version probably even more so than all the other ones. I think this was written and discussed so much that there is nothing left to say. Personally I have played TtR with so many different people (and different player counts) who were new to the Hobby and every...single...one of them enjoyed it to the max and was drawn into it. Including myself. I´m enjoying this game every single time and therefore it deserves the 10.

Llevo 6 años jugando y aún me apetece una partidita de vez en cuando. Nada más que por eso se merece un notable alto. Juego sencillo, agradable y que mejoraría con un poco más de interacción entre los jugadores. Apto tanto para jugones como para ocasionales. Recomiendo echar un vistazo a algunas reglas caseras propuestas en BGG: le dan su picante. No me he cansado aún de él. Sin duda, imprescindible en cualquier colección.

My gateway game was Ticket to Ride that one of my friends own. I enjoyed it a lot, but it seemed silly to buy it and have two copies in our group so I bought the Europe version. It didn't have the same simplistic charm as the original however and is not much of a gateway game either. Now that I no longer game with my friend who owned the original Ticket to Ride I may be getting it soon which I prefer much more than this.

Quite simply, 'The Gateway Game' Europe is probably the least confrontational version of TTR, but I prefer it over USA because of the longer routes and bigger card size. Plus with the maps available which greatly change how each game is played, this is definitely a keeper. One of the best tabletop games ever made. I've lost count of how many times I've played this

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's okay, I guess, but for some reason it seems to take much longer than USA. Not sure if it is the tunnels, if there are less routes overall that are grey-colored, or if it just that the map looks weird (trains at right angles) and it's hard to remember what cities you're connecting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A more interesting map than the US original with extra rules that throw some twists into the TTR mix, making decisions much more difficult. Long and short tickets help defray the luck element in what you get, but the restriction to 6 long means that where you're headed is guessable by those who know the game well. I'm less keen on the station mechanism, it's a soft 'last chance' to connect two cities, but it encourages the collection of an armful of cards, with less pressure to get tracks down. If I were buying today I'd choose this over the US map & rules, but they're too similar to justify owning both so I'll stick with my first purchase.

On the whole, I think I prefer the US, but not by a lot. Europe is a tougher map, though its ameliorated somewhat by the stations. I have mixed feelings about separating the large from big tickets, especially as it means that a player only has one chance at a big ticket and that at the very beginning of the game.

An excellent portal game and if your european its easier to find your way around the map than the american original edition. You can play the game vanilla - or with the tunnels, ferry and stations. This adds extra dimensions to a wonderfull gateway game.

Trains? Check. Lots of high quality game pieces? Check. A beautiful, sturdy game board? Check. More trains? CHECK! Ticket to Ride: Europe is loads of fun, whether with two players or more. I prefer it over the original version, though both are nearly identical in game play. The Europe version adds train stations to the mix, making the game that much more interesting. Seriously, you can't go wrong with Ticket to Ride. There's an equal balance between strategy and luck, but an experienced player can mitigate the risk of the latter. Punch your geek ticket and give it a ride!

One of the most perfect gateway game. I introduced many friends to modern boardgames with TTR:E. I think it is relaxing to play, but I believe I'm alone on that. xD

I did play ticket to ride on steam, but I think Europe is much nicer: there are tunnels, ferries and stations and it does make the game a little diffent.

Most of the time I play it with my bf, but it's fun with more than us as well.

RATING: 7
Something that seems to sit in the 'gateway game' category, with a theme that leaves some in my group cold. Enjoyable, although feels better played occasionally rather than repeatedly.

Like: The player interaction, both in cards taken and in competing for space on the board. The feeling of control, both in routes coming together/working around other players' routes, and in trying to get things complete when the end of the game is approaching.

Dislike: It feels a bit like the game is actually won or lost based on how complementary the initial route cards given out, and if any extra routes taken are easily added (or even already completed), rather than through deliberate player action - while it's certainly possible to lose from a good starting set of routes, it's incredibly difficult to imagine winning from a bad set.

First played December 17, 2008, Much like the USA game (different map; same rules), it's a quick learn (less than 5min) and quick play (~30min for 3 player). It does have a good balance of luck and strategy going for it, perhaps more luck. You build secret routes connecting two cities. Your opponents see your line forming, however they don't know your cities. You get more points the longer your route is between cities. Special bonus goes to the longest connected rail line. I'd recommend giving this a gameplay and consideration putting it into your rotation of games to play on a regular basis, however it may not be worth the fuss if you already have another map.

It's Ticket to Ride with more crap!  I prefer the USA map only because I know where all the cities are and also because there aren't what I view as needless add-ons like tunnels and station hopping (which seems counter-intuitive to the spirit of the game).  So remember this review is totally my personal opinion.

Update:  I'm slowly starting to appreciate this one more as the six routes are few and far between and therefore don't necessarily dictate the winner (although the crazy 21 point 8 route is fairly retarded).

A very enjoyable game.  My wife isn't as big of a fan, but will play socially.  Some who aren't very well versed in board games find it daunting at first, but quickly catch on.

It's OK as a family game, but played with gamers, the odds of winning depend on the extent to which your initial routes overlap. Knowing that makes it hard to take the game seriously: you deal out the route cards and see whether you're screwed or blessed, then spend an hour of gameplay confirming it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is my favourite TtR flavour to date.  The map is balanced very well - there are just enough alternative routes between cities to mean you aren't always locked out of the game, but without too many to completely remove the table-flipping cutthroat manoeuvres that are typical in this family of games.  I personally like the tunnel mechanic, some people don't but I think it adds a nice level of luck and some interesting decisions as to whether you'll try and hit the tunnels to make your route shorter but at higher risk of effectively missing turns by failing to place trains.

The stations mechanic is another interesting addition, which along with the tunnels make this much more family friendly than the original game.  The stations allow you to use your opponent's routes if you find yourself totally locked out of a city (maybe if you've been a bit slow or been concentrating on another part of the board), the routes used in this way don't contribute to your longest route bonus, but they are great for finishing your tickets.

I think I would always prefer to play this map over the original, and I also think it's much more family friendly as there's almost always a way to finish your tickets.

Introduced to modern board games with a friend's version of 10th Anniversary TTR. Wow, it opened my eyes to what I'd been missing all these past 10 years or so. Anyway this was my version I purchased soon after that experience. Love it, love it, love it. Now I pass on that love to others who've never heard of this great game, and open their eyes to a world of fantastic experiences.

It's a nice and light game for fun family evenings. The game makes a lovely use of the set collection and hand management mechanics. European version is in general more comfrotable for me as EU citizen; feels more familiar than playing with US map. So far we have played 2 player game without the stations feature; this way the game becomes more strategic. My wife does not really enjoy it that much, so we take it our only occasionally. Good as gateway game for non-gamers.

Nice snack for a game. It's the kind of game that we like to play after a few other "heavier" games: the moment that you don't want to start another heavy game but you just don't want to stop playing yet ;-) Enter: TTR.

RATING: 8
I prefer this version over the original, because of the de-emphasis on the longer pieces of track and the station markers, which basically prevent you from getting totally hosed if one of your big tickets is blocked. But I hardly ever play it, because if we're playing TTR, it's almost always with casual gamers, and so we play the original game because of it's simpler rules and more familiar map.

Just a lovely and perfectly elegant game. 

The game is simple enough for anyone to pick up within minutes, but there is enough tactical decisions to be made during the game to keep it interesting over multiple plays. I love the Europe version for the added Depots, Tunnels and Ferry routes, as well as having a map that is more clustered and contested (all of these elements add more strategic flavor to the game without becoming fiddly in the slightest). The map is beautiful, and I love how it uses the native names for each locale (e.g. München, Roma, etc.). Playing brings back fond memories of traveling to all the various places shown in the game, and of course, the titular song gets stuck in my head (which for me is one of my favorite parts about playing it). 

One of the most pleasant experiences that can be had playing a game.

RATING: 7.3
Very nice game, especially for new players as can be learned relatively quickly and is quite simple to begin with.

The Europe version adds more strategy and planning than the original US version, with both Ferry and tunnel routes.

There is still some chance wit drawing new destination tickets which can be a big swing (an already completed route versus an impossible to do one can be the difference between +13 and -8 to -13 points).

For this reason and the fact that its never a fully strategic game does cap my rating.

Overall its enjoyable, easy going and will play again and again.

Game is good at first but gets a little boring after repeat plays. Of course, my gaming group has insisted on playing it every week for the last two months. That might have something to do with it. I've moved its rating down for sure because of that.

The game can be fun but most of the time, you're working on your own routes and collecting cards. There's not much interaction between the players.

Played with 2 and 3 players. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a pleasant game but a little too simple and luck-based for my taste. Much time is spent collecting cards and scoring each city to city route, but it is the ticket scoring at the end of the game that largely determines who wins. This adds an element of longer-term planning, but also increases the influence of chance.

Dice Tower's go-to gateway game involves collecting sets of cards followed by some conflict in competing to mark those sets out on the board. Especially good for kids as your goals are more or less predetermined, so the question becomes when should you do what. This can also be a problem though as the luck of the draw for missions will mean some people are more likely to win with less effort. Neutral theme should appeal to most people. I don't like the card hoarding aspect to this game as turns can become quite same-y while waiting for the right colored cards.

I bought this game to play on our camping trip (tradition to buy a new game each year) and we couldn't get enough of it.  It is super fun and can be played over and over. We have played it about 15 times and still love it. 

I have two daughters - 7 and 9. They both picked up the concept right away, the 7 year old even uses strategy.  We found they needed help the first handful of plays with their destinations and how to choose them wisely.

A few notes about the game itself:
~ The tunnels are stupid.  We don't play that rule - we treat tunnels as normal routes.
~ I wish there were a couple more long routes (only one 8 and two 6...I wish there were a couple 5 and 7 as well...)
~ Our first few plays we didn't use Stations (to ease into it) but realize they are a good element to the game.
~ We like the fact it's fairly easy to complete your destinations (not much "screwage") as it's better for the kids to handle.
~ I think any destination that involves a ferry or a tunnel should incur 1 bonus point per ferry/tunnel (as it's harder to complete)
~ I wish there were more long destinations...guess we gotta get the expansion.
~ The Olde English font and city names are kind of annoying but you get used to it.

Fixes one of the main problems with the original TtR: it is way too easy to get boned by your opponent blocking one of your routes, even if it was unintenional.  In TtR Europe, you can place a station at a city containing an opponent's route and use it as your own.  You have an incentive not to use the stations however, since they cost you four points at the end of the game.  Also it is nice that you and your opponents can only get a maximum of one long ticket, ever.  Superior in every way.

(Based on 5+ online plays) Inferior to the original and not even close to as good as Marklin.  The addition of stations remove what little direct player interaction there was in the original to the detriment of the game.  The division of long routes and short routes is a good step, but is done better in Marklin where you can continue drawing long routes if you desire.  In my opinion the worst "innovation" of all is the tunnels which may randomly require you to play locomotives.  Blecch!  I'm glad I tried this online before buying.  

If you want a family game, get the original.  If you want a solid mid to light weight gamer's game get Marklin instead.  Thankfully, in Marklin the ability to block is not only back, but the direct interaction is increased with the competition for Passenger routes and the brinksmanship of waiting "one more turn" before activiting your Passenger.

Very hard to believe a game like this is sitting at rank 25?????

Quite a light game, yes a couple more things going on than the original but not anywhere near enough for any kind of strategy player. If you thought the first one was too light and you didn't like it this won't change your mind. Then there is the huge luck/random element that detracts from it coupled with spending most of your time just drawing cards and the tunnels are just silly. 

Playing with 2 like a lot of games is very dry and mechanical, playing with more there is at least a little tension. This would be a great intro game but it would never get suggested in my house or my group and Settlers is a far better game IMHO ergo better as an intro as well. Still for what it is it's OKAY but I think in some ways the original is better just because its shorter, why drag out a light game? Maybe a VERY occasional play but there are so many better games out there especially train games that this would never get purchased or suggested, using BGG rating scale this would be a 3 for me.

 I don't seem to enjoy this as much as TtR. I'm not sure why. It could have been the distribution of destination tickets. Didn't seem to provide much tension to get tracks built. With four players we didn't have much competition-which surprised me. Given the map layout I would have thought it was going to be a very tight game. I'll update after a few more plays. 
I was disappointed in the quality of the components of this edition. Not as good as my copy of TtR which was made in Germany.

I was very glad when this was bought for me (and my family), as it is a well produced, well balanced, novel, happy and (quite) easy 'proper' board game.

RATING: 7
Fun and satisfying, with very low downtime. Easy to learn, it has earned its reputation as the perfect gateway game. The Europe version has a few additional rules that make it a bit more interesting for gamers. However, those few rules make the game a tiny bit more complicated. The basic, "USA board" version of the game may be better suited to initiate total non-gamers.

One of the games we play most regularly, good fun, some thought required (and many changes of plan) but not too intense. I like this game with 3, 4 and 5 players. I prefer this version to the others (though they have merit too). I love having the lifeline of stations!

Just as good as the original. Has a few tweaks which keeps the gameplay fresh and of course a totally different map and set of destinations. If anything this may be even more family friendly because the stations prevent total route blocking, even if it is slightly more complex than the original.

This game really works for everyone who has played it with me.  Decisions made each turn can really influence what can be done latter.  The dynamics create a well paced game where the moves of some players can hinder what others are doing even if they are not done in malice.  The color-blind friendly play is also a bonus.

Mejor que su predecesor. Se ha compensado el desequilibrio que existia en el primer juego entre lineas largas y cortas (no merecia la pena hacer lineas cortas) A pesar de que la mecánica sea la misma con unas pocas incorporaciones es una buena adquisición.

I don't think the tunnels really add anything to the game, and the routes are generally shorter, which means that the routes you get are that much more important. The train stations are nice and forgiving, and a must considering the map, but nothing special.

RATING: 7
It felt very boring, the first time I played this as a 2 player game. It reminds me of Carcassonne which I also don't like.

But after that I gave it some more tries with 3 players and had a blast with it. It's funny to make alternate routes when someone already has train on a route you were planning to take. The other 2 people had fun with it too, so after all this game is worth playing more.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2010)

I had fun the first couple of times I played Ticket to Ride: Europe ,  but this quickly became one of the games I try to avoid although I can be convinced to play it (if there is no other game available) :devil:.

As with the original game, I feel the game has obvious choices (always the same strategy), way too random for my liking (either you got the cards and tickets you need or you don`t) and also too light, very boring for me. In general I dislike games from Days of Wonders for those same reasons. This is a bit better than the original Ticket to Ride as you can play with stations that add a (tiny) layer of strategy.

This Europe edition adds more randomness due to the tunnels, it sucks.

On the other hand the game is perfect to play with the family or to introduce new gamers to the hobby. It also have gorgeous components.

Perhaps I will buy this to play with my family but don’t hold your breath. After playing this I have no desire to play any other game of this series (Märklin, Nordic Countries, Switzerland, the card game, etc.).

RATING: 8
Good game. A little more complex than the base game ('though it's still pretty simple) but the additions improve it for me. 

Fewer longer routes mean that card-hogging (while still present) isn't as prevalent as in the base game where card hogging seems to be the best strategy. Ferries don't add much but the tunnels give a push your luck element and the stations offset blocking a little (it's easy to get blocked out in the base game).

Very good game for new gamers but still fun for experienced ones.

It'll be an adjustment getting use to the different city names and what not.  However, another quality game with great components strong art work and good play.

This is a large improvement over TTR.  The new rules to ensure equal distribution of long routes, plus the overall increase in routes helps to really reduce the impact of luck.  

The stations are also a nice addition.  Ferries and tunnels are new, but just different, not necessarily better.

Overall, this is still on the lighter side of Eurogaming, but offers more than its predecessor.

Great game, especially since I can usually get my family to play! Good gateway potential. The cards in TtR:E are a vast improvement over the original Ticket to Ride, and I prefer the additions in this version--tunnels, ferries, stations, and long route cards.

The tunnels, ferries and stations puts some meat on what was originally a light game. My only gripe is that I wish they would have left the cities names in English for easier spotting. I enjoy playing it online more than on the table.

I wasn't a real fan of Ticket to Ride, but I kept hearing how much better this game was... so I actually bought a copy.  I must admit that I was very impressed with this one... it seems to be much more strategic.  I think it's the best of the Ticket to Ride series... Marklin is a little too chaotic.  There are a lot more smaller track sections to build, and the ferries, tunnels and stations add just the right amount of extra planning.  Much more fun than the others, too.

One of my latest new game, wonderfully produced with nice looking board, simple game mechnices but pack with lots of replayability value. Excellent gateway game for serious gamers as well as for family. As good as Carcassonne if not better. The main difference between this and Carcassonne is one has a nice map and the other don't. Carcassonne is a tile laying game, unique in its own way and this game is less random compare to Carcassonne and easier to strategize. I honestly consider it better than Ticket to Ride: US, the first series of this game.

We play Ticket to Ride as some sort of filler. 30 second turn limit or you get 2 face-down cards and the next player takes its turn. We love it this way, and play it nearly every game night. It has short-term goals, long-term plans and it's explained in a minute. A true classic and well-deserved this status.

Hmmm, fun but not as good as I expected.  Admittedly only played this in 2-player and can honestly image it being much better with more people where there is more competition for routes.

This I like so far very much. It is yet to be seen how well it plays with more than two players though. More comments when I have tried it with my children.

I have now played it several times both for real and on the internet. The internet version performs very well indeed.

I still find it very captivating ... I like that there are several different ways to win ... sometimes I go for a lot of tickets, at other times I try building the longest route and use my trains as fast as I can or just build as many long tracks as possible.

My son beat me yesterday (13. september 2005) and he was so happy ... especially since he knows I never let them win ... he beat me fair and square.

Sometimes I loose because I just can't get the right cards, but all in all it is a very good game indeed.

An excellent gateway game, with beautiful production values. Days of Wonder games are superb! A simple range of choices each turn makes for some agonising decisions, although the ability to use stations is this edition makes some of those decisions easier.

Game is light & engaging.  The problem I have with it is that strategy is almost non existant.  True you have to adjust your routes, and lay track when threatened, and there is much swearing when someones route is stolen.  But often I feel like it just comes down to who gets the best routes.  Yes game play matters but I'd like it to matter more.

RATING: 8
Ticket To Ride's move to Europe is notable for three things: cities as they would be spelled in their own country, long routes to aim for as well as smaller ones, and -- MOST importantly -- the tunnel mechanic which requires you have extra cards to pay the toll if the same colours come up. This latter part adds a level of challenge for some routes to make the game slightly harder but still easy fun for the whole family.

BIG PLUS: increased challenge without ruining the game
MINUS: some players don't get the names

A family game with trains. Choo-choo! That doesn't really sound exciting, but the game really is. What this game does surprisingly well is keeping the players in constant suspense.

Game rules are surprisingly easy and turns go quick but the game still manages to squeeze in a little depth. I'd say hop aboard and give this one a go.

RATING: 7
This adds a little more strategy with the addition of tunnels and stations. Tunnels can require you to add additional cards depending on a random card draw. The stations allow you to use another player's track, but you lose some points. Other than that it is like the original. Start with route cards and figure out a path. Then collect the number of colored cards that match a track segment. Grey segments can allow any cards of the same color to be used. Engines are wild cards. Track segments score points with longer track segments scoring more points.  Complete the routes on the cards to score additional points. It is a nice family game.

Ticket to Ride: Europe ended up being the *hit* game for this Christmas.  It was one of those rare games that appealed to the 'card players', 'board gamers', and 'serious' and 'casual' gamers that tend to descend on your home during the holiday period.  Excellent (extended) family game.

A great example of how a game can not be dense, and yet 100% rewarding.  Great story arc, turn angst, and high stakes.  Forces you to play strategically - but also flexibly.  It's just all there.

Ticket To Ride: Europe is one of those games I often overlook amidst the myriad of deeper games.  Yet each time I return I am reminded of what drew me to the game in the first place and why it still stands tall as the champion of gateway games in my collection.  Few games create the same sense of urgency and tension that this game does. It is so simple and usually your goals are straight forward (that is once you have chosen your destination cards) yet there are moments of fierce anxiety as you race to complete a route before your opponents do.  There are few moments in gaming that compare to the excitement and satisfaction I gain from accomplishing a difficult mission or completing many routs in a game.  With all that being said, I wish that the board was better designed.  I think “America” has a better board, but I much prefer the ambiance of “Europe” and some of the added rout types.  There should be more 6-train routs and maybe even another 8-train route.  Still, this is a fantastic game that deserves high recognition in my collection.

A good game, but other than the long starting routes I can't think of anything to recommend TTR:Europe over the original (or Deutschland). Stations are not as good as a map that offers opportunities to build around a block, Tunnels add luck to a game that had plenty of randomness already, using obsolete names for cities just makes it more difficult to find things, the single 8-length route adds yet more luck.

RATING: 7
Extremely fun.  Love being able to draw additional 'missions' at any point.  Love the tension of claiming the key routes you need in the early stages.  I think the tunnel concept in Europe is great as well. The game is easy to teach new players and about the right length.  The only thing I don't like is occasionally you can be desperately trying to finish your route and then someone ends the game by putting down their last few pieces.  The anguish of failing on your main mission and the knowledge that this means you have definitely lost creates a very bitter taste at the end of the game. This happens fairly infrequently though.

Anticipation and disruption of other players' long routes increases as you play more / memorize the routes.

It is hard to go wrong with any Ticket to Ride game. TTR: Europe plays almost like the USA version with just a few small rule changes to spice gameplay up a bit. If you are not familiar with the European cities, it can sometimes be a challenge to locate them, so let players new to the game sit so they can read the names more easily. Great gateway game for those new in the board-gaming world.

More complex than the TTR America game with the addition of ferries, tunnels and stations.  Depending on the game-geekery of the players, the added rules can be a bonus or a detriment.  Can be played without the tunnel or station rules for those who prefer a simpler version.  There are also fewer long routes on this densely-packed board -- mostly on the eastern (Russian) section of the map -- so certain strategy won't carry over well from the American game.  Paris has an amazing 10 routes entering it; is an essential hub.

Over all more of a challenge to score big than TTR America.  I consider the two games equally enjoyable.

My wife and I really enjoy TTR-Europe.  I am a wargamer and she is a Scrabble player, so this is saying a lot.  Call me crazy but this game reminds me a little of Cribbage.  You need to decide whether you are going to focus on the 'ticket' points at the end, 'pegging' points by claiming longer routes or a combination of the two.  As in cribbage, if you can do both, you will win.

A 2 player game is fun and very easily plays in a half hour to forty five minutes.
3 and 4 players can also play quickly once the players are up to speed.  The game takes on a different dimension with more players and so far plays best with 4.

Not sure it's better than ticket to ride, actually feel as though the USA theme works better so would probably slide that one just above this one, but it still is as good a 'first' board game as you can get. So easy to learn and teach and yet deep enough the better players will generally win.

Just bought this gem of a game... After 5 plays in under 24 hours, I´ll have to rate this a 9! (I won 3 of them!) Cool theme and excellent mechanics combine to make this a blast to play! I just hooked my girlfriend up to play online, so I guess my winning streak will soon be over, as she learns every trick of the game and every nook and cranny of the board, leaving me behind in her dust... Lige en advarsel til danskere der overvejer at købe spillet... Der er et par steder i reglerne der halter lidt, så vær forberedt på lige at læse de svenske og norske regler også! Specielt i afsnittene om at trække kort, og om tunneler!

Played a gazilion times this weekend! Gets tenser with more players, 5 is a bit too many for my taste... The sweet spot seems to be 3-4 players... 2 players gives you too much room to move about and mind your own busines...

Geras ir paprastas žaidimas. Įdomesnis, negu originalus Ticket to Ride, dėl to, kad yra stotys. Niekada nemėgau atviro kenkimo oponentams, o šitame žaidime stotys tai labai apsunkina. Tinkamas, kai reikia nesudėtingo, bet ir ne elementaraus žaidimo.

My least favorite of the three Ticket to Ride boxes.  The additions of tunnels and stations didn't feel well integrated.

Personally my favorite version of Ticket to Ride. You can't be horribly cut off due to the ability to put down a station and right someone else's rail line. Everyone is given the opportunity at one long route (that if they throw away they will lose the game) and 3 shorter routes.

Easy to teach. Easy to play. Luck and strategy required.

Sencillito, pero bastante agradable. Adictivo y muy facil de explicar.

RATING: 7
Simple game that is easy to explain to non-boardgames players. For my taste it’s too long for such a light game, but it has the significant advantage that my partner will willingly play it. Definitely better with more players - on the one time I’ve played with 3, it felt like playing a tedious solo game of card collection. 

This is one game that isn’t over till it’s over - not only is there no player elimination, there is no telling who is winning until the final round, and even then it’s not obvious until the scores are in. The tension comes from a tactical level - trying to guess where other players need to place pieces, and trying to place yours first. 

The strategy, such as it is, comes in a careful selection of routes at the start of the game, and a decision about how to make sure that potential chokepoints won’t make your life difficult near the end. Stations tend to make those chokepoints less dramatic, hence allowing some of the steam out of the game.

Well before the end of the game, you will know whether it is still possible for you to complete your routes, simply by looking at the number of carriages that remain in your hand.

Tunnels add a little excitement, but otherwise, this is a game that is made up of a series of little triumphs as you add yet another little link in a chain. If that is what rolls your dice, then hey, who am I to knock a solid, yet rather less than stimulating, game?

This game is different - this is like having a tea and biscuits with friends - relax and take it easy - although i prefer heavy games i am really impressed how simple and enjoyable game it is.I can even survive luck factor which i hate so much in board games. So much packed in such a simple rulebook.

[LUP 16-Oct-2006] Some extra bits and changes to [i]Ticket to Ride[/i], but not enough for me to feel that I should own both of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only played this once so far, but I did not care for either of the two mechanics introduced in it.  Tunnels just seem to add more variance/randomness without really altering the strategic space (except maybe load up on even MORE cards before claiming a route?  meh).  And the stations tone down blocking tactics, one of the best sources of tension in the original game.

approximate number of plays (pre-2017):  1
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on 30+ plays.  The original is still better for converting non-gamers, but for me TtRE is the superior game.  It retains all the fun of TtR with additional strategic elements and a more balanced board.  However, for true TtR gamer bliss, I must go with its successor, Marklin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Dull, repetitive, and no sense of real strategy.  I've played probably 20-30 games of this now, and I've won my fair share, but I can never figure out why I win the games I win or why I lose the games I lose.

*Edit* Finally dropped this to a "1" because there is no way you could ever convince me to play this again willingly.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why such a monotonous luck-fest is so highly rated.  Different strokes I guess....

2014-02-13 - 7.5 - Very good family game. I'm still waiting to play with five players.
2015-05-09 - 7.5->7 - I'm getting a little bit tired of TTR. I prefer it in non-gamer groups.
2015-10-19 - I don't change my rating but my 7 for this game is for non-gamers groups only. With gamers I prefer to play something else.
2016-07-11 - 7->6.5 - I prefer other games I rated with 7.

We seem to have a much more even win/loss ratio with Europe than vanilla TtR. And while my wife loves this, I don't like it as much as regular TtR because I always seems to get screwed with tunnel draws (I have had 3 consecutive 3 extra card draws during one game).  My wife on the other hand rarely gets nabbed with an extra card, let alone 2 extra cards (and no, she doesn't count the cards). But it's still Ticket to Ride, and it's still fun!

RATING: 9
This may be the game I've played more than any other game out there. It's elegant, somewhat easy to learn, turns are brisk (so there's very little downtime) and it plays as a multiplayer solitaire with just a touch of rivalry that makes the game a little more spicy than it would otherwise be. This means players truly feel in control of their own destiny rather than that they are subject to the tides of whoever is on their left and right. This is less true by adding more players - with 2 players virtually never interact with each other, with 3 or 4 this plays best, and with 5 the game is too cluttered. 

Despite the lack of language dependence players can and _will_ have problems with the geography. TTR: Europe chose to use (some) local names instead of their Anglicized variants. For example, on the gameboard and cards Rome is "Roma" and Copenhagn is Køvnhagn. If you're playing with people whose knowledge of European geography isn't excellent there will be some confusion and lost gametime - and even some tactical mistakes - when one mistakes Smyrna for Smolensk or Sochi. But hey, with repeated plays, one can even learn some geography from playing this game! :)  

Please note: unless you have a ton of money there are a lot of variants out there that are totally unnecessary. For example, TTR and TTR: Europe are the same game with a different board ... which means, if you buy both, you're essentially getting duplicate, unnecessary bits with a different board. $50 is a lot of money for what amounts to ultimately just a new board (unless you're an Age of Steam addict or something).

I like Ticket to Ride as an excellent example of a strategically interesting, yet simple to teach game. 

The Europe map is nice as it lends itself to focusing on your own strategy - as opposed to the US map where blocking strategies are often attractive, which I think is more frustrating for new players.

One of the weakest in a set of fantastic games.  BGG'ers seem to laud the extra rules in this game.  For many of them, more complicated seems strictly better, but I find many of the rules detract from the play, with the tunnels adding randomness and especially the stations just seem to sap the tension out of blocking other players, since they can pretty much always make the connection with a station.  Also, the map looks more jumbled compared to the USA map.  It's nice that this game comes with bigger cards, but I still prefer the original USA version of this game for the streamlined play and greater tension.

This is probably the best Ticket to Ride game. And the outcome is more likely to be skill-based than with regular TTR.

The ferries are cool because the increase the value of locomotive cards, which in turn increases the value of taking face-down draws. This makes your drawing decisions a little more interesting.

The tunnels tend to mitigate the advantage of drawing many overlapping tickets, since these overlapping tickets will be likely to pass through the central tunnel-infested regions. However, they also inject a hearty dose of randomness into the game which I don't think is really needed.

The stations are great. The best thing about them is that they allow you to really live on the edge of the knife with your ticket draws, which makes the game more fun.

Having all the tickets be 12 points or under, except for a single long ticket you get at the start of the game, is another change for the better. Regular TTR does suffer from some insanely lucky ticket draws you can make.

>20 plays counting F2F only.  Hundreds counting on-line, PC and xbox.

As others have noted: nice gateway game. Nice game overall, but not my favourite.

UPDATE: Actually, this game has grown upon me. It is sometimes quite tense, with real turn angst. Less so when played two-player, though. Still works very well in that configuration. Should benefit from more tickets, and the long ones especially sort of railroad (no pun intended) your strategy. 

We play two-player games without the long tickets, which works well.

The tickets seem to be well-balanced and the board is quite tight.  The addition of stations and tunnels added another interesting dimension to the game.  Good stuff.

This game has quickly become our favorite game.  It got 3 plays in the first few days after we opened it and my wife is the type who doesn't usually like to play the same game multiple times in a row.

It was a tough decision for me to pick this game or the original, but after playing Europe and seeing how the new features (tunnels, ferries, and stations) play in the game I'm glad we got this one.  It seems like a step forward for the same price as the original.

I personally didn't care for the addition of the stations; I think the "take a risk" routes (if you play that way) are mildly interesting. However I really enjoy Ticket to Ride and it's nice to have new map variations. I do think that the long northern route should be worth more, but that's because I went for it in my first game without realizing exactly how much it was worth.

A Ticket to Ride variant that stays very close to the original and shares many of it's strengths. Along with some other small tweaks, this version introduces stations (3 per player) which a player can use to share a link belonging to another player for the purposes of completing destination tickets. This is nice since it reduces the potential brutality of getting totally blocked out of a huge destination ticket without completely eliminating the tension that comes from trying to avoid being blocked (since it costs 4 points and a turn to play a station and also because the borrowed link does not contribute towards the longest train bonus).

Ticket to Ride Europe is a solid re-implementation of the original. Most of the changes of this one are oriented to reduce luck, so that skill is more important. It makes the game less cutthroat too, as blocking someone's main route isn't nearly as devastating as in TTR.

What I like the most are the destination tickets: having lucky draws is possible, but I still have to see a win solely based on having luck with the first draw. This is mainly due to the fact all players get a single long route destination ticket, as well as two route short destinations. No more a single player will draw a killer combination of objectives right from the start.

Aside from the obvious geographical changes, the map has also been optimized: there fewer long routes, so it's primordial that you use them wisely and try to go through them whenever you can, as they are worth more points and consume less actions than the shorter ones. The centre of Europe is cluttered with short routes, which makes blocking almost impossible, but if you just build there you will find that, even though you have all your objectives accomplished, you won't have gained much points through route building. The tunnels and ferries are not particularly relevant, as while not obtrusive, they neither increase the game's depth.

Last but not least, the train stations. They do make the game friendlier, as they allow you to use another player's route, but players should avoid using them. The three point penalty you get for placing them, not to mention the consumed action, means placing stations has a considerable opportunity cost.

All things considered, TTR:Europe reduces luck factor dramatically, but also reduces direct interaction, for better or for worse, and has a bunch of weird rules which can confuse total newbies. Still, both titles are great gateways.

Wspaniała gra. Obok Osadników z Catanu najlepszy tytuł do wciągania nowych ludzi w hobby planszówkowe.

Bardzo proste zasady, świetnie wydana. Cenie sobie w tej grze szybkość z jaką potrafi wciągnąć nowych graczy w myślenie, kombinowanie i zaangażowanie się w rozgrywkę. Choć jest to tytuł typowo familijny to doświadczony gracz ma jednak sporą przewagę z mniej doświadczonymi i zazwyczaj będzie zwyciężał. Pomimo tego duch rywalizacji jest obecny do końca.

Obecnie rzadko ląduje u nas na stole. Jednak jak przyjdzie zagrać z nowymi osobami gra się nadal przyjemnie.

- might take too long for such a simple game
- I don't like the option to draw 2 cards from the deck because when you play with people who are really prone to gamble then the 5 face-up cards rarely change.

P.S. I almost never win in Ticket to Ride :D

RATING: 6
This version of the game nearly solves the "long route" problem of its predecessor; however, the game desperately needs more long routes from which to choose at the beginning of the game.  I'm quite ambivalent about tunnels mainly because the short routes already have a built-in penalty:  points.  They're fine for longer routes (4+), though.  Stations serve to counter the lack of double routes and relieve pressure when the board gets crowded, although I'm not sure their use in this game is the ideal.  Still the TTR games continue to be enjoyable and I'm always up for playing them.

Not as good as the original TtR is, because it's more messy and more luck driven. Map design isn't that good either and I'm not a fan of the tunnel -rule. Stations are OK, and you'll need them, because map is what it is. I've played original TtR almost 1000 games, but this one only 20 or something. But I'm still ready to play TtR Europe if someone wants to, but there are better (but also worse) ones available in TtR-serie.

Even better than the original: the large route cards are great, the ferries make it a little bit harder, the tunnels bring a little more luck and unpredictability to the table (while does not make it significantly harder to achieve our goals), but as these features make the objects a bit harder to get, the stations make it easier (but for a price). The best gateway out there!

RATING: 7.5
[2007.Jun.11] An excellent introduction into the world of Euro games. With a high quality production by Days of Wonder, this Alan R. Moon train game builds on the success of the Ticket to Ride franchise. The addition of tunnels, ferries, and optional long-routes only enhances the TtR experience. Played on a beautifully rendered map of old Europe, this game is a breeze to learn.  Whether playing with Euro novices for their first game or taking a break from one of your brain burners, Ticket to Ride Europe is staple that should be present in everyone's game collection.

[2016.Feb.2] Not a gamers' game, but it's still a family favorite nonetheless.

One of my favorite boards. I hate the 6-Route necessity of the original. I hate how important it is to have West-East routes, especially if you aren't dealt a good one at the beginning of the game. I hate how many rounds are spent with people just drawing, drawing, drawing...

Europe, on the other hand, has a bunch of short routes, so people are laying down routes more often. I love having one long route only. Someone having two long routes that overlap in the original can be a killer. I don't play with the Stations, but I think they are a great addition when playing with kids. I let them use Stations and the adults are forced to live without. Unfortunately, this one suffers from having too few routes - like the original - so you annoyingly have to buy the too-expensive 1912 "expansion". That brings down my score.

It's a very good game, much like the original with a few twists.  The one item I don't like is the requirement to take one long route and then at least two short routes.

I like this a bit more and differently than original T2R.  I really like the train stations, ferries, and the limited/balanced stack of "Long" Destination Tickets ideas.  I'm not really sure of a few of the tunnels.  Perhaps a modification of only 2 cards flipped for 2-segment tunnels, or that a penalty cannot be more than half the length of tunnel (rounded up), might lessen potentially severe penalies.  But this is really a VERY minor thing and I'm not fully convinced any change is required so I'm perfectly fond of playing this most of the time versus original T2R USA. There is definitely more tactical tension on this map, and stations are a very good backup plan to have or to use with your primary strategy if you know fairly certain that someone will have a link that you could use.  With 5 players, someone's major plans probably will get ruined (and might suffer penalty tickets).  Will it be you...??

Nagyon könnyen megtanulható játék, amit ketten is lehet játszani, de három vagy négy fő esetén jobban kiteljesedhet (öt játékos viszont már szerintem túl sok lehet). A játék helyigénye nagy, mert hatalmas a tábla, és mellette még kell hely a kártyáknak is, meg játékosonként egy nagy halom bábuknak.
A játék attól izgalmas, hogy folyamatosan döntési helyzetek elé állít:
1. Mely városok közé próbáljak utat építeni, azaz mennyit merjek kockáztatni? Ha nem sikerül a játék végéig teljesíteni a vállalt útvonalakat, súlyos mínusz pontok járnak érte.
2. Ha cselekvésként laphúzást választok, mely lapokat húzzam fel? Van, hogy egyértelmű, hogy mit érdemes választani, de van, hogy nem, hanem kicsit hosszabb távon kell előre tervezni, és annak megfelelően választani.
3. Mely részútvonalat próbáljam épp felépíteni? Érdemes figyelni a többi játékost, hogy merre építkezik, és ha számomra fontos útvonalak felé, akkor azokat meg kell próbálni lefoglalni előlük. Vagy úgy építkezni, hogy ha nekem nagyjából hasonlóan jó két útvonal is, akkor a többi játékosnak minél inkább keresztbe tegyek. Persze, éppen ezek miatt arra is érdemes figyelni, hogy ne lehessen könnyen kideríteni, mely városokat is próbálok összekötni, így ne tudják ezt a többiek megnehezíteni.
4. Figyelni kell arra is, hogy nagyjából mennyi van még hátra a játékból, és ennek megfelelően kell próbálni haladni és útvonalakat elvállalni.

A játék amúgy meglehetősen kiegyenlített, alig néhány pont különbséggel végeznek a játékosok, hisz mindenki nagyjából hasonló mértékben tud pontokat szerezni körről körre.
Jó játék, érdemes mindenkinek kipróbálni, a legtöbb embernek tetszeni fog.

Better than the original but there's still only so much you can do with set collection. The one long route mechanism makes it harder to run away with the score like you can in USA by building a super route and drawing tons of route cards, and scores seem usually closer to me. 

I played the TTR series enough that the shine is pretty much gone for me now. The decisions aren't interesting enough for me to ever really "want" to play, but I'll play along if everyone else wants to.

I feel the strengths of this game also form the weaknesses. The beauty is that the game is so simple and easy to learn, the trade off is that it may lack a little depth and excitement. The added tunnel and ferry routes over standard Ticket to Ride do help however.

Edit: played a 4 player game which was a great improvement over the two player game as the board was a lot more congested and blocking was taking place. Still lacking the outright fun to be 8 or higher.

A fresh take on a classic board game, this adds some more challenges with tunnels, ferries and stations. Actually, stations make things a little easier, but tunnels will make you want to pull your hair out if you're willing to gamble! 

We pull this game out when we want to add more challenge to TTR... especially with a 5-player game... You can only imagine how intense it is. 

My only complaint is that the map of Europe is extremely cramped feeling. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer the map of America ... if only it had tunnels and ferries as well.

Played for the first time, two player game, seems to work well and slightly better than the original Ticket to Ride.
Have now had 2 four player games - still works well. I really want a 5 player with some of the evil 'blocker' people who are used to Ticket to Ride.

Hmmm. I wrote the above a while ago. I've since played it heaps of times and I'm really really happy with it. It works really well.

The number 1 go to game in my collection for family nights of game playing. Games take around 3 hours but can be sped up by playing the Big Cities Europe variant in the 1912 expansion. This basically introduces depots and warehouses to move more cards per round into the game. My favourite part of this game is the tension that comes from hoping that the players earlier in the round don't take the cards or the routes that you want. It feels hard to know how to play counter strategies but I think this emerges with more plays. If I hadn't already bought it I'd go for the gorgeous deluxe edition.

Love this game! It doesn't take too long to learn how to play this game, yet there's some strategy to it.  A great family game for sure!  I think Ticket to Ride Europe is better than Ticket to Ride America as there is more clustering around certain areas and more competition for the same routes.  I think the whole layout is more enjoyable and like the added element of the stations which add more strategy and help to alleviate the lack of alternate routes.

RATING: 9
Other than [GAMEID=822], one of the big gateway games praised here is [GAMEID=9209].  We eventually went for [GAMEID=14996], mainly because the map seemed more exotic and attractive than the USA map.  This was a huge hit from the first time we played it, and we played it over and over again even with just the two of us.  We really liked games where we build things, whether it's cities in [GAMEID=822] or train routes here.  The route connection gameplay is incredibly intuitive and we've had lots of luck teaching this game to non-gamers.

When compared to the original, we found the Europe map to be more balanced.  We also found that the stations lessened the sting of getting blocked---you're at a disadvantage, but the penalty isn't as harsh.  We didn't mind the tunnels, and they gave us an added touch of "pressing your luck". The biggest problem with the Europe version is that there are only 6 long tickets that you distribute at the beginning the game.  It quickly becomes easy to memorize them and immediately know where each player is going.  The solution?  We play this [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/144998]variant[/url] where we toss out the long tickets and draw only short tickets.  This makes the game much more exciting, since you never know where the other player is going or where the hotspots on the map will be.  It's also more strategic in choosing tickets since it's more difficult to plan your longest route.  Although most Ticket to Ride games are fun with lots of players, this variant gave much more life to the game, especially with only two players.

After game
Experienced TtR player - 3rd position - "It does play slightly differently ..."
Girlfriend - 1st position - "That was great can we play again"
Me - 2nd position - "At last Ive played TtRE"

Conclusion - fantastic stand-alone game, perfect weight to encourage the un-initiated into the hobby and enough meat for the experienced gamer to get their teeth into.  A game for everyones collection.

I said this about Ticket to Ride: "I just can't get into this game. At all. I want to like it, but choices are limited, luck can make or break a route, and memorizing the routes is a huge advantage but not one that's satisfying or easily equalized, and strategically blocking routes is rough on non-gamers. It's not meaty enough to be a good gamer game, and isn't as good as Settlers of Carcassonne as a gateway game." This version does nothing to change my opinion (while the stations make it easier on new players, they also add more slop to the mix). Meh.

Another lovely Ticket to Ride game. The subways can need a lot of luck to get though, if you're unlucky you can spend more than 4 turns trying to complete just one line. I guess that's my only gripe especially when you hit a bad streak of failing more than 5 turns in a row... .

RATING: 5
[2005] A distraction from the original, not necessary. Force-fit some new mechanics, blech. The new mechanics are not appreciated by us, and makes it feel that it was done to make the (broken?) map work. Drawing cards for the tunnels, the stations, ugh. Did I say 'blech' ?

I'd rate this lower, but it's a TTR, and I'd play this if necessary and asked to play.

...but... After playing Switzerland and enjoying that one, we now appreciate the Tunnel drawing mechanism much more, and will give this another go.

[2012] Have played a bunch since then. It is better, but am annoyed by the poor graphics on the cards which don't match the map so the rating does not change, still a 5.

Very nice game and very easy to learn. In 5-10 min the rules are clear even for a first time board player. Also because of the easy game-play it will be loved by all the members of the family. It does involve some strategy but nothing very complex. I recommend this game to introduce a new board player to board gaming. Also it should be very appreciated by hardcore gamers.

Advantages:
- very easy to learn
- very fun to play for beginners and experienced players
- high quality components
- lots of decisions to make
- high reply-ability
- good player interaction

Disadvantages:
- if a players big track is far from others it will have an advantage but less player interaction
- not very in deep
- not many strategies

Better thant the original. I really like the small added touch : the map is very tight, I love that Europeen cities are spelled in their natural language, the way tickets are split between long and medium is really a nice addition. I like the tunnel even if it adds more luck to the mix. Bigger train cards are welcome too!

For my part I think the station are a good addition. They cost you cards and a turn. So they are quite pricy but they remove some of tension while removing thr blocking strategy. It's a good trade off.

RATING: 8
Same as Ticket to Ride but with a Europe map and the concept of stations, tunnels and ferries.  Stations allow you to connect to cities where you have been cutoff.  It is a friendlier version of Ticket to Ride.  Ferries need a certain minimum number of locomotives.  Tunnels force you to have extra cards in that color on hand because if you flip three cards and they match the color of the route you have to add a card for each one that matches.  

I actually like it a bit better and it is much more kid friendly.

RATING: 5
Maybe it's because I just recently started playing the original Ticket to Ride, but I'm not impressed with the Europe game.  I'd rather play the original.  The ferries and the tunnels just don't strike me as good ideas; more like just a gimmick to justify an expansion, or something 'different' for people who are tired of the original.  I'd rather have a second (or third) map for the original.

Basically it takes a streamlined, elegant system and makes it finicky.  Not a good thing, in my opinion.

A great follow up to the original with the addition of tunnels, ferries, and stations.  Enjoy playing with this one the most because of the challenge factor.

Better than the original game, but not by much.  The tunnels and ferries are an excellent dynamic, and the center of the map gets very competitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Very similar to the original TTR, but the tunnels and ferries are a cool edition.  Much welcome is the fix to the random long haul route problem: everyone gets one opportunity at a long route as game set up.

With two players the switch houses should be left out of the game.  Probably better used in games with more players?  Frankly, I think the game is too "open", and is far more fun with opponents fighting over conflicting routes making TTR something other than a rummy set collection game...for that reason, I am not a fan of the switch house.  It seems tacked on for those who did not like even a little conflict or tension in the game. 

I think I would rate this higher with more players, much like the original.  Thumbs down on the switch houses.  If playing with switch houses, I'd rate this a 5.

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/438673/ticket-to-ride-europe-vs-the-original-ticket-to-ri

That being said, many consider the game to be TOO easy-going without enough meat and therefore, while a negative for seasoned players, it seems to be a very big positive for playing with newcomers, non-gamers, younger folks, and folks who just don't seem to enjoy (at all) the competitive strategic nature of such a game.
See: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/675645/why-i-would-never-recommend-ticket-to-ride-europe

That being said, some seasoned TTR players tend to enjoy Europe more b/c of the tunnels and ferries.

RATING: 8
Fun change up from the original. Family still likes the original best though. If you have TTR and 1910, this is probably not essential.  If TTR is your gateway game, you might be better off trying something else, such as Dominion, for a change of pace.

2/2012 Ticket to Ride all over again.  Tunnels can be tricky if you're unlucky at drawing cards.

RATING: 7
Excellent gateway game - easy rules, fun and thematic components, good mix of skill and luck. TtR:Europe adds some nice twists to basic TtR and has a way to avoid getting a vital route snatched away from you. For this reason I chose the Europe version for my non-aggressive family.

RATING: 7
Fun, light game which plays in a reasonable amount of time for its category. There's definitely a significant luck factor in several parts of the game (drawing objectives, drawing train cards, the tunnels) but I don't find this to detract from the game. Certainly a good entry in the "filler game" category, its simplicity and low amount of screwage factor (at least with 4 players) makes it a very good choice for family/non-gamers nights.
It is also worth noting that the number of players has a significant impact on gameplay; 2-player games are more strategic and tightly knit, while 4-players are more luck-based and somewhat easy-going. For a nice "screw you!" atmosphere, try the 3-player version.

Simple abstract game. There's some strategy but luck has an important role. More players make it more chaotic. Fast paced. Fine quality of bits.
It has a few extra rules to improve it (some are fine, like the new initial tickets, while some simply add randomness, like tunnels).
The map has more (and shorter) routes to  encourage playing more than hoarding.
Overall, slightly better than the original.

Not sure why I rate this lower than the original, there is just something wrong with the map. I like the new way to separate the longer tickets and only deal one of them in the beginning, but it is almost a must to keep it and it's tough luck if it doesn't work well with your other tickets. Stations are a nice addition, especially with more players when the map gets really crowded.

This is an interesting game. We realized that not focusing on money is kind of a rare treat in a boardgame. We like that.
So far our favorite games have been with 4 players, since the train stations come into play and the locomotives are more valuable than in the 2-player games.
The 5-player game was too crowded and too many cards were being held in other people's hands.

RATING: 6
With two people playing constructively (i.e. not going out of their way to stuff their opponent and aiming to fulfil as many tickets as possible) TtR:E is a bit underwhelming. Both games were very close (within 10 out of c100) but lacked the true nastiness of many other route-building games.

I suspect, however, that there may be an alternative strategy in which you take the minimum allowable number of tickets (two), learn the possible routes and then go all out to stuff your opponent. Each unfulfiled route counts double against the owning player so not completing a (say) 20 point long route would almost certainly prove fatal in a game that is otherwise very well balanced.

I'll re-rate after I've played with more and/or nastier opponents.

Not gonna lie, I enjoy Ticket to Ride. It's simple and well made, quick to learn and quick to play. Are you going to speak about that one Ticket to Ride game days after ? No, it's not that kind of game. It's a short and sweet experience, which works well as an introduction to board games or as a quick warm up. It offers limited choices to the players, which including a bit of luck, and a very low level of confrontation.

I like this board the least of all TTR boards. Too many short routes. When you have to go through the center of Europe, and your opponent doesn't, you're screwed. 

And you only get 1 long route throughout the game, so you cannot afford to miss that.

I guess the designers have realized that and therefore added the stations to this game.

Ticket to Ride: Europe was the third game that was added to my collection - my wife got it for me as a birthday present after my brother-in-law got Ticket to Ride USA - naturally Europe seemed a fit since I had lived there abroad for an entire year.

Like Ticket to Ride USA, this is a fun game - although it still gets me how Days of Wonder is so keen to squeeze every possible dollar out of the franchise that it won't release copies of the game with multiple game board maps (the way Power Grid does).  It's easy to teach and learn and decently fast paced (unless you are my brother-in-law Jim, who can make any turn last 30 minutes!!).

Europe is not a mere clone of Ticket USA, also adding Tunnels, Ferries, and Stations.  The Ferries don't add much but the Tunnels greatly impact strategy and the Stations add another element of choice in tactics.  I disagree with other commentators on here that think the Stations were an unnecessary addition.  Unlike Ticket USA, which is a much more spacious map with multiple ways (for the most part) to get to different locales, in Ticket Europe things are much more condensed and claustrophobic.  The Stations are important in balancing out the cramped conditions of the board.  Plus, it's not like they are a free pass - you are still giving up 4 victory points for each Station used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great variant of the original.  I don't know that I would ever want to own ALL 3.  I currently own USA, Marklin, and 1910 expansion, and thus will likely not purchase Europe... but it is a fun game.

RATING: 5
Could be something good... could be something bad.  Adds things that fix some things and break others.  Stations make it less effective to block people.  Not sure if that's good or bad.  The underground lines just make it more random.  Bleh.  And the long/short separation in the tickets is a good thing.

I'm not sure why I like the original version better than T2R:E. It could be that T2R:E is a 'nicer' version of the original as it's a lot harder to NOT make your routes. It could also be that I don't care for the map as much as the american verson. Or maybe it's the new rules that change the game for the worse in my opinion. Whatever it is, we'll play T2R ten times as much as we do T2R:E.

On the positive side, the larger cards a a big improvement over the small decks in the original - easier to hold, easier to see, easier to shuffle! I also like the segregation of the routes into long and short ones, but I don't care for the uniform way they get dealt out at the beginning of the game. I miss having the opportunity to draw a long route late in the game and having to agonize over taking the risk to go for it and keep it or pass it up as it's too risky and late in the game. 

T2R:E is definately more balanced, more friendly and more polished. Unfortunately, it is also less fun.

A great twist on TTR... I debate if it's better... and I think I have landed on: It's a better gamers game that TTR, but its not as easy to get into...so this leaves it just as good as TTR in my mind.

As excellent as the original one (Ticket to Ride USA)....just a little bit more difficult...

Build railway routes through Europe in order to connect up the cities on your several (secret) destination cards. To build railways you must first collect cards of the colours of the routes you want to build. How the destination cards work together, the myriad route connections, the beautiful map, and the interaction with the other players makes this a cool game. But very tense.

RATING: 9
My favourite TtR game. I like the long ticket forcing your hand somewhat. I like that the board is so congested around North-West Europe, but that you can use stations to overcome minor blockages. I love the tunnels rule and the ferry rule. And it's a beautiful map that evokes the period. If I was introducing new players to the game I'd stick to the original version but this adds much more flavour.

The only train game I like. Well, there is Ticket to Ride USA too, but the Europe version is more complex, and more interesting. The tunnel and the train stations feature give a great taste to the game that is lacking in the highly competitive USA map. (04.06.11)

It's a ticket to ride game so it's fun. What i dont like is the small amount of roads - after 5 games you know all the roads and worse -> there are 30 percent of roads that go through rostov-khrakov and that is the trolliest road in the game - this is the first thing the first player placing will place - NO. Very tight but this one road ruins it for me.

Unnecessarily clutters up the original game.  Still a good game and I'm happy to play it, but I think the additional complexity detracts, and would choose the original TTR if offered.

I've only played TTR once (2-player) and TTRE once (5 player) and they only seemed OK.

RATING: 7
My least favorite of the T2R versions that I have played, but still solid. The gameboard looks more cluttered and the lack of familarity with the city names is a drawback.  The tunnels add too much luck IMO and I am not a fan of them.

A really nice game, but the trains always get knocked around. That annoys me, as my players aren't careful and often leave a confused mess on the board.

The additions and refinements in Europe take an already great game and make it damned near perfect. The fact that it's playable in under an hour, with good opportunities for surprise victories, less emphasis on long routes, and plenty of options combine to make this my favorite TTR.

Ticket to Ride: Europe is my first experience with the series.  It is a simple card drafting Eurogame that would be a good starter to bring people out of the classic game market of Monopoly and into the new generation of board games.  It is light enough to play with ages down to seven and has wisps of strategy that would be good for the elder gamer.  Ticket to Ride does not give me that feeling of re-playability as with other games due to its length, non overly engaging theme, and elementariness.

Neat change from American map that adds longer tracks and underwater tunnel routes. Smaller, compacted board makes for more aggressive gameplay. Definitely, recommend if you are a fan of TToR.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can certainly see what all the fuss is about with this game, but it's missing that extra something special for me. It's a lot of work to get everything out (the board is huge), shuffle the huge deck of cards just to play a (maybe) slightly above-average game at best. There's nothing keeping me interested while other players are taking their turns. My turn usually only has one obvious choice to make. It feels like this game needs to be sped up in order to enjoy it more.

An improvement on the original TTR. The station pieces make it less frustrating, as it's harder to cut someone off. And the tunnel routes add a small amount of spice to it. The only negative is you won't know the geography nearly as well at first, and reading the names in their native language will be a little more difficult. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The train stations are a much appreciated addition to the game.  Also, the implementation of ferries and tunnels leads to people actually targeting locomotives;I have rarely seen in that in the original.

The only small gripes I would have for this version is that the colors are not as balanced in this version as they were in the original.  However, Europe does a better job of incorporating the grey lines so it makes up for it.

EDIT: Europe is a much more strategic map than the original Ticket to Ride.  If you are looking to play a more difficult TTR then you may want to check this out.

A fun short game that makes a brilliant filler or evening opener. Sure it's lightweight and fairly random but there's definite skill involved and it's a tense and exciting little game. See my review for more details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/163967

Played 5-10 times. 

I used to not like the stations because they made it too hard to block other players, but I´ve changed my mind on that. After all, each station costs you 4 VP, a turn and 1-3 cards. I like the variety on this map, with the tunnels and ferries, and I like the fact that every player gets  a long ticket at the start of the game. This may be my favourite TtR.

Fun, competitive, beautifully made.  Does for one's European geography what playing Risk did for my international geography.  I should try to find a board game that teaches my African geography, I've got no idea where any of those countries are!

Better than the original Ticket to Ride. Now there's a reason to specifically aim for wild cards, and if you get blocked out, it's not immediately the end of the world. The addition to tunnels makes certain paths riskier, and really makes decisions that much more important. A far more fluid game than traditional Ticket to Ride, and in my opinion, a better one.

Best game of 2005 and one of my all-time favorites.
Updated version of the ultimate modern boardgame. Boardgame perfection really. This is bit more friendly map than USA TTR and thus better suited for family gaming. Sadly the tunnel rules add some complexity so in the end it's hard to say which one is the definite family game. I would still say Europe. Other than tunnels all the good things of the original apply to Europe aswell. Despite the slight increase in complexity, I think tunnels are nice addition too as they increase the exictment of  the game and add lots of tense moments when everyones eyes are on the card flipper. Europa 1912 is recommended if you plan to play a lot (cards of it anyway, the warehouses and depots are questionable). This simply the BEST game. It brings non-gamers and gamers together in unique way.

2-Player Comment:
* I love all Ticket to Ride maps as 2p, it's the game I play most often with my wife. 

Expansions:
+Ticket to Ride: Europa 1912 

I also own Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries, USA and Märklin versions.

This is a classic game that's starting to garner some "elitist sneering" - unwarranted in my opinion. It's a great gateway game, who hasn't played rummy-style games even if they haven't played hobby games? It's accessible, can be played by those new to the hobby and has some depth for gamers who play it sufficiently to learn routes and therefore strategy/tactics. There's also some expansions (notably the [gameid=182078] and [gameid=53383]) and some alternative games (e.g. [gameid=31627] that help manage other player counts)

A good entry level stratgey game that provides enough depth for experienced gamers.
Players collect train cards that are used to claim train routes. Claimed routes cannot be used by other players and points are awarded for claiming routes and linking cities shown on their randomly assigned tickets.

Trains + Set collection + Connect the Dots

This game is the one I recommend to anyone looking to begin exploring the world of modern boardgames (with Carcassonne a close second).

Simple to teach, great presentation, a good level of  depth, a nice range of strategies.  Each game will play differently.

Recommend it over Ticket to Ride America due to stations meaning players are less likely to be able to shut people out of the board, as it is possible to piggy back on other player's routes to help complete one's tickets.

The tunnelling mechanic adds a luck element that creates a bit of fun and suspense.  A great way to learn about European geography.

A step back from the original in my opinion. The stations remove the incentive to block and the tunnels and gray routes with wild cards encourage drawing from the deck rather than from the face up cards. This is a bad thing because one of the best things about TtR is the ruthless efficiency with which you must select your cards. Not so in Europe, just keep grabbing from the deck and you'll get what you need. Yawn.

TTR and all its variants are just good games. “real” gamers like to trash these as not deep enough, or too much luck, but these are people that forgot what fun is. Also, they don’t understand how playing with randomness is actually depth but to each his own. 

Anyway, I like this variant because of the addition of the rule tweaks: mandatory use of engines in some spots, tunnel routes, ability to station. The board plays differently (not so many 6 places) yet because the main mechanics are the same it can be taught quickly. And like the base game the board, components and rulebook are nice. 

The theme fits well of course and I like trains, so there you are.

It fixes many small issues of one of my favourite games (Ticket to Ride), which I rate a 8.5
In particular small cards, mean blocking techinques, excessive luck in the draft of the routes, scarce use of the jokers.....

However I think that the added rules make it more difficult to explain it to newbies. TtR is really straightforward, while TtR Europe isn't if you haven't played its "brother".
At the same time, the additions don't make it a "Gamer's Game", and add more luck with the tunnels, instead.

So, in my opinion TtR is the perfect gateway game, while you should buy TtR Europe only if you like its "brother" very much but after a lot of plays you want something slightly different.

This was a fun game.  I would like to try it again to get a better feel for it.

Got this for Christmas and finally had a chance to play it.  It is a nice easy game.  I pitched my major ticket and tried to gain points with lots of little tickets, but then my husband did the same thing, and then beat me to getting that 8 long track which caused him to soar to the lead.  I can see why this is a good gateway game though.

I like always getting one long route to choose from, and the shorter routes add variety so that players don't always take the same path.  It also helps that the rules are easy to grasp and new players are not intimidated. The fact that the train stations exist (even if they are not used that much) makes the game much more friendly.

A nice revision of TtR with a European map. The cards are all full-sized and therefore easier to hold in adult hands. The ferry and tunnel mechanisms are fun, while the stations allow you to recover from bad luck / sneaky play by your opponents. Personally I'd like to see the stations more expensive to build as they seemed a little too good last time. My only query is why the route between the UK and France that runs roughly from Folkestone to Calais is a ferry rather than a tunnel :-)

The number of players seems to determine where the lines will be built, eg, 3 players, the player who builds in the east will win, 4 players, someone in the west will win. 5 players is best, a real mix-up then.

RATING: 4.5
Simplistic and highly overrated gateway game. Only good for introducing non-gamers to the hobby or for playing with children. If you like train games, especially the computer classics like Railroad Tycoon, you may hate this. The European setting adds nothing over the original American one.

RATING: 5
Personally, I don't really feel like this game adds a lot to the original Ticket to Ride game, and I feel the emphasis on shorter tracks actually takes away from the some of the fun that was in the original.  The requirement of a locomotive on the ferries is a nice change, but nothing special. The tunnels really take away from the planning aspect of the game, and the train stations are certainly not a groundbreaking addition and take away from the "block your opponent" strategies which make the game more fun for advanced players.  All in all, I feel that this game takes away more fun from the original than it adds, but it maintains enough of the original gameplay to remain entertaining. Still, I'd always rather play the original game.

I might like a tighter map better, to discourage card hoarding when playing with less than the full complement of players. But if I have 4 others to play with, we're not going to play ticket to ride so that is moot.

As I said, card hoarding is sufficiently uninteresting and removes any semblance of "network building" from the game, and instead overly rewards card counting and memorisation of the goal cards in the game.

Tunnels and the wildcard requirements for ferries I could do without as they add nothing of value - only a source of game created frustration when it should all stay "player made" so to speak.

Its very inoffensive, pretty too look at, easy to play and leaves room for talk etc. while playing - so ye... Meh... Play something else please?


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played online and would like to own someday - it's a nice game in that it inceases the difficulty somewhat from the original with the addition of tunnels, ferries and stations.  Needs a little more balancing with the long routes out of Stockholm and Kopenhagen, though - the other long routes do not score as highly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very nice sequel.  Cards are better sized!  Still plays well with newbies and experienced.  Feels a tad more dense than TTR:US, but there is still not a ton of player "interactivity."  New tunnels, ferries and stations are a little extra to explain to beginners, but not terribly daunting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Game in a Nutshell: Take the original and add stations to repair breaks in your chain and a few different types of track (tunnels and ferries) that have their own rules for completing those links.

Played as: 4,5 player (Online: 2,3,4,5 player)

Pros: Has all the same fun of the original. The biggest improvement after several plays of this and the original is how they fixed the complete randomness of the route cards, which allows players to stay competitive even with a spot of bad luck rather then being completely blown out of the water. Also the map seems balanced directionally as long routes can go just about any direction (and do, almost guaranteeing crossed paths)rather than being dominated by East-West or North-South.

Cons: The tunnels and ferries are kind of a draw as an addition. It's nice to force players to use wilds on the ferries, but can be bad when your best route requires them. The tunnels, especially through central/southern-Europe, can be intimidating and unforgiving on occasion. The stations can be anti-competitive, or a viable strategy, depending on how you look at it. And finally, the Europe map (compared to the US) itself isn't as intuitive to the US gaming core when used as a gateway.

Other: I really prefer this to the original USA version, and would pick this to play 9 times out of 10. I've raised my rating of this after I can't seem to stop playing the online version at the Days of Wonder website. 
Edit: I think I've finally hit my burnout level with this game after roughly 100 online plays (still I find myself coming back to it on occasion).

Best Use: A lighter 4-5 player gateway-game or played after a brain-burner.

Este juego para mí fue toda una sorpresa. El juego llevaba un tiempo en la calle y yo había tenido la oportunidad de verlo un par de veces cuando jugaban unos amigos. Pero creo que cuando veía los componentes desplegados encima del tablero, no sé, me pasaba como con "A través del desierto", me echaba para atrás. Y eso que los componentes son de primerísima calidad y de un gusto exquisito, pero no sé, eso de ver vagones de colorines por todo el mapa me ponía nervioso. Hasta que un día no tuve más remedio que aceptar la invitación a jugar y descubrí la sencillez del juego y lo tremendamente adicitivo que puede llegar a ser construir una ruta. Además, es perfecto para repasar y ampliar los conocimientos de geografía. Por otra parte, la versión Europa no se distingue de la americana únicamente en el mapa del tablero. La Europea es una versión un pelín más avanzada donde se incluyen los túneles y las estaciones. A mi parecer, son reglas que aportan mayor variedad al juego, aunque muchos jugones lo critican. El lado malo del juego es la escasa interacción entre los jugadores: cada uno construye su vía a destajo. La única interacción es intentar chafarle la vía al prójimo antes de que te la chafe él a ti.

Simple and elegant rules (always a plus for me), many interesting decisions during the game and very high tensions towards the end of the game. This is a fantastic mix of skill and luck and I prefer it to the original Ticket to Ride due to more familiar map and stations which prevent you from being completely blocked by somebody while giving you some additional strategic possibilities.
The rating difference between the top players and the average ones on Daysofwonder website is a very good proof that there is a lots of skill in this game. You've got to be very efficient, decisions in this game are deceptively light but often quite important for your overall score.

This is a great solid game.

RATING: 8.5
Incredibly well designed. Involved gameplay, easy to learn rules. If this were released a couple of decades earlier, it would be sitting right next to Monopoly on every store shelf: a classic released too late to capitalise on the glorious heyday of board gaming.

Only gripe is that the game never feels particularly "competitive" during the game. There is little to no interaction with other players gameplay-wise. A greater reliance on blocking other players out (perhaps by removing some of the routes allowing for two players to build upon) would make for substantially more exciting gameplay. That said, it's still great fun, and a must have. The "tunnel" rule in the Europe edition in particular is an interesting mechanic that allows for shortcuts or big points at the risk of losing turns and not gaining anything at all. Allows for some risky moves to be made on top of the otherwise straightforward gameplay.

Just wish they had the English names for the various European towns- fair enough, it was a choice in design, but the cities/towns are much easier to remember by location when you don't have to memorise their names first.

I ended up buying TTR: Marklin because it didn't have that rule, and for the optional additional Passenger rules.

This is a simple (system) with enough complexity in the options to make it an interesting (and fun) game for those who need a break from the more serious games.  I've played it many times with family and non-wargaming friends and it's always fresh and good fun.

This is a fun game for group of people who are new to gaming. While luck does have an impact, this game support good strategy and a variety öf approaches to winning.  The game does naturally disadvantage those who play the "spoiling game".  Prefer the TTR Europe to USA.  Have the expansion but haven't really needed to played it much yet - original game v good!

Better for gamers than the original, but worse for non-gamers (due to more complex rules).

More balanced than the original, especially with the tickets.

The tunnels, ferries, and train stations are good touches.  Certain cities are nearly impossible to use in a 2-3 person game.  I really do not appreciate the city names being spelled in their native languages--it makes it much harder to find the city.

One of our favorite games of all time. It's no wonder this is considered a modern classic - as it's easy to pick up - challenging enough to develop strategies and find different ways to win. Great for families and 2p scenarios. We play this at least once a week and love it every time we do!

Great game. A lot of fun, with lots of different winning strategies to employ. 

Gripes:
- I hate the train stations. They undermine the ability to intentionally block your opponents' routes, which I can't stand. I mean, I hate it when its done to me, but that's part of the game! 

- Being an American, if I'm sitting on the North side of the board, it can be extremely difficult to find cities on the map, and this is only exacerbated by the fact that most of the cities are spelled with variations that most Americans would be unaccustomed to. Not a big deal, really, it just takes a little longer to find your ticket routes.

I've played this game a dozen times and it's still very enjoyable.
It has just the right amount of rules, a charming theme and  fun gameplay. It can appeal to basically anyone who doesn't hate trains. 
The only downside is that it can get a little bit dull (especially with fewer players) and random (especially with more players) at times.

Had this for about a year before I played it, and... it's Ticket to Ride, in Europe. The additional rules don't change the feel of the game, even if they address some of the issues with the original, such as the luck of the draw, and the strength of the locomotives. Nothing wrong with it. I will play this whenever I feel like playing Ticket to Ride, but in Europe.

...which, isn't going to be very often: Europe turns TtR into more of a "gamer's game", but why? If I want to play a gamer's game, I'll play a gamer's game. It's not a good fit. Lowering my rating. Traded.

I don't actually own it but there is one version often living at my house.

Every non-fanatic gamer should own this. Every fanatic gamer probably owns it already. No brains are exploding by the overload of choices to make. You just draw cards or put trains on the tracks of the right color and pay cards accordingly. But is fun and satisfying to play.

The best thing about this game is how easy it is to teach. Everyone understands it really fast as there aren't a lot of rules.

However, those simple rules hide interesting and tense decisions as you're limited to only one action per turn.

Needs 3 or 4 players to make it really interesting though. With two players there is very little conflict as it's nearly impossible to be blocked by the other player.

This is by far my favorite version of the TTR series.  For more information on how the general game play works see my comments in the original version.  I will mostly be talking about differences here.

There are three differences in rules in the Europe version.  On top of those the cards are larger, I really don't like the small cards in the original version.  I know you can buy expansions now that give you a full set of cards that are larger, but it's not worth the money to me.  The first difference is that there are tunnels that are harder to build.  For example there may be a purple connection that needs two trains, but it's a tunnel.  So you announce you want to try and build a purple tunnel and first three cards are turned up from the top of the train cards.  For each of the cards that are turned up that are purple (since that is the color you're trying to build) you would need an extra card.  So for this 2 train connection if you were unlucky you would need 5 cards to build it on this turn.  You have the option to not build, either because you don't want to or don't have the cards, and you can try again on another turn, but you can't do anything else on your turn so you effectively lose your turn.  The second change is when going over bodies of water you need to build a ferry.  For each of these routes a certain number of locomotives are pictured, this tells how many wild cards you have to have in your set.  The last rule change are train stations.  When you get blocked on a connection, you can now build a train station at one end and use your opponent's connection as your own.

Probably the biggest difference that makes this  game the best for me is the lengths of the destination routes.  There are 6 long routes (worth around 20 points) and everybody gets one of those in their initial 3 routes.  You can still throw it out if you want, but usually you want to keep it.  From here on out there are no more long routes, I think the longest after that is only 13.  I think this just makes things more even and doesn't allow somebody to get those two long routes that are basically the same route so the scores will be more competitive.  If you are looking to buy one version of TTR, this is the one you want.

Fairly light, but a good gateway game for eurogamers and casual gamers.  A true family game.

But also a game that is fairly random and potentially unbalanced (player's route tickets).  Would rather play other euros in the time that it takes to play TTR:E.

Still consider this title to be a decent introductory game.

MUCH better than the original U.S. Ticket to Ride.  The tunnels, the ferries, the stations...all are nice improvements.  But the biggest improvement is the board itself because it promotes competition.  I played a 5-player game and I had to deal with every other player in the game at some point as our paths were crossing and blocking and it was actually a lot of fun.  I had to use 2 of my stations to prevent catastrophic ticket point losses and won the game.  Was very satisfying.  If you have the original American map, burn it...BURN IT!!!  I prefer heavier games, but as a lighter family-type game this is very good.  I was surprised.  Played another 3-player game, won by nearly double the closest score to me, but the real problem was there was very little player interaction.  Not really a fan of the TTR series.

RATING: 10
A játékosok feladata a játék elején húzott célkártyák teljesítése, vagyis a játék végéig folyamatos vasútvonallal kell összekötni Európa térképén a kártyákon szereplő 2-2 várost. Az eredeti, USA-ban játszódó verzióhoz képest ez szerintem nehezebb, mivel annak viszonylag szimmetrikus a térképe, vagyis ha meg is építette előttünk egy másik játékos azt a szakaszt, amire nekünk is szükségünk volt, kis kerülővel mégis el lehetett érni a célállomást, azonban itt sokszor kerülünk olyan helyzetbe, hogy lehetetlenné válik egy-egy város megközelítése. Azonban az egyik újítás - a vasútállomás - orvosolja ezt a problémát. Újdonság még a játékban 2 újfajta szakasz típus: a komp és az alagút.
Ehhez a játékhoz viszonylag könnyű társat találni, mert általában mindenkinek bejön, elég egyszerű, a szabálymagyarázat is gyors, a játékidő sem hosszú. 
A sorozatból szerintem ennek van a legszebb táblája (és rajta van Budapest). Azért így a sokadik parti után már úgy tűnik, mintha a játékok ismétlődnének. 
(Az Europa 1912 kieg orvosolja ezt a problémát a rengeteg új útvonal kártyával.)

After playing it for 10 times I must admit I got bored of it, but playing it again after a few years I saw its merits again.

A classic game improved greatly by the introduction of the stations, which can offer a lifeline near the end of the game. 

The tunnels require an extra element of planning when going for routes as you may have to pay up to 3 cards more.

Slightly more fiddly, due to extra rules, and less possibility of blocking opponents, thanks to the stations, means that the original TtR remains the favourite.

Draft and play sets of cards to build train routes and connect tickets for most points.

Plays: More than 50.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Family game = a game that is easy to teach and play.
# of players: 3-5.
Playing time: 10 mins per player.
Player interaction: Competition for routes.
Randomness: Medium - card draw. A bit lower than the USA version.

Replayability: Very high, often everyone wants to play again immediately.
Fun: The fun lies in the decision making of hand and board management.
Memorability: Low, it's a VP engine that doesn't create stories.

Thematic integration: Weak.
Components: Nice.
Expansions: Europe 1912 is not necessary.

Who will like this: Everyone. No kidding. This is a must-have in every game collection. I have yet to encounter anyone who doesn't enjoy TTR. Even non-gamers often buy their own copy after playing. If you get this or the USA version doesn't matter.

The theme is good, nevertheless a bit abstract, the rules are simple, but there is very few interaction, the duration is 1,5 to 2 hours, which is too much for a simple rules light game.

Egy igazi klasszikus. Belépő szintnek is tökéletes, mert nem túl bonyolult, ám de annál inkább tervezgetős, újratervezgetős, izgulós játék, ráadásul látványos is, ahogy épülnek a vasútvonalak.

Két játékos esetén viszont inkább a Nordic, mert ez a térkép 3, de inkább 4 játékosra lett optimalizálva. Ketten elég pasziánszossá válik, kevés konflikttal.

Lehetne ennél még jobb is, ha a szerencsefaktor nem lenne ilyen magas, de akkor meg ugye nem családi játék lenne belőle. Annak egyébként (szinte) tökéletes.

A great light weight game to play with young and old alike.  Though the mechanics are fairly simple, using a combination of rummy and... well... umm... rummy, its presented in a manner that is easy to grasp and is a welcome break to brainbusters like E&T

Picked up in a mathtrade. Old plays of this not listed - I definitely prefer it to vanilla TTR - more choices, more competition for routes on the map, some interesting dynamics with tunnels, ferries, etc.

Still, I am at a point now, where this is ultimately a total yawn-fest. I mean seriously, there may as well not even be a board and plastic trains - the game would play just as well with the deck of cards and a chart that lists score values for trading in particular sets. That really is all there is to it. No trading, no real interaction, just take cards or play cards. Not really that much fun.

A much better gateway game than Ticket To Ride (US) because of the greater balance in the tickets.  It is much harder to win this game consistently, whereas in original TTR I regularly score over 150  points because I know all the tickets.  In TTR:E the longest tickets are evenly distributed making for a closer game even with new players.

Old collection

One of the lighter games in our collection: easy rules but with more variety with the tunnels and railway stations to keep it fresh enough in comparison to base TTR. It is also the ideal game to introduce non-gamers into the world of adult board games. After a while, you know most long routes by heart though but then it makes it more interesting to block someone to keep him/her from finishing it... as a conclusion: a fast and enjoyable game that hits the table a lot when we don't want to play for hours or when we play with non-gaming friends.

We also bought the Europe 1912 expansion to include new long routes and of course some expansions and standalone versions like TTR Nordic Countries to make it interesting to play with two players only.

First TTR I played.  Quickly figured out it's just a set collection card game.  A cute and overproduced set collection card game.  There are better set collection card games out there.  Plus, trains are like a black hole of fun to me.  Couldn't have picked a worse theme.

I don't totally 'get' how this became a gateway game up there with Catan and Carcassonne. But it's good, and the theme really resonates for some people. I got the 'Europe' version because it seemed like people in the know were recommending that version over the U.S.

I picked this one up on a whim (having played US and loving it) and must say I prefer this to its original counterpart. Not to mention the much higher quality of cards the map was much more of a challenge than the original. It's a board I still go to even after acquiring a few map collections.

Best "wide open spaces" version of TTR.  Good if the group doesn't like the gotcha potential of The US map, since the train stations make nearly every route accessible.  This is definitely the best map for larger groups as well.

A pretty light game but I was surprised at how long it takes to play.  The box said 1 hour but it took 2.5 hours.  My wife really loved this game and she quickly figured out the strategy and won by a landslide.  It seems like a game where you want to put your moves in quickly instead of holding off until you have the perfect play.  I was a bit surprised that the route cards don't count for more points in the game.

This version just adds more rules to the original Ticket to Ride. It is being sold as a gamers game but in my opinion TtR:E has the worst of the two worlds: it isn't a quick and light game anymore and neither a good gamers game.

But this really shines as a gateway game and it's light enough for the entire crowd to have a good time.

RATING: 8
A lot of great improvements to the original Ticket to Ride. Best upgrade in my opinion is the stations which reduce the animosity between players while still keeping a good amount of competition between players. Another good improvement i think is that the track lenght is a lot more evenly spaced out (i.e. you don't have A whole lot of Long tracks in the west and a whole lot of short tracks in the east). The tunnels also make the locomotive more attractive. If you have played Ticket to ride you will like this game. If you haven't play ticket to ride you should just skip ticket to ride and get ticket to ride:Europe

Used to be my favourite in the series until the 1910 expansion was released for USA. A long ticket deck helps make each player's ticket draws more even.

RATING: 8.5
TtR:Europe is a slight improvement over the original TtR in that the variety of routes is increased with the inclusion of ferries, tunnels and stations.  Ferries and tunnels are pretty straight forward... they make the wild cards a bit more valuable than the base game and make the card draws a little more interesting imo. The stations I'm not as big a fan of. They pretty much cancel out blocking actions as you can now just place a station if you get blocked in an area (at a cost of 4 points though which is somewhat of a balancing effect). The fact that most routes in the game are now short routes and that everyone can only have at most 1 long route per game is more balanced as well as you really can't just load up on long routes by luck of the draw of the destination cards. Overall just slight changes in the game play from TtR but the game feels just a bit tighter and more balanced. It remains to be seen which version I prefer in the long run but the Europe version probably just VERY slightly edges out TtR 1910 USA and MÃ¤rklin at the moment. It's very close though as all three games are very similar and just give slight variances in the tactics/strategy of game play.

I finally got to play this "gateway game" and Ticket to Ride certainly deserves its reputation. Simple and approachable with subtle interaction and a good balance between skill and luck. Plan your rail network based on hidden objectives but act before someone else claims a railway. Gamble to accept new objectives but be prepared to be penalized if you fail. A bit similar to the deeper Power Grid (which is recommended as the next game if you like Ticket to Ride).

In a comparison between Ticket to Ride and Ticket to Ride: Europe, the latter wins thanks to the more tactical opportunities offered by the stations and the tunnels.

More trains (TTR)!!!!! A more complex map with a few new rules that adds to the TTR experience. I also like that you can complete routes even when there is no longer a path for your trains by using the stations. This allows you to piggy back onto a single track segment. Big fan of this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Together with the original TTR one of the most played games I own. It's a good game, which can even be played with 7 years old children.
Personally I like it best with 4 or 5 players, although with 5 it can get pretty chaotic. 
TTR Europe causes less stress than the original because of the stations: it's no disaster when one of your goal-city's is blocked. In the original game that can cost you a lot of points...
The reason I rate it an 8 is that I prefer a bit heavier games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and light.  Works well with more than 2 players, but with only 2, the board is too big for adequate conflict, especially with the train stations.  I'd like to look into some of the smaller maps for 2 player games.

The Europe map introduced new mechanics that unnecessarily complicate an extremely simple game. Except the stations, which are even worse, adding visual confusion and watering down player interaction.

Rating this two ranks higher than the original based on multiple plays now.  More of a gamers game but still simple, fun and easy to explain to newcomers....strategy is deeper with stations, tunnels and more tickets to ride.  Great graphics...beautiful expansive map of Europe incl. E. Europe, Russian and Turkish cities...I like this map alot...same high quality materials...I also like the meatier full-sized cards better.

Got to play it with the designer last night so learned some neat tricks to the game and got more of the background info....fascinating design!!

RATING: 5
I don't know what it is about Ticket to Ride that I just don't really like. When I first purchased the game, I played it quite a bit.  It is a very accessible game, but quickly it seemed like all the games I was playing were the same.  With only a few long routes (of which you are guaranteed one), there didn't seem to be much play variety.  There also seemed to be a high correlation between the player who completed the one 6 (or is it 8?) length segment and the player who won.

Ticket to Ride is a good gateway game, it does play quickly, and it is easy to learn.  But I almost always prefer Settlers as a gateway game, and with my friends, I don't want to play Ticket to Ride. It's too short for a full game and too long for a filler, and really too light to be anything but a filler.

Adds more decisional elements and "solves" the overreliance on a long route strategy of the original. It also entices a bit less hoarding than the original TtR. However, this the Europe version has not seen nearly as much play  daylight savings time as the original. Go figure. *with the acquisition of TtR 1910 it does not look like TtRE will be a frequent visitor, rather an odd relic.

Nice little game that takes the mean vicious economic game of union Pacific and replaces it with route control. I miss UP!!! Warm fuzzy, and competative enough to be a decent game.  Light play, medium length.  Can see why it's predecessor  won the SdJ.

Play consists of quick turns that consist of taking new routes by playing sets of cards, completeing tickets (extended combinations of routes that give bonus points, primary scoring method), taking cards (since finishing routes is all about completeing sets of cards)  

Prefer TTR:E due to rules refinements (tunnels, wild cards, stations allowing to skeeze others routes) and bigger, better cards.  No reason to have both unless you are a die hard collector.  Reccomended for all levels and interests of  gamers.

My preference has flip-flopped;  after repeated plays I now believe this to be a better game than the North American version, mostly because there's less overlap in the destination tickets (no more 20 free points for drawing Vancounver-Montreal after finishing Seattle-New York, thank you very much), but also because of the station houses and the larger number of shorter routes.

Pretty much the same as the original, but different.  New map isn't better or worse, but nice for the sake of variety.  The addition of ferries, tunnels, and stations don't add a tremendous amount, nor do they take away anything.  Slightly greater complexity makes it more appropriate for a gamer crowd, but not as appropriate of a gateway game.  Overall it's good for mixing things up.  It is still essentially TtR.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty good for its weight class, but a bit too dependent on luck for my taste, especially in the late game: just drawing more target routes when you already have a big network is a big gamble - but if you don't do it, you lose to someone who does and gets lucky.

I like it a bit more than the original.  I like the ferries and even the tunnels, because they add more significance to the acquisition of locomotives and there's a push-your-luck aspect to it as well. 

Not sure how I feel about the stations though.  I do like blocking other players, even if they themselves might now.  :evil:

RATING: 8.5
Definitely the best of the series.

We have adjusted the point system and found it much more enjoyable and a little more balanced.  The problem is that we found the best strategy was simply to get your two or three tickets, then quickly extend your route with 4's and 6's to get out quickly and get the longest route.  No one would take tickets that went through Switzerland or any areas with lots of small routes, because they weren't worth the turns they took and the points that came with them.  Think about it: it takes two turns and fours cards to play two little "2's," but it takes one turn and four cards to play one "4" route.  If you pick up cards on that second turn, that means you have an advantage of two cards and three points because you could do a longer route than the other person who is doing the two short routes.  If those small routes happened to be tunnels, you may be down further numbers of cards, and you may have spent more turns getting cards just to make sure you had enough.  So . . . we simply make every train placed worth two points and the longest route worth 5 points.  We don't keep track of points until the end, when we go "look, I have three trains left, so I have 84 points ((45-3)x2).  The game is now almost always won by the person able to complete the most routes, though the longest route sometimes decides it,too.  No more counting and recounting points, and the game moves much more quickly, having really lost nothing of what makes us enjoy it.

What kills it for me with this game, compared to the base game, is the map.

Good, fast, simple fun.  The mechanics allow for very fast play.  This is particularly because using tickets gives you a very definite set of goals; as opposed to for example doing actual trading between cities. The elements of conflict are just enough to keep the game interesting, while the addition of stations helps to reduce the frustration level a bit.  Overall, quite a well-balanced game, offering plenty of enjoyment for its weight.

The flip-a-card-and-see-what-happens aspect added to the basic TtR game just makes for an even more luck-based game, which pushes this further out into the realm of "who gives a flying..."
Now, not only do you need to draw the right cards in the first place, and draw the right route cards, but you need to draw the right cards in order to place trains on certain routes or lose your turn! Foolishness.
In the last game I played, one player was shut down four times on one tunnel while another blithely placed on tunnel after tunnel with no problem. Foolishness.
...also, the fact that the risk to place on a large and valuable tunnel is no greater than the risk to place on a stumpy little tunnel seems a bit off - but it is of no matter as I am unlikely to play this version of TtR again unless under extreme duress.

I like the small changes here, and I think they do a lot to even out the game.  Setting aside the long routes is a good hedge against drawing a game killer when going for new destinations.

I adquired this game to play mainly with my wife. For two players, it basically does not work. The map is simply too big and the interaction between the players is basically marginal. It's like playing two solo games.

I have not he opportunity of playing with 4 players, but it seems to be a better number than 2 or 3 players.

Seemed like with three people this board is actually more competitive for routes than Switzerland.  Maybe because the board is just a touch more sparse and because everyone has to take a long route.  Either way, I like this better for two players than Switzerland.  Maybe disallow stations for a bit more tension?

Good added variety, but I wonder if the stations remove too much of the cutthroat stuff?

Very simple card collecting game, with some route planning. altogether not far removed from rummy. This is one of the best gateway games. I like the tension, the colorful trains and board. This has more emphasis on the strategic element of the system than the other versions of this game.

RATING: 8
IMHO the best of the "Tickets", especially with the 1912 expansion. We love the "no-hosed" factor that the stations provide, but never play with the "warehouses". 
The stations use means that you can't easily be accidently (or purposely) denied a town that is critical to your planning/tickets. To me that allows more options as to planning, and also less "luck of the draw" to playing. If you're hosed early it really makes the game pointless for the "hosed", hence probably not much fun from then on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
TTR for wimps. The stations make it too easy and destroy most of the tension of the main game.

The other changes are OK, not great, but no significative improvement:
-> Tunnels add a luck factor that was not necessary, but it's not especially annoying (makes up a bit for the stations luck of tension, but in a bad way; tension is generated by random elements, not by player decisions).
-> Locomotives are OK, a neutral change.

So, in general, changes are for worse, and the stations are a big mistake.

RATING: 10
The addition of the train stations adds just a little bit of extra strategy to an already fantastic game.

RATING: 8
Only played with 3 players and it has left a feeling one or two more players might be more fun. If it is then I'll probably increase rating. After playing one game with 5 it seems to be more fun with more players. I have a feeling you will not be able to win if you don't choose your long ticket as one of your starting tickets. If it is so (must try at some point) it makes less interesting choices during the game.

The distribution of long and short routes is better than in TTR which should make it a better game, but I find that tunnels and ferries upset the simple style of TTR and there is something about the layout of the European map that I don't like as much as the orginal. (7.5)

Left me cold after a few plays. Even with five players, it's not enough to attempt a strategy or blocking game, and you end up too reliant on the turn of the deck and stupid, obsessive card-hoarding. The weak link in Days Of Wonder's range.

A fun game that is easy to learn and accessible. The scoring is smart, so no-one feels like they are out of the game.

One minor detraction for me was that I didn't feel that engaged with the theme or the role I was playing - I just placed railways pretty arbitrarily according to my missions, without ever thinking much about the 'world' the game is set in. I think it may be because the game is fast and and simple, you don't really have time to 'suspend disbelief' and imagine you really are a railway mogul.

Exactly a family game. Easy to teach. Fun to play. You can play it with not-experienced board gamers too. Be sure they will like it. As you know some people does not like board games. They can see how funny playing board games can be by starting playing with Ticket To Ride. You cannot teach detailed games to these people but this one is easy to teach. No in game language texts, good usage of colors, quality game pieces and board. Balanced game and great game idea is included behind. Every game is not won by same person but generally better one wins but not 100%. A bit luck is included and it effects winner about 30%. Of course you also have to use your brain. A totally stupid one cannot win any game. Can playable fast it can end in 40-45 minutes in average after you experience some. Great replability, you can replay up to 5 times in some days. All families should have one. 

Increased score 0.2 points after playing its IPAD version tons of time.

Funny one this.  I also own TTR USA.  After much deliberation I think I enjoy the original.  It is more elegant and streamlined and the blocking is attractive given that it almost never becomes overpowering.  

I know alot of people say that the tunnels and ferries add depth making this more  of a gamers game.  I just don't buy that.  All it adds are more rules.

And the destinations on this just seem to be a whole lot less attractive.  I am pretty tired of wending my weary way NE, or SW across Europe on those long hauls.

My wife on the other hand will now only play this.  So be it.

RATING: 7.5
It's a great and easy game. For me Catan, Ticket to Ride (any ticket to ride would do, but europe is the best) and Carcassonne and the three "musts" for anyone starting to play board games (not that they are the best games, but the best to start). My only critic in this one would be that after some plays it becomes repetitive as you already know what you have to do to win.

Sadly this is the only version of Ticket to Ride I've gotten to play, but from my friends who have played the other versions I've heard this one has more easy to handle cards and easier gameplay than others. To me it seemed more complicated than the rating here said, but it's easy to get the hang of once you get used to it, there's just a lot of little random elements and the final scoring system is a bit odd. Overall a fun time; it's definitely part of my holiday wishlist along with the original Ticket to Ride.

If there's not enough time for a more involved game (e.g. Puerto Rico) or there some more casually oriented gamers at the table (e.g. my parents) then this game is one of the two staple games that comes to the table. While there is a lot of luck in the game, there are always choices to be made, and there are usually some big swings both mid-game and in end-game scoring that makes everyone feel involved the whole way. Add to that the excellent production values and this game is a real winner for me.

In spite of its reputation, this game didn't catch on with my family. Maybe it was because of the unfamiliarity of the locations, or maybe the rules about tunnels and such seemed too fiddly to them, but there was just no connection--so to speak. So, I traded it. Still, If I had someone interested in playing it, I would play it once in a while, but to me  it's closer to being a mental exercise than a game.

This is a good game - just not as good as TTR.  There isn't really anything that this game does better than the original.

The tickets overlap less so it feels there are fewer opportunities to change up your plan on the fly.  It's a little more scripted.

It's pretty obvious which long destination ticket people have.

Stations are a pain unless you really have to use them.  Tunnels and ferries - ditto.  I'm sure that's the idea, but this game is just less fun and usually ends farther apart in scores.

I like to play it - but only when I need a break from other TTRs ;)

This is my favorite version of TTR. I like the elements the tunnels and ferries add to the game.

A good game, but I prefered the American map because of the sink or swim nature of gameplay (i.e. no stations) and felt that the ferries and tunnels were rules that didn't need to be included. The beauty of the American one is in its simplicity and the push your luck factor, both of which were somewhat lost in Europe. I also prefer the look of the US/Canada board. A good feature of Europe is separating the long missions, but you can do that with the other one anyway.

TtR has definitely grown on me. I originally thought it was a raw efficiency game (which is a lot of it is), but I now appreciate that there is more to it. Its never going to be truly deep, and far too much of the game is spent drawing cards - but there are other dimensions to the decisions.

My TtR of choice. Too bad that it has the tunnels, but I play whenever I can with a small variant: if some card of the same color appears (1, 2 or 3), you only have to discard 1 card (never 2 or 3).

Great gateway to monopoly/clue/risk people.

Much like the original TTR but set in Europe and adds a tunnels and train station element to it. I guess it's a little less cut throat with the stations as they can be used to get to your city when you would normally be blocked.

"At least with 4-5 players and some first-timers, this game just takes TOO LONG, at 90-105 minutes. It would be an OK (not great) 45-minute game, but it far outstays any welcome. Beyond that, I don't particularly enjoy the gameplay. I do like the stations in this version, but am not fond of the tunnels."

What I like:
- Reasonably easy to teach
- I like the stations in this Europe edition

What I don't like:
- Takes way too long (90-105 minutes with 4-5p)
- Placing trains on the map doesn't interest me
- Blocking can be a bit nasty
- Confusion between track colors and player colors
- Not a huge fan of the tunnels, but they're not terrible

An adequate game, but vastly overrated. Way too long with 4-5p, at least if there are a few newer players (my 2 games have taken 90 and 105 minutes). Complicated enough (with the tunnels, bridges, and stations) that a couple newbies really struggled to understand it.

Definitely would not be my first choice as a gateway game. (Nor would Settlers of Catan, for what that's worth). After my second play, I'm reducing my rating from 5 to 4.

I really wasn’t sure about this one. I bought it mostly because it is considered a must have, fearing I was in for a boring and “broken rules” experience. 

I still don’t think the game is sth exceptional on terms of gameplay, rules, interaction, etc.

It’s just addictive. I want to play the game over and over again. I am bewitched. I can’t explain why, so I can’t recommend it hands down, but it happened to me and I am really glad about it.

Maybe it has to do with the classy huge game board and the colorful cards and components. Every game is sth of a feast. A great event everyone want's to be a part of. Very little downtime.

I am having fun every time I’m playing it and when the game ends I want to play it again. That’s more than enough for me!

(Wife's Point of View: One of the few board games in my collection that she trully enjoys and can be played with 2players. She hates strategy games but this one is light and interesting enough. I don't care why but thankfully it works)

I have played TTR a lot, but yesterday was actually the first time I played Europe. I have rated this a little lower than the original. Of course the "new" rules makes it interesting because it's new, and there are some elements that make it balanced in another way than the original, but I also see this version as more messy, and difficult to have an overwiew of everything.

I think slightly better than the base set, as it has some extra dimensions to it. Which you can of course optionally leave out. Being European I find the geography lesson more useful for my kids than the US version.

RATING: 7
More tense than the original version and with the shorter routes, it is not so easy to score points anymore. The distribution of 1 long and 3 short routes make it a little more challenging and balanced. Furthermore, with the additional rules or tunnels, locomotives and train station, it spices up what is already a great game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this one better than the original because the shorter connections seem to put more emphasis on fufilling your destination tickets and encourage drawing more of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Nice change of pace from the original. Slightly less cutthroat due to addition of 'stations'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I much prefer the original Ticket to Ride.  Stations remove a lot of the tension in the game.  Tunnels add an unnecessary random factor.  Ferries make already-important locomotives even more important.  That said, it's still Ticket to Ride, and I really like Ticket to Ride.

(5+ plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not quite as charming as the original;  In an effort to differentiate it may have too much congestion & too many very short routes.  However, my main gripe is that I don't like the tunnel mechanism.  With good players, a lost turn is too valuable leaving a 90-min experience to chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I enjoy this one nearly as much as the original TtR.  I gave it a slightly lower rating because it is a little more difficult to teach than the original game, and the design is not as "clean".  I do like the complexity the tunnels and ferries add, as well as the new way long tickets are distributed.  Not so sure about the stations, but I do see the need for them in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My wife and both enjoy this game as well.  We like the original slightly better but only when we use the initial destination selection rules from this version (i.e. the routes with 17 or more points are separated from the rest and only one may be chosen per player per game).

Very enjoyable.  I personally don't see it as a "Gateway Game":  neither my parents nor my wife's parents would have the foggiest idea what was going on.  To me, it sits squarely in the filler role (yes, a long filler) -- we tend to play this more socially, and games like Vinci and Puerto Rico more competitively.

RATING: 7
Tunnels & stations are nice additions. But there are too few long routes, and the introduction of the ferries doesn't bring anything to the game. Thats why I prefer original TTR with the "USA 1910" expansion: many routes in rotation, a better map and 2 end bonuses ("Mega game").

After a long period in which I have had absolutely no time to give to gaming, it's now a period in my life in which I restarted and I want easy and funny games, with few rules and a deep playing.This is the perfect game. It's quick to learn and to explain, immediate to understand, satisfying, strategic and tactic, colourful and interactive.Very good. It's a direct consequence of Union Pacific, made better and easier, taking elements from TransAmerica and Catan (the longest road). About doubts, I have a doubt about the ticket's score, as soon as in the few games that I played appeared that it's far more convenient to build long lines and limit to just have 2 easy tickets. The only line of 8 is worth 21 points, more than a long ticket (although a ticket is actually worth double points, because it's negative if you fail) and of course the one that is able to make this line first is just the luckiest. But probably it won't be anymore when I learn to play better.Tunnels and ferries are something more, but actually not very important for the game, while staions are definitely a must for the strategy. I cannot understand how the original game could live without stations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Second iteration of a proven system. Some known imbalances where fixed, and some new stuff was added. I think it's clearly the best of the series until now: the original is too luck dependant and marklin is too fiddly and annoying. Good gateway game, but everybody knows that by now.

Plays much better than I thought it would after reading about the game. There is enough there to keep it interesting. Still, it is a little too difficult to keep my 6 year olds attention and even my 8 year old was having trouble focusing on all the route tickets he had in his hand. Next time I am going to play only one route ticket at a time to make it easier for them to make decisions.

Another great game.  It adds 3 new rules to Ticket to Ride US (tunnels, ferries, and railroad stations) which make the game very interesting.  There are only 6 long routes, though, so those are too predictable when someone starts building them (needs more long destination options).  Also, there are a few too many short connections between cities, so it's a little more claustrophobic than the wide open original US version, but I like the new rules, particularly the railroad stations because if someone blocks your route you can play a railroad station and use their track segment to complete your route anyway.

It'a basically rummy with a big train track scoring board which makes it far more entertaining. Easy to teach (my measure is if my brother can get it, then anyone can).

Despite the fact that some people feel the train stations nerf the game too much, I actually feel like they are necessary to deal with the many bottlenecks.  If too many people are west or east, it can be a brutal game anyway.

I love how difficult some of the routes are to complete, especially late in the game where some sections get really choked.  And unlike US, there seem to be more "sections" that your tickets might focus on.  Perhaps you will start off with Baltics/south-east, perhaps no one will touch Italy until the last few rounds, perhaps no one will go to Scandinavian areas, I like the variety.

Eh, it's ok. I don't dislike the game at all, but there are so many games I like more. This just feels a little vanilla. I feel like this version occupies a strange middle space in terms of complexity/depth. The new mechanisms make it just complex enough that it is difficult to introduce to people that don't play many games (I think the original is much easier to teach). On the other hand, it still doesn't give me quite enough to chew on. I'm fine with games that have relatively simple rule sets, if (1) they are quick and light or (2) a deep strategy can emerge from a relatively limited decision space.  This doesn't really provide either of those for me.

Makes an excellent rotation with the base game.

* People will whine about the tunnels instead of properly preparing for them.
* A tighter map than the U.S. and it is much easier to get blocked in a 5-player game.

The game feels a bit more structured than any of the others. Having the 'long route' sets the tone for where you're going to generally be going, which adds a layer of simplification for new players. The train stations are a welcome addition, and bring a new layer of detail without adding too much additional complexity. Full sized train cards are an obvious plus. While this may change after getting the 1910 expansion, I prefer TTR: Europe to the original.

MUCH better than the old one.  Everything I disliked has been fixed: 1) uneven route distributions, 2) when your ticket is cut off you can still make the connection - for a smaller penalty, and 3) there is a much bigger advantage to getting the locomotives.  I never find myself suggesting to play it, but I always enjoy it.

It is an easy to learn game. Every new player can get involved in a short time. Need to have a planning at the beginning for complete the long distance destination card if you want to win. The map is great and in high quality. My friends like the plastic small trains.
A suggestion, put the map at the end of your table and arrange all players to sit surround the map in a U-shape because it will be very difficult for a player to look at the map with upside-down view if sit at the top side of it.

My favourite gateway game and my favourite implementation of the Ticket to Ride series (I haven't played Marklin yet). For 2 or 3 players though I'd really suggest picking up the Switzerland map. Either way, I like the bit of randomness that the tunnels bring. Also, Europe isn't as ticket driven as some of the other TtR games and it is harder to screw people over because of the stations. Switzerland is all about the tickets though and certainly rewards blocking if your group chooses to play that way. (Mine usually doesn't. Usually.)

It's simple, but fun and not entirely brain-dead. When I have non-gamers over, this is the game I pull out. The theme is great, it's as strategic or as cutthroat as you want it to be, and it's quick. Besides, the wife loves it. I'm not entirely enthusiastic about it, but I have to admit, it's a well-made game that anyone could enjoy. It scales up nicely from 2-5 players as well and no one feels lost.

I went for the strategy of ignoring tickets and simply focusing on a large and small ticket on the Eastern side of the map. That combined with getting really large route segments and having the largest route award was enough to win the game. After this victory the game seems to me to be poorly designed hence the low rating.

It fixed all the problems I had with the original version with the new train station component.  Ticket cards appear to be much more balanced and the new tunnels are fun little twist.  Plus a European map is much more interesting than U.S. - A shame they didn't include Finland on the map though!!

RATING: 8
This is the modern family game! The fairly straightforward gameplay and rules are very accessible even for beginners. Basically the same game as the original but set in pre-WWI Europe and with a few additions.

The biggest difference is the addition of stations. These  let the owner use another players connection that would otherwise be blocked off. This takes away a lot of of the original games conflict since it makes it a lot harder to block off another player.

The tunnels make some connections harder and less predictable as they may require up to three additional cards.

RATING: 6
A reasonable game with simple rules that is easy to teach (and generally liked) by friends that don't really play game.

For some reason I've never really put my finger on, I don't much like the game.  Not sure if it's to do with the luck involved in the drawing of cards, or something else, but although I think the game's fine, it's always near the bottom of my list of what I'd like to play.

Had to play this to see if the changes added anything better over the original. I love the bigger cards, but the board seems busier than the US map. My other first impression is that the stations don't seem to be that necessary and complicate proceedings a little. But the strange thing for me is the building through tunnels as this involves alot of card monitoring, and if you get your timing wrong, you miss a turn, which feels disastrous. Otherwise its the usual target induced tension and angst filled dilemma of picking up much needed cards or taking a route before someone else does. Nice feelings to have, but evaporate once you go through the evaluating and scoring and by then I don't care anymore. A bit like eating dessert and then having to wash up.

The TtR 1910 and Marklin edition are superior games vs Europe. The new elements in this game add more randomness, chaos, and unpredictability.

A lot of luck and randomness have been introduced: To build some route segments you must use one or two wild cards and the tunnels may require additional wild cards. The importance of wild cards has been dramatically raised, unnecessarily increasing the luck factor.

Many of the route segments on this map are single routes and the map overall is very unforgiving. Although this produces more tension in the game, the tension isoften of the unpleasant kind. You constantly have to worry weather you will be able to complete your routes in this tight map. The stations help of course, but that's partial consolation.

In spite of all this, the game is better than the original TtR, which has a flaw with its too few destination cards.

Beware that in TtR:E it is much more risky than the original game (and Marklin) to draw destination tickets rather late in the game.

RATING: 6
Dragged for me the time that I played it. I put a lot of effort into making sure I could finish my routes, finished them and had nothing else to do. The game went on longer than I expected. Turns out I should have taken more routes. But how was I to know this? Supposedly a gateway game but seemed punishing to newbies who weren't familiar with the optimal number of routes to take. Too much chaos. Only one play, so would play again but not excited about this one.

Edit: Upgraded rating to 7. There is enough strategy in the drawing cards vs claiming routes to keep me interested, and it fills the gateway niche well as apparently some players can get well over 100 points on their first play.

Edit: Back down to 6. I don't like the stations--they tilt the game toward drawing train cards and playing all your trains at the end since you can always throw down a station if someone claims some of your track.

In this case the sequel is better than the original. (Not to say the original was a bad game.) I enjoy the small changes and the tighter board as it makes the game more challenging. If you could only have one of the two games, I would take TtR:E over the original but both have their own flavor.

I usually get suspicious when someone takes an already great game and starts adding new rules. There is always the fear that they will break the game system in some fundamental way. Therefore I was pleasantly surprised to find that the additions in TTR:Europe are only minor alterations, and not a huge make over. Here are some examples:
- All players are dealt a long route (20 points or more) at the start of the game which helps establish a more level playing field
- There are now tunnel and ferry routes that require some extra strategy
- There is a new station piece that helps prevent players from being blocked out of an important destination. I have not seen anyone take advantage of this yet, but the idea is neat.
Overall its a great game that maintains the fun of the original while adding some new twists. Ticket To Ride is one of the best games on the market, and the European variant is even better.

Jan 2015: We have owned this game from 'near the beginning' of our modern-boardgame emersion. Getting to play as a part of my 10x10 reminds me how I got to today. I still enjoy this game though considered a gateway by purists - fun is fun.

May 2015: Its (almost) complete on my 10x10 and I'm lowering rating per BGG defs. I like it but when opportunity to play happens I have lots of stronger competing choices.

My wife introduced Ticket to Ride: Eurpoe to my sister-in-law, Heidi.  After that single two player game Heidi's response was, "We need to get this game!"  There's something absolutely addictive about Ticket to Ride: Europe.

The game is easy.  Players draft sets of cards in order to connect cities on the board for which they get points.  Players also have ticket cards that require them to connect two cities on the board for points and penalties if they fail to do so.  And of course, each connection shown on the board can only be used once, in a first come first serve fashion, which adds an element of blocking and can sabotage other players' tickets.

At it's heart T2R:E is a race game.  The opening game takes the form of a Mexican stand off.  Players collect the cards they need to complete their tickets while suspiciously noting each other's draws.  But once connections start getting played it will invariably threaten some one else's desired route.  So there is constant competition and constant tension as players race to complete the best routes and their tickets before the game ends.  This tension only increases for the half hour to 45 minutes it takes to play a game.

I've only played the origianl Ticket to Ride a couple of times.  It felt much less intense since there seemed to be more connections and fewer harsh bottle necks.  In T2R:E there exist Train Stations that enable palyers to use their opponents' connections to complete tickets.  Without these, tickets would be suicide and break that whole aspect of the game.  As it is players are much less likely to take tickets in T2R:E than normal T2R.

T2R as a game system suffers from a serious flaw.  It's hard to expand.  Days of Wonder can't just print up a new map and a sheet of rules as seen in Power Grid and Age of Steam expansions.  Each new map needs a set of corresponding Ticket cards.  And if you are already printing a board and cards and a box to conatin them all, you're most of the way to a new game.  I suspect this is why T2R variants tend to be self contained games.  Which is too bad, for me anyway, since that's the main reason I haven't bought any other versions of Ticket to Ride.

Ticket to ride was okay for me. The second time playing I found myself a lot less engaged than during the first play. I will probably play this from time to time but it is not a game I'm actively looking forward to as there is little variety for the time it takes.

My wife and I love this version much more than original T2R.  Fixes all the problems mentioned above as well as adding some more depth to the game.  Also comes with some bonuses: Larger cards, extra trains (incase you lose some) all for the same price.

Will probably get rid of other T2R and just keep this version because it is the only one we want to play.

Fantastic game for wide varieties of gamers and non-gamers alike. 
While I think TtR USA is better for most Americans due to familiarity with the map and locations, the addition of train stations in TtR:E does reduce the level of blocking conflicts that are inherent in USA.
Both are excellent gateway games and still fun for the non-hardcore gamer.

Not as good as the original. This is my least favorite in the series. 

It tends to get a bit cluttered in places. I also don't like the tunneling mechanic, it doesn't seem to add enough to the game for what its worth. I'm also not fond of the ferries, but I like the mechanic better than the tunnels. It also seems like there aren't enough train cards for the game.

Played the original and bought this one due to the high rank here on BGG. Liked this version more. A bit more to the rules and adds a bit of complexity. Definitely worth the price I paid and should be a good game for years to come with non-gaming friends (introducing them to the world of gaming).

After one three-player game: Nice game, good system, right level of randomness, but a little disappointing in the player interaction department (unless I happened to get in an unusual game) because it sorta felt like three simultaneous games of solitaire  on the same board.  I'll bet it feels different with more players, but I'm rating on the one game I played for now.

i don't care for this version. i'm perplexed how the additional elements in this version of ticket to ride, the tunnels and stations, make this more of a "gamer's game," as everyone has been saying. does a game automatically become more interesting through the addition of a few more rules? i think this game proves otherwise. as it stands the tunnels feel too arbitrary and the stations subtract from the tension of building routes vs taking cards. the last point can't be overstated.  without the tension between building routes or taking cards, what really is there to the system?  i can't ever see myself ever wanting to play this version over the original or marklin.

RATING: 10
Disclaimer: rated as a gateway game!

Okay, so "Ticket to Ride" is not really MY kind of game. Too easy, a bit too random and so on. So why the 10? Because it's the ultimate gateway. Honestly, we tried this with many, many people, newcomers to the hobby mostly, and they ALL loved it. Wanted to play again. And again, and again. Friends, family, cats and dogs... They just can't get enough of it!

But more to the point - "Europe" seems to be the best of the crop. Has a bit more strategic options (ferries, tunnels, train stations), the map's great - but play it with 4 or 5! - there are also some great lil' expansions with new tickets... If you look for an accessible, fun and smart game for newbies - or even for experienced gamers who sometimes like to relax over the game board - get it. It's a no brainer.

The gateway game we all love! (Except me) Ticket to Ride: Europe is the only Ticket to Ride title I own, and with good reason. I cannot, in good conscience, rate this game lower than a six due to it's influence on the hobby and ubiquity but I do not like it. At all. It doesn't help that I'm terrible at it, but that isn't the only reason (I'm not that petty). It just isn't [i]fun[/i], or especially interesting. Mostly though, it just doesn't click with my personality. As you can guess from the somewhat generous amount of plays it has racked up, it is rather popular with my group. For locomotive game fixes, this will [i]never[/i] be chosen by me over Railways of the World. Yes, I know they're entirely different but we're going on theme here.

RATING: 8
I just bought this for a friend and recently played my first game.  I can certainly see why people recommend this as a good gateway game.  The rules are straight-forward, but there are plenty of decisions to make and lots of room for strategy.  From guessing the other players' intentions and blocking them, to secretly completing your own missions, to the eternal question of whether to complete a route or take more train cards, there is never an idle moment.  Player moves quickly, players are always involved, and you are always progressing towards your goal.

We didn't play with the Europe additions, so I can't really comment on them.  It seems like it might add one more dimension to the strategy, but I don't see it being a game changer.  We were just as happy to not use it our first time.

The only problem we had with it was figuring out what tickets to keep.  It was hard to find the relevant places on the map.  Considering we are Canadian and none of us are particularly knowledgeable about European geography, it may have been more difficult for us than it would be for Europeans.  The cards themselves did try to alleviate this by showing roughly where they are on the whole map, but it still needs something more.  Hopefully after a few plays we will begin to memorize the locations of the cities.

It's a simple game that moves quickly, keeping players involved, and leaves lots of room for strategy.  So far, it's an excellent game that I will happily play again.

It makes sense this is considered one of the top tier gateway games and has proved very popular with my casual games group.  Also highly prefer this to the original Ticket to Ride.

I enjoy this game more than Ticket to Ride.  I am very eager to play again, but I'm unsure of depth.  This may go down a bit after the shine is off.

The Stations mean that one mistake (or one vandal) does not absolutely destroy you.  If your group likes to cut each other off and screw the other guy, you may wish to limit the number of stations, increase their cost or make the victory point penalty for using them higher.  I'll play a few more times before making a decision but I think I will reduce the number of stations in the 2 and 3 player games.  We added 8 more trains each when playing 2 player.  That worked fairly well.

We have played where ferries and tunnels are treated as regular routes.  No great difference to the game. The larger number of grey routes is a nice feature.  It makes it more likely that people will clash over them. 

I love the larger cards and I'm charmed that the city names are in their own language.

The game has enough luck that occasionally people just playing for fun will win.  This will drive some hard core gamers mad, but it makes it easier to expand the hobby to new people. 

EDIT: I've played this game dozens of time now and have used it as a gateway game to introduce new people to board games many times.  I've not bothered with any of the changes I was thinking about above - we have been enjoying the game as written.  Still a '9'.

Played many more times.  Still using basic rules with no tweaks.  Dropped rating to an 8.5.

An excellent gateway game, albeit a little light playing on the Europe map due to easier routes and inclusion of stations.

I have introduced my fiancée, my mother and her boyfriend to board-gaming via TTR Europe. My fiancée spoke highly of the game to her family, and we introduced her bother and her brother's wife to the game. This is my gateway game of choice when introducing the hobby to non-gamers.

Downgraded to a 6.5 after a couple of plays. A little light for me - although the above comments stand re: excellent gateway - and the Europe map w/stations lacks tension. I will buy the Africa map after a few more plays on the Europe map, to add some much needed interaction and meanness to the game.

Foi muito entusiasmante a primeira noite a jogar Ticket to Ride, eramos 5 o que significa que o jogo foi muito repartido e que houve luta até às contas finais. Este e um jogo contagiante que nos deixa a pensar mesmo dias depois e que reinventa o proprio universo dos jogos, uma vez que o processo de compra e o tipo de objectivos que se conjugam entre todos os adversarios não tem igual. Se, por exemplo, o Carcassonne a 2 ou 3 fica excelente e com mais perde o vigor, TTR e um jogo para uma mesa cheia. Uma obra prima, indispensavel!

First time playing on this map, third time for the TTR series overall.  I liked the addition of stations, but feel indifferent to the tunnel rules.  Fairly simple rules with some good decision making.  (11 MAY 2008)  Second play.  Card set collection to connect stations with the goal of completing routes.  Ok overall, won't strongly resist playing it.  [2009-AUG-02]

I enjoyed this game better that the original as it adds a few things that enhance the strategy.  First I like the addition of tunnels and ferries to just spice up the route building but most of all the stations are what opens this game up for me.  It makes it possible to run your route over other rails so blocking is as much of a annoyance. This was just a more enjoyable experience that keeps the simplicity of the the original but improves upon it.

The folks I've played this with all like it, and I think it's well done.  But it seems that I don't like it as much as I want to - can't say why.  Maybe I'm missing some strategy that makes it about more than set collecting?

Traded.

Personally, I prefer this version to the original.  When it came to buying ticket to ride though we went for the USA edition.  The reason being, is that for me, ticket to ride is primarily a game to be played with non-gamers or as a filler.
For that reason alone, we have the USA version.

A lot of fun, but it's a little 'friendlier' than the American ticket to ride, making the game a little less strategic.

Definitely the best of the series. The train stations add another level of tactics and each person having a long route reduces the amount of luck with the first route draw.

Played this until 4 am during Christmas time. It is a wonderful game. It takes the original game and adds a few twists to it - train depots help you from being blocked out, Tunnels to add an educated gambling, and ferries to make some routes tougher to build. 

One thing to note - the map is of Europe, but circa 1912. So many cities are not familiar. Also the city names are not familiar English names. For example, Athens, Greece is called Athena. This is not an impediment to the game for me, but it certainly different from the USA version. 

Considering the above, the minimum age is a few years higher than the USA version. I don't think my 9 year old could handle the Europe version yet. Perhaps when he is 12.

Not bad.  The elegant simplicity of the original is lost a little, but on the plus side, the risk management questions are more interesting.  In the original, the tickets are the only source of risk taking.  Here, you can consider how gutsy you want to be in laying down tunnel track and placing stations.  Finally, emphasis on short routes and on short tracks is a definite plus, leading to more interesting tactical problems.  Given the choice between playing the original and playing this, I would probably choose this.  Still, because the original is more accessible, that's the one more likely to be pulled out when I have non-gamers at the table.  And when I have gamers, Marklin is a tastier choice.  So this game stands in the unfortunate role of 'palate cleanser'--something to play every now and then just because it's a little different from the others.

RATING: 7
My personal average rating across TtR, TtR:Europe, TtR:Nordic Countries, and TtR: Germany.

I feel that TtR:Europe is elevated further by its expansion, with the warehouses providing a means of immediate surplus cards and the opportunity to leech off of your opponent's tracks.

See my comments on the original game for my thoughts.

I like this game a lot, and it gets a lot of play time with my particular group of friends, thanks to its simplicity and agreeable theme.  I think I would rate this a bit higher if it had a bit more interaction between players.  Yes, you can claim routes to block and annoy your opponents, but in my experience this doesn't seem to happen as frequently as it does on the USA board - this is alleviated even more by the existence of stations to share other players' routes.  Some might enjoy this reduced level of player adversity, but I like a bit more competition - take this from a player who currently owns ZERO cooperative board games!

Great set collecting and route building game. As with Ticket to Ride, I like that each leg of a route scores points and that there isn't a central hub that you have to grow your route out of. The additions of stations make for a more forgiving game, and the separation of long and short routes goes a long ways towards balancing out some of the issues with Ticket to Ride. I also like the addition of ferries and tunnels. In just about every way this is a superior game to the original.

22-02-2015. Rated after like 5 plays or such. I am famous in my local gaming group for disliking Ticket to Ride, but I'll quickly cover it regardless.

In ticket to ride, you either get cards from the central offer, or closed cards from the top of the deck. You then try to build routes that you'll score VPs for. You build a track by discarding as many train cards of a certain color as the length of the track. You score more points for longer routes you finish, but most points are won (and lost) for connecting the routes you got on route cards. These consists of multiple tracks. 

The game is ok, I see that the mechanisms are solid. To me, it's just too light, too abstract/dry to keep me interested.

Great game - I like Europe better than USA for 5 players although both are much better with 4 players.  The stations add an interesting aspect where you can try to predict which long route your opponents might do for you and you can ride them, although that may not be a winning strategy. The tunnels add a nice "press your luck" aspect.  After more plays with the other expansions, Europe is slowly going down in my rating - just don't enjoy it as much for some reason.

Tickret to ride is a very popular game wbere players collect colored train cards in order to claim routes on the board. Every completed route card scores you victory points. This european version is much friendlier than the regular game and it is harder to have your routes cut off by other players.  This game is fun, but there are no really deep decisions to be made.

Pros:quick playing time,beautiful artwork and components. 

Cons:no deep thinking of strategy.

Slightly different than TTR with the USA map. I own both USA & Europe and don't know that they're different enough to warrant owning both, in hindsight. 

I don't enjoy this game with 2-3 players and would rate it a "4". With 4-5 players, the game is much, much more fun, and I would rate it near a "7". Likely it won't be my first choice, but if someone else suggests it I'll play and will have a good time.

My main problem with this game is the lack of theme, which may be more important to me than many others. If theme doesn't matter to you, you're likely to enjoy this game.

The two redeeming qualities it has are: (1) It's a good gateway game. (2) Far more enjoyable with more than 2-3 players.

Jóval több mint félszáz játékos gyűjteményem után pótoltam a hiányosságot, és sikerült játszani vele.

Az ára kissé borsos ugyan (mármint úgy értem, hogy ha nem ismernék egyetlen játékot sem, nem hiszem, hogy bizalommal szurkolnák le egy dobozért 10eFt-ot).
Szokás a TuT-hoz hasonlítani, de azért ez valahogy teljesen más. Én itt nagyobbnak érzem a szerencsefaktort (útvonalak), de a grafikai hasonlóan rendben van mindemellett. Ezen felül a vonatok pakolgatása, a térkép telítődése valami hihetetlen extrával dobja meg az élményt.

Ticket to Ride is really more of an abstract game rather than a true railway game - if you can accept this, the series is excellent. TTR Europe is easily the most interesting and replayable of this series. Stations are also very useful added back to other expansions, especially India and Germany. We don't usually play with Depots as they don't add any interest to the game and just slow it down.

    I personally like this game better than the original for two reasons -- the map is a bit more fun and the introduction of stations prevents a player from spending their entire time blocking you.  In my opinion the original is little fun with two players.  This game is -- blocking just doesn't pay.  With three or more the original gets more intense than this one -- decide which you prefer before buying.

    Bigger cards than the original and they're beautiful, along with the board.  A pretty game -- and a definite first choice for introducing newbies into the game world.

    As with the original, the online play is excellent (comes included with the board game) as the machine manages all the bookwork.  But the board is worth having too.

An excellent gateway/family game, with plenty of luck and just enough strategy to keep more advanced gamers from getting bored. This is very simple to play, and quick to set up. Even the player who is furthest behind in points can keep interested in the game by focusing on completing goals.

It's taken a couple of years for me to realize it, but Ticket to Ride Europe may be the best Ticket to Ride game. It retains the simple gameplay of the original, but it adds just enough extra stuff to keep the game from being simplistic. It might just be that I'm overly familiar with the original, but TTR:E is my go-to family game these days.

While it's essentially the same game as its predecessor, it has a significantly different feel. On two occasions a player has had an exceptionally good draw of cards covering the eastern portion of Europe and going on to an easy victory by more than 40 points. More play is definitely required, but we all still love to play it.

Nice set collecting game. A bit on the lucky side, but still with an element of skill. I like: ferries, tunnels, route distribution; don't like: stations, drawing cards endlessly.

The fabled DoW production quality turns out to be pretty unremarkable, about on par with Abacus or Kosmos, but with plastic trains instead of the wooden pieces a German company would have given us. Bring on an all wood edition!

Good with 2 or 5, though I prefer Andromeda for 3-4 players. I'm going to hold off on buying this, because I think a better version with less card drawing is still to come. It needs one more iteration to get there, basically.

Probably more of a 6 than a 7 for me, but it gets another point because I thought about it after playing it and want to play again and try some different things next time. Always a good sign.

Update: played some more TtR and was less impressed... dropped it to 5.

A few points about the accessibility of this game:
- No reliance on in game text.
- Visual mechanics.

These make the game very easy to teach/learn, and can be played with all the family no matter what their native tongue is (especially useful in mixed language families) - you only need one person to be able to read the rules and you are good to go.

Visual mechanics of seeing the board, the trains on it, the score board, the cards to draw (other than the blind deck) - make it intuitive to remember what you are supposed to do - good when learning, or for non-gamers/children etc.

The physical nature of the trains also appeal to me as a gamer and I find there is enough to think about/conflict in the game to keep me interested as a light euro game to play with a nice half pint of homebrew.

Marked as previously owned as I bought this for my sister (so it's technically true that I briefly owned it).

I view it as a lowest common denominator: anybody can be taught how to play: your children, your declared game opposing friends, your grandparents. Can be fun, especially if you use expansions tailored for specific group size and to spice things up. Superior to the base (US) version, as the stations offer a way out of beeing blocked out of a route, giving you more control at the expense of being a bit friendlier and less cutthroat at the same time. Not much interest for gamers here, though, Stone Age, Settlers of Catan are both heavier and more complex.

The missus and my first game at the Liverpool Lions boardgaming club and a very enjoyable welcome to the hobby. Mrs F plays this obsessively online, I like it, but generally prefer to play something else. Prefer the variety of strategies to the original, but it definitely misses out on some of the elegant simplicity. Also, the stations make the game a lot harsher on beginners, and favour knowing the ticket deck.
Edit (Oct 2010): My opinion has mellowed, and I find I generally enjoy TTR:E, 2 players or more. My previous thought that stations are "harsh" on beginners may have been influenced by the game I played being a very cut-throat 6-player bash. Now I have played Big Cities from 1912 I really want to get the expansion

I find that when I'm not playing the game, I'm thinking up new strategies to try next time. I like how there are different approaches one can take: focus on the long route destination, build many small route destinations, build just the high scoring routes, or try to block others. It allows players to focus on their own goals but also provides opportunities for player interaction.

I love the production quality and the big board. It's a quality product. I don't play it all the time because it requires more than an hour to play but it is very satisfying even when I don't win, especially with the final scoring and the revealing of destination cards.

I guess I belong to the minority of people here, who think that this game is way overrated.
I will play if someone suggests it, but I don't know after 4 plays if I will suggest it myself.

Theres a lot of waiting if played with 5 people, Wait.... draw two cards...get the wrong colors....wait....draw two cards...

I love the [b]Ticket to Ride[/b] games. Europe edges out the base game with the "tunnels" - I love the push-your-lick aspect it adds. Also, the frenzy of drawing cards at the end which the base game tends to lapse into doesn't occur here so easily as the routes are typically shorter.

Bought this instead of original Ticket to Ride because it says it has a more advance gameplay. So yes, look at the rating I gave. Why I love it? Well, it's fun laying out those trains and finding your path to your destinations. Strategy is high enough to make me plan my movement up ahead. Picking up some right destination tickets is surely the core to win this. It's less forgiving because of the train station you can build. It's easy to learn. Some quarrelling over railways will oftenly occurs, but trust me...it's the most peaceful and quiet person on the table that usually wins the game. 

I love how the long destination routes is different from each other so people won't oftenly got clashed together fighting for the railways. Insist players to keep their long destination ticket, unless you want to play a game from hell keep just the short routes. 

This has been a house favorite. It has been played more than 5 times in a week right after I bought it.

This game is rated for family, but I will recommend this to be played with kids above 10 because there will be a tense fight after someone blocked your way. My cousin who rarely curse can just shout "damn it" after her sister blocked all her path and it's hilarious. So, buy this. This too has a legendary status on my collection.

On par with Ticket to Ride, with the following changes: 1) A different map. (Europe, you may have heard of it.) 2) "Ferry" routes REQUIRE one or more wildcards in the mix. 3) "Tunnel" routes may require an additional train card to complete. 4) Train stations may be placed on cities allowing the station owner to choose one connecting route and act as if it is their own for destination ticket purposes. MAP. The map uses city names other than what we Americans call those cities, so it takes a little getting used to. It has no 5-car length routes, strangely enough, but it does have a 8-car tunnel. FERRIES. Ferries are kind of pointless. The small ferry routes are good, but for the large routes what's the big deal about spending a wildcard you probably would have spent anyway? TUNNELS. Tunnels add an element of arbitrary punishment I don't like. You draw three cards from the pile. For each card drawn that matches the color of the train cards you played, this tunnel requires you play an additional matching card or wildcard. If you can't afford these extra train cards, you have to take back your cards/trains and lose your turn. Adds a small cost increase and gambling element to the game, but nothing major or all that appealing. And as for the train stations -- this is the only part of the game I consider an improvement. Each city can hold one station only, and each player has three stations. Unplayed stations are worth four points. Stations add more choices, allowing new strategies for piggy-backing on an opponent's route. My suggestion? If you have the original Ticket to Ride, use that and make your own train stations. TTR:Europe is a good game, and kicks a little life into one of the more overplayed games in my collection. I prefer the purity of the original.

Can't go past the TtR series! This is an excellent game to have in the collection, as it usually goes down very well with new players, and also holds up well to repeated plays. The TtR games play so well in my opinion because they maintain the players' interest throughout the game by allowing for a great mix of short, medium- and long-term planning and achievement of goals.

Some comments on specifics of the game, particularly the elements distinguishing the Europe version from the original:

The routes seem more well-balanced than the USA map, and the ticket selection process is also much fairer (everyone having the chance to take one, and only one, long route).

At an initial glance stations may seem like a cheap way out, but in practice they are well-balanced in terms of cost (points+cards), and help make drawing of tickets late in the game a more tempting option - a definite plus in my opinion.

I didn't think much of tunnels when I first read how they worked, but they aren't as bad as I thought - a bad card draw can be harsh, but it does add a bit of extra drama to the game. When someone's trying to claim a tunnel, it tends to grab everyone's attention while the cards are flipped over.

This is a tighter game than the original.  There's a lot more competition for the routes and players can get blocked out quickly if they're not careful.

As a newcomer to the hobby, surrounded primarily by non-gamers, I've begun to grow a collection with the aim of progressing toward the somewhat heavier games that seem to appeal to me. I'm still developing my own tastes, but things like Power Grid, Goa, Tikal, BaM, etc., peak my interest. I'm hoping to chart a course that starts off with lighter weight games.

For me, Ticket to Ride: Europe has already worked remarkably well. I opened it on Christmas Eve and played a game with my brother and his wife - neither of whom particularly enjoy games. It went down very well. Three days later, with two additional players, we played Bohnanza followed by TtR:E. The new players asked where they could get both games. The next day, with 4 different players, I introduced TtR:E again, with the same result - everyone enjoyed it, and each couple asked where they could get a copy. The day after that my brother (who didn't care for games) asked to borrow TtR:E to play with some guests. He's also asked where he can get his own copy. I'd call that a good start.

Ticket to Ride: Europe is a good game. I don't mind playing, and I have no problem suggesting it (in fact, I wish it supported more players). And - while I don't find it particularly stimulating - I was surprised by the amount of tension it produced in the other players. For some reason, they all seemed to get deeply invested into the game. I wish I could say the same, but it still felt good seeing how much they liked it.

Only one play, but I fail to see how this improved upon the original. And I don't see how someone who didn't like the original is going to somehow appreciate this version more. The "station" marker which prevents one from getting locked out of a segment removes one of the key components of the original for me; The tension of whether I might get squeezed out and should I act now and risk telegraphing my plans?  The added conditions of having to play additional cards for tunnels I feel also defeats the elegance of the original. Finally, the new map may address some of the perceived issues with the original map, but I've not yet played it enough to form a solid opinion on that, but after my initial play, I didn't see an obvious improvement. But then I don't see any issues with the original map either.

Adquirí el otro monstruo de la iniciación a los juegos de mesa para jugones, y desde entonces lo prefiero frente a Catán para los acercamientos de mis invitados menos jugones a los juegos de mesa. Muy vistoso, sencillo y con una mecánica muy rápida de coger.

Tiene la ventaja de que, si bien en Catán puedes equivocarte gravemente en la colocación inicial y eso lastrará tu juego toda la partida, en Aventureros al Tren es más asequible hacer unos primeros turnos de acercamiento y aun así, quedar en una posición digna o incluso luchar por la victoria.

Yo tengo la versión Europa, y las reglas de túneles y estaciones en mi opinión meten un punto de complicación que puede ser difícil de coger para aquellos que vienen de monopoly o del tute. Hay que valorar si eliminarlas.

This used to be the gateway game of choice I pulled to entice non-gamers, because the rules are so short. But it hasn't worked out: potential gamers find it too simple, while non-gamers aren't enticed by the theme (plastic trains aren't cool for a lot of people). There is also such a thing as simple gameplay obscuring the appearance and value of strategy.

With all TTR games, I get into it and like the game once we start playing, but I will rarely request to play it. Europe is more troublesome than the other TTR to teach, due to the one-locomotive rule when taking from the table, ferries, tunnels and stations, and this matters because every little new rule adds up when you're teaching to non-gamers. Tunnels are stupid. Not sure I like the stations (screwed means SCREWED!). Weakness of this (and all TTR games) is that the game is a tad too quiet to let non-gamers have a good time.

Oh, and I got the Europe version, because I thought it'd be cool to brush up on my European geography. Guess what? Americans don't give a rat's ass about learning geography. Better stick to the original TTR if you're teaching non-gaming Americans! They're already unfamiliar enough with the premise of strategic board games; the map can be a calming reference point for them.

I have too many copies of Ticket to Ride, but selection of which to play goes like this:
If the guest players have played USA many times, I love to bring out either Marklin or Europe.  They both layer on "just a little bit more".

RATING: 6
After two plays, I am decidedly underwhelmed with the new edition.  Perhaps I have just not cracked the strategy of this game yet and the score will go up after a couple of plays?  I do like the way the destination tickets are handled in this one.  However, the stations seem to make it too easy to complete tickets, essentially removing blocking as a strategic option.  In addition, the lack of many long routes makes route-claiming an ineffective strategy as well.  [6]

One of the great gateway games combining set collection with area control simply and effectively. Although gameplay can get a little programmed the area control component allows gamesmanship to upset the balance and gives it longevity. Lovely board and components draws people to the game rather than run as most train themed games would do.

This was our gateway game, a friend introduced us to this game years ago and we were hooked. We have since used it with friends and family who weren't gamers and they enjoy it.

2 games. 

Great games for people who are confused with too many rules and I've played with just these kind of people so it was great. The game feels tense (push your luck feel) without actually giving you a lot decisions to make. So you kinda roll along. Intuitive gameplay, clear objections. Only after the game I realised there's not a lot of game in there, but hey, for certain groups probably the best choice. 

I personally prefer European map over American, firstly we are from Europe, secondly I like stations and ferries. It moves the game from being cut throat to calculating risks (from tactical to a bit more strategic). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game scales well. When playing with new people you can take out the stations and build tunnels using normal rules.  Then introduce these back into the game once everyone is familiar with the care game.  The game also feels much more balanced than the original TTR.  Every player gets a long route so everyone has the potential to make about the same number of points from their tickets.  My main complaint is the abundant grouping of tunnels in one area of the board can add difficulty but the point values of routes through those areas do not reflect that difficulty.  Also I personally prefer the US map better, but that may be because I live in the US and played that version first.  I can't point to anything in particular on the US map that is better than the Europe map.

I love this game. Whether you are playing very competitively trying to shut others out of their routes, or you are just happily trying to finish your tasks, your heart beats excitedly about the possibilities.

Great fun for every. Have super serious strategists and casual people play in the same game and it does not matter, the casuals do not lose hope and strategists can plan, connive, block, and fight for victory the hole time. I find games with 3 or more people a lot of fun but 2 player seems to be a more intense game of actual trying to figure out what the other play is trying to do so you can stop them while doing what you need to do. The underground tracks add a gable aspect to the game that Ticket to Ride did not have that I think makes it a little more interesting.

Hmm, I can't believe there's a 4-year gap between my plays of Ticket to Ride: Europe. It's a fairly good gateway game which combines set-collection with route building. There's quite a lot of luck involved in the route cards and train cards that turn up, but the decisions on which route to aim for does matter in the end.

Love it, love it ,love it! So simple but so much fun!! Tom and I are always rating our games in different categories and this is my number 1 for fun!! Get it...play it ...and have some fun!

We play with a few house rules as well:

...Score your destinations as you complete them (can see who is winning as the game unfolds)

...Keep your destinations dealt to you at the start of the game in 2, 3 and 4 player games (adds more tension in trying to complete your routes)

...In 2 player games deal 4 short routes and 1 long route to each player with 5 train cards at the start ,keeping all. (even more tension to complete)

...Take off the 4 points for a station as you use it.

...Maximum hand size is 15 cards

...All pass a short destination to the player on your left to keep if at least 1 person agrees.

We have played TtR many , many times implementing these changes and believe they just make a great game even better!!

Update: 2p game-fill destination tickets for a dummy player to at least 40 trains.Have these take the shortest routes possible.This simply makes the board more crowded for your game.Super!

2p:20 mins. 3p:30 mins. 3+p:40+ mins.

[4 plays] Slightly more complicated than the original Ticket to Ride. Perhaps less approachable to beginners because of the additional rules and geography that may be less comfortable for the average American.

The map, with turn of the century spellings of place names, may be a difficulty or an impediment to fun for some people. But we've enjoyed the new map, improved route distributions, the bigger cards, and enjoyed all of the new mechanics introduced.

The ultimate gateway game. I have played this game hundreds of times, and I doubt I will ever tire of it. The train stations make this version much more forgiving than the original. The cards are also standard sized instead of tiny. Will rarely choose to play regular USA if this is version is also available.

More Ticket to Ride goodness. I find the map messier and less elegant. The new elements (stations, tunnels and ferries) just add more 'chrome' and reduce the overall simplicity of the original.

I like the larger train cards (a very nice touch) and the fact that you get 1 long route card and 2 short ones. 

There are only 2 really long lines and more than 80% of the lines are short (2-4 train lengths).

Nothing really new to justify buying a copy.

A very fun and confrontational set collection game. The board plays pretty nicely with two players, but starts to get really mean and stressful with an increased player count. Offers some tough decisions on when and where to start building your routes and whether it is worth it to break up your own plans to stop someone else. The stations keep the game from being too mean, and allow for a little more leeway on connecting tickets, which is nice.

Лучшая из коротких игр!!! Очень хороша на двоих, особенно Америка! Европа лучше на  троих, зато даже на четверых в игре нет хаоса - поля хватает для напряженной игры всех игроков.
В сравнении с Северной Америкой, карта играется совершенно по другому. К ней надо привыкнуть. Она труднее к освоению. Хороши новшества: большие маршруты, станции (их особенно не хватает стартовой игре). Тунели и паромы тоже игру не портят. Но ощущение от игры, как это не странно, несколько другое, если сравнивать её с Северной Америкой - у Америки более простая карта, в Европе менее очевидные маршруты - из них меньше тех, которые "вкладываются" один в другой, а значит и набор Тикетов, более опасен и сложен нежели в первой игре серии.

Stand alone variant of the original game.

Set in Europe with 3 main additions of Ferries (which need 1 or more locos), Tunnels (where you may need more cards than you originally put down), and stations (where you can 'steal' anothers route into a city). Plus bigger train and destination cards.

Still easy to learn and teach. Same rating for me as original...

Played online at DoW.  So far I have liked the set of tickets available, the layout of the map and the new little features.  My impression of tunnels is less favorable - introducing a bit too much randomness for me - but it is generally a manageable risk.  One thing I noticed was a lot more ticket pulling (and if I had been brave and lucky at the end there, I would have won).

The best of the TTR series in my opinion.  Far more competition for routes than the American map, and I think Marklin adds too many dynamics that detract from the core game.  A lot of fun, especially with four or five.  Still works well with two or three, however.

RATING: 7
Much better than I expected. Simple, exciting and even a bit tactical. Can even become rather cut-throat.

It has been compared to Catan by some people I know, but I think it's much better. You can "hold" your bad luck by hoarding cards, and can mitigate it with the use of stations. Also the bits are much neater than Catan. The best gateway game in my opinion, maybe tied by Carcassonne.

Not convinced that this is better than the original, but I like it. I'm yet to decide whether I prefer to play without stations, since blocking other players become much harder. Haven't played much though, so we'll see.

A nice update of TtR, which was one of our favorite games of the year.  Decisions are more difficult and our games seem to be much closer and more hotly contested.  Most of the time, the winner of the "Longest Train" route is a deciding factor in the victory.  Use of tunnels and ferrys are a welcome addition, although the tunnel rules don't seem quite right (try tunnel, and get told it requires 3 cards instead of four, then just try tunnel again next turn and get the same tunnel for 3 again....)  Train stations are a nice "cost/benefit" mechanism encouraging the taking of additional tickets.  It would have been nice to see more than just 6-7 "long train" routes, as the "I know what route you have" factor comes into play pretty easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This version of Ticket to Ride solves a lot of the balance issues I experienced with the core game. Long route cards are distributed evenly among players, there are fewer long segments of track (no segments of length five, two of length six, and one of length eight), and train stations mitigate the effect of blocking routes. I enjoyed the additional tunnel, train station, and locomotive-specific track mechanics.

Blocking routes was very easy in certain cases in the core game; when a player decides to do so, it can be difficult or impossible to complete routes. Route blocking still impacts players by forcing the use of a train station. However, this leads to four less points for that player, rather than potential 40+ point swings. Route-blocking really saps enjoyment out of the game for some people I regularly play with, though I understand other groups may enjoy the conflict.

Az alapjáték Európában, vasútállomásokkal, alagutakkal és kompokkal megbolondítva. Nagyon szép kivitelezésben.

Az állomások érdekesebbé teszik a játékot. Nagyobb eséllyel vállal be valaki útvonalhúzást így, mint az alapjátékban. Igaz ezzel a szerencse szerepe is megnő, mert jó húzás esetén sok pontot gyűjthet a játékos 1-2 állomás lehelyezésével, rossz esetben viszont gyűlnek a mínuszok.
Mivel kisebb a pálya, így azt találták ki, hogy csak hat nagy útvonal kártya van és több kicsi. Szerintem ez fölösleges volt. Jobb lett volna, ha marad az eredeti játék szerinti egyforma útvonalkártya, különböző hosszú útvonalakkal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a bit more of a complex version to the original Ticket to Ride, we really enjoy the map.  While the two player needs some tweaking (i.e. 1912 expansion), we felt the addition of tunnels/ferries along with the option of stations (we often leave this rule out when teaching the game) really enhances this game over the original.

I understand that this is a very well made game, but unfortunately it doesn't "get me".

RATING: 6
Pretty fun, heard the wide open map and stations made this map pretty passive and non-cutthroat so I avoided it in favor of every other TTR map for a long time. Maybe true. There are still quite a bit of short routes though so cutthroat play can work somewhat in 2 player I think, even if this is the least cutthroat board, but cutthroat potential is probably more ticket dependent than other boards where it's pretty much always an option

Yeah, I think Stations are a little pansy! Crowded games still feel crowded though, so that's good

RATING: 2
Another classic case of subtraction by addition.  While not a big fan of the original, I feel it works well enough as a light intro game, but this game feels absolutely random.  The base mechanic in both of the games is Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Play, kind of boring (and random if you are waiting for what you need) but whatever.  

This new version is worse, because it adds awkward requirements to the randomness.  In this there are routes that require wild cards, but if you don't ever have to chance to get a wild card you cannot do a thing about it, you just draw waiting for the game to end.  

If you aren't constrained enough by the drafting choices, now there is a new rule to add randomness -- tunnels.  Now you never know if you are going to actually get to build, so planning is pretty much thrown out the window.  If you don't have enough cards to cover random extra payments to build the game incorporates the worst mechanic you can incorporate in any game, you lose your turn.  So, rather than risk losing your turn you can take two or three extra turns to countermand the absurd luck.  

I was hoping that this game would solve some of the problems of the previous game, but this again has the same petering endgame where people feel that they have nothing significant to do for the last 4 or 5 turns.  My time is better spent doing just about anything else, than waste my time on this dross.

Ticket To Ride is zo'n typisch spel dat bijna iedereen wel kan bekoren. De eenvoud van de regels, de spanning om je bestemmingen te halen en het dwarsbomen van je medespelers maken van dit bordspel een kanjer. De speeltijd blijft ook lekker strak en daar door is de optie van "nog een spelletje?" erg groot.

Bij Ticket To Ride proberen spelers op een map steden door middel van treinroutes met elkaar te verbinden. Die routes bestaan uit kleuren, die de speler met het verzamelen en afleggen van de juiste kleur kaarten moet behalen. Het spel is zo opgebouwd dat elke stad meerdere keren in het bestemmings deck kan voorkomen. Hierdoor weten spelers nooit van elkaar of ze wel de enige zijn die bepaalde stad of route moeten aandoen. Daardoor moet je vaak weer op zoek naar een andere mogelijkheid om je steden te verbinden en je natuurlijk weer andere spelers begint te dwarsbomen enz... Op het einde worden namelijk punten afgetrokken van routes die niet voltooid zijn. 

Ticket To Ride is diverse variaties verkrijgbaar,  meestal andere mappen met verschillende werelddelen en steden. Er zijn bij elke expansion ook kleine spelvariaties mogenlijk op de basis regels.

I have played this a couple of times and have found it to be a light but very fun game. Players are faced with taking one of three actions on every turn, and must weigh decisions of claiming new routes with gambling to take more destination tickets while playing a little defense to recognize opponents' routes and blocking if appropriate.  I like the additional rules of the tunnels and stations added, though it does seem to make the game less cutthroat than the original.

Used to have it -- gave it as a gift to the in-laws when we visited them. A map with much more crouded and shorter legs than in the US version makes it a somewhat different game to play, with much less room for strategic maneur, and much less time to accumulate all the 5s and 6s you want to play. I liked smaller car cards in the US version better.

"Everybody in their childhood has dreamed about piloting a train. Choo choo!"

Mind you, design wise this is a perfect game, although a touch too simple for me, to give it a perfect score.
I consider it a great entry level game, a little more complicated than USA and this is for the good. Those additional rules keep the gamer in me interested; so, granted this is not a game that i would take on the table often whenever i play with my gamer friends, it is definitely one that i pull out to play with my family.

My group likes this one a great deal. I like it too, but it's a 7.5 kinda like. It's fun for sure, and makes for a great game to bring out with non-gamers. The awesome part is that after the game we often lament about how "i was trying to do this" and "oh man, i almost got that" - fun aftertalk. Note that my rating is only true if played with gamers who are not of the "I will screw you every chance I get" variety. It can end up a simple block-fest if played with these types of gamers, so we play it much less confrontationally. Much like the Settlers of Catan, this game suffers from a high luck mechanic (flipping cards), although in this game it is much, much less frustrating than in the former - mainly because in Settlers you can immediately see how others benefit from certain die rolls and how you get skunked, whereas in Ticket to Ride the effect of an opponents card flip may not be readily apparent to you. The mechanic of rolling dice or flipping cards is very attractive to non or new gamers because it gives one the anticipatory feeling of being on the edge of one's seat waiting to see if their color/number will come up. This makes for a fun, exciting time at first, but in time begins to pale and become more of a frustrating and very uninspiring (and even "cheap and easy" seeming) game mechanic and design choice.

Truly a great game! Played well over a 100 times on the Europe map alone (probably around 200 plays for the series as a whole) and still a regualar and welcome game to my gaming table.
It's a racing game disguised as a set collecting and route building game. The ending is always nailbiting. Quite a feat for a game played over a 100 times! Will I finish all my destination tickets in time? Damn, I need just one more yellow card! Oh no, these tickets I drew are no good! Can I make a detour? 
It's a lighter, family style game, with a luck element in drawing tickets and the coloured cards. Still, timing your moves and positioning yourself on the board well wins you the game more often than not.
As a houserule, we don't use the stations and we mix in the long routes with the regular ones: the different coloured backs offer more information when drawing tickets and there happers to be a long route on top, but the risk is also greater. Trying to link three long routes and succeeding is the best way to win!

Besides being a great game, as it really is a lot of fun to play, it's also the best gateway game. Period.

I know that this is a stellar gateway game, but the more I think about it, the more that this is really just like Rummy on crack: you're basically collected sets of like-colored cards in order to build your routes.

I don't like most of the new changes to the game in Ticket to Ride: Europe.  The shift of focus to smaller routes, the stations, and the tunnels all move away from what I absolutely loved about the main game.  The long, hard to get routes were exciting to chase after and compete for, the fear of being blocked off from a route you need for a major ticket added exquisite tension, and when you did achieve something you knew there wasn't another random element to throw a wrench in the works.  The tunnels are the least offending of the new changes but I feel they were only added to arbitrarily increase the difficulty due to the loss of so many 5-6 train routes.

All that said the main game that I love is still mostly intact and a new map of routes is a welcome addition to make the game new and fresh again.

Simple and reasonable fun train game. Most important are the mission cards, if you draw the right ones you will win, or maybe more on the point, if you don't get any god, fitting mission you will have to spend turns trying to find one while the oppositions are building rail and winning the game. Stations makes the game "easier" than the original and missions more possible to complete.

Oh, I love me some route planning and this is the perfect game for that with long, long (and some shorter) train routes to build across a last century Europe. Set collecting is a mechanism I like, this game is light but the ending can come very tense when you are not sure whether you will be able to finish all your routes.
I am aware that some think this game is too solitary but I obviously do not mind that, and yes, had a phase being very addicted to this. Right now I don't own a copy but hope that will change, maybe I will opt for one of the variants instead to try something slightly different.
Own a copy and still love it, whereas Settlers has lost some of its appeal for me over the years, I am still 100% into this.

It has got it all:-  theme, nice board, easy to learn, little bit of luck, luck ironed out by optimal game play, trains, tension towards end of game. Gateway game? Yes but unlike some other gateways it's one that i want to keep playing. I class online games as plays. 28/2/08 - i just played online against someone who had logged 18,000 plays - thats say 6,000 hours, 500 days at 12 hours a day. Speechless. 2/3/08 - 5 on the spin. PG addiction move over!

Since I actually think this is the best version of those I tried it should be higher at my wishlist. However I rarely play any TTR game since I have in my opinion better games in the collection.

RATING: 8
Always fun to play. I'm of the belief that when you don't have anything better, you should always opt to take 2 cards of the same color rather than draw cards. My only gripe with the game is that you often get stuck with cards that, no matter what, you will never use. It seems a waste. I wish there were some sort of trade element or a way to discard the useless cards for an equal number of new cards or one less or something. Other than that, this is a great game.

Takes the original TTR design and improves it.  Besides the 10th anniversary edition this is my favorite TTR edition.  I wish they would make an upgraded version of Europe similar to the 10th anniversary edition for the original TTR.  It would be my new number one easily!

Very nice fast paced light game to play with non gamers or beginners. Some strategy, some luck, lots of little decisions.

RATING: 7
Bah, so many people are pleased with this, but every time I play it I feel less interested.  Is it just that the train theme that turns me off?  Or maybe it's the mechanic of geographic set collection over two hours that sort of makes me snooze?  It's a nicely done game, but it just doesn't get me excited.     

Update:  Raised to a 7.  Perhaps age is mellowing me, but I kind of liked this last time I played it.  It's competitive, tense, yet still laid back (if that's possible).  You,re alright, TtR.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
A laid-back, straightforward game that is easy to grasp. Doesn't have very many difficult decisions. Good mix of control and randomness with the multiple routes per city, the blind draw of trains, and anticipation of other players' turns.

Loved the addition of stations. I think they are a bit expensive to use, but in a bind, they are useful for freeing up a route that might otherwise not be accessible for you.

Ferries are a pretty useless addition to the game in my opinion. Tunnels on the other hand add a bit more anticipation and excitement as each card is turned over form the top of the draw deck. Always fun to see someone trying to build an 8 train tunnel to Stockholm.

Leisurely starts build up to a very tense endgame. Plenty of options abound, and strategic use of stations make for a variety of interesting tactics, while remaining a fun and FRIENDLY game.

RATING: 7
It's a quick, light, fun game.  Not my favorite, but quite accessible for non-gamers.  Yes, given reasonably even play the winner will largely be determined by chance, but I don't believe that's a bad thing in a quick, light game.  Winning isn't as big a deal for this game as it is in some others.  If I fill my tickets and lose, I've still had a fun time.

RATING: 5
Pretty ok I think. We would need one of the smaller maps that work better for 2 and 3 players to get this to the table more often.

Good game to bring out when you have a bunch of non-gamer friends over and you want to play somethings that's not a party-game.

UPDATE 2017-06-30: The main problem with Ticket to Ride as a gateway game, for me, is that it's not in any genre I really like very much. Which means that if I'm introducing someone to modern boardgames using Ticket to Ride, whether or not they like Ticket to Ride doesn't really say much on whether they might like the games I really like…

It remains in my shelf for now, but I wouldn't replace it if I lost it.

In many ways an improvement over basic Ticket to Ride, but at the same time I usually have more fun playing the original.  I'm not sure why that is.  I found that express trains were a little hard to come by, but that was probably bad luck.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a lot of fun, a good deal of strategic options (may favorite is train card hoarding), and everyone's favorite part of that it's FAST paced.  My biggest criticism of this game is that one person may randomly get a part of the board to themselves making it a solitaire game for them with little interaction.  So it's best with max number of players.
My wife continues to love this game, and it's great to play with other couples.

The Europe edition of Ticket to Ride adds a couple more interesting aspects to the game, but not enough to really capture my imagination.  I initially thought these new elements made the game slightly more fun, until I played the Marklin edition and realized that I was feeling a little relieved at not having to think about tunnels and ferries (although the tunnels do add some brief moments of tension and could have been kept).  The train stations seem to take away from the competitiveness of the game by giving a player an "out" if s/he gets stuck, and should perhaps have more value at the end of the game if unplayed.  All in all, I personally thought that TTR: Marklin had the highest fun factor of the three.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5/10

For some reason I don't like this as much as the original Ticket To Ride.

I like the additions of tunnels to the base TtR game.  Plus, I really like the ability to use train stations to help complete tickets.  That's been key in a number of games played in our group.

If you can only afford one version of Ticket to Ride (as I was in the position of being at first) this is the strongest choice in my opinion. The cards are full-sized, Long Routs and Short Routs are separated out (greatly lessening the luck factor), and the stations make it easier to take when someone cuts you off.

I like the added complexity that the tunnels & ferries provide in this version.  The added option of the train stations not only provide a nice out when trying to complete an impossible ticket but also add a new layer of strategy because they can give you an easy way of completing tickets at a cost of only 4 victory points.  Nice addition!

RATING: 7.5
[DoW 2005 edition] {Trains; drafting, connection, set collection; optimal 4-5p} A good family game for all kinds of players. I will introduce this game to genera players to let them enter the world of board games. Days of Wonder is gifted to produce beautiful games. This is no exception: parts are very beautiful and durable. My friends love this game already by its outlook. 

TtR:E has different feels for 2-3p and 4-5p players. In a 4-5p game, the value of each route increase vastly and the game will be more competitive and thus funnier. TtR:E is not a deep game but it still provides multiple ways of scoring, decisions between attacks or defense, etc. Nonetheless, players can usually make the decision easily. It's important to collect train cards. More cards give a player more tactic alternatives. However, there is a problem that players may hoard cards actively and the flow of the game may seriously be disrupted when no one is willing to place trains. This won't happen much for casual gamers, though. Another problem is that the value of each route is not well tuned. Some routes are clearly more important than others and everyone will try to claim that early. Another problem is that the values of tickets are not well-tuned; some tickets are more valuable than others and it's easy for a player to claim many tickets around a particular route and region and win the game easily. Nevertheless, the rule of TtR:E is better than Ticket to Ride: additional kinds of routes and stations so that a player is not easily blocked when all their wanted routes are occupied.

After a few plays, I have to say that I really don't like the tunnels. Adds an unnecessary luck element. And the mandatory use of locomotives feels tacked on. The only new element that I do like is the stations.

Now that the much better Marklin is out, I'm not sure that I'll ever play this one.

A game to play with people who are used to rolling a die and doing what it tells them, it gently introduces them to the notion of making a decision every turn. Of course, it's not [i]much[/i] of a decision, so gamers can find it a little difficult to stay awake. I suggest playing nasty: block every plan you can. Best to play without stations - not only are they too complicated to explain (to the intended audience) their abscence also rewards players with a little foresight, and you might even get lucky and see someone cry.

The new features have, to me, diluted the essence of this game. If TTR was the game that you can explain to non-gamers in 2 minutes then stations, tunnels and ferries only detract from that ethos.

I find the idea that this is a totally different experience from Ticket to Ride to be absurd.  Instead, I think this is Ticket to Ride with a new map and some of the problems with the game fixed.  I do think that most non-gamers (Americans) should be started with Ticket to Ride as the European map might turn some people off.

I own both and don't regret that, but I will only play the origial over Europe in order to teach new players.  

Both are top of the line non-gamer games.

This is significantly worse than TTR. The tunnels and ferries make it more luck-dependend without offering anything interesting. Plus, the shorter tracks between the cities increase the competition to complete them as soon as possible - this also makes luck a more important factor since card-drawing becomes more important.
The stations make up for it to some extent. But not to full extent.

The cool thing about TTR:E is that you can learn the names of major European cities in the respective languages.

The best board game I own for non-gamers to introduce them to boardgames. Very simple rules. Everyone can get them in less then 5 minutes. After 1 or 2 rounds everyone will be familiar with them. This game has some luck factor which helps new players to beat veterans. Game gets boring after 15  games. One board and almost no interaction between players kills this game in long run. But it is great family game and introduction title for non-gamers. Highly recomanded!

Too bad the stations doesnt encourage route blocking, maybe need to remove them for low count of players.
This TTR is good for 4 or 5 players, definitely not going to play them for lower than 4 player, I bought india and switzerland map collection for 2p or 3p game.

This game just doesn't do it anymore. Have had enough of placing trains and the light mechanics aren't fun anymore. Maybe the Alvin and Dexter expansion will change my opinion but to be honest: I don't think so. 
Nice way into boardgaming and will still see some playing time with boardgame 'newcomers' and some friends who are hooked on the game.

Variation of the orginal, with some added rules.  However, I am not sure that the alterations make the game any better, just different.  The addition of tunnels and ferries certainly make line building more of a challenge, which takes away one of the great enjoyments of the US version.  But the addition of Stations also creates the possibility of getting back what has been denied.  So the sum of all the changes means that it is more or less the same as the original but doesn't flow quite as smoothly.  The same, only different.

Took a while to decide which TTR to purchase, but I think we made the right call with Europe.  Really enjoying this, but the 1912 expansion was more or less essential to get a few more tickets into the mix too.
Also thinking of purchasing the Switzerland expansion or Nordic Countries for an improved 2/3 player game, but that is proving difficult at present...

EDIT Sep-2011: Have since added the Dice Expansion and Alvin&Dexter.  Still popular for teaching newbies.

Well, I think that this game fixed most of the problems for the first version released with the USA map. First of all the game take place in Europe! ;-) Second the objective card are well balanced, divided into two kind (short and long route). Third the longest roads (8 and 6 track) are fewest than before. Good one for new players to be addicted to boardgames.

Just as good as the original if not more so. The big cards are nice and the new additions add some flavor. The biggest improvement seems to be the balancing of the long routes.

Everyone should own a copy of Ticket to Ride. It is one of the most accessible "real" board games there is.

RATING: 8
Great game, easy to learn and play. Very strategic as you can only take one action per turn. It definitely builds up the tension as you wait for your turn to come around and hoping no one foils your plans to build the railway to bring you to the win. This version of the game introduces train stations which allows players to utilize the routes claimed by other players to complete their objectives; however, you do not get to count those trains towards your total points. The less train stations you use, the better (as they are worth points in the end). This version also introduces tunnels which may result in a route segment being much longer than anticipated!

RATING: 9
Ticket to ride is an easy game to play. On your turn, you either pick two cards, or place trains. There are some constraints on those two actions, but that is basically it.

But, the game is perfect for the whole family and casual gamers. No need to worry about the rules. You can just focus on playing.

Not a lot of tough decisions, but it does provide excitement when everybody wants the same routes, trying to find an alternative that could provide you with an advantage.

For me the challenge comes from trying to connect all my routes to obtain the longest train bonus, while completing all my cards, and using all of my trains. And trying to guess where to other players are going to avoid getting blocked.

RATING: 4
Only purpose, I played this so often (and will play it in the future), is that it is among the favourite games of some of my regular gaming group, and I enjoy their company so much, I will give in on request.

But I think, the choices are really limited most of the time. To often you can only draw two random cards from top of the deck for several consecutive turns, and this really gets boring, or even frustrating. Game drags and overstays it's welcome most of the times with me, and I'm generally not somebody with short attention span, who feels comfortable with many games much longer then this one.

Regarding this particular map: I think, the connection Stockholm - Petrograd is overpowered. Most times, the person claiming it will win the games.

After now having played all three of these the Europe version is the one that I like the least.  I will keep it for no other reason than to have the large cards available for playing the original version.  The original one is a better game for pulling out as a gateway game and Marklin is better for stepping up for seasoned players.  This one will now get lost in the shuffle.

It is a family game, but i don`t like this board for 2 and 3 players, because it`s too loosely. I know you can`t really block someone (stations), but for 4 or 5 players it feels more competitive.

Over-played this with my wife and mom. We've boiled the whole game down to this; whoever wins 2 out of 3 of the 6-8 long routes will probably win the game. Every game now becomes a race between us to see who builds these tracks, routes are now secondary. I have yet to see a strategy that can beat this. But otherwise, it's a beautiful game, and worthy of any collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Europe adds stations that mitigate blocking. In other TtR games, concerted blocking can cause a +20 to -20 point swing; in Europe a block costs -3 pts, 1-3 cards, a turn, and opportunity cost not being able to complete more tickets. The best TtR.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Its tough to say how I feel about this one, I want to like it more I really do.  It seems that there might be a slight challenge introducing those who haven't played the original to the mechanics.  The station house seems to prevent aggressive players from attempting "take that" gameplay, which I don't think is positive.  However station houses can be great for higher player games it seems.  The extra elements are abit bitey too, the tunnels element adds a risk factor and the fairys make for a higher stakes wildcard game.  That being said the game is basically the same as the original in most ways, I could play either quite happily!

An incredibly tight variation on Ticket to Ride that at the same time leads to less of the confrontation that the original had, due to the presence of the stations.  An ingenious idea that prevents some of the hard feelings some would get by blocking, while still preserving the need to grab key routes as soon as possible, since unused stations are worth bonus points.

No hay fin de semana que no juguemos una partida a este juego. Rápido y sencillo pero a la vez tenso. Un juego muy agradable, sobretodo para finalizar una noche de juego./// Le bajo la nota  un punto porque comienzan a repetirse demasiado los recorridos largos. Hay zonas del mapa que son significativamente más complicadas que otras y, para colmo, te reportan muchos menos puntos que otras: me refiero a la zona de del norte de italia y alrededores. Sigue siendo un juego ligero y agradable de jugar, pero hay que huir de esa parte del mapa que me parece más un tropiezo que otra cosa. Quizá el mapa EE.UU. sea más abierto y ofrezca las mismas posibilidades de ganar a los jugadores.

The stations in TTR:Europe are a great addition that makes the game so much less cutthroat than the original. I found the game very relaxed and everyone had a good time.

This game goes over well with just about everyone. Turns fly by at a very nice pace, and there is a pleasant amount of tension - can I make my routes before they're blocked?  - Should I take tickets, even though I will loose tempo doing it, and risk getting bad ones? - Do I take the joker, that I know I can use, or gamble that something good is in the deck? All within quite a short timeframe - excellent!

I played USA first, then bought this for my wife.  We have tons of plays on it and it's always a good time.  2 Player it is a little to wide open, leading to no conflict, but still a great lighter game for those you're trying to ease in to gaming.

RATING: 7.5
Ticket to Ride with some extra rules. I like it a bit more than the original game - stations give you some more options and tunnels add a push your luck element. It seems a bit more luck based due to the tunnels but a bit more forgiving due to the stations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much preferred to the original with its wide open map, and lack of difficult routes. The addition of ferries/tunnels/stations make the choices slightly more interesting without increasing the difficulty. A great game, but with prices climbing north of $70CAD, it's hard to recommend to friends as a gateway. It's just too pricey and can run too long. I much prefer Camel Up or Broom Service as a gateway introduction. Plus, although harder to find, the price point is much more reasonable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interaction isn't too high in this game. More like accidental blockage that can easily be worked around. I like this game with 3 or 5 players. Finish tickets and build to finish the game fast seems to be my favorite strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really believe this game should be played with a minimum of 3 players. It's an easy concept to grasp and thus a good gateway game. There is a high luck factor and that doesn't sit well with hardcore gamers. I find it sits on my shelf unless I am trying to convert non-gamers. It's all about collecting sets and building routes. Most Americans will have trouble with the countries and this can make the game drag a bit while people check their routes. It's a good gateway game, but only a gateway game.

RATING: 9
Not only the best "gateway" game ever created, the TTR series might have the best rules of any game in recent history. The games are simple, play quickly, have great components, and offer a ton of fun choices. The European version is slightly more complicated than the American version, but still increadibly simple. The changes in the European version make scoring with a lot of destination tickets a more viable strategy than in the American version. It is also harder to block your opponent, so this version doesn't feel as cut-throat. Despite being slightly more complicated, I think the changes in this version make it easier for kids and novices to win.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good, but a bit of better balancing would have been better.  Specifically, if you can play the east side of the map it is highly preferable because that is where all the longer length tracks (thereby better from a points perspective) reside.  Also, I dislike the long/short Destination ticket scheme of the original game.  I have the 1912 expansion on the way, and hope that the 'Big Cities' game will cure these (in my opinion) drawbacks.  However, I loved the addition of stations in TtRE.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I prefer the original to this game. The new game play elements are fun to play, but with the limited number of long tickets, it becomes a lot easier to figure out some of the routes that others are going for.  This can severely handicap a less experienced player.  The train stations are a nice addition, but make play less confrontational.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Curiously popular with the friends that I game with. I find that it's altogether too random in terms of gameplay: you are at the mercy of the cards, and in the closing stages of the game, it ceases to be fun turning over card after card in the desperate search for the one card that will keep you in the game. Add to that the 'clumping' that frequently occurs when routes converge, and you have a recipe for a poorly spent few hours, unless you picked up a good hand.

I use this game as my gateway game for those that weren't around when I bought Citadels.  This game is great, it has the bits and the elegance to back it up, but I would recommend having exactly 4 players to play with.  That seems to be the sweet spot for me, anyway.  Anything less, go with Switzerland (but you'll need this one or the original for that anyway)!

I enjoyed Ticket to Ride, but felt like this version would be a better fit for the people that I usually want to play Ticket to Ride with.  It's true, it feels a bit less cut-throat.  I really like the distribution of the destinations better (although I probably could have gotten similar from 1910).  The route distribution will take some getting used to (all those 4-routes, no 5's, and only the 2 6's).  matching color to destination seems less important.  Short-version: it feels pretty different from America, for reasons different from what I expected.  I like it just about the same, but it's fresher, and I think the people around me will like it better.

Oddly the people around me like it less well overall, because of the difficulty of finding European cities (made more difficult with the European names rather than anglicized ones).  I think I actually like it a little better though...

I like this a bit more than the original at this point due to the greater balance in starting tickets with each player getting one long ticket.  I don't mind the congestion on the board or the stations.  I do miss the numerous 5 and 6 train routes in the original, as Europe ends up as a bunch of 2 to 4 card plays (except for tunnels, but those extra cards aren't rewarded with points).

I really enjoy the changes.  Plus I get to learn european geography, so I don't feel so American.  The changes make the gameplay less static, and interesting every time.  Actually made me lower the original one point, after realizing what this game could be.  I beleive this is the best gateway game, if the next game taught is Princes of Florence.  For some reason though, the game has worn on me, and I have little desire to play anymore.  It needs to played quite quite fast(very possible) for it to hold my attention.

I like MOST of the variants to this game...It's a nice change of pace from the original but now that DoW released the 1910 USA expansion that has become my favorite TTR again. I think the 8 train connection is a bit much....21 points is HUGE to give to ONE person....especially if they use that in a route it's just a bit overwhelming.

CSSS Game - Not really that different from the original Ticket to Ride, and not quite as good.  I wish the two version came together as a double-sided board, like Power Grid or China.  The addition of tunnels, ferries, and stations is interesting, but are definitely not worth buying a whole new game.  I think the additional rules may just add extra complexity without adding any real depth or strategy, making this a worse gateway game, but not any better as a gamer's game.

It does seem to work.

Excellent entry/family game. Rules are very simple and it's easy to get into. There is limited interaction in cock-blocking routes; I like the big playing board also. There is much comparison between Thurn and Taxis and this game and I would say this one is better suited for beginners as it has a stronger visual/physical element in the train pieces (in addition, it's ironic how both games are rather lacking without their expansion!). Although there is strategy involved there is a lot of chance in what cards you pick up to build routes. With four players there is a lot of tension with certain routes/areas getting congested, which always feels fun. What I do not like is the very limited variability in the rules. You are forced into having one of six long routes so it does become rather obvious after a few plays what people are likely to be going after. The Europa 1912 expansion addresses this and I would have to say it's an essential purchase if you like the base game.

I prefer this one to the original if playing with gamers rather than family / friends.  Not just for the extra rules - although they are fun and add a bit more weight to the decision-making, but mostly because the board is so much tighter.  More opportunities to interfere with each other's plans, and also more variation in strategy - "lots of small tickets" and "short links, longest train" both work better here than on the USA board.

 Not a game I like to play twice in a row since it's a little too simple, but from time to time it's a nice distraction.

Good with non-gamers! Have introduced it to a few now and its always worked really well (2 of them are now clamoring to get a board game of their own! THANK YOU TTR:E!) Quick, not too heavy, and a joy to play, my only complaint would be the high luck factor in choosing cards. Sometimes it feels like you are waiting forever for that one blue you need to complete a route, or you draw 5 blacks for an underground route, or whatever. This problem is largely fixed by the 5 open cards, but I thought I would mention it.

This is a great game. It can be played with anyone (kids and adults alike). And it´s a game you can recommend to new gamers to introduce them to the hobby. We like it better without the expansion.

Excellent light fare which has a deeper side after a few plays, much like the original  The stations and tunnels add variety from the original.  However, the randomness of the long routes in the original is missing, which in some ways is a shame, having only one of 6 to choose from.  However, this will probably make for cleverer play as the game is played more.

Oh, and the wife likes it too! :-)

RATING: 5
Based one on play, I am not enamored of it.  I'm very uncertain about the station mechanic, in that, if you use one or two, but other players don't, they get a point differential at the end of the game that could sink you.  While I think the long route card mandate is a good idea, the board itself works against you if you have to perform a lot of scoring to catch up or stay ahead.  There are very few 6 and 8 car routes, no 5 car routes at all.  This levels the playing field too much, I think.  As with the original TTR, I also belive it will scale well only with 4 or 5 players.  2 and 3 players games leave the board very empty and thus, no strategy is needed at all.  I would argue that the scale of the map is wrong, and needs reworking in order to produce more meaningful connections between cities.

A better sequel after Ticket to Ride America. Beautiful parts. Revised rules help balancing the game quite bit. One flaw is the inconsistence of ticket values. The game suffers also from under-estimating the tactical values of the short trains in the central western of europe. The unbalanced configuration makes it less enjoyable/replayable to serious gamers after realizing the mis-balanced elements. It does provide strategies, but I would always have access to another better game, unless playing it casually.
By the way, Ticket to Ride: Europe is defintely a good recommendation to new gamers and casual gamers. I may own a copy... if the unbalanced factors are fixed. No plan to get it yet anyway.

Game is not unlike TTR. I am not quite convinced that the additional features such as ferries, tunnels and stations make such a huge difference in the game. Of all the new features, I do like the stations best. It goes well with the game because the the map is tighter and point-scoring is closer. Hence, having stations alleviate the frustration of missing a track. Overall a decent game and I think it is a slight improvement over the original. A decent gateway game.

O.K.  I have to try to compare this to Ticket to Ride, but I'm not sure I can honestly do that yet.  My initial impression, after 1 play, is that this is a tighter, more unforgiving game, and that I like it a little more.  Its hard to be objective because I won that game by being the only person who wasn't getting screwed left and right.  Noone was trying to block, but there is was.  I know I like it at least as much as TtR, and I think despite its close relation with that game, it fills a different niche.  For example, I would not pull out Europe to teach a newbie.  I will rate it the same for now, and adjust accordingly after future plays.

I actually have much more experience with this map than with the original.  The stations are useful, the short/long route separation is an *excellent* idea, and the locomotive-required sea routes are all improvements.  The tunnels, however, seem to add unnecessary randomness.

That being said, it's still just TTR, and TTR is a bit light for my tastes these days.

Pros: gateway game with network building mechanic, easy to learn

Cons: no direct player interaction, high degree of luck, limited strategic options

A game I struggle to win, though it baffles me as to why. Pretty straightforward strategy--I seemingly always succumb to bad luck. Frustrating for not only myself but for my wife as well because you get boxed into your strategy and don't have an opportunity to switch it around. You're victim to the card draw as well--in almost every game I play, I feel like I'm simply waiting around for the right color I need to complete a route. We only ever brought it to the table if we had someone who really wanted to play and/or needed a lighter-weight game.

RATING: 7
Ticket To Ride on a Europe map that adds several main rule changes. I'm not a big fan of the additional randomness associated with the tunnel card draws - the original game (& Marklin) already have what I consider the right balance of randomness inherent in the "rummy" mechanism. I also dislike the imbalance in the map - there are very few long routes and one "super long" 8-train route. Completing that single 8-train route is a viable strategy (worth a very long ticket in points) and is often enough to put you over the top for the win. I do see the necessity for the stations, due to the tightness of the map and the ease by which you can be blocked - I appreciate their implementation. Still a decent game, as are all of the TtR variants, but the weakest of the series in my opinion.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good, gateway game but also fun for more experienced players. Not complicated but extremely gripping. Pity that most of the maps have almost always some border mistakes (compared to time showed on the ticket cards) but that is not a real problem. ; ) Good game with a lot of expansions that will keep boredom away.

I've never played the original Ticket To Ride but the 'new' features seem like good ideas. They don't save this from being mostly an exercise in route memorisation and card counting, nor do they add the dynamics the game is sorely lacking. Every turn feels the same as the last.

All around solid and fun family game, and I consider it to be the 21st century replacement for "Monopoly" -- as a game everyone who owns a couple of board games tends to have.

It's a game of building railroads, and there are several international variations. The only problem with this game is that the cell-phone app and online version, where you play against several AI opponents, is so good and fast, that you can play a game in 5-10 minutes, so you may get impatient with the 45-60 minute board game in real life once you are spoiled by the app version. 

There are many versions, with railroad systems across many countries or continents, but the Europe version is my favorite right now.

I originally started playing Ticket to Ride on my iPad as I was unsure how much re playability it would have with my gaming group and I wanted to see if it was something that my wife would like.

Turns out this is one of our favorite games and my wife loves it!

It is incredibly easy to explain (under 5 minutes), so it's always the game I take out when we have newcomers to the group. However, it never gets boring for the more experienced gamers as there is always new strategies to try (mean if you are playing against other cutthroat players, or fast and loose with the newcomers).

The component quality is very high with my only complaint being that the plastic could be just a bit heavier as it seems really easy for the trains to scoot around the board with even the lightest nudge. 

I also prefer Europe to the original game. Drawing tickets in the original can be make or break (whether or not you get a high pointer), but Europe balances that out with 2 low tickets and 1 high ticket per person. They also add train stations so that getting blocked isn't as catastrophic anymore. The map also uses the European names of cities which I found was a nice touch as it gets me into the theme even more.

A fantastic game (and a fantastic app) that I'd highly recommend to people new to games, experienced with games, or who don't even know how truly fun games can be!

Enjoyable game!  I owned Nordic already but got this version to have a game that scales up to 5 players.  Prefer this one to the original USA version because the locomotives and tunnels add much-appreciated complexity to the game.  I would not enjoy this game nearly as much without them!  Stations are a new addition in Europe.  I expected to have a "take them or leave them" opinion, but I ended up using them more than I expected.  I could still live without in a 2-3p setting, but in a 5p game they become more critical.

If you're playing with 2-3 players, I'd still recommend Nordic as the way to go.  If you want a game that can scale up to 5, go with Europe.  This one plays okay with 3, but I think I'll always enjoy Nordic more with only 2.

The only reason I'm giving this one a lower score than Nordic is because of the cards.  The Nordic cards have better artwork and feel a little more durable.  If I have to look at cards for an entire game, I'd rather be looking at the ones from Nordic.

RATING: 7.5
Not a big fan of tunnels or ferries, so the sheer number of them on this map doesn't do a lot for me, but the addition of stations (which I use with abandon on other maps) makes this one important, even if it's far from my favourite TTR map.

Simple abstract game. There's some strategy but luck has an important role. More players make it more chaotic. Fast paced. Fine quality of bits.
It has a few extra rules to improve it (some are fine, like the new initial tickets, while some simply add randomness, like tunnels).
The map has more (and shorter) routes to encourage playing more than hoarding.
Overall, slightly better than the original.

Alan R. Moon sokszoros díjnyertes játékának Európai változata. Színkódos kártyák gyűjtésével vasúti útvonalakat építhetünk és ha sikerül összekötnünk a küldetésünkben adott két várost, bónuszpontokra számíthatunk (ha viszont nem, úgy büntetőpontokra).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rated after 9 played games. A little bit too easy for my taste, usually everyone can build pretty all the routes using the stations and the tunnels are irritating. I prefer the original version, it's tougher, more competitive and more evil.

Update after tenth game, now with a more competitive group. The game felt different and not at all as family game as before. Was this a one time miracle, we will see in the future.

Add about 13 two-player games in couple of days, but the game is not at its best as two-player game. On most of the games, the map is too open and it is rather easy to finish the routes and the stations are almost useless. Ok game, finishes in 30 minutes and sometimes it is very tight.

Update after three 3-player games. The game is better with 3 than 2 players, the map is tighter and there is need for the stations. Playable with two, still.

Over 30 games, updated the rating to 7. The game is good, especially with three players.

Almost 50 plays now, I seem to have not updating the Comment or the later edits have disappeared... The game is good and with different maps it is easy to get a good play for different number of players and get some variety as well.

I played Ticket to Ride USA on the app and wasn't that impressed. The Europe edition is just enough of a step up to keep my attention much easier. The layout of the routes and the station piece work well. It's a fairly simple game, but it includes a bit of interaction/blocking and feels good to accomplish your goals. I can't really think of anything to add to this game (A rarity for me) besides more maps! 

Edit: Turning to an 8 from a 9. I mainly play this 2p with my wife and it's just OK over and over. Other maps may help.

UPDATE: The Europe map would probably be a fun, interactive game with five to six players, but is tedious with two players. Avoid. It's an hour of your life wasted sticking plastic trains in a row on a board because you rarely encounter your opponent.

I've had two plays for far... And I don't really know where I stand with this game yet.  I'll have to play it again.

Simply put; the game play two fold; draw cards to try to make sets in your hand, and then play those sets to lay down train lines between cities on the map.

Points are scored by simply laying traintracks and by completing routes which are on separate cards that you draw.

Pretty light-weight 'train themed' game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't play this game to block, so the implementation of the stations doesn't really affect my way of playing.  For me, the real addition is in the tunnels, which adds enough chaos to make you plan ahead for your routes.  I do see some improvements with the game, through the shorter ticket routes and the more crowded nature of the board.

1 play: 3 players
2 plays: 4 players
7 plays: 5 players
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very good game for the entry level gamers. You have to create different routes on a map using trains by collecting several different coloured cards. With more than 3 players interaction exists because there are difficulties to go where you are supposed to. Don't try it with less, it's not worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
More interesting gameplay than TtR due to extra rules and different map.  Fun game, but prefer playing it online at www.daysofwonder.com, as the fiddly bits can be tiresome -- managing all the train pieces, not bumping the scoring markers, remembering to score -- and online the software marks your ticket cities on your map so you can easily keep track of them.

I think it plays almost exactly like the first one. It's fun having a new map. The tunnels and ferries don't appreciably change things.

Bottom line is both games are easy to learn, fun to play, and well worth owning.

Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe  features brand new gameplay elements including Tunnels, Ferries and Train Stations. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.
\13\\13\
Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.

Ticket to Ride Synopse:\13\
With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in 3 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets - goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.

This isn't much different than the original Ticket to Ride.

A game with a colorful map and neat train car game pieces.  My daughter and I now play the game with the full rules whereas we started without tunnel and ferry rules.  We enjoyed it quite a bit initially, but it doesn't get requested as much anymore.  We play a lot more of [thing=22398]10 Days in Asia[/thing] by the same game designer than this game.

I like most of the changes (still not sure the stations are costed correctly). Definitely enjoy the tunnels and the ferries, and the routes seem better. More pressure to play rather than hoard cards, which is an improvement.

So, a fine game, but...I really wish this had been released as an expansion, as I didn't need new trains or new cards (and I'm baffled as to why larger is better in a game where you might hold 20+ cards). No crisis, just space "wasted" on my shelf.

A really simple, quick, rewarding game with just enough tension. The original Ticket to Ride was one of the early "hobby games" that I played; it was good, but I like this one better because the Stations and the long routes make this game a bit less luck-dependent. It's a small thing, but I also like how each of the cities is labeled with its local name. Great as a gateway game, but also sstill rewarding for me to play years on.

With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.

The +: TtR Europe plays differently than the original game and it's more balanced.
The -: IMHO, this could have been published as an add-on, the trains are the same, the smaller cards from TtR could have been used for this game too. They should only have included the board, train stations, destination cards and rules. 
I don't know why they didn't do this. The product would have been cheaper, more people would have bought it, the margin would have been greater...

Now that I've played this more, I've adjusted both my ratings for TtRE and the original.  (As I like Europe better than the original.)

It may have been luck of the destination tickets, but it doesn't look as if the stations come into play in a 2-player game.  In the 4-player games we've seen one staion about half the time.  Though a 3 or 5-player game would probably see more stations, (and be nastier.)

It's like the Risk of train games. You draw cards endlessly and put put trains on the map on tracks that match the color of the cards you make sets of. That's pretty much it. I guess if your route gets blocked you would pretty much automatically lose which seems like a significant hole in the balance of the game. It's a simple diversion and nothing more.

I'm a big fan of the TtR series.  A lot of fun for both gamers and nongamers.  Of the three (USA vs. Europe vs. Marklin), I probably like Europe the least -- but I still really, really like it.  I think the tunnels, ferries, and stations don't grab me as much as the simplicity of the USA version or as much as the fun of planning passenger routes with Marklin.

Still, it's a solid 8 for me, and that's not bad at all.

Elegant. Easy to teach. The game I pull out first when I have non-gamer friends over.

Ticket To Ride is much-neglected by experienced gamers as they tend to move on to games with more interesting and novel mechanics, but I don't think that the simple gameplay of Ticket to Ride should be underappreciated.  It's very simple to teach yet provides a very solid and reliable gaming experience. The Europe map is probably the friendliest, so if you want something with more tension and conflict, then perhaps invest in a map pack.

Ticket to Ride is eigenlijk hetzelfde als het standaardspel, met een paar nieuwe twists.

Zo zijn er tunnelroutes, die mogelijk meer kaarten vereisen, en zeeroutes die gebruik van lokomotieven verplicht stelt. Hiernaast mogen spelers ook stations bouwen die de mogelijkheid geven om routes van andere spelers te gebruiken, maar deze zijn erg beperkt en leveren extra punten op als ze ongebruikt zijn.

Europa is denk ik net iets leuker.

After a day spent with TTR:E I conclude: the replayability is great and the rules are extremely easy. It can be played with casual gamers as well as pro-gamers and there is no great difference in the ability of scoring points. The tunnels make the game even more exciting and add to the tension.We seldomly used the Stations, but almost anyone tries to get the bonus points for the longest railroad. What's a litte sad is, that there is very few long tickets as well as only two long lines one can build, both of which are either a tunnel or a ferry. This does not diminish the fun, thgugh and it is only notable, if one knows Marklin Edition or the original one.And it really needs only about an hour to play, which is really great.Finally, the downtime is extremely low, even with 4 players.

Positives: Simple to learn. THE modern gateway game. You can play with gamers or grannies. Satisfying and has enough depth to entertain most

Negatives: Once you are into the hobby, you will probably find this too light and want to play almost anything else given a chance  


Conclusion: Probably the most vanilla modern board game there is. It will not upset, it will not excite, but it will allow you to play a board game with friends/family who might otherwise never play a board game

A modern classic. Develops the original Ticket to Ride idea into something more balanced, with more variety and in a location more familiar to people I play with. Good as a family game or as lighter fare for gamers to wind-down with.
Stations reduce the chance of getting completely blocked, making this suitable for friendly games with relatives. However, it is still possible to play some cut-throat moves, so it's not all fluffy and nice.
The introduction of ferries and tunnels gives added value to locomotive cards. 
Splitting the tickets into short and long routes works well, although some of the tickets are noticeably weaker than others (Edinburgh-Athens springs to mind).

RATING: 8.75
Having played TTR: US, India, Switzerland, and Africa, it seemed that the next best step was Europe. I traded Flash Point: Fire Rescue for it, and despite the cost difference from what I provided (with expansions) for Europe, I'm still very happy with the trade.

Europe is generally rated/reviewed higher than US, and for good reason. Europe adds just a couple of new twists that aren't overly complex, but still make you think through how you want to proceed. If you have just one TTR game, make it Europe. 

(I do not yet own the 1912 expansion, but hope to sometime in the future.)

I like it, have played it many times but on balance prefer TTR US, as there is more flexibility in building long routes, and I find the route cards better balanced.

Outstanding game.  As with classic Ticket to Ride its approachable enough for anyone to play, but deep enough to be continuously engaging and interesting.  Holds true to the Ticket to Ride formula while adding just enough with the Europe map and stations mechanic to keep things fresh. Solid components and excellent box design are a standard for the series and the full sized cards are a welcome upgrade.

I like this more than regular TtR, and possibly more than Marklin though I only played that once. I think the Stations, Ferries Tunnels ADD strategy, not take it away, in spite of the small additional portion of luck. It makes you have to weigh how badly you want something in order to get it. I like that. :)

Nicely themed, light game for families, but could be also nasty with pro gamers. Strategy can be hard at times. When you collect train cards, others occupy your routes, if you try building, when you have not enough cards. And then there is a lot of luck drawing additional route cards.

Simple mechanics, and great length. Similar to the table card game "rummy" in many ways and especially in the scoring system.

House Rule: Allow two actions per turn, one draw action (ticket OR train cards) AND one placement action (station OR route). Additionally, you may not play face-up draws immediately.

I enjoy TTR but the Europe map didn't bring enough to the table and left me disappointed.  The stations remove too much tension since blocking is the primary, interactive element in the game.  Ferries and Tunnnels are just... meh, imo.

I enjoy Asia (for team play) and Africa's terrain mechanic so much more :D

Enough different things (map, tunnels, stations, etc) to warrant owning and occasionally playing. Kind of like a large scale variant to the original TTR. Nothing heavy, but still quick and fun.

Ticket to Ride is a very simple "gateway" game. While I found the original Ticket to Ride a little bland for me, I have played Europe in the past and think that it adds a few more things that will make it more enjoyable for the family to play.

Much better than original in that it better utilizes the locomotives, more fairly distributes the route cards and adds a couple elements (stations and tunnels) to spice up the game.

I enjoyed it. Don't really get the hang of it, though... You have to be pretty lucky, too (route cards, drawing of random cards, tunnels)...

EDIT: Having played dozens of time since I wrote the comment above, my opinion towards TtR has changed for the better. I love this game, and I can't see myself ever not liking it. I would never turn down a game. Sure, there can be randomness and frustration, but timing is still an important factor.

I have to say, it was one of the most underwhelming games I've ever played. One play is enough to tell me that I never need to play TtR again. 

Over half the game is spent drawing cards. Further, luck of the draw is an incredibly big factor, masked by several turn options which create the illusion of mitigating luck, while instead simply exacerbating the good fortune of others... You spend turns drawing more cards, trying for more tickets or placing stations or laying track along tunnels and failing, while players who have tickets in close proximity, or drawing the colors they need, or jumping into a railway without the need for a station or who never draw extra cards to sink into tunnel development pull away.

Incredible production value, but one of the least interesting, least strategically compelling games I've ever played.

This takes the brilliance of the *excellent* Ticket To Ride, and further refines it almost to perfection.  Newly added complexities of the stations, ferries and tunnels add even more deep strategy to this game.   If there's one criticism I have it is that it became so instantly popular that I've played this one a bit too much lately... but it's so great that I shouldn't really complain.

A great family board game. Trying to accomplish the rute your cards are telling you to do but we careful other players might need to place their vagons in a route you want to go too.

A suprise gift from Gwen and the girls Christmas 2010! Thanks beautiful ladies!

I've played quite a bit of the original TTR so playing on a new map was pretty enjoyable and I liked how the long and medium tickets are broken up and that the ferries made people more likely to grab locomotives off the display.

However, I enjoy the original a bit more as I found the stations to remove a bit of tension from the game and didn't enjoy the frustration that could be added by the tunnels.  Still, its TTR so you know you're going to have a good time when you play!

RATING: 7.5
A much tighter game than its predecessor.  I enjoy the new mechanics, and there aren't as many throw away routes that plague the USA map (especially in the mid-central area).  I found TTR Europe riskier, more nerve racking, and just overall a more satisfying experience.  Definitely my preferred choice to play.

Update: I knocked 0.5 point off the score because after playing it for a while, I felt that the Europe map also suffered from a lack of synergy in the destination cards.  The game more often than not is also reduced to making the longest route (like in USA); there is almost no point to drawing more tickets since claiming the only 6 and/or 8 length tracks on the board will usually net you a higher score.

RATING: 7
Ferries requiring locomotives is an interesting touch, though since they're around the perimeter, a player may never have to face that challenge in a game.  The stations are a nice compensation for being otherwise cut off from connecting a ticket's destinations, especially with the tradeoff of their being worth 4 points each if you can spare them.  The tunnels, though, are what bring greater suspense to the game.  Making sure you have enough extra cars of that color (or locomotives) you have in your hand before connecting a tunnel, so you don't effectively miss a turn, while trying to minimize time wasted in collecting cards you don't need is a nice element of gambling.

We played this with new gamers. It's a good introduction game. To less interaction for me.

I have played this one a few times now. The game requires a reasonable sense of geography, and hence leaves me at a distinct disadvantage. You are required to build train routes between European cities as outlined on rail tickets distributed at the start of the game. Naturally, you need the correct material to do it, and obstacles such as tunnels and other players form quite a hinderance... Much more fun to play than the quirky descriptions its given might lead you to believe.

Love it, the wife loves it. Fun, top notch components, simple rules.  Would have really loved wooden trains but oh well...

Very good. The game heats up near the end. Once 90% of your trains are down, it's time to start reeling the tickets in.

Played a few games, but everyone is wondering where the competitive element is? Will keep trying though.

The added elements tunnels, ferries and stations bring some more variety and depth to the game but also decrease the simple elegance of the original TtR.

This is a very good expansion that in some ways make the game more competitive. But it's just not as much fun to me. I think that has to do partially with theme (I prefer to think of myself as an American Railroad Tycoon) and partially with the requirement for locomotives.

Possibly the best gateway game, tickets can be a bit too random for my liking though.

Because of the ferries and the tunnels, this is a mild improvement upon the origianl "Ticket to Ride."  Also, new gamers seem to really like this one!

I really dislike when you have to spend 10-15 minutes after a 4-5 player game to count victory points to establish the winner. An - ok - family game, nothing more, nothing less. Misses action and adrenalin rush!

RATING: 8.5
Slightly better than the original because it adds an extra hint of variety.

What keeps it from a higher score: The same 2 or so actions feel repetitive after 75 minutes or so.

Kinda mindless, little interaction between players, but decent intro to gaming.

Fantastic gateway game. Great theme, great components and good luck/skill ratio. 
Highly recommended as a family game.

Build a train empire across Europe to score points and block your opponents. Players collect sets of cards of different colours from a central supply and use them to claim routes on the board. Tickets can give you extra points for connecting certain cities, but leaving them incomplete will lose you points at the end.

Theme: Early 20th century trains
Mechanic: Set collection / route building
Ideal players: 2-5
Length: Medium

One of the best games ever! You can teach the rules in 5 minutes and it's still enjoyable for hundreds of sessions. We have introduced it to unexperienced gamers aged 7 through 70. Everyone of them have enjoyed the game and many have bought their own copy. I think we will play it again tonight!

It's difficult for me to buy light games, so I avoided this one for quite some time.  But, I'm glad I finally bought it, as it offers some good, wholesome, family fun.

Incredibly good game.  It's one that I can play with non gamer friends and gamer friends alike and have a great, nail biting game.  Perfect blend of intuitive game play and strategy, not to mention very nice production value.

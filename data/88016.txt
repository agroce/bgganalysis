Had high hopes from this game but my 4 player experience turned me off. The start game is terribly boring with such a high percentage of useless cards. Game then seems to finish before you've got a good engine going. Also, with only drawing 4 cards per turn, the odds of getting 4 buy cards to buy the most expensive companies is incredibly low.

I fell behind the other players early in my only playing of this game and couldn't catch up because there are fewer items to buy than there are players. The saving grace of this situation is the brevity of time required to complete one game. The game takes about fifteen minutes to set up; that's a long time for such a short game.

An interesting combination of resource management and deck building. Players acquire various companies and they activate them using some resources in order to produce more or different resources and eventually VPs. The actions that you can take on your turn (Buy, activate, etc) are determined by your pesonal deck of cards. As a resource game it is quite simple to find the right strategy but the deck building aspect provides enough randomness that keeps it from being solved. The game has variable setup and the obstacle cards provide some interaction between the players. Great artwork.

A very interesting game!

It offers something novel and refreshing. The combination of Deck-Building and Card-Activation mechanics is awesome.

On the other hand, I expected better abilities on the cards, and more things to do in a round if one happens to draw useless card at once. 

The game has the prospect of becoming a landmark in the deck-building world. Maybe an expansion would help with the fine tuning of all game aspects.

I also like the artwork.

A good work overall!

First Play: Obviously as a deck management game its going to be compared to Dominion. I didn't like Dominion very much but I like this a little more. However as a four player we massively exceeded the 45 minute game time suggested and after rule explaining the game took about 2.5 hours. Just way too long.

I would probably play again but this seems to be typically a game where you identify the various companies that compliment each other and churn. Some minor screwage but more cooperation. Not a game that I will buy so it makes my Essen list easier.

Es un deck builder del estilo de dominion. Se trata de un juego que ha salido adelante a partir de una iniciativa europea similar al kickstarter (no conozco el nombre). Está ambientando en el tema de compra de empresas y producción de bienes. Cuando compras una empresa, al activarla por primera vez, otorga una ventaja de juego que pasa a ser un modificador permanente de las condiciones de juego. También pueden producirse (consumiento recursos) otras cartas de decisión. Hay cuatro tipos de cartas de decisión: obstáculos, compra, alquiler (para usar empresas de otros jugadores) y activación.

Es un juego corto, entretenido y con mucha miga. Totalmente recomendable. Para mi gusto, es mejor que Dominion, aunque es mucho menos conocido.

An interesting take on the deck-building genre, where your starting deck allows you to buy buildings and building materials.  There are also cards allowing you to activate those buildings in order to give you special powers and additional cards in your deck.  So, in the end, you're building a resource management system in order to buy and activate buildings for points.

While the idea is neat, there are a couple shortcomings.  The first is that the starting deck seems really wacky.  Over half the cards in your deck are completely useless out of the gate, so you'll spend several of your first turns simply passing.  Not exactly a way to get people excited about the game from the beginning.

The second thing I didn't really like is that while there are many buildings to choose from per game, you often end up building a good number of them.  And if there's a good combo, it's often obvious to where everyone wants to do the same thing.  So, you don't end up with much differentiation in strategy, whereas other deck-builders seem to accentuate that aspect.

In the end, I feel like Briefcase is a neat idea that didn't spend enough time in development.  If the idea could here could be refined a bit more, I think there'd be a really good game.  As it is, the game is OK and a game I will play very occasionally.

The first several turns of each player's game are quite simply the worst opening moves to any game I've played in a very long time. Your deck is overloaded with blocks (worthless cards that don't let you buy anything), so you often get to make 1 or 2 blocking switches during your first few turns. AND THEY DO NOTHING, because everyone else is stuck doing blocking switches as well.

Briefcase is een deckbuilding game, zoals Dominion of Thunderstone. Concreet wil dit zeggen dat je in de loop van het spel je eigen stapel kaarten gaat proberen uit te breiden en optimaliseren, zodat je aan het eind van de rit telkens de juiste kaarten op handen krijgt om de acties uit te voeren die je wenst uit te voeren. Het thema is in ieder geval een keertje iets anders, als ondernemer ga je aan de slag om je in te kopen bij diverse bedrijven en de voordelen ervan zo optimaal mogelijk te benutten.

Aan het einde van het spel, wanneer er twee stapels grondstofkaarten zijn opgebruikt, of wanneer alle bedrijfskaarten zijn verpatst, wint de speler met de meeste punten. Punten worden verkregen door bedrijfskaarten te bouwen, door bij de bank langs te gaan en letterlijk punten te kopen, door de resterende grondstoffen en enkele bedrijfskaarten generen nog punten afhankelijk van de kaarten die in je stapel zitten.

Je start het spel met in je deck drie soorten kaarten, koopkaarten, activeringskaarten en obstakelkaarten. Deze laatste soort is niet meer dan het woord ook zegt, ze zitten in je weg en je kan ze enkel gebruiken als een bepaald bedrijf het bijvoorbeeld toelaat om 2 (of 3) dezelfde kaarten af te leggen om een actie uit te voeren. Daarnaast kan je ze ook nog gebruiken om een "verboden-kaart" te verleggen. In het spel zijn er telkens twee stapels grondstoffen en twee soorten bedrijven afgesloten voor aankoop, maar met deze actie kan je het vrijspelen.

De spelers starten met vier handkaarten en spelen deze in hun buurt uit zoals ze willen, ze voeren de bijpassende acties uit, leggen de resterende handkaarten af en trekken terug vier handkaarten (tenzij ze reeds een bedrijf aankochten dat hen toelaat om meer handkaarten te hebben). Met de koopkaarten kan je bedrijfskaarten aanschaffen, de kosten worden betaald met een aantal koopkaarten (heb je die niet op hand, pech ...). Voor elke koopkaart kan je ook grondstoffen aanschaffen. Deze heb je nodig om bedrijven te activeren. Want als je bedrijven aankoopt, komen ze gedeactiveerd voor je te liggen. Je mag overigens maar max. 5 grondstoffen bewaren (tenzij je weer een bedrijf hebt dat er meer toelaat).

Dit brengt ons dan ook bij de tweede mogelijke actie, de activeringsactie. Door deze kaart te spelen kan je één van je bedrijven activeren. Je legt de gevraagde grondstoffen af (energie is onuitputtelijk en komt terug in de trekstapel, de rest wordt afgelegd) en ontvangt onmiddellijk het voordeel van het bedrijf en daar bovenop extra kaarten voor in je kaartenstapel. De bedrijven blijven gedurende het ganse spel voor je liggen. Sommige bedrijven leveren een constante eigenschap op, andere dienen geactiveerd te worden telkens je het wil gebruiken. Daarnaast kan je ook de bank activeren. Je legt dan koopkaarten af in ruil voor overwinningspunten. Deze actie kan gedaan worden tot de overwinningspunten op zijn gebruikt.

Tenslotte zitten er ook nog huurkaarten in het spel. Deze worden bekomen door de activatie van sommige bedrijven en stellen je in staat, als je ze uitspeelt uit de hand, om een bedrijf van een tegenspeler te activeren. Je betaalt dan de helft van de kosten in grondstoffen aan de tegenspeler en mag de actie van het bedrijf uitvoeren. De tegenspeler kan dit overigens niet verhinderen.

Al de overige regels hebben eigenlijk betrekken op de bedrijfskaarten en het hangt er dan weer van af welke in het spel zijn. De spelregels schrijven enkele setjes voor waarmee je kan beginnen, of een complex spel spelen, een competitief spel, ...

A nice twist on the deck building genre which takes the different cards and transforms them into building instead. The game can be explained and played quite quickly since the basis are so simple: draw four cards and do what you can with the four cards. The cards in your deck, even as it grows, never change from Buy, Activate, Null and Hire. It is the buildings you can purchase and feed raw materials that change the dynamic of your deck and in there lies the good idea.
Will hit the table again.

Briefcase is a much simpler game compared to Dominion. But instead of having a faster-flowing gameplay, it is a more constrained and laborious game compared to Dominion without any hard decision-making. First, you have the resources layer, which doesn't really seem to matter once you get buildings that convert any resource to a particular type. Second,  there's only so much you can do with the deck-building. You start the game with so many useless cards. There aren't many avenues to trash cards. Blocking, the ability you can use the "useless" cards for, has virtually no effect on the game.

Its not the worst game i have ever played (that was 'Crunch') but it is the most infuriating. You have so many hands of dead, useless cards that it kills the momentum for you all the time. 
Dreadful design choice with that one and one that i would have thought would have been weeded out sooner. the Obstacle cards are just that. They ruin the game.

Unfortunately it wasn't interesting game for me. There's no deck building in fact. I may buy four cards. One is great (buy), one is ok cause I sometime use it (activasion) and two were unplayable in our set of buildings. Also I understand why there is restriction for one building odf a kind per player but choces are so limited because of this. It is not a question what should i buy but only in what order.

A different take on a deck builder. There are only four cards in the whole game which act as a "currency" for actions to do on your turn: "B" (buy) cards let you buy resources/companies, "A" (activate) cards let you activate a company, "H" (hire) cards let you use another person's building for half cost, "O" (obstacle) cards let you move obstacles.

We played the game with the "quickstart" variant in the forums from the designer. I definitely would recommend playing this way (baseline of 5-card hand and everyone starts with 1 unit of energy) because it really speeds up the game in a good way. The original rules as written is a baseline of 4-card hand, which can be a painful drag trying to get 2-3 "B" cards to collide in your hand at the same time.  A 5-card hand dramatically helps this and starting with a unit of energy gives players more flexibility on what companies to activate early on as many things do require a unit of energy. [so you don't HAVE to activate the powerplant first this way].

I thought this brought a few new ideas to the deck-building table, which is a good thing: the mechanism by which you build your deck is indirect, i.e. activating buildings and adding resource management into the mix.  However I found that there were too many turns (10 or more) when I had nothing to do unless I wanted to do something to block someone else; that is a mechanism I don't care for.  Clearly the game is not for me, but for those with a high take-that tolerance or liking, you should give this one a shot.

Good little deck builder. Does give the feel that you are building your own empire of business's, so theme to me is good. With a lot of different cards to pick from, the game will never play the same. Resource management plays a good part of the game which I like! Little bit of gotcha in the game, with blocking cards that are available (which can be changed if you draw the right cards) to others meaning they may not get what they want.

Score could increase with more games!

I like the game, it's a pretty standard Deck-Builder, much in the vain of Dominion but with a little twist that to me makes it better... it has a strong thematic economic flavor and the twist is that you don't simply get money cards like in Dominion or Trains, you have Buy Cards and you use them to Buy the Companies and to Buy the Resources you need to Activate those companies, and this middle step of buying the Resources to me makes the game much cooler than Dominion... the pace is slower for obvious reasons and you have some decision to make on your turn, specially if you are using the City Hall expansion that gives good use to the Obstacle Cards...

I didn't particularly enjoy the Tax Inspector cards, don't see the point for them in the game and will probably never use them again.

To me it's a very Solid game

Clever deck-building game. Better than BGG rating seems: should be top-1000 at least.

Starts slow but gets more speed during play with more "B" and some "H" cards. It's also very tight until the end of the game.

Interesting buildings and combos: some make useful the "O" cards, others improve your deck...

Worst issue: the long setup.

Give it a try.

A deck builder with a resource management element.  

From the few times I've played the game, it seems that the main goal is to buy companies that assist you in cycling through your deck faster, and buying companies that allow you to utilize 'obstacle' cards as other 'decision' cards.  The  Central Bank should be used towards the end of the game to collect additional victory points, because your precious 'buy' cards are forever gone when they are used this way.  

Additional plays will be needed to see how deep this game really is.  Rating could go up. 

Pros: Puts a new twist on deck building games.

Cons: Set-up is fairly long for my taste.

I love the idea this game is based on, and this is why I bought it. It is a deckbuilding economic game where you buy different companies that will enhance/add obstacles to you deck and at the same time, give you points and several skills.

The box illustration is superb, and it was a bit of a letdown when I received it and didn't look that georgoeus. But the company card illustrations are very good too. I was not that happy about the simbology, but I'm not a very intuitive person. My comlain tough is about the resource cards: they are quite similar and undistinguisable from afar. They should have used different colours. It would hurt to get better designs for the decision cards either.

Most of the people compains about the initial deck having many worthless cards and consequently suffering several dead hands. While it's true and it happens more often in the turns, I don't think it is such a game wrecking experience. You just pass and wait for the next turn. At the end of the deck, every player will get to play all his cards once.

There's only one viable strategy during the first half of the game: get plenty of buy cards, and a couple of activation cards. And you never get to experience this typical satisfaction feeling when you get your economic engine going. 

The interaction level is almost non existant. It is indeed a "solitaire multiplayer". You don't pay a lot of attention to what your rivals are doing, except for trying to guess when the endgame condition will occur.

The endgame is a bit dissapointing. Each turn, you might have a different leader, depending on the companies they activate and the points they give; the winner thus might be a bit random. In fact, strategies will be very similar and I have the impression that success depends more on the luck of the draw that on a good strategy.

This is a very personal opinion, but I think that even if the underlaying idea is very good, the game needed much more development.

This smart little deckbuilder scratches an itch in the crazy acceleration of the game, but also the exquisite timing of the 'VP-switch': when do you start sacrificing your precious 'Buy' cards for raw VPs? The theme makes a lot of sense in this backbiting world and the Obstruction cards are implemented surprisingly effectively. A strange confluence of pretty poor Clipart-standard 'decision card' art but lovely, rich and detailed pictures on the buildings cards.

A fiddly setup, and the fact that Indiegogo backers got more cards than me, are minor downsides.

A few of us played this at Essen.  One of our least favourite games.  The artwork is meh, graphic design could have been a lot better, but more importantly, the game itself was, well... just, nothing really.

You just buy lots of buy cards.  You need them to buy new buildings.  But to activate the buildings you need resources, which you get with buy cards...

Didnt like the obstacle cards really, and moving the block on the resources didnt seem to work well.

A game none of us would choose to play again.

This deckbuilder reminded me a little of Eminent Domain, as the cards you added to your deck were generic and didn't have text.  The comparison ends there, though. The cards in your deck only determined how many actions, buys, etc., you got. The real action occurred in the form of factory-type cards (big square cards) of which 10 random piles were made available at the start of the game, which converted resources (little tiny rectangular cards).  So basically, Dominion with eurogame resource management.  It was decent, but not spectacular.

Is it a deck-building game? Certainley yes. Is it a resource management game? A little bit: you need resources but instead of naming them paper, concrete,...they could just put A, B,... on them. It's not that steel is harder to get then concrete or so, or that you need certain buildings to produce certain resources. You just take the cards/resources you need or can take if they or blocked and you can't move the block.

So for me it's a deck-building game. Is it a good one? Yes. Should you buy this if you like/own Dominion and like the deck-building genre? Sure. Should you own this if you own already Dominion, Ascension, Thunderstone and other Core Worlds? Imho, I don't think so. I like it as a game (otherwise I wouldn't rate it a 7), the playing time is good and if someone would ask me to play it, I'll happily do so, but it just doens't feel that refreshing, that new anymore.

Wonderful artwork from Artipia Games, but sadly an overdose of Dominion leads to a low rating for me. It is inevitable that almost every deck building game will be compared to Dominion, and sadly Dominion is better in this aspect than Briefcase. If you love deck builders, Briefcase is a great game with good mechanics and again just such beautiful artwork.

Really glad to finally get this in my collection as I enjoy games that vary in their layouts.

Currently have played two games with the family with very positive responses from all involved.  The artwork is pleasing (especially the box cover).  Cards types are very easy to recognize at a glance.

Game moves along at a nice pace, not taking too long but long enough to get a strategy working.  There are a few facets of the game I can't seem to figure out yet (when to start using the central bank heavily for example, or how to use hiring effectively) but feel I will after a few more games.

Wish I could have gotten some of the initial promos, but look forward to (hopefully) expansions to come.

Update: knocking this one down a little.  After repeated plays it feels a little too "samey" to me.

Review from 10th Dec 2012:

Played 1 game of Briefcase (light deck building / resource management to create economic engine). Turns spent discarding hand, obstacles are annoying, icon art fiddly to understand, and it feels too drawn out. Ultimately, the mechanisms never really click and there wasn't a sense of theme.

My wife and I won this game through Shire Games' Christmas Quiz back in 2013. I wasn't expecting much of the game, as I know it has a very low ranking here on BGG - but after 1 play, with the suggested "first game" setup, we both thought it was rather good. It's in part a deckbuilding game, and you do add cards to your deck throughout, but as far as I can see the more important strategic elements are about which "businesses" (which give you both VPs and special abilities once they have been bought and activated) you go for in a given game. In other words, it's a bit of an engine-building game where you try to find good combos - which is obviously reminiscent of say Dominion, but doesn't rely as much on drawing card combos together in your hand. I'd certainly be happy to play again, but that one game was back in the summer of 2014 (it might have even been before that), and we've not played since and I'm not crying out for another game. The problems of a large collection...

Had some comments, but discovered we played the game incorrectly.  Withdrawing my comments until I have had a chance to play it correctly.

Basically, ended the game when 2/4 core resources were exhausted.  This shortened the game too much perhaps adding to the feeling that it was rushed.  Proper play is to wait when 3/5 resources are exhausted (ie include the imported recources, but not energy.)

RATING: 3
Rating after one two-player game at BGG.CON 2012.

I'm totally OK with the idea of playing around with the deck-building game concept, and this one does that.  Rather than having the whole game tied up in the variable, cyclic nature of the deck, this game only uses deck-building to manage what a player's menu of actions will be on any given turn, with cards for Buy, Action, Hire, and the dreck, Obstacles.  To buy a level 3 building requires play of 3 Buy cards from a four-card hand, for example.

Long story short, however, it's a bad game.  The starting decks are burdened by having 60% of your starting cards be Obstacles.  The building to increase your hand size seems to be absolutely required to have a chance to build the level 4 buildings, and such no-brainer, no-exceptions decisions suck.  The resources are awfully tight, the Obstacles too abusive to be any fun, and the options for thinning garbage out of one's deck too limited.  Furthermore, in the two-player game each player has exactly the same options, i.e. there's no shortage of any particular building.  As a result, the decisions of what one should do are very simple, and the winner will be the one who draws the best cards to get the actions done in the right order the earliest.  Finally, the "blocking" cards are frustrating, unfun, fiddly, and just lengthen the whole, unfortunate process.  Pass on this one.

Yet another deckbuilding game. It is hard to tell what is new in this one, but maybe it is that the cards that are bought have to be acticated to receive their benefits, and the resource management aspect of the game. Not a bad design, but I don't see the opportunity in which I would like to play this before one of the classics, as Dominion or Thunderstone.

For a deck-builder, this sure seems fiddly.  The idea behind the resources mixing with a deck-builder sounds good in theory, but the application seems a little lacking.

You are acquiring buildings, but it seems pretty easy for everyone to do what they have to do.  I can't put my finger on it.  I'd play it again, but playing it allowed me to see that I don't have to own it in my personal collection.

RATING: 8
Simple mechanics, the deck building to create decision cards (actions) in combination with the use of companies with special abilities turns seemingly useless cards into worthwhile actions. Blocking cards enable screwage of your opponents choice of resources and companies. The luck element is greatest very early on in the game but certainly does not lead to a runaway leader. High replayability with different starting mixes of companies ensures different problems to solve each game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once with 4P. Briefcase combines deck-building with well, constructing buildings. Most of the action takes place in using the cards in your hand to buy resources needed for constructing buildings, which in turn give you certain abilities. (This is similar to how buildings in Cuba are constructed and function.)

However, very little deck-building takes place as the only time you get cards into your deck is when you construct buildings. It's even more difficult getting the dross out of your hand, although there are some buildings which allow you to draw more cards or play wild cards. I think the biggest problem in the design is giving the worthless cards the ability to block resources and buildings, which means that when you have a dead hand, you have the ability to annoy your opponents.

As a result, the early game is highly dependent on luck. Dead hands are quite common, and just when you've drawn a hand of cash, you may find that someone else has blocked the resource that you need. An interesting twist for a deck-builder, but somewhat flawed in execution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not quite as deck-builder as something like Dominion (where your deck is everything) and not as center-of-the-table as Ascension. 

Quick to learn & teach, as long as you leave the instruction book out to quickly reference the mostly intuitive symbols (this is a language-independent game). The first few turns had me scratching my head but then it clicked: buy this, activate this, generate this, then buy this, hope to draw this...

All in all, Briefcase is a solid game that should sit well with a group that's been exposed to deck-based games.

RATING: 5
I like the concept of the game where you are getting an engine infrastructure up by way of a deckbuilder (which in turn aids your deck).  But I found the whole thing to be really clunky.  The starting deck felt unnecessarily difficult, and most people have bunk hand after bunk hand with one or two people getting really lucky in the beginning to get a head-start on everyone else.  I don't understand the intention of the design.

Then after things get going and everyone starts actually playing, the blockers just become a nuisance rather than a feature.  Usually, your hand is rife with dead cards that aren't relevant to your strategy so moving a blocker usually isn't a big deal, and if you can't you just buy something else, cause it is likely you will want to build it eventually anyways and the order doesn't really feel all that urgent.

I never felt that any decision was particularly agonizing, rather I just felt like everything was procedural administrative work.

RATING: 3
A Dominion clone with very little that is original. You might say that blocking the purchase of certain cards is about the only new thing here. I don't think Dominion is all that great (but I give it props for being innovative), as it's just cycling through your cards, and Trains is still my favorite in the genre, but this really is nothing special at all. I guess there is the resource aquisition part, but it's still really just buying cards so you can acquire companies or take actions. I still didn't find it all that interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Boring, luck-infested opening moves drag down what could have been a better game, and the hand size removes too much control. The mid and late game builds into a snowball. Whoever lucked out early on is well poised to accumulate the most victory points. The art is great, but the rules and icons are unintuitive, and setup is a pain. There are too many mediocre games in the deck-building genre. The world didn't need another.

Enjoyed this. The resource management / engine building / deck building blend works pretty well. Some of the card icons seemed a bit obscure or small, but maybe this was just our unfamiliarity.

Picked this up at Spiel 2012 (Indigogo backer).  Deckbuilding with a difference - your deck is composed of only 4 different types of cards.  During the game you buy and activate companies to manipulate the ratios of cards in your deck.  Great fun.

How much of a clone is this of Dominion? Almost entirely. There's really nothing of note here that I haven't seen before.

The blocking aspect is supposed to make the game more interactive. In practise, it just makes it more annoying.

It's staggering how many hands you can do nothing with; how did this get through playtesting?

After the inital frustrations, it's just another engine building card game. Where have I seen that before...? Oh, wait... :(

Having temporary and permanent cards you keep outside your deck is a fine idea for a deckbuilding game. However, most of the other things this does are bad. Having three different kinds of card at the start is not a good idea, particularly with a hand size of four (another bad idea in itself). The blocker cards are not a good idea. Having very few cards which let you increase your hand size or prune non-buy cards from your deck is a terrible idea, since that means your path to buying a red company is very constrained. Pass.

I'll be honest right up front - this is a protest rating.

This is one of the most sexist board games I've seen from the modern era.  I've owned the game and I know what the artwork shows, I'm not basing this on just BGG photo uploads.  The images showing men having power vs. women are at least 12 to 1 in favor of men.  Furthermore, multiple images show women doing cliche things like shopping or acting like Vanna White showing off products.  How this game was viewed as acceptable by modern standards is unfathomable. For a game that's supposed to represent the business world it fails completely in depicting reality.

I would love to like this game.  But the artwork is bullshit.  There's no excuse for it!

Bit smaller than I thought. It's really fun but the cards with clients are so small you need to stop and read each, specially their favorties so that detracts time...maybe make this a bit bigger and boom, problem solved.

Not a bad game, a little bit above Fluxx in strategy and not so much dependent on luck, but it still does figure in.  Played two player and it played quickly and with the poaching and blocking rules makes it more of a competitive game.  Play time is fast so it doesn't overstay it's welcome and the art is solid.  It's a keeper for me.

RATING: 5
Cute game, adorable and diverse character art, but offers little challenge or strategy to the design. Gameplay is quick and straightforward to learn, but seems best suited for novice or young players.

Looney Labs takes on set collection in their own whimsical way.  Not as fickle as most other Looney card games.

Forthcoming (hopefully... still)! Sounds like a typical Loony Labs title: bizarre mechanics and a fun theme, looking forward to checking the final rules out.

I really like the idea and concept. However I think there are too many icons, and some of the icons look quite similar. This means each persons turn is spent examining the icons on both their hand, and cards on the table. The two games we played felt very luck driven, rather than any sort of strategy.

As with most Looney games, fun little game. Well done, great graphics, and great deconstruction of deserts.

The game is really straightforward to the point where there isn't much strategy or tactics at all unlike some other good filler games. Simply matching symbols on cards isn't very compelling. Neat art.

It was okay -- but a good gateway for kids maybe.  Collect cards (partly or mostly luck?) to serve requested menus.  Reminded us of a simpler version of Raid The Pantry.  Good art and colors.

A very satisfying game from Looney Labs, somewhat Rummy-esque but with a dash bit more complexity due to the compound card suits (i.e. ingredients). This is a big hit with my kids, so it's a hit with me too.

Have the real version now. I only played it 2p, but don't recommend it that highly. Maybe with 3 or more... and maybe with some of the optional rules.

I've played Beta 2.  As of Origins 2008, Andy Looney is working on Beta 5.  Andy seems to think that he's finally starting to get the game to where he wants it.  But this game has been in development for years and years.  I'll be surprised if it's ever actually published.  Some "beta" cards were made available on the Looney Labs web site, but the rules have changed several times since then, so you have to mark up your deck if you want to play by the current rules.  Update: Published version!

Looney Labs has created a fun card game here, I like "serving the guests" and trying to collect the sets or getting tips for serving favorites.  Kudos to them for also putting unique art on every single card.  You'll get hungry for S'mores or Ice Cream or whatever desserts cross your path as you play this game.  This is probably my favorite Looney Labs game.

This game is good for a nice quick 15 minute filler, but I would lose interest if gameplay went past 20.  I gave it away to a friend who appreciated the game more than I did.

RATING: 6
Quick, easy to teach, easy to learn, and overall Fun!  You must satisfy guests by fulfilling their dessert wishes, without giving them anything they dislike.  Sounds easy, but when you add in having to get enough of 1 color, or one of each color, it becomes a bit more difficult to win.

It's not a hard game, Kids love it, and it's fun for all ages.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
What an interminably boring game. It's just a game of random card draws. If you manage to match one of the guest cards, great! if not, well draw another card.

Even at 15 minutes this game outstays it's welcome.

Pretty cool game.  Appropriate art, fairly simple ruleset, and a fun time that scales well to five players (which is reasonably rare for a card game).  Not the most novel game idea, but the theme is cute, and it plays quickly.  If you can get it for ten bucks or less, I probably wouldn't hesitate, if your group likes a set collection game with a bit of luck, and some silly characters.  Far above average, but likely not the next Love Letters.

Overall a small, wonky game, that is supposed to be rescued by its theme, which is running a dessert restaurant and you're satisfying customers (which is rife for the most boring double entendre).

This quick little card game is packed full of fun and plays well with any number of players.  You are a waiter serving dessert to guests, but the customers can be very picky.  Customers want various desserts containing peanuts, chocolate, veggies, cookies, cake, pie, spices, apples, etc.  Be careful though, some of them have specific allergies making it difficult to serve them.  The first player to score 5 customers of a different suit or 3 customers of the same suit wins the game.

I just won this in my FLGS's free Tabletop Day raffle.  My wife really enjoyed playing last night, including five games in a row.  It's a fun, fast, and light set collecting game with awesome artwork.  If my wife likes it and is willing to play, that means I like it (as she doesn't like my style of games and rarely plays with me).

Tried an early version at a con in 2005.

After visiting the publisher's web site: I'm dumbfounded that a company would intentionally sell a beta version of a game to the general public.  Since when does it make sense for a playtester to pay for the "privilege" of testing?

Well - if you're going to sell it, I'm going to rate it.

RATING: 8
We love this game. It's so simple, yet challenging, and you just don't know if you should use a dessert for a component, or hang onto it and hope it works out better for another guest. If you make it all the way through the deck, you'll kick yourself for discarding/using cards that are great for guests who had been discarded but have suddenly now returned.

Still haven't played with the advanced rules, with poaching and surprise buffets, but I'm sure we will.

However, one of the Dessert cards, and a Favourite, no less, came with this hideous white void in the middle of it. I don't know if it's a printing error, or if there was a sticker on the card before it was packaged, but it came out of the box with this scar, and I am really annoyed with it.

UPDATE: Alison from Looney Labs was more than happy to replace my defective card, as well as the Granny who had a typo I wasn't even aware of. They came with a nice, thoughtful note, and I was very impressed.

First play went completely over my head. Need a second play to really get a feel for it. But it does feel more chance/luck-driven than the Gallerist, and not in a good way.

RATING: 10
I'm rating this a 10 to objectively reflect the quality of the game:  the rich and well integrated theme, the top notch components, the beautiful artwork, the comprehensive player aids, the simplicity of the just-play-one-card on your turn game play and the very clever interaction between all the game mechanisms.  It's a fantastic creation.

Subjectively, from the point of view of my experience playing a friend's copy with 4 players, it'd have to be a 6.  There is so much to get your head round it's initially very difficult to know what you should do.  We've played around 300 board games in the last 5 years and this was the first for which my wife said she would have quit the game if the surviving three could have continued without her.

Another player became hugely frustrated at his inability to Visit a Noble in order to access the main three game actions because he had insufficient "influence".  It went like this:

How do you get more influence?  By building a ship.
How do you build a ship? By giving up some goods to perform a trade.
How do you get some goods?  By producing from your stores.
How do I build a store?  By visiting a Noble.

There are cards to help break the cycle, but if you don't have them it can feel tiresome being stuck in a rut.

The two hour estimate for 4 players was optimistic.  We were 90 mins setting up and going through the rules.  The game lasted about 3.5 hours and involved a lot of rule checking in response to "How do I...?" and "What does this icon mean?".

Is it worth more than £100?  Maybe, for the right group.  Not for us though.

Beautiful game. Like in every Vital's game, theme and mechanics are very intricately intertwined. Only one thing on the negative side, again, like in most Vital's games - fluidity. Downtime can be heavy, AP moments are not uncommon. All in all, time flies when you play Lisboa and when you are finished, you want to play one more game. But it's midnight already.

เกมยูโรระดับหนักที่ธีมเกี่ยวกับการสร้างเมืองชื่อเดียวกับเกมที่ถูกภัยพิบัติครั้งใหญ่ถล่มจนเมืองเสียหายอย่างหนักในปี 1755 ผลงานจาก Vital Lacerda นักออกแบบเดียวกับ Vinhos , Co2 , Kanban , The Gallerist

ตัวเกมเล่นได้หลายสาย แต่เพื่อความกระชับผมขอรวบไปอธิบายว่าเป้าหมายหลักของเราคือการสร้างร้านรวงและสิ่งก่อสร้างในแผนที่กลางล่ะกัน ด้วยธีมที่ว่าเกมนี้เป็นการฟื้นฟูเมืองหลังเกิดภัยพิบัติ (สมัยนั้นโดนอย่างหนัก ครบทุกแบบ แผ่นดินไหว / ไฟไหม้ / สึนามิ ) ตรงส่วนบอร์ดกลางจะมีที่เอาไว้วางร้านค้าโดยจะสุ่มเม็ดภัยพิบัติสามสีไว้รอบตารางสองมิติ ทุกครั้งที่เราสร้างร้านเราจะได้หยิบเม็ดภัยพิบัตินี้ออกหนึ่งอัน พร้อมกับต้องจ่ายเงินตามเม็ดภัยพิบัติที่ยังเหลืออยู่ (ในเชิงธีมคือสร้างก่อนต้องจ่ายเยอะเพื่อปรับสภาพพื้นที่ สร้างทีหลังก็จะจ่ายถูกลงเพราะมีคนเคลียร์ให้ก่อนแล้ว) แต้มจะมาทั้งจากการหาทางวางตัวคูณแต้มในแบบที่เหมาะกับตำแหน่งสิ่งก่อสร้างของเรา แล้วก็การหยิบการ์ดเงื่อนไขแต้มตอนจบเกมมาเก็บไว้ ไอเดียที่ผมแอบต้องใช้เวลาในการทำความเข้าใจเชิงธีมประมาณนึงคือแต้มและโบนัสเกมจะมาจากการเก็บเซ็ทเม็ดภัยพิบัติให้ครบสามสี ที่ยิ่งได้เยอะเซ็ทก็จะให้ผลประโยชน์กับเราเพิ่มขึ้น

ในแต่ล่ะตาผู้เล่นจะผลัดกันเล่นการ์ดหนึ่งใบเพื่อทำแอ๊คชั่นในแต่ล่ะหมวดไปเรื่อยๆ (ตัวการ์ดมี 4 หมวด โดย 3 หมวดจะเป็นคนในประวัติศาสตร์ที่เป็น กษัตริย์/รัฐมนตรี/ช่าง) การ์ดแต่ล่ะใบสามารถใช้ได้หลายแบบ เราจะเอามาเสียบไว้บนบอร์ดเราเพื่อทำเอาโบนัสประจำการ์ด หรือจะเล่นเพื่อทำแอ๊คชั่นประจำชนิดการ์ดก็ได้ (พื้นที่เสียบการ์ดมีจำกัด และการ์ดที่เสียบไว้จะให้โบนัสบางอย่างกับเรา) พอเล่นตาเราเสร็จเราจะได้เลือกจั่วการ์ดโดยเราจะเลือกได้ว่าอยากจะได้การ์ดหมวดไหนเข้ามือ ระบบที่ผมคิดว่าทำออกมาดีคือระบบ 'เล่นนอกตาตัวเอง' ที่เกมจะให้เราเก็บไทล์พิเศษเอาไว้ ถ้ามีผู้เล่นทำแอ๊คชั่นเล่นการ์ดในชนิดนั้นๆถ้าเรามีไทล์ที่ว่าก็จะสามารถขอเลียนแบบแอ๊คชั่นนั้นได้ด้วย

จุด Love it or Hate it คือระบบเกมที่ค่อนข้างซับซ้อน (.....มากเกินจำเป็น....) ทุกสิ่งอย่างในเกมต้องมีคำถามย้อนกลับไปอย่างน้อยสองขั้น ทั้งๆที่ตัวไอเดียของเกมมันไม่ได้ซับซ้อนอะไรขนาดนั้น ผมทำแอ๊คชั่นเดียวกันสามตาติดยังต้องคอยเปิด player aid อยู่เลย พอเริ่มคุ้นแล้วก็ต้องมาคิดว่าทำไมมันต้องทำให้ยุ่งยากจังว่ะ ตัวเกมมี interlock สูงมาก ทุกอย่างที่จะทำมันเกี่ยวโยงกันแน่นจนนึกไม่ออกว่าจริงๆแล้วต้องทำอะไรกันแน่ อย่างเช่น อยากสร้างร้านต้องมีเงิน -> ต้องขายของหาเงิน -> แต่จะได้เงินต้องมีเรือ -> ต้องสร้างเรือ -> เรือต้องใช้ของในการสร้าง -> ของต้องมาจากร้าน..... อ้าววนลูปแล้วนิหว่า แล้วตกลงจะต้องให้เริ่มตรงไหนล่ะ คือผมเชื่อว่ามีหลายคนสนุกแนวคิดหากำไรกับหาท่าการเล่นจากลูปแบบนี้ แล้วก็ตัวเกมก็มีการหาทรัพยากรในแบบอื่นที่ไม่ต้องทำตามที่ผมยกตัวอย่างมา แต่ส่วนตัวแล้วผมไม่ชอบเกมแบบนี้เอาเสียเลย ชอบเกมที่มันแอ๊คชั่นมันแยกออกกันชัดเจนกว่านี้มากกว่า (ซึ้งก็ไม่ใช่ข้อเสียของเกมนี้นะ แค่ออกแบบคนล่ะแบบ) ในรูปแบบเกม interlock ที่เยอะแบบนี้ ผมคิดว่า Madeira ดีกว่าเยอะมาก เพราะฟังก์ชั่นและความต้องการของสิ่งต่างๆมันมีบทบาทที่ชัดเจน
-----------------------------------------
???? [กบชูนิ้วกลาง] -- เพื่อความเข้าใจตรงกันผมไม่คิดว่าเกมนี้เป็นเกมที่แย่นะ แถมโดยส่วนตัวแล้วผมไม่ค่อยถูกกับเกมของนักออกแบบคนนี้ซักเกม (เว้น The Gallerist ไว้เกมนีง) เหตุผลหลักคือเกมของนายคนนี้มักจะ 'ถูกทำให้ยุ่งยากซับซ้อนเพียงเพื่ออยากให้มันยุ่งยากซับซ้อน' ซึ่งไม่ค่อยถูกจริตผมเท่าไร ถ้าให้เรียงลำดับเกมของนักออกแบบคนนี้ล่ะก็ เกมนี้อยู่อันดับหนึ่งของตารางแห่งความไม่ชอบที่ว่าของผมไปเรียบร้อย....... แต่ผมคิดว่าถ้าคุณชอบเกมอื่นๆของนายคนนี้อย่าง Vinhos , Co2 , Kanban คุณก็น่าจะชอบเกมนี้นะเพราะ 'ลายเซ็น' เค้ามาครบ

RATING: 10
Technically I've played this 3 times and I'm really looking forward to more. It's great to be able to wrap your head around what you need to do to make the most of your next couple turns but for me this has taken a few plays. There's a lot more interactivity, though, so it's hard to plan too much because other players may spoil those plans without even intending to. Everyone was following a noble visit of and I was the third person to be able to follow and I could only think to my self, "please don't build a tool shop, pleases don't build a tool shop!"  I was lucky and sure enough, got that tool shop and was able to score it 3 times for 5 points each. 

Now, everyone I was playing was new, so I was pretty much able to do what I wanted. The downside to the amount of player activity is that you can't really plan too far ahead, especially if there are more experienced players, because they'll most likely take that tile you've been eyeing the past turn or so.

Overall, great game that brings new ideas to the table. It's a nice change of pace having more interactivity in a Lacerda game, which make this game really stand out when compared to his other games.

On first play - absolutely loved it. Exciting, thematic, complex strategy. Unfortunately, I just don't have the gaming group for it, and it'd be too sad to have it on my shelf without it ever getting played. Total play time, including rules explanation, was a little under 4 hours, which felt reasonable to be given the depth of the game.

RATING: 6
1 play / 3 players

LIKE: Good connection of decisions and choices, set upon a beautiful board. I liked building and deciding how to manipulate the costs from the rubble available. I liked how the location that you choose to build in could effect current and future scoring, which created some interesting tension between players. To me, this aspect should have been accentuated more in the game design.

DISLIKE: One of the worst things was the small numbers on the powerful clergy tiles. The iconography was terrible, and yet the numbers could barely be seen to look up what each tile did. Some parts of the game felt tacked on and somewhat useless. The treasury track may have modifies action costs, but it was largely ignorable, as was the influence track (easily circumvented by unlocking the money for influence skill). Aside from the building grid, I felt little player tension.

OVERALL: Some specific parts of the game really shone for me, such as the building grid and manipulation of the goods market (it's a euro!). Unfortunately, the whole sum of the game felt mediocre with its extraneous elements, creating a bit of a fiddly and messy experience. I think BGG overrates this game significantly because of the artwork, but it's not a bad game by any means.

Comparable to Zhanguo in gameplay feel, play a card, get some bonuses after building, but Zhanguo feels more streamlined.

RATING: 4
I'm amazed this game has so many high ratings here.  My one play was a fairly painful experience.  It seems that this game has the depth of a typical medium-heavy Euro with twice the rules and 10x the iconography.  This game felt like a Feld on steroids...which isn't a good thing.

I mean, the 8 page "player aid" alone should be warning enough...but hey, I love Through the Ages, Terra Mystica and several other complex games, so I thought...how bad can it be?  Three and a half hours later I was praying for the game to end and I stopped bothering to look up what the end game bonus cards do even though they were pretty essential to my strategy (there are 8 out at any given time).  We spent so much time looking in the rulebook/looking at the player aid that it drained any potential fun from the game...and two of the four players had played it before!

Has a lot of thing to do but mainly building stores is best way to do scoring, cannot ignore this part. 

Taking decree card is also very important which that would lead your strategy throughout the game. The earlier you take, the higher chance you can get clearer picture of doing what you wanted to do.

Still cannot grasp any dominant strategy after 2 play. Would like to try again to see what else I can do.

An excellent game from Vital Lacerda!

This one is dense.  Denser than dense.  Denser than bunt cake dense.  It's not even all that confusing (there are really only 9 base actions and 2-3 ancillary/triggered ones) and the engine is there and can be grokked, but the ways, OH THE WAYS!, that you [i]trigger[/i] these actions are varied and tricky.  (TRICKY, I SAY!)

I learned the rules by reading the rulebook, playing out my own 2p game solo, then reading & watching videos to see what I did wrong.  My biggest and KEY insight was that only the middle of the card matters when playing it to the central board and only the top & bottom matter when playing it to your personal board.  Why this wasn't clearly expressed in the rulebook I will never know.  That alone clarified a lot for me.

I like the engine.  You need réis (money) to build stores.  You need influence to visit nobles and do things like open public buildings (which help you/everyone score for stores).  But you need plans for the public buildings.  And you need goods to get money and ships.  Ships help you sell goods for money.  But you also need goods to trade with the nobles.  And on and on it goes.  Add to this the different ways you trigger these actions, and the different bonuses available, and it gets crazy.  CRAZY!  Crazy [i]fun[/i] and head-hurting, of course.  But CRAZY!

So yeah, I love this one.  The options are ridiculous,  The different paths are varied and multitudinous.  The choices are plentiful and meaningful.  Truly a gem!

And the only reason I rate this a 9 instead of a 10 is the complexity (and associated barrier to entry/learning time) and game length (on the high side for what it does).  But it is lots of fun!

Simplesmente uma obra complexa e que funciona melhor que o jogo anterior do autor. Lisboa tem menos mecanismos interligados, mas as ações transcorrem de maneira mais natural desta vez. Uma arte soberba e produção altissima. Ótio tema, partida que se desenvolve bem e sem caminhos óbvios para a vitória como The Gallerist. Gostei bastante.

smooth play and quick turns. 1 hour/player. Play one card, make your action(s) - one or two - and next player: great !

Ok, may be you'll be out of influence or goods or reals... you'll do better a next day ! a masterpiece for me: you can evaluate precisely the goals of your opponents and react to their strategy if they threaten your positions 

Play this game now !

[i]2017/10/04 - 2 plays 1-2p[/i]

Wonderful game. The production values are through the roof, and gameplay is very fluid. Once the rules are understood, the game actually plays quite fast, making the game very approachable.

The theme permeates every facet of the game design, from the rules to the graphic design, and helps a lot in understanding the game. I particularly enjoyed the flavor text, which is a nice and unobtrusive entry point to the historical period.

The game itself is a delight. You start with very tight resources, but game end is completely different with an economic acceleration. Managing the end-game is crucial for victory. The struggle for control of the shop location and public buildings is an interesting chess-like aspect of the game, while the action selection via hand management and action follow-up is key to stay in the race. I still haven't figured out what is the true importance of the Church track, but it seems go affect the play tempo.

Thematically the decrees (end game scoring goals) are the weakest part, but they are necessary to the game.

I have read some criticism about randomness, but I think you need to understand that the game is quite tactical, even though you need to have some strategic awareness.

The solo version is a pleasant surprise, and reinforces the spatial chess like aspect of shop building and public building aspect of the game. Although I played solo to help learning the game, I think it's actually an interesting way of playing Lisboa.

Another fantastic Lacerda game. Takes a long time to set up, but it is worth it, because the game has a lot of depth. Love it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A large, sprawling complex euro with typical Lacerda touches including: deeply interlocking mechanics, multiple "currencies" used to accomplish many different actions, and a myriad of small, one time benefits that are, in part, randomly distributed around the board at the beginning of each game.

Distinctively, Lisboa is driven by multiple use cards (which felt new in a Lacerda game) and certainly suggests considerable replayability.  Are certain cards overpowered?  Hard to say definitively after only one play.

Lisboa also utilizes a version of Lacerda's "out of turn order action" mechanic found In his previous game, The Gallerist, wherein, under certain circumstances, on a player's turn, an opponent may also take a slightly lesser version of the action as well, out of turn.  This noticeably disrupts the flow of the game (whose turn is it again?) and feels inelegant, but for fans of complex euros it does create a distinctive layer of  action evaluation and interaction. 

I greatly enjoyed the theme, the use of three cube colors to signify the different types of damage to the devastated city, the distinction between public and private buildings, and the three historic figures involved in rebuilding the city.

On the negative side...the game board is beastly large, which granted, for some, might be a major selling point:  look at ALL this game I purchased!  For me, the board, and the player boards, felt bloated, inelegant and overproduced.  

The art design is assuredly distinctive, historically rooted, and given license to sprawl across all surfaces.  However, is the art conducive to a positive feeling while immersed within it, or for that matter, following immersion within it?  For me, for better or worse, the answer is - no.  

Regarding the feelings elicited by the art, granted, the theme here is the rebuilding of Lisboa after a calamitous earthquake, resulting in the tragic deaths of tens of thousands of people, on a spiritually significant day, All Saints Day.  This tragedy changed the course of history in Europe and the world.

As such, should "playing a game" that simulates the aftermath of this tragedy "feel" positive?  How one answers that question, I would say, depends upon a person's disposition about how to "respond" to the darker chapters of human history.  For me, the art in Lisboa felt unnecessarily drab, neutral or negative, creating an atmosphere, a place, that I simply did not want to regularly inhabit.

Like most of Lacerda's games, Lisboa is quite a challenge to teach and fiddly, so fiddly the player aide is essentially a novella, something that I personally can tolerate as a complex euro gamer.  On the other hand, medium weight and family euro gamers, well, good luck with Lisboa!

Lastly, LIsboa is clearly a VERY open ended game design, unusually so.  Some refer to this as a "sandbox" design.  Consider that when it is time to take your turn, you are holding five cards, very likely to be comprised of at least a king card, a builder card, and a marquis card, then perhaps a treasury card, and let's say, another king card.  In accordance with the rules, each one of these cards can be used in two ways.  As such, the player is initially presented with 10 choices to ponder.  

Once you have chosen in your mind one of these 10 choices, in accordance with the rules, you then typically face a binary decision.  On the one hand, I could choose to sell goods (assuming ships are available).  On the other hand, I could take any "one" or "two" of six possible actions (assuming you have the resources to pay for the actions) representing 21 additional choices, not to mention the order in which the "two" actions are performed, so perhaps, actually 42 choices. Each one of these 42 choices then leads to anywhere from 2 to 20 more additional choices. 

It seems to me that the plethora of choices (on the order of 100 possible choices for each player on their turn) in LIsboa underscores a very distinctive game design (quite distinct, as a matter of degree, from Kanban for example).  

Some gamers are going to find this distinctly vast number of decisions in Lisboa overwhelming, or simply put, NOT fun to think about.  (Others are going to love it.)  And for gamers prone to AP, or trying to win at all (time) costs, this distinctively vast number of choices to ponder "before leaping" is going to produce LONG turns.  Chess, by comparison, feels far more tractable, with far fewer options to ponder on a turn!  Such an open ended design did not feel elegant to play, not that "elegance" is the sine non qua of any work of art.  Yet, if one could create a feeling of elegance, in addition to your other game design goals, why not have it in your game design?

I emerged from playing Lisboa with a curious feeling:  that there were many permutations of the Lisboa game design considered in prototypes, and that the permutation used as the final, published game design was NOT the best permutation.  

Surely there was a permutation that had a bit more elegance, and a bit more "inherently fun for all human beings to play with this" in it!  I felt like there WAS a more streamlined version of Lisboa that could have shipped in the Lisboa box, like the "33 choices per turn" version.  That would be the version I would want to play.  Or perhaps there was a "200 choices per turn" version of Lisboa, and the final, published "100 choices per turn" Lisboa IS the streamlined version!  Interesting.

Maiden play.
3P game.
Final score 11x to 10x to 9x.

This game surpassed all of my high expectations for this game.
Sublime game design for the player whose bias leans toward enjoying wide open sandbox-style games. The openness of the game design reminds me Great Western Trail, but doubles down on all of the different routes to victory one can explore. Moreover, each moment demanding a decision is packed full of a multitude of choices and trade offs. (i.e. 1) which political card to use (1 of 5 choices); 2) choosing where to play the political card (player board or noble court); 3) which state actions to choose if trading with the nobles (1 of 6 choices (assuming you have all the resources at your disposal); the permutations go on and on.

The theme is wonderful. Vital's passion for Lisbon and its history permeates every detail in this game.

Lisboa was a joy to play.

Thank you, Vital, for your passion for sharing your home and game design with the rest of the gaming community.

This game has lots of moving parts and all of them come together in an interesting way.  Lots of interaction and lots of fun.  Board a bit busy and not quite sure if the game justifies the rules overhead but this is an excellent mid weight euro.  I like how cards can be used in 2-3 different ways ( top of player board, bottom of player board or in the middle).

2 player game, me and Brian. I pulled it out 121-87. We took about an hour to go over rules together. This game really reminds me of a Splotter game but with 1000% better components. It is complex with a ton of moving pieces, but runs so smoothly. Everything makes sense from a thematic as well as a mechanism standpoint. So, influence the architect to build or the king to get Decree (VP) cards? Makes sense. I love how the actions all feel quite different as well. The board (which is BEAUTIFUL!!!!) has what amounts to almost minigames on it depending on the action taken. Move the Cardinal here on this rondel to get tiles or score your Influence. Add buildings here to get good depending on how they face. Take plans here to build a special building but only if its the right color. I know this sounds rather complex, but it really isn't. This will go right into my Top 100 and stay there for a long time.

This will probably be the next game I teach to Flo as she really enjoys heavier economic games. 

So, for my list of favorite boards of all time:

1. Pillars of the Earth
2. Fallen City of Karez
3. Lisboa
4. Legends of Andor

High praise indeed.

The actual gameplay is not that complicated. What's complicated is the depth of decision making, and the fact that each action has implications and requirements for other actions.

I think this game is incredible. Teaching is not easy, but I'd say about halfway through the first game a regular person should have a grip on how to play (assuming it was explained well by someone who knows how to play.)

Also, the game has the highest production value I've seen — both in terms of component quality and art/design/iconography quality.

I tried to like it, but unfortunately it's too random compared to Laderda's other games. The game is too complex overall to be so unbelievably random - the availability of the action cards and moreover the goal cards popping up make it very unpredictable :-/
Otherwise the game is so beautiful!

RATING: 9
This is a beautiful production and a really compelling game. Like most Vital Lacerda games, it appears quite overwhelming at first. However once you see how the mechanics work it actually flows very smoothly and has a nice tightness to actions. Players need to balance multiple objectives, try to execute things in an optimal order, prevent their opponents from following, maintain good access to goods and money, position themselves well for mid and end game scoring, collect their own personal end game scoring cards, and try to upgrade their personal tableaus. There is a lot to process and thing about in this crunchy strategy game. The artwork and design really are wonderful to experience. To date I have played several Vital games (CO2, Vinhos, The Gallerist, Kanban, and Lisboa). My personal favorite was Vinhos for the tighter and more focused gameplay. I think Lisboa is right along these lines and feels in many ways like several of the ideas from his previous games have been implemented very well in a combined package. Highly recommended!

A little overcomplicated with tons of ambiguous icons everywhere. After some time you get used to it, but still it doesn't give a feel of smooth play or a sense of accomplishment when you build something. You need to follow opportunities rather than own long-term strategy, which is actually not a bad thing as such, but just another thing that adds some weight to already heavy game.

Heavy.

Brilliant stuff. The rules teach was tricky due to the way everything interlocks, but not hard to remember once taught. Gives you a great sense of progress, with lots of big moves that feel rewarding. Excellent scaling, with lots of avenues for interacting with your opponent; multiplayer solitaire this is not.

While still finicky with procedural rules, there was at least some effort to not over design and bog down the game. A streamlined Lacerda sounds like an oxymoron, and while that has not been achieved, Lisboa borders on that effort. There are still lots of little rules that don't do much. Eg. the cardinal that gives you small little bonuses (but a few seem much overpowered broken). The order in which you build your houses gives you small little bonuses. The economy adjusts prices for no apparent reason. The list goes on. 
I still REALLY dislike the play-out-of-turn-order mechanic, but here it is not as egregious as in The Gallerist.

The graphics are pretty, but busy; and not always intuitive.

RATING: 3
I'm a big fan of Kanban and Gallerist but this one seemed to be complex for the sake of complexity. The iconography certainly does not help either. Sadly this will be the only Vital game I do not own.

I played it at BGG.CON with my wife and 2 other Heavy Euro / 18xx players. Me and the 2 other players were learning while playing. My wife had read the rules the night before. Paul Grogan was the one demoing the game for us. The 3 of us (excluding my wife) all had pretty much the same feeling, the experience was overwhelming and we were unable to perform the basic actions without constantly asking Paul for steps on the rules. I'm sure now after I've thought about it that this experience was largely due to bad explanation.

Paul decided not to give an overview of all the actions in the game and decided he would just teach us as we went along. So we would sort of say, ok, I want to play this card without really knowing what it did, and then he would walk us step by step to do the action.

After reading the rules, it was not nearly as complicated as our first play, but it is still not very intuitive. 

One of the main contributing factors is that the multi-use cards are each used slightly differently. In Kanban, each action is very discrete, so it's a lot easier for me to understand what each one does, as well as remember each step. For example, I go here to get plans. I go here to get parts, etc etc.

But with Lisboa, you can play cards into your portfolio 2 ways, then you can sell goods or trade with the nobles. If you trade with the nobles, you can then do 6 different state actions. Or you can play cards into the Royal Court, which allows you to do a noble action and a state action. But if you have a Favor, you can do a nobel action or a state action. My group found it difficult to remember which combination / variation of the actions to take. When things are similar, but with slight differences, it's much harder for me to remember than if things are extremely different. These variations, as well as the poor explanation contributed to the confusion.

Also, we found the iconography lacking because it was not really explained to us. We were unable to figure it out ourselves while we played so it was of no help. After reading the rules, I'd probably have a much better understanding of how to use the symbols, but it was not something that we were able to pick up on the fly.

Also we had a hard time remembering to pay the treasury cost for sponsoring an event. The symbol is under the green noble which I feel is an unintuitive place to put it. Maybe it should be on the card or on the location where you play the card. 

Now for my personal preference, with a longer deeper game like Lisboa, I prefer less randomness. I did not like that the cards you replenish are random (even though you have a choice of 3), but I understand this is just what I enjoy in games.

Also, when we chose starting church powers, since we knew nothing about the game, we chose randomly. Mine seemed to be useless, although I again understand that I know nothing about this game. My power allowed me to move the church rondel one extra space, which seemed vastly under powered to everyone else's. Maybe I just don't know how to use this ability to it's full extent? So It was upsetting that they seemed so imbalanced, although I concede I may just be unaware of the proper strategy of them.

My wife enjoyed the experience much more than us and now I'm 100% sure because she had the read the rules and we did not. However, she too did not enjoy the game as much as your other works, due to confusion of the actions.

It is difficult for me to understand why so many people think this game is lighter / easier than Kanban and Gallerist. Most of the people who demoed at BGG.CON (like Snoozefest) seem to agree that it is much more difficult. But maybe it is because of the way it was taught to us.

RATING: 10
If one were to look at my collection, they wouldn't see many 10s. I have a couple of games that round UP to 10, but this is my first one. I've liked Vital's other games a lot, particularly The Gallerist, but this one is even better. This is probably the lightest of his games that I have played, with there being basically 4 actions you can do. Every piece flows and clicks like finely crafted clockwork (as do most of his games). The solo mode is challenging, so even if I can't convince other people that this is a 10, then I can always strive to play better against the automa.

Interesting, very involved game with some frustrating graphic design choices that made it incredibly hard to learn and teach. I love most of Lacerda's games, and I am a huge fan of the Gallerist for its clear iconography and easy-to-follow rulebook. Not so for Lisboa. I really wish they had gone with more distinctive, larger icons for the three main actions, rather than these washed out, ugly drawings of old men. As it stands, the board and cards are so hard to read that the actions feel unintuitive and are incredibly difficult to remember. 

The game itself is great: challenging and interesting tasks, with lots of different ways to accomplish them. I like the "tucking" mechanism (it reminds me a bit of Bruxelles 1893), and think the building bonuses for street adjacency are fun, though tricky to pull off. Looking forward to playing this again (and maybe learning the ugly old men spaces better).

7/8/17: A complex card driven action selection game that unfortunately did not go down particularly well.  Although another play would go farther in helping to understand some of the subtleties of the mechanisms and their relationships,  I was disappointed in the not only the overall length of the game(over 5hrs for 4 players with 3 new albeit experienced Euro gamers),  but also some of the design decisions that were not helpful(the SUPER TINY font size on the tokens that made identification a chore.  Why??).  

Lacerda's designs in general are great,  and Lisboa is intriguing on it's own,  but for me it's a close miss for a game I was hoping to like a lot more.

7/17/17: Played again,  and although I played badly and still misinterpreted some key mechanics,  I was impressed enough that I pre-ordered the Deluxe version.  This is definitely a design worth exploring more in depth.  Much preferred to The Gallerist.

Vital has done it again. I thought Vinhos, Kanban and The Gallerist were works of genius in terms of game design and this game was no exception. How one guy can consistently make such great, thematic, heavy Euros is beyond me. Vital has to be one of the the greatest Euro games designers out there.

Deliciously brain numbing!  I suck at it and am not sure what I am doing and have lost (badly) twice.  When can I play again!  Not sure this one will top The Gallerist but willing to give it a go.  I hated Kanban but both The Gallerist and Lisboa seem to take the interconnectivity of it, and distill it to its elegant essence in different ways.

Very solid, heavy Euro with a really fascinating theme set in Lisboa after the city was destroyed by an earthquake, fire, and tsunami all at once! Turns are very simple since players can only play one card, but all the pieces are so well connected that one card could start a very satisfying combo. I played the deluxe version so the components were all top notch (even though a bit too small in some cases) and despite the busy board the artwork is beautiful. Would love to play this again but it is definitely for those who enjoy the brain-burning of a crunchy Euro game.

I think Vital Lacerda is satirizing himself claiming this is a lighter game than Gallerist or Kanban. He is pushing the extremes of what is manageable in terms of rule digestion and the number of available options. This is a heavy game by any definition. 

Once again though, the theme is well integrated and helps with the rules digestion. There are many different ways you can go, so the game is interesting. And the rules are actually fairly easy to remember from game to game, so marks for that.

One of the heaviest Euros I’ve played. There are so many options atrategies seem endless. I was constantly looking through the rules and asking questions throughout the game, there’s so much to know. I really like medium to heavy Euros and this one is right up there. Even with everything one can do it all blends together nicely and makes sense. The time it takes to play is worth the weight of the game. definitely a game that needs to be played consistently within a group to reach its potential.

An intricate game that avoids being as clunky and overwrought as The Gallerist.  The Player Aid (an 8-page pamphlet) doubles as Life Support System and is fairly well done -- but instead of including the end-of-game scoring elements (which it should), it lists the designer's "helpful hints" which basically boil down to "do everything first".  I liked the planning and engine-building required, and the hand management was important but not too random.  The "follow" mechanism is well-executed and adds another dimension to heads-up game play.  However, I can see the manner in which the Decree cards come out could -- particularly in a close contest -- unbalance play and turn the game chaotic.  I would rather see a larger static display than one where the card that will score a bucketload of points for multiple players appears right after the end of your turn; for a short game, that's fine, for a game this long and intense, it is an injustice.

My first Lacerda game, "Lisboa" proves its designer's reputation to be no mistake. It's a daunting game, one that requires you to accept that you'll be playing in a fog of confusion throughout your first few games. But oh, the intricacies, the interwoven systems! When their connections begin falling into place in your mind, you'll be soaring with possibilities! This is NOT a game where one path to victory trumps all others. To the contrary, you'll discover path after path once you grasp how everything works. It's satisfying when a game lets you play five different ways and win with each five. "Lisboa" is just that kind of game.

Yup, it's great. Of course. For those who are into the chunky Euros with multiple inter-connected systems. And like previous VL games, hearing the rules will leave you completely bewildered on what to do. After the first game I was (am) anxiously looking forward to the next, where I might have a clue what I'm doing at the beginning. Production-wise, it's a bit of a table hog. And the Clergy Tiles are small and rather hard to make out. And the money bits are a disaster (mini poker chips to the rescue). House rule: at the beginning of the game, rather than each player drawing a favor tile randomly, each player just chooses one. Green seems to just be better, as that's what people do first. We also tried draw 1 per player, and choose them in reverse player order, like the Decrees (when using that variant, which I will from now on). But we found players complaining.

What a piece of crap! A baroque convulsion of different game mechanics thrown together, with nothing holding them together. Could have cut out major part of the game (like the Influence mechanic) without anything feeling amiss. Vital at its best: complexity for complexities' sake.

Another euro that adds too many convolutions without really adding any corresponding fun, but it does increase the playing time. At the end of the day it's point salad action selection that runs about twice as long as I'm generally willing to put up with for most euros. The followup action mechanic can create a lot of downtime, too, which I did not enjoy.

To top it off, it has a rather obtuse set of rules with a "player aid" that comes in at 8 pages, which should tell you something.

This game is the definition of a heavy euro.  The player aid is a booklet!  I'm really liking Vital's latest designs.  Kanban, Gallerist, and Lisboa are all great.  The formula/mechanic is samey, but it works.  At face value there are just a couple of actions you can take, but each of those actions have a couple of sub actions.  And sometimes the decision tree goes more than 1 level down...ie, a sub-action could have 2 other sub-actions.  It sounds difficult, but after a few turns it starts to click.  The same can be said for the iconography.  It takes some getting used to.  This rating reflects just 1 play.  It could move up or down.  The piece I'm most concerned about is the opening play.  It seems like building a store is the most important thing to do.  More plays will tell if there are other equally viable openings.  I'd like to see the start player not try to build a store on turn 1.

Update after several plays:  Bumping up 8 --> 9.  Really enjoying it...still a hair below Kanban.

Is Lisboa perhaps an engine-salad game? You don't really build one primary engine. Instead, you look for opportunities to construct small efficiencies to make yourself better than your opponents at the various subsystems in the game. Then you look for decree cards that will award points in those areas where you excel.

Brilliant, complex, multi-layered Euro.

From the two games I have played by the designer of [thing=161533][/thing], and from what I know of some of his other games, I would not call myself a Vital Lacerda fan.  I love a complex Euro but CO2 was a bore to me and The Gallerist had too many unrelated mechanisms fighting for attention.  So I was expecting Lisboa to be more of the same.

Boy was I wrong.  This game is simply wonderful.  Whilst it does not quite have the elegance of Madeira, where the layers of complexity are expressed as a seamless integrated engine of beauty, it gets pretty damn close.  Lisboa to me is a wonderful array of interlocking mechanisms which make thematic sense and inter-relate to each other with brain-melting delight.  I have played it twice, done very badly on each occassion, and loved every minute of both games.

A must for all who love a heavy, thematic, smooth playing Euro.

So elegant, but with so many interlocking mechanisms resulting in a dazzling number of tactical and strategic options, and so many meaningful choices every turn -- each of them branching into multiple additional options, with their effects further rippling through the system on various levels.

The historical theme shines through brightly, the artwork/components are beautiful, the box serves nicely for storage and play (much like the box for The Gallerist), and there's an AI/bot included for solitaire play.

This I would consider as another typical Lascerda game - very complex and therefore hard to grasp. Once you have it'S fun, however, if you just play once every quarter, you have to start to learn the rules all over again. 
And everytime you then teach the game to new players, it will take AT LEAST half and hour to explain (rule overkill) .and it is most likely impossible to fully understand for most people after just one explanation.
As much as I like most of Lascerda'S game (Vinhos as my favorite): for the above reasons they are just too expensive for me to buy

If I could only keep one game in my collection this would be it. Obviously the theme helps but ultimately it is a brilliant design. 
Everything fits together and synergises perfectly. Fantastic integration of theme and mechanics. It has all my favourites things a Euro should have: tableau/engine building, multi-use cards, hand management and area control. There are no dead moments, you will always be thinking about what you should be doing and no 2 games are the same. There are so many ways to approach this game, but no matter your strategy, if players are of the same level scores will be very close.
As a plus, I find it plays very well at any player count.

Beautiful game and very tightly made euro!  Also one of the best player aids I have seen in a board game.

Thematically, it is not as rich as it could be because 1) it focuses on elements (such as political actions)  that are not the most thematically pungent aspects of the reconstruction of Lisboa  2) the combination of the heaviness of the mechanics, emphasis on euro elements, and the absence of certain thematic details (ie building descriptions)

Zunächst wusste ich über die Historie des Spiels nichts. Dann stolperte ich zufällig in eine dieser auf Drama gebürsteten Dokumentationen auf Phoenix oder NTV mit mieser 3D-Animation: das berühmte Erdbeben von Lissabon von 1755. Doch mit Erdbeben nicht genug. Nach dem großen Häuserwackeln wütete ein verheerendes Großfeuer in der Stadt. Danach schwappte ein Tsunami in die Altstadt und spülte die Menschen in den Tod. Den Rest erledigten marodierende Horden und Plünderer. Mit 30.000 bis 100.000 Todesopfern handelt es sich um eine der verheerendsten Naturkatastrophen der europäischen Geschichte. LISBOA beschreibt brettspielerisch den Wiederaufbau des Handelszentrums über einen Zeitraum von 22 Jahren mit den Mitteln des Lacerda: einfache Grundzüge, verspielte Verästelungen in die Unendlichkeit. Zumindest thematisch bleibt das Unglück treu: in China fackelte eine Lagerhalle mit rund 4.000 Spielen ab, die Backer in EU konnten von Eagle-Gryphon gerade eben noch so mit Restexemplaren aus USA bestückt werden. America first. Schade um die schönen Stücke, denn auch in LISBOA treffen sich Lacerda und der kongeniale Artpartner Ian O'Toole zu mediterraner Vollendung in den stadttypischen blau-weißen Wandkacheln, Azulejos genannt. Da haben sich nach den Großpaketen VINHOS DELUXE und GALLERIST Fix und Foxi gesucht und gefunden. Spielmechanisch bleibt auch LISBOA eine Fitzelschönheit portugiesischer Anmut. Lacerdas Kreationen sind und bleiben Liebhaberspiele. Der Fan jubelt, der Feind fühlt sich bestätigt. Die Rakete ON MARS steht zum Abflug zu den Sternen bereit, Commander Lacerda.

Need more time to think on this one. I think I liked it more than Vinhos, but possibly understood it less. I certainly did not fare well my first go around, and it may be this type of thing is a bit too heavy for me (or needs multiple playthroughs to "get").

The main reason I feel Vital Lacerda is such a brilliant designer is that he first lives and breathes his theme and then intelligently intertwines it with unique or novel mechanics that support the theme in the oddest, but most interesting ways.  I still believe Co2 is his most brilliant accomplishment and The Gallerist showed that he could truly marry heavy, complex design and still make it feel "elegant".  By these points alone, he stands as a stunning and possibly one of the most significant complex Euro designers.  Lisboa has many elements of Lacerda's games which I truly appreciate: his heart-felt devotion to theme; his pairing with artists that truly get what they need to do to make his designs shine; a staggering genius ability to provide byzantine interconnections between seemingly disparate aspects of the game. Lisboa checks off all the boxes here.  But there's one significant check-box that got left off for me that I have found in his other games: Lisboa is simply not fun.  The theme, though clearly personal for him, has a difficult task of surviving under the weight of its mechanics.  There is so much that has been packed into this game that it takes more mental gymnastics than I'd like to get on board with him and see where the theme comes through.  In the Gallerist this was an occasional problem, but light enough that it could be forgiven, especially given how the theme was able to shine through in many other ways.  But in Lisboa, the token/symbol overload pulls the entire experience down, and never did I "feel" the rebuilding of 18th-century Lisbon. It was 3 hours of procedural token acquisition, cube pushing, and card collecting.  And unlike The Gallerist, it does feel like that a couple of bad plays can really set you back, and Lisboa is opaque enough that it's sometimes difficult to intuit the worst moves from best during your first play (though Lacerda makes sure to put in enough "designer tips" throughout the rulebook).  The fact that it does hold together and in that way that only a few designers can achieve, is laudable. And I'm happy to say that my largest points of detraction are purely opinion, and there are many people who love Lisboa and can feel the theme, or at the very least enjoy the mechanics of it all.  For me, Lacerda is always one toe into excess, but that touch of madness is what gives all his games their character.  With Lisboa, it feels like he is treading in the deep end, and left me thinking of Lisboa as an overtangled, bullish game- but with heart.

I never thought I'd learn it so easily, but this has to be one of Vital Lacerda's most accessible games. First of all, the art is ridiculously stunning. The board itself should be hanging on a wall by my games. Secondly, the game flows well, and being able to only play a single card each round is fantastic.  Finally, the rulebook - despite being for a fairly complex, big game - is very well-written.

Lisboa takes a while to familiarize yourself with the icons and process of actions but worth the learning curve for sure.  There are plenty of ways to score and build your ability to do so.  The quality and beauty of this game is quite noticeable when playing.  This designer and publisher duo make for memorable and deep games that last and make you think about them long after playing.

Lovely game from Vital, probably hard to enter the game, but not so hard once you understand the flow of the game. You have to play your cards for bribing the nobles and do some actions, and try to follow other players in their turns to get advantage of actions.
Would say that is a great game having you concentrated all the time, beautiful at sight, and beautiful playing

Like fine wine, this game gets better and better upon repeated plays. The game plays so smoothly and the decisions are so interesting. The card play mechanic is very fresh for a Lacerda title and everything is so thematic. The board is beautiful and the component quality is amazing, as you would expect from an Eagle-Gryphon production. This is easily Lacerda's best and is fighting for the number one spot in my all-time list. What I love the most about this game is that after people are familar with the rules (which is admittedly a challenge), the game plays quickly. A four player game can easily play out in 1:45 or thereabouts, making this the perfect mix of high strategy that doesn't overstay its welcome.

Point hoarding that is not necessary. Money should be the victory points since we are businessmen. Everything that just gives vps without doing anything else are superfluous and unnecessary (like the decrees). VP game systems are archaic and a lazy way to determine a winner.

Not a bad game, but it's waaaaaaayyy to complicated without getting something in return for it. There's also nothing new to it. It feels and plays like a good (and known) strategy game, but with double/tripple the rules for no reason.

Even though you would get better at it, I have no desire to play it again, as there's just nothing special to it. I rather play other games with a similar feel and half the rules in less time.

Short: Fine game, but with all the other games available, this stands no ground at all.

Just played for the first time. I like euro games. However, this game, after I got the flow of it, is the first game that had me so engaged/excited that I spent a large portion of every one of my turns standing up out of my chair. It was absolutely bonkers amazing and I absolutely cannot wait to play this again.

I did play this again and I had a great time. It shaved off less than 10% of game time from the first game, but I feel like it's my fault. I had a strategy in mind going into the game and me doing one thing that seemed obviously good for my strategy actually made it very difficult for us to get a lot done quickly in the first age. Funny thing is, even though I knew exactly what caused the problem, and my hand in it, it only just now occurred to me (one week later) this thing was actually counter to my strategy. It seems so obvious now that I feel embarrassed to say exactly what it was, but I can confirm that with two plays, and a little thought, the mud, algea, and debris in the waters surrounding this game have settled quite nicely and now I am basking on the sunny beach of Lacerda's beautiful island paradise. Favorite Lacerda game (first Lacerda game, but I love it)!

RATING: 10
This game is a special 10, it's technically an 11 compared to all the other 10s, it's a solid 10 in terms of gameplay but what this game has that others don't is the true inspiration of the designer to create a game with a theme really close to his heart. By playing this game you can feel the pride and love that Lacerda has for the city of Lisboa and for Portugal. The mechanics are so thematic and the everything from the art to the rulebook shines with theme and passion. 

If you truly want to see a game that was designed with passion and love, this is it. Considering the times we are in, I can't help but draw comparisons with currently popular games such as Rising Sun. A game supposedly themed around Feudal Japan, designed by caucasians who all they did was do a quick Wikipedia search for Japanese sounding names. That's not passion, that's not inspiration. That's a halfhearted, disrespectful approach to thematic boardgame design.

Lisboa manages to have amazingly cleverly designed mechanics that are also incredibly thematic, from the way you sell goods to the way you build upon the rubbles of the destroyed city, simulating the "Gaiola Pombalina", as well as the attention to details, like specifying the proper spelling of Real and Reis. Just reading through the rulebook, I felt I was learning about the history of Lisboa.

Common criticism to this game, perpetrated by many popular reviewers seems to be revolving around the complexity of the game. I believe that to be a misleading and lazy criticism at best. The game is not unnecessarily complex. It's complexity adds layer upon layer of depth and options, as well as paths to victory and due to this depth, it's only logical that it takes longer to learn and master it. The feeling of satisfaction in knowing you are doing the right moves that you might feel early on in simpler games, is delayed in Lisboa. It's not simple to figure out and I believe that's amazing. Often we hear that the harder things in life are the things that grant the most satisfaction, this couldn't be more true with Lisboa, provided someone is willing to work for it. Someone might want simpler gratification and that's perfectly fine, but that's not a valid reason to criticize a game. Criticizing Lisboa for it's complexity is like criticism a sport because it's too hard to learn to become good at.

Last but not least, the design and art direction of this game are sublime. The board alone is so intricate that you could spend hours just starting at it and keep finding new clever little details that you missed on previous looks. It could be framed and hanged on a wall. What's even more remarkable is that the design is not only good to look at but it actually serves a purpose to the gameplay. Almost nothing on the board is placed as fluff, everything is there for a reason.

This game is an absolute masterpiece.

This is a really cool game. The multi-use cards work great, the way that the players can control which shops will score where is really cool, there are all sorts of special powers and scoring goals you can draft throughout he game, and just in general it does a really good job of making every action you take have multiple different consequences to different systems, which is one of my favorite things as it forces you to really consider things from different angles at the same time and balance multiple systems at once. Overall, I think all of the ideas are really good, and they work well together. I can definitely see this going into my top 10 with more plays but for whatever reason at this point it was just not quite there.

Lisboa consists of a wonderous series of mechanisms, but the game feels needlessly complex. There are a lot of really enjoyable systems (such as racing to build structures and optimizing shipping), but those systems get buried behind the bureaucracy of performing the actions needed to manipulate them. Trying to respond to constantly changing costs and availability of these choices makes it feel like fighting the game rather than the other players. Perhaps more games of this will make it feel less difficult to navigate, but as of now, the complexity presented has not led to an overly enjoyable experience.

In Lisboa, players are contributing to the rebuilding of Lisbon destroyed by earthquake, fires and a tsunami. As a result, building sites are littered with rubble specific to all three disasters. Players build stores to produce goods and contribute to public works so that their stores score points. When you build a store or public work you collect rubble from the sites and every set of three different kinds of rubble increases the size of your warehouses, the size of your tableau and allows you to draw extra goal cards when you take that action. You can also sell goods overseas for money and the owner of the ship that sells it (you or another player) gets points. At game's end you get points for having the most stores on a particular street, for placing your "officials" into public buildings (which is a requirement for building them), for every set of rubble, for money, for ships, and for the goal cards that you've collected.

How does all of this work? Players have a hand of five cards. On a turn you can play a card to your tableau (called your "portfolio") or to the court on the main board. Cards added to your tableau give you a one-time bonus when added and influence points ongoing and possibly a monetary benefit. Most cards also allow you to take 1-2 state actions for the cost of a good each. State actions allow you to produce goods in your stores, build ships, collect royal favors, prepare officials for public service, sue for favors from the cardinal, or collect plans for public works (also required to build them). If you play a card to the court, this allows you to build stores, build public works or collect goal cards - and other players can play favors to piggy-back on your action out of turn. 

So just with this brief summary, you can see the interconnectedness of all actions. While it is pretty clear what actions are available to you, it is initially hard to wrap your head around just how connected they are and how to best leverage them. However, after a play, it certainly starts to clarify. Since it takes a few games to "get in the flow", it is challenging to know just where my opinion will end up landing, but I definitely am interested enough to find out!

Wanted to like this game more, was happy to learn it directly from Vital Lacerda when he showed up to demo it at Origins 2017.  The artwork, presentation and packaging of this game are spectacular (hence the high price tag), would call it kind of a luxury item in one's game collection.  However, the learning curve is steep, and play can drag (due to AP and the reaction phase of player turns).  Good idea to include a player booklet which eases the learning curve and helps with the iconography, but disappointed that they didn't make those tiny numbers on the decree cards and clergy tiles a bit bigger.  

On balance, not as good as CO 2 or the Gallerist, which are my two favorite Lacerda titles to date.

A Vital game that I don't love, who knew this could happen?!?

I find the system of actions in the game stifling. Usually Vital's games allow the player to act with some freedom, but Lisboa is very heavy handed in the actions you have access to, but more importantly which ones make sense for you to do. 

I also find the marker that sets the money/influence modifiers to be poorly integrated into the rest of the system. It seems to move up and down (or not at all) with no discernible connection to the strategies being pursued by the players.

If boardgames can approach art, Lisboa gets as close as possible. Lacerda stays true to his principles in this gorgeous production. Another heavy Euro making no compromises, strictly for hardcore gamers. Rules explanations will take at least 30 minutes, the game itself will fill a game night by itself. 

The basic structure sounds simple. Play a card, take a card. Almost like Kingdom Builder. A card can be played to the own depot or the court on the board. Depending on the choice, two different actions for each possibility, i.e. a total of four actions, are available. Doesn't sound complicated. The depth hides in the multitude of details and implications of each action which will paralyze AP prone players, deter casual gamers and annoy even many seasoned gamers with its procedural nature.

The name of the game is efficiency. Cardinal tiles improve actions, costs differ in the course of time, majorities have to be gained with as few input as possible. Some strategic focus helps to make the most of decree (=VP) tiles at game end although the game is more on the tactical side. Which I consider to be a good thing.

I'm drawn to Lisboa with its opulent production and the gorgeous artwork. At the same time, the first game was an exhausting experience with a close result that leaves me wondering if the output justifies the necessary input. I've also played his other major games Vinhos, Kanban and Gallerist only once so far. This shall be the first Lacerda game I will make an effort to explore more to finally pass a judgment if I like his style of game design or only respect it and buy his deluxe games for their outstanding production value.

Second play with four players. Game is most interesting and balanced with this player count. The two game end conditions arrive at approx. the same time. The majority contest is most interesting. Too bad, that the game takes quite long at this number.

I’m a big fan of some of Vital’s previous games such as Gallerist and Vinhos, so I was pretty sure this would be a hit for me. Lisboa certainly can be a tough nut to crack, it isn’t that complex but the actions are very much interwoven, and getting the hang of setting yourself up for future turns is a bit of a learning curve. However this game pays off with repeated plays, there’s both tactical and strategic elements to the gameplay and executing a good combo turn is very satisfying.

Vital's games are always the right amount of fiddly for me. I LOVE the way all of the mechanics interact and just enjoy the process of playing the game. It's complex enough that I'm sometimes looking for the best point differential in a turn, but not always. Often I'm just saying "I need more plans" and following actions based on that. I love the complexity of the games so far (only have played Gallerist and Lisboa) and love the component quality of the games. At this point new kickstarters by Eagle Gryphon for Vital games are a instant-back.

Not for everyone, but exactly what I want in a heavier game right now!

One point in order to help people figure out if this game is for them. The player aids are 8 pages long and have a player aid summary on the last page of the player aid...

12-12-2017 - I've played a single solo learning game, and I'm not a solo gamer.  So the experience was a little tedious and dreadful.  But I have high hopes for the game if I can get someone else to play it with me.  Lots of stuff going on in this one to keep track of, decisions to be made, good stuff.  7 for now.

12-26-2017 - Played a 2p with P last night.  I really like it, though the iconography is difficult.  I have to constantly look up Decree cards and Clergy tiles.  Kind of a pain.  P had no idea what she was doing until the very end (despite my brilliant teaching ability, haha).  She wasn't a fan.  Still, I really like how you have to keep on top of your engine.  If you start meandering away from what you should be doing, it can be tough to get back on track.  At least that's what it feels like after 2 plays now.  That might be a negative for some people, but I like it.  It's a game, play it well!  Anyway, think I'll bump it to a 7.5, keeping it kind of low due to the difficult iconography and constantly having to look things up.  But I do like it quite a bit.

RATING: 8
After two completely different games i have to say i really like the game.

Because of price reductions from clergy tiles or treasury cards   the ships only have very limited use in this game. And are predominantly used to gain influence. after the build ship action.
I would have thought money was tighter in this game. And  the ships had to sail out more.
The visit a noble action when you play a card to your tableau is not something that is done very often.. So you don't need a lot of goods.  This means production is also an action that takes place only about three times in a game. With people not seeing the use of extra production..
This can change with decree cards possibly. But so far that doesnt come up.
As of now i rate the game an 8. If there are games with ships or production being more important the rating might go up.
First game scoring was decree heavy. Second game stores scoring made the difference as most decrees that came up were not player specific  and more about position of public buildings.. 

The best thing about this game probably is that rubble clearing is well rewarded.
So that really makes the theme come through together with the designated streets.

I don't know if the game needed the lavish production. I would have been perfectly happy with a  whats your game production for half the price..

Rating on pricepoint.  For that matter is 6/10
Production is 9/10. The insert needed a  couple of times an extra mm..
The back of the era cards these that are shuffled and those that are not showed great attention to detail.
Great thick cardstock
The money. I wasnt too impressed.

Oh and about weight i think this is a middle weight.
It might feel lighter than it is because of all the logical actions.
But i can teach this to 12 years easily
Not a lot of stuff to remember really.

As with all Vital Lacerda games, the rules take 2 hours to learn. I'm not convinced there is a sufficient ROI on so many rules, especially given that his games aren't even thematic. Consummately inelegant design. However, the game was enjoyable - better than kanban - and I'd definitely play again.

Vital Lacerda's best game to date!  He is the master of making a big Euro seem effortless and smooth.  Game play mechanics weave themselves magically together to give the game a huge fun factor. The historical information in the text and in the game elevates it even further.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is another typical Lacerda game with lots of intertwined mechanisms and actions but the central conceit is pretty straightforward - "play a card, draw a card." There's obviously much more involved, but you are basically choosing between several different actions dependent upon what cards you play where. Setup is a bit of a pain and takes some time and the insert wasn't designed very well - I was disappointed with the insert considering previous designs from Eagle. Easier to teach than most of the other Lacerda's. There is still the claim a tile/card for end game scoring common to his designs. 

There is also a bit of tableau building in this one called adding to your portfolio which grants special bonuses in certain situations moving forward. This game gives the deception of one in which you take your time to build up your engine but you need to rev it up quickly and motor along almost from the get go as you have very limited actions - probably around a dozen give or take 1-2. If you have the appropriate favor, there are certain actions you can follow when someone takes that type of action and those can be powerful although you usually have less choices when you follow. 

Hoping to continue to explore this one more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another very good Vital Lacerda that feels very much like his other games.  I like the light historical theme and enjoy the interactions of all of the moving parts of this game.  The various ways the cards can be played were a bit overwhelming at first when trying to form a strategy but the basic mechanics are straightforward enough. I will need to explore this one further.

RATING: 8
My first impression of this game is I love it, but it will be difficult to get to the table and to teach. It was, however, not as difficult to get into as I expected, having never played a Lacerda game. The main problem was just getting my head around all the possible actions, since there is some overlap and the decision tree wasn't completely intuitive or obvious. The weight is not from the rules, all of which I had no problem remembering, but from analysis paralysis, which I had to make a conscious effort to avoid. The game flies by surprisingly quickly if you don't think too long!

Things I loved:

- You never have everything you need! You have to plan ahead, or just work with what you have. Plotting a course out of a seeming disaster to a good turn is deeply satisfying.
- The theme comes through very strongly. You really feel like you are rebuilding the city, and all of the rules make sense in that context.
- Everything affects everything and *everyone* else.
- Sandbox feel. Your accomplishments and strategies may vary greatly from game to game.
- Very beautiful and thick components, incredible player boards. Gorgeous on the table.
- Excellent and very clear rules, with many historical interludes and designer notes!

Things I didn't love:

- The tiny reference numbers on decree cards and clergy tiles. I'm not so old my eyes are going, but I still need a magnifying glass. Not awesome. At least I did get good at interpreting the icons without looking them up.
- Player boards bowed a LOT while we played. That was kind of disappointing, but not a huge deal. It makes the backstop pointless.
- The decree cards feel a little tacked on. Many seem quite arbitrary.

One of the heaviest games I have ever played.  At its heart, you play a card on your turn, but like the Gallerist you are trying to leach off of other player's actions.  You are trying to rebuild Lisbon after a earthquake, file and tsunami.  It is very interesting game.  Too much to the game to describe in this small space.  

I like the game.  Not as much as Kanban, which is so great, but it is very close.  I like the art and it is a fun game.

Larceda does it again. I love how the game really changes over the course of the play.  The variable use cards and variable setup give great replayability.  The depth of the actions also lets you play multiple different ways.  Will you be a merchant who produces a few small commodities, using your Portfolio and Clergy influence to drive up the prices?  Or an industry tycoon, who mass produces and focuses on selling in quantity rather than quality? 
There are so many intertwining mechanisms and currencies.  Reis, Influence, Rubble, Wigs, Favors, Church Tiles, Decrees...  I'm constantly impressed by how Vital manages to seamlessly weave these in thematically.   

+ Lots of depth
+ Game evolves with distinct strategy shifts required between early, mid, and late game
+ Variable use action cards create nice brain burn
+ Absolutely beautiful production
+ Great thematic integration, especially with the earthquake mechanism
+ Lots of great historical tidbits on cards and in rulebook make the game come alive
+ Variable setup
- Sheer number of actions and calculations create a steep initial learning curve
- Setup can be a bit long/fiddly
- Complete table hog

Lisboa is a game that demands a lot of its players and returns a brilliant, complex, and deep experience in return.

Under the deceptive guise of "there are two types of cards and you can play them in one of two ways" (plus a fifth, nobody-ever-takes-this-action), the spider web reveals itself. No particular action is difficult or hard to understand (building a store involves adding together one to six variables valued between 1-5... that's as tough as it gets), but EVERYTHING ties into everything else and has some ripple effect.

Teaching this game can be rough, as there are a lot of moments where you hit the "This impacts that, but we didn't get to that yet, so just know that this impacts that and we'll get to why that matters in a bit". That said, the theme is actually a really strong player aid in guiding players as to why and how their actions matter. (The cardinal hitting the Treasury and Influence squares is probably the strongest example of this, but almost everything in this game relates to some historical event or thematic tie-in with what's represented on board).

Visually, the game is gorgeous and the components (especially in the Kickstarter version) are some of the best I've ever encountered. Everything from player tableaus having catches to keep cards from being push in too far, to recessed slots for cubes and pieces, this game takes build quality to the next level.

If you like Lacerda's other games or you're in the market for a meaty, heavy Euro that you can dedicated an afternoon to, you'll definitely find a lot of love here.

It took a couple of plays to get into this one, but it then shot up to sit with Vital's top 3.

It will take more plays to find out what position in the top 3 this takes, but it is a solid contender.

I always think I should like Vital Lacerda's games more than I actually do. The games are intriguing and generally beautifully presented, but they've often left me feeling a little underwhelmed.

So, why am I enjoying Lisboa so much? I'm not really sure, but it's the first of his games to truly click with me. Perhaps it is that I enjoy city-building games, and you are (re)building a city in Lisboa. Also, I believe the game has good thematic integration, but maybe I'm just lured in by the expository text in the rulebook. However, for once, all the interlocking systems in the game make sense in the context of the theme and the gameplay. Finally, I enjoy the card play and hand management aspects quite a bit, but that's no big surprise for me.

Ultimately, one of the better more recent euros I've played, especially considering that I've grown a little weary of this style of game in the last year or so.

EDIT: Upping my rating to 8.5. While I'm still a little leery of Lacerda's maximalist design ethos, I find this is keeping me engaged with each play. That's more than I can say of other recent games of this style.

In person, this game looks amazing!  It's a lavishly produced game and from a component and artistic point-of-view, it is a joy to play.  But there are a lot of mechanisms in the game making the rules feel complex and fiddly.  The interlocking mechanisms are like a series of gears: you turn one thing over here and then 10 other things happen because of it.  There's a lot to do here & it's all very cool.  I think that if I have the opportunity to play it more, my rating will go up.

Rating is tentative based on 2 plays. The first was enjoyable but frustrating as it is easy to get into traps of lacking influence, goods or money. 2nd was solo--helped nail down a few rules which eluded us the first play. 

A fiddlier game than Kanban or The Gallerist, with a staggering number of decrees and clergy tiles and cards in play. Still not entirely clear on how to go about converting the various resources to actual points, given the complexity of the mechanisms, but it's certainly an intriguing puzzle, though I'm not finding it so far as gripping as Kanban which feels far more like a tight logic puzzle (mapping out the relative positions of all the players for the next turn or two, figuring out where to sit for the meetings).... this one just has you chasing after so much STUFF and it all helps in various ways. Dunno.

UPDATE: dropped to 7. I suspect that concentrated play is needed to develop a real strategy for this game. At the moment it feels mostly like one gets a bunch of points for doing a huge array of things, but it's hard to develop a clear ENGINE or even a coherent overarching plan.

A heavy VL game but a lot more polished that the other games I have played of his (Vinhos 2016 & Gallerist).

The actions flow well together, the bonus follow on actions are rare/costly and therefore spent wisely rather than freely.

The building section is where the points are scored and it initially feels like a huge accomplishment to even get one building on there, but soon you're stuck considering where to place your buildings to ensure maximum benefit for you and nothing for your opponents.

Vital makes his most personal and beautiful game to date with Lisboa, a game which simulates the rebuilding of Portugal's capital after an earthquake, a tsunami and three days of fires devastated the city. Players will construct public buildings, new stores for cloth, books, and tools, and their own portfolio. The game design features three historical figures for the main actions of the game: the principal architect who gives public building plans and builds stores, the Prime Minister who decrees (VP-scoring cards) and lets players produce goods and hire ships, and the king who opens public buildings and grant access to the cardinal (powerful bonuses and influence). With Lacerda's previous games, the key to victory was selecting the right actions at the right time. But with Lisboa, Vital has provided something special: player powers. At the beginning of the game, players select from two a single unique clergy tile that will stay with them throughout the game. And using this power often is a great way to get ahead in the game because, without it, Lisboa can seem punishing and every action can seem expensive and ineffective. The game is divided into two periods that are signaled by the accumulation of "rubble" cubes or the evaporation of the deck of cards. And, smartly, the game's progress crawls in the first half to acclimate players to the design of the game's actions and strategy. In the second half, players have hopefully learned the game's basic actions to plan for more effective turns. The new cards are far more powerful which allows players to build stores and public buildings faster and accumulating more decree cards for the end of the game. Lisboa's emphasis on specialization is the gift and curse of the experience; your powers are unique, yes, but that means learning how each power affects the game can overwhelm and confuse players. There wasn't a turn where I wasn't consulting my ten-page player aid for the description of a clergy tile or decree card or to make sure I was still performing my actions correctly. Lisboa will occupy your brain for a solid five to six hours of your day; this is a warning to other players as well as a compliment to the designer. But I'm not a stranger to his other games. Vital regularly makes games for the serious, non-casual gamer who enjoys engine-building over victory points salads, skill over luck and theme over mechanics. His game excel in every aspect: design, components, strategy, and engrossing game play; it was four in the morning when we finished but I didn't notice. Every turn was meaningful, strategic and stressful. Having only played once, I have to say Lisboa captured my interest faster than Vinhos or The Gallerist and that is because of the theme: I admire Lacerda for crafting a game that was so personal to him. (Anyone can make a fantasy-adventure themed game. Vital is the only designer who can make a game about the effort to rebuild the Portuguese capital in 1755 that forever changed how their buildings were built, how their streets were made, and how they gained greater economic independence from Great Britain.) Lisboa is Lacerda's masterful, brilliant gift, not only to gamers, but to his country's history and contribution to European philosophy and politics. I can't wait to play again!

Just Kickstarted this today. As a fan of Rosenberg's heavier sandbox games, this looks like my kind of game. After reading the rulebook, I'm getting a sense that the designer is wandering into Phil Eklund levels of mechanical simplicity/strategic complexity. That's not a criticism, mind you, because I like a number of Eklund's games.

Update: A fire burned the components for the games slated for EU buyers. Hopefully, we see this game by the end of the year. Until then, I still have plenty of other games to play but this is disappointing.

Until this company starts producing games, or "normal quality" versions of games, that us plebes can afford, this game gets a 1. I gave a '1' to the gallerist for the same reason and that was only $100. Oh,  the good old days when Lacerda's games were cheap! Now, we are getting to $180.  Does this come with a free kick in the nuts,  or is that an extra on kick starter? 

As someone who is not a slobbering fanboy, and still lives in a world where pricing does matter, who cares about tiles that are a half inch thick? Who cares that the box weighs 2lbs more than the last game he released?  Is this the new Lacerda metric of game evolution? Some idiot actually showed pictures of this in the forum, comparing "large boxes, large tiles" to normal boxes, like it was a good reason to pay $130 more.  Is this the new measure of game quality? These are detriments to me. I don't need boxes that are twice the size of a normal box,  that don't fit on the shelf.  I don't need boxes that weigh twice as much as a normal box, that have tiles three times as thick as normal tiles.  Excess cardboard...such a valuable commodity. I read his next kickstarter game, 'The kitchenist', includes a 1.5 inch thick game board made out of alderwood and maple that can also be used for chopping brocolli. Only $250 if you pledge now. 

The fact that Lacerda is okay with this price gouging is disturbing. Is the game three times as good as Trajan, Keyflower, Vinhos, which cost $50? If so, sign me up, because it's the second coming of Christ. Hallelujah! All hail the new God. 

What is even more sad is that the game might be good, but Lacerda is going to not only lose many potential NEW customers because of the pricing, he's going to lose old customers, who already know his games, but are sick of the price gouging. This company makes Splotter look bargain bin.  Hey, EGG, whatever rocks your boat.  If you want to pimp out games to the top 0.01% of the population who are happy to pay this amount of money, and find solace in your elitist prestige of  "limited run of 500" to justify this cost, fine.  Maybe put a big sticker on the box: "Your $180 helps Vital design games full-time."  With this company, and with this pricing, it appears Vital no longer cares about his games getting into as many hands as possible.  Strange modus operandi from a game designer. Sure, I'll kickstart this...with my foot right up EGG's ass.

I have played all of Vital's games and feel this game is one of his best... maybe even his best game to date.

What I like so much about Lisboa is the tension of mastering the opportunities on the board before other players. This is a similar feel for me as in Kanban. I believe that once a player gets to understand the dynamics of how everything is so elegantly intertwined he/she will understand the masterpiece that this game really is. I have playtested this game 5 times. When you win this game by outplaying the other players and taking advantage of opportunities on the gameboard that are available to all players you will truly appreciate the competitive interactive elegance of this game. I feel that if you don't recognize the race to cash in on these opportunities and only look at this game as a point-salad, you will probably not do well or appreciate the beautiful design of Lisboa. It's like a big puzzle and the player who sees the crack in the code and seizes those opportunity will execute really well in this game. I feel that understanding the relationship and public availability of decree cards, street locations for stores, and public building is really the key to doing well in this game.

I generally like complex Euros and this one has some great mechanics that require more than a single play to appreciate. Certain points can be easily obtained while others have to be earned thus you need to know what to chase after from the start and not waste time on obtaining points that you can get at the end with little effort. The links between all the sections are not evident at first but once you all know how to play there is a lot of back and forth and the game is close in scoring at the end, rare for such complex games with so many points. The opponents actions have significant consequences on other plays making this one of the better ones. After two plays I like it and would need one or two more to really decide.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating. The impenetrable rulesbooklet which is not even able to layout exactly how the game works (don´t tell me this is a good rulesbooklet, it is not. Far from it, I can show you hundreds of better ones) makes learning this a chore. It also does not explain really how to win the game or basic strategies. 

So, we have to sit down and take it all from the beginning. But after two hours of setup and explanation, slowly, but surely, you grasp some concepts. Then, after two more hours, you understand what Vital wanted to tell us. Play a card, do something and make sure, when the others play, you gain an advantage out of their action. 


Unfortunately, he added more stuff on top of this and made an otherwise rather simple game idea into a beast. So, some might argue, there is a lot of complexity for the sake of complexity and looking up every decree card is a must in your first plays. But once it clicks, it clicks and becomes a wonderful example of heavy gaming in the Euro crowd. It might be the apogee of Eurogaming encompassing all what is right or wrong about the genre. But one does not fail to admire the game as it stands. It is a brain burner and even several plays can only bring more depth to the approach to it. 

I rate it an 7 because I am still willing to play this and would even suggest this. I am not done with it. I could not, so the journey continues. And  due to the complexity, the journey is a mental exercise which rewards. 'High-Fives around the table' Fun might be elsewhere, but if puzzles are yours, go out and get it. 

And if you think point salad and Feld did this better with Trajan. You may be right.

Like the other Vital Lacerda games, Lisboa is a complex game full of interlocking parts.  There are three major actions you can take on a turn--building a shop, building a public building, or taking a card from the display of end-game bonus cards.  Each of these actions has a number of side-actions that can be performed along with it, or instead of it, and depending on how you play your action card, different parts of each action and different symbols on the card can be activated.  Scoring points revolves around placing both public buildings and shops, as the latter acts as multipliers for the former.  Furthermore, for shops you need money, for public buildings you need officials, and for any action you need influence--and gathering these resources requires following a different path of secondary actions.  Suffice to say, this one is difficult to wrap your head around in the first play.  Once you start to grok the game, though, it seems pretty fun to try to plan out your path through the game without hitting roadblocks.

Yet another Vital game that does absolutely nothing for me. This game is like Trajan, but unlike Trajan, each action is unclear or unintuitive or requires a constant refresher of how the hell it works. This game is about the same rules complexity as well just with so many more convoluted steps to get there. I can see the appeal for some gamers, and I'm quite a fan of heavy games, but this is just overwrought. The decree cards feel like far too much of a focus and I really think it should be limited to how many you can have.

On a side note, his games are WAY too damn overproduced. This could have been a $60-70 game. No way in hell I'm paying $100+ for these giant cardboard monsters.

I put this game at a cautious 5. I seriously doubt it will rise and actually may continue to fall with repeat play(s). I'm not holding my breath for this one.

I bought this through the French distributor (Philibert) rather than the Kickstarter because Eagle-Gryphon's KS pricing was so high. Aside from the huge cashflow advantage of having full upfront payment, their direct sale through KS also meant they were making a huge saving on the percentages taken by distributors and retailers, yet it looked like none of that saving to them was being passed on to backers. Buying through Philibert saved me a small amount on the KS but they were able to supply the same 'Deluxe' version sent to KS backers (ie: with KS stretch goals).

++If you want a gamers'game, you will get one
+There seems to be a lot you can do
- don't like the color scheme, it makes some things confusing
-- The number of different icons on the clergy-tiles and decree cards is huge. And the number for looking things up is small, very, very small, which makes that if you're sitting at a distance you'll have to disturb an other player in asking which numbers are available. And all that looking up will create a lot of extra downtime in your first games, until everybody somehow understands most of the icons.

This game is overly complicated in that special Vital way, but the parts fit together  a little more cohesively than previous games. That's not to say that this game could't use a little streamlining, but I guess if you are into Vital's style of game this is probably your bag. It took me 3/4ths of the way through my first game before I started really understanding the flow and consequences of the different action options.

The game flow is pretty nice. There are a dizzying number of options to do on your turn, but ultimately it comes down to play a card, then do 2 things based on the card you played and where you played it to. The graphic design helps and hurts in different ways. When you need to do something, there's usually an indicator reminding you to do it, however, the board layout and artwork is disorientingly busy. The icons are very small, and the numbers to look up what the icons mean are even smaller. This is also a game where you can expect to still be looking up what icons do even deep into the game, as some icons are used to mean two different things depending on the context of their appearance, and other icons are used only once and then never again.

The player interaction in this game is more about predicting your opponents and trying to piggy back their moves more than it is about actually being able to do much to get in their way and hurt their scores. There are some surprising but minor luck elements of the game such as the order in which endgame scoring cards come out onto the display, and the tokens you start with.

Generally I like the experience of this game. Playing it does wear me out however, whereas a really solid medium euro will energize me. This is probably my favorite Vital game so far, and I'm still exploring what that means for me.

This game certainly has a lot going on, but if you are willing to slog through your first game and refer back to the rule book over and over again, everything starts to come together towards the end of the game.

It is a very interesting and well designed game. The resources are all very tight and need to be managed efficiently. There's a lot going on to keep track of, but it all works well.

RATING: 9
[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) [b]Intertwined game mechanics:[/b] The game engine is a masterpiece of beautifully intertwined mechanics (something Vital Lacerda is known for) - yet its core is a simple card driven action system. You have 2 basic types of action cards (noble and treasury) you can play in 2 different ways: placing them on the game board or building them onto your personal player board. Depending on where you place the card, you can chose one of two base actions, meaning there are only 4 base actions which the game is built upon. An elegant and easy to understand base which drives the entire game which spawns possibilities to players in its more complex intertwined mechanics which kick in after a base action gets chosen. Some examples of intertwined mechanics: many actions influence the height of the royal treasury, which in turn makes some actions more or less appealing. The 3 basic resources in the game: money, goods (4 types) and influence are required to take actions, they can get converted into one another and you can get them by taking the right actions. Obtain clergy tiles by playing different types of actions, and in turn they will empower other game styles or future actions. etc etc

(+) [b]Positive player interaction:[/b] I personally love positive player interaction and Lisboa is bustling with it! You can ship your goods earning you money using opponents ships (granting them wigs/points). Opening public buildings will score your shops, but also matching shops from your opponents. Visiting a noble might open up opportunities for opponents to 'follow' your visit, granting them an extra action. Some of your actions will change the state of the royal treasury, making certain actions for players taking turns after you more or less appealing, ... There is a huge amount of player interaction in Lisboa, but only little 'take that'-moments. The meanest player interaction is situated in competition for the best spots for shops and public buildings, in increasing the influence price your opponents need to pay in order to visit a noble and in not quite fully loading ships :) - which is okay... You won't lose friends playing Lisboa, player interaction mainly revolves around thinking about ways to get things done without giving away too many benefits to your opponents.

(+) [b]Beautiful and durable game components:[/b] I honestly regret the rising cost of our boardgame hobby (where are the days in which it was possible to buy clever and beautifully designed boardgames for less than € 40?), but I have to say Lisboa turned out to be a great production with sturdy components, a beautiful game board + very functional player boards. It is a feast for the eyes and a joy to handle those components! The only design choice I dislike it the unhandy format of the manual (folding out the manual takes up half of your table space) and the money tokens (5 coins is represented not by a small coin with a '5' printed on it, but by an annoing token depicting 5 '1'-coins: why oh why?!)

(+) [b]Epic scope, game mechanics are thematically integrated:[/b] I love the fact that this game has its theme integrated in its mechanics. It is a complex game, but what you do and what the effects are of what you are doing makes thematic sense: you get a subsidy so the royal treasury drops. A public building gets opened in the street in which your book shop is located: jeej - this increases the value of your shop! The manual offers historical background information about the thematic integration in this game, and this is educational in terms of learning about the history of Lisbon, but it also helps a great deal in understanding the game. It also makes the game feel 'epic', because what you do feels logical, it is no abstract puzzle of intertwined mechanics without a story.

(+) [b]Rewarding game which grows the possibilities of players playing it right:[/b] This game 'grows' beautifully: at the beginning, the game puts players up with a stiff challenge: shops are insanely expensive at first but you need them to get started. Once you find your way through these difficulties, the game really rewards you by growing your possibilities: good players will soon find they can get more done with the precious actions than their opponents. More cards in your portfolio (player board) makes you more powerful, more shops reaps more goods easily, more clergy tiles powers up your play and big ships convince opponents to ship their goods using your harbour). In the beginning of the game you find yourself struggling to take little steps, but when you take the right ones which aid your strategy, you can take big leaps in the second half of the game.

(+) [b]Challenging:[/b] As a heavy boardgame lover, I love a good challenge, and Lisboa offers me one! I find a game 10 times more rewarding when it challenges me and my friends to find the most efficient and effective path through a maze of intertwined game mechanics affecting both my play and that of my opponents. We haven't tried this out already, but it looks promising: in order to level out different levels of experience when you play with new players, a small expansion is being shipped with the game, which allows for a small advantage you can give to new players.

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) [b]Imortant, yet tiny and unclear symbols:[/b] Players are each given a small book with summarize the game rules, which aid with questions like 'how can I raise money?', 'How can I obtain influence?', etc and which explains the symbols found on cards and clergy tiles. Those symbols are a problem: they are not very intuitive to new players, they are printed on tiny clergy tiles, they are super important in order to pursue the right strategy and... there are tons of them on the table: 6 clergy tiles and 8 decree cards out each turn. This is somewhat annoying. Sometimes you just don't feel like taking out your magnifying glass in order to look for a tiny number printed on that clergy tile and looking up what that number represents in your chinese take out menu player aid - but it is really important that you do, because that tile coud be crucial to your strategy...

(-) [b]Downtime and general time investment:[/b] There are some downtown issues with Lisboa, especially with new players. A single turn can take quite a long time to finish. Especially building buildings can cause some AP in players (there are tons of things to take into account when selecting the most appropriate building spot) and some turns can take quite a while when opponents follow others. For me personally, this is not a big deal as Lisboa is filled with (positive) player interaction, and your play gets influenced by others. Even when it is not your turn, you stay involved. The game takes some time to play (expect 3 - 4 hours for your first 4-player game), but I felt involved every minute of it. I expect downtime to decrease with more experience with the game. Still, I have heard this complaint from other players and I can see why this can be a big deal for some.

(-) [b]Fortuna can bite you in the *ss:[/b] As all other titles Vital Lacerda has produced, Lisboa is a skill based game, not a luck-based one and that is a good thing to me. However, more than some of his previous titles, Lisboa has some luck-driven elements. I can not help but feel that some clergy tiles are more powerful than others and each player is dealt a random one at the beginning of the game. A major aspect of this game is getting the right combinations out, and when it comes to clergy tiles and decree cards, there is some luck of the draw involved: some tiles and cards are bound not to come out. I get the impression that the impact of such things on the end score is higher in Lisboa compared to previous Vital titles, and to me that is a disadvantage. On the other hand, randomness remains very low in Lisboa compared to other strategic games (I can be formal to say this is a skill-based game!) and it has the benefit of making the game feel more 'alive' and different each game. It is a matter of personal preference whether you see this aspect as a disadvantage or an asset.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Lisboa is one of the best games I have discovered in years. As a big fan of Lacerda's previous games, I enjoy and have a deep repect for the intertwined and elegant game mechanics integrating theme within. With Lisboa, he did a great job with this once more, and thanks to its massive historical scope, tons of opportunities for interesting player interaction and challenging complexity, this game will keep me coming back for more and has found a place in my select absolute favorite boardgame list.

This game will appeal to those who like a strategic challenge and who are willing to stay alert for tactical opportunities during the course of play, which will take 2,5 - 4 hours I expect. The game will challenge your attention span with some downtime and unclear / small iconography, but it will vastly reward players with the require tenacity to persistently find the optimal way through this thematic mechanical maze. The challenge does not come from the rule set, which is remarkably simple and elegant, but from the vast amount of strategic and tactical choices which are attached to this deceivingly simple game engine.

My main concern with Lisboa is the fact that an important aspect of this game is finding the right combination in order to pursue an effective strategy, but making those combinations relies in part on card (decree) or tile (clergy + public building) draws. However, this aspect also makes the game more vibrant and different each time you play and it is well possible that with more experience, players will find ways to cope with this limited randomness. I for one am sure to have a blast trying out tons of different strategies in future plays with this wonderful gem of a game!

[u]Tips[/u]
(*) The base scoring systems revolve around: building buildings (shops + public buildings), decree cards and shipping goods. It is well possible to persue strategies which tick 2 or 3 of those boxes

(*) You don't get that many turns in a 4-player game, so make the most of each turn. If you can, try to have enough royal favors and influence so you get the opportunity to 'follow' other players visiting nobles during their turn

(*) Since noble cards are widely available in the game, the most fool-proof way to ensure you can take some necessary actions is to have 1 or 2 goods in storage (no goods means you can not sell or trade with nobles - this might lead you to the undesirable situation in which you have to forfeit a turn just to take a gold good). However, if you play your cards right, you can get away with little goods: a combination of noble cards and enough influence allows you to take the powerful 'visit nobles' action without the need for goods. A combination of the right treasury cards with enough money also allows for some powerful tactical moves without having to spend goods. My main message is: there are tons of ways of getting things done in this game, but if you ever use up all your good tiles, make sure you have a solid strategic plan to continue playing without good tiles because you need these tiles in order to take more than half of the game actions and the other actions require influence or money!)

(*) Clergy tiles offer powerful personal abilities. Making the right combinations can boost strategies which make you a serious candidate for victory

(*) Treasury cards are all the more appealing when the royal treasury is low: at this point they are inexpensive to use, they don't allow for your opponents to 'follow' your action and some actions they provide can be very powerful. What's more: they don't cost you any influence!

(*) It can be expensive, but do try to get some shops up early in the game. Having goods at your disposal makes you less dependant on 'extra's' on cards played on your player board and the in game bonusses of getting some houses out is well worth the while. It is also one of the main scoring engines in the game.

(*) It is really interesting to try to collect easy blue (or red) rubble cubes by placing public buildings: they generally don't cost much money or good tiles, and there are the fastest way to collect rubble cubes, allowing you to increase your storage and portfolio, which is really helpful. Public buildings increase the points you get for your stores and put you in the race to score 15, 10 or 5 points for employment at the end of the game.

So simple, yet so complex.  Very straight forward mechanics with lots of depth.  You kinda pull a lever and see how things connect.  I think the game is beautifully made, the art and production are stellar.  Played at 1, 2 and 4.  Enjoyed all player counts though 4 was probably the best.  Solid solo mode as well.  Would love for this to become a regular on the table.

My favorite Vita Lacerda games so far!  You feel overwhelmed when being caught but once the game starts, things flow very smoothly.  Play a card, perform actions according to the card, get a new card, that's all you need to know.  Fun, deep, strategic,  yet simple to play.  Excellent!

i want to like this game. i want to keep this and consider it a collectable, but it just makes me feel awful when i look at it. i'm supposed to enjoy meaty designer games! it's hard enough to get any euros played lately, but this one just overwhelms. i've had the same unhappy paralytic reaction with Trickereon, but at least i wasn't alone in that experience, failing to play it with a friend. I'm glad everyone else loves the game, but i'm also a little jealous. the interwoven complexity in lieu of (and masquerading as) elegance simply rubs me the wrong way. solo mode i had to write out the ai's moves in advance because they just weren't intuitive. when that cleared things up considerably, i began writing down MY moves in advance as well, and that just didn't sit right. shall i spreadsheet my optimal moves and then just turn the crank? oh good, then i can save the spreadsheet so the next game is over more quickly? no no no. obviously my solo woes don't much count against the game played multiplayer, but of my 2-5 gaming groups none had the time. so, then, neither do i. Rating: 4 ("it doesn't get me, but could still be talked into it on occasion.")

Amazing game - pretty simple mechanics each turn with the 4 ways you can use each card (tuck and sell goods, tuck and trade goods for minor favors, place and pay influence for a minor favor and major favor, or place and pay money to get usually a major favor), but lots of options in how to integrate those options most effectively.   There's a little bit of competition over store and public building spots, and placing workers to increase the influence costs, but you rarely ever feel blocked - there's something else similarly good to do.  There's a lot of ways to get points, so it could feel point salady, but the theme really makes all the scoring options well-integrated as a whole.  The combination of clergy tokens you take and which treasury cards you tuck can really help you focus on an optimal strategy to capitalize on their special abilities.  Minor complaint is that the decree cards feel a bit samey, like they'll all get you 3-5 points depending on how they match what you've already been working on. Really looking forward to playing this one a bunch more.

RATING: 7.3
--Sep2017-- Quite attractive and with loads of attention to cool details.  Yet also the sort of thing that requires a bunch of rules-lookups to play (even remotely cleanly) the first time out.
I did a bit worse than that: mixing up the way the actions triggered on more than one occasion.  And yet it wasn't that the explanation didn't work; more that it didn't quite stick, even with reinforcement.
Still, it was intriguing in its business; I'd be totally happy to play again (which is more enthusiastic, for the record, than I was for _The Gallerist_.)

Without question, a masterwork by designer Vital Lacerda. Delivered with topnotch components to do justice to the magnificence of the design. And a great history lesson to boot (with cards that note the historical highlights of the rebuilding of Lisbon in the 18th century). And Ian O'Toole's amazing artwork is the icing on the cake. A must have for anyone who likes crunchier games.

RATING: 9
Another home run for Vital Lacerda. The historical theme is fascinating and comes through nicely with game play. 

In Lisboa you have to do a bit of everything to be competitive. The winner is mostly determined by well-timed actions, rather than any specialized strategy.

Just too dang many things going on. And that's exacerbated by the atrocious art direction and iconography. It took many turns before I could see how things started to click together. And that's fine, except even toward the end we were screwing up exactly what going here meant, or what doing this would accomplish. And as I said, those icons don't help. I liked it. I would play again. I would only play with the same people (or people who already know how to play). It took us 4 and 1/2 hours with rules. If we could get that down to 2 or 2 and 1/2 hours, I might be interested in playing more. But as it is, I don't know why I'd play this over Argent: The Consortium.

Vital Lacerda's best game to date. Despite looking a lot like a deck of Bicycle playing cards threw-up all over itself. The bright primary colours on a harsh white background certainly is different.

This is a big, heavy game, with a big, thick rule book, one that tells the story of Lisbon during one of the biggest crises in history, while explaining how the game works. Theme permeates every facet of it. From the trading of church influence to the clearing of rubble every aspect of the game has a thematic reason behind it. As daunting as the rules seem, the game plays quite elegantly.

[url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/217189/item/5031588]1 partial play[/url]. There was some sloooow play (sort of like I remember during my first games of Kanban and Gallerist!). We quit just after getting into 2nd period.

The game is pretty complicated, with a lot of interweaving steps. According to the designer, this is one of his lighter games -- I just didn't see it on this first play, at least partially because I didn't find the board design or game iconography especially intuitive Some WORDS on the board and cards would have been nice! 

I think I might enjoy the game, but I'm hoping the final version has better symbology (I know words are too much to hope for). I will NOT, however, play this with more than 2-3 total players if there are any newbies playing!

RATING: 5.5
I had read great things about Lisboa's amazing thematic integration, to which I can only say: you are high as a kite. OK, OK, that might not be fair; there are thematic justifications for every element (Vital Lacerda has mentioned, for example, the historical basis for the decree cards). But like most of his designs, it falls into what I think of as the What's Your Game? school: Stefan Feld turned up to 11, a complex spreadsheet where every action impacts 15 other cells, less like four-dimensional chess than four-dimensional accountancy.

The included "player aid" is literally an eight-page mini-rulebook.

Where to start? Players are rebuilding Lisboa after its near total destruction in 1755 by taking various actions, the specifics of which are neither interesting nor important. There are also more than half a dozen supporting actions which can be taken in combination with the "main" actions -- players generally take between two and three total actions per turn.

Some are about setting up later actions: public buildings have several dependencies to place, for example; other actions require money, goods or influence. It's possible to "follow" three of the main actions, Puerto Rico style, if appropriate favour tiles have been acquired. There are also different kinds of ongoing bonus, the synergies of which are important: various reviewers have called it a game of building a successful combo and hammering it to victory. (I'm not so sure of this, personally: with limited experience, Lisboa seems much, much more tactical than I had expected; values of actions change [i]drastically[/i] based on opportunities opened or closed by other players, and unlike e.g. Kanban there are fewer constraints on action order and so it's harder to predict what opponents will do and plan around it.)

Interplay variability derives from the large number of random elements, such as available scoring cards and bonuses on treasury and clergy tiles. Luck certainly does have some impact here (having synergies fall into your lap is helpful) but it's hard to quantify. 

EGG's ridiculously luxurious production, with gorgeous artwork by Ian O'Toole, is stunning to look at. It is not stunningly usable, especially the ornate icons which are blobby and difficult to distinguish from a distance. Most icons are conceptually rather than mechanically representative, e.g. the icon for taking a decree is a complicated thing with a star and a wax seal and the icon for taking a plan is paper and a quill pen; players just have to memorize them. On a similar note, the player aid includes references for the unique, numbered cards and tiles, but the the numbers are too small to even see from across the table, let alone read.

This stuff is likely to fade into the background with experience, of course, which helps contribute to my feeling that Lisboa is the kind of game which needs to be played often to be playable at all. It doesn't help that with inexperienced players it's much too long, particularly for the kind of point-salad that it is. I haven't really liked a Lacerda game since CO2 and this one is no exception, so I don't imagine I will ever get that sort of familiarity.

RATING: 8
Played once with 3.  Amazing first impression.  This is a beast of a game, but it has a rhythm that just works to make it all feel really manageable to me. Once you get used to the iconography, everything that you do is laid out on the board or on cards somewhere.  And I really like the art design, for the most part.  It has incredible strategic depth, and you have a vast array of possible choices every turn.

The only problem I have with this game is that it runs long.  Our play with 3 took 3 hours.  I see that coming down with more play, but it's a longer game.  It has to be one of the only long, heavy games that I've felt was worth every second, though.  I'd guess my rating will go up on more plays, which I intend to get in right away.

Lisboa is the game that I had hoped The Gallerist would be, and more. It's mind-numbingly difficult to grasp at first, but half-way through a session the pieces start to fall into place and it is an amazing experience.

Oddly enough, for so many decision-trees offered in the game, AP doesn't really rear it's ugly head. Setup will require quite a bit of time, as will teaching to others.

Not just a board game, it's a glorious work of art.

Genius.  Absolutely genius.  Lacerda proves that he deserves a mention among the best designers of the Golden Age of boardgaming.

Oh yeah, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention how stunningly beautiful this game is.  

It's already ascended to my #2 Lacerda game (and Kanban is in my top 5 favorite games of all time).

More commentary to come after I get more plays under my belt.  I've played enough to understand how brilliant this game is.  Now it's time to see if it is versatile enough to maintain a rarely awarded 9/10.

tl;dr: solid deign, but where's the fun?

[thing=42052][/thing] is a game from [person=12396][/person] that I quite enjoy, but it's also complex, heavy and feels a lot like work. This game seems to continue further in that direction. It feels even more like work. Maybe that's because this was only my first play though. But yeah, this game has a lot of mechanisms and it takes a good while before you start having an idea of how things interact and how to archive things. This game has a player aid that actually is an 8 page leaflet! And it doesn't even include things like end game scoring!
Yeah, this is definitely one of those games where the designer and developers didn't bother finding ways to streamline it a bit while retaining the depth. Now, don't get me wrong. This is a solid design. It is clearly well thought out. But I found it lacking in the fun department.
A word on production: the artwork is ugly and the board is too busy. Especially the part where you build the tiles. And it seems like the publisher actively looked for ways to include more pieces to jack up the price needlessly. I would put this in the 'overproduced' box.

A lot of ideas lifted out of The Gallerist and reimagined in more sensical, structured ways. Following with favors is a marked improvement on kicked-out actions. Following requires deliberate planning, whereas kicked-out actions in The Gallerist often happen out of circumstance; the semi-co-op part of the game is now required rather than optional, even at 2p.

This game is a sophisticated Swiss watch of mechanics working together seamlessly. Nothing in this game is extraneous. The theme is tightly integrated, and with four players who know the game, it hums along in well under two hours. 

When I want to break out a heavy Euro, this is the one I take off the shelf.

Lacerda's best game.

I'm a huge Vital Lacerda fanboi and this was the one game I had definitely scheduled for Lobster Trap.  I was excited to get a play in.  Despite watching a rules explanation, I struggled trying to wrap my head around this game.  (I also found the iconography to be unintuitive).  Even though this game broke my head, I really enjoyed it.

At the heart of the game, you just play one card for your action, and draw a replacement.  That's all.  Well, except for all the other stuff that happens.

So there's two ways to play the card to your player board and one way to play to the main board.  If you play to your player board, you're either tucking it in the top or on the bottom.  Either way gives you a bonus thing shown on the card.  If you play the card to the top, then it counts as influence when you ship goods and "run" your board.  If you play it to the bottom, then it gives you some special ability.  Either way, you then either spend goods to ship to someone's ship (preferably your own) or spend goods to trigger two bonus actions (more on those later).

Alternatively, if you play a card to the main board, then you do a bonus action in either the green, blue or red area (depending on the card you played) and then that main action.  The bonus action you do doesn't cost a good here, but instead you must pay influence for all the meeples of other colors in that area.  These actions can be followed by players with the matching color bonus chit (but they only get to do 1 thing, either the bonus thing or the main action) unless you play a different type of card (which requires you to spend money instead of influence).

So the bonus actions let you do things like put out meepeles (which will cost other players influence to do actions and also are required for contracts), take a contract (required for building public works), build a ship using goods (which give points at game end and are a way to trade goods for money and points), "run" your buildings and produce the appropriate goods, move on the clergy track and take a bonus tile which gives you some nifty thing or power, get a royal decree (which lets you follow other people's actions).

The main actions are build a building, take a scoring card or build a public work.  Building a building costs money according to how many damage cubes are in the intersection right and down of the building you want to build.  You get to first pull a cube off one of those spots (which helps you as you're trying to collect sets of each of the three colors).  Then you get the bonus thing for that spot.  And if there's a public work in the row or column that matches the building color you get points (or if that's built later you still get the points).

When you ship goods, you send goods to a ship, getting the current value for that good in cash.  Those spots on the ship cannot be used until that player's next turn.  On their turn, they remove the goods for a point each.  Ideally you'd ship to your own ship, but you might not have space, or another player's ship might have a money bonus, etc.  When you produce goods by running your buildings, the goods your produce drop in value on the market chart (permanently).

If you get a set of red (fire), white (earthquake) and blue (flood) damage then it does a couple of things.  First it's points at game end.  Second each set increases how many cards you can have tucked into your player board.  And finally it puts one of your player color cubes in the center of the board which you can spend when taking a scoring card to take a second scoring card.

Scoring cards either just give you points, points contingent on how many x have happened, or points if you have the most y.  You can spend one of your "cleared damage" player color cubes to take a second scoring card.

Building a public work requires having a contract (either blue or green) which allows you to build the next building in the matching pile.  You must discard that many meeples from the appropriate area, and then you put the tile on a public works spot around the board, taking the bonus thing there and the damage cubes on that spot.  The public work scores points for buildings on the matching color street (or colors if there's more than one) that intersects with the row/column your public work is on.

When any player removes two columns of damage cubes, that triggers the mid game.  Players can discard cards to get replacements from the new (and better) deck.  If they discard noble cards, they can get the benefit of one noble of each color.  Removing four columns of damage cubes triggers the end of the game.  You finish out the round and everyone gets one more action.

There's a lot to think about in the game.  It completely broke my head.  I definitely need more plays to figure out how to play well.  But I'm eager to play this gain.  Unfortunately, I don't know that many people who'd be up for it.

Fabulous game. In the heavy euro yet accessible and pleasurable to play category, this game has no contenders. The lacerdan "four actions opening on more" works marvelously here. In a more convincing way than The Gallerist I think. The theme, more than mere art, is literally dripping from every mechanic. As for the art, it is by far the best art I've ever been able to see in a board game. Finally, the solo is excellent, making you play against an actual opponent that will score at the end of the game, giving you the classical "euro game stress" of not knowing who is winning or will most likely win. It is rare enough for an euro game to have a real solo that it makes it worth mentionning!
The level of variability of each set up is also a huge quality of this game. Non variable sand-box suffering of lack of replayability; this won't happen with Lisboa.

Economic and political city builder euro of nobles vying for prestige in the rebuilding of the Portugese city devastated in the historical 1755 earthquake.  Conduct shipping trade at your port and then play a single multi purpose action card to grow the family warehouse and shipping business or go to the royal court and spend influence for favorable decrees, grease the bureaucracy or obtain permits with the state departments... Or just bribe the bastards with warehouse goods.  Each action can potentially cause a chain reaction of commerce, influence, prestige, upgrades, and resource development.  And, all this must be done while managing the constraints and limitations cleaning up and repairing the city infrastructure damaged from earthquake, floods, and fires.  Vital does such a great job at imagining and integrating so many related and thematic elements into a cohesive game play experience. He is the Spinal Tap of game design. Always finding a way to go to 11 for that extra push.

We played a demo with the designer , rules editor and the owner of the publishing company and got it signed by the designer! It's a heavy euro game with lots of interesting components and a nice flow. Can't wait to play it again!

I was worried this game was going to have too much going on, and feel confusing with how busy seeming the board is. I love Licerda's previous games, The Gallerist and Kanban, but especially with Kanban, the board is glaringly overwhelming. Once it was on the table, the art work looks AMAZING, and incredibly detail oriented, and the actual game play is addicting. Game play is more simple than it seams, however there are a lot of different things that can happen on your turn, and a lot of different icons. Luckily there's a great reference sheet  that helps tremendously, though some people may be put off by the constant need to reference it. Overall though, I am really enjoying this, and so happy I backed it on Kickstarter

Very heavy euro, excellent blend of mechanics and theme.  The history is a huge plus.  The interconnected-ness of the mechanics and game economy is simply riveting. This is vying for my favorite heavy euro.

Heavy beast! Lots of moving parts, it´s is difficult to see the combos at first, also it feels like a meehh!! game the first couple o plays, but trust me once you get the hang of it you see the beauty and interconection and everything seems like it fIts, it feels very balanced.

Another pro is that every play count works and feels very different in play style. AWESOME GAME!!!

My first play of a Vital Lacerda game and the way everything is interconnected is so clever. Whilst I admire the design it might be just a tad too heavy for me. Still, turns really do come down to making one decision about which of 4 actions you want to take. But that decision requires so much careful planning and thinking of how to pull off the various levers to execute the action that it creates some fantastic brain burn. I'm still keen to play again and I could see the rating rise to a 9.

[b]1p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] It's a fair amount of setup for a solitaire game, but then it really pays off. Lacerda is sufficiently predictable if you pay attention, but as with human players, sometimes your moves "change his mind", which can really surprise you if you're not careful. Great fun! Just fantastic!

[b]3p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] Yes.

[b]4p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] Yum, yum, yum.

Nagyon szép játék, kifejezetten tetszett a megjelenése, még a furcsa arcok láttán sem rettentem el. Ami ennél viszont sokkal fontosabb, hogy jó is a játék, egy elég komplex euro, így elsőre elég komoly játékidővel kell számolnunk. 4-esben talán túl sokkal is, némi ap-vel megspékelve, így készüljünk fel egy jó 3 órás menetre (+szabálymagyarázat). Ha ezen túl vagyunk és még mindig tetszik a játék, akkor a következő alkalommal már nagy valószínűséggel még jobban összeállnak a dolgok mint az első alkalommal, helyére kerülnek a miértek és értelmet nyernek az akciók... ahogy az a többi Lacerda-játéknál már megszokott, itt is szuper a tanulási görbe. Ha azok tetszettek, nagy valószínűséggel ez is fog, apró nüanszok dönthetnek majd egyik vagy másik játék javára.

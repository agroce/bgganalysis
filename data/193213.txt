I enjoyed my 5 player game of it. However, I agree with others that the negotiation aspect fell a bit flat as there wasn't much of an incentive to negotiate with others unless your role showed up twice.

Vraiment intéressant. Rôles cachés (mais choisi), Négociation et Pousse-ta-Chance, tout dans le même jeu.

C'est vraiment bon et offre plein de puzzle à décortiquer, de gens à enfirouaper et d'argent à gagner.

Pretty interesting game, the roles are a bit random and definitely luck involved.  Will probably be better with more people.  It's quite a good laugh though.

Move over Resistance. This one has more structure to it and can be played and understood more easilly, and is just as fun, if not more.

We laugh a lot more with it than Resistance. It's just a better game in all respects...

never truly got the grasp of this game, seems like we are just doing math for each heist. But when someone pulls out a bluff and gained money it's still pretty sick

Fun negotiating game where the heart of the gameplay is in the negotiating itself.  Game definitely needs the right people to play it and feels limited at lower player counts.  This game feels like 7 would be the right number to get the most of this game.

Doesn't really work at least with 8 players. Fun in the sense of "we're all strewd all the time", but so much otherwise.

Hidden role negotiation game that plays quite differently with different number of players. With more people it seemed more random. 4 people played better.

RATING: N/A
I won't rate this yet as I've only played it for an hour or so (as 5-player).

My first impression is that it's a lovely 'clean' bluffing game - but one where there's often too little information, so players resort to guesswork and simple odds. It belies the promise of exciting negotiation, which sometimes happens but often seemed empty.

I'd play it ahead of, say, Coup but not ahead of One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

In structure and length it is similar to the excellent The Resistance: Avalon, but I'd play that game over Millions of Dollars every time. In Millions of Dollars you're often meandering in the dark, whereas in TR:A the sytem forces information out of players.

RATING: 6
It was an ok game of negotiation and bluffing, but needs everyone to be on board with it or it falls flat.

RATING: 7
Deduction game ... but a weaker one compared to "The Resistance" or "One Night Ultimate Werewolf". Here you send clan members to rob banks. Gorgeous artwork on the cards. Gameplay seemed a bit awkward. Nevertheless worth to trying it out.

I own a lot of social deduction games and this is definitely one of the more unique ones. Between all of the different role interactions, you would think that there would be a lot to analyze and discuss during the negotiation phase but I have found that it frequently falls silent. Perhaps the game doesn't incentivize lying about your role and trying to get paid to leave enough? The paper money components are also pretty mediocre. Might start using poker chips instead.

The game has a similar feel to Coup because you can lie about your role, but there is negotiation added in where you try to pay off other players to knock them out of the round, hoping to gain more money for yourself.

Unlike Coup, however, this game sucks. The negotiation is really uninteresting because you have very little to work with. If you think the other person is telling the truth, then you just calculate the best amount to pay them off.

If a single person has the face-down role, then they have a huge advantage for that round because they have perfect information and everyone else is guessing. This won't happen too often, but it does happen.

If this game came out years ago it may have stood out a little bit and warranted a few plays. In today's glut of similar games this one just doesn't cut it.

Sold.

Negotiation and deduction party card game.  Crime gangs send in a hidden role for a job. Duplicate roles are eliminated. Players try to buyout other shares of the loot.  One role is unrevealed adds an unknown to your deal making and finally, unique special abilities of the mastermind, driver, snitch, and thug make the whole dynamic even more juicy to make off with the cash. A thinky negotiation game, may not be suited for casual play or muggles.

Takes a few rounds to get into it, and this game is not for everybody, but I loved it! Great bluffing, deduction, and playing chicken. 
(one idea: maybe the heists could have given higher rewards? Now it seems there isn't a lot of room to send players away)

My favorite hidden identity, and negotiation-based party game ever! I love mind games, bluffing, double-bluffing, and reading my opponents, and this game delivers all those aspects in spades. This is one hell of a game, with a great theme. It inspires players to roleplay, and is highly engaging.

Sadly it is worse with fewer than six players, as you start removing roles, and this very much lessens the experience, even though I understand why they've done so.

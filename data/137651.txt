I enjoy the game.  So far, I cannot get close to finishing both the doomsday machine and the getaway vehicle - need to get a lot more efficient.  Not an easy game to sleeve, if you're into that.  Great customer service for me on a small issue.

The game is not complex to understand, just the rules of what resources are required to build your machine at the end of the game.  This is a very tense game right to the end, as you are constantly trying to figure out how to do everything that you need to do in a turn.

This game is TIGHT! It is a good thing that this game is easy to learn because if you missed a few things during explanation it could cost you the game. You really have to pay attention to what you need and what other people are inventing. I enjoy this game a lot but it is definitely a brain burner. It plays just about as long as the box says, 30 minutes per player. The theme could probably be anything, but it's fun anyway.

   Perhaps one of the more innovative themes out there, I didn't find it difficult to immerse myself in this one; however, the threat of completing the game with few (if any) points for the smallest over-sight is enough to prevent me from praising it.

Worker placement without farming or trains.  Fun theme, attractive artwork, and fun gameplay.

Each player takes the role of a mad scientist living in Victorian London trying to build their doomsday machine and escape plan.  Workers collect and process raw materials, make money, and spend time working in the lab.

The biggest challenge in the game is managing the time needed to actually build the devices necessary to win in the turn limit.  There is very little room for sub-optimal play.

Great game. Very intense and hard on the brain. Almost no down-time at all as you need to be constantly planning. Played it with 6 and took us more than 4 hrs, but well worth the effort. Nice design, a bit hard to read with many people around one table. Color scheme not ideal, but playable. Theme fun, although too busy to fully appreciate it. Great replay value, as many different machines and inventions and ... and lots to learn and improve!
Not sure how it would play second time round with a mixed groups of newbies and old hats. My guess is the professionals would have too much of an advantage at the start, unless some tricks would be revealed to all.
Make sure all players fully understand the victory conditions as we had some disappointments in the end.

Players use their Doctors and three henchmen to acquire resources at the available shops, acquire gold, visit the black markets, provide the "Genius at Work" labor (GAW), provide "Manual Labor" (ML), improve the Doctor's social standing, and invent things. You must complete both a Doomsday Machine and an Escape Plan, with higher level Doomsday Machines and Escape Plans garnering more victory points, and you need to do it quickly. Scotland Yard is getting suspicious, after all, so you have to do what you need to do in 15 turns. Players can earn additional victory points for fitting in with society, eccentricity, security and inventions.

This is a really tight worker placement game. Lots of stuff to do, but not nearly enough time to do it in. Multiple ways to get VPs, and you can switch tactics based on the game flow.
This game is on the trade pile because I've got a lot of worker/placement and/or engine builders - and it happens to be the one I like the least (which is not to say it's a bad game).

Has all the hallmarks of an under-developed Kickstarter game.   It's far too long for what it does.   The 15th turn is just like the 1st.  The game has no arc to it, as you are literally doing the same thing for 15 rounds, each with 4 workers.   Gather resources, convert resources, and advance up tracks for points.   I will gave the game props for the Doomsday Devices and Escape Plans, which are essentially 3-tiered shopping lists that you need to complete by the end of the game.  The theme is there, and the game is funny in places.   Graphic design and board layout are terrible:  icons are way too small in places, and cards are way too big in others.   It shows that more experienced eyes looking at pre-production copies would have helped.   And then there's the fact that game shipped without the wooden bits....  ahem....  hard to believe, but true.   So, all in all, I like the concept and I had fun playing it with good people, but the game feels half-baked to me.  (see also: Alien Frontiers, Ground Floor, etc.)

This is a bland and rather taxing worker-placement almost solely about grabbing resources to build stuff for VP. Resources are tight, there's little you can do to generate ongoing advantage (the extra inventions are very expensive) and the game is too long for what little novelty it contains.

The elimination (you must build at least Stage I of your two projects or lose the game) and the Caylus-style delayed activation are nice and the components pretty good though.

Special spaces on the right seem to be superflous and not integrated into the game well.  Different getaway vehicles and doomsday devices don't seem all that different after an initial play.  Cards that come out are basically the same thing over and over again too.  I really wanted to like this game.  Production quality was nice though and I actually liked the cards but maybe bits that flip like in Le Havre are more efficient and easier to use.

One of the least satisfying WP games I've ever played. The mechanics are very basic with nothing that really stands out as unique and original within the gameplay. What killed it for me was the multi-tier nature of the scoring opportunities. I had completed all of the lower level objectives and had the game in the bag after working hard at completing everything I needed to... when I lost in the end because I miscounted and was missing ONE item needed on the lower level of my objective, losing my score not only for the higher point tier, but also the lower! It felt like the equivalent of working hard on an exam to get a 0% because you forgot to put your name on the test.

In my first game, there was never a point where I wasn't enjoying myself, but once it was over it seemed like it was too long for what it is.

You have four workers and the game lasts fifteen turns. That means that with six players you're gonna have a whopping 360 worker placement actions. I don't fancy playing this with more than four players after going through it once with six. It was fun, but somehow the early game feels a bit meaningless and it sort of felt like you just have to be going somewhat to the right direction: just keep on getting resources and invent a bit here and there. Only during the last five or so turns you had to be clear on what you needed for the endgame and there never was too cruel competition for anything, it seemed to me. Neat production values and a nice adaptation of Caylus' system of fixed order of resolving actions.

There are worker placement games I like, but I think this game mechanism needs to take a rest. WHBIT is pretty much just a straight WP game and not much else. Each turn you deploy four workers, one of which is different, and then you collect the stuff you get, which eventually scores you points. Repeat for fifteen long turns. There's just nothing here that you haven't already seen hundreds of times before and no reason to choose this over any number of similar games. Worker placement is also becoming tiresome because it's now what counts as interaction in these games, and is the only such interaction. If you're new to boardgaming, this is what it was like ten years ago, only everything was an auction. Add some annoying design issues (teeny tiny icons, wall-of-text cards, constant fiddling with cards on the boards, etc) and it really fails to justify its existence.

Game is decent.  The theme is good, but feels like implementation could have been better, as it gets repetitive, tedious and overstays its welcome IMHO.  I would have preferred this game to go 10 rounds instead of 15.  Was not expecting a 4 player game to take 3 hours.  Also reading the cards upside down was a pain.  I don't know why it was more apparent in this game than some others, but it was.

This game is going to require several plays to figure out what everything does. There's 17 board spaces to place one's four workers on (two different kinds of workers) and random cards make several spaces change effects each round. Then there are the invention cards, seven of those plus the bright idea cards. The inventions require different combinations of resources, depending on whether you are the first to invent or not. Then the escape plans have two parts (vehicle and weapon) and each of those has three levels with different requirements. My first play was just overwhelming, but I'm looking forward to trying again.

The most basic of worker placement paired with an artificial sense of resource scarcity. Each round plays out the same as players collect a smattering of junk, none of which is terribly important. This game feels like they haphazardly tweaked a bunch of mundane actions until something that resembled a game was created. There are many games that are much better in this category.

RATING: 3
I'm afraid this left me completely cold.  The engine-building mechanics are sound, but this feels far too self-involved for a multi-player experience.  As you are involved in making your own projects, and nobody has any idea what you're building, it feels like there is very little in the way of specific strategies to counter each build.  You can get in the way of each other on the worker placement board, sure, but it feels more like getting to the front of the queue at the hardware store, rather than any concerted, specific strategy or counter-strategy against the other players.  In many respects, the theme is spot on - it genuinely feels like you're in your garage, tinkering away without caring about the world outside, rather than a social experience with your friends.

I'd rather play a game with a technology-building mechanic like this, that has some sort of shared environment for your inventions to compete on afterwards - prime examples include ship upgrades in Eclipse, or even the simplified technology-grabbing in Ticket to Ride: United Kingdom.  As such, I would not play this again.

RATING: 5
Have only played this once, but I found it to be a nice worker placement game. It creates a nice rhythm in how you have to lay out your plan in the current and subsequent periods in order to achieve your goals, which plays in nicely to the theme of making you think you are building a evil experiment and an escape plan. I enjoy that multi-period execution of your plan in a game.

You probably won't like this game if you enjoy chatting all game long. That isn't to say there is not talking as you will have to harass other players as they take your needed worker placement spots, but you have to be able to adjust on the fly and formulate new plans when your current options have been blocked.

I look forward to playing this again soon.

So-so worker placement game. The theme might be useful for introducing someone to worker-placement if you can't convince them to get excited about farming, but it lacks the depth of something like Agricola.

I found the game a little burdensome - constantly having to refer to very small graphic icons to work out how much stuff was needed to invent stuff which was needed to invent other stuff. Game could probably be vastly improved though the use of some decent player aids. Cards for resources is very fiddly and time consuming - I can't understand why cubes weren't used. Custom pieces would be even better but would add too much to the cost of course. Interesting game - I wouldn't mind trying it again but maybe not for a while.

This game really attracted me to it with its theme.  Playing a mad scientist building a Doomsday machine sounded like a lot of fun.  However the game ended up being incredibly bland for the exciting theme.

I will go on to say that doesn't mean the theme is pasted on.  The theme makes a lot of sense.  You need to collect materials and spend hours of labor putting together these evil inventions.  If another scientist has already invented an item you need for your own machine you can simply pay them for one instead of spending the hours to build it yourself.  There are also some activities only you, the mad scientist, can perform and others you would only send your lackey henchmen to complete.  There is even a track for blending into society to throw the authorities off your scent.

That's what attracted me to this game.  The great theme and the integration with the game mechanics.  It's also a worker placement game and I enjoy worker placement quite a bit.  However, like I said, the game is so bland.  I think I was hoping for these inventions to give you certain special powers or for the different spaces you go to, which change each round, to do different interesting things.  Instead every action is either collecting materials or getting more points.  Over and over again you just collect more materials and try to get more points than your opponents.  In the end a very boring game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
Good concept, however there are some rough spots in the execution. I dislike the use of small cards for resources. Tokens or normal sized cards would have been good. The cards are busy and the icons on them need to be larger such that its easier to see them from the far end of the board in a 5 or 6 player game. It seems that the game could use a few less resources as a whole 6 raw and 6 refined seems to make buying the Direct Effect work against you instead of for you. Why waste precious resources for your Escape Plan and Main Invention on a few measly victory points.

Willing to play further rounds but will likely have to do it with a different gaming group as BSJP, indicated that they would not come back to it.

I played this game late Friday at Gen Con 2013.  We had 6 people trying it out and had to review the rules before playing. The game mechanics are simple, but gameplay is not.  There is a lot to do every game round and your are competing for worker placement every round.  You have to keep all your ducks in a row or you will get screwed at the end of turn 15. My friend and I that played this game at Gen Con were brain fried afterward.  It was intense with people.

Pros:
Moves fast.
Lots of times around the board (15 rounds, 4 character placements each round = 60 times around the table).
Fun Theme - you are each a mad scientist building a doomsday device and an escape vehicle.
It took a long time, but was engaging the whole time.  I only played once, but would expect that if you play with experienced players it could play in 90 minutes.

Cons:
Beware of analysis paralysis - there are so many things to look out for that if someone has to weigh out each option every time, you could be waiting a while.  Remember everyone has 60 turns in the 15 rounds, so you'll want to keep it moving.

Iconography could be more distinctive.  Worst offender is that the raw steel is stacked and looks like it should be raw wood.  The raw materials are on square backgrounds with rounded corners.  Whereas refined materials have circular backgrounds.  The colors are all sort of muted.  It would be helpful if the icons and colors were more dynamic.

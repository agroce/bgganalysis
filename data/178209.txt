GAME: Adventure Time Fluxx
RANK: 4342
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fluxx was one of my "gateway games" and I'm still a big fan. The randomness doesn't bother me and it's a very "go with the flow" low strategy card game. The themes really sell it. The only thing I don't enjoy is how long and drawn out some games can get.

It's Fluxx, but Adventure Time styled.

RATING: 8.1
I'm on a quest to buy all the Adventure Time tabletop games I can find, and so it was only natural to pick up the Fluxx version, and I prefer themes like this with the system, rather than the generic topical decks. This one is pretty cool, I like it a little more than Regular Show but also wouldn't mind mashing them up.

I'm not opposed to Fluxx, but this is the only meaningful contact I've had with Adventure Time.  Unlikely to see many plays.

If you're not familiar with Fluxx its a light-hearted fast-paced deck-building/drafting game.  The change of "goal" mechanic really just boils down to "make THIS pair" and most of the time and the licensing doesn't affect the gameplay at all, just the names on the cards.  Still an amusing quick hitter to spend a few minutes having fun, used occasionally as a time filler between heavyweight strategies.

I like Adventure Time Fluxx. I suppose one of the most important things about a game, for me, has to be the theme of a game; the mechanism is important too but, the theme sometimes is just what makes any game a game I would play! :)

Much the same as common or garden Fluxx. I don't know the source material at all so that probably doesn't help, but then I really don't like Fluxx anyway.

The rules can become a bit too messy for my taste.
They usually reset quite quick though.

This Fluxx has the longest "plays" I've encountered in a Fluxx game. 

We've played several games where the game was often finished after only 2 rounds.  But each round lasted +20 mins because every player was an unending supply of cards.  

Dont get attached to your keepers with this version.

I just don't understand why people like fluxx. Very boring. No strategy. (Which isn't always a bad thing, but... in this case. it doesn't work.)

Filler game with constantly changing rules.  More annoying than fun at times, it's just a goofy filler game that uses a good amount of table space.

RATING: N/A
I'm sure I'm not the only person to buy these Fluxx games solely on the basis of theme (& cost). It's far too random, to the point where any strategy is pointless. A couple of plays with boys, who were initially excited at the characters on the cards, but no desire to play again.

Fun game with crazy changing rules, featuring some of my favorite cartoon characters. Some games last 5 minutes, others last an hour. Really a blast to play.

I keep this one in the car tucked into a side pocket. It's compact and nice to play at a coffee shop or restaurant occasionally, and I don't miss it from our at-some collection. We also don't mind cutting a game short to put it away. 

We added the Adventure Time Keepers (with no special abilities) from Cartoon Network Fluxx and it speeds the games up a bit and makes it a bit less frustrating to play.

The theme is fun, the art is colourful, but it's still just Fluxx.  Not a terrible filler, but if it goes beyond 20 minutes, it just needs to end.

Yes, its Fluxx which a lot of people don't like. And, while it lacks tons of strategy but it is nice game to play at the beginning or while waiting for other people to arrive for game night

Gets an extra point over the other versions of Overrated Non-Game I've played because it has new, original Adventure Time artwork and some funny cards. Might even keep it for that reason alone. But it is otherwise still the same, random, non-strategic, fairly bad Fluxx.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As with other Fluxx games, the game is fairly unpredictable and is very luck reliant. I would not play this expecting to match my skills against other card players. However, it's a fine party game, and the many themes mean you can always find a deck that satisfies everyone at the table.

Not for me, but can usually have my arm twisted in a party environment.

One of the shorter Fluxx games with lots of ways to win and move around cards. More fun with people who have seen the show, I imagine....

Good implementation of Adventure Time into the Fluxx card game system. Just like the show the game gets out of hand and is quite hectic fast.

Completely random. 
Takes no longer than ten minutes a game, so it's a good filler if anyone needs to step away for a couple of minutes.

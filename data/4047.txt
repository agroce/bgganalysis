Five battles of ACW.
Simply brilliant! In my opinion the best game of ACW at brigade size. The system activations of units and combat mirrors well the frustrations of command during the Civil War. 
The CRT it's Breathtaking!
Command Chit pull system; very, very, very solo friendly!

GREAT!
Playing time can vary from Bull Run 1:30-2:00 to three days of Gettysburg +7 hours.

If this game were made today, sadly, it would be released as 5 separate games in order to maximize profit.  Fortunately, we got this game when we did.

The mechanics are interesting.  It is a chit pull that reminds me of the Glory games by Richard Berg.  However, you can only combat when your sides combat chit is drawn and then every unit adjacent to an enemy melees or retreats a hex.  I understand the problem with the friction of war, but retreating a hex seems odd.  For instance, if you are holding the high ground or otherwise had the terrain, why would you not defend?

It seems like it could use a house rule with that and maybe one with the combat chit, involving having the option of throwing the chit back in on a die roll of 1-5 (or something like that), and then each time it is drawn, it can be thrown back for a less range.  I don't know: I'm spitballing.

My understanding is that some scenarios are better than others.  I played Bull Run and enjoyed it.  I will update as I tinker more with the game and try more scenarios.  As it stands, I don't regret getting it.

Simple rules but with enough flair. Standard action rules and additional rules/restrictions for each scenario. The chit-pull system keeps the game random with each play.  Fairly balanced and straightforward.
However, there are a few battles where the Confederacy is doomed seemingly no matter what!

RATING: 4
This was great value for money, 5 battles in one box including Gettysburg!
The activation chit concept to move individual divisions/corps was good and the variable time at which combat takes place. However because you have to attack if adjacent you find that a lot of the time the actual 'combat' just consists of a retreat by the attacker. 

Just couldn't put up with the 'broken' combat system and ebayed this away.

Note to self, to consider if needed, 1) "One fix ... is not to permit any units to enter enemy ZOCs in the same turn once the Attack chit has been pulled"; 2) "There is also the neat mechanic that you can call the combat phase at any point in the turn - but only once." 3) same as #2 with my own idea, only the first player to call the combat phase can do so; whoever is 2nd must put his/her combat chip in the cup and await fate.  Historical Note:  according to the History Detectives show on Shiloh, during the night the Union ships actually banked (bounced/deflected) their shell shots against the river ravine bluff, extending their range so they fell like mortars into the woods where many Rebels were camped. Also they said the Rebel soldiers were suffering from malnutrition (pork alone isn't enough), and that many Rebels were armed only with short range buck shot; the Union fired "buck and ball" (two buck shots rammed in with one musket ball)--far more accurate and effective at longer range. Finally one famous Union dramatic stand at the battle (I forget the location; first day) they found (or claim) to be unfounded by the archeology (lack of musket debris), and accounted to post-war publicity by the Corp survivors.

Randomness of turn sequence can be very tense and fun.  Problem happens when one player pulls the perfect sequence of chits early in the game or pulls the worst sequence of chits.  This seems to happen more often than expect when playing the scenarios with few counters.  Can't whole heartedly recommend as a must have game.  Played Bull Run and Bentonville.

Fun collection of scenarios with interactive turns using the now-familiar chit pull activation system.  Great game to get budding wargamers into the Civil War.  Each game unfolds in a different way due to the activation system, so replay value is generally a bit higher than usual, especially for the smaller scenarios with fewer units.  Plus, it's one of the few simulations of the Battle of Bentonville in 1865!

Fantastic game; rules are fairly straightforward but there's ample scope to replay each game due to built in variability in activation.  Played exclusively solitaire, for which it is well suited.  I played each of the games multiple times (Gettysburg only twice though).  Gettysburg takes longer than I really have time for normally, but it is still was fun and gave some nice insights into history.

This is the VERY first chit pull game I have played. Scenarios range from short and simple (First Bull Run, Pea Ridge and Bentonville) to medium (Shiloh) and Large (Gettysburg). There has been a discussion about this system not working well with the larger scenarios. My personal experience with Gettysburg was a first day nailbiter which went to the last turn. A final turn assault by three Rebel brigades on the summit of Cemetery hill which failed in the fading light. An exhausted Union army held the ridge in the end. I will play this again soon.

RATING: 6
Easy to learn and fast playing, but not a classic. I find the ZOC rules to be too ridge, leading to battles of encirclement. The combat chit is a good idea that leads to gamey situations. Worst of all, only the big scenarios work. The smaller ones, such as Pea Ridge and Bentonville, are duds. Still, this is a solid system with some good scenarios, it just needs tweaking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Went back to this for the first time in a decade and my opinion of the game improved a bit. It's smooth, well-designed, and attractive. A bit of chaos added to what is essentially an update of the old Blue & Grey system yields a fun game. Most scenarios seem broadly historical in terms of the way the battles evolve.

There are some abstractions -- particularly in the combat system -- but from a 10,000-foot view it all comes out all right. If you think of combat happening all the time units are adjacent to each other (rather than just when the die is rolled), then all that back-and-forth of the combat system starts to make some sense. Still this is probably a better game for solitaire play than face-to-face, as you won't take it so personally when you get hosed by the untimely pull of a combat chit. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My son and I played this right after finishing a good game of Bull Run.  It didn't measure up, mostly because we both felt that the combat chit system made strategy less important.  Some of the mechanisms, while simple to understand, didn't quite work for us. I might try again, but for now the game was less than what I expected.

Like Dan wrote - A5A 2 never released, what I really regret. This is my favourite CIVI cosim. The Chit-Pull System is sometimes a horror ;o) (when you moved into a position, where you "win" when the battle-round of your opponent is drawn), but brings a nice way of fog of war.

RATING: 7
Very quick-playing and some jolly ideas, but the forced attacks are sometimes too drastic (e.g. the CSA being forced to attack across a bridge at Bull Run). Yes, you can withdraw, but then what's the point in occupying defensible terrain?
I think I need to try it with the optional "Defense" variant. Maybe it works better on the bigger battles, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As published, this is more a simulation of bumper cars than Civil War combat.  The biggest problem lies with the mandatory combat combined with the chit-pull activation system.  The best way to take a hill is to move next to it before your opponent pulls his combat chit, forcing him to attack down the hill or abandon it completely.  The system is much improved if played with a house rule that when his combat chit comes up, a player can ignore enemy units that have just moved adjacent to his units.  Even then, there are significant problems in the system, such as artillery behaving like infantry, forests being better defensive positions than hills, movement being far too slow to recreate historical rates of advance, and far too much factor counting (1-1 odds are bad, 2-1 odds are good, and there is nothing in-between).  The components make a very attractive package, and the chit pull system works nicely (once the bumper car problem is solved), but it's a shame that the rest of the system didn't get more development.

After abandoning the published system in favor of my own, I enjoy this a lot anymore.  The selected rating reflects my willingness to play using the published system with one of the bumper-car fix variants.

Great tactical ACW game. The chit-pull system was very innovative for its time. Only problem with the system is the situation where a player whose combat chit already has been chosen moves adjacent to the enemy, knowing that the enemy will have to attack (or retreat out of position) when his combat chit turns up. Feels too gamey.

Nice introductory level wargame, with chit draw for movement of divisions or corps.

Didn't care for the way combat worked.  Too often, players hope that they can advance adjacent to the enemy and then have *the opponent's* combat chit come out.  Would have preferred a more fire-oriented system to better capture the feel of the conflict (and to avoid precisely this problem).

RATING: 6
5 games in one package (versus the usual quadgame by SPI/TSR before).  Not all the battles are historically important but the Shiloh, Bull Run and Gettysburgh.  The system of design is simple enough but not simplistic.  The nice thing about this type of game is that you can actually have several games for just one price.  The designer knows the ACW well enough to pull off a convinving battle model, as opposed to the overly complicated, striving-at-all-cost-to-realism model such as "Great Battles of the American Civil War" (GBACW) series; or the too-simple sloppy TSR's Blue and Gray quad games. A right balance between playability and realism can been seen here.

NY - I only played this once while living in Maryland. It was with a guy in my car pool. He loved it, and I was relatively new to the whole hex and counter thing with ground tactical. It might have been my first American Civil War game on a board? I remember liking it. Asked a fellow in Singapore to try it, but his wish list was so long that I doubt to see it any time soon. I lent it to a friend's father a few years back and challenged him to it - he never took me up on it. I would be keen to explore this game more.

Great design with groundbreaking features, and lots of battles in a box.  The first time I saw chitpull activation in a 19th century game, long before Richard Berg picked it up.  Not only that, but this is a simple game that managed to break with the deadening 1970s tradition that simple games have to have stupid CRTs without the gradual attrition that would happen in any big battle. Add to that the fantastic Kibler maps and you have a winner.

The only game I can compare this set of battles with is GBACW, since I haven't played the Gamers offering.  This is a LOT simpler than GBACW, but it does have some issues that are easily solved in the other game.  All in all though it is good fun and the game plays fast (compare that to 3DoG!) With 5 battle scenarios in the box, it is also great value.

Enjoyable, quick-playing chit-pull game in which few games play out the same way twice or, for that matter, like practically any other games on these battles.  With the chaos of the chit-pull to activate formations and only one chance at combat for each side, per turn, it's difficult to stick to any plan one might have.  Defenders have the opportunity to stand and fight or to retreat voluntarily which provides the most interesting conflict in the game: hold your position or take a chance on combat in the face of near-certain death.
Not the best representation of history but, as a game, kind of fun if a bit chaotic.

RATING: 4
Based on play of only the smaller battles (Pea Ridge and Bentonville (?)).  Never tried Shiloh (supposedly the best scenario) or Gettysburg.  Nice maps and good value in the number of civil war battles offered in one box.

Chit draw system is OK for movement, but is very annoying for combat... often, this can translate into units that cannot fight back effectively while they are being trounced.  Seems to lead to some gamey tactics.  

Not a bad game, long out of print, and seemingly forgotten.  A planned followup game has never materialized.

One of my favorite American Civil War series.  It's a shame they never made Across 5 Aprils 2.  The chit pull mechanism is great and the mechanics are sound.  That being said, the retreat before combat rule is troublesome and some of the scenarios are problematic (I played a full game of Bull Run where there was no combat).  On the whole an enjoyable game.

I'm a huge fan of Civil war games and strategy, and wanted to like this game more.  Something in the mechanics just doesn't resonate with me, though.  I enjoy the game, but prefer other games at a similar level (such as the Gamer's brigade series).  Still a fun play though, and typically quicker than others in the same category.

RATING: 3
This could be a great entry level Civil War game, but it's doomed by the terrible combat chit rule.  Don't get me wrong - I like chit draw games for their random activation, but this one goes a step farther making combat both random and mandatory unless you want to pull back and watch your opponent just waltz into your recently vacated position.  Makes the Civil War look like an exercise in adjusting lines as opposed to combat.


Beyond that death strike, the maps are very well done, the rules perfectly simple, and counters plain in an effective / solid way.


I would consider playing again, but would have to house rule the combat chit rule or not use it altogether.  Either way, playing with that rule sapped my desire to want to break this out any time again in the near future.

I will state up front that I am a big fan of Eric Lee Smiths designs so it will come as no surprise when I say that I really enjoyed this one as well.  Across 5 Aprils was released by Victory Games in 1992 and allows players to recreate five battles from the American Civil War.  These battles are 1st Bull Run, Pea Ridge, Shiloh, Gettysburg and Bentonville.

Across 5 Aprils uses a chit-pull mechanism which means that players are never really sure which units are going to be moving next.  Added to this is the combat phase chit which allows the selected side to fight and the uncertainty goes up another notch, now you don’t know when your units will fight.  You can expect to find yourself drawing your combat phase marker before your troops are in position or when some of your troops are in position and your grand plans will come crashing down, or move into combat and watch your opponent retreat before the combat chit is drawn.  It’s enough to make you go grey.

Another factor which can contribute to you turning grey while playing this game is that units must attack enemy units in their ZOC, no standing around eyeballing the enemy.  This can lead to some interesting situations where your opponent moves up ready for combat but your combat phase chit gets pulled first but you don’t want to attack.  You can voluntarily retreat one hex or bombard with artillery, but there will be times when you are forced to attack when you don’t want to.  This adds another layer of battlefield chaos, but also emphasises the importance of a good defensive line supported by artillery, though this isn’t always possible.  

The battles range from large, like Gettysburg, to small, like 1st Bull Run.  But even Gettysburg can be played in one sitting, though I found it hard to get into the second day based on the first day victory conditions.  Another factor which helps Across 5 Aprils play in one sitting is that it moves at a steady pace.  There are never a truck load of counters on the map and the command chits mean you are only moving a small number of them at any one time.  This doesn’t mean there isn’t any tension though, believe me there is.  Most of the battles involve one side having to capture objective hexes and as the turns tick down it can get quite close, especially when the combat phase chit comes at the wrong time and you’re unable to launch the game winning attack! (Not that I’m bitter or anything)

Across 5 Aprils is a great way to spend a few hours.  The rules are easily picked up and set-up is a breeze.  All that’s left is to put the chits in the cup and start playing.  Definitely a keeper, and a game I’m glad to have in my collection.

Interesting design that relies heavily on luck and planning.  Unlike many turn based tactical games, units move in groups according to their corps and divisions.  It can be a bit tricky to coordinate attacks, when not everyone advances to the battle.  This simulates the problems of communication during the war.

Ok, I set started to set this up the other night and I got eye fatigued from trying to read the hex set-up numbers on the counters and quit. The eyes don't have it anymore so it won't get played. BUT this is one of the few games I kept after the last purge of almost 30 games in March 2004. Five battles of low-mid complexity and a novel Combat Results table. This was my first activation chit draw game. The barely controlled chaos had a very nice feel as I had just begun to read extensively about the ACW.

I always liked the old SPI Quadrigames, and VG did a creditable job with this set. They threw in some interesting twists like the chit draw activation, and they scaled each game to the scenario - not quite a 'one size fits all' cookie cutter series. Right up there with Berg's Civil War titles in quality.

I enjoyed it as a great solitaire game.  Chess-like moves with randomness of command control (Each side alternates moving each leader and his units by randomly drawing leader's name) creates an intense dynamic as each side struggles to hold the field. Five battles in one, each battle having seperate maps and counters similiar to the SPI Quad Games. Have made and posted to vassalengine.org VASSAL modules of the different battles so people can play on their computers.

In my one (solo) play (Gettysburg), I swept the board in the middle of the second day.  Plays fast except for all the retreating that has to be done.  Push-pull ballet too annoying after a while.  Not bloody enough.  Beautiful map and scale.  Too bad game is flawed.  Not sure if any variant can save it.  I'd like to try with no defender advance on auto-retreat (and calling combat chit whenever one likes?).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Some people don't like the randomness of the chit pull system and it can be frustrating when the battle chit comes up and you are not yet ready to launch an attack, but it does a good job of creating the chaotic and unpredictable atmosphere of Civil War battles without a complicated command and control system. The maps are colorful and the large counters a definite plus. I have not played the Gettysburg scenario, but Shiloh, Pea Ridge, and Bull Run felt right for the system but the smaller Bentonville scenario isn't anything to write home about. I wish one of the game companies would acquire the rights and make an Across Five Aprils II.

This game is fantastic. Great rulebook, good looking maps, 5 different games, All in one box. Its easy to learn and to teach and is a great introduction into wargaming. I taught it to my friend who had never played a wargame before and we were up and playing in about 15 mins. I really enjoy the uncertainty provided by the chit pull system. I like the flow of a turn: at the beginning of the turn, you have no idea what is going to be pulled, and as the turn progresses, the list of possible pulls gets shorter and shorter, making you more and more confident in your tactical decisions.

I enjoy the short play time. Very easy to get 2 or 3 scenarios played in an evening, so its great for competitive gaming. Highly recommended.

Resoundingly excellent ACW game that introduced me to the variable movement scenario. The game should be a one day Confederate walkover (Shiloh I mean), but the mechanics ensure that this is never the case, and introduce players into the very welcome discipline (absent from so many wargames) of learning to treat different corps as separate units.

Had more than a few games of this, and whilst it favours the defender - itself a reflection of the ACW - it's a fab game to try and outfox. 

Now I think on it, I must give it a try solo.

Four games in one. Each featuring a different Civil War battle. 
A good game for introducing newcomers to wargaming. I've played Bentonville dozens of times. But it works best for me because I live only ten miles from the actual battlefield. My kids have enjoyed the game because we've walked the battlefield so many times they feel familiar with it. Gave them a great feel for terrain features and the effects they can have.
This is a good game to play solitare because the movement and combat are initiated through a chit pull system.
And, for the record, Bentonville was actually fought in March!?!

I&#039;ll admit, it&#039;s nice to find a quick abstract game that can accomodate up to 6 players. But in reality it&#039;s hard enough to find 2 people to play an abstract these days. Other cons: the first player appears to have a distinct advantage (place pion in the middle for 5 influence instead of 4 anywhere else); this game is DESERT DRY, even for an abstract.
I doubt this will see play again within our group.

Abstract majority placement game with simple rules but challenging game play. I think of this as the multi-player brother of Knizia's 2-player [gameid=22305], which uses very similar principles (but adds a whole new layer of agonizing decisions).

A game of two halves, in which player's first get pieces to the board, and then move them around chasing the unclaimed points, whilst trying to avoid the penalties that accompany the scores that get claimed by others.

Players aim to gain single majorities on a 7x7 grid along its rows, columns, and 2 corner diagonals. On top, the grid has been divided in 7 blocks of different sizes that also get scored, giving a total of 23 scores to chase. You're given far too few markers to cover all angles, so you will have to rely on others for filling the areas you control and want to score, and at the same time move your markers to, and keep them in, places that shield you from huge penalties.

The skill is in positioning yourself so that it is attractive enough for others to join your row even if they aren't gaining any points, and make sure that on the occasions when you get a penalty (and you will, frequently), it is shared with others to minimise its impact. The score indicators will yo-yo around a fair bit, and if your Senator isn't close to the front at the end of your turn, you're probably in trouble as your score is likely to go down rapidly whilst others claim their points. Making your pending majorities attractive enough for others to fill the remaining spaces is key, and more importantly, avoid making them so unattractive that you will be the only one who will complete, and liberate your pieces is possibly even more important. It is obvious that any marker that counts towards more than one coin is a good thing, as long as you can avoid getting it tied up in unsettled draws. Getting your markers into the areas where the early action is is likely to get you a long way towards a decent finish. playing to avoid penalties alone will not make you a winner.

There isn't much room to manoeuvre on, but I have witnessed some ingenious placement decisions, and for a multiplayer game it works very very well.

The Roman theme is cute, but non-existent. It is highly abstract in nature, plays fast, but at the same time is meaty enough to make for a very decent filler.

If I hadn't played the Knizia one I would possibly rate this higher. But as that added a mechanism that allowed players to gain a majority in unfilled areas through fiendish play, it did make this one feel a bit more basic and pedestrian.

The production standard is fantastic, mostly as a result of including some of the finest game coins ever produced and a beautiful hand-drawn board. A minor blemish is that the fold-out board of the reprint has a cut that looks like an extra grid divider, something that is no issue with the vinyl roll-up board version. A small detail though, and one that can't get in the way of a fast playing filler that will appeal even to players who normally shun abstracts.

RATING: 8
Have the 2012 New Games Order Japanese edition. My Japanese isn't that good so I am using the 1994 English rules file that I found on BGG. Currently, I've only played the 2-player variant twice.

The board art and design are nice while the rest of the components are functional. Thematically, players want their Senator to be the most popular so they send their Romans into the Forum to secure popularity and patronage in a bid to become consul. Mechanically this is represented by players placing their pieces on the board and attempting to fill up lines and buildings. Once one of these has been filled, the player with the most Romans in line or building gains points according to the number of spaces in the line(7) or building(6,8 or 9). The player with the least amount of Romans loses 4 points. If 2 players are tied for the least amount of Romans they each lose 2 points. The player with the most points wins.

So far this has been a fun tactical match of wits. The initial placement of your Romans seems easy enough but needs to be made with care. You need to leave yourself the flexibility to take advantage of scoring opportunities. Lots of tough choices to be made!

If you've always thought that Knizia's games have a pasted-on theme, then you haven't played this stinker. Mind you, I do like good 2-player abstracts, but when there's a crowd, I want something different.

RATING: 6
This one is more abstract than I usually go for. Its also one of those games where one player making a poor choice can greatly benefit another player....and doing so repeatedly can throw the game. 

Its kind of like a big fancy tic-tac-toe variant in a lot of ways.

I like to insist reading the flavor text as we scored each region, but to be honest that didn't really make the game a whole lot more thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rules make it seem fluffy, filler-esque even, and the time that it takes to play is on par with such a designation, but there is so much to keep track of in this game! Every piece is simultaneously affecting at least 3 potential scorings, and there just aren't enough to go around on the board. Completely abstract, and deserving of its designation as advanced tic tac toe, but also unique and, even though I'll never be blown away by anything like this, just deepens my respect for Kramer as a designer, as it shows his ability to also make games which have simple rules, but which manage to produce depth by the player interactions. (BTW: the scoring track on the mat version: artistic but 100% impractical for actual use)

Components: Great wooden pieces. The faux-leather board is sturdy, but the graphic layout and art leaves a lot to be desired, with several design elements making it difficult to identify groups of squares (the diagonals, the buildings).

Experience: This was immediately lots of fun. The game moves quickly, the points oscillate violently, but in all it becomes more and more tactical as there are fewer groups left to score. Very simple mechanism leading to interesting choices.

Really like the board/mat nice production and as for the coins well what can you say? Senator pieces are a bit weak! It's a strange game but certainly a thought provoker. First game I messed up the least penalty not realising that 0 would be considered the least, therefore a lot of people got away without having to have a presence in a line or room and not getting penalised for it. All in all a good little game which is fun to play and relatively quick too!

Good multi-player abstract strategy game with easy rules. The goal is to gain majorities in a row, column, diagonal or room (positive points) and avoid being left out when a majority is scored (negative points). The typical disadvantage for most multi-player abstracts is the dependency on the skill of the other players.

Solid multi-player area control abstract.  First player has a pretty good advantage, perhaps this could be fixed by allowing points to the other players.  Please let me know if you have a working solution to this.  Tough decisions and even a bit of a stock game in that something doesn't get scored until it fills up and it's important that you can score with your pieces so that you can use them elsewhere.

Place counters into a Roman campus. Scoring is triggered when column, row or room is full. Player with most tokens gets points for number of counters, but players with least tokens lose points.  I've only played this game with 6 players. The first player gets an advantage by placing in the middle, being in on 5 scoring places and thus reducing his chances of losing points. It's not a bad try at a strategic token placement game, but it seemed too chaotic with 6 players. Maybe it works better with less.

This is a pretty good multi-player abstract.  It works exactly how it is supposed to.  If it weren't for the obvious strength of placing the first pawn in the center of the board, I would even go so far as to say it was flawless.  Sadly, it just isn't all that exciting.  Clever, yeah.  Innovative, certainly. But, fun? I'm not so sure.  I do really like that there is incentive to keep the game scoring by encouraging players that aren't winning to close out sections to not be in last.

Pretty simple area control game that builds in intensity throughout the course of its 30 minute play time. You have a very limited number of influence markers and as you run out of the initial set, you have to pull existing pieces off the board and move to other locations. This causes some lock up and need to make critical decisions.

It's an interesting abstract, kind of like a complex tic-tac-toe.  The initial phases of the game are pretty simple, but in the middle and end game, it shines as you're trying to finish things off where you have the majority while trying to avoid the minorities.

A very simple, very abstract, majorities game. The unnecessarily large and fancy Franckh production is great. This is an interesting exercise and plays in just the right amount of time (about 15-20 minutes). Unfortunately, the game seems to suffer from both a first player advantage (the center square is obviously the most valuable, and going earlier in turn order makes it easier to win majorities), and a rich-get-richer syndrome, as tokens in areas that score first are freer to move to other parts of the board.

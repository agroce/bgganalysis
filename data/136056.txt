This game has a few things I'm not as much of a fan of. The amount of text slows the game down a bit for new players and some people suffer from analysis paralysis. Only drawing one card per turn as the rules state makes card draw of the utmost importance. (Which has frustrated some people I've played with but not myself) Overall, though this game works well. Some cards seem overpowered but most of them seem overpowered so it works. :)

Again there is no rating for this game because it was never played. Set up, yes. Played, no. Why? Asante plays pretty much identically to Jambo. There are however these holy site cards that are used in the game. Problem is , no where in the rule book does it say how they are used.

This is the kind of game that really needs several games to know the cards and possible interactions within them.  Fast and simple card game, pull and push against the partner.  With a simple objective, there are many things to try and interact with the opponent.  Beautifully illustrated.  Looks like a very interesting game once you know what to expect from the cards.  

UPDATE: After a couple of games more, impression gets even better.

Whatever, it's more Jambo. I like the holy sites, and think I'll always play with them from now on, but I think I prefer having the extra market stalls from Jambo. I also think there is a better goods distribution in the Jambo base game. I'll have to try integrating the two. Lots of room for experiment and replayability here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game, beautifully illustrated, with a real variety of card effects to explore and, I suspect, deeper levels of tactics to be revealed on further plays. That would also confirm whether the randomness decreases with experience - more card drawing may be the key - and whether artifacts are as overpowered as first impressions suggest - there's certainly seems to be a real advantage if you can get the first couple down first as they provide important permanent additions to your tactical space at the expense of one-off bonuses for your opponent. Regardless, it's engaging enough that I'm pretty sure I'd enjoy playing enough to discover the answers to those questions; which could well increase my rating.

Juego de comercio para 2 muy correcto. La gran variedad de cartas, efectos e interacciones entre ellas le da una jugabilidad muy interesante, y aunque pueda parecer aleatorio, a medida que aprendes a jugar empiezas a ver por donde tienes que ir jugando tus cartas para sacar tu máximo beneficio. Interesante que gastes los "puntos de victoria" para jugar cartas, hay momentos que aunque parezca que vayas a ganar necesitas bajar tu puntuación para conseguir hacer funcionar las cartas. Muy recomendado, complejidad la justa y un tema que no suele desagradar a nadie.

I enjoy the addition of the wild good cards, but dislike the 4 identical good cards since without extra stall options they are a pain. The Holy Sites don't add anything for me. The starting carts on heavy card stock are a plus. In the end Jambo was better.

RATING: 7
For a game that is supposedly themed around being merchants and trading wares for profit there is an awfully large amount of stuff in Asante that is concerned with non-merchanty stuff.

That being said, nobody said making good deals was going to be easy, and it certainly isn't with all those special cards getting in the way. Card powers seem to be all over the place and highly situational. That might not be a such a big problem when both players know the deck and the game flows accordingly, but for the first games the likelihood of being hosed unawares is a distinct disadvantage.

Still, the cards seem sufficiently interesting to merit further plays and not worry about card balance for the moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of my favorite two player games. A card game about trading wares in an African market. Lots of depth and replay value because of card variety, each of which fits really well with the theme. Requires several plays to become familiar with all the different cards. Well worth the time though. Great interaction without being overly aggressive; perfect amount for my wife and me.
Very highly recommended! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Same rating as Jambo as it is essentially the same game. It has an extra layer (The Holy Places) that give minor bonuses, but other than that it plays out pretty much the same. The cards are pretty powerful in this one, offering some chances for big bonus payouts. Love the Smuggler and Colonist cards! I have mixed the cards into the Jambo box and will log future plays under Jambo only.

Once again I broke my own CotN rule by giving this a 10 after 1 play, but since I added it to all of my Jambo cards it really is an extension of that game. The new cards we encountered were really interesting, and I love the addition of the Holy Places. Definitely a Top 10 game for me with everything included.

The cards were quite flimsy, something I wasn't expecting. It makes shuffling the giant deck quite difficult.

That aside, what I had been expecting from the game play and what occurred were two different things. We found that the win was mostly determined by complete chance...card pulls. There were more than a few rounds in which both the hubs and I spent all our actions drawing for a single helpful card.

I won by a wide margin, and it can be pinpointed to a single card. That doesn't seem balanced at all to me. Will we play it again? I hope so. I hope the games that follow are less up to chance.

I could see my rating here rising; my second game was way better than my first. Interesting and intricate card-combo game, with an action-point allowance that forces hard decisions. But the underlying "buy some goods, sell some goods" system pulls it down a bit.

This is basically "Jambo" with different cards, but there is a new mechanic that acts as a bit of compensation for when the opponent plays an artifact card.

RATING: 8
This is a pretty fun game.  Like many games we own the objective is to make money by trading with the market using various trading opportunities that come up.  You also get opportunities to play cards that foil your opponent.  It's a common theme but a pretty good game.  Not as nice as Splendor or Jaipur for this, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This, in short, is more Jambo goodness from Rudiger Dorn (in a format that could also be standalone should there be a need to). From initial plays, the cards in this game seem to favour cycling between resource types (e.g., converting cards, plural, into wares, plural), and accordingly, providing more opportunities to draw additional cards. While none of this entirely novel tot he game as within Jambo, there were certainly cards (or more precisely artifacts) which allowed you to do so, this seems to really invigorate the role of both cards and wares such that they are not simply accessories to the central economy but rather have become resources of their own with variable exchange rates. 

However, this is not to say that there isn't anything wholly new either. The "Holy Places" are a small novel twist on the game which grant you a free action to be taken later (e.g., take a gold, take an additional action, trade a ware for another) every time you place an artifact. While this was never a major problem, this certainly provides productive possibilities to a player who finds themselves with 3 artifacts in play and more in their hand.

Overall, more gaming goodness (and gold tokens in an increased size!).

The game still lacks any kind of architecture in wich you could develop a strategy. All you can do is play the cards as they come. This time, in an attempt to make this fresh to use also as a Jambo expansion, most of the card effects are fiddy but still repetitive, making this stand alone game strange to play, having played Jambo before or not.

Fun game for 2 players about making good deals. It has a very strong luck element with often no real way to mitigate - bad card draws can really screw you. Because of this, it has not seen the table that often.

Can be played together with Jambo, its predecessor. I think Asante is the better game of the 2. Having both does not improve the experience, but rather makes it harder to get good moves working due to the different focus of the cards.

RATING: 7
Es un juego exclusivo para dos personas en el que, de nuevo, está ambientado en un mercadoo del África Subsahariana. Es una evolución o reimplementación de otro juego llamado Jambo

Es un juego económico cuyo objetivo es conseguir transformar 20 piezas de oro con las que empezamos en 60. Para ello deberemos comprar y vender mercancías. Hay una gran variedad de cartas que podemos clasificar en cuatro grandes grupos: las cartas de mercancías que compramos y vendemos, utensilios con una habilidad especial de un solo uso o no, cartas de personajes con habilidades que generalmente te favorecen y cartas de animales con habilidades que generalmente perjudican al contrario. Toda esta variedad desemboca en muchas estrategias útiles para ganar y en una rejugabilidad elevada.

No es un juego especialmente complicado, pero creo que gana a Jaipur en profundidad, a Seven Wonders en variedad de elecciones y a Tuareg en sencillez.

Tiene dos principales pegas. La primera se basa en que carece de estructura con la que desarrollar una estrategia. Esto es bastante habitual en juegos de cartas y especialmente en este, en el que sólo robas "por defecto" una carta por turno, teniendo que adaptarte a lo que te toca. Así es difícil desarrollar una estrategia

En segundo lugar, su segunda gran crítica está orientada al texto en las cartas de personajes, que es bastante extenso. Por ello, las primeras partidas se alargan más de lo esperado.

A game about resource trading and selling for gold which are points for the game. Peppered in the deck are a bunch of MTG style of cards that either helps your game engine or directly influence your opponents. The game is fun but felt a little too long and repetitive for what its aiming to do. The randomness of the cards are also a big turn off for me especially towards the end game when some of the cards don't help in your gameplay at all.

RATING: 5
Far from great. Focus for dealing with marketplace is minor here and mostly you try to hazzle with the action and artifact cards... and that's something which why I'm not fond. Other complain here is text-oriented cards: if you play this regularly that might not be an issue, but when played every now and then... well, it makes the game not that smooth to play. So, nice-to-try -experience to me, but nothing to me to want it more.

This game plays much like Jambo and in fact can be combined to play a massive card deck with Jambo.  However, there is only one market stall for each person which restricts a bit of collection of goods and some of the artifacts/cards feel very strong.  The other significant difference is the introduction of holy sites which are special power cards that are taken or given based on the play of artifact cards.

Got this for my wife after 100+ games of Jambo. There are two things that I immediately noticed: Firstly, the greater variety in combinations on goods cards reduces quick turnaround, requiring more clever card play. Secondly, the cards all seem more useful, and more interesting in that they suggest a wider variety of strategies.

As a new mechanism, the addition of land cards (onto which artefacts are played) doesn't seem to have a huge overall impact on the game, although this might be because the number of artefact cards feels reduced (I've yet to verify this). Could be interesting when mixed with Jambo.

Given how much I love Jambo, and how this is essentially the same theme and mechanisms but with a whole new set of choices, I can't help but love this too.

Ok game, but there is a ton of text on the cards. May not sound so bad but the entire first game you'll spend reading cards. After that it gets kinda fun, but this is not a game I can enthusiastically introduce to other players. I'm not adverse to complex games (I prefer medium-heavy games), but the general unelegant design was a turn off.

Me gusta bastante este juego. La cantidad de cartas que trae hace que cada juagada sea muy, muy distinta. Además, la estrategia en cada una de ellas también cambia incluso en la mano que traes, ,pues al tener que jugar las cartas en cierto orden, tienes que estar muy concentrado en lo que tienes que hacer.

This is a remake of Jambo, which I never got a chance to play. It reminds me of a CCG in that many of the cards have a wall of text explaining some special ability. Repeat play can get you over that hurdle, but if you are only playing this every once in awhile it can be a chore reading cards and remembering their powers.

Unexpectedly this game became one of my favourite two players games.
The rules were during the first read a bit confusing but after one play it became clear.

It's a charming game with some opportunities for tactical choices.

I was a bit worried from how simple the rules were, but there is quite a few choices each turn. Getting only 1 card a turn makes your hand management a big thing. Some of the cards lets you draw more, so keep a look out for those. My only complaint is the cardstock is a bit flimsy. I feel like a card game that focuses predominantly on drawing and playing cards shouldn't have skimped on the quality.

RATING: 8
I like this one a lot. It's relatively fast (usually takes us ~20 minutes) with the opportunity for some cool card combos.  There is a nice mix of strategy, tactical play and random elements.  The random elements add some nice surprises to the game and help level the playing field a bit. I'm not crazy about cards that let you name a card and then flip through the deck looking for one. In practice, you often spend a minute flipping through 40 cards to find what you are looking for.  The concept is fine, but this adds some strange lulls in gameplay.

After one play I can already tell the designer is trying to speed up the game. There are more cards to cycle through the draw deck even though not necessarily drawing those cards into your hand. It forces the players to think hard about what cards to keep. I am already looking forward to mastering these cards and then combine with Jambo for a huge game.

This is the same, really the same as Jambo. This could easily have been 'Jambo: expansion 3', which would have been a more honest choice, because really, who is waiting for exactly the same game with just other cards?

Jan 2014 - 8.0 - Although separate game, this is basically the same as Jambo. There is one new interesting mechanic: Holy Places. I feel that special powers on cards in Asante are much stronger than in Jambo. On the other hand card quality is worse than in Jambo.

This game takes playing a few times to get the interaction of the cards.  Don't be afraid to waste actions on drawing/discarding more cards to get something more effective.  Gaining gold is hard early on, but later in the game once more artifacts and areas are in play it becomes easier.

RATING: 7
've now played 4 games of Asante , the standalone expansion to Jambo and it really brought back those feelings of hunting for a deal as you spend your actions to sift through the cards either for a suitably powerful card or a useful goods card. I owned Jambo but sold it back in 2011? as it never quite worked for me but my tastes have changed and I'm enjoying Asante more than I did Jambo. It's just so different from other card games, which I why I think Mr Dorn is so proud of it, and why I'm not quite at ease with it. 

I played a few games trying to build up artifacts that I could then spam to victory but they are so fragile and beneficial to your opponent that it seems to be a doomed strategy. My biggest concern is that the game seem forces you to go for one turn combos as having goods in your market stall, or using artifacts to draw extra cards usually invites the other player to play something powerful. There just aren't enough cards to counteract this and the ones that do exist like the Colonist bring their own issues.

At 30-45 minutes (2 games of RftG) I need to see if it will become a regular part of our games rotation but if it does I'll definitely track down another copy of Jambo to add some more variety.
Recommended. 

---
An incredibly frustrating game notably caused by the strength of some of the fuck you cards and the luck of the draw.  

Luck - Oh you spent all your actions and found no good cards. I spent 1 and got just the card I needed.
Buffalo - Oh look you have a nice artifact that you spent turns drawing, placing and giving me a holy place for. I think I'll use that and then destroy it. 
Colonist - I'm winning so I get more cards, more gold and more resources just to make sure I'm winning more! Oh now I get to play another one. I don't understand why you're so bad at this game.
Animalist - Just used 3 actions to play a card? Well now it has no effect. Oh you had two of them, well so did I. Go fuck yourself.

This is an example for a single game. Needless to say if this shit keeps up I'll flush it down the toilet.

There are several very powerful cards in the deck. On the other hand there are many more cards that aren't of any use or that you just cannot put use to in the moment.

It makes the Take that-cards even more devastating as they already are

For good and bad, it's Jambo. I was hoping this game would address the main flaw of Jambo, being that there are often turns where you really just can't do much because you don't have the cards you need. The holy places help to add more options, but they're not enough. I might try playing this with the huts from Jambo since they offer more options to help stop wasted turns.

RATING: 6.5
PROS: This sort of standalone Jambo expansion is a very neat trading game, players dispute to reach the same objective first but there are several ways to do it. Ware cards, effects cards, artifacts, holy places. This whole range of options combined with a small 6-slot tent is what makes the game interesting to me. You may filter the type of wares you have to get the best sales, dig for the cards you need, try to hold you opponent back, and so on. There's a lot of back and forth and player interaction, not in a destructive way, but effects that mimic you opponents' tent, make him choose things for you, give you bonuses based on comparison between your tents, cards and gold. In other words, effects that will benefit you but involve you opponent's decisions or table situation. 

CONS: With a whole range of card effects, the focus may diverge a bit from the trading aspect. Also, some effects may be nice but others will leave you wondering "do I really need to play this(these) card(s) or will the 1 gold from saving 2 action tokens be more valuable in the long run?"; It also seems kind of luck dependant, with an advantage to the player that has access to more card draws during the game, and perhaps a poor catching-up system for the player in second place, but more experimentation is needed, there might be ways to overcome the lack of luck and lack of "cards that draw cards"; The cards' translation is somewhat poor, a lot of questions / ambiguity / issues not covered by the rulebook came up after a couple of plays; 

OBS: Rating subject to change - needs more plays to understand how much luck really is involved in this game.

Another favorite 2 player game of ours that hits the table often.
A card game with an outstanding theme, one of the richest I've played. Can be a little overwhelming on the first play or so because of the number of different cards. Takes several plays, at least 8-10, to become familiar enough with the deck to be able to predict your opponent's cards. But when that familiarity happens you're rewarded with a very deep game with tons of replay value.

Asante is a fine game, but it's not Jambo. It's streamlined compared to Jambo, but not in a good way.

I really didn't.

Interesting reimplementation of [gameid=12002].  There's not a whole lot of reason to own both, but the basic idea from that game is still good.  There's an interesting tradeoff between actions and cards, and figuring out whether to settle for what you get, or whether to use actions digging for what you need is crucial.  It's got good decisions, and is interesting.

If forced to choose, I'd probably go with Jambo, but it's a close race, and you're not going to go wrong with Asante instead.

An incredible stand-alone game which works equally well as an expansion to Jambo. Jambo was already one of my favorite 2-player games; can't help but love this.

On a negative note: the card stock for Asante feels really thin, certainly thinner than Jambo. Not thrilled with that.

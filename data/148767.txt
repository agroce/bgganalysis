For a childrens game I think it's quite nice. The kids like fighting the dragon or save the princes, and at the same time they learn basic tile placement.
Nice little game that is easy to learn, and nice to play together.

Present for my 3 - 1/2  years old son. He has felt in love with it immediately, a surprise also for me since it's the first game he manages to wait for his turn and avoid destroy the game in the halfway and mess with my daughter's patience.

Great first tile laying experience for the kids, I enjoy playing with them expecting more complex games in the future.

As kids games go, this one is a nice tile laying game.  There are choices to make and enough happening to keep a child with some gaming experience interested.

Draw a tile, play a tile. Match the right tile (or combo of tiles) and complete a task. Works well enough as a kids' introduction to tile-laying games.

RATING: 6.7
This is a good children's game and I believe deserves about an 8 for children.  As an adult, I would knock this down to around a 6.  There's just not a lot of substance here.  I do like using the Knight as an extra turn as well as the connecting of the six tiles in order to win a tournament and place a free task.  Good introductory game for children.

It is for children, primary, so that's why I give it a 9 stars, cause along with it you tell old chavalry stories while having lots of fun. Enjoyable.

This is OK as an "intro to tile laying" game.  Drawing one tile at a time and being forced to play certain tiles makes this game feel a little bit on rails.

Absolutely gloriuos! The perfect tile-placement game for small children (4-6yo) Before Carcassonne. Fast, tense, enjoyable. The triangle-shaped tiles are a hit - more challanging then a square.

RATING: 6.5
very nice artwork with a lot to discover on the different tiles. Gameplay is pretty limited in strategic depth: avoid building the 5th tile of the tournament field and look for double turns with the knight ...

Very nice children's game reminiscent of Carcassonne. Not too much strategy but enough that kids can learn something with repeated plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A good pre-cursor to [gameid=822] but pretty dull for adults. The production's great and I like how the triangle tiles go together. Highlights include a joust tournament which can be won by finishing the circle (6 tiles) allowing you to complete any task AND a horse that moves around the board, but when you place next to it you earn an extra turn.

My kid (4) could not stop playing... good thing dinner time arrived as we'd still be there.

Fun and easy to learn even with just 2 players. (and sufficiently entertaining that parents won't complain of a few rounds).

Edit: uped a bit cause kid keeps on asking to play it and it's my wife's go to game to play with him.

Boost the rating by a couple points if you are gaming with the target market, a young future gamer. Five-year-old is probably the sweet spot here; my five-year-old enjoys it. Very few decisions though. Not a game for adults (but then it doesn't pretend to be). A training game.

Purchased to mainly play 2 player with a five year old. Play time is short enough that a kid won't get bored. Colorful enough. Rules are simple enough with only a few ambiguities to clarify. Feels weak on strategy though even for a kids game and comes down to luck of the draw. This can be good though as it allows kids to play against adults on equal footing.  I would only expect this game to remain popkular with a kid for a year, not much longer.

RATING: 6
1 play, 2er (adults)

For me: 5 or 6? I'd play it if a child wanted to play, if I played with children

For kids: 7 or 8?

This is a pretty simple tile laying game, a bit too random for adults. Main choice is tile play, and you generally just want to complete whatever spaces you can since you will either place a tile, or deny your opponent that spot.  

[b]--- Rules ---[/b]
Everyone gets a number of task tiles which each show 2 different colors (combinations of red/blue/green/yellow), kept face up in front of them. On your turn, draw and place a (triangular) tile, Carcassonne-style (i.e., matching edges).
- If you create a place with an X in a color on any of your task tiles, may place one of them there.
- If you create a circle in the center of 6 tiles, place any of your task tiles there.
- If the tile you placed has a picture of Conrad the Confused, place the Conrad meeple there.
- If the tile you placed was adjacent to Conrad, take another turn (max 1 extra turn). 

The first player to place all their task tiles wins.

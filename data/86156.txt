Ideally, working as a group the players are trying to convey the message to the team member who is trying to guess. In practice, the group redundantly acts out the same thing as individuals short circuiting the entire concept. I approve of the large lettering on the cards, however.

This game shouldn't work. So many people simply hate playing Charades, and yet somehow just flipping the script and putting them on the spot with a group makes everyone open up. Whether it's a group of women trying to charade "Ultimate Fighting" or a group of guys working as a team to get "Ultrasound" it seems to lead to countless laughs. Even when someone is stumped it can be hilarious seeing their face when they hear the right answer. It's not all perfection with this game, though. I have 2 minor complaints, and one is just something you'll find with any game of this type. If your team's guesser gets stumped it can cause all kinds of frustration for them. If you have a large enough group I'd suggest having a pair of guessers, just so one person doesn't "feel stupid." My only other complaint is that the game should come with more cards. Considering the size of the box it comes in I wish they could have loaded it with cards, instead of having a smaller box inside the big box. Yet this is still an amazingly fun game, and will always be in the bag when I'm going to large parties. The teens at church love it, and I'll play any time.

This game was much more fun than I thought it would be.  My only complaint is that the target words are too easy.  I've only played it once, but in our game I don't think any team had to "perform" for more than 4 or 5 seconds before the word was correctly guessed.  We did laugh a lot though.

RATING: 6
Highly entertaining, but very repetitive.  The cards vary in difficulty just like any Charades game.  I am disappointed that so many cards can be done solo and do not require a team.

RATING: 6.5
The idea sounded terrible to me, but it was actually quite fun. However, the cards were ridiculously easy, which made the game far less fun than it could have been. Perhaps next time, we'll play with a deck of Time's Up! cards.

UPDATE: Turns out you're supposed to get as many cards as possible during the time frame, not just 1. That makes it a much more playable game.

Components: iOS version: it's cheap, which is good. But players must take more care to handle the iPhone, and set it down properly, than they would with flimsy cards; this slows down gameplay.

Experience: In general, this is a good and fun concept. The embarrassment factor goes down, as more players are the actors; but the on-the-spot factor goes up as only one player is the guesser. The it's-fun-to-watch factor is a bit of a wash; certainly what's being acted is more fun to watch, but there are fewer people left over to watch it.

My main complaint is that the words/phrases do not all lend themselves well to teamwork. With 'Big Bad Wolf', one person can be the wolf, and another the house or the little pigs; but with 'seahorse', there aren't any interesting roles to dole out beyond that of a seahorse. I think the most interesting aspect of the game is when the actors, without communicating, must each silently take up a part in the narrative, and get it to work together. This is a cornerstone of improv comedy. When two players are both pretending to be seahorses, it's not as interesting. Here's a quick sampling of words/phrases that don't let the game grow to its full potential:rattlesnake, fly a kite, outhouse, flip-flops, sleepwalk, claustrophobia.

Like Catch Phrase, and unlike Time's Up, the game suffers for having no through-narrative. The words themselves have no relation to each other, so a game has no cohesive narrative arc.

I had played charades numerous times during my childhood. Reverse Charades makes the classic game even better. There is nothing more silly than a whole group trying to get just one person to make a guess. Not one of my favorite games, but a really cool game for parties with non-gamers.

This is one of those games that you really may as well just get on as a mobile app and you won't miss a single thing, since the game is just a timer and a collection of cards with words or phrases on them.  It's not that much different from regular Charades, except that a team is working together to help one other team member guess as many words as possible inside one minute while the other team watches.  But that one change does add a whole new layer of fun.  The words tend to be better suited to a group of people, but the truth is that most good Charades players could deal with them as a single person just fine.  I've had great success with this so far.

Must be played with a very large group in teams of 3 or preferably 4 or more. It's best to have at least 2-3 people acting and 1 guessing. so minimum players would be 6 (2 teams of 3) but better with 12 (3 teams of 4).

What a hoot.  The most fun is when you are on the team that is not up, just watching the group doing stuff.  Great when a team figures out to work together on a clue, and not just do it independently.  We made a great bucket brigade, too bad it was supposed to be an assembly line.

Watching multiple people simultaneously acting out items with one person guessing can be hilarious.  We played in a large hall with multiple other gaming groups, and we had a blast.  Players can use any objects in the room, and we enjoyed running between tables with grandiose actions.  Some of the others in the hall may not have been quite as amused.

the idea can be fun, but this published deck of cards is a poor buy, there are so many cards in there that are no fun to do as a group.  youd be much better off just coming up with your own words.

RATING: 8
Such a simple idea for a game that it almost seems wrong to charge for it.  But it works well and a lot of the cards require coordination of different roles on the part of the actors which really sets this apart from most other games.  So simple to teach and learn and guaranteed fun.  The only caveat is that the players have to be pretty uninhibited.

I did not expect this party game to go over so well.  This game has been a blast every time.  I really wish the other sets you can buy with this would come with more cards, and fewer repeats.  I was going to buy the junior edition, but it has so many non-unique cards.  I think I'll make some of my own.

This is a fantastic party game, and officially my current favorite.

Our first game was very nearly a zero-zero tie, but our second and third games were competitive and flowed really well -- this takes a round to get used to. It's looser than charades, and encourages going with your gut and getting to know your team.

It's just as much fun to watch as it is to be the active team, and just as much fun (in a different way) to be the guesser as it is to be one of the actors. It also plays quickly and has that "Ooh, one more game!" factor. Throw in the fact that it has short rules and is intuitive to anyone who's played Charades, and this is a great package overall.

My one quibble is that the cards are the same color on both sides, which makes reusing cards harder to avoid. They need to be a different color on the front and back, or there should be a little divider in the card box, or both. That doesn't prevent this from being an awesome party game, though.

Hilarious!  This one caused me to nearly have an asthma attack from laughing so hard.  Play this with experienced gamers/Euro gamers and it'll provide lots of fun and wonderful memories.  Games that make people laugh this hard is a winner in my books.  Don't mix all the expansions packs together, I recommend choosing a pack and playing with that.  For gamers who's English is not their second language, I would recommend using the base game only, as some of the other expansions are very language oriented.  Occasionally you'll come across words/phrases that are specific to America, but we house rule it, if the player's not from the States, and they say something similar, we let them have the point, because it's not all about winning hehe.  
You can play it using the iPad/iPhone/iPod touch.

Some of the cards are more fun than others.  It seems like more than half of the cards don't really require more than one person giving clues....so it kind of turns into regular charades.  I've read that the Sports version may be a bit different, so I'm interested in trying that one out...

When the cards work, it's a lot of fun though...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Game in a Nutshell: It's Charades except there's only one guesser with the rest acting out the clues.

Played as: 16 player, 2 teams

Pros: Provides a meaningful twist on the age old party game. I love the emphasis on cooperation especially when there are some clues that demand it (try doing a hammock with one person better than three). Can be full of imagination and laughs.

Cons: The thing I liked the least is that the time element made it so that it was hard for my imagination catch up and fully explore the potential of each clue. It's also tough when there's no telling if the guesser would even know what the clue is if they saw it... you could act something out perfect, think they'll get it any second, but ever will.

Other: I played with some pretty large teams and I think the game is meant for smaller groups. With too many things don't coordinate and it just looks like a mad scramble. With 3 or so actors to a team, I think things would look much tighter. I'm not sure if that leaves the game with a really weird sweet-spot. Since I didn't play with the suggested number of players, I've choose not to rate it.

Best Use: I reserve the right to hold off on this...

When we need a laugh, need cheered up, or have a large group, Reverse Charades is our go-to game. It would be really hard to play this and not laugh. It isn't nearly as intimidating as regular charades since a group of people all act at once. Even if one person chooses to just stand there looking awkward the game will still work just fine.

Good times!  This seemed to be a lot less intimidating than regular Charades since the majority of your team is acting at once.  It was fun to see how the players came together to come up with a way for the group to act out a word/phrase.  One problem we had was that some of the cards seemed to be *a lot* harder than others.  It would have been helpful to have an easy and hard side to the cards that you could choose between when playing.  

*Also own iPad version* I picked this one up because it came with all of the different versions of the game.  I have yet to play the regular version on the iPad, but we've played Reverse Charades Junior at school and my students love it!

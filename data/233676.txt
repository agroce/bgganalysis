RATING: 8
It's a very good game with a simple mechanism of "action shifting" you can manipulate and personalize depending on what strategy you want to focus on. I played twice with three players and the interaction on the chambers was mean in both cases. Despite of what's been argued by someone about the initial casuality of senators' positioning (and removing) in the chambers, I felt a sort of tension like in  a cold war in which you don't know if it's better wait the others reveal their interests in particular chambers despite others, or be the first to reveal your intentions.
In both plays I had this feelling you need to create some  implicit alliance because you need someone else betting with you on a particular chamber; otherwise it could be too easy for the opponents bring your chamber down.
On the other side of the coin, this possibility should limit the runaway leader because if I am the only one climbing a chamber up, the opponents could soon remove senators from that chambers and punish my efforts.
In conclusion, a very good solid game and one of my favourite of 2017.

Thoroughly boring and fiddly, especially that silly wheel.  Bits are constantly being jostled out of their holes and being 'lost' under the wheel.  The fact that you have to turn it every turn makes it doubly so.  The players who can build the most factories the quickest soon run away with the game, making it impossible for anyone else to catch up.  On top of all that, it has no theme as far as I can tell, and is way too long for what it is.  Steer clear of this one - you have better things to do with your time.

So much going on this game, but in a good way.  The wheel building mechanic is so intriguing and leads to many different ways to approach the game.  

With all of the points in teh game based on your level of the various tracks, and the fact that you have to move/manipulate the board to get the right levels creates a tense dynamic between players and which tracks get bumped.

I am intrigued and really want to play this game more to see how it plays out.  The only minor concern I have for this game is that it is 100% open information, so I have a mild concern that it could get solved relatively quickly.

First Play: (4 players): More of a stock market feel to this rather than building anything. The competition for the values of the various commodities works well with 4 but I understand why the game trips itself up with only 2 players. The player disks is a nice mechanic although the rules did seem to be unnecessarily opaque in places. Happy to play again.

RATING: N/A
Before playing Noria, I knew almost nothing other than it had nice artwork. I did play it and, apparently, not with all the right rules. Nonetheless, the play did show me that this is an engine-building style game where your engine is a three wheel apparatus that hold little cardboard discs that indicate available actions. The top wheel includes two actions which will be available every other turn; the middle wheel includes four actions that are available for two turns and then unavailable for the next two turns; the bottom wheel includes six actions available for three turns and then unavailable for three. But, you're only getting one action per wheel per turn. It's a neat mechanism though it may be more fiddly than it's worth.

The scoring is also interesting as players are climbing tracks and each track is relatively easier or more difficult to climb. There are numbers below the track that show how each step on the track will score at the end of the game. Players can move cubes down to cover the lowest or highest number to score on the track. It feels like a really clever scoring approach that didn't play out nearly as interesting in our game as it felt like it could. I wonder how often it is very interesting. The ability to affect these scoring tracks get more and more expensive as the game progresses.

I'd play Noria again to see how everything holds up. It has some really neat ideas and didn't work real well in my one play. I'm unsure if that's because we didn't have all the rules quite right or it was our first play or it just doesn't work.

After one 3p game: Too long for what it is; surprisingly little depth. Choose which resources to produce, turn them into goods, turn in goods for points. The wheel building part is interesting at the start, but when it's done (around one third of the game) you mostly just play it out making minor modifications as necessary. It's a dry resource euro at heart, the theme doesn't seem important at all despite the nice art.

Can't stop wondering if I've missed something here and am willing to try again, but so far not impressed at all.

RATING: 6
Layered engine building with moving pieces. Somewhat like having three private Tzolk'in wheels in terms of timing your actions. Resource conversion used to upgrade engine and scoring tracks without the certainty which tracks will score the most; Also not unlike Tzolk'in. You want to upgrade early to be as efficient as possible, but also want to wait making investments to see which way scoring is headed.

Visually striking and a nice concept, but hard to play anywhere near proficiently in one play. [s]Provisional rating set to 7, since I'm not totally convinced of how the mechanics mesh.[/s] After three plays, the game begins to dawn on me, but that didn't make me love it more. In our last play scoring tracks evened out which takes away a layer, eventually degrading in a simpler push your cube euro. That's a pity. It seems the better you get at this, the more boring it becomes. It should be the other way around.

Note: At Spiel '17 where the game debuted, they provided thicker action tokens as an add-on. We played with the standard tokens and turning the wheels, especially the top one, was often a bit of a hassle as the wheel carton wiggled to much and the tokens got loose.

mI was totally in for this game just because it was designed by a woman. There are so few women designers on the hobbyist space (basically none) that I will literally buy any game if the designer is female. That said, after I saw the rules and did not think it was going to work out for me; it had the feel of a Feld game (arbitrary action restictions, cube-fiddling, point-salad-y) and I do not like that style of games. Fortunately though, it’s not like that at all and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The dial that you customize that governs your actions is actually not that restrictive and there are lots of interesting choices about how to do it; it feels much more like a deck-building game with less randomness than like the deeply problematic rondel game it superficially resembles, The dial is the heart of the game, and then the economic engine you’re building is easy to play and definitely not point salad-y.

Anyway, this was quite fun. I don’t know if it has a ton of replay; although the fiction is nice the gameplay lacks that much variation so it may end up feeling a little dry; I don’t know, we’ll have to see. Of the meaty new Games from Spiel ‘17, this was actually my favorite, and the first in the modern Feld/Rosenberg style of hobbyist games that I can see myself playing for a while and enjoying. Now just to see if other people will like it enough that I’ll get to play it :)

This is a gorgeous game, and the central wheel is going to catch your eye.  I'm usually a big fan of mechanics that are similar - I love Trajan, Tzolkin & Merlin.  And the wheel mechanic almost drove me.

That being said, the mechanics are very weird, and the art/setting is also very weird.  Which is a lot of weird to take in as a new player.  Also, for all of the gorgeous production values, the central scoring centers around an uninteresting stock market mechanic not nearly as interesting as the rest of the game. 

The game also seemed to be too long, and the group I was with seemed to encounter a ton of turn paralysis.  Hopefully, that's not the norm.

RATING: N/A
The "wheel programming" action-selection is what's getting all the attention, and I found it neat and interesting. But it was the scoring that pleasantly surprised me - I'd heard it described as dry / tacked-on / lackluster, but it's nicely brutal: all of your score is determined by 4 tracks. Each step on a track is worth a constant number of points - but that constant number is determined entirely and explicitly by player action, and can range between 24 at the highest end and 0 at the low. (There are 6 chambers to influence the value of: one per track, one for "best track" and one for "worst track".)

I suspect that knowing what's good to make score more/less requires more insight into the game-state than first or second-time players are likely to have, which makes it feel kind of arbitrary even though it's fully player-controlled. It looks like Noria would shine most with those who know the game well enough to make the scoring machinations better-informed.

Got a single play in with four players. The game is an interesting mix of building factories to produce goods, using those goods to go up in markets and also racing players to influence markets you're in while driving other markets down. The influence cubes (government officials) works to force players to be in some of the same markets and thus forces the interaction between players. While everyone else has raved about the wheel, I didn't feel that it was key to the game. The implementation of the wheel was hard to work with. Often times spinning the wheel would cause the action tokens to fall out of position. The action of tracing a line through the various action tokens was overly complex and difficult to explain. The tightness of the actions to pick from didn't seem any different than most worker placement games. Once you look past the gimmick of the wheel, the game is just an average economic market game with limited and changing actions.

Has some nice things going for it, but almost feels that it tries too hard to be clever, which is not uncommon for a first-time designer.   The wheels are the best part of the game in that they keep you focused and planning ahead.   They are also the worst part, in some sense, because they are super fiddly - the tokens are too small and they come disengaged while rotating.   The art is nice, but the board has some graphic design problems - again, too small text and almost invisible scoring values in the central column.   The rest of the game is a bit bland - gather resources, convert them into points.   For a game of this length, that aspect of the game needs to be better to make me want to come back to it often.   I'd play again with the advanced variations, but I don't think this game could become a long-term keeper for me.

Warum kleckern, wenn man klotzen kann? Vom Spieleautoren-Stipendium zum Expertenmonument: Deutschlands bekannteste Spielepraktikantin Sophia Wagner hat mit ihrem Erstlingswerk gleich einen Stein gemeisselt. NORIA ist genau der schwebende Brocken in der Luft, den Menzel und Lohausen malerisch wie zwei helle Arnold Böcklin eingefangen haben. Zudem hat die Dame nach dem Bag Building in ORLEANS eine neue Variante des Deckbuilding kreiert: they call it Wheel Building. Aus dem Schnupperkurs ist ein längerer Entwicklungsweg geworden an dessen ausgesuchtem Ende der Edition Spielwiese eine fliegende Steampunkinsel entstanden ist, die mit einer abgespeckten Spielzeit von 4h auf 2h immer noch gewichtig im Raum hängt. Man möchte nicht wissen, was da vor der Zeitdiät noch alles an Ebenen und Ideen dran hing. Allein schon das neue fummelige Dreifach-Aktionskarrussell ist ein Spinnrad unendlicher gedanklicher Möglichkeiten. AP Rotalarm! Andererseits wirken die Runden leicht repetitiv, man muss schon mehr oder weniger den gleichen infrastrukturellen Aufbau verfolgen, um hinten raus Erfolg zu haben: Ressourcen für Waren für Siegpunkte. Man merkt NORIA seine geowissenschaftlichen Roots an, Mathematiker sind klar im Vorteil, anarchische Elemente gibt es nicht. Das Herzblut, das Sophia Wagner in ihr Debüt gesteckt hat, verleiht der Kopfgeburt aber auch etwas Himmlisches und Seliges. Dazu passt die ruhige, lichte Spielatmosphäre der eigentümlichen Hirnkomposition mit bekannten Euro-Mechanismen. Schön schlank an NORIA ist der fehlende Punktesalat: sechs Tracks mit jeweils einem Multiplikator entscheiden über Sieg und Niederlage in der Wolkenstadt. Die gedanklichen Abwägungen und die Leistendynamik erinnern an die Leisten aus MOMBASA, wenngleich MOMBASA variantenreicher und die Leisten in NORIA kompetitiver sind. Timing ist hier das Thema: klettert man zu früh auf einer Leiste, drücken die Gegenspieler den Multiplikator, verpasst man den Zeitpunkt braucht man mehr Ressourcen um hochzukommen. NORIA hat einen naturwissenschaftlichen Grundton, der kreativ über den Wolken schwebt. Luftige Erde. Sophias Wagners Traum von der hauptberuflichen Spieleautorin startet mit einem Luftschloss als Fundament, das eine eigenwillige Gestalt angenommen hat.

Preliminary rating after one game. Solid and well crafted Euro Game with a unique and innovative wheel building mechanism. Victory-wise very focussed and not trashed with multi VP options, just four rows to climb multiplied with a variant rating. Good interaction between players, stressful in terms of collecting the needed infrastructure before others take it away. Some deep thinking needed and AP is possible, as everything is connected and each decision may have a pletoria of consequences. The background theme is a bit romantically and esthecically exaggerated compared to the brutal economic/mathematic nature of the game. Upgrading the wheel action tokens & turning the wheel a little bit fiddly, but ok. All in all good impression, needs to be played more with regards to finding winning strategies or tactics.

Bought at Essen 2017, played 2 times. 7 for now. 

I don't own LOTS of euro games so take my statement for that. I like this game! Lots of cool interesting decisions to make. The Wheel mechanism and the art is great, even though its not really integrated in the theme I feel like. 

This is not a solitaire game, the scoring board is very competitive and most decisions includes other players, I like this aspect of the game a lot. It is very satisfying to upgrade your wheel, like other "deckbuilders" 

Will definitely play it again a lot. I hope there will not be a dominant strategy cause I have the feeling that all the different path you could take might not be balance. But this will be part of the fun finding out. 

Downside: Playerturns are quite long since you play phase 1-4 all in once. Resources can be a bit fiddly (inyourhead)

Sajnos nem volt időnk kipróbálni Essenben, ezért a kinézet által megtévesztve vettük meg.

Kulcsin: Egy csomó számomra tetszetős grafikát pazaroltak el. Túl kicsi a méretük a tokeneken, ezért bár funkcionálisan oké a dolog - azt látod, hogy mit termelsz -, de pl. a szép kis steampunk hajók szinte nem is látszanak.

Szabaly: Én voltam az a szerencsés, aki elolvashatta a szabályt...
Igazából, ha egyszer átvergődik rajta az ember, akkor már nem nagyon kell később elővenni, de az első alkalom nem lesz kellemes.

Ertekeles: Szerettem volna szeretni a játékot, de nem sikerült: termelsz ezt-azt, sávokon lépkedsz és próbálod befolyásolni, hogy melyik mennyit ér a végén, de valahogy az egész túl hamar érdektelenné válik.

Another example of GORGEOUS cover art with emptiness inside. Was hyped before Essen, with the help of the cute chick that designed the game mechanics. 

Tried the game at Spellenspektakel Eindhoven 2017. Game was so bad everyone walked away during a turn. Manual incomprehensible. Too bad, islands  in the sky is my personal favorite fetish...
Lots of pieces, lots of wasted time, zero depth. Too bad, but the creator - the girl is hot.

So you thought you were playing at floating islands? Like that gamecube game, or La Puta? Well, in essence it is just a bad stock market game, where that over-designed wheel actually can be left out of noria, because it plays almost no role whatsoever.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

It is quite fiddly with lots of smallish pieces of cardboard and those who struggle with AP will have a challenge with this game as there is a fair bit to consider. I found both building the wheel which drives the actions for your game as well as the scoring system interesting but others may not enjoy the way others can put a crimp into what you want to score - don't show your hand too soon before making sure what you want to score will score fairly well. I do plan to pick this up at some point in the future.

- in 3 player games is always happens that 1 guy gets the shaft because the other 2 will combine a track and seriously lower the other one (2v1 style). 
- in 4 player games you can have serious kingmaking problems when there "stock" changing decisions will decide the winner.

Solid game, it seems. The wheel that you can build with various actions is something newish. But in essence it comes down to collecting resources and converting them into climbing steps on the 4 ladders to get you points. The ladders are just about the only area with some indirect interaction as you have to pay extra resources to the bank for each opponent that is higher on the ladder. Will play again, rating may go up or down. So far, it is an OK game, but it didn't live up to the hype.

The action wheel was really interesting. While I liked the theme, it was pretty pasted on and I really just felt like I was playing a game for VP's sake

RATING: 7
Noria is described as a "wheel-building" game. Each player has a set of three concentric wheels--the innermost can hold two action discs, the center can hold four, and the outer wheel holds six. Each turn, players move each of their wheels one position clockwise, and can activate three action slots that are "lined up", provided they are on the bottom half of the wheel. Throughout the game, players can gain new action discs to place on their wheels, move their action discs around, and flip the discs to their double-action side. Though the graphic design could've been improved to make it immediately obvious how far to rotate each wheel and which slots were lined up, I really enjoyed manipulating the wheel to further my strategy. However, I found the rest of the game, which mostly involved trading in goods to move up multiplier tracks, to be somewhat uninspired. Furthermore, I really didn't like being forced to limit other players' multipliers in order to increase my own--it seemed unnecessarily mean. I really wish this ingenious wheel mechanism was attached to a better game.

This was a hype at the Essen 2017-fair and I can understand why. Getting those gears work together is a real challenge and the scoring mechanism is also very nice. They are are multiple paths you can pursue.

My only comment I have on this game is that it's all a bit too small. I understand that making it bigger would clearly make the game more expensive, but it would have been better imho.

RATING: 7
This is a really enjoyable stocks game, where in order to buy your markers up the four investment tracks, you need to pay resources. Resources come in two varieties. Basic and advanced. Basic resources are gotten through upgradeable collection actions. Advanced resources require actions to build the matching warehouses and then further actions to supply those warehouses with the matching basic goods. The values of the various tracks can be manipulated through player actions, so watching what your opponents are setting up for, and then hurting the value of those tracks is crucial.

All this is fueled by this fantastic wheel based action system. Each player gets a dial with three rings. In those rings are little circular markers that determine what action happens when you activate that spot in the ring. Your turn is drawing an imaginary line from the central bottom action spot, and then can move one space to the left or right on the middle, and then again on the outside ring. Then you can resolve the actions you selected in any order. After your turn is over, all the rings rotate one position, which means the actions available to you is always changing and of course there are ways to spend resources and actions to further manipulate the wheel. 

There isn't a ton of variation to the game session to session. There are a few paths you can take in terms of which tracks you aim for, but the feel of all the tracks comes across as samey. The components aren't great. The cardboard discs you place in your wheel can get accidentally stuck under the wheel piece when it rotates if you aren't careful, which can get annoying. The iconography isn't bad, but it isn't great. For example, the most important number in the game, which is the number that determines your score multiplier on each of the stock tracks is really hard to see against the background art, and there's a track that can be bumped by spending some number of like or unalike resources, but when it says 3 different, what it means is 2 different and one of any, not one of each of all three. I would say the readability of the board is manageable but not great.

All this being said, I do like this game. I like stocks fueled by resource management, and I like manipulating the wheel.

[u]The positive:[/u]
:) [b]Nice illustrations[/b]

:) The [b]action disks offer a new twist of limiting possible actions. It successfully creates a small puzzle which invites players to plan ahead strategically, but offers enough flexibility during the course of the game.[/b] Initially, this innovative action selection systems is Noria's biggest asset, but unfortunately during the course of the game the effect of this disk diminishes (see the negative points).

:) There are some [b]opportunities for engine building[/b] in updating your action disks, getting resource ships in order to increase output and getting factories out in order to increase your knowledge income. I like those aspects as they give you the feeling of growth and accomplishment.

:) The game [b]plays rather quickly[/b] in about 30 min / player.

[u]The negative:[/u]
:soblue: To me, the mechanical core of a game is the [b]engine that drives point scoring[/b]. Unfortunately, I find this aspect in Noria [b]pretty uninteresting[/b]. You solely score points by climbing 4 different (political) tracks in which every track is scored end game by a variable multiplier. About midgame through most of these multipliers will have become fixed numbers and the game basically boils down to very simple calculus (one step on track A accounts for 6 points, a step on track B accounts for 9 points, etc).

:soblue: [b]Player interaction is pretty blunt[/b] in Noria. There is little player interaction as players are pretty preoccupied with their own action disk, which is not very 'transparent' to opponents. The player interaction is generally limited to pretty direct negative ('take that!') player interaction: increasing a multiplier on one of the victory tracks forces players to permanently decrease the potential of other tracks. Yes, there is some very limited opportunity for two players working toghether to increase the value of one of their tracks, but directly breaking down on the scoring potential of opponents in such a direct way is pretty unelegant in my opinion and you can expect equally direct and simple retalliation (because opponents can simply respond by doing exactly the same to you as this doesn't require much careful planning or setting up).

:soblue: Previous 2 negative points lead to a pretty chaotic evaluation of the 4 victory tracks during the course of the game, especially when playing with 4 players. [b]Players have limited control[/b] over how much each of the tracks will be worth at the end of the game.

:soblue: In the second half of the game, you can expect the multipliers of most victory tracks to have become fixed. At that time, the knowledge tokens which are required to manipulate the multipliers, will be overflowing the game. A second function of these tokens is that they allow you to manipulate your action disk, and their abundance breaks down on the biggest assest Noria offers: the strategic planning of your actions. [b]With enough knowledge you can basically take whatever actions you want despite your disk, negating this interesting mechanical twist.[/b]

:soblue: Despite the nice illustrations, there is little to no integration between theme and mechanics: [b]the mechanics don't tell a story and what you do in the game makes no thematic sense.[/b] This basically is a beautifully drawn but mechanically somewhat abstract game of taking resources and spending them again in order to increase in one of the four victory tracks.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
All in all, I was disappointed in Noria. I feel there was real potential here with the introduction of the action disks which offered a new type of puzzle to strategically plan your actions. This mechanic works well, especially coupled with some engine building opportunities, but unfortunately the rest of the game is not interesting enough to keep everything together. The way points are scored boils down to a race aspect in which every step in 4 different tracks will be worth more or less points at the end of the game. There are other games with similar simple scoring mechanics, but Noria doesn't create an interesting path which players have to discover in order to score: it all is pretty blunt and straight forward: generate resources and spend them in order to score. The game is also pretty blunt as it comes to player interaction: there is little in this game, and the interaction that is offered more often than not are pretty direct negative 'take that'-style actions. To make matters worse, the most interesting aspect of the game: strategic planning using your action disks coupled with improving your engine, risks falling flat well before the game is over, making the finale pretty uninteresting.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Think how you build your starting action disks. Powerful actions you plan to use frequently throughout the game (like travel actions or town actions) are usefull to put in your small disk, so they are available at least 50% of the time.
(*) Build up a strong engine initially by taking resource ships. Focus on the resources you will need most by examining the victory point tracks you have set your mind to.
(*) Get at least one factory out early so you can build up some knowledge, you will need this to participate in the political action of manipulating the multipliers
(*) When there is a shortage of certain machines, this could be an opportunity to gain a less contested headstart on one of the machine-victory tracks, unless other players break down on that scoring potential of course...

I bought this game today and played it already two times with the solo mode - yes, i am a solo baordgamer, that was also the reason for buying this game. First of all i want to mention, that i was not so overwhelming when i saw the first pictures of this game before i bought it ... the artwork is great no question, but the theme is not so mine ... and i thought that the wheels are more fragmented then innovative ... but after two times playing i was suprised about the game - it is a brainburner and you have to think a lot if you want to play good and to have a change against the bot - the first bot level is already very tricky ... the wheel is not a must-have for me ... normally i dont like such "special" things in games ... but in this game it works very well ... i had no problem with handling the wheels. The biggest surprise for me is the very liquid and easy handling of the bot in the solo mode ... the effort to manage the actions are really minimal and quick. The game is hard ... when you just play without a strategy than you will not have a change to win ... the rules were very clear after reading them two times. 

In my opinion Sophia Wagner is very talented and creative ... and this was her first game in this business, dont forget that. I would recommend it :)

Positive/negative summary:
+tricky and complex
+good solo mode
+first game of Sophia
+understandable rules
+wheels (i dont need it but they are special and work)

-i dont like the small round tokens
-the ressource tokens for the wheels would be cooler if they were wooden disks
-its more abstract then thematic

Interesting twist on the deck building genre, where you are building a dial system that helps you gather resources. Quality components and great art work, but lack of theme hurts it for me. Mostly solitare play with some interaction on the scoring track that is a little bit of area control. I like it, but probably wont play it unless asked to.

l;dr: interesting engine builder

This game has a new, eye catching mechanism at it's core. 3 dials that can contain action tokens. The dials will rotate giving you access to certain actions at certain times. Of course you can change the actions and influence the position of the wheel. So that definitely gets lots of people interested. I must admit I got this game without really looking into it and only became aware of this when reading the rules.
In any case. The actions let you get more, upgrade, get resources, convert stuff into points... The usual stuff but all executed in a quite refreshing way. And it all fits together quite nicely.
The scoring happens on a number of different tracks with a mechanism that itself is also quite interesting. Players can influence what tracks will have what multiplier and such. Some are more expensive and harder to move up on, but they also score more.
All in all a well put together game with lots of new and different stuff. Quite an impressive debut!

Essen 2017. First playthrough with 4… didn’t like this enough to be motivated to play again. The wheel certainly is innovative, and the way scoring works can be harsh. You either love it or hate it. Doesn’t seem to go over well with carebears. The art is ok, the game looks great on the table, but somehow I didn’t feel the click between the mechanics, the theme and the art. Generally speaking I’m just not very fond of games in which you gather resources, convert those into other things that you need to do other things with. Rince and repeat. That could explain why this doesn’t feel like a hit for me. I should try it again though for a deeper understanding...

Just having one interesting new mechanism would be fine, except that the rest of the game is SO dull and there isn't even much interesting interaction between the parts. To make matters worse it goes on much too long.

A good comparison is Otys, which came out around the same time and also features a cool central mechanism with some very standard stuff around it. It succeeds much better than Noria because the mechanisms affect each other more and is much shorter - half the time or less.

Noria got unfairly panned mostly cause it wasn't what people expected, and partly cause it really isn't good with 2.

The game combines a stockholding element (players score endgame VP for their advancement on four tracks but during the game can do things to help/hinder the value of those tracks) and deck (or in this case wheel) building. The beauty of the wheel beyond its novelty is that it's completely deterministic: you customize your wheel with different actions and they become available/unavailable to you as the three gears on your wheel rotate in predictable fashion.

The beauty of the combination of these two mechanics is that you can construct a highly specialized wheel but other players might then trash the value of the track you're gearing for (no pun intended). I really like that despite the self-absorbed tooling of your wheel, the player-driven scoring keeps your head up evaluating your opponents' engine and motivations. 



We went straight to the expert setup; no reason to bother with the basic setup IMHO.

Steampunk floating trade empire representatives in a stock and industry engine builder.  Driven by and featuring a 3-D action "wheel builder" comprised of 3 rotating concentric wheels. Collect and convert energy, mycelium and obsidium into goods such as pistons, sails, and propellers.  Contribute these goods to the empire to advance on the scoring tracks where the final value is adjusted by spending knowledge to bribe the politicians.  Travel to neighboring empires to place ambassadors, build factories, and gain additional resource ships. The essence of the game is customizing the action wheel in tandem with your resource and goods conversion investments while not ignoring the need to stay ahead in influencing politicians.  The action wheel building is a novel mechanism to deliver an otherwise familiar stock value and engine builder.

There’s some interesting gameplay here. But overall, the real standout was the action selection wheel/mechanism. While that’s, the engine building, and the endgame scoring are interesting, I’m not certain the action selection mechanism makes this a real standout. As is, it’s a nice game in an ocean of nice games. I don’t see adding this to my collection but wouldn’t say no if someone brought it over and wanted to play it.

Very nice engine building and resource management game. Only played with 2 players and feel it would be more interesting with more as there would be more variation and players actions affecting others more.
Interesting wheel mechanism for action selection and the game is fun trying to get the most out of it. I kind of feel it's a bit Stefan Feld like in the way you have multiple ways to achieve points. Ultimately not sure about longevity and feel I have played similar games (not necessarily better though) but would like to play again. Not sure about the £50ish price tag though.

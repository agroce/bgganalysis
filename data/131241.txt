Great Eurogame with nice theme and mechanics, easy to play, but with a lot of important decisions in an hour. Works really well, very good design. Must have

Gran Eurogame con buen tema y mecánica, fácil de jugar, pero con un montón de decisiones importantes en una hora. Funciona muy bien, muy buen diseño. Un imprescindible.

PD: A mi se me hace demasiado corto, quizá un turno más le iría bien.

One of the best surprises in Essen 2014 was playing a prototype of Oilfield during one evening after the show. Very simple in understanding, interaction with others in each round through secret actions and good offer of the strategic decisions thanks to different ways how to gain points. Very promising!

Great Euro style game, with a nice theme and great looks.
Fun to play and easy to grasp.
Completely recommendable!

Wanted to like this - almost something good from a first-time designer. But there seems like there is a serious problem with the turn order mechanic; being first on turn 1 is pretty huge and there is no balance for being late in the turn order early (especially with 5p, where being 5th is brutal). Upside is that it plays fast, downside is that there isn't a ton going on. Not recommended.

I enjoyed it. It didn't grip me so I don't ever need or expect to play it again but was happy to play it once.

An interesting game, although in my one play it felt quite repetitive. Making early mistakes may get you out of the game well before the final round. And the "strike" cube is the single most stupid idea I've evern seen in a boardgame.

Euro medio de una hora aprox de duración. Muchas opciones para conseguir puntos y mucha interacción entre jugadores. Fácil de jugar pero con profundidad para tomar decisiones. Las mecanicas muy bien engranadas con el tema. Totalmente recomendado si te gustan los euros de peso y duración media. Deseando jugarlo otra vez.

A pretty good worker placement/Euro game.  Enjoyed the strategy involved.  I will not play without the National goods and advanced tokens.  Some clunky rules (but it could just be a translation issue).  Overall, well done!

Solido e ben rodato, scivola via fin troppo velocemente, fluido e inafferrabile. Lasciando, dietro di sé, l'impressione d'aver perso l'opportunità (da qualche parte e in qualche modo) di poterlo giocar meglio.

RATING: 8.5
Light eurogame about oil extraction and trade. It achieves a nice equilibrium between interesting decisions and low complexity, being great as a gateway game.

PROS
- It is fairly easy to teach and understand for casual gamers (maybe still too much for total newbies).
- It has a classical feeling, with the interest laying not on the mechanics, but on player's decisions.

CONS
- Probably too light to be the main game for people who is used to eurogames.

Picked it up at Essen on a whim. Played 3 times.

Positives
+ The game is rather quick and easy to learn
+ Drilling oil mechanism fits the theme

Major negatives
- Not much replay-ability. The game is rather repetitive.
- First player mechanism seems clunky
- Very little player interaction (but I guess this is common for all euros)

Minor negatives:
- Rulebook is very awkward to use with both Spanish and English version together. Have no idea why it wasn't split in two.
- Box and board design could be better. Even the wood texture on the board is blurred and low res.

It was ok for a couple of plays, but the enjoyment dropped with every game.
I don't think we'll play this again.

P.S:
I`m not a fan of dry Euros in general, so if you like them, you might like this one more than I did.

Gioco molto interessante, semplice ma non banale. Gioco stretto, quasi asfittico con poche scelte strategiche ma ugualmente sempre diverso. Le partite evolvono in maniera molto differente le une dalle altre. Il gioco potrebbe non piacere per la sua quasi eccessiva linearità, al contrario risulta molto tattico e paradossalmente anche ben ambientato. A me ha fatto un'ottima impressione e una partita, che di solito dura poco più di un'ora, la gioco sempre volentieri.

Yet another example of a game that has not been adequately honed.  The buildings display can become blocked with buildings players either do not want or cannot afford.  The need to have a lease before buying a building restricts options unnecessarily.  Not being allowed to over build a building also seems unnecessary.  The sum result is that on some occasions you have little useful to do.  Also I do not like that you can choose an action even if you cannot do the action or choose not to do so just to mess others up.

Great euro, but need more polish.
Unbalanced oil drill and single way to win on prototype.

RATING: 7
This is a very solid design. It all integrates logically and is therefore easy to explain. The only minus for me is that it seems to be designed so that scores will be very close together, which makes that one player can sometimes decide who will win the game (like for instance by taking away the majority of money from an other player).

tl;dr: solid euro

Yes! Yet another worker placement game! I can never have too many of those :)
This one has a bunch of actions and a different amount of available slots for each one of those. And some of them cost extra. This leads to some nice choices to be made. Especially since it combines that with a simultaneous action selection where the outcome is influenced by how many choose a particular action.
There's also choices as to where to develop oil rigs, where to mine oil and gas, when to sell those...
And this all combines nicely into a game that doesn't take too long and plays at a pleasant pace.
Yes, all in all this is a solid euro. It uses the ingredients to very good effect. But in the end it didn't stand out to me either. It's just a well put together package.

Initial rating: 6.8/10

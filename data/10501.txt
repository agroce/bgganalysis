THis looks like the coolest WWI flying game ever, and it's free!  Seems perfect for someone who is obsessed with WWI planes, which I am not, and do not know anyone who is.  THis fine printout shall remain on my shelf unplayed until I die, I am sure.  Even then it won't be played.

This game is amazing. The high you get after taking down an opponent is unbelievable! 

Seriously gives me goosebumps.

RATING: 5
The romance of WWI dogfighting, and the cool minatures people bring to the table, keep me willing to try, but ultimately this doesn't do a lot for me.  Because the planes are slow it's hard to catch anyone.  Because the table is small, people have to turn a lot.  So if you just kinda hang back and wait for some fool to fly in front of you, you can blast him.  Which is neither realistic nor fun.

WW1 dogfighting perfection.  You'll leave the game feeling like you just piloted a bi-plane. Needs a bit of an investment to get a good set together, but well worth it.  Some of my best gaming memories - see my avatar....

Probably the best and fastest playing WWI air combat game ever designed.  Play for 3 hours with players who have played before and you will play between 35 and 50 turns.  Fast action, furious and a lot of fun.  Play in 3D using antenna stands and you will wonder why you bothered playing anything else -- very addictive game.  Once you play it, you will be looking forward to the next time you can play.  Playing a game with 18 or more players still produces a very fast playing game.  Adults and kids love this one.  I have taught 8 year olds to play and they love the game, as do adults.  Easily my favorite game of all time.

I used Wings of War minis. I mounted using telescoping inspection mirrors from Harbor Freight. To attach the planes I cut 1/4" section of RC fuel tubing, it fits snug and still allows minis to be used with WoW. For the stands I cut circles from plywood, weighted down with inset pennies, and covered with cardstock paper (plane number and direction). I made a map using 4-quadfold thrift boards and a jigsaw cut to hold them all together (see gallery). It works well, now I just need to get some more players.

This is NOT a board game and ownership of miniatures and a hex printed game map is required.

That said, this is a good free game that covers WWI aerial combat that can be taught to children at a convention.  This game flows fairly quickly, is relatively popular (it is free).

What this game lacks (for people like me) is detail, realism and thus how tactics are used in the game.  Several mechanics in this game are entirely un-realistic and several other aspects critical to aerial combat are completely left out.

This game will (IMO) never satisfy a "wargamer" who has read a fair amount of first person accounts on this type of warfare as it just "falls short" and key issues in the game are simply fantasy and never existed in reality (ex: the entire "fuel consumption" section is contrived fantasy, yet drives much of the tactics of this game).

RATING: 2
I think biplanes had more loiter time than Me-263s.

I think biplanes had less structure than B-17s.

I think the relative speed of head-on attacks effect each pilot equally.

Therefore, this game and I do not match.

It was a lot of fun. It was only me and another person, but I can see myself wanting to play this one again and again. And I want more and more planes.

RATING: 9.5
Tactical WWI Air Combat game.  System is 90% Blue Max, 10% enhancements, which includes altitude.  Rules are freely available off several web sites.

Easy to learn and fast playing (simultaneous moves).

1-player per plane.

Game can be played using counters, but looks much better with 1/72nd scale model planes mounted on an antena stand (see photo gallery) especially when on fire or smoking!!

All maneuvers available to your plane are listed graphically, so you can visualize where your plane will be at the end of the turn, as well as which facing it will have.  Since movement is simultaneous, you need to estimate where your target will go, and try to get your plane into firing position!

Hosted CE games for the Ottawa Canvas Eagles Group from 2001 to 2004.

In order to enhance our campaign game, I created, in 2003, an Operational Level Campaign System, which was used to port all tactical combat to the CE table.  Planes, pilots, location, formation and surprise provided an added level of excitement in our games.

Fast paced and interesting engineering progress through 1915-1918.  Survival rate is low, goes to show the folly of war heroics.  It remains safer to play the stuntman on the board.

This "aerial chess" game is quickly learned and played.  Campaign model found at http://canvaseagles.diplomacy.ca/  adds depth to a completely tactical, skirmish playing experience.  With this being said, it really is all about shooting down aircraft; GLORIOUS!

This is the single best 'free' game that I own. Not only that but it has the distinction of being my gaming groups most played game (by far). Simple rules for movement coupled with a Hotz Mat, Wing of War miniatures and telescoping rods and you've got yourself a wicked-quick game of simultaneous movement.

Love it!

Looked into this after playing "Check Your Six", a WWII variant of the core rules system.  The aircraft display sheets make damage tracking a breeze and the game has the right "feel" for a playable air to air combat game - note, I said "playable".  One doesn't spend the entire gaming session chasing an opponent to get in one shot nor kill legions of brain cells figuring out how the aircraft should maneuver on the table.  If you like this, look into the "Crimson Skies" variant of the same core system.  All three games rock....

A more detailed version of Blue Max. Recommended for experienced Blue Max players. I recommend using "Blue Max" rather than "Canvas Eagles" when introducing the WW1 aircraft combat to new players and/or gamers. Especially if they haven't played a game like this before.

An improved version of an already strong hex-and-counter air combat game (Blue Max). Adds altitude, tons of aircraft, minimal complexity. Was happy to get as a free print-and-play when looking for something a little more crunchy Wings of War. Still using the excellent Wings minis. With more plays, the rating may go up.

I started building this game in 2012. Carved/painted my own miniatures. Cut up Trivial Pursuit boards and glued aerial photo with hexes to them. I like the game well enough and it has potential. But introducing it to friends hasn't really worked out.

However, my wife bought me Wings of War: Famous Aces for my birthday. It is much easier to get on the table with my gaming friends, so I will likely not be playing Canvas Eagles again. 

Reduced my original rating due to difficulty getting others to play.

I have built about 15-20 1/72 WWI models for this game.  If I didn't like it, I certainly wouldn't have spent the time putting the things together! I find this game to have a good balance between simulation and playability.  The variety of aircraft and the differences between them really adds a nice level of depth to the system with becoming burdensome.

While the game is free, I have noted that I own it because of the time and effort (not to mention $) I have put into it.  In this case owning means having the means to play.

Świetna gra o walkach powietrznych w trakcie I Wojny Światowej (są klony na II WŚ). Jedyny mankament, to brak uwzględnienia doświadczenia pilotów i stąd dobry gracz w 99% starć wygra z niedoświadczonym pomimo dużej różnicy w jakości samolotów itp. Gdyby nie ten mankament byłaby 10.

Best to play as two sides just counting the difference in score between them each round until a total of 50 is reached.  This is a great game that plays fast. It seems there's been a constant game going at our weekly game night for two months now with revolving players! 
Lots of strategic efforts in trying to place the dice where they can be knocked down later, or used to block an earlier throw. Then sometimes it's time to bring out the Hammer and make a last desperation throw at a gaggle of dice trying to knock them helter-skelter.

Just as it sets out to do, Tumblin-Dice is dexterity magic. Nothing could be easier in explanation and more approachable in play. Toss the dice out, try to bump yours down, make it to the 4X spot - or just bump your opponents off. It has all the charm it needs combined with great production. Loads of fun for sure, but nearly impossible to buy because the price point is outrageous. Make me almost want to build my own.

Ferti version (French). Bought March 2010.

RATING: 8
This game is rediculously fun, either 1 on 1, or 2 on 2 teams.  

Recommended scoring:  Whichever team gets the most points scores the difference in the two teams' point totals.  This is the score for the round.  First to 50 wins the match.

I want to also point out that there is a significant amount of skill in this game, and there is even some strategy to it (just as curling has strategy), and you can do things like set up several dice near the end of the 1x area, and then cascade them down with future dice.  Due to being lightly tapped over instead of thrown, they will not go past the end.  You can also cascade down low numbers and not cascade down your low numbers.  You can also get a large probability of a 6 on the 1x area by placing the die, 6 face up, on the start area, and gently sliding it off.  These are excellent as blockers for your dice that have gone further down.

RATING: 8.5
This game is the crazy love child of some weird combination of shuffleboard, crokinole and a bag of dice. The game is almost complete randomness but it sure is a lot of fun. Set it up on a game night off to the side and just leave it up all night and it's sure to get lots of play in between the 'real' games (whatever that means to you). It's also the perfect game for gatherings of family and friends where you'll have lots of nongamers. Everyone instinctively knows how to play just by looking at the game and anyone from young kids to seniors will have just as much fun tumblin' dice.

{many plays, 2-4 players} Good thing I didn't rate this right away, because I wasn't that impressed with this one at first.  But now, after we all got a little better at it, it's kind of genius.  If you're skilled at the flicking dexterity games, then you will *probably* win this more than you'll lose, however - and in that "however" lies the genius - if your dice don't come 4s, 5s, or 6s, or, more importantly, if the "lucky" players do get an occasional 5 or 6 on those 3x or 4x levels, well... everyone has a chance.  Plus, it's just so damn satisfying when your die tumbles down to the bottom levels, manages to stay on the board, and is a 6.  Addictive.

More fun than it should be.  A nice light party game without a bunch of thinking.  But man do I like throwing dice around.  One of the best fillers around for group events.  People can walk up and start playing without 15 minutes of instruction.A nice party game, you can explain the rules in 5 minutes.  It comes with dice for 4, but you can buy additional dice to expand the game.You know that it's a good game when you've played it for a while and then you put it away to play another game and then you hear the clatter of dice because some of the other players decided to take it out and play it again.  One friend says that every bar in Portland should have one and he's right

This is stupid. It's almost nothing but random, you really don't control on which side your dice will end and you barely can control the direction it will go. It's still fun to play but it is the worse flicking game I have played so far. 

If you want a serious dexterity game get Carrom. If you want a party dexterity game get Crokinole.

One of the great things about this game is that it is so easy to teach. Anyone can figure this game out in no time. It's a dexterity game, so it seems like you need some skill to play. But this skill is easily picked up with just a few practice rolls. And since there's dice involved, even if your dice land in the right place, you may not get the good of a score. So new players can play with experienced players and still be competitive.

Great dexterity game that is equally fun for adults as it is for kids, IMO. And now back in print! You can really get good at this with practice. My 9 year old routinely wallops me at this. But if you get the 6 face up in the X4 scoring area, it is just awesome! A blast of a game.

I've always been spoiled by my BGG Secret Santas, but my 2011 Santa raised the bar so high I don't envy those who have to follow his act. Santa custom-made a copy of this game for me. Wow, It is absolutely beautiful! The gameplay is so simple and yet so fun. It really takes some skill to shoot those dice down the board at a speed that is fast enough to get to the points, but slow enough so that it won't roll off the end. And my Secret Santa went the extra mile and made the board so you can have a ton of different setups, and even add extra 12 or 20-sided dice. Which is great because it really has that awesome "let's play again!" feel to it. A couple of us even decided that we liked this game more than Pitchcar, because it gives you the opportunity to make a big come-from-behind push in any round. Few dexterity games pack this much fun in such a simple package.  And I doubt anyone has a copy of this game better than mine.

Thank You Secret Santa 2011!!

Great game, I like playing with 4 teams/players more than 2 teams/players because if one person has a 6 on the 4x, the other 3 can team up on them and it lessens the point runaway, not to mention the fun of 3 players flicking as hard as they can for the sole purpose of knocking them off. :)

Remember to use furniture polish, but not too much!

Add a lazy susan for ultimate laziness.

Some strategic scoring I thought up but have not tried: 
1. Players bring any sided dice they wish, as long as they are equally sided. The more round 20 sided dice has more of a chance to fall off the board but if it sticks the points are more worthwhile.
2. Using writable 6 sided dice players mark their own numbers to a total of say, 14 'dice points' dice marked 1-6 would be worth 3.5 'dice points'(average between 1 and 6) Or players could mark a die with all 14's or 7 dice with half 2's half 1's.

RATING: 8
Cool game.  Has an nice amount of skill for a dexterity game.  But still has a good amount of luck to give the, uh, non-dexterous players a chance to win.

So much fun!!!  Very easy to convince non-gamers to try this.  One of the few games that I'm happy to play 3 consecutive full games of (because it's still over in an hour).  Brennan and I changed the rule for 2-player games so that the leader from the previous round has to roll ALL of his dice before the next highest scoring player rolls ALL of his dice.  This seems to enable "catch up" a little better and allows for more "strategy".

Juego de habilidad, estilo crockinole. Hay una rampa con varias alturas y anchuras, y el jugador tiene que lanzar unos dados, al estilo de chapas, para dejar el dado lo mejor ubicado posible. 
Cada altura multiplica el valor del dado por un factor. Tienen ventaja los jugadores que juegan más tarde, puesto que es menos probable que desplacen o saquen del tablero sus dados.
Es muy rápido y divertido. De madera. Y no es plegable. Es un armatoste bueno.

Very disappointing game: expensive, heavy, very bulky, the dexterity element is not that interesting. I would put almost all other dexterity games we have ahead of it.

There are so many better alternatives that I do not recommend it.

A straight up fun dexterity game that is easy to get to the table.  The box sucks but the game is extremely enjoyable and addictive.

----------------------------

Picked up the new 2015 EG reprint:
This board is not quite as good but you can't beat the price.  Still plays extremely fun.

This is certainly a top-tier dexterity game, just edging out Pitchcar, Rampage, and Sorry! Sliders.  It stands among Coconuts and Tic-Toc Woodsman as the most prolific.

My 2015 set is now starting to bow on one of the sections which is causing it not to seat properly.  Frustrated but it still plays OK.

Simple fun dice flicking game trying to get your dice to the best scring spot and hoping they land on the biggest number.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun dexterity game that fills a nice niche with its quickness. The board is wonderful - the way the dice glide across the smooth surface is extremely satisfying.

I'm not really sure how much strategy there is here yet, but there's enough thought that goes into your turn-to-turn plays to keep you engaged. Victory comes in large swings, which keeps the game super exciting, but in a longer game would probably feel unfair. As-is though, it feels pretty good.

The version I have claims to go to six players but seems to have only come with enough dice for four, which is odd. Still, I see no reason this couldn't be played with more by just grabbing some spare D6s.

The rulebook is also weirdly vague. You would think a game this simple wouldn't need to say much, but there's just a few odd missing bits (if a die lands on the line between the 1 and -1, what's the call?).

It's a hard game to recommend to other people though due to the price. I feel like for most people, Crokinole has more longevity and satisfying skill to master for around the same price point, or PitchCar + expansions is probably a better investment for a party dex game, but this is really not a game I'd ever turn down playing.

Update (Important): With the addition of alcohol, this game induces all the high-fiving, cheering, jeering, and excited gasps of a good game of PitchCar. Impressive.

Initial rating an 8. I'm surprised. I love Crokinole, and regret that I don't play it enough. So, when my wife gave Tumblin' Dice the thumbs up, I wasn't sure. It looks fun, but would it be too random? Would it pale in comparison to the "mad skillz" that crokinole demands?

I'm struck by the fact that both are very legit and fun games...for those two specific reasons. Want to hone your flickin' chops? Play crokinole. But, want to have simple fun with some of your less dextrous friends? Play Tumblin' Dice. There's certainly skill that's still involved. But the randomness of the die face means that luck will sometimes triumph... and that's OK.

Now, if I ever learn how to get the die to consistently land on six, it's a different story...

Hey, I got a copy of Tumblin' Dice.  It's well made, big, and assembles easily.  I played it with my younger kids and they were entertained but not whipped into a frenzy or anything.  I took it last night over to friends, and with four adults playing teams it was pretty fun, with people laughing and pretty engaged.  I bet it gets played as a drinking game.

Pros: lots of fun with the right crowd and can play with many people.  No learning curve

Cons: big, harder to haul around, and lots of randomness, although skill comes into play as you improve

 Although I like it, I think I like Crokinole more and may sell this and get a high quality crokinole board that I can hang in the front room.  Crokinole provides more control and is sort of soothing to play, and still supports four.  On the other hand, TD is a game that could come out at every large family gathering with good results.

update: I played this with seven family members at once, using teams.  They ranged in age from 2-77 (seriously!) and everyone had a great time.  No other game can accomodate that range of people and ages, so I'm holding onto it.

Saw this on BGG and had to have it.  $70 amazon purchase later and it's the best thing I have ever bought on that site.  I cannot get enough dice tumbling.  SO GOOD!!!  Better than cable television.
I found a 5th set of dice - same size, same weight.  MORE game on!!!
It's pretty crazy how good you can get at this game.  And I'm an old school tumbler, not one of these new fool "dice flickers".  It's called Tumblin' Dice, not "flicking" dice.

Purchased this because my family fell in love with the Jr. edition.  Same fun game in concept, BUT I'm a bit disappointed in the surface finish of the Gryphon Games edition.  While the surface of the Jr. edition (produced by Nash) is nice and smooth, this Gryphon edition has a glossy laminate surface that creates much more friction which completely changes the "feel" of the game.  Perhaps it's just personal preference, but I'll take the smoother, quicker surface any day.  
Would probably rate this an 8, but the game just didn't feel as fun with the surface issues.
Edit:  Added carrom powder (too slick) then wiped it off - after wiping, the surface was just slick enough.

[b]White Elephant - Christmas 2012[/b] 
We procured this game at a White Elephant exchange.  It is by far the BEST white elephant gift we've received.  The box is HUGE!  The mechanics is sliding the dice down the wooden levels.  Each level is smaller and added a multiplier to the pips on the dice (x2, x3, and x4).  It much like shuffleboard, but with dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
This game felt to me like a nicer version of Sorry! Sliders, adding in vertical height and the ease of dice.  It's a simple dexterity game with loads of chance and loads of fun.

The simple rules - shoot your dice down the line, and the value when it lands is multiplied by the number of that level.  But other players might knock your dice out of the way, so only the final resting places count.

I would give this game an extra point if I was playing on the beautiful custom-made board that my brother owns!

Try before you buy. One of the worst cases of "buyer's remorse" I've had was after buying this game. I love crokinole and thought this would be as fun, but it's not even close.

Has been a HUGE hit with my family and church. A little pricey -- and getting more so as stock disappears -- but worth every penny.

It's a perfect 10. I always want to play it and everywhere I bring it, everyone wants to play too. I own the newer edition by Eagle Gryphon and purchased 4 additional sets of dice. I wanted to knock it a point for being a big box but really, how do you blame a game for its positive attributes?

Extra dice: Purple, Bronze, Pink, Orange plus Purple Pummeler

Just plain fun. Great to play with my 8 year old son and fun as a midgame filler on game nights. Sure it isn't as "skills based" as crokinole, but landing that perfect shot on the 4x and knocking someone else off is just fun...even if your dice face is a 1. Find a Nash board is you can...the quality is far superior to the Ferti boards (and the Eagle boards don't even deserve a mention).

The perfect chance to make a comment about rubrics. If I had a standard mathematic equation to rate games, Tumblin-Dice would hardly get a 3.

Well, this is a fun little filler. You throw or flick your dice onto a board, hoping that they'll land on the right side and point multiplier. Furthermore, you can try to flick someone elses die from the board and deny them the points.

Easy to learn and light fun. Nothing I need to own.

EXCELLENT DEXTERITY GAME COMBINING LUCK AND SKILL
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I made my own version and deliberately reduced the amount of luck in the design. My rating is for the concept of chucking dice down steps, not the store bought product.

Also, we always play with my Bomb Dice variant.*

As such, it's the best dexterity game I've played. Maybe not quite as skill-based as Crokinole but consistently more exciting from match to match. Rating is based on how much it makes people yell, fist-pump and trash talk. Love it.


Built with precut 22" poplar 'hobby' boards from Home Depot. Widths, from top step to bottom: 3", 12", 7", 5", 3"

*Bomb die is a d12. After each player has rolled their 4 d6's, they roll their d12 twice, shooting it the second time from where it stopped after the first roll. The number on the d12 has no effect; the bomb is solely used to knock opponents' d6's off or to advance one's own.

Players are trying to score points but tumbling dice down a staircase game board.  Simple party game where players take turns flicking a die off the top tier of a four step staircase.  The idea is to stop the die somewhere on the structure, where it will score points equal to it's die face times it's resting level - ideally 6 x 4 = 24 points.  Players alternate rolling dice, so you can get knocked off by skillful players.  Sum the scores at the end of each round, play four rounds, then go play again.  Addictive, but large game.

Very high in the "fun factor" department.  You can definitely get lucky by rolling 5's & 6's in the high numbered steps but you also become a target for others to bump you off.  The dice often do crazy things causing lots of commotion.  ***Holding up extremely well after 10 plays- everyone who has played seems to enjoy it quite a bit.  Like my Crokinole (Crokinole is much more of a skill game, so don't expect Tumblin Dice to provide that sort of dexterity satisfaction) board, I don't see this ever leaving my collection.

Strange in that it makes a good party (read: alcohol consumption) game for adults as well as a great educational game for children. For kids the dexterity element is combined with addition and multiplication needed for scoring. This game has my kindergartner racking her brain trying to figure out (4x6)+(3x2)+(3x1)+(2x4). It is a bit out of her reach at this age, but the fact that she will try is a great credit to this game.

Tumblin-Dice is the kind of dexterity game I didn't know I needed until it was sitting on my table after my wife and I had played 3 games in a row. We've been doing the 10x10 challenge this year (a difficult task for us since I'm a bit of a collector and struggle with cult of the new)and this is easily the quickest we've gone from 0 to 10 games.

Sure, each game is short, but who cares? It's fun.

It's quick, it's easy, and there's a solid mix of luck and skill to it making it incredibly accessible.

There's not much strategy beyond trying to get better at rolling dice, and the fact that a superior tosser/flicker/pusher can be beaten by bad die results can be frustrating.

This isn't an essential buy in any way, but as someone who likes to entertain guests and finds himself frequently teaching games to individuals new to the hobby, this hits just the right spot for me.

About the only thing I don't like is that the construction quality appears to be lacking in the version I own. I'll likely end up replacing this with a custom built version at some point in time.

The big fun of this game comes from dice hurtling into other dice, knocking them into different parts of the board and changing their values. That gives it an edge-of-your-seat quality. (Though if you're playing the game right, everyone is standing up!) Don't bother playing with 2 people; grab some extra dice and play with 4-8. Play it quickly, have a blast, and move on to something else after a couple games.

THis is addictive fun! WOW! If you are worried that tumblin dice is just luck and no skill then let me say that this game has a ton of skill the more practice you get. At that point you can push the other players dice off the table and also do defensive moves by using your dice to block your other high scoring dice. This is a must buy if you like to hang with nongamers and drink beers. This is more fun than darts.

If I owned a pub, coffee or game shop, one game I’d keep set-up and available for play is Tumblin’ Dice by Randy Nash.  The game is attractive, constructed of finely polished wood, is easy to learn and fun to play.  Just about any age can play and be competitive.  It has the feel of shuffleboard, but without the tremendous investment and space required.

There is no getting around that the game is plain fun.  There is an excitement of knocking your dice into good scoring positions, or bumping opponents’ dice off the board, robbing them of points.  To be sure, it can be frustrating to properly strike a die, causing it to land in those difficult-to-reach "x4" locations, only to have a "1" or "2" appear on its face.  However, the game smacks of a sporting event, and succeeds in getting those competitive juices flowing.  It never fails to evoke shouts of excitement, cheering, and groans of despair.  These are elements of a fun game, which in the case of Tumblin’ Dice, is enough to overcome the significant lack of control.

RATING: 7
A very simple and fun dexterity game, Tumblin Dice really has the atmosphere of a party game. It works well in teams, gives everyone a chance to win, and leads to cheers and groans on almost every turn.

Players take turns flicking or pushing dice from the top of a series of stepped platforms. The lower platforms get progressively smaller, but provide progressively larger bonuses. The very smallest and lowest gives a times four multiplier to whatever face the die lands on. The tactics included blocking to protect your valuable dice and trying to push other peoples' valuable dice off the platforms. Any that fall off score no points. 

It's such a simple game that just seeing it set up you almost know how to play. It's very quick and will probably lead to multiple games in a row. The drawbacks are of course that it is large, heavy, expensive, and a pain to set up or transport.  

It would be great if someone would reprint this, but perhaps it's just too cost-prohibitive for a light filler. That's a shame, because it is a very fun experience. I've considered trying to make one, which seems doable, but even that would be relatively expensive and wouldn't provide the nice glossy sheen of a real board.

RATING: 6
A light party game where folks of all ages can play!

It is a dexterity game, which mixes in a bit of curling, as you can (try) to position your dice to block those in good scoring position, or "take out" those of your opponents.

A bit pricey for what is it, but it will keep the kids busy (even the adults).

If there is more fun you can have standing up, I don’t know about it. Tumblin’ Dice is without doubt the dexterity game I waited my entire life for. It punches every button: skill-dependent, fast play, quick rounds, wide-open options. It changes [thing=521]Crokinole[/thing], about which I’m increasingly ambivalent, from so-so to can’t-stop-playing by adding dice (and die multipliers) and changing the roundel to a track. That last change alone would significantly improve Crokinole for me: It’s the difference between playing marbles and playing firing squad. And when you can play firing squad with dice, things are looking up in the world of dexterity gaming![color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

[color=#777777]We play a game as two successive rounds, with the second round in score order.

We also leave 0-point dice on the board as blockers and potential scoring dice.[/color]

I'm still not so sure about this one.  Tumblin' Dice plays a little too quick for my tastes and doesn't exactly feel like the players contribute much to the outcome.  I'm eager to try team play to see if a more compelling game emerges, but as it is now I'm not terribly impressed- especially considering the money I put down for it.

Update:  It's best played with teams scoring Crokinole style (winner gets difference between loser's score).  There is also a bit of skill since you can get some shots close to 60% of the time with a well executed slide, but there's the rub.  As a friend said "Maybe they should say it's the luck of shuffleboard with the skill of dice."  TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.  That is all.

Re-Update:  Bah, I gave up on it.  Traded away with no sense of regret.

Played 5 times already, but I couldn't find any interest in this game. Sometimes, it is compared with Crokinole or Zopp. In my little opinion, I've felt that Tumlin-Dice is a bit worse than those. By the way, I agree that children like Tumblin Dice more than other dexterity games. I guess Tumlin-Dice is much more attractive for children. Besides that, Tumblin Dice has certain shortage. This game is less chance to maximize strategies or dexterity at all. I feel like I cannot be more dexterous by playing dexterity game.

The usable playing surface of all three is about the same space. Overall the tip to tip length of our first edition is 28" long and this new edition is 27" long. Side to side is 16" -- the same for both. I don't have the Ferti edition to compare to.

This is a lot more fun than it first appears, light but some strategy similiar to shuffleboard. Very much like shuffleboard but played with dice only things all go downhill if upper level is passed, very fun in the same way Crokinole is. 

Plays very quick (15 minutes) so makes an excellent filler and supports up to 4 or more with more dice and a few less each, haven't seen price yet so not sure if it's justified for a filler... My rating is likely a tad low, really need to play with 4 or more to get the full fun of it

This is for the Eagle-Gryphon version of the game.  I could say that this is a fun game based on the two times I played it before my boards warped beyond use. I think most people know the story by now of their failed Kickstarter campaign, so I won't bore you with details. My rating is based on the tremendously poor quality of the game itself. Yes, I did get a full refund and the unusable game is still mocking me on the shelf.  I rue the day I saw the original version at Hobby Town and decided the $50 was too much and to wait. After the Steam/Age of Steam controversy I had sworn off Eagles games but regrettably went back on that this one time. The Eagle games embargo is back in full force... 

*Update* Damn you Lisboa!!!  Making me break my word yet again.

What a fun game! Gamers and nongamers alike, all have a ball with this game and it is one of those rare games many can play even if you are enjoying a few cocktails, or a blast with just two. I catch myself practicing quite a bit since I got this gem. More fun and less dangerous to children (or adults that act like children:) than darts. Much easier to set up and put away that Carabande. My new gateway game to nongamers  (finally something every one enjoys thats not Ticket to Ride) Addictive fun! I got the first edition one piece oak board that came with no box, I emailed the company and the inventor Randy Nash responded immediately and sent me a box to my door in lightning speed, that is awesome customer service. Great combination of skill and luck. Who knew dice could be so fun:)

Throw dice to land on one of four levels that have increasing multipliers. I'm sure there is some skill, but it seems limited. You have some control over direction and force, but the die is a bouncing cube and other players dice often alter the path. Seems fun just for laughs.

RATING: 6.5
Surprisingly amusing.  You'd expect that the luck would overwhelm the game, but it is just fine.  One, the luck tends to even out - to a reasonable extent.  A "6" is also more likely to be a target than a "2", so high rolls can be a mixed bag.  And the multiplication factor is strong enough to encourage players to go for the high scores - and thereby emphasize the skill.  I like the ultimate design - including the bumpers well placed, which further encourage going for the high scores.

My initial impression was lukewarm.  I can see how if one is more experienced in flicking games like Crokinole, then the excitement would heighten quite a bit, as scoring higher would be easier, and hitting other players' dice would be more frequent.  So I think that my enjoyment should rise (as well as my rating) as I gain experience.  Still, it instantly attracts attention, is very well crafted and is very unique.

Update: As I predicted, it becomes more fun with a little more expertise.  Up to a 7.

Traded away - with Crokinole and Zopp, this has too much competition, though it is certainly quick and easy to teach.

Wish it wasn't so expensive.  Will probably pickup some day if can get at reasonable price or in trade.  I want to get the full-size one and not the Jr. version.

Homemade with 8 sets of 16mm Chessex dice--This game has been a fantastic hit with so many different types of gamers.  And it makes math a lot of fun for younger gamers, since the harder the math is, the more points you score.  I love how fast it is with 8 players, especially if you get everybody moving in a line around the table, since remembering turn order with that many players can be a pain.

Hard to find - even Online

A dexterity dice game consisting of four sets of colored dice one either slides, rolls, or flicks down a stepped surface. Usually one slides the die for better accuracy. After each person has slid their 4 dice, points are scored. You score the die roll times a multiplier of either 1×, 2×, 3×, or 4× depending on which area of the board the die is on. (Dice which land in the 0× region are immediately removed from play.) High scoring rolls are targets for opponents. Four rounds are played and the player with the most points win.

Several games.  Oh yeah - fun, dexterity game that I suck at.  Initially, I thought the game would be a fairly free-for-all, then my opponent developed dead-eye skills with the dice, and I was crushed.  It was fun - but I'd probably get tired of it quickly if forced into more than a few games every once in a great while.

RATING: 8
The best dexterity game I have played so far. You don't need that much skills to actually be able to win. The dices add the necessary randomness to give a chance to everybody. The only problem is that it seems that there is a low replay value, few people want to make 2 games in a row. It would have been cool if you could add obstacles on the board or be able to reconfigure the board. A variant I had proposed is using 1D6, 1D8, 1D10 and 1D12 instead of 4D6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A fun, excellent and addictive dexterity game involving standard six-sided dice (tho any sided dice would probably be nice variations).  Flicking your dice onto a multi-level or multi-tier board, with a group of players cheering and jeering you on is a whole lotta fun...  It's great to have this sitting on a table somewhere during gamedays, so whenever you have 2 to 4 players with some 15 minutes of filler time available, just walk to the table and do a game of Tumblin' Dice...  

12/2008 update:  I now really prefer Tumblin-Tumblin-Dice.  You need two sets for this and you double-stack them on top of each other in order to  have six tiers to shoot your dice.  Bottom (2nd set) tiers are doubled scores.  And, throw in a 10-sided for everyone's final flick.  This is version really rocks!  Thanks AngryDuck!

Very enjoyable dice rolling dexterity game.  Sure there's a ton of luck in what you roll, but the game is just pure fun.  Knocking people's dice off the board is just a good time.  We've even played with 8 players rotating around the board in a circle and enjoyed that as well.

I recently made my own Tumblin' Dice game board and we have been having a blast playing it.  Sure, it is not a complicated game-you can teach it to someone in under a minute.  But it makes a great filler, or party game, and can accommodate anywhere from 2-8 people, although I find the sweet spot to be 4-5 players.  I've played fun games with 2-3.  At 6 or more players, the board gets a bit crowded but then there is a lot of knocking people off.  There is some skill involved and quite a bit of luck so if luck bothers you this might not be your game.  We love it though.

RATING: 8
This is a great dexterity party game for rivalries and threats of vengeance. Pitchcar? It's tough to go after somebody else while still making a play that's credibly useful for you. But in Tumblin Dice, you can *always* try to ricochet that other guy off the table.

Only downside is that there are only 4 colors of dice in the box. I'll probably get 8 sets of dice for the game next time I'm at Gen Con or some other dice-loaded spending zone.

Fantastic fast-playing dexterity game. With two and three players, it doesn't take more than about 15-20 minutes a game, and it's a blast.

It offers a good amount of simple strategy, just the right amount of luck, and ample opportunities for smack talk.

After it's party night or two in the sun, it never came out again. And honestly, I think it was the box. The game never fits into its box again, which made transporting it juuuust enough of a pain that it never went anywhere.

Ok, so it's a SIMPLE game involving luck AND skill.  Yes.  That's a given.  However, the FUN FACTOR is incredibly high and you can teach the most game-negative person to play in seconds.  It's also got a high "I wanna play next!" factor.  Let's put it this way: take it to the bar, and tell everyone that wants to play after seeing you play that if they buy you a drink, they're in the next game, and you'll drink FREE all night.  Yes, it's that poplular.  My gaming group loves it and everyone who SEES it being played tends to love it, too.

The game itself is good but the latest edition of the Eagle/Gryphon board is a pile of junk.  It is manufactured to be in several pieces that you put together when you want to play.  They used such poor components that all of the boards are warped.  They promised to replace the boards and the replacements sent to them were all damaged.  Now we are told that we have to work with the manufacturer to get our replacements.  Someone should tell Gryphon Games that US consumer laws  don't work that way.  Stay away from this pile of junk unless you can get an original version of this game or a Ferti copy.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Tumble dice down a set of stairs to score points equal to the number rolled times the value of the platform landed on.

Played as: 2,3,4 player.

Pros: Very simple game with instant accessability to a wide range of people. There's a draw to the game where people can't help but want to try. Sturdily built to take a generations worth of abuse.

Cons: Basically a very pretty gimmick. Your score is more greatly weighted to the luck of the dice as the same well placed roll could be either 4 or 24 points depending on whether a "1" or "6" shows on the die.

Other: Taken with a grain of salt, the game still works as a fine diversion and should see plenty of play just by keeping it set up. I've played both the Nash and Ferti editions and noticed no difference worth mentioning based on the experience provided.

Best Use: Fun to keep set up on a convention or busy game night.

While I won't call this my favorite game, it does what it sets out to do better than any other. You can use skill to get your die on the 4x space, but you can still roll a 1. It's a random looking luck-fest, but if you wanted more strategy, you shouldn't pick a game about rolling dice.

RATING: 7
A quick dice throwing game where you score points of what's shown on the dice times the level the die is on (further down the ramps scores a larger multiplier).  It's good fun with some luck and some dex-skill.  It's very gratifying when you knock your opponents dice of the board or knock one of your own dice to a better scoring position.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun and short. Giving this a 7, but dex games are hard to peg relative to other games. I still need to figure out my scale for different types of games. It's not as satisfying as Crokinole, but it's good for what it is.

Really addictive. Getting the knack of trying to land your dice on the small 4x extensions takes practice, and even once you've figured out how to do it, you'll miss a lot of the time and want another try. It's neat that you're allowed to set your die in this game to what you think is the optimal side to make it come up six, but of course if it rolls any decent distance it's hard to guarantee.

Played with tons of people and it's a blast.  Everyone from young ones to old ones can have fun.    It works ok with 2 players each get 8 dice.  With 3 it works still but just not as good with 4.  Some say there's no control over die rolls and to lessen the luck factor just make every die count as 1 x whatever it's on. Don't do that.  I say if you see a 5 or 6 on a 3x or 4x then obviously it's a target that others must take down with precision accuracy.  If you let it stay on then it's your own fault for not knocking it off.  I've played over 250 games of this in the three months I've had it.  I love this and crokinole quite a bit. Update: bump to a 10 because for a 10 min filler doesn't get much better than this for loud fun being able to play 2 hours sessions with my Brother-in-Law who wouldn't be caught dead playing a Euro game try as I might.

This is a great dexterity game where each player must flick their 4 dice down a series of paltforms in order to land on the various levels to score points (x2, x3, x4).

Whatever value shows up on a each dice is then multiplied by that levels multiplier to earn points at the end of the round.

Of course each player can also try to flick their dice in order to hit dice owned by the other players and in doing so knock them off the playing field. This is where the fun of the game is derived.

Each level also has nice wooden pegs that dice can be bounced off. This is a great game and one I love having in my collection.

As Pitch Car, you also use your fingers in precision, to master this game. But in this game you can also destroy the others points.. I give this game a strong 9er, but it could easily get 10 in the future. A game that has been played a lot at our home. 

I like the addition to the game, where my father has presented a 12-side dice, which everyone has, as a bonus dice. Highly recommended and a MUST HAVE for every gamer..
Love the way, the intensity gets bigger between the competitors!!

RATING: 6
A light-hearted dice flinging good time.  You toss/flick/poke your dice down a slope trying to have them land on the edge of the structure you are playing on.  The last level would multiply the die roll by 4, the next level up multiplies by 3, and so on up to where you start from.  

Everyone takes a turn throwing one die down the line until all have thrown four dice, than multiply/add your four dice (ones off the board score 0) together and that is your score.  It really is a fun quick game where you can try and get the most out of your rolls, or try and knock your opponents dice down to secure your lead.  Set-up might take a tiny bit of time but the rules explanation doesn't!

RATING: 8
For a stupid dice flickin' game, this is a lot of fun when you're playing with any group who are happy to have fun. The dice flickin' is a lot more chaotic and uncontrollable compared to the clean Crokinole slide, but the chaos generates its own fun. Planning and generating a "knock-off / land on the 4x space" shot raises kudo levels considerably! All over in 10 minutes (4 rounds of 4 dice flicks each) which is perfect ... to move on or go again depending on how the flow is going.

With this game, you get exactly what you think you're getting: a dexterity game involving rolling dice.  The odd-shaped board, the ability to "knock off" opponents' dice, and the bouncing physics of the dice themselves make this game interesting.  If you're a fan of dexterity games, this is definitely worth a try (although the dice pips do add a random factor).  I'm not that fond of dexterity games myself, though.

A game about throwing dice down a wonky layered wooden board. It's as much about dexterity (you are trying to land your dice on the higher sections) as is about luck (not much you can hit the die perfectly to a 4x section but rolled a 1).  But its still surprisingly fun to play with kids and at parties.

RATING: 7
This is a game where you roll, push or flick dice down this staircase with the goal of getting the higher numbers on the lower levels where the printed score multipliers are highest. You can knock around other player's dice to hurt their scores. There's a decent amount of thrill when a player gets a fantastic spot only to be knocked off the board by the next player. This dexterity game does take some sizable skill to score anything significant. There's certainly a knack to it, but it's a fun warmup game experience.

Found at Bargain Thrift on 09/13/2007 for $3.50 new in shrink!!!

Setup of this game is kind of a pain. It is quite large. Only takes a few minutes to play however, so it is good to set up and play several games at a time. Great filler, as it can easily be played while waiting for another game to start. Decent dexterity game, but not really my favorite of this category.

A fun 5 minute 'game' for 2 to 4. Some skill in final die locations (flicking a la Crokinole) but ZERO control on pip value (perfect 'shooting' could still have a score vary by a factor of 6).

A lot of fun while you're playing it, and addictive, but really, when you're done it's just 'empty calories' that leaves you nothing to talk about.  It's 95% luck, and the rest is 'skill' on the level of tiddly-winks.  Dang, though, it's fun and addictive.  But I suppose tiddly-winks was, too, the first few times I played it.

Dexterity games have always been a favorite, and this one seems to be no exception. The comparisons to curling are spot on, for a big part of the game is to both protect (and set up) good shots as well as to knock others out of scoring position. The randomness of the dice can get a little irksome, but it does not detract from gameplay.

Received for Alien Frontiers (with expansions) as part of 4/13/17 U.S. Math trade.  So far, this game has been fun, fun, fun.  I mainly play with my two kids and this gives us the same visceral excitement as Pitchcar when making a good shot, but with much less setup/cleanup, less hard feelings (at least so far), and shorter play time.  Also, it requires much less table space.  I'm very happy that I traded for this.

I've always liked having some luck in games so that the better player doesn't always win. This is the first dexterity game that I've found with just that perfect amount of luck in it so that anyone playing at least has a chance. I've found that pretty consistently, at some point during a game everyone will gasp or make a similar noise when a particularly dramatic point swing happens. Plays quickly and as with most dexterity games, the rules are ridiculously simple.

A dexterity game, but now add a bit of randomness for how the die roll over the ledges and "adjust" their up face.  But at least one can try to hit one's own die to improve score or an opponent's die to decrease their score.  Others seem to love this, I don't.  Seems very mechanical - would much rather play Crokinole or Carrom.

I really think this is best with 2p.  Both players can sit at the end of the board.  With more you'll have to switch places a lot (minor annoyance, but others might not be bothered by this).

The set-up is actually very quick, faster than the vast majority of euro games I have played.

Not a lot of strategy or tactics, but hey that's not what it's about.

Tumblin dice! So much genius...glad I was able to snag the Nash Games full size edition, it's so much better than the little mini one you find in stores. The game is exciting to just about everyone who has seen it, the combination of dice and shuffleboard means that you can roll great but still lose based on the numbers, so no-one feels crushed. I love to devote my time to smacking the other players' dice off the board myself, it feels great when you can swing it.

I guess it all seems a little over produced for such a silly simple game. You could just about play this with some dice and a piece of chalk.

Another pleasant dexterity game.  Yes there is a little skill here in how hard you push your dice, but really, this game is mostly random.  Still, there is enough skill in trying to position your dice, as well as move your opponents' dice, to make it an interesting game.  Add to that the push you luck factor of the higher scoring areas and you have a game that is highly addictive.  While I'm not sure that I would play this ten times in a row, every time I have had the opportunity to play, I've wanted to play a second game right away.  That seems like the perfect description of a good game to me. [11/26/2008]

Cute if overproduced dexterity game. This one has a higher luck factor but games end so quickly (especially when you're drunk) that you will laugh and say, 'Let's go again!'

Players toss a set of dice and try to land it on scoring spots. Scores are then derived by multiplying scoring spot with the number of pips on the dice. You can, of course, knock out opponents dice.

This is a great gem of a dexterity game.  Quick and addictive with some strategy.  Your points are earned from the value on the top of the die rolled times the value of the platform.  Sometimes it is best to go for the score, sometimes best for the block, and often best to sacrifice a die to knock a big scorer off the board (or at least to a new value).

Tumblin' Dice is a pleasant diversion.  Most of my plays come from the set-up games at BGG.con, and Tumblin' Dice would serve well a game that could be left out in a game room while awaiting players to filter in.  Unfortunately, I don't really see it as a game that one would bring out and play, except as a filler.

Dexterity aspect is enjoyable, but the randomness of the scoring is not fun. I prefer to play simple points per die, ignoring the die values. Run away leaders are a problem with little chance to catch up -- even though there may eventually be an "epic" comeback if someone gets supremely lucky with a few 6s on 4x spaces.

Great dexterity game, and certainly fun when you've got a few minutes. Naturally, the most points come from the riskiest throws (trying to get it to the base without going off), so you've got some press-your-luck going on there. Combine that with the ability to screw over opponents by knocking their dice off the board and you've got a winner.

There are several wooden platforms that get lower and smaller as you move away from the start line. Each is a multiplier (1 --> 4). Take turns flicking 3 d6 from start line (1 die at a time). At the end you get pts for each die still on the board: # showing x multiplier.

Not a bad little dexterity game, but not one I need to own.

6/10

RATING: 7
This is essentially shuffleboard with dice.  The board is a sort of ladder contraption with each lower level being worth a higher value multiplied by the side showing on the dice.  The goal is to get the most points by getting the furthest down, you can also knock opponents' dice off the board to deny them points.

There's a nice mix of dexterity skill and luck since you can't really plan which side of the dice it lands on.  Getting 4 times 1 on the final level for example isn't as good as getting 3 times 2-6 on the next highest level for example.  Each player has 4 dice and it plays really fast, especially nice as a fun party activity.

I'm not a big fan of dexterity games but with how fast and easy this game is it really is nice for social situations with a lot of people.

Simple dexterity party game where players roll dice down a stepped surface; different areas are worth different points, multiplied by the face showing. That luck factor can create some great moments (don't knock my six off!), but while there is still surprising room for skill and strategy, it's not one of those games you could reasonably call a table sport -- the luck of the dice cheapens any victory.

[Nash Games 2004 edition] {action, dice, partnership; optimal 2vs2} Tumblin-Dice is a very fun action game. It's more exciting than I expected. The tablets are nice made - it's sturdy; the pillars are clear and strong; and, its surface is smooth.  More dice shall be provided to accommodate 6 players.  Players can play friendly or nastily.  And, a partnership can have many choices of action - shelter the team's dice, knock off opponents' dice, increase the value of a team's dice, etc.

It's special enough to be a collection item. Finally, I decided to get it just before the USPS surface mail shipping terminates.

[more players] I used the dice from 'Dancing Dice' to accommodate up to 4+ teams of 2 players. Each team takes the set of color dice - 3 dice per player.

I normally loath dexterity games. You won't find me playing f.e. Pitchcar racing unless I can't avoid it.

However, this game - played with the right crowd (not too serious), the right time (end of the evening) and the right drinks (modest amount of alcohol) - is simply a blast.

No pretentions, just trashtalk while plucking a dice down the board. There is some 'no you won't' and some 'yeah I did it' mixed with 'oh no' and 'I'll get you back'. Great fun!

RATING: 8.5
Wood games just cry out for homemade copies. So I made one with a nice sheet of plywood, some screws and some dowels. See my submitted images for a picture of my board.

This is my idea of a party game. It plays quickly enough that you just want to play it again. So before you know it you've been playing it for 40 minutes. It scales well from 1 to ?# of players. So a large group can play it or someone passing through to the kitchen can have a quick go at a few solo plays. And often there is laughter and excitement after a good or even a bad shot.

This was well worth the time investment.

Squared dice seem to work the best. Rounded corners make for very unpredictable shots.

I know this gets compared to Crokinole which isn't all that fair.  But I'm going to do it anyway.

Yeah, it's a different kind of game, but the flicking mechanic to flick toward a target is essentially the same.  

Crokinole is all about skill in flicking and tactical situations.  Tumblin Dice, is not, it's all about the luck of your dice facing.

I've played this a number of times and always had fun.  Tumblin-Dice is a game that isn't afraid to say "I'm a game for a bunch of people to have fun playing and laughing and cheering while they watch the dice rolling down the steps."  Some comments mention that it is too fast or random, but it doesn't profess to be anything but that.  It is, however, rather expensive and bulky.  An ultimate "Just one more game, I'll get you this time!" kind of game.

Tumblin-Dice is not much more than throwing dice down the basement stairs, with a multiplier for each step that they finish upon before hitting the concrete.  As a spectacle game, it is very effective.  As a chance-influenced dexterity game, it is not my cup of tea but I recognize the value.

If I were rating this game for the niche it fills in a large collection I would rate it a 10. I have 9 sets of dice and the game handles that number beautifully. I think it could possibly go to 12 if I had that many different uniform sets.

Plays up to 9, 15 seconds of explanation, very little  downtime, plays quick, plays equally well standing or sitting, can be played if your 6 or 96, impressive table presence, fun if your drunk or sober, it is not a word game/Apples-to-Apples-style game, everybody enjoys it. 

It is THE perfect light diversion for large gatherings of people who are not there to sit at a table to game.

The only drawback is that it has a somewhat large to carry and has a somewhat large footprint. It is not a pub game, but we are really just talking about a card table so the downside is minor.

The only guaranteed success for any occasion in my collection.

Fun mix of dexterity and luck.  A perfect game to have on the table as people arrive - there are no rules to explain and anyone can jump in.

Tumblin-Dice is always fun and if it weren’t so large, I might consider getting a copy. It involves flicking or throwing dice down a staircase ramp, trying to get as close to the bottom without falling off the end and trying to knock your opponents’ dice off the ramp. You score at the end of the round by multiplying the face value of each of your dice by the value of the level of the ramp on which it lies. It’s fairly random, but fun and quick. It can be played as a team game or free-for-all and always seems to be enjoyed by all.

I love dexterity games. But in Tumblin-Dice there is just so little control over the outcome. The range in scores from the "die" effect negates the scores earned from flicking skills. I think I'd like the game a whole lot more if instead of dice with variable pips you just flicked a little cube or disk or something toward a goal-- oh, wait, I think I've played something like that... oh yeah, Pitchcar and Crokinole-- both great dexterity games. If you find dexterity games just aren't totally random and chaotic enough for you, Tumblin-Dice is the game you are looking for.

A dexterity dice game consisting of four sets of colored dice one either slides, rolls, or flicks down a stepped surface. Usually one slides the die for better accuracy. After each person has slid their 4 dice, points are scored. You score the die roll times a multiplier of either 1×, 2×, 3×, or 4× depending on which area of the board the die is on. (Dice which land in the 0× region are immediately removed from play.) High scoring rolls are targets for opponents. Four rounds are played and the player with the most points win.

As dexterity games go, I have to give this one a fairly high rating.  The quality is excellent to boot.  There is the factor of luck in the way the dice might turn, but there's also the skill of knocking your opponent's dice off the table.  Definately a shuffle-dice game.

For some reason every time I get this game out I can't get anyone to play it more than a few times. It might be a little too silly (and not enough game) for most.

Great fun though!

Picked this up at Essen 09. I gave it a test play, and walked away, telling myself to go and look at 'serious' games...a couple of hours later I found myself itching for another play, and furnished several excuses to go back towards that corner, just so I could test play it again. After doing this 5 times I realised I had to buy it!

Party game that takes awful lot of storage space and gets played very rarely. Why am I holding onto this?

a simple fun dexterity game, probably will be played a lot as it is very fast, surely there's no strategy and probably not much tactics, just dexterity and a lot of luck

One of my favorite dexterity games ever. When I play this with friends we play at least three times in a row. It's amazing for how simple of a game it is as how addicting it can be. I hope they make an expansion for this.

Had no idead that I would like this game as much as I did.  So I broke my buying freeze, after playing this at a friends, and bought this for way too much.  But it was one of the best playing experiences I have ever had.

In the "awesomely dumb fun" category, this game ranks just below Loopin' Louie.  A good time.

Flicking games are not my strong suit but this one plays fine. It is a beautifully constructed game.

RATING: 5
Played twice (with 2 and 4 players). An unusual game for sure, which mixes dice-rolling with dexterity in an interesting way, but not one which really works for me. The randomness of the dice is multiplied with a possibly decisive factor - which means a single lucky roll can outweigh several skillful ones.

not real a borad game but fun 7.7 they explained me the rules

RATING: 6.5
It seems hard to get good control over the dice, once they start tumbling down a level, they get chaotic. So results feel a little too random for my taste, otherwise it would be a great game. I might try to build a copy myself with a surface that is not quite as hard, like unfinished wood, which might help here. But still, if you are playing it with kids, this "problem" actually turns into a feature. So I am glad I bought this, even if it only gets the occasional table time.

Quick, fun, strategic, competitive, dextrous.  Always liked by friends I play with.

This game was more fun, and more competitive than I imagined it to be when we started playing. The board is attractive and well-made, as it should be for the cost. Not a deep strategy game, but a fun choice for a social atmosphere. We played with additional players by adding extra sets of dice.

Tumblin Dice a light, but fun dexterity game.  Basically the game is a miniature flight of stairs and you flick dice down them.  You then multiply the die face by the level of step you land on.

Fun as a party game. It seems especially fun with four. It is not mainly about strategy or skill, but  the unpredictability of the dice hitting and scoring leads to excitement for all.

Junior version.  We find this to be very fun for a few minutes, a great game to play untill everybody shows up.  Kids seem to like this a lot.

RATING: 4
So far this is my least favorite dexterity game.  It is largely luck driven, as it would take such amazing analytic skill and dexterity to turn this into a reliable skill game.  

I'm sure Bruce Wayne could win with some regularity, but for me and my ilk, it is just a roll of the dice.

Moderately fun carom game of sorts, in which the caroms are cubes (dice, to be specific), falling down a gradual cascade - and they can fall out of play.  Due to the scoring system, you can have some nice upsets at the end of the game.

Not a great strategy games, but if played  with the right people, it'll bring out a lot of laughs!

After 10+ Plays: A fun flicking dexterity game, but one that doesn't match up to others in the genre like PitchCar and Crokinole.  Perhaps very skilled players can control what die face ends up on top, but to me it just seems like dumb luck, and it has a huge effect on the scores.

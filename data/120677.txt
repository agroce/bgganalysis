I thought for sure another play of this game would increase my rating but I was wrong. This game is too confusing at the surface level for the simplicity of the mechanics underneath. It felt too tactic-ish and not enough strategy-ish.

I understand and appreciate that a lot of time and energy went into the design, there are just some aspects of the game that are crippling *to me*. I find that the critical nature of my decisions are decreasing as the game wears on to the point that after the first round is over, I'm already past the half-way point on that decline. What faction you pick, and where you start your settlements will have a bigger effect on your success rate than any other factor in our experience (related to how likely it is that someone can effectively steal a spot from you, how effectively you can expand and exploit your faction's specialty, etc). This goes hand in hand with the static setup of the board, so the variable powers have favored setup locations and strategy already defined for them during that critical decision making period. As such, there are only a few spots that are of particular value for each faction, and outside of that, it's not worth it. So the net effect here is that all of my super important choices occur before the first turn, and as the game progresses, each choice I make is less likely to create any serious swing or effect on the end game, to the point where the final 2 rounds are largely auto-pilot in terms of game play.

Second, I find that I have 8 or 10 choices each turn, but really only 1 or 2 of those will do anything other than cause a backslide (similar to the opening setup choices), so I don't spend my time debating choices so much as taking the obvious choice and planning multiple turns of obvious choices in advance. It's a very tight game in that regard where the potential to "catch up" or make breakthroughs to put pressure on opponents in the second half of the game just doesn't exist. I like wide choices where no one choice sinks you and they are largely opportunistic in their timing and accordance with your strategy. Terra Mystica seems to favor a "deep" approach where you don't have as many choices, but you plan for multiple turns in concert. 

Last, it takes about four times as long to play a 4p game as I'm realistically interested in investing in said design. A large reason for this is that the late game decisions are all sort of meh. I actually enjoy the game when I can bang out a session online on lodev in 30 minutes.

It's not a bad game, it's just not a game for me. My 7 plays in person (3-4p) and 10+ on lodev have helped me learn my preferences in games, so it's not time wasted, but I won't play it again.

once read and read and read the rules and played it a couple of times I can say that it is a biiiig game. Tried with 2 and 3 players. Needs some adjustments for the 2-player because the temples can make a big difference. Having the majority on the temples most of the times means that you win

I see-saw on this one a fair bit. It's very abstract, and not very interactive. But it's a satisfying system and the depth is undeniable. A modern classic.

When I'm in the mood for it, it's awesome. But since the 'honeymoon period' I've only been playing it about once a year, and that's probably quite telling as to how much I really enjoy it.

One of my favourites. It's always a challenge to optimise your strategy. Terra Mystica has a very high replay value -  after all these plays I still have to explore some of the races I haven't event played with! Interactive in its core, with great innovative mechanics.

So sad that I only have 2 games under my belt so far. I imagine it will surpass Castles of Burgundy as my favorite.

just played our 3rd game, and the first time we did not play with the recommended setup. Wow. We were 3 players.

1 played the engineers, because last time he was screwed with bridges and this time he wanted to build them when he wanted to. Was majorly screwed by starting positions (he himself was to blame), so he lost. I was swarmlings, and played alright I thought. My wife was the green ones that is not witches, and won by far.

We started fairly far away from eachother, so we minded our own business. This also led Wife to win.

I LOVE this game.

Eventhough you don't win, you still get to build something.

What a great theme! It really captures the essence of what it means to be a monarch directing the urban development of a society of magical terraforming mermaids!

RATING: 8.5
The theme is bizarre and thin, the board is garish and bland (is that even possible), the description of gameplay sounds derivative, and yet...this is a great game.

An area control/building/point grab game that scales very well from 2-5 players, and combines a variety of tried and true mechanics with some new subtle twists.  There are a set number of rounds during which you, as one of 14(!) unique races, try to conquer as much territory as possible and score as many points as possible.  You have 3 currencies in the game, money, workers, and power tokens, all of which are useful and scarce at different points in the game.  Money and workers are needed for buildings which give you income advantages and set you up for potential point scoring.  Power tokens give you access to extra actions.

Points are scored in game by meeting various round conditions (these vary from game to game), by meeting the criteria of some specific races, and by building cities.  End game points are scored for longest contiguous area and for most influence on the cult tracks.  There's alot of different, variable moving pieces in this game and it really is more than the sum of it's parts (and it has alot of parts).  When this gets a proper wide distribution it will probably be a top 20 or better game on BGG.  Looking forward to more designs by this team.

A well functioning no luck game that rewards tactical play and punishes inefficiency. In every game there are many routes to take along with many varied races. The game is not visually appealing, so due to the lack of beauty I took off a star. The simplistic art style adds simplicity to the game, and for that I reduced the deduction to half a star.

RATING: 10
The heaviest game I own, in both weight and play experience. The first play through and set-up might be daunting, but persist and you will find a beautiful, challenging experience that rewards your initial fear. Once you've played it once, the set up is easy and the rules fluent and accessible. Highly recommended to watch a play through online first, then get a demo at a trade show/local store if possible. Even if you can't, if you want something meaty and intrinsically satisfying, get it.

RATING: 8
This is a very fun game, but be prepared for the first game to last a while.  There are a lot of choices and small rules to learn and absorb, and anyone prone to AP will have difficulty determining what optimal plays are with this one.

The races all have interesting interactions, but I feel that there are some that are strictly inferior or just un-fun if you get stuck with them.  This is, however an interesting and tight euro with many different avenues to explore.

Terra Mystica was one of the first games that really opened me up to the broader horizons of Eurogaming. I have it to thank for my love of Lancaster, Russian Railroads, and Tigris and Euphrates. And still, two years later, few games are as epic in scope nor as fulfilling in strategy as Terra Mystica.

I love civilization/engine-building games, and Terra Mystica is one of the best. Through two hours, you'll be building up your civilization, expanding through buildings that make you wealthier and more powerful, and manipulating the four religious tracks to gain points. Yes, this is more of an abstract puzzle than an immersive, thematic experience -- more Eclipse than Civilization -- but it's worth it, because the puzzle of the game is just so, so good. 

I haven't found a 'dudes on a map' game that really satisfies all my desires, and Terra Mystica does without even really being a dudes on the map sort of game. The map forces you together with your opponents -- and yet the power leaching mechanic rewards you for cozying up to them and building your empire right next to theirs.

Overall, Terra Mystica offers a near-unmatched experience. The only game I've found that comes close to it is Scythe, and that's an entirely different sort of puzzle that, while very good, is also very different. Terra Mystica remains one of the tensest games I've played and I look forward to getting a lot of play out of my own personal copy.

Rules explanation took approaching an hour, which serves to show the amount of different elements which make up Terra Mystica. Despite that, the rules feel fairly intuitive once playing - everything hangs together well. It may be slightly overcooked, as seems to be the trend in 2012/13 with big-hitters Bora Bora, Tzolkin and the like, but it doesn't feel as bulky as those other titles. It's an intelligent game, which doesn't outstay its welcome. I don't know if I really fancy ever having to teach it to someone else, so it may not be one I ever purchase!

5 plays / 3,4,5 players.

LIKE: Different races all have different powers and combos, which make mixed strategies. Deep decision tree, the strategies have interesting arcs.

DISLIKE: Very disparate mechanisms. The cult track seems tacked on. I almost want the cult and magic tokens to work together, but I understand why they did it this way. The bits can be fiddly. Many, many corner case rules. The game is difficult to comprehend first time through.

OVERALL: The more I play this, the more I appreciate it. The map and tracks add a nice competitive element, and both are tied to your strategy. The game feels similar to Tzolk'in.

If you have any interest in Euros, this is a must play (although be prepared for a long rules explanation).  This is likely bound for my Top 10 I like it that much.  I really want to try out all of the factions.

This game reminds me of Dominion (hear me out...).  Once you have your faction, you can literally plan out your entire game based on your faction's strengths and the scoring tiles.  With that said, you need to make some in game tactical adjustments based on how the other players play.  In Dominion, it is very similar.  You survey the available cards, decide on the most efficient way to build your deck, then execute your plan with minor tactical adjustments based on the cards your opponents are acquiring.

Five plays in, I've now tried : Witches, Dwarves, Alchemists, Halflings, Auren.

Excellent game with many interesting dependencies and unique play mechanics. Building cities and gaining power under strained conditions leads to excruciatingly difficult decisions. The various races in the game play quite differently and are wildly (?) unbalanced. My main take back is the trouble for new players. They can be crushed when playing against experienced folks - and frustration will set in when they realize they made early mistakes. The game is unforgiving in this way. But this hardly matters because discovering optimal play is delightful (even if losing in play)! I love it.

En un juegazo eurogame sin dados ni cartas, esta muy conseguido en todos sus aspectos, aunque se echa mucho en falta una interacción más directa de algún modo, y también variedad de mapa que determina mucho las partidas y su rejugabilidad (ver Gaia Proyect) a pesar variedad de las razas, que eso sí, es uno de los puntazos del juego. Un euro puro alemán a la altura de los grandes. Mencionar que es mejor para 4-5 jugadores, escala muy mal, ya que al probarlo a 2 jugadores incluso con mods como 1/3 del mapa pierde muchísimo (ver Gaia Proyect).

Felt a bit same as Colonia. There are just too many steps before you can turn resources into victory points for my taste. These multiple steps just introduce unnecessary phases into the game to make it more complex than what the depth of the game would allow for.

2013/12
6 -> 5
With more games setting the standard for a 6, this is clearly a 5.

2015/01
5 -> 6
Have to raise this back to a 6. We played this quite a bit before Finnish Nationals in 2014 and I started to appreciate the design, although I still do not enjoy the game as much as some other games. This is primarily due to the nature of the game that you are more or less programming your whole game in the beginning instead of devising things on the fly. And should you deviate even one step from the optimal path, you lose.

I'm not usually a fan of area-control games, but this one has enough resource management and economic engine building to make it interesting for me.  It feels a little like a cross between Small World and Settlers of Catan (but without Catan's randomness).  There's very little randomness and lots of paths to victory, which is good.  Why don't I rate it higher?  Mostly because of my aforementioned disinterest in area control games, and because TM doesn't do anything particularly innovative.  It's a solid game, but not one I'd want to play regularly.

首次嘗試，玩4人局，配件多、設置複雜，講解大約40分鐘，規則直觀，遊戲機制相當貼合主題，只是要額外花時間講解種族並熟悉，需要找長期玩家共同投入會更有趣，否則每次光講解就飽了。

得分方式多元，且因為城市建設的關係而富有成就感，遊戲的變化性/耐玩性在於
1、種族變化 2、每回合獎勵目標變化 3、遊戲結束時獎勵目標變化 4、多元得分與城市升級，後期資源會越來越豐厚。

遊戲針對性不強，唯一針對性是在鏟地時，可能搶走別人將要開發的地皮，其它時候都是在選取獎勵/升級來壯大自己，增加資源，比較像是競賽，並且某些決策有它的機會成本。

我很樂意再次體驗它，但卻不想擁有它，因為還要熟記規則並經常教導新人，每場遊戲加上設置耗時相當長。

One of my favorites on the heavier strategy side of my shelf, even though my initial enthusiasm has waned just a bit over repeated plays.  It's sort of like a combination of Puerto Rico, Settlers of Catan, and Small World, sprinkled liberally with pure genius.    

The art design of the game is beautiful AND brilliant, making it relatively easy for new players to pick up--lots of visual cues on the player mats so that everyone is constantly reminded of how all of the various rules work and how they interact.  I like that all of the factions are not created equal--some certainly seem much easier to win with than others.  This allows for some balancing among players of different skill levels, which makes this game more enjoyable for newbies than Agricola, for example.

Lots of choices in this game which could lead to analysis paralysis, but not necessarily a game where a bad choice at an inopportune moment seems to cripple you as much as other games (well, except when playing at the highest levels). 

The digital implementation is also well done, particularly given the vast volume of information that needs to be available for purposes of decision optimizing.  I'm actually a little surprised there aren't more bugs (though there are a few that remain even after a number of updates).

We've played this twice so far, and it's an easy 7 for me.  "Usually willing to play" fits my attitude on it quite well for the moment.  It may improve with further play, but I don't want to jump the gun.

Update: I'm bumping this up to an 8 after a few more games.  There seems to be a lot of depth here, and the variance in my final scores tells me that you can't just muddle through.  Clever play seems to score big points.  If only I was more clever!

This is a truly excellent game. I love how each race plays entirely different (different special abilities, different costs for actions, etc). Very strategic - this game is not dependent on luck (no dice rolling here). AND it's a ton of fun. Played with 4. I can see this as having huge replay-ability. Downside - I don't own it (and would likely have huge difficulties getting this one to the table with friends/family). I can't imagine this as good at 2 players.

Update: I now own it:) AND the family loves it...

This could be a new favourite.  A nice mix of area control, economics, building and resource management.  Based on the box art and photos I probably would not have given it a second look, but now I love to look at the board at the end of the game.  I'm still figuring out the deepest strategies to get the absolute best out of the races.  Only downside at the moment is that it seems some races may be weaker than others, but playing with less experienced people you can just take a harder race for more of a challenge.  Love it.

Such an interesting one!  The varied player powers and costs, along with the round chit thingies, vary the game nicely.  In addition, those competing desires to be next to others and yet not have them snap up your real estate.  I want to play this more.

6/05/13:  Upgraded to a 9.  LOVE THIS ONE!  Repeated plays bear out the awesomeness.  The 14 factions are cool, but it's the variability in the round bonuses and the turn tiles (whatever they're called) that make this worth playing again and again.  Plus (almost) everyone I introduce it to has enjoyed it.  One guy is lukewarm.  Very well done!

By the way, negatives (aka reasons this isn't a 10 for me):  (1) Game length.  This takes a long time to play though I think it's worth the effort/time.  (2) Lack of speed for player turns.  What other players do can influence what you do, thus making advance planning of your turn difficult at times.  This slows down play and is mildly unavoidable.  (3) The screwage is distinctly annoying.  Where does it occur?  Snapping up power actions and real estate, outflanking on the religion tracks, and in the number of cities.  I *really* dislike the limited number of cities in a 5-player game.  With 4 players, it's very unlikely to be an issue or ever come up.  With 5 players, it's unavoidable and devastating.  You can't wait on forming your cities and, if someone beats you by getting their 3rd (which I've seen happen), you may be out of the game.  Which stinks.

Notwithstanding these, a truly excellent game!

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Terra Mystica is a very challenging game. It feels very tight. You have always so many things to do, but you do not have nearly enough resources to do all what you would like to. You have to set your engine fast and try to use what you have at the best of your chances. The rules are not hard to learn, but the game is very hard to master. I like these things in a game a lot.

I also like the visual impact of the game and the components are a lot cooler than what I expected from the pictures. Also the their quality is very high, expecially the cardboard which is very thick. I don't like the art instead, but it's something I can live with.

The only doubt I have about this game is the balance between the races. I read that some of them are quite stronger than others... and I don't like that. If they were more balanced, this rating would have been higher.

Terra Mystica is a game with very little luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that each group has special skills and abilities. Taking turns the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. It is the ultimate eurogame for me at least.

Always a pleasure. Very strategic, very tactical. Looks beautiful, wonderful wooden pieces. 

I love this game. Always something new to try and equally as satisfying to repeat an old strategy. Mostly played with two, but really enjoyed a mega five player game this year.

Not much to be said, deserves its high rank.

Wow - I admit, I thought this game would be good based on it's fast rise to top 10 status, but I was surprised it lived up to the hype.

The gameplay is super smooth, there aren't any gimmicks, it was completely open, and with just enough theme for me to develop a bit of a storyline to the board evolution. I didn't feel exhausted at the end. To think there are 14 player powers, and from what I saw, they all play very differently.

This has become my new game to rush to 5 plays so that I can buy the expansion when it gets out.

:what: :) :D :D :) Pretty good game. Steep learning curve. I like it a lot -- but I like other things of equal length more. 

Very long and I generally prefer it as 3P/4P; 5P seems like too many cooks. 

This is a game I'm happy to play, and it hits most of the notes I like (area control, low direct interaction) but something about it feels just a bit off. Perhaps it's the (nearly non-existent) fantasy theme, as I don't like fantasy themes? Or maybe it's that some races/turns feel a little scripted. Still a pretty good game, although I question it being top-10 good.

And so it comes to past....i've tried TM once and I do have some pretty good feeling about it but similarly the amount of bad vibes do add to it as well.

The board is not modular, so its going to be same-same for repeated plays. Black is there, red is up there and blue hugs the river, etc.

As a Civ game, it lacks confrontation. the only 'war-ish' behaviour comes from opponents taking what you need first or just so happens there was nothing else they can do thus, they expand their territory in that pattern for that particular game session. Gamers expanded, as there was minimal choice, not because it was a strategy. It's not a game, so much as to screw your opponents up that creates confrontation, but its just a simple turn taking event that lead to a certain condition that is 'left by what is available to do.' The options are not 'always' available. Thus I do not see how this game could be that Civ-vy. Once you are there, you are there. period. Not for resources per se, but the changing/upgrading of structures brings new powers and completely removes the old. There is no 'stack em up' ladder.

removing all the beautiful art work, and what we have is a simple exercise of take A to get B and take B to Get C. That's good.....but you have to throw away A and B for that C.

Lots of game have been there and done that. There was no 'situational' gaming aspect that makes it a game to concentrate on. (Like a wargame about stalingrad, even though it may be the same situational battle, the outcome hovers on an expected antagonistic play. Further randomnised by uncertainty in dice rolling....)

Having said that, its a fun exercise with the right group of gamers. Especially those that hate confrontational wipeouts. The lack of random dice does create a math calculation kind of game play.

Beautiful components and artwork. Gameplay is smooth with some decision making in the beginning, but reduces dramatically near end game.

An above average game.

My go-to Euro, I have tried agricola, caverna, castles,etc. but in the end, the one I started, and played the most, is Terra Mystica. Its hard to describe how thrilling a match of terra mystica can get, and I dont really know why this one feels like the complete experience. Seems to me like the best designed game I have ever tried, and a testament of board game crafting. Its not for everyone, but certainly it is up there between the best.

I played a bit of this against AI and then most of a PBEM game that got killed due to one or two morons who wouldn't take their turns. I just can't bring myself to care. It's a "do this to do that" kind of game and I'm less and less interested in those types of things these days. I guess I don't like modern eruos much if this is what they look like. It basically feels like the boring, processional build orders of a computer RTS. Somehow this takes the timing and logistics that thrill me in something like 18xx and turns them into a dull chore. It's probably the modern euro point salad sensibility of weighing various decent options rather than arriving at a devious "aha!" moment.

It's like a Rube Goldberg machine that ends with a wet fart.

The imbalance in the game, depending on turn modifiers, bonus card selection and race selection makes it a bit dissatisfying. So I changed the rating from 10 to 9. It is still a very good game and I will like it very much; but ECLIPSE is a better game in my opinion - even with the luck based combat and discovery system...

Every time i play it i wonder how these mechanics were put together. Like really, what is this "mana" managment, rotating purple discs for no logic reason between 3 stages. Random rondel mechanic which makes no sense. Huge amount of cool races to play, but they dont really feel different to play. They opens up different ways to earn victory points, but thats all. 

It is sure game with huge replayability if you dont mind dry games. Cmon, we have many more excellent euro games with better implementations of mechanics, more theme and more fun. This game does not deserve such rating.

The only hindrance to playing is the time commitment, but honestly, it doesn't feel as long as it takes.  It is a fantastic game that I gain new insights into every time I play, and after 25 plays, I feel like I have just started scratching the surface in terms of strategy and how the game is balanced.

Excellent game. Have only ever played 2 player but love it in this format. Started out playing the traditional rules but after getting a hang of the game we saw instructions online for a double world alternative for 2 players. Essentially this involves each player controlling two factions each and at the end of the game they add and then divide their faction scores, to receive their final score. This is a very satisfying mode of play because there is very little down time and you get to develop two different strategies which hopefully complement each other and lead to your victory!

Would recommend this game highly to semi-serious to serious board gamers, and especially recommend 2 player as a great experience.

It took me a long time to come up with what I wanted to say for this game because it seems like a lot of effort went into the game and I want to get this review right.

The problem is, there's a lot of work going into the exact wrong places in this game. For example:
• The theme is the biggest lie ever. "But who cares?" you say. The designers. They care. Look how much effort they put into writing fictional stories set in this clearly bogus world so you'd think there's theme in the game. That's clearly a case of trying really hard and failing.
• The currency. This game has like 4 currencies and the entire gameplay consists of trying to efficiently convert them. That's it.
• The terraforming. Which ultimately, while it does have impact in the game, is something you actively want to avoid if possible because it costs too much. But TERRA mystica is the name of the goddamn game! You're clearly intended to terraform as one of the major aspects of this game and yet it's so cost-prohibitive that you will only ever do it as a last resort.
• Which leads into the upgrades system. Again, this system just fucks you as you upgrade your buildings. Why? Because they wanted you to have an interesting system where things slow down a bit as you move up. Unfortunately, this just chokes your resources and actions so hard that it removes all fun from the game.
• The scoring. This game is straight up point salad in the worst ways possible. The priest track is the most egregious offender but I've found that new players (including myself) get the most screwed by aiming for those early bonus VP. If you do, they almost invariably stop you from having actions for 3 rounds. THAT'S HALF THE FUCKING GAME.
• Trying to hard to be chess. It's not. It never will be. Stop trying. Chess has symmetry. I personally think chess sucks but even I can tell that Terra Mystica needs to get off its arrogant high-horse with a lot of the stuffy mechanics they jammed into here.
• The awful mana pool system. It's actually BETTER to remove as many as possible, despite the game directly warning you against this. It's disgusting and if you're new and see someone win because they can spam their magic super fast, you're going to flip the fucking table.

Things they didn't work hard enough on:
• The art. This game is droll and boring. Nothing is interesting to look at and the insane number of abstract symbols breeds confusion like bacteria.
• The fucking DOWNTIME. This game is only downtime. I had an idiot fanboy try to sell me on the idea that the literal 20 minutes of downtime pre-game SETUP is just "front-loaded strategy". It's not. It's 20 minutes of downtime where you painstakingly calculate. Which leads to...
• The most important 80% of decision-making is done BEFORE the game starts. I'm not shitting you. The single most important decision by a landslide is where you place your opening towns. If you want proof, just google Terra Mystica strategies. And the second part of 80% of your entire decision making for the whole game is...
• What clan you choose determines if you'll win or not. There's an entire ranking list of the clans with one that's a clear top winner, basically guaranteeing you win since the game is DETERMINISTIC after setup. Which leads to an even bigger problem...
• The game is deterministic after setup. Look, I don't like randomness either but when I can sit there and look at everyone's board and just literally calculate like a fucking computer the best possible moves for the entire game, FUCK YOU for designing it. And by "I" I really mean the actual real Terra Mystica AI that you can google right now that will always win because it can out-compute you. I guess I was wrong, this really is like chess in that regard.

In summary:
Boring, with no life. Stagnant. Doesn't make you want to play ever again. Counter-intuitive gameplay that directly contradicts the rules suggestions. Criminally unbalanced factions. 80% of the game is downtime and setup decisions. Any human ingenuity will always be overcome by pure memory and calculator power. Literally inhuman experience to play. Choked decision-making. A single misplay renders the entire game fucked for you forever, with no ability to recover in any capacity. Fake theme. Fake game. Fuck you.

If there's such a thing as an 'epic' Euro game, then Terra Mystica probably fits. It has some of the flavor of a 4x game, but it's actually a pretty typical construction and resource management Euro ramped up with a cool theme, cool bits, and cool variable races. 

Love the commitment to a full on fantasy theme. And it's fun! It's on the medium-heavy side of the complexity spectrum, but I think it's pretty darn intuitive. The design is so clean it makes me happy.

Good game, though I wouldn't call it great just yet. It has a heavy dose of determinism, and variability to play, but something about it just lacks spark. Perhaps that will change in future plays. 

(2 plays under belt - a 3 player and a 2 player, both times playing the Nomads). 

I feel this game rewards short term opportunism more than I'd like, where one's actions are in the service of generating points in lieu of doing something "cool" that, incidentally, scores points. For example, my most memorable move in my last game was taking a 3-points-for-a-trade-house tile before a round that scored 3 points for trade house placement. Scored 18 points that round ... and that's about as sexy as it gets.

Finally got to play this, super late to the party. And unsurprisingly, it's good. But it definitely doesn't feel like a top 10 game to me. The system is quite restrictive, which helps with AP, but didn't make me feel like I was able to do much in the way of clever plays. I like the asymmetry, I'm curious how different each faction makes the game feel (the tunnelers I played against seemed quite distinct). Certainly down for more plays, but probably won't pick up the expansion

This game rocks! Everything clicks once you play two rounds. The strategy is deep. It's everything that I wanted Settlers of Catan to be. It's not perfect and it's definitely not for everyone. But it's found a permanent spot in my collection and my only regret is not having tried it earlier.

An extremely clever engine-builder that has an interesting theme and absolutely beautiful components.  Plays very well and deceptively quick - the playtime drops dramatically as players get more experienced, and the game is all about timing your actions and optimizing  your race's abilities.  Balance is fantastic, though the Darklings are a bit strong and the Fakirs a bit weak, and there's a ton of skill in reading the objectives and other people's picks and grabbing a race (of the giant pile in the box) that plays well with the current spread.

The rules themselves are clean and straightforward, though the rulebook's not great, and the races all play very differently.

A good enough game, but a bit abstract, overall, for my tastes and I've only played with two, which does seriously constrain the interactive "mooching" / "cooperative" elements. It's interesting trying to manipulate your races abilities and buildings while also hitting the objectives, but it doesn't feel nearly so revolutionary as the heavy gamers I follow seem to feel. Certainly, I'll have to play with a bigger group.

Great game. Takes a few plays to really understand (and even then I'm still pretty terrible), but the systems all tie together really nicely and the game flow is excellent.

I felt pretty much the same while playing Terra Mystica as I did while playing Agricola.  Here is an admirable piece of design that achieves some quite complex things in intuitive, streamlined ways.  And those complex things all fit together to make a thoroughly coherent whole. That I am not champing at the bit to play either game again is down to personal taste. Terra Mystica is a luck-free, low interaction exercise in efficiency.  Each game's challenge is to grok how to get the optimum out of the race you are playing.  The terra-forming and board placement promises a level of Settlers-ish crowding and interaction that doesn't quite materialise.  Perhaps there is simply too much space and too little time (six rounds) to really get in each other's way.  

Production quality is very good.  The artwork is quite functional but rather dull.

Now that I've got two plays under my belt, it will be interesting to see if I continue to learn much strategy wise.  I'm not going to read the strategy articles, at least for a while, but based on my limited experience the keys to winning in order seem to be:

1. Fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of your character and how that impacts what you develop and where on the map you need to focus

2. Integrate the end of turn bonuses into your overall strategy.  You don't want to go completely out of your way, but it is a very important source of victory points that many players ignore.  I believe the ability to manage this properly is often the difference in games that involve experienced players.

3. Grab the bonus wish tiles for settlements and trading posts as early as possible. There may be characters for which this is problematic, but I have a hard time seeing somebody winning without one or both of these bonuses by the end of turn 3.

4. Don't worry too much about the end of game bonuses for connections and temples until the last turn or two.  Earlier in the game there is usually better things to do, and you don't want to get in a pissing match trying to get the lead.  

5.  Getting a third town is nice, but I think it is sufficiently tricky that you are almost always better off doing something else less risky.

This was a big positive surprise, by far the best eurogame i played in a long time. It has diversity, every game is unique, it is really balanced - all 5 players finished withing 30 VP of each other and the winner was not clear until the very end. It's a game that I would like to play much more often.

A big, deep and extremely overrated game that initially bruises your brain for relatively little eventual payoff. The fantasy theme here is entirely pasted on and the magic bowl thing is malarkey. The main board is painfully dull to look at; very euroy and beige, but all those wooden bits are lovely. It's cool that there are lots of varied ways to go about getting points, but this game is overwhelming for new players and there are other things I'd prefer to teach and play. It's definitely not bad. A lot of it is good. It just shouldn't be top 10 on BGG.

This is a strange but interesting blend between a worker-placement euro type of game and a civilization-lite one. There's no direct combat in this game but interaction with other players is encouraged by how the power-cycling mechanic works. Terra Mystica is probably my favorite game from 2011.

Magnificent game, I really enjoy playing it. It is so well balanced, and each race make it a completely different game. I consider it the same genre as Agricola, but TM feels less complicated once you played it. There are so many options, but you end less with the feeling that you just needed one more turn (which I always have with agricola). Believe me, this game is worth every cent you pay it!

Rating after one play. It's a nice game. Completely abstract but nice in a very inoffensive way. Has the same problems with caylus. Too many choices obfuscate the best way to proceed but there is little depth. I am willing to play this again and i would not object to it. I just can't understand what the whole fuss is about. For it's rank one would expect something very special which is far from the truth.

This is a good gamers' game, if not as spectacular as the current hype might suggest.  Two seemingly novel mechanics are particularly praiseworthy and interesting to think about and play with in Terra Mystica: the power bowls mechanism and the terra-forming mechanism.  Very nicely done.

The other mechanisms are also fun, and include a lot of familiar and pleasant things we have seen before, and I can see how the assymetrical powers and the evident, various pathways to earning VP's are likely to draw us gamers into wanting to play Terra Mystica a number of times to "figure it out."  

I think this game is "Feldian" in the sense that it's primary focus is on combining interesting mechanisms into a distinctive game with interesting decisions, rather than being thematically driven or determined, as perhaps, your average Wallace game would be.  As such, in the final analysis, Terra Mystica is not a very thematic game unless you "buy" the idea that playing a character type, and building wooden buildings to become towns, makes the game highly thematic.  It doesn't.  On the other hand, the game does create its own aesthetic and world, and that "world" feels like a nice place to play in, so the game has decent atmosphere.  

Actually, I think this game "out Felds" a lot of Feld games that are perched in the top ranks of BGG.  What that means to me is that if I am in the mood to play this type of game, I would much rather play Terra Mystica than Trajan, Notre Dame, Macao, or Year of the Dragon.  For me, this game has "fired" Trajan.  I would not want to play Trajan again if Terra Mystica were available to play instead.

It is pretty heavy and there is a lot to do. When you finally get your machine rolling and want to collect some points, the game is over.

RATING: 9
I usually describe this game to people as similar to Go, if Go was about 4 fantasy races colonizing Louisiana. It's weird, tense, counterintuitive, and crazily deep. 

The good: TM is tremendously strategic and varied. Well-suited to the gamer who enjoys researching gameplay in their spare time. The game is all about depth of replay value. 

The bad: not for the casual. The game easily punishes you for using the wrong strategy with the wrong race, and the races are a bit unbalanced and must be played very differently. 

This is the most critical review I've made of a game that is one of my great favorites. TBH my greatest criticism is that the barrier to entry for new players is a bit high (it takes at least a full game before you know what is going on). If not for this, I'd play it every damn weekend.

First impressions summed up in one word ‘Convoluted’. 

It had very little luck which is a good thing for a game of this complexity and length. It seemed like you needed to pull a lot of levers and press a lot of buttons to progress your civilisation a minimal amount. It was a learning game and with only two players so I realise I’m seeing it in its worst light.

I tend to shy away from games of this complexity these days. I get at very least, the same amount of enjoyment from the pure abstracts or the more streamlined, cleaner rule set, brain burners.

It also left me wondering if it needed more conflict for my personal tastes. It did have quite a bit of meat in the growing and building so I'm not sure yet.  

Once learned thoroughly though and with the right amount of players to tighten up the board I’m sure there is a lot of fun to be had here.

Most of my plays of Terra Mystica were online. Terra Mystica is the best Euro I've ever played and it certainly deserves its spot on BGG Rankings.

The subtle changes of each game and the combination of different races make this game a unique experience every single time. Highly recommended to anyone who has even a remote interest in Euro-style board games.

The reason I don't need this game in my collection is I have a friend who owns it and there won't be many opportunities to play this game on the table with three other people around the same skill level anyway.

terra.snellman.net is a perfect online implementation and everyone should give it a try.

This is the game I love...and am not very good at.  Doesn't matter, I'll play this game every time someone asks to play.

Played at BGG.CON 2012 with 5 players.  

Cool mechanisms similar to other games, but implemented very well.  In particular I really like that building buildings gives you access to money/magic etc.  

One major plus for the game is having asymmetric starting races that have unique abilities, but are not so wild that there are gross imbalances.   

I think playing with 5 will definitely be better than 4.

Variable player powers, economic engine building, four+ currencies, and competition for limited space.  As a bonus, victory points are granted at the whim of randomly chosen (before the game) tiles, and the things you do for points often do not align very well with the things you need to do to grow your economy.  At the moment I think this is wonderful, but I worry that it's actually just a parsing problem disguised as a game with meaningful decisions.  I'm having fun parsing though, even after a dozen plays.  Much of the game is front-loaded, with a pre-first turn plan needed as to which scoring bonuses you plan to hit and when.

RATING: 7.25
Correct and enjoyable in some way but I do not know why people like this game so much. To me is not even top 100 but even so I could understand that it be the 80th, 90th or so, but top 3 almost top 2 above Agricola, Mage Knight, WoR, Dominant Species, Caylus? It is going to surpass TTA and maybe Twilight Struggle. Are we serious?

I am sorry but I do not agree with this rank in particular. It is the only rating in all top100 that makes me jerk up. In our crew all people think the same thing, even the game owner does not understand the rating of his own game. 

PS: I hate Eclipse but I can see some virtue in it as game to bring it to the top 10, nonetheless I do not see this same thing in Terra Mystica.

A whole bunch of easy to understand game mechanics piled on top of each other with clear and concise iconography. Dry and dull gameplay of building an economy to time things right so that you can get the oft sought "victory points" and push your little cubes up tracks.
If you'd have shown me this 10 years ago I would have been all over it but this is just more themeless euro number crunching where you adapt to board situations and sit in near silence with your fellow gamers while you figure out, to be honest a very clever, little puzzle.

I see why people like this. Not sure it deserves the high praise it gets as it is nothing new. Not for me.

Too many interlocking mechanics. I admire the design effort, but sometimes it feels complicated just for the sake of being complicated.

+ It's a solid design. There's nothing about the game that feels poorly designed, it works.
- It works because it's the same game I've been playing for years now. The theme is 100% irrelevant, the game is a mash up of mechanics from other games, close to no interaction. While it is competent, it's nowhere near exciting.

It's depressing how stagnant this industry is in terms of creativity, at least for this genre.

I tried playing Terra Mystica against an AI several times, and the game is better than I thought it would be. Nonetheless, there are some problems. (1) The player interaction is small, you may want to try to stop your opponents from building towns on the map, or compete for some cards or bonuses, but this doesn't make a huge difference. You'll want to expand/build wherever it's cheaper to do so, so hurting or affecting your opponent in anyway is pretty rare. (2) This is an extremely complex game, and you have to find players that don't mind that. There are so many competing factors to think about, that analysis paralysis should be quite common. (3) Each faction will be played pretty much the same way every time, in other words, there is a dominant strategy for each faction. You want to take advantage of the stronghold and sanctuary powers for almost every faction, and that is basically what you're limited to.

RATING: 8.5
The learning curve on this game can appear steep, but it's important to note that learning the game is harder than actually playing the game... significantly so.  There are lots of elements and exceptions to try and manage in your head as you read the rules.  The rule book is not the most clear, but it has more to do with how to present the game than with poor writing or translations.  If you can learn the game from someone, the journey will be much simpler.

Once the rules are comprehended, actual game play is quite simple.  6 Rounds with 3 phases each: Collect Income, Actions (multiple mini-turns with 1 of 8 actions), clean-up and prep next round.  The individual actions are easy to understand.  What you get on the output of this though is a rich complex game with a nice balance of player interactions and individual planning.  The duration of the game is quite well refined, leaving players feeling neither like the game overstayed its time nor being too short to get anything done.  The game achieves a unique combination feel of being both very well balanced and asymmetric.  The former coming from the mechanisms and the latter from the different factions.  

Overall, this is a solid title and a good candidate for the Kennerspiel 2013 prize.

I have the iOS app version, which I like best for this game.  One looks at where the bonus points will be, and then just plays accordingly, to the strengths of the character race you chose to play as in the game.  But with other people, I find the game just doesn't move fast enough to keep from waning.  The only real interaction occurs when others take the things you want.

Hard to wrap my head around, and very Euro, more so that it isn't a magical realm to me much.

There's a lot going on in this game, which combined with only a single play leaves me a bit uncertain about the rating. 

Mechanics wise, the game is very good. It's a mix of resource management, building placement and upgrading game; nothing truly groundbreaking, but I thought the energy system was innovative and a nice way to introduce some direct interaction and extra strategizing into the game. I also enjoyed the way the game is structured to curtail a snowball effect through the building upgrades. There's a lot of things to balance, and for now it felt like it's possible for different approaches to be sucessful. 

These great mechanics are largely dissociated from theme, which for me is unfortunate as I prefer otherwise, although I appreciate that the game for the most part is honest about being abstract and doesn't try too hard to shoehorn a theme into it.

Finally, all the different factions and their subtle differences are a big plus. Though I think there's a definite risk that they're not fully balanced, it felt like they potentially favour different approaches providing a lot of replayability, and should make for an interesting analysis of the various possible strategies.

A complex game that I learned to love over lots of plays. I do not have to comment on the great mechanics, awesome interaction and nice design at this point, but I would like to point out that the different races play quite differently, especially in combination with the other players.

More experience will no doubt serve to give me a better understanding, but if I want to play something heavy and involved I will much prefer Agricola.
There's a choice of seven actions (and an eighth which is pass) each time the round comes back to you. Even with a couple usually being safely ignored working out what is best seems beyond me.

It's a more complex Eclipse-like economy with an interesting area control mechanic. Shut up and Sit down said it best when they said "everything in this game will remind you of a different game" - but it's all fun. 

As far as Euros go, this one is really good.

I really want to get it to the table more. I feel like at this point I've only scratched the surface of the game and it's going to get better with more plays (and I see how to block other players rather than just go for my own goals.)

I like the snowball affect it has. The game is only 6 turns, but that last turn is about as long as the first four combined.

A whole lot of moving parts, but they fit together _really_ well. Very high replayability due to the massive amount of distinct races, great components, and reasonably swift gameplay despite the total length. Occasionally someone will have a bout of analysis paralysis, but generally most individual turns flow swiftly (as mostly the previous action won't cause you to have to rethink what you're doing), meaning that you generally don't have too long to wait until your next turn, even in a five player game. Deserves its swift rise through the ranks.

Bumped up my rating for this after six plays from 8.7 to 8.9, and further to 9.2 after seven plays; the more I play this, the more I start to appreciate all the ways this game has been balanced. So many subtle tweaks to the board and the different races. Games keep getting more intense. This won't ever rise to a 10, but it's overtaken Agricola way faster than I'd have expected.

Opinion after first game:
- Not a bad game but playing time is a bit too long.
- Playing the 'engineers' felt too much like the game dictated what needed to be done.
- Choosing the best race for your game requires a lot of experience at the start as they dictate your strategy if you want to do well.
- Player interaction can be very limited (5 player game)

Prefer Hansa Teutonica + Osterweiterung

Yes. It really is *that* good. It deserves its very high ranking. The rules might be a bit daunting at the beginning, but once you get going, it's a wonderful game. 

It has multiple ways of scoring, but it's not really a point salad, as the two only real ways to score are expanding or increasing your religion.

It also provides you of myriads of ways to bypass someone else "blocking" you (as in, stopping you from doing what you had planned), even if they tend to cost a bit more effort. But you're never completely out of options, and that is really rare in a game so deep.

It might grow up to a perfect 10 for me. I've only played it once, but I'm really glad I bought this gem.

Very interesting games.  With a couple of sessions under my belt it's hard to give a rating.  In my last game I felt like I did everything right and was leading in all the end game scoring categories and somehow came in last place.

Very keen to dig deeper into this one (no pun intended).  It feels very different from other Euros.  Is it an area control game?  Well sort of.  Is it economic?  Yes probably.  Point-Salad?  I suppose.

It's also a bear to teach.  There are so many moving parts and systems that it's difficult to know how best to lay it all out for new players.

The other big question people might have is whether or not this is "thematic".  I feel the answer is both yes and no.

Yes - The things you do seem to make sense mechanics wise.  Build small houses for basic workers.  upgrade to trading poses for more money, or temples for more priests.  etc etc.

No - While the individual parts make sense to me, Im not sure those parts really jive well with the fantasy setting.  In fact it's not super clear that this game is really about anything.  If you were to make a list of the things that you should be able to do in a "fantasy civ" game I dont think any of the actions in Terra Mystica would be on that list.

So it's an strange sort of a beast.  Very interesting game play in a setting that isn't nessesarly compelling but still thematically coherent.

Each player is one of 14 diferent races, though as each two races share a color, if one player chooses one of those the other race with the same color becomes unavailable.

Ez egy nagyon jó játék!! A 2012 Esseni nagy favoritok közül volt több csalódás is (Escape, Keyflower, és egy kicsit talán a Robinson is), de a két legsikeresebb darab, a T'zolkin és ez nem okoztak csalódást.
A Terrát úgy harangozta be mindenki, mint egy bonyolultabb Hansa Teutonicát, ami az egyik kedvencem, ezért nagyon kíváncsi lettem. Nos a hasonlóság kb. abban kimerül, hogy a saját táblánkon tudunk fejlesztgetni... szerintem félrevezető volt ez a hasonlat. De ettől még szuper a játék:)
Pozitívumok: A manna rész nagyon ötletes, a terraformázás átszínezős megoldása is tetszik. Nagyon jó ötlet az is, hogy a legfontosabb épület olcsóbb, ha más mellé építjük, így szinte szükségszerűen egymás közelében leszünk, ugyanazokra a hexákra akarunk majd építeni, így dinamikusabb lesz a térképes rész. A sok faj (7x2) nagyon nagy újrajátszhatóságot sejtet, és 7 teljes szett fa van a játékban, tehát nem spóroltak az anyaggal, pedig valószínűleg 5 szettel is megoldhatták volna. A játék egyébként nagyon szép, igényes, tökéletesen nyelvfüggetlen.

Negatívumok: A hajós rész talán egy kicsit felesleges bonyolítás, de gondolom letesztelték, és a híd kevés lenne, túl könnyű lenne keresztbetenni egymásnak.
A másik, hogy elég sok mindenre kell figyelni, nekem határeset, még éppen belefér ennyi, de azért van pár öncélú dolog, amit csak azért tettek bele láthatólag, hogy bonyolutabb legyen tőle a játék. Mert itt aztán tényleg minden van: templomozás, mint a T'zolkinban, bónuszok választása kb. a Puerto Ricos mechanizmus szerint, vannak extra akció lehetőségek (fixen a táblán és egyéb helyeken is), van egy fajta lapka mindenféle bónuszokkal, amit a vallási épületek építésekor kapunk, egy másik féle lapka, amit a városok építésekor, stb. Elég nagy az AP veszély.
A sok faj, amit pozitívumnak írtam, talán kicsit kérdésessé teszi a kiegyenlítettséget is. Pl. Az Engineers elég gyengének tűnt, a Witches meg sokkal erősebbek, de biztos mindet lehet jól játszani, csak bele kell jönni. A játékszabály 1 óra, a dobozon szereplő játékosonkénti fél óra játékidő pedig nyugodtan szorozható legalább másféllel.
Összességében nagyon bejött, annak ellenére, hogy hosszan soroltam a negatívumokat is, ez még akár nagy kedvenc is lehet, ha lesz olyan társaság, akikkel gyakran elővesszük.

Definitely a good addition to a collection. An area control game with the choices, puzzles and variety that could come with it. It has a learning curve to it, but as soon as you get the basics, it plays like a charm. Every race does play differently which gives a perfect flavor to it and get the number-crunchers go scratching their heads occasionally. Better with 3+ players

Ki kell jelentenem, hogy ez egy REMEK játék!
Több korábbi játék mechanizmusa felismerhető benne, azonban a "hatalom tál/manna" használata unikum.
A tartozékok mennyiségére, és azok minőségére nem lehet panasz. Van benne anyag és "erő"...
A 14 faj más-más képessége pedig garancia a játék sokszínűségére és újra játszhatóságára. (bevallom vannak fenntartásaim az olyan játékokkal kapcsolatosan, ahol a játékosok nem azonos "feltételek / lehetőségek" mellett játszanak!)
A játék szabályrendszerét nem mondanám bonyolultnak, inkább talán sok "apróság"-ra kell figyelni. (pl. leléptem a megszerzett VP-t?)
Egy lépés során nyolc akció közül lehet választani, így azok megtervezése, illetve sorrendjük kialakítása elég embert próbáló.
Kizárólag gyakorlott játékosok számára ajánlott!

Szívem szerint 8.5 pontot adnék neki, azonban a borzasztóan hosszú játékmenet - sok holtidővel - ront ezen.(Úgy vélem 4 játékos az ideális játékosszám.)
Ennek ellenére bármikor szívesen játszom vele a jövőben...

I approached Terra Mystica with caution, more than a year after its initial release, due to distribution problems (it seemed victim of some kind of curse, and the italian version was repeatedly delayed, while the Z-man version was in reprint after reprint). The hype and #7 on BGG… what to expect from this game?

Just one word: awesomeness!

14 races with asymmetric powers, variable set up with different short term goals, great interaction, tough trade-offs between points and development, awesome components. And the gameplay is smoother than one can expect from a game with so many moving parts and intertwined mechanics.

Is there anything I can add?

Can't wait to play it again and again, and explore all the different races and strategies.

I definitely feel it will find its place in my top 10.

Initial Impressions: This is the quintessential victory point salad game. There are as many different ways to get VPs as there are different mechanisms in the game. Everything seems to meld really well though and overall the game is enjoyable. Multiple races with variable player powers will give this game a long life but it seems that the powers may not have been balanced as finely as I would like.

Excellent strategy game. Asymmetrical factions keep the game fresh. How well you employ those asymmetries often decides the game's outcome. If you want an involved asymmetric efficiency engine with scoring variability, this game is for you. 

Once you learn to play a particular faction, you may find the game to play out a bit prescriptively when you play that faction. That prescriptiveness is an indication that the faction assymmetries hide that this game is less a competition for board presence and more a puzzle played alongside others.

I can't say enough great things about this game.  It's complicated, but with numerous small mechanics instead of complex large mechanics.  The theme is excellent and can bring non-gamers in.  The only knock is the limited interaction during the game.  That's not to say that what your opponents do doesn't matter, but there's nothing that you can do during their turn to stop them.

Optimization game. At least the variable player powers and the large number of people combination makes it quite replayable.

This game is really not that hard to learn despite its heaviness. The player board is really intuitive (maybe cause of the similarities with Scythe that I played before this) and it has so many nice hefty wooden components. To do well in this game is an entirely different story, it rewards repeated play and it provides the most nail-biting experience if everyone is experienced in it. 

Replayability is insane in this game with the huge number of races and there's no luck at all completely in this game. Everything is open information right from start, you can map out your entire game right from the get go. This is like Catan meets Scythe, improved one hundred times over. Strongly deserves its place in BGG top 10.

Mit Terra Mystica erscheint in Essen ein Vielspieler-Spiel welches alles, was ich persönlich an Spielen dieser Komplexität mag, in sich vereint. Komplex, variabel, nicht ausrechenbar! Hier eine allen überlegene, immer funktionierende Strategie auszuarbeiten, dürfte nicht möglich sein.

Terra Mystica seems to think that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts -- and it has parts [i]in spades[/i]. The idea is interesting, and the graphic design of the game is quite well done. Unfortunately, I find that the overall experience falls quite flat. 

The variable income resulting from building new dwellings or upgrading existing structures is an interesting idea, and helps to create a very tight budget for each player. (I won't say 'economy', because I don't think there is enough interaction to call it an 'economy'.) This income mechanism combined with the limited rounds and increasing marginal cost of terraforming certainly creates a tense experience trying to accomplish your strategy. However, this tension comes at a significant cost: due to the large number of 'resources' (or 'currencies') and the possibility to converting between them, this game is incredibly mathematical. Calculating, re-calculating, and re-re-calculating costs, incomes, and conversions is necessary to execute any kind of plan. Being thwarted by an opponent is fun; being thwarted by miscalculating a three-step resource conversion [i]from the last turn[/i] is not. 

Connected with this is a strong feeling that the game is simply needlessly complex, perhaps to appeal to the idea that more nice wooden and cardboard bits make a better game. Besides balancing factions that rely on it and adding a function for the priests, what purpose does the cult track serve? The many sources of VP also diminish the opportunities for player interaction, and make strategy more opaque (rather than [i]deeper[/i]; the former is undesirable, the latter is desirable). This is despite the fact that all players are seemingly competing for spaces on the common map. Due to the limited resources and high costs of terraforming, it seems to rarely make sense to play aggressively (except perhaps in a two-player game), as otherwise the other players will gain a relative advantage.

For this reason, the player interaction is mainly found in the round action tiles, round bonus tiles, and (perhaps to a lesser extent) the town, bonus, and favor tiles. The fact that the main player interaction is jockeying for action tiles and round bonuses and competing for the 'best' bonus tiles, rather than 'on the board', is somewhat anticlimactic given the apparent opportunities for player interaction via terraforming. I don't really care for this sort of player interaction in general, and perhaps care for it even less in Terra Mystica as it is so critical to performing well but is also overly complex in and of itself and obfuscated by the complexity of the rest of the game. 

The different factions are a key feature of the game and seem to reflect a trend of providing 'variable experiences' (artificially increasing replay value) in lieu of depth of strategy and/or balance. And balance is a key issue with Terra Mystica: the factions are quite imbalanced, to the extent that bidding for factions with VP is essentially necessary to make the game competitive. This compounds the following point, which is that the game is dominated by early planning and execution rather than adaptability. Like Dominion and Princes of Florence before it, Terra Mystica requires players to develop a strategy at the outset based on the round bonuses and action tiles in play, and then execute that strategy as efficiently and flawlessly as possible. The problems with this type of 'front-loaded' strategy in Terra Mystica is (i) the execution of the strategy is dominated by the mathematical nature of the game (see comments on resource conversions), and (ii) it takes a [i]long[/i] time to see your plan through to completion. Compare this to Dominion, which requires similar front-loaded strategic planning, but plays quickly, or Princes of Florence, which shares features including limited rounds, but reduces 'brain-burning' complexity to allow players to focus on interactions for key auction items and best work.

A quote from BGG user Cole Wehrle sums up some of my remaining thoughts (emphasis added): [i]Update: A few more plays are confirming some of my fears. It is [b]much harder to block and interact with skilled players[/b]. The [b]most interesting relationships in this game are with non-players[/b] (the various conversions). There is [b]little sense of a "game"[/b] and [b]very few ways to manage incentives[/b]. In short, it's [b][u]a conversion puzzle performed in proximity[/u][/b][/i]. If the 'game' poses more challenges to me than the other players, I would rather find something else to play; even worse if the game is as brain burning as Terra Mystica. 

Terra Mystica is an interesting concept -- or perhaps a collection of interesting concepts -- and one which obviously appeals to many people, but I find it to be more [i]work[/i] than game, and ultimately not very much fun.

Eseen 2012: A rule book that takes some time to get through but well presented none the less. After reading the rules I could not envisage how the game would play. Having finished game one I don't think I could.

This is a very heavy Euro. The options for each turn are clear but you are swamped for choice. At game start your options are limited, by turn 6 you are scrabbling around trying to beat the others to the key features and points. There are so many paths to victory.

Game 1 needs to be considered a learning experience, after that this will become an extremely cut throat battle for experienced players. I'm looking forward to game 2.

Second and third games all in the same day. I like this one alot and the winner is never cut and dried until the very end.

Passed on this the first time around because the theme turned me off. Elves and Chaos Magicians, hobbits, and the like do nothing for me. Glad I got it the second time around. Very tight, very heavy game with plenty of indirect interaction. Feels a bit like Vinhos (which I love), or some of the heavy, economic Wallace games; where you have a very finite amount of actions, but a lot of choices.

This one is just great, and I love the competitive synergies that evolve around being in proximity, and all the little races that come along with that. Speaking of races, the factions are all well done and interesting.

I enjoyed it, but it ran long and my wife was a bit overwhelmed. Also, the races don't seem balanced, but that is just speculation based on one play.

Recieved from my first ever BGG Secret Santa. A good game that has lots of replayability, but the factions clearly are not balanced.

And this truly scratched my itch for a new game with lots of cubes&bits&pieces.

Glad that we finally took the time to sit down and play this game.  Took awhile to get the rules down, rulebook is both long and confusing.  But once we got to grips with the symbols the game started to flow.  Lots going on, and really great to play.  Looking forward to playing it again!

Not my favorite game. It's doing a lot of cool things, but I think it takes too long to play. It has my least favorite game aspect in that it rewards having played Terra Mystica a lot. So if you want a great game that you can learn nuance after nuance while you play it 80 times, it is great.

After the initial setup there is no randomizing element in the game. So, you can't blame it on the good/bad luck.

It's not a bad game, but I don't think it's a great game either - it's an average game that takes quite long to finish. I see this game more as a "serious" game than as a "fun" game. I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I still prefer games that are "fun".

RATING: 9
From the designer of Kaivai, one of my top games, comes this gem of a gamer's game. Everything about the game screams excellence. The strategical choices, the immense replayability with the different races, the tactical options being made within your strategies, the theme, the components and, of course, the well thought out design all lead to awesomeness in a few hours.

Central to the game is a terraforming mechanic which requires resources, tech upgrades and the ability to intelligently compete for spaces on the board to do well. Intertwined with this mechanic are the different races' special abilities which give the game longevity. Each round provides a different victory point condition (different every game) for that specific round which guide your choices of when to build certain buildings, when to terraform, when to hold back and when to explode with your actions.

Granted, if you are averse to heavy Euro games, this might not be your cup of tea, but for heavy Euro gamers this is a delicious dish that doesn't leave room for dessert.

After second play: liked it MUCH more than first time and I think it has potential to grow further. Definitely a gamers game. Rating = 8.

After the fourth play: I have been officially converted. This game is amazing. It most definitely gets better and better, whereas I often cool off on euros after a few plays. The multiple races really make this game. Rating = 9.

This game impressed me quickly and that's something for a game that I didn't even expect to play or like much at all.  It's a doozy and I'm very impressed.  The uniqueness of the races and the spatial element to the game with the many different ways to advance.  It's very good.

After 9 plays, I like this game more than I first did.  It's very well put together and I look forward to more plays.  There are a few races I haven't played yet and I definitely want to try some again that I really struggled with.  It feels like there is so much more to get from this game.  My favorite in the last several years (since Brass, Hamburgum and Pandemic).

My only criticism of this game is that the theme is non-existent and unlike Descent or Rune bound there is really no story after the game is finished.  This game is just about getting VPs.  This is pure strategy without a good theme and basically nothing to talk about after the game.  Because it lacks theme this is a 3 for me and I'm being generous.  Chess has more theme with knights bishops kings queens towers and pawns.
Less theme than expected and more a optimizing game.
Very over rated 

Conclusion:  The fantasy stuff is really skin deep. I played this game a few times and appreciate how interesting it might be mechanically and then never want to look at it again.

Positive: Deep and with lots of variety. Great variety in set-up and ending conditions. Really good engine builder. Very strategic, some interaction, but on a strategic level.

Negative: There is some downtime. You have to form your strategy before the game, actually before you decide for a race, since you choose the race best suited to the set-up, which is hard for beginners. You cannot adjust in the later stages of the game. There is not much interaction, but its not multiplayer solitaire.

I have just played the game and was not as impressed as the rating suggested.

The name game of Scthye is much much better. Terra Mystica fails on a number of counts - while the wooden pieces were well made, why not a real fort for the stronghold rather than a block of wood. The different races were not balanced - the flying carpet ability I think is tonnes better than most of the others? etc etc.

RATING: 7
A massive euro for hardcore eurogamers, Terra Mystica doesn’t feature even a scrap of theme apart from the fourteen different races it includes, which are just a pretext to give each player different ways to grind his path to victory by amassing points, thus granting the game an almost unlimited replayability.

Undoubtedly, Terra Mystica is a well conceived game and, unlike most euros, it even seems to somehow forgive mistakes as well: in fact, should you take a false step, you may lose some victory points (as it needs to be) but at least you don’t waste your whole turn (which happens too often in this kind of games) and still have the opportunities to make up over the next few actions.

Anyhow, although it’s a very good game, I still find it too long, cold and demanding for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I'll give credit where it's due.  The way all of the sub systems mesh together to form a cohesive game is impressive.  That being said, this game lacks any sort of fun.  The theme is non exsitstent, you feel constrained for no other reason than because the rules say so and it's sort of a bloated mess.  It's one of those games where you need to do a bit of everything to succeed.  For those brainy types looking to clash wits this will be a delight.  For guys looking for fun with plenty of shitbaggin' and trash talk?  Not so much.

Not a terrible game, but not one I'd be willing to play twice.

PROS:  The mechanics were interesting and unique.  Some of them were similar to those of other games, but changed enough to be unique.

CONS:  I'm not convinced that the races are balanced, and the random phase bonuses can easily favor one race over the others.  There are four different kinds of currency used to advance your race (workers, money, priests, and power) and there always seems to be a lack.  On your turn, you feel very limited which is probably by design.  Still, as you grow your civilization, it doesn't feel like any real progress is being made toward becoming more prosperous.  It seemed everyone was still as frustrated and desperate for currency toward the end as they were at the beginning.  Also, nothing exciting ever happens.  The game just continues the same as it always has, each phase basically the same as the last, with all bonuses being additive with no way of gaining real momentum on any dimension of the game.

// Hadn't played this in quite a while and for some reason
the thought of playing it again seemed really daunting. 
Probably because it's one of the first middle-weight games

than it does now. It's still fun - probably not Top 10
type material, but an interesting area control style game
where planning ahead really matters. I think this would be
a much stronger game with 3 or 4 people rather than 2.

From the initial rules read it seems like a very complicated game, in my opinion these could have been written better.
After the first play turned out to be quite intuitive and very deep for strategy.

Will see how it pans out over time, but seems quite re-playable. Some races do look to be much better than others, but for diversity of play this might be necessary.

Overall was impressed, very good eurogame and might be light enough to get the less seasoned board gamers playing.

RATING: 10
Another great Civ-like game that has elements from other games you recognize but put together in a most innovative way. The faction powers differ in often subtle ways that need to be experienced to understand. There are many moving parts and at first grasping the game may seem daunting, but like many really good designs you play your way into the flow quickly.

Our group was all brand-new to the game (being punched and sorted virtually minutes before the group gathered), but after a relatively brief tour of the environment we waded in and within a round or two felt we were onto it fairly competently. You soon get a good feel for the relative importance of the various methods of exchange (workers, power, priests and money) and we all felt those moments of having just enough of some, more than was entirely necessary of others, and a critical lack of at least one commodity.

It is entirely safe to say that none of us felt we had maximized our faction advantages, or had a confident handle on the economics of the game. Yet, by the game's end (with five players), one of us had lapped the track (halfling) with another not that far behind, and the rest of us spread variously. Everyone expressed the strong desire to play it again soon - always a good sign!

There are not a lot of random elements (just the turn track which can have a fairly large effect on some of the dynamics) and the player interaction is at best indirect (someone snapping an action you really wanted badly, occupying terrain tiles you wanted for expansion, leap-frogging up the cult ladders, having the largest spread etc.). I imagine some would have wished for some combat dice, but I believe the competition is nonetheless real and can be as cutthroat as any "Waro."

It is a very competent design incorporating some of the best features of recent strategy games (Kingdom Builder, Eclipse and Through the Ages come to mind). I have given it a very strong rating after just one play and I'm looking forward to exploring the various factions which will no doubt keep our interest in the short to medium term - the game's staying power through longer term may be the only question here.

I liked this so much more than I was expecting.

Yes it's a euro, and the fantasy theme is a bit weak - there's no combat here and the components are your usual wood houses etc, so you have to work a bit more to get into the thematic side. It is helped by the different races though.

Stuff I like: No luck, no hidden information, different races all a bit different, variable setup (although a variable map would be better, there is a tendency to have prime spots for particular races). Strategic - you need to have a plan, rather than just react.

There is a bit of interaction, although it can be played as a heads down multiplayer solo experience - much like Race for the Galaxy - you'll do better if you keep an eye on what others are doing and adjust your play accordingly, and there IS a reason for being next to your opponents, which is a bit unusual in a euro area control game :)

Overall, pleasantly surprised with this - there's a reason it's so high in the ratings.

*** Update - playing this a lot, and it scales well with the number of players. I'm still enjoying it, and look forward to playing it. Upped my rating to a 10.

Maybe I'll burn out on it and the rating will come down a bit. We'll see.

Good Game with some nice features like the powerpools and the present of individual special abilities in a euro.
But in the end to fiddly and the last round is too long for the game.
The game depth is not that deep. The processeing of a lot of information and icons on little space is the starting burden.

Remembers me a bit of the buildung mechanism and race differences of Eclipse but without combat. And Settlers of Catan for the long term Victory points earning (biggest territory and highest in the cultes), but without trading. With 2 players i must decrease it a full point down to 7 points, because there could quickly occur some leader problem. 
The Artifact Mini-Card-Addon maybe solve the 6th round lonesome gamer problem. So everbody will now pass one or two turns earlier as usual.

I am rating this game a 10 after only one play.    A friend of mine has been wanting me to play this for a long time and I never sat down and gave it the time of day.    I knew it was highly rated, and I love euros, but for some reason it just never landed on my radar.

Well, I played it.   By round two I knew how to play the game (very easy to play), but as each round passed, I fell further and further in love with the depth and strategy the game presents.    Because my friend and I have different primary gaming groups, I went out the next day and bought it along with Fire and Ice.

The replay ability of this game is quite staggering.

Must have game.

Not a bad game.  It feels like Kingdom Builder meets Hansa Teutonica.  There's a lot going on and it is a gamer's game.  However, I won't play it 2-player without a variant and the 3-player game is myeh.  I've played it with 5 and thought it was a very solid Euro and I suspect I'd like it with 4 as well.  Unfortunately, that's probably not a good enough reason to keep it in my collection.

Played at Zuiderspel '15.
My expectations were high (given the rank of TM on BGG), resulting in disappointment. My main complaint concerns the theme. I found the pasted-on alienesque theme of Catan buildings and power pools to be silly and extremely weak. 
Still, Terra Mystica obviously has some very well-interlocking mechanismms, and my rating will likely go up with more plays.

Eurogame puro, con poca interacción. Gestión de recursos para conseguir puntos de victoria. Se trata de construir ciudades, venerar a los elementos, etc con el fin de ir sumando puntos y posicionarse bien para la evaluación final. 

Tiene un sistema de gestión de puntos de poder (magia), muy interesante. Estilo mancala. Mezcla muchas mecánicas de otros juegos, y resulta muy atractivo, aunque es un poco abstracto. Cada jugador lleva una raza y todas son diferentes, cada una con una cualidad. Fue un juego muy esperado y que en general gustó bastante.

Bought this for a total of $49.00 on 2016 Amazon Prime Day. I played through it once at Aether and I really like it. I showed pictures to Allan and he watched Rodney Smith's review of the insert and he later said "I want to play and try it out. So learn it fast" which is exciting!!!!

Update: I've been playing 2 and 3 player games of Terra Mystica against myself and I really like it. I'm not so great at getting good engines going, but I think I'm getting better with practice!

Update 2: I played a 3 player game with Vinny (the nomads) and Emily (the mermaids) and myself (the witches) and Emily crushed us. Sadly I think Vinny did not like the nomads and maybe they are less exciting than some other factions. I feel like the next time I get an intro game going for people I might use the halflings instead but I'm not sure.

A rather intricate system, but it plays quite smoothly once you get the hang of it. A very clever design in which everything seems to fit together pretty well. The "elemental" theme comes across pretty well and the game looks good. I like the trade-off between building near other players (for power and cheaper trading posts) and building away from them (for more land). It's kind of neat to have a land-grabbing game where you're not necessarily upset if someone expands right next to you.

It's a decent enough experience, but in the end I just found it a little bit boring. It feels too much like solving a puzzle for my tastes. While I praised the trading system above, ultimately I'd say this game might just be not interactive enough for me. It doesn't really excite me enough that I want to play it repeatedly. Still, a decent game.

Have played twice now, but my second play was so far removed from my first, I might as well have never played before. And this is a game where you need a few plays before you can have any real competency. It's a true point salad, and the point gaps awarded between first and second on many of the scoring paths heavily reward players who know the game and punish newcomers. Still though, I do want to play again before I completely forget how to play, and see if it isn't more enjoyable.

This gets a 10, even though its heavy, game mechanics are beautifully crafted for an immersive gaming experience. I don't know about balance, except what I have read, but its not apparent that it should be an issue. Tough game to play and learn! My 16 year old son said during the game "this is harder than Agricola." Maybe slightly, but it is just as brilliant a design. I typically am not drawn to heavy games, but this one, like Agricola, offers a huge thematic and mechanical delight with the gameplay that the heaviness doesn't detract. Should be a classic as time will tell. Own Erweiterrungsbogen expansion tiles.

I was so hyped about this game that my initial play was a bit underwhelming. While it is a very solid eurogame, I was expecting much more interaction. This is not the game's fault, but my own expectations. I want to get some more plays in to see if interaction increases with rules familiarity.
-----------------------------------
(Feb 2013) Sold after 5 plays. I have the nagging feeling that once all players are familiar with the game, most choices will be predetermined by races/bonuses, and I have no interest in such puzzle-like games.

(April 2015) Too many GeekBuddies love this game, so I gave in and reacquired a copy to give TM a second chance. My hope is that my gaming tastes might have changed enough in the past two years to like the game now.

RATING: 10
A top tier game. Only my 5th game out of 568 that I have rated a 10.

It is purely a euro and it's on the heavier side. Steep learning curve. Having 14 different ways to play ensures replayability. I can't think of another euro, that after 20+ games, I feel there is still more to explore.

Much more than the usual put a worker here-and-there to collect cubes to convert to veeps.

The play time is excellent at 25 minutes per player.

Update. Raised from 8.5 to 9.0. After 12 plays it is holding up. I'm still interested in exploring new races and looking forward to re-exploring past played races. 

Update. Bumped to a 10. After 16 games, I am still wanting to play more.

Left a positive feeling after first play. There's a lot of choices and options to do. Board, bits and peaces all look good and the flow of the game is very streamlined.

Games does take a lot of time to play and there are quite a few small but important rules to be remembered which I find a bit tedious.

Waiting to play more.

EDIT:

After couple of more plays I'll increase the rating to 8. This game is absolutely marvelous even if it's a bit too long for my taste (and time resources at the moment).

First impressions: a lot harder to teach than play.  Many mechanisms taken from many different games, multiple resources, two of which track differently, variable player powers, with more unlockable during the game -- it's a lot to explain.  But in play, it seems to flow pretty easily, and the players catch on quickly.  Definitely warrants more play.  Can be a bit AP-prone, though, and while it's an impressive achievement, I think I prefer the relatively straightforward play of, say, Tzolk'in.  

P.S.: The rules are horribly laid out, with things like where to get power and how the cult tracks work explained in bizarre places.  This is a big-ticket item; someone should have spent more time editing the rulebook.

Wonderful, eminently replayable game, fully deserving of its top ten status on BGG. The mechanics are complex yet intuitive, combining multiple levels of area majority with worker placement mechanics (i.e power actions) and special powers. 

The various races, of course, make the game. Each race doesn't merely give a special power: they totally change the way you have to play, focusing your strategy in dratically different ways depending on which race you are. Amazingly, with all of this, the game seems to be remarkably balanced (ok, with a couple of exceptions for people who have played hundreds of times). It's hard to imagine the amount of playtesting this game must have gone though before going to print. An exceptional design.

UPDATE: Ok, so the game is not balanced. But it's still amazing. To prevent imbalances, either auction off races at the beginning of the game (using VPs) or pair equally-weighted factions with each other before play.

RATING: 6
There is fun to be had Terra Mystica, certainly. But to me, it's a classic overdesigned, mechanics-centric euro - not a good thing. For all the ridiculous and unwarranted flak he takes, Knizia's games are both mechanically elegant and are (usually) thematically coherent and have both intellectual and emotional hooks. Terra Mystica is a pretty dry, incoherent mess of interlocking mechanics that gives you little to get invested in. It also lacks anything in ongoing player interaction; there are usually just a couple points of entirely predictable high-stakes conflicts early but it in the main is much more of a multiplayer solitaire tableau-builder than the positioning/placement game it superficially resembles. I think solitaire-y tabeleau-builders can work (Terraforming Mars is decent) but it's a really hard problem; without the energy of at least a little  competition (whether it's the inter-player competition of Power Grid, cooperative competition with a game system like Lord of the Rings or Pandemic, or a mix of the two like Greenland),  games have to work really hard to maintain engagement. Terra Mystica doesn't manage it.

The lack of any kind of ingame randomization is also a huge problem. With everything about the game state known before turn 1, it really does inflict a brutal level of look-ahead type analysis - to the point of requiring you to plot out your first 3 turns, half the game, before you even claim a faction if you want to be competitive.

On the flip side, I did find all the different factions entertaining to explore, in a solitaire-y kind of way (which faction you pick is a big deal for you personally, but they don't seem to produce interesting interactions which is kind of surprising). This is definitely not nothing, and it was enough for me to enjoy the game for about half-a-dozen plays. But for me, once I got through the exploratory phase, there wasn't enough left to keep me going.

There are a number of games that for me are sort of in this design space and which I find much superior: 504, Taj Mahal, Ginkopolks, Through the Desert, El Capitain (all 10-rated games for me). They're all fairly different from Terra Mystica mechanically, but they capture some key element or elements in a far more elegant, higher-octane package. 504 has the truly almost infinite diversity and sense of designing a strategy before turn 0 based on a unique landscape; Taj Mahal has the combination of long-term planning based on a known series of events and a placement game; Ginkopolis and Through the Desert have the interesting space competition that involves tight maneuvering against your neighbors, with Ginkopolis throwing in tableau-building; and El Capitain really captures an interesting sense of coopitition as two players competing to exploit a market make it worth more for both in the short term, until the market gets played out. Terra Mystica doesn't really manage to do any of these things all that well, so I'd much rather play a game that does one or a couple things extremely well than a game that tries to do too much and doesn't really manage it.

Terra Mystica is one of the latest and greatest in the "point salad" variety of games, where players score points for all sorts of things, hoping to have the best total by the end of the game.

The coolest thing about Terra Mystica is that every player is playing a different races of beings, which changes the way that player approaches the game.  Some players will be far more interested in certain aspects of the game than others due to their special abilities which encourage players to take different paths.

However, your plans will definitely intersect plans of other players, allowing you to frustrate other players' plans and vice versa.

Overall, just a really neat game if you don't mind a mild amount of complexity and like these sorts of "points everywhere" games.

After a few more plays I've raised my rating slightly.  It's a good game, especially at 3-4, but I've found it doesn't work as well at 5 because of the time and heavy thought required.

[floatleft][ImageID=1450866][/floatleft][size=11][b][thing=120677]Terra Mystica[/thing][/size][/b] surprised me with its accessibility and speed of play.  A middle-weight game bordering on elegant is the last thing I would have expected from a collaberation between designers of [thing=13884][/thing] and [thing=20101][/thing].  Yet [thing=120677][/thing] most evokes memories of austere predecessors, such as [thing=43015][/thing] and [thing=107529][/thing].  That is not to say that [thing=120677][/thing] is uncomplicated -- it layers numerous ideas (indeed, one might argue a few too many) that require some time to wade through.  But the game progresses in a wave of quick turns featuring discrete and clearly defined options in pursuit of a handful of simple and well-understood goals.  

[floatright][ImageID=1458783][/floatright]In all honesty, [thing=120677][/thing] is mechanically most reminiscent of 2011's [thing=72125][/thing], though I hesitate to introduce the comparison because I feel that it may mislead more than it illuminates.  The game begins by adopting defined races with unique special abilities, it progresses through players' management of multiple currencies tied to a [thing=25613][/thing] style tech tree for further specialization, all in the pursuit of developing and then competing on a shared central board. 

Unlike [thing=72125][/thing], however, that seemed to build toward the culmination of just one or two strategies, [thing=120677][/thing] provides myriad opportunities to score points through a diffuse network of interrelated actions.  [floatleft][imageid=1450487][/floatleft]This seems to result simultaneously the blank canvas of a Jack-friendly sandbox game and the general dread that everything is necessary and nothing is quite sufficient.  Players can and will develop different skills, pursue different scoring opportunities, and yet continue to compete for (and complain about) the same fundamental building blocks.  It works in a way that I would not have expected upon just reading the rules.

I will be very curious to see how the game holds up over repeated plays.  Most importantly to me, I am interested in seeing whether increased player skill results in a more efficient pursuit of strategic paths, and, if so, what tax those efficiencies might levy on player interaction (which was quite high in our first game). 

If sufficient quantities of the game are available, I am confident that [thing=120677][/thing] will end up being one of the defining titles of this year's Spiel fair.

Many strategy games suffer from one of the three evils: its all math and too little theme and immersion; or too many convoluted rules and feature that don't add any gameplay value; or they just have so much stuff in them - they take 6+ hours to play (yeah I am looking at you Twilight Imperium). Finding a well balanced strategy/development/area control game with good theme and reasonable gameplay is a challenge for me, and Terra Mystica is one of such rare games. There is some issues that some of the races a bit too weak, while some a bit too good, but over its a good strategy game that can be played in a reasonable time frame.

Just a fantastic Euro that is totally deserving of the hype and its rating. I love that the bonuses for each round are known from the beginning to allow you to develop a long-term strategy from the get go while taking advantage of your factions powers. The 14 asymmetrical factions included in the base game give it great replayability. Terra Mystica is definitely heavy and will most likely require a few games before fully grasping the strategy needed to win. I look forward to many more games!

"Forced" Patricia and Aeris to play a three-hour game at Dice House Games. I loved the game, but I didn't think I'd be able to get them to play again.

I bought the Daedalus Productions wooden insert.

Aeris took to the game after learning how to play, but Patricia still doesn't like the game much. Yuan is hoooked.

I'm looking at getting the expansion eventually.

The economy on your player board is so clear and understandable. Every action causes something else to be affected, so it's like reading a trend graph when making decisions. The area control decisions are fantastic, and it grows at a steady pace, with the exception of the amazing jumps that using magic correctly can bring about. I have played it several times, won a few times, and feel like I have barely scratched the surface of what is quite frankly a marvelous game.

RATING: 4
When strategies meet. I suspect that the first level of this game is to simply figure out the best strategy for playing any particular race, while the second level would be how to implement your strategy in the way that best interferes with the other players depending on their races.

The question is, is that first level interesting enough for me that I'll end up encountering the second level?

And the likely answer is, no. The game is really way more complicated than I want it to be for the potential fun it delivers. Said another way, there are games I enjoy way more that are easier to play (but offer the same level of challenge during play in the same amount of time at the same player counts).

This really is an excellent deep game. It's only a 7 because the amount of options veers into "overwhelming" territory for me (SO much to track, and small mistakes can have BIG consequences). I'm sure if I played it regularly so I didn't have that emotional response anymore, my rating would be higher. Really, if you're looking for a deep Euro, this absolutely worth your time.

The resource game is excellent - this is resource scarcity at its finest. The way you can control your output is fascinating, and is the main driver for the game's tension. It ties neatly into the classic Euro so many options, not enough time to do them all angst.

Getting new powers as you progress gives you lots of little mini-goals to look forward to and plan toward, and keeps things engaging even over a 2 hour game.

The racial abilities are fun but... don't seem balanced. In our first play, one player's ability seemed straight up OP while another was clearly weaker than anyone else's at the table, and it felt like it had a really big impact on the winner. A shame as the racial powers are one of the cooler aspects of the thing.

There's also a big potential for downtime here, just because there's SO MUCH to consider on each turn, and warning: optimizing your next turn can require a lot of math.

The magic system is just straight up cool. Especially being able to permanently burn some mana to get some NOW.

I really would love to see a stripped down version of this, with less information to track (maybe omitting the cult track, etc) as the base resource game is SO enjoyable on its own that I think it'd make a solid 1 hour game.

If you like heavy Euros and are willing to work around some possibly unbalanced player powers, definitely give this one a go.

An interesting design for people who like competitive puzzle solving.  The variation provided by different game setups and different tools available to each player (the factions) allows repeatable game play.

It is important to note that this game is an economic-optimizer-snowball game.  This means that the strategy you set for yourself before the game starts (how do you expect to solve the puzzle?) and the first two rounds are crucial.  Come from behind victories are rare.

RATING: 5
 The rules are slightly convoluted but it makes sense after a round or two. The variable player powers are very subtle, but the differences in gameplay are huge. It works very well. It has to be impossible for them to be balanced, but they are selected so it shouldn't be that huge of a deal, and it would take a bunch of plays to figure it out anyway.

Edit: reading about the massive imbalances (30 pt differences. - Really?!) in races from online games data kinda bums me out. 

Update: The fact that I am still messing up some rules (connection and adjacency) in my head on a 3rd play really makes me believe the game is overly complicated, and the game has a spatial element that is somewhat offputting to me. 

Plus, despite sharing a board, there aren't that many opportunities to screw with other people's plans (there are some) that it plays much more like an individual board puzzle optimization solitaire game than it seems at first blush.

Terra Mystica is one of the best modern boardgame in these days. It is my personal favorite game alongside with Troyes, the only reason that Terra mystica doesn’t be in my top three becuase its doesn’t scale well with 2-3 players. Which is the numbers of my regular gaming group nowadays. 

However, Terra Mystica is a go to game if I have a group of 4-5 players. A must have in every collection!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
Terra Mystica is my second favorite game right after Agricola - and that's after having played a 1000 different games! There's just so much I really, really love about this game!

The 14 different factions (20 incl. expansion), the power bowls system, the complete lack of randomness, the various bonus and round tiles, the map design, the founding of cities, the whole economic aspect, the game flow and overall just the deep gameplay that can be found in this truly awesome game!

There is absolutely no randomness in the game once the initial setup has been done, so it all comes down to the players' strategies. From here on out, it's all up to the players and which actions they take, and even though as I said there is no randomness, the choices each player takes can have a huge impact on your own strategy and what you're able to do; it's in no way a game with a solitaire feel, at least not when you play with 4 or 5. With 3 it's a little less tight, and with 2 it's probably too lose and you can do more or less whatever you want.

As said, the setup is random and makes sure that every game play out slightly differently, mainly because you get points for doing different stuff in different rounds, so in some games it might be a good idea to build a Stronghold in turn 1, in others it might not be wise until later on. It all depends. And this also influences your choice of faction, as some of them play radically different! This also means that, while the game isn't won before the game starts, it might actually be lost if a player takes a sucky race compared to the round bonuses... Speaking of sucky races, there's no denying that the races aren't equally balanced, and the Fakirs are extremely poor; lower starting power, more expensive SH etc. makes them almost unplayable, but in certain situations they might shine (err, not be as bad as usual). But, having played TM over 50 times, that's not necessarily a bad thing, because I can then pick a somewhat bad race (Fakirs, Auren, Giants come to mind) if I play against new players so the game is more balanced.

One minor nitpick I have is that I don't like the starting player system of the starting player being determined by the player passing first and then going clockwise around; if one player is having a bad game and don't have much income etc., he will usually pass first, and this gives the second player a (too big) advantage I think, as especially power actions are of critical importance later on in the game (who said 7 gold)).
Also, another negative is probably that Earth1 (and Air1?) is a bit too strong if you can get it early on, but I've both lost with it and won over other players who had it, and it's certainly not "mandatory" (otherwise nobody would win as the 4(+5)th player in 4(5) player games). I actually prefer myself to get other favor tiles that boost my income, but each to his own - and again, it depends on which faction you have chosen and how you play it!

I will elaborate further later on, because TM is just an incredible game that every hardcore eurogamer should play! I'm almost addicted to it, and it keeps getting better and better each time I play and learn new things!

RATING: 3.5
Deeply dissapointed by this one. With 2 players, it's just plain bad - boring, repetitive, and the different factions don't add more variance, but just determine your (only possible) winning strategy.
With three players, it didn't improve much.

RATING: 7
I find the optimization exercise in this game to be pretty satisfying. The lack of player interaction outside of the occasional blocking move is a little bit of a downside, but the bigger downside for me is the factions having semi-set optimal building/tech tree strategies to follow that I can never remember because I don't own this game and rarely play it.

After one play, I really want to play again and try out the different factions.  Good interplay between the mechanics (tech building, engine building, and board position).  Also provides a good bit of that feeling of having a lot of stuff do on a turn but not having even close to enough resources to do it all, so decisions must be made.  The Power buckets are innovative and so is the desire to be near other people to get power.  The passing mechanic is also well done.  I really enjoy that your actions are not limited by others passing and your resources are kept between rounds. This makes it so you can easily get done next turn what you want to do this turn; it doesn't hurt that much to pass for a bonus scroll.

RATING: 5.5
I can see the rave, but to me this game is being a bit overly complex without proportional rewards.  It is also a bit abstract in how the area control/benefit works.  There are a lot of things going on with multiple way to scores victory, which generally I don't mind but in this game just seems a bit boring and mind numbing.


Granted it's only 1 play and I did do quite badly, associated with a high learning curve, so I'm willing to try this again.

So, I got a chance to play "the new hotness." And, my opinion of a first play is "eh--not bad." 

Terra Mystica was dryer than I expected. I had heard comparisons to Dominant Species (which in retrospect don't make much sense to me) so I was expecting at least a bit of theme with the game. It's not really there. The different race powers are instead paths to pursue optimization. 

There are things to like. All the mechanics are smooth, the different races provide replayability, you get to play in your own little playground before the end game pushes people into each other for final point mooching. Something is missing though that keeps this from being a game that I get excited about. 

I need to play it once more. One play makes this game hard to judge, as I had no idea what I was shooting to accomplish at the start of the game. Now that I know, I wonder if a more informed play changes my thoughts.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]An excellent euro implementation of area control which has a lot of paths to victory.

An excellent area control game.  Take on the role of the leader of a race and terraform the world so that your people can spread and build.

There are a dizzying array of options for players to choose from.  Each race has its own abilities and costs.  The general ability in the 3-bowl magic systems allows players to convert their power to workers or jostle for once-per-turn abilities on the board.

The semi-random scoring for actions performed in a given round -- chosen when the game starts -- pushes players to pursue different lines of strategy each time they play.

I cannot recommend this game highly enough.  It is outstanding.  The only caveat is that it's a heavy Eurogame, with all that entails.

The map is not for 2 players but too much downtime for 4-5 players.

I've played this a number of times. It starts out interesting. The more I play it the less I want to play it more.

Near the end of the game there are often a bunch of different ways to get the same number of points. Interactions with other players thus enable some strategy, and it's clearly very well balanced. I much prefer when that's the way the game is at the beginning but a series of moves end up adding up to a lot more differences in points for later moves. That doesn't seem to happen.

It would also be nice if the board layout wasn't the same every time. This becomes more balanced than say Settlers (though it's in a different class of games anyway), but much less interesting from one game to the next.

I've been looking at this game for the past 5 years as it has become one of the most beloved heavier Euro games. I'm glad to have finally had a chance to play it. The rules explanation was long (30+ minutes), and I was not completely grasping how all of the many mechanics fit together. However, after the first turn, it (mostly) all clicked and was a blast. I loved the many choices you had each round in balancing which building you had out (and therefore what resources you got each round) and your power pools while racing the other players for space on the board, bonus tiles, and elemental tracks. I would love to play again with the training wheels off to allow everyone their own choice on one of the 14 species.

RATING: 7.9
Very cool.  Eclipse + HT + special sauce.  Lots of delicious blocking and cool interaction.  The game itself is wonderful and, as a bonus, there are fourteen very different races.  The two players is fun, but a little limited.  I imagine the game really opens up with four or five skilled players.  

I'll need at least five or six more plays  at all the player counts to settle on a rating but here's a hopeful 8.  There may be a 9 here, but, if the strategic interaction doesn't amount to anything, it could slide down.  Eclipse has fared well over the year, I hope this one will too.

Update:
TM differentiates itself from most currency converters by allowing more mixed strategies in the early and mid-game and then, as the game winds up, constraining the possible end-game options (expanding cults or area). In short, not everything converts and the big "cash cows" for victory points require positional strength rather than finely-tuned engines. I should add that the game did not seem like this after the first few plays. Then, in the most recent game we played races that were close to each other on the terraforming track. This made the game much more mean, and more interesting. 

I haven't mentioned races much and actually, I think they are mostly a curious inconvenience. They seem well balanced which is remarkable given their variety but parsing each race is an impediment to good play. The game would be just as interesting (maybe more so) if everyone played the same race.

Update: 10+ plays in the game is still good, but is beginning to feel a little solitary.  

Update: A few more plays are confirming some of my fears.  It is much harder to block and interact with skilled players.  The most interesting relationships in this game are with non-players (the various conversions).  There is little sense of a "game" and very few ways to manage incentives.  In short, it's a conversion puzzle performed in proximity--but at least it's a mildly enjoyable puzzle.

Great Euro style area control game with lots of re-playability. Excellent instruction booklet which has very helpful first play scenarios for 3, 4 or 5 players.

Plan on a solid 20 or so minutes to teach before you play but this game is picked up by people quickly.

Game does a nice job of balancing long term strategy with shorter term tactical moves. The balance between in-game scoring & end-game scoring is also good - not too swingy but not insignificant either.

First, ignore the theme on this game.  If you are turned off by elves, giants, and magic, don't let that stop you from playing this masterpiece.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a epic tale of high fantasy, keep looking.
BGG might as well put a picture of this next to the definition of "Pasted on theme".

Once you get past that, you get a great game with many interesting decisions.  It borrows from Peurto Rico with selecting a role each turn.  It borrows from Eclipse by having remove cubes from your personal tableau to reveal higher production.  And then it has some twists unique to itself.  Every time I play, I marvel at how well everything fits together.

This game is very fun. I really like the mana system, which feels very unique. I don't play it much, but that's mostly because I mostly play games with two players, and I'm not a huge fan of this game with two players.

Since I have got this game, me and my wife have been playing it every time we had the chance. Is one of the very few games that we never tire of.
It is a little bit like playing chess, but funnier.

So many factions (we have the expansion as well) and different turn tiles/bonus tiles guarantee that no two games are the same. No luck involved, a heavy Eurogame that requires some mental calculations and a higher attention level than many other "lighter" games, but really worth it.

After a month of owning it, it is already the most played game in our collection!

This is a preliminary rating, and I expect (hopefully) that it will go up with repeat playings. But my first impression was that the game was over-long, and that I found the player interaction leaving me wanting something more direct. It felt like an overhyped Euro. I really hope there is something to justify the early enthusiasm for this game, but I didn't detect it during my first exposure.

The Chinese text looks cool (in my opinion), but rule book is Chinese. Otherwise, the game is language independent. And importantly, numerals in the Chinese edition are Arabic/European (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.), not Chinese. Only other language in game are the faction names on faction cards (which are in Chinese).

The game is in very good condition. Played a number of times with my wife, but we aren't rough with our board games (and the game this game is very robust with very solid components).

I think this might be the game that fully demonstrates that I'm not really a Euro gamer per se anymore at all, or at least that I'm well past my point of being excited by them. So take this with a grain of salt.

But basically this is a connection game somewhat ala Through the Desert or Kingdom Builder with a huge heaping pile of extra Euro mechanics (primarily a dual economy of cash and mystical power) added to it that allow players to score points on an additional series of tracks instead of just on the board.

On a given turn players generally gather some wood, transform a hex into a land type that their character finds attractive, or burn some mystical power to make connections easier, towns affordable, or the like. Players seem to score most of their points by having long contiguous groups, by dominating the special tracks, and by placing whatever the special round tile is incentivizing (i.e.: VPs for building this type of wood building, &c., a different one is up each round).

The upside of this design is definitely the variability that the different tribal groups provide, as each board has its set of special characteristics (and presumably, dominant strategies to pursue; this in itself is not appealing to me because it also likely means that players are having a path laid for them that they would be foolish to ignore).

For whatever reason, I initially found this game difficult to learn, though it was fairly easy to play in practice. The plus side is the aforementioned variability, the downside is that this is longer, perhaps too long for this type of game for my particular tastes. Pure Euro fans seems to love it though, and I can at least understand that (compare to games like Hansa Teutonica where said love utterly mystifies me) and would play this again with an experienced group but I'm not sure the extra stuff really makes it any better than Kingdom Builders (a much shorter game) for me.

Amazing game. It's very cool the mechanic that let you spread your race all over the map to get more influence on the game world. Many different races have their own differences on how to spread in different lands and how to earn victory ponits for the end game. That gives you such a huge replayability for many gameplays. Also, it's very important to think that every race is perfectly balanced with the others one, so the skill is all about on how you can manage it and be better on this than your opponents. Really funny and deep game to play with a good group of hardcore gamers!

A mid to heavy weight game (economic and area control with  significant depth of strategy in planning your expansion to score maximum points along the way). 

The game played really well. The gameplay itself is nothing particularly unique and I can't help thinking they could have come up with a better theme (or at least integrated it better into the game), however what I think will make this game different from other heavier euros is its replayability. While the game board is static, there are 14 different factions which can be played (all with different special powers/abilities). Combined with the variable bonus tiles and round scoring tiles this will create a genuinely unique game each time you play. Looking forward to playing again.

Players create cities on the game board while advancing on the cult tracks.  Players choose a race.  Races have variable powers and prefer different territories.  Advantages can be gained by building certain buildings to gain favor tiles or per-round privileges.  Having buildings in play provides various sorts of income each round.  Advancing on the cult tracks can help cycle power, provide round-end bonuses, and end game points.  End game points are also awarded for city size.

It may sound dry, but it's quite interesting.  The variable powers of each race help the game feel fresh each time.

Update: 10!

Ok, this game is amazing. Reminds me of the amazement when I first played Settlers 15+ years ago. Having played so many games since then, it's hard to have a game hit me with that much excitement. This has the hex map with different terrain types, the different buildings with upgradability, multiple resource types, land grab to build on spots before other players, and then about 37 other different things. But they all work. I wouldn't remove any of them. And then you not only get points for what you build, but there is an end game scoring based on connectedness, worth tons of points. Having only played a few times so far, I still stink at the game, but it absolutely captivates me.

I generally am not a fan of zero-randomness games. The exception is when the game provides significant variety of setup options (e.g. Luna). This game delivers that in spades. I love that there are more factions to play than max players. Right there that's 35 different faction combinations for 4 players, not even counting rotating who is playing which factions. 
---
Preliminary rating after one play. Lots to explore here. Seems like it will take many games to really get a strong grasp of all the nuances, especially with all the different races with the unique attributes. So many possibilities, I can't really figure out how I feel, other than I look forward to playing more. Will definitely pick up, unless someone else in my group does first.

I was never too impressed with Terra Mystica, and frankly I doubt a little that the game would have fared so well as it did if Uwe Rosenberg hadn't been there to lend his author status to the two designers Jens and Helge. The game would still have done very well to excellent on its own, I think... but at the same time there are hordes of designers who'd give their reproductive organs for such an endorsement. 

The game is unusual in that it is combinatorial after the setup, which is an impressive achievement in its own right. Of course it presses all the right buttons with asymmetric faction powers (and thus also questions as to their inherent balance, which several years after the game was released are agreed upon to be [i]un[/i]balanced, even if there is always some speculation by how much) and a fantasy setting. Of course once you're playing the kitschy back story disappears into the background; and all you end up doing is working out how to transform the various opportunities into VPs, power, money, and other resources like buildings. Thinking of buildings as resources is unusual, but once placed they don't really do much, and given that they leave and enter your supply in a controlled fashion leaves little to treat them as anything other than a resource. In this Terra Mystica proves itself to be something of a button pusher, but fortunately a relatively easily accessible one as the actions are fairly logically grouped together. 

After my first few games I'm not so sure that there is much player creativity and interaction to be found in the whole. The faction powers determine in some way or form how you are going to play the game; deviate from them at your own peril. Then the round bonuses are too attractive to ignore either, so you'd be a fool not to try to match up your actions to them. If you're not doing it, other people most certainly are! At some point you even begin to harbour a bit of a point-salady feel because there's always some easily obtainable carrot dangling in front of you. So certainly the interaction will have bite, right? Well... I'm not so sure. Interaction is primarily handled through Power, a rather fleeting resource which, although useful, isn't particularly ubiquitous either. Adding insult to injury, it costs VP to obtain it. It really takes a while to get anywhere with the stuff, and because most people tend to build in each other's vicinity the net result isn't far from 0 either (although the eventual purpose may differ). Blocking area expansion through the erection of buildings, or construction of a bridge before someone else can, is as in-your-face as it's going to get. For all intents and purposes this game is very friendly indeed; and it probably also explains why at 5 it still functions admirably: there is simply little interaction to deal with. This is a far cry from, say, a Splotter game.

So what are we left with? A simple, but very contrived majorities game on the side board, and a very elaborate dance of conceptually simple resource conversion with some area control on the main board, all packaged up in an ensemble of euro-friendliness. It's not unlike many titles What's Your Game? has put out, but then without the clunky feel that publisher seems to have a nose for. Still, I daresay that game-wise you'd be better off picking games which either do the majorities right, or the resource conversion, or the area control. Sometimes these aspects are even found in one single package. Terra Mystica doesn't offer much in terms of compensation for its much longer playing time and more elaborate ruleset, and that is costing the game my appreciation of it.

I've pondered a while about my rate for the thing. My initial rate was a 5, but given that it plays 5 people just as easily as it does 3 (even if it cheats in how it achieves this complex design feat), I've gone and upped the rate to 6. But that's where the rate will stay. Apart from the faction balance, the game works as intended... it's just not that spectacular if you look through the pink haze.

In this game players have two areas to fight over. One is the land and the other is the control of the four elements. Players build structures to gain more control over both. After six rounds players score points based upon largest built settlements and elemental control. Some in game scoring occurs and should not be discounted as it is some sixty percent of the score. I would rate higher, but it does not have a trading phase.

There is a LOT going on in this game. You can tell just by the weight of the box. Explaining the rules is a bit of a challenge, because there are just so many options for players which can be confusing (check out a teaching tool here on BGG!).

But the gameplay itself starts to coalesce after a few turns and you can see your options ahead of you. The artwork and components are top notch. I like that with fewer players it's a relatively short game considering its depth.

Definitely looking forward to more plays - I expect my rating will creep up over time.

I particularly love how the game provides incentives for proximity to other players on the board, thus eliminating the feature most other multiplayer games with an area control mechanic have: If two players fight over control of an area, this is usually to the advantage of the other players. I don't like the problems associated with this at all and therefore regard Terra Mystica's take on it as a huge accomplishment.

I love the game's [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2015/variable-player-powers]Variable Player Powers mechanic[/url] as well.

A downside (which prevented me from rating it even higher) is that the game seems to be especially unforgiving of mistakes. Particularly early mistakes can more or less ruin your entire game, which can be a problem for a game which lasts as long as Terra Mystica. The "need" to plan ahead very carefully resulting from that can feel a little tiresome. I hope it'll decrease with more experience, though.

It first came across from rules as a "you can do your own thing" game, but thankfully it's more interactive than that - partly for the blocking (both in building locations and in taking the special mana actions) and in anticipating where other people are going to build for purposes of gaining mana. Yet there's enough internal-engine development to satisfy that portion of my brain. (Edit: after playing more I find it overall slightly too punishing in that regard; tiny slip-ups early can cascade down the turns, making for lots of AP in early-game as players try to not do that.)

The varied "gain VP for this arbitrary thing" bonuses do very nice things for variability of play (changing incentives game-to-game), but also feel really arbitrary. I would have appreciated a thematic wrapper of some sort, even a really thin one. (Actually, that's true for a lot of things in this game.)

Takes a whole bunch of simple mechanics, borrows from a few games we know and love, and gives you a good brain wracking time.  

The interaction between players and how it influences your decisions is excellent, and creates a very interesting dynamic.  Every move seems to have a weight behind it, and resources need to be well managed.  

Very engrossing and lots of fun.

Virtually flawless; definitely one of the best games I've ever played. The 14 factions give it tons of replay value, and the different strategies (all of which can be effective if played right, depending on the other players) are so deep and complex. Absolutely phenomenal game.

I remember seeing this game and thinking it looked interesting, then a couple weeks later I got the chance to try it out.

I loved it. I like the mechanics, the theme and the style of play. It's a nice heavier game, that has a good range of options to pick from as you play.

I feel the game rewards clever thinkers, looking for advantage and ways to use the options to their best.

The only reason I'm marking it a 9 instead of a 10 is the heavier nature of the game means there will be times that playing it wouldn't be suitable.

This is Catan for adults.  You won't ever need to play settlers after playing this game.  It is strategic and tactical at the same time.  Tons of races, a lot of points to score during the game and at the end as well.  It's a very organic network connection game.  It will hurt your brain but in a way that won't give you a tumor.  The theme is a bit paste-on but I could give a rip because the gameplay is just awesome.

Got this as a birthday gift. Yay! A heavier weight classic from my wife who is looking forward to playing it. Let us see how this goes... She did a lot of research!

This is a rare game that makes me want to use a rating in between two numbers. For now it's going to stay a 6, but I think over time this rating may go up as the subtleties of gameplay come out with more plays.

But for me, I guess I am a themeaholic. This game's theme is rather tacked on to a deeper Euro style. That's great, and obviously people love this game a lot for it's gameplay. As I said, I'm a themeaholic...

Clearly well thought out mechanics and balance- and a good blend of direct/indirect competition.

Long setup and cleanup time, though. But once you go, you go and just play- little downtime (at least in my group) so that is good.

When I first played this game, I thought "what is all this buzz about?". I didn't like it at all, I didn't see any strategic challenges and never wanted to play it again. But since it's the favourite game of one of my best friends, he convinced me playing it again. Only after the third or fourth game, I started to see light in the darkness. A world of possibilities opened itself. And suddenly, I thought "wow, what a game!". Now it's one of my favourite games as well! :-)

Very interesting area control. Difficult decisions, unique racesm
Only minor complaint is when a person builds next to you, you have to decide if you want to trade VP for mana. This often makes the game stop for 5 minutes as the person agonizes over thus minor decision.

A superb game! More I play it, more I want to play... I played 13 games until now and every game was as different as could have been because of the different races, deifferent setup, different bonuses... I didn't give it a 10 because it seems to me that some races are better (easier) than others...AP could happen a lot, especially from the 3rd or 4th round of the game.
I like very much that it can be played in 5 players and, even with this number, it can be finished in aprox. 3 hours...I heard something about an expansion and I can tell you right now it's a must for me already! :)

Recommended for 2-5 players, best with 4. 60-150 minutes, heavy

Played two games to get to know the game, and on one hand I can see why people like this so much, on the other hand I'm not sure this will be played a lot as we usually play with 2. As you need to be close to other players, more players would be better than just two. This also depends on your race of course.

Have found a good online platform to play this. Although poor graphics, gameplay is quite alright.

Terra Mystica is a great one.  The unique player powers and bonuses are well done.  The terraforming is implemented well, which makes a simple board very interesting.  The power mechanics a lot of fun.  And the bonus tiles you select from performing game actions can really mix things up.

Huge replay value.  Huge fun.  This is a must own.

Any game that keeps each player completely on the edge of their seat deserves a 10 in my book. We played it and each person used a different strategy. Some people closely followed the score cards, others did their own thing and we still had no idea who would win at the end of the game. Amazing.

Excellent, thinky euro, one of the best games in recent years. Each race requires a different strategy, and the combination of races in the game means every game is a new challenge.

Update: I feel that Gaia Project makes a great game even better. So I’ve put TM up for trade/sale.

RATING: 8.4
Entire game breathes the fantasy theme. Many ways of scoring points while developing your "nation" by means of 14 different races each with their own properties. One flaw in the game: there is only 1 way to build a bridge, and this action can only be chosen by 1 player in each of the 6 game rounds. This limits the amount of bridges built throughout the game to a maximum of 6. This is strange, as all other actions can be performed in different ways (power actions, bonus tiles, bonus scrolls, building a city, bonus castle action).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme is anchored well into the structure of the game, with each faction operating very distinctly.  I believe this is what's earned it so much praise.  It's well made and has excellently tuned mechanics and balance, and yet for me it feels like yet another samey area control game with an especially dull fantasy theme.  And that's somehow just not my cup of tea right now.  I don't want to look at my game shelf and see a dozen nearly identical fantasy area control games.  I want something interesting and different that screams to be played.

RATING: 8
Initial placeholder ranking of an 8, but if I can get this one to the table more and get to the point where I can compete well enough, this might eventually end up a 10.

Update: I think TM needs to stay at an 8, for now. I envy those who think of it as a 10; I truly wish I was one of them. TM really needs lots of play to reveal just how great it is -- the seemingly infinite combinations of the various asymmetrical factions matching up against each other is something I can only imagine instead of having experienced first hand. And there in lies the problem: I've too many games that get in the way of the time and attention Terra Mystica deserves, so I suspect the best parts of TM will forever remain hidden to me. 

For me personally, TM is not an intuitive experience. Watching others puzzle through their faction's strengths and succeed only makes worse the frustration I feel not being able to lift the fog of indecision that envelops me each turn of the game. For some, TM simply clicks, but I'll never be one of those people. To better understand, I've started playing some games against the AI at http://lodev.org/tmai so as to learn from each turn's suggested hints, but I can already tell the methods shown will probably never occur to me naturally. Still, I love playing the game despite my lack of success.

RATING: 8.3
Don´t get me wrong - Terra Mystica is a very good game, a medium/heavy euro with lots of planning, decisions and options to be made and multiple ways of gaining points. The power bowls is also a complete and ingenious new mechanic.
However, the almost endless options with multiple development tracks, plus the different skills of 14 factions, can be somehow overwhelming. The scatter can be so huge that there can be several tracks a player never has time to start, or there can even be a game where there is a track where nobody has put one single effort!...The feeling is that one could have played 50 games and still have little notion of what is the best to do. 
The theme (if there is one) is very fuzzy and the board artwork could be better, though the components are of good quality.
So, if someone asks me if i like the game, i would say "yes", but if they ask me if i wanna play it, i would say "meh...i would rather play something else!"

One of those "everything but the kitchen sink" games. This is a heavy, long Euro, and is sort of difficult to categorize, mechanics-wise, as it has so many. There's nothing particular exciting or novel here, but there doesn't have to be either. It does what it does well, and that is provide an enjoyable gaming experience. The theme is non-existent, but if you can get past that, then the game can be fun, although it can feel a little long for my taste if players suffer from AP (likely).

NUMBER ONE!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
All the hype seems justified up to a point. A heavy game of figuring out your best actions in order to make best use of your race's ability to terraform is the crux of the game and you have to wade through understanding all the different actions and ways to make points in order to do so effectively. The choice on where to expand and when and how it gives an effectively free resource to players is not as interesting as a choice as I first thought it would be.

Terraforming in the game can feel ponderous in the beginning. A game for highly competitive people without the direct combat that I really love in competitive games. Still a good challenge of a game and decently fun.

Really want to dig this game but I am not totally sold. My wife and I desperately want a non-aggressive "civish" game and were hoping this would fit the bill. After multiple plays we still get one or two little rules wrong which end up greatly affecting end game scoring. I feel the rulebook is badly organized and not detailed enough to facilitate in-game searches. The pacing seems off too - games starts slow and just when I feel I'm building up some momentum the game abruptly ends. I'm almost certain the majority of my issues stem from only playing it with two. It could be its just not a good two player game.

A bit complex for a Euro and a lot to keep track of.  AP is downright painful. Have sat for 15 minutes doing nothing while opponents figure out what to do.  I don't feel like I'm expanding my territory.  What do tHe priests have to do with anything?  I won first game I played.  In the 2nd game I played I didn't play the 1st turn well and when 2nd turn started I knew I would come in last place (4 player game) and sat for over 2.5 hours waiting for it to end.  That's terrible game design. Something missing here. Have no desire to play again.

I was not impressed with this game. We played with 5 and the rules were explained fairly well. The problem is so much the rules or how things work but the total lack of realism with the game. There is no way that a race of beings that are all vying for control of a small section of land are just going to co-exist peacefully. It doesn't happen in nature and makes for a bland game. In the game I got blocked in and what was my recourse? Nothing. I am much more interested in something like Scythe where combat happens but is rare or some mechanism for rewarding the dominate player in a tight area of the map.

This game has a lot of moving parts... many interlocking mechanics. Becoming proficient at it will definitely take some time--and since there are 14 separate factions, I predict very good replayability.

That being said, I don't think Terra Mystica quite lives up to the hype. Very good game, but not quite the mind-blowing experience many of the comments would lead you to believe. I like it a lot, but I don't love it... at least not quite yet.

Terra Mystica is, hands down, the best board game I've ever played.  Every time I finish playing,(which is quite often) I have a strong urge to start another game.  I can't say that this is true for many other games.  The first game will take a LONG time, due to all the little rules you need to memorize, but after your 2nd or 3rd play you will have a strong understanding of everything.  That's when the fun really starts.  14 factions, and they all play differently.  I really enjoy playing a new character at random every game to keep it feeling fresh.  Each has its own exploits to discover and use to your advantage.  The power bowls system adds a new dynamic to the standard resource management, allowing you to throw away power for good, just to cash some in immediately.  This is a game for those who know how to take advantage of opportunity, as everything is face up, and there is little to no luck involved.  Came across this game after playing a lot of Cities and Knights for Catan.  Haven't played that one since.  The big heavy box of components is worth every penny.  Buy it.

A good game, but a completely over-rated one. Not particularly point-salad, but definitely mechanic-salad. A very dry, flavorless salad at that. I really like Euro games, and I don't mind dry as long as there are interesting mechanics and strategies to explore, but this one doesn't have any innovative mechanics of its own that I fell in love with, nor does it seamlessly put together the other mechanics that it's borrowed from other games.

2-5

Set-up 

1. Elke speler kiest een ras en neemt het bijhorende spelersbord en alle tokens in die kleur (priesters, gebouwen, markers en bruggen). Leg de priesters en bruggen opzij. 
2. Plaats de gebouwen op de overeenkomstige plaatsen op je eigen spelersbord. De meest linkse plaats op het huisjesspoor moet vrij blijven.  
3. Plaats een marker op de “0” van het schip-spoor, op de “3” van het spade-spoor en op de “20” op het overwinningspuntenspoor. 
4. Plaats de overige markers op de plaatsen “0” van elk cultuurspoor.  
5. Verdeel 12 krachttokens over bal 1 en bal 2 zoals aangeduid op het spelersbord. 
6. Neem het aantal werkers en munten zoals aangegeven op je spelersbord. 
7. Plaats de actietokens naast de 6 krachtactievelden op het algemeen speelbord. 
8. Neem 6 willekeurige scoretegels en plaats ze aan de linkerkant van het algemeen speelbord. Bedek de meest rechtse bonus van de hoogste tegel met het einde-van-het-spel-token. 
9. Leg alle gunsttegels (ovale tegels) in verschillende stapels volgens hun symbolen. 
10. Plaats willekeurig x-aantal bonustegels (lange verticale tegels). X = aantal spelers + 3. Doe de overige bonustegels in de doos. 
11. Te starten met de startspeler plaatst elke speler een huisje op het speelbord. De startspeler begint en dan gaat het verder in wijzerzin. Nadat iedereen een huisje heeft geplaatst, wordt er in tegenwijzerzin (te starten met de laatste speler) een tweede huisje geplaatst. 
12. Te starten met de laatste speler en tegenwijzerzin neemt elke speler een bonustegel. Leg een munt op de 3 niet-gekozen bonustegels. 

Overzicht van een beurt 

FASE 1: INKOMEN 
Elke speler neemt de grondstoffen waarbij een inkomen symbool staat  (een open hand). Als gebouwen worden verwijderd, komen er steeds meer symbolen zichtbaar. Neem zoveel grondstoffen als weergegeven op de track op je eigen spelersbord: werkers (witte blokjes) van huisjes, munten van handelshuizen, priesters van tempels of heiligdommen, kracht van hansdelshuizen en burchten. Daarnaast krijg je ook het inkomen van alle bonustegels (verticale tegels) en gunsttegels (ovale tegels) in je bezit. 

FASE 2: ACTIES 
Te beginnen met de startspeler en dan in wijzerzin doet elke speler een actie of past hij. Een speler die eenmaal heeft gepast, mag die ronde geen acties meer doen. Zo gaat het verder tot alle spelers hebben gepast. 
 
FASE 3: CULTUURBONUS EN OPRUIMFASE 
1. De spelers krijgen de cultuurbonussen die aan de rechterkant van de scoretegels liggen (zie linkerkant van het speelbord). Elke verworven spade mag over verschillende plaatsen verdeeld worden, maar kan niet gespaard worden voor volgende ronden. 
2. Verwijder de actie tokens van de gebruikte plaatsen op het algemeen speelbord, het eigen speelbord, de gunsttegels en de bonustegels. 
3. Plaats een munt op elke overgebleven bonustegel (verticale tegels). 
4. Draai de scoretegel van deze ronde om. 
Start daarna met fase 1 van een nieuwe ronde. 
Acties 

ACTIE 1: TRANSFORMEREN EN BOUWEN 
Transformeren: een terreintegel mag getransformeerd worden als de plaats vrij is en als de terreintegel direct of indirect aangrenzend is met één van je gebouwen. Elke stap om terrein te transformeren kost 1 spade. Je kan hiervoor gebruikmaken van je eigen spelersbord. Wanneer dit is gebeurd, plaats je een terreintegel van het nieuwe type op de huidige terreintegel. Als je terreintegel is getransformeerd naar je huisterreintegel, dan mag je onmiddellijk een huisje bouwen op die terreintegel, zonder dat dit een actie kost. Als krachtacties of bonussen je toelaten om twee plaatsen te transformeren, dan mag je enkel op de eerste tegel een gratis huisje plaatsen.  

Bouwen van een huisje: huisjes mogen enkel gebouwd worden op huisterreintegels en als de terreintegel direct of indirect aangrenzend is aan één van je gebouwen. De kost om te bouwen is weergegeven aan de linkerkant van het huisjesspoor. Neem het meest linkse huisje en plaats dit op de terreintegel. Huisjes mogen ook gebouwd worden zonder dat je eerst het terrein hebt getransformeerd. Per actie mag je slechts 1 huisje bouwen. Wanneer je direct aangrenzend bouwt aan een andere speler, heeft die andere speler de mogelijkheid om kracht te winnen.  

ACTIE 2: VOORUITGAAN OP HET SCHEEPSSPOOR 
Betaal de kost aan de linkerkant van het scheepsspoor om je marker één vakje te laten opschuiven. Je krijgt meteen het aantal overwinningspunten die aangegeven staan op het nieuwe vakje. Tegels die gescheiden zijn door een aantal riviertegels gelijk aan het nummer op het scheepsspoor, zijn indirect verbonden. 

ACTIE 3: VOORUITGAAN OP HET SPADESPOOR 
Betaal de kost onderaan het spadespoor om je marker één plaats op te schuiven. Je krijgt meteen het aantal overwinningspunten die aangegeven staan op het nieuwe vakje. Elke spade kost voor deze speler nu het aantal afgebeelde werkers. 

ACTIE 4: GEBOUWEN OPWAARDEREN 
Betaal de kost van het nieuwe gebouw (zie linkerkant van je eigen spelersbord). Plaats dit gebouw op het spelersbord en plaats het vroegere gebouw terug op je eigen spelersbord. Wanneer je direct aangrenzend aan een andere speler één van je gebouwen upgradet, heeft die andere speler de mogelijkheid om kracht te winnen.  
Handelshuis: upgrade van een huisje. Betaal de laagste kost als het huisje direct aangrenzend aan een andere speler wordt geplaatst. In het andere geval betaal je de hoogste kost. Burcht: upgrade van een handelshuis. De speler krijgt nu de speciale eigenschap die onder de burcht zit. Tempel: upgrade van een handelshuis. Neem meteen een gunsttegel (ovale tegel). Deze tegel moet verschillend zijn van de tegels die deze speler al bezit. Heiligdom: upgrade van een tempel. Neem meteen een gunsttegel (ovale tegel). Deze tegel moet verschillend zijn van de tegels die deze speler al bezit. 

ACTIE 5: PRIESTER NAAR EEN CULTUURSPOOR STUREN 
Plaats je priester op 1 van de open plaatsen onderaan het cultuurspoor. Beweeg daarna je marker het corresponderende aantal vakjes omhoog. De priester blijft daar staan gedurende de rest van het spel. OF: Gebruik de priester om slechts 1 vakje omhoog te gaan op het cultuurspoor. Daarna mag je de priester terug in je voorraad nemen. Opgelet: niet als een grondstof, je moet de priester opnieuw aanwerven! Als de marker langs kracht iconen gaat, dan krijg je het aangegeven aantal kracht. Slechts 1 marker kan de “10” bereiken op het cultuurspoor. De speler moet 1 stad hebben voor elke bezette “10”. 

ACTIE 6: KRACHTACTIES 
Geef kracht uit om krachtacties te gebruiken onderaan het algemeen speelbord. Plaats een actie token op de gekozen actie. Deze krachtactie kan deze ronde niet meer worden gekozen. 

ACTIE 7: SPECIALE ACTIES 
Gebruik de speciale acties aangeduid op je eigen spelersbord (onder een burcht), bonustegel (lange verticale tegel) of gunsttegel (ovale  tegel). Aangeduid met de oranje achthoekige achtergrond. Bedek deze actie met een actie token. Deze actie kan deze ronde niet meer worden gekozen. 

ACTIE 8: PASSEN 
Een speler die heeft gepast, komt deze ronde niet meer aan de beurt. Je krijgt eventuele inkomsten op je bonustegel omdat je hebt gepast. Dit herken  je aan de dichtgevouwen perkamentrol. Leg nu je bonustegel (verticale tegel) terug  in de voorraad en neem een nieuwe bonustegel (die je omgedraaid voor jou legt). De eerste speler die past is de nieuwe startspeler in de volgende ronde. 

Einde van het spel 

Het spel eindigt na 6 ronden. Na de 6e ronde scoor je geen bonussen meer (dit was afgedekt).  

PUNTENTELLING 
1. Voor elk cultuurspoor: 
a. de hoogste speler : 8 overwinningspunten 
b. de tweede hoogste speler: 4 overwinningspunten 
c. de derde hoogste speler: 2 overwinningspunten 
  
2. Score voor een gebied. Een gebied bestaat uit alle gebouwen van een speler die direct of indirect zijn verbonden. 
a. De speler met het grootste gebied: 18 overwinningspunten 
b. De speler met het tweede grootste gebied: 12 overwinningspunten 
c. De speler met het derde grootste gebied: 6 overwinningspunten 

3. Zet alle overgebleven grondstoffen om in munten. 1 overwinningspunt per 3 munten. 
Bij ex aequo deel je de punten door 2 (afgerond naar beneden). 

Belangrijke regels 

AANGRENZEND 
Direct aangrenzend: gebouwen grenzen fysiek aan een ander eigen gebouw 
Indirect aangrenzend: er zitten riviertegels tussen de gebouwen. Het aantal riviertegels is minstens even groot als de waarde van de speler op zijn scheepsspoor. 

KRACHT VERDIENEN EN UITGEVEN 
Elke keer als een speler kracht verdient, moet dit verdiend worden in deze volgorde: 
1. Verplaats de krachtfiches van bal 1 naar bal 2 (indien mogelijk). 
2. Als bal 1 leeg is, verplaats dan het overgebleven aantal krachtfiches van bal 2 naar bal 3. 
3. Als bal 2 ook leeg is, kan er geen extra kracht meer worden verdiend. 
Krachtfiches kunnen ook meteen van bal 2 naar bal 3 verplaatst worden (zelfs al is bal 1 leeg). In dat geval moet je één krachtfiche uit het spel verwijderen voor elke krachtfiche die je van bal 2 naar bal 3 verplaatst. Dit heeft prioriteit op de krachtactie.  
Kracht kan uitgegeven worden door krachtfiches van bal 3 naar bal 1 te verplaatsen. 

CONVERSIES 
Op elk moment tijdens het spel kan een speler kracht omzetten in grondstoffen. Daarnaast mag hij ook grondstoffen omzetten in andere grondstoffen.
 
BRUGGEN 
Bruggen moet gebouwd worden over rivieren. De brug moet minstens 1 terreintegel raken waarop een gebouw van deze speler  staat. Twee gebouwen die verbonden zijn door een brug, zijn nu direct aangrenzend. 
 
STEDEN 
Een speler heeft een stad als hij een gebied heeft van minstens 4 direct aangrenzende gebouwen en een gecombineerde krachtwaarde van minstens 7. Als een speler een stad heeft gebouwd, neemt hij de stadstegel. Dankzij de stadstegel krijgt hij EENMALIG de overwinningspunten (bovenaan de stadstegel) en EENMALIG het voordeel (onderaan de tegel).

First impressions quite positive after my first play. Essentially a much more advanced [i]Settlers of Catan[/i] combined with action selection mechanics, advanced types of buildings, special racial abilities and variable victory points. The interaction of the different mechanics is interesting without that feeling of cleverness for the sake of cleverness that games like [i]Trajan[/i] leave me with.

This is definitely a brain burner, probably on par with [i]Dominant Species[/i] in terms of difficulty.

Update: Eh, after a few more plays, I got a distinct "been there, done that". Another euro that just didn't hold up to very many repeated plays.

[2013-05-06 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]

When I played Terry Mystica (TM) for the first time, I expected a more civilization like game, which Terra Mystica really isn't. Instead, I would compare it to Kingdom Builder, albeit TM is clearly the heavier game. The whole point of the game is to make the most victory points possible by using your race's special abilities and timing your moves so that you get as much victory points from the round bonus tiles as possible. 

The theme doesn't really matter, it's all about finding the optimal chain of actions to maximize your victory point income. Since all bonus tiles are known from the start, you can enter the game with a clear strategy in mind and choose the race that you consider to be the most beneficial. It's not about choosing the race that you like the most, it's about identifying the race that will yield the most points under the given circumstances.

As a Eurogamer, I do like this kind of challenge and I want to explore Terra Mystica further. But I'm afraid that my Ameritrash loving gaming buddies might not want to join me on this journey after their first game.

2 plays, both with 3 players. Lost some interest in this game after the 2nd play. Don't feel like playing this again for a while.

Some points listed below:
Components look nice. The game is visually fantastic, imo.
Theme feels nearly non-existent for me.
Setting this game up frustrates me.

I've been thinking about why I enjoy Power Grid more than this and I suspect it's because I 'feel' like there's sufficient 'interaction' (due to the auctioning of power plants) in Power Grid but not in Terra Mystica. There'd be more interaction with 4-5 players but I'm quite confident that the degree of 'interaction' would still be insufficient for me to enjoy Terra Mystica. For comparison, Puerto Rico has sufficient 'interaction' for me and I enjoy Puerto Rico but it feels like Dominion has even less 'interaction' than Terra Mystica yet I still enjoy Dominion. Maybe it's the combination of long game duration, low 'interaction', and the race mechanic (i.e. I'm usually not a fan of games in which one has to pick a race and/or class) that makes me not like this game.

I really love this game because it is deep and thinky, interactive without being directly confrontational, and packs this all in a reasonable play time. Almost bewildering set of options, but it's most impressive how it all hangs together. There's actually a nice logic to the game. Thoroughly enjoy this one and can't wait to play it again. This may be the Ultimate Euro Game.

RATING: 6
Despite a dizzying array of possibilities apparently there's only one way to play some of the races, so forget about exploring options. This and Kingdom Builder both have maps that completely fail to evoke any sense of place. Stark example of a designer's failure to understand that art is not theme.

Edit: After several more plays my first impressions, while still valid, don't make it as bad as it seemed. The races are massively imbalanced, but experienced players have ways of compensating for that - I guess by bidding vp's for races based on their knowledge of the inter-relationships and the round bonus tiles.

That said, there are so many better euros. I don't really understand why this one strikes a chord with so many people, but it is a solid game despite the flaws.

Believe the hype.  You are constantly making important, interesting decisions.   Add to that, every game will be totally different based on the race combinations, and you are pretty much guaranteed a great gaming experience every time you play.   The learning curve also goes down with each play.  Amazing game.

I absolutely love that there are so many factions available in the game, though I do worry a bit that each is going to have pretty much one way to play it.  This is the same problem I had with Sentinels of the Multiverse.  The game itself is ok, and the only reason I haven't bumped this up to a higher rating is that I'm not sold on that aspect.

Giving this a tentative "generic euro what I like" rating of 8/10. This may creep up as a few of my favourites have with more plays, and I suspect it will if I get it played with more than 2. I've only played once with more than 2 so far and I think it would get much more interesting the more crowded the board is. I love how much asymmetry there is here though.

I had heard a lot of hype on BGG about how great this was.  At least for me, I learned a lesson about ignoring the hype.  It's not a really bad game, but there's just too much going on for me.  Too "fiddley", to many decisions to make, too "busy" - I don't know how to put it.  Plus, none of the decisions made sense in a game way - not intuitive at all.  I just couldn't follow what was going on very well.  It overwhelmed me, and not in a good way.   My best friend feels the same way.  He came in 2nd place the one time we played, and he didn't understand how he did it. I don't think I'll ever play it again.  OK, maybe if I was on a desert island and the game washed up on shore...  Nah, I'd use it to start a fire!  Not a lot of fun.

I've only played once, so my rating of 5 is only temporary.  I played the Chaos Magicians, and I felt seriously handicapped by the race.  Enough so that the first half of the game really wasn't fun for me.  Perhaps if you place your 1 house (everyone else gets 2) in the perfect place, and if you do the right move on the first turn, then the race is balanced.  But if you just learned the game, then you're in for an unpleasant game play experience for a short while.

I have a collection of about 30 games, and Terra Mystica is easily my favorite game. It's the perfect game for people that love strategy board games that involve 0 luck and 100% strategy. This makes victories feel completely yours and losses feel that much worse. Often times one or two different moves in the early stages could have set you up differently in the later rounds and these mistakes often cost you the game. Some people may not like such a high risk factor with every move, but that's what makes every victory in Terra Mystica feel even better, knowing you outplayed everyone and earned your victory. Rules may seem dense at first, but Rahdo does a great job breaking them down. Completely worth the 2 hr investment to get the rules down. Expansion only adds more and balances things out with race auction.

Great game that reminds me somewhat of Eclipse in how well it all fits together.

Lots of stuff to do, both long time and short time planning needed and not that much downtime even with five players as you only take one action each at a time. A little bit of angst too when it comes to in what order you should do your actions, as someone else can block you or take the power action you really need.

I really liked it, but would probably prefer it with four players instead of five to get the playtime down a bit. Rating likely to go up with more plays.

The only problem I have with the game is the downtime when it comes to the cult track the last turns. Will perhaps be less of a problem with more games.

Update: Played a couple of three player games and think that four players is probably the sweet spot despite being a great three and five player game as well.

Probably the best new euro I've played this year (2013).  A mix of a lot of different games but well implemented.  Time will tell if some of the races are imbalanced.  I'm thinking about picking this one up when it becomes available again.  Downside is game and explanation length.  I think it is a good 2 hour game, but our first game went close to 4 hours with a 1 hour explanation.  If time can be brought down, it will hit the table often.  Otherwise it won't see as much play as it gets relegated to a weekend game and has to compete against the better/longer games.

After 7 games playing half the races, I think I need to bump this up to 9.  I always seem to want to play it.

One of the best games released ever. In-depth strategy game but intuitive to teach. This is I must by for any serious gamer. It makes you want to come back right away and play again.

Players attempt to expand the territory of their fantasy race, by constructing buildings and scoring victory points.  Meaty, busy game of resource accumulation and management.  Players earn income of workers, cash, priests and power, and use these resources while taking actions to expand their on board position.  The key concept is building and upgrading buildings, which can only exist on that race's key terrain.  Terrain can be terraformed into the race's key terrain just prior to construction, consuming precious resources.  Players can also spend power from their "battery" (a 3 cup system of moving power tokens around, allowing the battery to recharge), which are powerful, limited bonus actions.  The game is about accruing victory points, and there are many ways to achieve this, so it all needs to be carefully managed.  Quite a straightforward game to play, once you get the rules down, and with fourteen difference races to play (each with different abilities and quirks), means you have an endlessly re-playable game.  Quite stunning, luck free, tactical .... possibly the best game from Essen 2012.

A few months later and this game is in my top 10 - and that rarely changes.  Stunningly good - best game of the 2010's so far.

Very interesting economic engine game hidden under a bland fantasy theme. The idea of terraforming to be able to build on the map, the interplay between the different currencies (workers, priests, money and mana), the diversity of ways of obtaining victory points (building specific buildings during different phases, getting bonuses at the end of a turn depending on role chosen, largest area at the end of game and highest in four different tracks) make for a game with a good amount of depth and relatively fast playing time.
It's a shame that the box cover does nothing to convey this and that the theme is a bland fantasy theme.

I've only played twice but that's enough to know that this isn't the game for me. I have several problems with the game:
- it's overly long. Both time I've played, I've been ready to pack it up at about the midway point
- Everything you do gives you points and none of the actions seem to pay off immediately. When playing I can't really determine the value of performing one action over the other and as a result, I feel like I'm just doing random things hoping they work out.
- The game design seems clunky - everything including the kitchen sink is in there.

Variable player powers work really well in ameritrash games that are more free-form, but it is very hard for euros, with their tighter mechanisms, to pull these off.  Terra Mystica is a euro that manages to accomplish use of special player powers and yet keeps the game well balanced.  

The underlying game is a solid, if only moderately inspired, euro design, kept fresh by the random setup of scoring and bonus tiles.  The 3 currency system is well done, particularly power, which runs in a very interesting feast/famine cycle. 

It is impressive that a euro of this weight can even accommodate special player powers without breaking.  I think the trade-off for this is that the underlying system is rather simplistic, as it likely has to be to accommodate the layering of special powers on top.  This type of setup works great for a game like Cosmic Encounter or Small World because the excitement comes from the interaction between all the special powers.  There is not nearly as much interaction in Terra Mystica, so there is much less to discover as far as interplay between the various powers.  That leaves you with using your power to optimize how well you turn the crank on the underlying point-generation systems.  Eurogames rely upon having interesting mechanisms, so I don't know how this game will fare in the long run given that its skeleton is fairly dull compared to the truly great, enduring euros.

In order to do well in TM, I think you need to leverage your race power to maximum potential, and it may be that over time this will lead to somewhat scripted play.  To be sure, each character will have its own script to learn, but it may be a script none the less.  I don't get the sense that the interaction between player powers is strong, so I don't think there is a lot to explore as far as certain power matchups.  Time will tell!

I think my favorite thing about the game is that there is so often a clever way to squeeze in one more action.  It is as though you are constantly finding a forgotten $20 in your back pocket.  

I hope to get better at this game, because it gives me brain freeze like little else I've played recently.  I hate to be that guy who takes 5 minutes to do his turn, but it is hard to resist the urge to think everything through carefully, as the profits of doing so can be very great.

UPDATE July 2013:
I am even more convinced that the essential element for successful play is to use your racial power to its maximum potential.  This isn't like Agricola where you can get along without your cards, using them to boost you where appropriate.  In the absence of your racial power, development is very slow, and you will be quickly left behind.  The issue with this is that you need to play each race in a very specific way.  There is some  fun to be had in discovering this best way, but I am finding the game is losing its shine as the included races are "played out."  

I think this game has a lot of "curb appeal", but as I dug into it I found that the underlying mechanisms aren't all that interesting despite all the brain burn they require to execute.  The racial powers are the secret sauce here, but rather than adding interesting interactions, they just dictate how you need to play.  I doubt that this game will remain in the Top 10 on the 'Geek for long as it gets wider distribution and people accumulate plays.  

Where I have ended up on TM is that it I think it has a lot of fancy feathers, but not much tasty meat underneath.

The game undoubtedly has a lot of time and love put into it, and it shows, but it also feels chaotic, as if you are being pulled in many directions at once.  Elements of Kingdom Builder + Catan + Tzolk'in style religion track + racial benefits to improve replay value and variety?  Overall, a very fun game.  A little better with 3+ players, but 2 is still great fun.

I like:
- Encourages player interaction through rewards for proximity building and blocking of moves / rewards / board space.
- Very strategic.  Lots of paths to victory.  Main randomness element is from other players: no dice rolling or card draws.
- Racial differences give direction to a wide field of actions, enhance replayability.

Not so much:
- Poor initial choices or recognition of a race's strengths could lead to misery later on.
- Feels like your race grows exponentially; actions feel overly expensive until the last few rounds, then a sudden surge in options.  Probably related to first dislike.

I originally gave this game a 10, but after some long thought: [-]the player interaction is limited to the Cultist track and the map-blocking[/-]; and I firmly believe that *every* game should have one (very) tiny random element in it (so that a losing player has some hope), and this game does not. This game was *the* hit of Geekway to the West 2013.

UPDATE: Well, I was wrong. There is also player interaction in the race selection, and the player turn order (though I think the player order is more an effect than a conscious design - I'm sure I'll prefer the player-order by passing-order variant from the upcoming expansion).

My nine-year-old son said, "I like this game". That's GOLD: he's never liked a (non-cooperative) gamer's game before. Ever.

Felt unnecessarily complex at first, but after a round or two, everything becomes clear.   You kind of have to relish in the game's many moving parts, or it won't be enjoyable.   I was reminded of Hansa Teutonica, in that each player has a number of pieces on their individual board that they are trying to get onto the main map (i.e. it is a "dashboard" game).  A variety of wood bits represent the different building types, which functions essentially as a tech tree.   The catch is that you can only build on your own color, so you must "terraform" a hex to match your color first.   The game aims to have theme by providing 14 different fantasy races to play, each with different costs or special abilities, but I'd say the theme is almost non-existent apart from a few nods in the racial abilities.   It has as much theme as Kingdom Builder, for example.   The only part of the game that felt a little flat to me mechanically was the 4 color tracks that players are racing to be first in.   This has been done in many other games and didn't add much here.   But, by and large, for a heavier, thinky-er Euro, this is an engaging and interesting game throughout its length.   Has gotten better with age.

TM is one of the few games that gets better with more players; it shines with 4 or 5. With 14 possible player factions to choose from, it offers a lot of variety to explore. With the round bonuses randomly changing, each game requires strategic adjustments to maximize your score. There is a lot going on, so teaching this game to new players requires patience from both the teacher and the learners. But it is worth it; the game is great fun. TM is an excellent way to spend 2-3 hours when you are ready for games with more depth than Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride or Stone Age.

I think this game is among the most overrated games in the BGG. There are apparently many options but having your race and the VP tiles set, your optimal path is almost decided, with little tough decisions.

RATING: 10
I can't imagine not having this game in my library.  The balance between wanting/needing to build close to other players (for cheaper upgrades and for leeching power) while also being able to expand your territory is at the heart of what makes this a great game.  The race to secure those coveted and contested hexes in the early game is stressful and exciting.  Maximizing VPs by building and upgrading during the optimal round takes patience and commitment to your long term strategy.  The final push to score those last few VPs, win a cult track or two, and hopefully connect your last couple dwellings to compete for the largest area bonus is where all your hard work over the previous couple hours can finally pay off.  Can you wait one more turn to grab that power action that gives you the 7 coins you need, or should you burn power to grab it because Bob is looking like he might grab it before it comes back to you?  Do you need to pass early to get the bonus card that gives you a free spade, or would it be better to upgrade another temple (with that sweet, sweet favor tile and priest income) and risk someone else passing before you and grabbing it?

The box seems to weigh as much as a small car for a reason--the individual player pieces are wood and the game board and player mats are thick cardboard.  If the game play wasn't as good as it is, you might still want to pull it out just for the feel of the pieces.

It is highly replayable.  The asymmetric races each have their own unique attributes and powers, and it's fun to see how differently you have to play with each of them in order to succeed.  Combining all the different races with the variability of round scoring tiles and bonus cards means that no two games will be the same.  With different scoring tiles and bonus cards in the game, you might need to employ different strategies from one game to the next even if playing with the same race.

The fact that everything is available for you to see from the very beginning of the game (players can't hide their available resources and there are no random events that happen) means you can plan your strategy out from beginning to end (or at least a couple rounds in advance).  This gives more experienced players a distinct advantage; however, there's no opportunity to mess with your opponents directly.  There is competition for real estate and power actions, but you don't have to worry about someone attacking you which is nice and will allow newer players the freedom to figure things out without being annihilated to the point where they just can't do anything.

The artwork is attractive and interesting, and the fact that there are no words on the game board or player mats is very much appreciated.  Everything is handled with iconography.  So once you understand what the icons mean, even new players will rarely need to consult the rule book.

This is a HEAVY game (literally and figuratively), but it is incredible.  The only problem I have is finding people to play it with me since it takes a long time to explain the instructions, and it takes someone one or two playthroughs before they are comfortable with it.  It's also much better with 3-5 players than it is a 2-player game.  Though there are some interesting 2-player variant suggestions out there on the forums.  Fortunately, there's a mobile version of it so I can get my fix.

RATING: 7.4
The first time I played this, I was completely confused.  Ok, I'm building all of these things on the board, trying to expand and get more resources.  But that stuff isn't worth points on its own?  I'm trying to grab up all this territory to build on, but at the same time I want to be butting up against the other players?  I can build my big building to unlock new powers, or I can build temples to get persistent bonuses, or I can advance my tech so it's easier to do stuff, or just put lots of small buildings down?  And then there's the cult board to worry about?!  And the magic system!  And the variable player powers!  

This game is similar to some others, and feels a little familiar, but it's also very different.  Playing it is easy.  Playing well, playing to win..  now that's tough.

My only big complaint about the game is the map: it never changes.  There's no cordoning off areas in a game with fewer players.  There's no modularity to it.  I think I'd get tired of the [i]board[/i] long before I got tired of any of the other aspects, which have good variety to them.

I'm still at that point where I haven't played with all the races yet, and certainly haven't tried them all multiple times, so it's still fresh for me.  It was getting tons of play for a while, and still gets played frequently, but not at quite the frenetic pace when it was new.  Not one I feel like doing all the time, but still quite good.

ed. So, after quite a few more games and some discussion, I've become more frustrated with some of the game's rough edges.  The races just aren't balanced completely.  Most of them are close, but there are a couple standouts and a couple that are clearly weaker.  What I'd really like is a single document with errata that patches them up a little, as a result of all the play the game's been getting.  Maybe give the giants an extra worker to start, or take away a couple points from some other faction, or shift a token or two from bowl 2 back to bowl 1.  Minor tweaks to bring them in line.  I don't have the time or inclination to generate such a guide, but there are one or two online.  It is a thorny issue, for certain.  Figuring out exactly which factions are strongest/weakest and by how much is no easy task.  I do feel that it's necessary, however, for players to go into a game with confidence that they have an equal shot, and that their victory won't be because their faction is OP.

RATING: 8.5
Very good game, but does not tickle the fun factor as much as I'd like.

This was a day 1 buy for me as it ticked all the boxes I love, Euro resource engine/management, long term strategy, short term tactics, many factions, simple mechanics, area control, top-notch components... Drooled over it.

Could not have fallen flatter with our first 4p game.  It just felt lifeless and abstract.  The kicker was we consistently missed actions and messed up rules constantly, skipped some scoring, and many just played very poorly.  Most of my family group were not too excited to play again but remained intrigued at least.  

Games #2-3 were still just ok but could tell understanding was starting to click and scores were improving and fewer mistakes and rule misses were being made as our brains wrapped around all the different factors to building your engine, board presence, and final score.

Game #4 everything just started to click.  Great experience.  Tons of tough choices, very little luck, simple to understand resource engine, and everyone understood what each was going for to a small extent.

There are quite a few moving pieces here that just overwhelmed us at first and prevent us from bringing out more often:  Favor, Towns, Bonus tiles, Cult Track, Power, Stronghold Powers, Faction abilities, Round Bonuses, and Resources.  Most of us being seasoned mid-heavy gamers, it felt like a juggling act until 4-5 plays in.

RATING: 7
This is a complex game with lots of mechanisms and exceptions to learn.

Now that I've internalized the complexity, most of the fun is in solving the private puzzles of acquiring bonuses and converting resources. Both puzzles reward long-term strategy.

A smaller part of the fun is interacting with other players on the shared map, power action spaces, and temple tracks.

It took a few plays to understand how to choose a faction and place well at the beginning. If you choose and place poorly it can be hard to catch up.

I enjoy this game in spite of its weaknesses: too much complexity, too much importance on early-game decisions, too steep of a learning curve, too little interaction.

After 2 plays: I wanted to wait for a rating after I was left a little unsure about the game following my first play. After my second play, I see the "hype" about this game. Plenty of levers to pull to try to squeeze out efficiency in this game. The different factions seem to really play differently, and in subtle yet interesting ways. I'm to the point where I dont think I'd ever turn down a game of this, but would have a hard time convincing myself and my wife to buy it as there is a bit of a learning barrier...as proven to me by my first play. Great game, at least worth a (2) tries.

Great Game! I will admit this game is deep and has a lot going on. But once you start to get the knack for how things interact it becomes really fun to try and outwit your opponents of the actions that you can do and how you can get your great race to be played to its fullest extent.

Game tuned to my taste. Perfect mechanics, perfect game length, perfect complexity, huge replay value.
Great middle to heavy weight euro brain burner placed in fantasy setting where 14 (20 with expansion) different factions build their empires on different types of terrain through terraformation.
Every player has his own type of terrain on which he can build and they are also competing for the favor of gods in 4 cults: Fire, Water, Earth and, who would know it, Air. It is fairly complex, but perfectly designed, fluent and elegant. The components are beautiful, artwork is quite appealing and different factions are so perfectly balanced with many paths to victory.

People mostly criticise the lack of player interaction. For me, there is pretty enough of it. Although there are no any direct conflicts, we were constantly competing to in a race for different objectives and goals. Also the mechanic where it is much cheaper to expand your city next to other players while it also gives them power points to use their magic is fantastic. The game is just awesome!

[b]Update:[/b] Rating modified according to a custom rating system.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] The way income on the player board is covered by buildings and different buildings cover different income. If you build a dwelling you will get income of workers. But if you upgrade a dwelling to a trading post you will uncover income of power and gold but you will have to return the dwelling to the player board, once again covering the income of workers.

Nem véletlen tarolt tavaly minden nagyobb díjon: jól el van találva, változatos. És bár sokfelé figyelős, meg minden, azért valahol nem is olyan bonyolult, és meg van benne a másikkal szembeni konfrontáció lehetősége is. Nagyon bejött. Az értékelés egy játék után, ha többet játszom vele, akár még nőhet is. 
A játék:
6 forduló, minden fordulót egy lapka jelez, aminek az egyik felén a forduló közben szerezhető plusz pontokat mutatja (azaz h miért jár), a másik felén meg a forduló végén kapható bónuszokat. (vagyis h miért járhat mi).
A játék, világjáték: vagyis egy világon vagyunk, ahol sok csoport-törzs-nép él, (nem egyértelmű, mert a törpe nyilván nép, de a fakírok nem annyira :-), a szabályban csoport van). Az adott játékra annyi nép lesz,ahányan játszunk, amúgy is csak 7 féle lehet, mert a játékoslapok 2 oldalúak, mindkét felén 1-1- csoport, így egyik választása kizárja a másikat. Már csak azért is, mert azok azonos színűek. A színek egyben megfelelnek a földrészen látható tereptípusnak is, így az egyes csoportok otthonföldje, a saját színe: ilyen helyre tudnak építkezni, a másik típusúakat előtte terraformálniuk kell a hazai földtípusra. Az egyes csoportok nem egyformák, a csoportnak megfelelően vmi pluszt tudnak, vmi mást tudnak, mint a többiek, egyediek. 8 féle akció van amikből egyesével lehet választani a fordulókban és egy forduló addig tart, amíg mindenki nem passzol. A 8 akció, a terraformálás és építkezés, az épület fejlesztése (egymásra épülnek, ha az alap épületet tovább fejlesztjük, az visszakerül. Illetve a felépített épületek miatt kapunk a köv forduló elején bevételt (amit a  játékostáblán a feltett épület helyén van ábrázolva)). Hajózás fejlesztése  (messzebb is tudunk építkezni), ásó cserearány javítása -olcsóbban tudunk terraformálni-, pa küldése vmelyik kultuszba (4 féle van, a játék végén az egyes kultuszukban értékelés, h ki milyen magasra jutott, igen sok pont járhat érte, plusz menetközben így-itt is lehet hatalomponthoz jutni), aztán vannak a spec akciók is, ezek egy fordulóban 1x hajhatók végre, van amiért "harc" folyik, azaz aki kapja, marja: ezek a játéktáblán vannak, és hatalompontért szerezhetőek meg, hajthatók végre. Van amit adott játékos tud megcsinálni a csoportja miatt, van ami a bónuszkártyákhoz kapcsolódik, van ami a kegytárgyakhoz.
A játékban a fix körösség miatt egyértelműen látható vég. A terraformálás-építkezés nagyon jól van kitalálva, a hatalompontok rendszere szintén (3 hatalomtartály, egyikből a másikba lehet csorgatni a hatalmat, és a 3. tárolóból tudja a játékos felhasználni, ami újra az elsőbe kerül vissza). Ez egyrészt ugye a spec akciókhoz, másrészt papra, emberre vagy pénzre is konvertálható. Az építkezéseknél 2 jó ötlet: egyrészt ha van a szomszédban más csoportnak épülete, akkor ő kaphat hatalompontot azért, hogy mellette épít vki - igaz nem ingyen, és függ az épületének nagyságától. A másik: h az egybefüggő épületsorok várossá válthatók bizonyos feltételek esetén, amiért persze bónusz és pont jár. A menetközben szerzett pontokhoz (egyes fordulók spec pontjai, aztán az akciókkal szerezhetők, aztán bónuslapokkal szerezhetők stb) mellé a játék végén 2 dologért pont: az említett 4 kultusz kiértékelése -ki van benne előrébb- és a legnagyobb összefüggő saját területért is jár pont. 
Nagyon jó, ötletes, jól felépített, interaktív, de magadban is tervezős, jó a mechanikára öntött téma, szóval kiváló.

After seven plays in a week's time, this game has shot to the top of m favorites list. I have never obsessed over playing and re-playing a game like I have this one. 

For those who are wondering what it's all about: it's a heavy euro, with engine building, resource management, and a tiny bit of worker placement. There's a heck of a lot to keep track of throughout the game (five separate resources to manage, plus plenty of cost/benefit analysis on the multiple different ways you can pick up VPs here and there), but the rules themselves are actually not that complex, and most people should have a firm grasp of the game halfway through their first playthrough.

Running time is pretty fast: with four players, we knocked out two games in 2.5 hours, including setup and teardown.

There is a bit of discussion on the Geek about balancing between the 14 different factions you can play, but so far, it all seems pretty balanced. Some are definitely harder to catch onto the strategy than others, but once you've gotten a race's strategy, no one seems noticeably over- or under-powered.

For anyone who loves Euros, this game should be at the absolute top of their buy list.

This is one of the only "thinky" games I recall having a really negative reaction to and disliking quite a bit. In retrospect, I played this game when I was just learning about board gaming and I know I really struggled with it, (even while playing with helpful and patient board gamers) I need to determine if I truly disliked Terra Mystica or if it was just too much for me when I was just being introduced to the hobby. This game needs another play, but under the precise circumstances of prepping by watching a video beforehand and being well-rested, caffeinated, and full of carbohydrates.

Incredibly deep game requiring players to balance an economic engine while attempting use the same resources to develop and grow their civilization. While deep, surprisingly easy to learn within a round or two.  Mechanics feel borrowed from other titles that experienced gamers will recognize.  The sheer variety of races out of the box (14) will keep you busy for a while.  The races feel a little unbalanced, but each have strengths and weaknesses AND each play very differently. Discover your own play style!

Strongly recommend to acquire the 4 Town Tiles promo via Feuerland's website or BGG.

The expansion Fire & Ice was released at Essen '14 and re-balances the original map to make some of the more challenging races more competitive.  Also, incorporates 6 new factions and two new terrain types.  Looking forward to many more hours of play!

Sprawling, brain-burning, AP fest, in a fantasy civ-building package. You want it? It's in here, which gives it a kitchen sink of Eurogames feel. Seems like every game mechanism is included. Feels like a mashup of Small World, Kingdom Builder, Castles of Burgundy, and Eclipse. Yet despite all the game does well, I'm not sure it's fun. A challenge, yes, but it's too much like work, and it lacks the narrative that a game this long needs to sustain itself. That said, I'd play it again, because it needs repeat plays to get the reward it promises.

One of my favorite games to date. The races while unbalanced give a nice difference to how each person will play. Hopefully the expansion will fix the race balance issues. I am teaching others the strategies on how to score in the 130-150 range which has made the game a lot more interesting. The end points make it so you know what you have to do to win on the last turn which makes turn 6 the longest, yet fun moments of the game.

Only one play... but looking back on it, this has some of my favorite mechanics. After setup, the game has no randomness, but the variable player powers and bonus tiles provide a lot of variability. I really like action selection games with passing incentives (e.g. turn order, bonus tiles) and the interaction on the main board is great. The cult track seems a bit bolted on, but overall, this could end up being my favorite Euro game.

Some things I love about it, mostly its complexity to awesomeness ratio. The complexity makes it awesome, which is cool, because usually lots of bits and things become blah.

Bad things. Its so unbalanced and everyone plays the same way with same races. Its a lot like Settlers where the beginning of the game determines the next 2 hours, which is stupid in my mind. Rather play Village, Carson City, Puerto Rico, at least in person.

Now online, Terra Mystica is a 10. Game against AI in 15 mins.

Best Essen release of 2012. Hooked on this game! Every play is different because of the different factions and bonus tile set up.

After having played all factions I still don't get tired of this game, I like it even better. Great competition and always a nice puzzle.

Terra Mystica is a euro with a strong spatial element. You have to manage the following resources: Workers, Money, Power and Priests. Money and workers are needed for building and upgrading buildings. Workers are also needed for terraforming neighboring land types to the type of land that your race is able to inhabit. You usually start the game with 2 of the most basic building (the Dwelling) on a hex board. The Dwelling gives you workers in an Eclipse sort of method such that when you remove something from your board to place on the main board you're uncovering additional income. These Dwellings can be upgraded into Trade Houses. The Trade Houses will give you money and power in the income phase. It's cheaper to build a Trade House if it's next to an opponents building. Though, if you build or upgrade any buildings next to an opponent, your opponent can buy power for a VP amount. The Trade House can be upgraded into one of two things. The first is the Stronghold which is one of your mega buildings. It usually gives you power for income and always unlocks a special ability based on the race you've chosen. The special ability could be a one-time effect, a constant ability, or a special action you can use once/turn. 

Trade Houses also have the option to upgrade into a Temple. Temples will give Priests for your income and also a Favor Tile. The favor tile will move you up a Cult Track of your choice and usually has a special ability. This could be income, scoring options, special abilities and special actions. Temples can be upgraded into a Sanctuary. The other mega building. Upgrading gives you a Favor Tile, typically a Priest for income and it makes it easier to create a town in your conglomerate. When conglomerates get so large, they will become towns which will give you points, a one-time benefit, and the ability to climb to the highest point in one cult track.

At the beginning of the game you can choose a special tile which usually will give you income of various types, and/or scoring opportunities, and/or special actions. Tiles that aren't chosen get money ala Puerto Rico. When a player passes at the end of the round they choose one of these special tiles to use in the next round gaining any money that may have accrued on them and then pass in their old one which other players can then choose from. So, what are Priests for? You can advance in the Cult Track with them. This can be done in a small increment or if you remove them from the game then it will be a larger increment. They can also help upgrade your workers to make terraforming land more efficient. Beyond that, you can use Priests to upgrade your naval capabilities. Naval capabilities will let you transform lands across water and make your network larger for the end game scoring. The alternative to naval capabilities is creating bridges which costs Power.

What's power good for? Power can get you immediate resources at a somewhat hefty cost that don't take an action. In addition to that, there are 6 power costing actions that all players have access to. That said, each actions can only be used once per round in a first come, first served basis. What's the point of the Cult Track? At the end of the game, each of the four cults have an area majority-eque scoring for whoever has climbed the highest on the cult track. Rising on the cult track is a minor method for gaining power. Finally at the end of a round players can possibly get a bonus based on how high they have climbed a particular cult based on the round tile. The higher they are the more they can benefit from this round tile. The round tiles also dictate what you will get bonus points for during that round. This is typically for putting a specific type of building on the board. Beyond the Cult scoring, the end game has a scoring for the largest network in an area majority sort of way. 

The game is alright. I like the various factions despite the fact that they don't seem completely balanced. I think my biggest problem with the game is the round tiles which give you points for doing something specific. I feel they dictate what you should be doing more than what I would like. I think it would have been better if building were worth decent VP and the bonus on these tiles were minor VP. Instead buildings are just a means to get resources and special abilities. Beyond that the round tiles also create incentives on which cult tracks you should be focusing on at various points of the game. I prefer more freedom in my games but this is a good game, with low luck and lots of replay value.

Amazing game.  Very heavy and complex but just well done.  Numerous factions that all play differently, simple mechanics (just a TON of them), and player interaction ensure tons of replayability and depth... but without randomness.  No dice rolling etc.  If you are looking for one of the better deeper games out there, then start here.

A lot of choices and at first play - I got very confused over everything (and even managed to lock myself out of building certain buildings due to using up all my pieces! - without expensive fort or temples being built in pre-existing cities!) but seemed fun and I'd like to try it again to see why it's so popular!

6 rounds doesn't feel like much - so you need to play again.

Terra Mysticas rating has dropped after every game. I´ve come to realize that it´s too long for me with 5 players, but doesn´t work with 2-3. 4 is probably the only I´ll play.

Another issue is the huge importance of starting positions. You can pretty much lose your game in the start with bad placement. And that sucks hard...

TRADED IT!

This one dropped from a 6 for me. At first it was a splashy new toy, but after slogging through the rules again to play it a year later, it wasn't worth the work. Felt there were just a few too many tacked on bits in the game to give it a "WoW" effect without adding anything necessary to gameplay.

In the end it is a solid game that is likely ranked higher than it ought to be from excess media buzz.

A game with endless opportunities, little interaction and more like an abstract bookkeeping thing. BUT while playing it started to become quite fascinating to all of us. Want to play it more often.

After several plays: It is an innovative good game - in any aspect BUT I don't like it because it is too complex for me, takes too long, is very dependend on the start setting one chooses - and I use to loose badly.

So, it is a great game - but not for me. I just play it from timt to tome to do my group a favour.

I was very positively surprised about this game, although I hadn't expected it to be bad even if I was quite suspicious about variable player powers involved. They seemed to be balanced pretty well (based on 1 play). 

There is a nice pace in game, as it's possible to act only a little per turn but all players can take their turns until everyone has passed. Gaining benefits but also having some harm about the neighbours is interesting too. 
Now I must mention also that I had some Catan vibes (and the board's hexas didn't reduce them).

Mostly I like how the game looks but I think that those strongholds, temples and sanctuaries look dull, there would have been many ways to make them look more nice... but maybe they were too costly ways!

Resource and timing game, with a lot of area control, and opportunity cost decisions. 14 different factions, all with special ability's, make the game very re-playable. Most of the races feel at least a little different from any other. There is a bit of overlap in some races and some races will be wanting to compete for specific goals more then others. 

The order of the turn player markers, what turn bonuses are available and what other factions are chosen all change the game play for each faction (adding to re-playability). So, while some races feel better then others, and there may be a couple that are generally worse, most of the factions have the chance to be the best faction choice in a given game.

This game is a little complex for the casual gamer.

There is a lot going on in Terra Mystica, a lot of which, at first glance, my appear unnecessary, but upon playing everything falls into place. There is much to do and much to consider in this game, and several actions have a delicious give-and-take. My big complaint is that the game has a tendency to drag players through it, via round bonuses, rather than giving them the freedom to explore. Everything else though is top-notch, and I appreciate the asymmetry between the races and terrain types.

I am not much for the Euros nor non-coop games, but this being a gift from a friend, we played it at 25 Nov game night.
WOW!
It was a 45 minute explanation from Mike Garee (well done btw).  I thought I was going to just lose outright after I heard the rules.
However, EVERYTHING WORKS SO WELL AND IS ACTUALLY INTUITIVE. I Truly enjoyed my experience... I even came in second (Still think Mike Garee let me get second)
Highly recommend a play at least for anyone not interested in Euros.
Setup is extensive, and settle in for a rules explanation event, but truly a fun experience

This is a Euro that players are optimizing resources in order to position themselves to gain the most points.  The multiple 'races' give an interesting interaction.  Game is definitely best played with a group not akin to analysis-paralysis.  

Played a 2 player, 5 player, and 4 player game.  Definitely better with 4-5 players.  Will probably play 2 factions in next 2 player game.  Uncertain if 3 players would be a 'good' game.  Meta-gaming could have more of an influence on player interaction than actual game play.  Ex: Playing as cultist could have people NOT acquire power resource, which will influence what action are (or not) taken during a cultist game.

Another favorite.  The game looks terribly complicated and confusing, but once you get a couple turns in everything clicks and the fun begins.

Really overwhelming in the beginning. First few games I played I really balked at how many different compartments the game had (area control, resource management, racing up the worship tracks, drastically different racial abilities, and who knows *what* the hell is going on with those bowls!). It felt like a hotchpotch, full of seams. I couldn't see how it all fit together. 

After about the fourth game, though, I started to get a feeling for how tightly interrelated everything is, and by the sixth game -- wow, it all opened up. I now find every game exhilarating and highly satisfying, extremely challenging and complex. The variable goals and races ensure that each game will require a radically different approach. You are forced constantly to evolve, to re-evaluate the merits for this game of a strategy that paid off well in another game. My gaming group is also hooked: they can't believe how much depth the game has. Am definitely looking forward to many, many more months of play.

The rulebook/explanation makes Terra Mystica appear more complicated than it actually is -- at its core, TM is about scoring victory points in a few categories (primarily round-end scoring and racial bonuses, followed by favor tiles, end-game cult track, end-game contiguous size, and city building), all accomplished by spending resources to build/terraform or upgrade various elements. Of course, players need to balance immediate benefits with the resource production engine and correctly tweak said engine on a turn-by-turn basis to cash out. 

Player interaction comes primarily from map interactions, which are more passive-aggressive than aggressive proper, and more direct competition for the once-per-round spells, which usually offer better-than-usual resource conversion rates. There's a variable initial set-up (seating order, faction selection, randomized round bonuses and passing tiles), but there is no randomness after the game starts, both elements that I appreciate. I also appreciate that the bonuses for buildings/upgrades are printed under each building/upgrade (a la Eclipse) in an elegant manner, making it easy to determine income and benefits. The arrows that indicate the building upgrades, however, are not as prominent as one might hope, however. 

All in all, I find Terra Mystica to be a very good game, but not a brilliant one. It does everything well, incorporating ideas from many games that have come before, but it doesn't have the fresh, innovative feel that would make it a 10/10. Or perhaps I'm just an old, cynical gamer at this point.

This game has everything that I appreciate on a game. Plenty of meaningful decisions, many different factions that really change your way to play the game, random setup that makes every game feel different.

Also there is a decent amount of interaction and competition between players without direct conflict. You can plan your game with many different strategies and how you'll try to achieve the victory.

This is a heavy game, keep away if you don't like games that burn your neurons :D

This is not a game in my wheelhouse for fun though I can recognize that for people who like this sort of experience, this game must be nirvana with all the different race powers.  This is the strategy game [i]par excellence[/i] for hobbyists who like dry, action specialization. Those people who detest Agricola’s forced generalization will find refuge here as this one is all about taking one’s race power and maximizing the hell out of it within a narrow opportunity space.

I’ve noticed that I’m a lot less interested in games that ask me to show How to do something vs What I want to do. Giving me end-of-turn VP targets to hit and then asking me to complete them more efficiently than my neighbors leaves me cold since it requires a hyper focus on repetitive efficiency. You’re given an equation and told to show you can solve it then repeat for a different equation next turn. I prefer the creativity of deciding what to do in order to find VPs.

I only have a couple plays of this one, and I could be convinced to give it another try, but for a better implementation of this sort of thing, I think Hansa Teutonica beats it hands down. There you have a lot more creativity as to how to get VPs while still having to achieve a level of action efficiency. And you can get two games in in the same time as one of these.

Best game in my collection.  Not much wrong with it but you need to get the right people to play.  Rules explanation takes about 30 mins if you want to do it well.  No randomness except in the setup.  There were a few rule changes that are worth looking up.  Worst part is that it doesn't have a 2-3 player board.  That back side is not used for a map.  Very disappointed in that.  The expansion is double sided but still doesn't have a 2-3 player side it just a different version of the 2-5 player board.

I love, love, love:
- the power/bowls mechanism
- the asymmetric players
- that it's a Euro-y, somewhat complex engine builder
- the many wooden components
- looking at my city/cities and buildings at the end of the game and seeing how I've expanded my faction

I dislike:
- that the theme is rather pasted-on
- that should you do one or two bad turns, you really fall behind
- that some of the favor cards are clearly the best to gain regardless of faction

Final verdict: This game is so Euro-y and complex and deep and interesting to play but feels dry and point-salad-y. On the other hand, I do like figuring out the game and playing something different like this occasionally.

Fantastic civilization builder. Balance long term growth with victory point opportunities. It has enough races to keep the game fresh, and each player count also changes the game dramatically.

Some people have complained that the influence/magic bowls feel tacked on, but their manipulation is what drives the interest in the game for me.  You want to burn off some of it, but you can't lose too much or certain actions will be lost, or you can top out lower than you should.

I have a very specific game-type that I like, even though I still appreciate a great game. I say this because I tend to rate games much more on how the game play is to me rather than overall. 

So, I give Terra Mystica a perfect score for several distinct reasons. First is the round/action set up. The turn capabilities is outstanding, and is similar to Agricola in that respect. You are always building towards being able to do as much as possible per round, and generally the more resources, the more actions you can do per round (obviously). This makes the gameplay very intense, but also every action you make has to be strategically planned out.  

Second is the scoring. Scoring is consistent, and also goes throughout the game. You need consistent scoring per round as well as at the end to win. This is a bit different from most board games of this prestige, which makes TM incredibly unique but also makes you sweat. Love the intensity and anxiety a game can give you.

Third is the territory building. TM is like a combination of Settlers of Catan (territory building/civilization) and Agricola (economic), with a undescribable intensity that only will come from the likes of a Ticket to Ride game with extremely seasoned players. 

I LOVE THIS GAME.

Edit: 3 games in, lots going on in this game.  The first play I enjoyed it, but the game does start a little slow.  I was concerned in my first play of the game that it wasn't going to live up to the hype it has been receiving. There is a lot going on so it was difficult to tell what a good strategy would be.  The third play I really started to grasp how to score points and ended up doubling my score from the first two games I played.  This is a great game and is in my top 5.

After setting up the board,
We randomly pick a number of races equal to the number of players and then bid VP for them. This works out to be the best way to play this game.

This is our go-to game that we play constantly.

The variety of fantasy races are interesting, since they each seem to play so differently. I especially like the terraforming gameplay. It creates a strong sense of conflict as players decide where to settle their lands and how to expand their empire. Balancing your mana pools was kind of strange, though, and the fact that everything is open information at the beginning of the game is pretty overwhelming. The scoring feels too restrictive to me and makes it hard to get creative.

Just gold in my opinion.  I love every aspect about this game.  I do wish there was a bit more theme to it, but that does not take away from the overall experience.  The expansion is not needed but always welcome as it does not change rules just adds a few characters and they come with a few inserts.  Rule book is a bit overwhelming but one playthrough video and it all makes sense.  Every game I own I try to compare to this and nothing touches it.  Just pure gold.

RATING: 5
One 4p game. There is certainly decent replay value to be had with the different factions, but the different factions are not completely balanced and a few are clear turkeys. This can make it difficult for players with less experience to survive against more experienced players. Some handicapping system for the factions is needed (as evidenced by faction auctioning in the expansion). Yet maybe experienced players can have fun trying to get the turkeys to work in their very specific ways(?).

A comment from one of my Geekbuddys is that after the choice of faction and initial placement, the game largely comes down to how well you execute since there is no luck in the game. I think my one play confirms that: there's not a great deal of interaction and it does feel rather solitaire-y when you play. Sure, you interact with others in available choices and there is some board interaction, but largely you are optimizing in your own little world. I contrast this with a more interactive game like Lords of Xidit where players are constantly bumping into each other resulting in laughs and some disappointments.

For me it all seemed way too long with little reward for the time invested. I'm growing weary of the typical Euro any more so a game had better have something special or unique and this one just doesn't do it for me. I feel like Small World does the multiple faction/ability thing better, it has faction auctioning built-in, and games are fairly quick. Terra Mystica is like Small World without direct interaction, that goes on for hours, and you're stuck with the same race/ability combo the whole time.

I want to like this game, sort of like how it wants to have a theme. Unfortunately, neither situation really works out. The power cycle is clever, but slow. But...

There's no combat! It's a civ game FULL of potential plays that would be acts of war in other civ games. Yet inexplicably, these fantasy races all get along like bread and butter. 

This game would be a lot better if it wasn't such a slave to the unofficial Eurogame combat prohibition. As it is, it's an OK game.

RATING: 6.5
Rating after two full and one partial play.  Multiple resource management game where the fun element will be destroyed by players with too much analysis paralysis (long game, waiting for your turn, and relatively few turns in a game).  Really could do with a walkthrough for each race for first and/or second turns.  Does get easier with repeated play.  Felt very abstract and didn't grab me as "my sort of game" but I can see it appealing to lots of people.

RATING: 8
This initially seems very complex but the game play flows very well and the board becomes very self explanatory. It can be a bit brain burning at times but there is short term strategy as well as long term development of far reaching plans. It get the balance of this very well.

Huge amount of replayability in this one, not only in that you have 14  factions that all play differently but you also have more actions that you pick each turn than are required for a game thus each game several are unused, and there are more turn victory conditions than required therefore again some remain unplayed each game. 
The victory conditions for a turn are also shuffled randomly and therefore greatly affect the way in which you shape your strategy. 
For example I played as the halflings who gain a victory points per space they use. The final turn of the game gave bonus 2 victory points per spade spent that round and so I player the whole game towards stockpiling my workers to turn into spades to rack up silly points in the last round (this almost won me the game... almost) If this tile had been lower down the track i.e. earlier in the game, then this wouldn't have been a valid strategy.

In the first game we played the action that gained you a cultist was one of the ones removed from play therefore it was very difficult to gain priests therefore there was very little interaction with the cultist board. A second game where this power is included may mean the cultist board is more prominent in the game and therefore tactics will be very different again.

The magic power mechanic is really nice as you can always use it to make one of the three resources (priests,workers,cons) if you have miscalculated and end up a few short therefore you don't end up missing a turn because of a lack of components. It also encourages you to build your civilisation close to other players, but not so close they could block you off and thus hurt your expansion.

Really nice components and the board is very pretty however we found several times that the components were called names based upon flavour instead of what they did in the game and therefore there was confusion about what components were which, but as this was a first game this will change over time, although I suspect I shall forever refer to the dwellings as houses and the trading posts as towns due to the shape of the piece and thus confuse everyone.

Really looking forward to many more games of this as I suspect it may become a favourite with our group.

Very impressive game!  Love the vast selection of competing race factions.  Also love the circular flow of the player board... which is a huge improvement over Hansa Tuetonica.  Lots of replayability from the different races and the random initial setup (both on round incentives and available bonus tiles when a player ends his turn.  Very good interaction!  It also has an interesting collaborative mechanic with the "power bowl" system (and how players can "leech" off others).  It's a unique system in its own right and one I expect will be copied by future designs.

Definitely need more games to see how the tense interaction really plays out.  I can see this possibly growing on me even more and scoring higher with more experience.  But the first couple tries were very fun.  I do think the game is overpriced, but at least you do get a lot of wood inside!  Also interesting is how both Terra Mystica and Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar utilize similar "temple tracks" (along with a system of benefits players can receive based on the level they reach - along with a rule that only 1 person can exist at the topmost spot).

Terra Mystica is clearly an excellent design. It's deep and hugely replayable, the production is clear and didactic. However, after two plays I feel it's too heavy to play casually, but the number of games you'd have to play to properly comprehend the different factions and how to best play them in any given situation and player count is too high, at least given the game's length. Bottom line, it seems like a great game, I'm just not sure I actually enjoyed playing it, or not enough to devote that kind of time to it.

I appreciate this as a tight tense euro strategy game, but the fairly bare bones mechanical connections are the very definition of "Just Another Soulless Euro" - but when the euro is this well-designed, it is still enjoyable to play. The factions are really what make the game for me. I'm glad a friend owns a copy.

Played 10+ times with 2-4p.
Ratings history: 10|10|8..|6....|4|6 
Ratings prediction: Solid 6

[b]Somewhat-abstract, dense p-euro that provides a nice mix of resource management, expansion, and improvements. The variation from play to play is fairly minor. I'll occasionally play a friend's copy.[/b]
PROS
- 14 factions allows for some variation
- nice visual presentation
- the gameplay on the map (i.e. terraforming and settling) is great fun
- slightly better than the average point-salad
- some fun confrontational aspects (blocking off) is mitigated by the help that comes from having opponents on your borders.
CONS
- very dense ruleset
- p-euro (if euros are not your thing)
- the theme is well chosen, but the game is still fairly dry
- not as much variation as you'd think, given the factions, actions, and round markers


My [b]first play[/b]: Definitely not nearly as strong as a 2p game, as a decent amount of the tension of the game comes from the power awarded for proximity to opposing players. Still, it's easy to see that this game offers at least 10 plays of interesting exploration (perhaps much more than that with the right gaming group). Very smart decision by the publisher to include 14 factions.

My third play wasn't great, but I can't figure out how much is the game, and how much is me. We played starting set-up - again - which I think is less interesting, but still, the pursuit of victory points is roughly similar every game, and the differentiation of factions just isn't that...different.

RATING: 6.8
This is a complicated game taking several hours to play.  Fascinating because the avenues for unique play each time are astronomical.  I guess this game has a cult following, especially with online play.  Knowing the game, playing often, planning ahead with intense attention to detail & character abilities and faults is essential to a high score.  Before I play this again, need to spend a few hours studying the components & characters. 

I give this a rating much lower than it deserves because to become good at this game I would want to play it 2-3 times a week, which would take a huge chunk of time which I don't have for just one game--although I can see myself getting caught into its web.  If I continue to play I am sure my rating will advance.  Also pricey since the expansion adds so much to the game.  Rules were explained very nicely to me, but introducing a newby takes a long time.

I also weighted this game at the full 5 for this reason:  the 14 factions each have their own advantages & therefore game plan.  There can be up to 5 players.  In order to play this game effectively, I feel I have to know & remember the special abilities of each of the opposing groups, and continually re-evaluate their game plan and not overlook any of their possible goals during any of the many actions they take.  This part of the game takes playing experience, and still is a brain burner.

I'm glad I finally played this.

There is a lot to like with the various mechanics of changing terrain, building, upgrading, getting resources.  The power stuff seemed tacked on, same with the religion tracks.

There is no more than a thin veneer of a theme here.  I didn't feel like I was a nomad changing terrain to desert to build up my empire.  I felt like I was dropping a new terrain disk and plopping a building in a few places.

I would play this again, but I don't have a need to suggest it.

I like the geographic interaction, the mana system, the Hansa Teutonica style uncover-to-reveal-powers, the upgrade tree, and the differential costs for terrain, as well as the wildly different factions with different styles of play. The VP chasing, cube collection, drafting and track races were pretty meh though, and the interaction felt kind of low despite the positive interaction (trading post discount, the mana bonuses).

Only one play in, Terra Mystica feels like a middle-weight Euro pushed to the extreme.  This sounds like it might be a great thing, and I think it some ways it is.  However, I wonder if it's enough to compete with the heavy-weight economic games that have more compelling player interaction.  Many games that have fairly one-dimensional player interaction feel like you spend some time creating a grocery list of stuff to do/buy in the beginning of the game and then the rest of the game is just about doing the work of proceeding down that list with minor adjustments when the store is out of what you wanted.  If Terra mystica can't be played fairly consistently in under two hours with 4, the more boring part of the game ( the execution of your list) will begin to eclipse the more interesting part (the creation of your list).  To be really enjoyable, though, I think it'll need to clock closer to 1.5 hours.  This could go up a little, but could also drop a point to where I won't actively recommend playing it.

A game that is bone dry, has a dull theme and an even duller looking board. Playing it however is a real joy. Every round you have to figure out how to best use your meager resources.

The variable scoring opportunities each round combined with the various races make this game amazingly interesting. Each time I play it I have to improve my rating. Great game!

Terra Mystica is a perfect information game with limited player interaction that works surprisingly well.  I'm a little surprised that it's so high in the BGG ratings compared to some of my favorites, but then again, I am rating it a 9 myself.  There is a lot of opportunity for clever planning with so many options for each turn.  My favorite part of the game is the way the special "power" actions have been designed: power is its own currency that can be gained in a few different ways and used for actions that often can't be done any other way.  The many races with their own special abilities will keep this game fresh and interesting with each play.  I don't care for the fantasy "theme", but thankfully the theming doesn't play a big role in what actually happens during the game. I wouldn't want to play this with people who have severe AP, but this a feast for the puzzle-lover's senses!

RATING: 8
Take an economic engine, spread it over wide terrain and introduce an abstract concept of power or influence, and you have Terra Mystica.

The game is at its core an economic engine, but one which it takes slight experience to master; different race combinations make it fresher every time, but at the end of the day everybody is trying to approach a victorious endgame through multiple paths. Annoyingly, there is no conflict as such; unless you count blocking territory and terraforming land away from a player's desired terrain.

This lacks the points-salad approach of a Feldian design, which is a good thing; unfortunately it also lacks variety despite the different races. That said, I cannot say I have ever had a boring or unchallenging game; whilst I decry the lack of a variant board overleaf (they could have used that space to make one more suitable for fewer players), I adore the fact that every decision is meaningful.

The few shortcomings (which were mostly unavoidable, apart from the board thing) prevent me from rating this game above 8 - and it's the fun and challenge I have had which got it there.

Thanks to the random placement of the score tiles and bonus tiles, along with the variety of races with unique special abilities, there is an endless potential for variety, providing a different experience each play. I really enjoy a game like this in which you are making progress toward a goal and accomplishing something without luck or other players destroying all of your hard work. In that respect it reminds me a little of Village. Every decision could be game-changing. Win or lose I walk away thinking, "That was a great game!"

I really wanted to like this game.  I went into it with a clean slate, not having read anything about the game other than it was trending a lot on BGG.

After the rules explanation, I knew I was not going to like the game.  For me, it feels too much like a re-skinning of Settlers of Catan without any semblance of a theme.  The game feels too disconnected and auto-pilot and the lack of a theme really aggravates me.

That's not to say that the game play is terrible, it actually plays quite well.  But for my standards and expectations in games I enjoy, this was a miss.

My son and I enjoyed the game immensely. There are so many ways to score points that I can't imagine the game ever getting dull. The various races also keeps the game fresh. For future games my son and I will divide the board in half for more interaction.

I'm so glad I purchased this game. The first time I played it was at Origins. The guy teaching it it did a very poor job and pretty much ran over the other two newbies and myself. The game was disliked at that point. I decided to give it another go especially when my son expressed interest, and I'm glad I did. I look forward to introducing this game to my game group (where I know I will thoroughly get trounced as they are simply better at these types of games than I am), but I know it will be a positive experience.

So I introduced the game for the first time to my main gaming group. All but one of which was an experienced gamer. I think this is a fun game buried underneath a pile of rules. While most of the rules aren't challenging to understand there are a lot of them! I think the group mostly enjoyed it but I found myself answering questions nearly every other round. I think this game could easily be rated 8 or higher with a group that has played through the game a few times.

Egy játék után még nehéz megítélni. Annyira nem bonyolult, mint amire számítottam, és talán annyira nem is fárasztó- Gyorsan elröpült vele az a 3,5 óra. :)
Nem merek ilyenben ítélkezni egy játék után, de fajok képessége elsőre nem tűnt teljesen kiegyenlítettnek, pedig az ajánlott alapszettel játszottunk. Itt a nomádok és a félszerzetek elég erősnek tűntek, míg a boszik és az óriások gyengébbnek.
-------
Jó játék, de nem tartom annyira, mint amekkora a hype körülötte. Bárki bármit mond, nincsenek ezek a fajok teljesen kiegyensúlyozva. Definíció szerint nem is lehetnek, hiszen az eseménylapkák nagyon el tudják billenteni egyik-másik javára a partit. Jó lenne valami licit az elején a fajokra az eseménylapkák ismeretében. Ez esetben tényleg csak a tudás döntene.

Továbbra is fenntartom, hogy nincs meg a teljes egyensúly. De rengeteg az újrajátszási lehetőség. Jellemzően minden fajjal minimum 2x szeretnél játszani és már ez sok-sok óra szórakozást jelent.

Terra Mystica is not a resource conversion game. It is not a connection game, either. Nor is it an area majority game. While all of these elements are present in one form or another you can pretty much ignore any one of them and go after something else entirely. Of course, the various special powers may make taking one of those avenues much more attractive than another. In a way it is quite surprising that with so many different routes to follow and so varied incentives players still get in each other's way all the time.

The game includes a lot of material, special powers here and bonus chits there. That makes the game seem much more complicated than it really is. Individual turns are fairly short and simply enough. The real benefit of all the options, however, should be long-term replayability. Promising.

Ohne TERRA MYSTICA kein Feuerland, ohne Feuerland kein TERRA MYSTICA: Die gegenseitige Geburtsstunde markiert einen ähnlichen Evolutionspunkt in der Entwicklung des Eurogame wie es zuvor z.B. PUERTO RICO, CAYLUS oder AGRICOLA getan haben, die mit ihren Ideen nachfolgende Spielejahrgänge nachhaltig geprägt haben und es bis heute tun. Dabei brauchte TERRA MYSTICA einen langen Atem um bahnbrechend und weltweit die Brettspielwelt zu erobern. Die ersten Ideen zu TERRA MYSTICA entstanden Mitte der 90er als CATAN noch die Lande beherrschte, die TERRA MYSTICA nun seit 2012 umgräbt. Dabei beschränkte sich TERRY MYSTICA nicht nur darauf einfach einen neuen Mechanismus zu kreieren, sondern gleich ein neuartiges Spielkonzept zu erfinden, das seinesgleichen vergeblich suchte: allein die konzeptionelle Leistung individualisierte Völker mit speziellen, asymmetrischen Fähigkeiten in immer neuen Konstellationen dennoch ausgeglichen aufeinanderprallen zu lassen, ist genauso großartig wie Frank Heerens Mut, in diese neue Spielidee in einen extra dafür neu gegründeten Verlag zu investieren. The Birth of TERRA MYSTICA und Feuerland ist ein verdientes Symbol dafür, dass sich wahre unternehmerische Risikobereitschaft an Kreativität orientiert, die sie verkaufen will und nicht am Profit, denn sie damit erzielen will. Helge Ostertags Spiel war von Anfang an eine Herzensangelegenheit, denn nur so lässt sich der lange Entwicklungsweg mit durchhalten, um zum Schluß immer noch VOR der Zeit mit einem Spiel für die Zukunft zu landen. TERRA MYSTICA war ein neuer Bewusstseinsschritt. Völker, hört die Signale: ein weltmeisterlicher Wurf mit der Schippe.

This game has many things I love
- Fantasy theme
- Variable player powers
- planning ahead
- good amount of player interaction - you can follow your plans but have to react to the actions of other players often enough that it doesn't become scripted.

29/01/2016: I really like the collaborative aspect of the game. Playing on your own isn't an option, but somehow the tension for terrain conquering creates a perfect blend.
28/03/2016: This game is amazing. It changes so much each time you change faction. Our group is just exploring and we discover new strategies every game.
23/09/2016: the best game our group can play: interactive, strategic, always different

ufff.. this game blow my mind, I never thought I would be able to understand what you have to do to win. Everything seems to give points, and bits, and good stuff,.. It is very difficult to tell to new players what is the best thing to do, at the same time it seems that any upgrades you take will benefit you sooner or later. There is a lot of things to keep track of. I personally like it, but I think there is too much going on for what it is. Although is a beautiful board game it feels you are just moving cubes.

Two Plays: A true 'classic' imo, after only two plays. I have a copy on the way from Germany (and much cheaper than FunAgain, including shipping). 

I really love it. I seldom rate a game after so few games, but I know this one will be at least a 9. I suspect it will join my '10' group, a very exclusive group of games, with a few more plays. Not easy to explain, but very intuitive to play. Lots of depth and replay-ability. 

Three Plays: It's a 10! Only downside - our group plays slow - but, we enjoy a less hectic approach to gaming.

Six Plays: Still playing with the beginners set-up. Have 5 people trained to play it. Ready to move to the Random set-up. Love it. 

Ten plays: using random set-ups. Still loving it and feel there is so much yet to discover. I have only played a few of the 14 races, so far (Nomads, Witches, Fakirs, Alchemists, Chaos Magicians, and Swarmlings.) 

14 Plays: my favorite game of all time. The more you play it, the more you see to do. 

20 Plays: Not even beginning to tire of it! Still as great as ever. THE BEST ALL-TIME GAME FOR ME!

Its a big game, and yet not so complex to be ridiculously off-putting.  The amount of game in this box is staggering.  Would I ever buy it? No.  Would I want to play it on a typical Friday board game night? No.  This is for that special event game day, but such an excellent choice.  Just make sure everyone has a copy of the rules to make sure everyone doesnt screw up the rules in such a long game.  So, how do you rate such a game, in this context, as it really is on the outer edge of my comfortable gaming experience, is 7.854 (Dec 2015).

TM lives up to the hype. I didn't come away from it feeling that it had introduced anything new into the genre, as a lot of these mechanics have been used before (other than the Power system, which I found very intriguing). But what masterful integration of all the mechanics! Although it shares little mechanically with Settlers of Catan, it feels like Catan on crack! Expanding and upgrading your civilization through payment of resources: check. Getting in the way of your opponent's building progress: check. There's even a sort of 'longest road' final score. (Okay: largest town here). Anyway, a real celebration of a game for those who feel Euros are the great savior of the gaming industry.

My favorite game of all. The only 10 in my collection. The best euro game I have ever played. The only critique I have is that it can't shine with only two players because the lack of "scaling" mechanics, you aren't hindered enough with just 2 ppl, be it on the power actions, the cult tracks or on building space. From 3 players onward, nearly infinite replayability.

Themeless Euro.  Really doesn't work for two players.  Different player classes are VERY different and add interesting variability to strategies.  Downside for me is that you can't advance on all the temple tracks in a meaningful way and there's no bonus for getting to the top even though it's very difficult.  This game can run long and is very prone to AP.

TM seems, in a significant degree, to have the two characteristics that I like best in a game.  

1. It is [b]truly strategic[/b] - my definition: you can plan you mid and end game right after seeing the setup.  

2. Also, it is [b]explosive[/b] - you can set up big turns where your position advances exponentially.

After 6 plays in 3 days, it starts at a "9" rating and joins the list of my most favorite games.  I'm almost ready to say that it has dethroned Age of Steam as my favorite Euro.

So far, I have three wins in six plays: one with the Alchemists, one with the Dwarves and one with the Halflings.   Notable scores: 114 (w/ Dwarves) and 135 with the Halflings.

So glad I finally got this to the table.  After just one play, my mind is already swimming with strategies to try in the future.  It felt a little bit like the first few plays of Age of Steam for me, in that I didn't care how I did - I just wanted to figure out ways to keep moving forward and expand.  

The Dwarves did not impress me, although the starting income helped for the first round.  I should have taken advantage of the tunnelling power more, but a lack of workers doomed me.

Obtained my Z Man edition from Miniature Market. It has been a long time since I paid this much money for a board game as I prefer to trade for games or find them in thrift stores or on sale.  But this one was different - I believe it is truly special. 
Update: While I have enjoyed this game, I decided to trade my copy because A) it doesn't support two players well and B) the games are too long for my taste. For a long game it seems to have a bottle rocket trajectory as to the time required to accomplish one's plan and it just seems inadequate.

Beautifully constructed game, lots of variable setup potential.  The balance of the various race powers seems very good, but they do direct your strategy to make best use of them.  Every game slightly different due to the differing powers, the mix and order of the scoring tokens and differing mix of bonus tiles. Lovely pieces.  Time comes down once you get a few plays in - looking at 1.5-2 hrs (in fact, what it says on the box).  Impressed.

Excellent euro resourse collection/VP conversion with lite civ building - adds some limited player interaction by linking some points to the proximity on the board of your own and your opponent's buildings. 14 different starting races and VP objectives are variable by game and by turn within games, both these factors adding to replayability.  

The rule book is very well laid out and easy to get into the game, icongraphy is good. Excellent bits. Excellent.

I'm a little confused about this game. I like it and dislike it at the same time. It seems like it's all the euro games in one game.

I have played it a couple of times and I had a slightly good time, not great time for sure.

RATING: 5
Update: After a few more plays, I just don't find this game very fun. All of the systems work together, and the different races are somewhat interesting, but it just doesn't produce an fun game to play. There's some amount of interaction between the players, but you don't feel the differences between the races you're playing against. So it feels very different to play with the Darklings than it does to play with the Mermaids, for instance, but it doesn't feel any different to play against the Darklings or against the Mermaids. Nor is there an overarching goal in the game that gives you an idea of why you're doing what you're doing. Points here and there for building, cults, points when you pass... So it all works together but falls flat.

------

My impression is that this is a good game, but I am a little surprised that it is getting so much acclaim.

Everything is clean and works well together. But there is very little competition or interaction at all. This means that if the variable faction powers happen to match up well with the bonus tiles, there is nothing anyone else can do to stop that person. So your most important decision might be the one you make before the game starts, of which faction to play.

Everything is very abstract, as well. The faction powers don't seem tied to the actual factions, magic is just pushing disks around. Still, definitely a good point-efficiency game with a small smattering of different player powers.

RATING: 7.5
This game was extremely hyped. Upon reading the rulebook, I was reminded of the decision making of Dominant Species, which I love....

*Cue: excitement!*

Playing it however...I'm not sure how to feel. The theme made no sense. It's a mish-mash of mechanisms, I feel player interaction is low, much much lower than Dominant Species, and your goals (particularly for end game) don't seem so readily apparent. (Besides a mad dash up the cult tracks. :-/) The races have odd powers that don't match their fantasy stereotype, IMO.

It's a clever euro design I suppose. It just lacks, well, FUN.
It did NOT give me the 'feeling' I get when playing DomSpec.

This game.... I am dumbfounded on how good it was.  It took some time to learn, and the game itself is in no way short, but I love it.  My friends and I finished a game that started at 10pm at 2am, and we were blown away on what we had just played.

This game is about choices, you have so many choices to make.  If you make the wrong choice you can set yourself back quickly.  

The races are fun, and so well balanced.  There is a great in game balancing mechanism so one player is going to run away with the game.

I really can't describe on how amazing this game is... in lack of a better term, it is PERFECT.

Raised my rating to 6 after my second game.

I have a weird relation to this game. It is certainly not a bad design, nor something that I would stay away from.

Nonetheless, not only I never feel the need to play it, but I'd rather play a bunch of other Euros.

This is one of the rare cases in which the sum of good parts makes for a bad ensemble. 

The mechanisms, some original some not, are nice taken by themselves (the temple track, the cool power accumulation, the digging) but they don't intertwine in a meaningful way, thus making for quite a dry experience.

The in-game scoring system is boring and arbitrary.

Too bad, the idea is nice.

Also, waaaaay to long for what is, after all, not so-clever a game.

[b]Terra Mystica[/b] [i]Jens Drögemuller - Helge Ostertag 2012[/i]
A fantastic eurogame. Sure it does not add anthing new, and it has no high dosis of interaction, but as an eurogame it is a wonderful design. There are fourteen races in the game and all of them have their little nouances, but are wonderfully balanced. Every time you play you must adapt yourself not only to your race skills but also to its drawbacks. Rules and quite easy to grasp and the game scales very well for three, four and five players. I strongly recomend it and actually in my book Terra Mystica is the best game of the year 2012 hands down. If you dont need high interaction and dont worry about theme in games, this could be one of the best options currently available in the market. It is a bit pricey though (around 65 euros in Europe) but it worths every single penny.

very fun, medium level game that has so many different options to win. I dont think its technically a worker placement, but it definitley has that feel to it with the consistant ability to block other peoples moves. The only gripe I have about this game, which isn't a fair one, is that it is a very complex game if its your first time playing. There is alot to teach, which makes sense once you use what you learn, but because of this im hesistant to bring it out because some people cant grasp games like this and get scared :(

It's fine. I like Scythe or any of the metagot dudes on a map games better. The reason for this preference is that in TM there is always an optimisation problem and it can get very analytical whereas the others have a little more art and are more forgiving if you play by instinct. Plus they look better. Glad I tried the classic though. (played the app a bit before getting bored)

And like...after 2-3 hours all I've done is built 4 or 5 buildings next to people.

Asymmetric play is a good idea. Also the mechanic of taking piece off the player board and using it on game board, while freed space on player board is giving you abilities, is also a very good, but not a new idea - it is well implemented in Hansa Teutonica, which was invented several years before this. However Hansa Teutonica you can play at least three times, while playing only one time Terra Mystica. But those things are the best part of Terra Mystica. The rest is quite annoying - theme is quite boring and more abstract than in most euros. Irritating delayed rondel (purple bowls) is also one of the most non-elegant solutions for taking more player actions I have seen. I recommend learning from Stefan Feld, how he does things in his games. Also, although this is a heavy strategy game, it is a little bit boring and therefore it is a way too long for what it offers. Overall - OK game, but not among the best strategy games.

I enjoyed this game from the first time I played, but it wasn't until quite a few plays in that I realised how strong the repeat play value is. I'd just tried playing as Engineers for the first time, and lost badly. Rather than being put off by that faction, I wanted to go back and play as them again to see how I could make the game work for them.

I also love the theme and world of this game. At first glance it looks like a bunch of high fantasy cliches, but I find it fascinating thinking about how all these different fantasy beings adapting to an industrial revolution of sorts, how they transform the world around them in a world in which magic exists. On top of that, the mixing of theme and mechanics is perfect - every special rule for each faction makes absolute sense.

You won´t play TM for its beauty, you won´t play it for its theme and you won´t play it for its innovative mechanics either. But you will play it for it´s a solidly designed Eurogame that is medium weighted.
Normally you choose between 8 options which are easily graspable. It´s the optimal chain of your actions that is a bit of a brainburner. Furthermore your plans may be baffled by your fellow players as some common spots on the map are already blocked. I liked the "when I pass first, then I will be starting player next round and I can choose a bonus for next round as well".
All in all it did not feel that fresh but not old fashioned either. In case you doubt; I did like it but will not buy it myself.
edit: already after a second play I doubt that there is despite different races enough variety to make this a long term favorite.

Beautiful components, awfully interesting mechanics.

I'm fascinated, since you obviously need to be obstructive of other players, when you also need their willing collaboration and good relations. A fine balance is required. 

Please, please, do not try to explain this game. Explanation will require at least 40 minutes. While you'll really understand it better by simply trying to play through a turn or two. 

Definitely a gamer's game, I totally recommend it. 


UPDATE
After my third serious game I'll turn this game down a 0.1 or two. The races are not completely balanced. I'm also not bought on the art. For as interactive that it seems to be, I'm starting to think that this game tends to become a multiplayer solitaire.

UPDATE

It doesn't work perfectly with two players, and the factions are famously unbalanced in a way that the auction only fixes with experienced players. But we love playing this as a couple. 

While there is no accounting for taste--my affection for this game is slightly irrational-- I do not understand the hatred this game inspires among "thematic" gamers. I find the raising and spreading of one's fantasy city totally immersive as an imaginative experience.

How do I rate a good game that I don't actually want to play? I see its draw—it allows the consummate fan of the Euro to enjoy a game without any direct player interaction, multiple interlocking pathways to victory, economic optimization with the friction of currency exchange inefficiencies, variable player powers, etc.

I like many of these things, but when I play Terra Mystica, it strikes me as tactically overwrought because it practically invites players to make short-term decisions that wipe out opponents' strategic choices without a way to mitigate or repair them. It is also prone to analysis paralysis, because it requires some long-term strategic planning to maximize points—but such strategies are easily foiled by the high-intensity tactics (e.g., cities need juxtaposed adjacencies, but can be stopped easily). Strategic failures are very costly and hard to recover from. The possible AP (especially in a five player game) makes it so that a player who has been constructively eliminated must drudge through the remainder of the game trying in good faith to lose with dignity—or he may be left to kingmaking—ironic for a Euro game without any direct player interaction.

It's a game for bean counters who like very well made beautiful components.

Eclipse is a better game.

Dominant Species is a far superior game in the same vein—better because you can discard your strategy in DS more easily if you need to without being stuck in old decisions that you can't mitigate.

I can't tell if I liked this, or just rejoiced in the amazing UI design. The asymmetry didn't really connect for me (maybe because, while there's plenty of player interaction, the player powers felt isolated from that interaction, on a first play) but it was pleasant enough. Just not the third-best game I've played in any category, let alone third-best full stop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wonderful production. Awesome replayability from the asymmetrical races alone, even before considering how deep the game is. Cult track and power are interesting in their own right but integrate nicely with the rest of the game such that they don't feel overly out of place. Tons of strategic depth here. Lots of routes to victory with most races lying somewhere along the spectrum of town-focused to cult-focused (Of course with exceptions).

Some time issues with my playgroup but forcing people to play faster the second time through made it feel so perfect. Now we make a good pace of it and are finishing just a bit long of the games advertised playtime.

Don't care much for the extra scoring tiles in F/I, new races are fun but really unnecessary for how much replayability the game already has. New double sided board is nice though, and cloth bags are sexy. Overall a seemingly non-essential expansion, but nice nonetheless.

Nice engine, maybe briliant engine building mechanism.   No connection between engine and theme. Mechanics are the core and purpose.  It's an optimalisation game, fortunately with some player interaction (with 5 players, otherwise more soloplay in a group), and maybe the most appealing to me in its sort, but it still lingers on the premise that a game should be computable. Which is in the end severely boring to me.

RATING: 5
Brutally complex, seemingly unending setup/teardown time, and a rulebook that makes players groan in exasperation every time I try and teach it.  Just far too much overhead for the amount of fun it actually delivers.  Other Eurogames do this better and more efficiently.

RATING: 7
Hated it the first time i played, but liked it the second and third.  I definitely enjoy the different race powers, even though some seem harder to figure out strategies for than others.

The only aspect I don't like that much is the sacrifices to move up the cult tracks.  Doesn't mesh with the rest of the game in my opinion, and is usually why I lose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game. It requires the right group to play with though. It's pretty heavy and fiddly, so there's plenty of opportunity for AP if any of the players are prone to that. I played with a good group and enjoyed it.

My turns came around fairly quickly and I had consequential decisions to make every time. The actions of other players had enough impact on me that I was engaged even when it wasn't my turn.

I like the terraforming mechanic. It's novel without being gimmicky. It seems like the special powers of the various characters would substantially change the strategies employed each game, which is a good thing.

RATING: 6.5
The game needs some serious balancing. The different races are totally unbalanced. If two players are playing top races and the others get to choose among what's left, they have little chance to win right off the bat.

The idea is great, but it lacks work, especially on the racial abilities. Like the Fakirs are the worst of all.

I was told that in the expansion there are actually two races that are even worse than the Fakirs!

The game is also extremely expensive for a very ordinary content. I mean, it's the price of a game with miniatures but you have none. Just a bunch of ugly woodden blocks!

So instead of getting an 8.5 from me, this gets a 7 due to poor balancing of races and thus poor playtesting.

[After first game - rating 4]
This game is a prototype for all dull, heavy and overly complicated Eurogames.  Victory points everywhere, half a dozend different mechanisms, no recognizable theme whatsoever.  

Worker cubes, priest meeples, magic tokens, 4 different tracks for collecting majority points, 5 different buildings with different costs and income, 4 different city markers, 12 different special tiles, 7 different extra action spots, 14 different races with different special abilities, 6 different end-of-turn markers  etc. etc.  Get this, get that, turn this into that, get extra point here, get end-of-game points there. 

Bottom line: there's surely a lot of work to do.  But where's the game in this mess?  

--------------------------------------------------------

[Edit after the second game - rating 6]
Ok, maybe a rating of 4 is too harsh.  Played it a second time this weekend and the game was slightly better.  The aspect of building next to different players (to collect magic power) in contrast to build on your own (to have more room) is interesting.  
Raised rating to 6.

--------------------------------------------------------

[Edit after 4th game - rating 7.5]
I must admit that my initial impression was wrong.  This is in fact a quite faszinating Eurogame. Its all about timing to grab the various scoring opportunities as they come along.  Not sure however, how good the races are balanced.  Raised rating to 7.5.

--------------------------------------------------------

[Edit after 7th game - rating 8.5]
Ok, ok I've learned my lesson.  Never rate a (complex) game until you've tried it several times.  Regarding TM: I'm hooked.  What a fine game with so many interesting decisions.  A warning to new players though: beware this beast!  It's deep, it's complex and it may take a while until you recognize its full potential :)

This is not what one expects from a game with Fantasy races on a map. First and foremost, there is no direct confrontation. Instead, there is a strange concept of changing terrain that seems directly taken from the computer game series "Disciples". The players do that to build, because each race can only build in one type of terrain, and building is the core of the game. In most cases, however, the players change the terrain and build in the same action. As terrain has no other effect in the game, the whole thing feels unnecessary.

In fact, there are many unnecessary elements. This is the Euro brother of your typical, overly complex Fantasy Flight game, where the designers add as much stuff as they can. There are eight different standard actions, most costing two different resources (money and workers or priests), and half a dozen more printed on the board, costing mana. Then there are the tiles that each player chooses for the next round, most giving two different benefits. And each round has a two-part event that affects everyone. And certain buildings also allow you to choose from a dozen tokens with two benefits. And if you manage to form a city, you choose a token from a different set. And so on, and so forth.

However, unlike a Fantasy Flight game, it comes with ugly and generic wooden pieces instead of nice plastic miniatures that would have enhanced the theme presentation. There is simply no immersion. The players may, for example, advance in elemental tracks, but the game does nothing interesting with that and there aren't any differences between the four elements. The only sign of theme is in the particulars of each race. They are actually so unique that it is very hard to tell how well they are balanced, but my first impression is that some are much better than others. Besides, it appears the order of events may also favor some races much more.

I didn't have a bad experience, but it was far from exciting or fun. There is just too much to keep track and consider for too little payoff.

Another top dog in my collection. Liking it more and more after every play, so could be rated 10 one day. (28.3.2016)

Finally got to play this again after a long break. It's still awesome! You craft a rudimentary long-term strategy right from the start because there's no randomness but other players' actions force you to adapt your strategy all the time.

Love this game. I told my kids that this game is so unique and special in that there is no luck. And of course, my 11 year old daughter corrected me - that the scoring tiles on the right side of the board are randomly drawn each round, and they may work out in your favor or your opponent's favor, and that is certainly some luck.  I had to correct myself to "very little luck." There's a lot going on, but not too much. Definitely my favorite.

RATING: 4
Impressive that there is no randomness except for the initial setup: the initial player turn order, the choice of bonus tiles, and the choice and order of the 6 round-scoring tiles.

The main reason I dislike this game: with temple favours and city bonuses and power conversions, there are so many possible actions on one turn, and it takes a lot of thinking to come up with the ideal move (especially because you also have to analyze other players' capabilities and motives as well).  The fact that there often is a best move on a turn drives me into analysis paralysis -- I want to analyze all possible moves so I'm sure I didn't miss anything, or I'll feel bad afterwards for having missed it! 

After playing this a handful of times, I don't find it worth the effort any more.  It seems that since there is so little randomness, the most important decision you can make is the initial choice of faction (which depends on what other factions have been taken, and which scoring and bonus tiles are available).  I don't know the factions well enough to figure out the best one given the initial conditions.  And then it's important to choose your initial dwelling placements well.  In short, you could lose the game during the initial setup, before you take a turn!  I think I'll pass on this game from now on.

A fair amount of rules explanation, so we didn't start playing until 8pm, and finished at 10pm with the game unfinished, Michael's halflings leading at that point. Very nice game, would like to go again, and would easily finish a second game, turns actually were not taking very long after a couple of turns each.

I see this game as a throw-back to older games (i.e., '95-2005) that could not have happened without some of the more recent trends in game design. Here we see the inter-meshing of a 'traditional' Euro economic engine (i.e., spend money to make more money; rinse, repeat, optimize), a strong spatial play element (i.e., board-play that is multi-linear and encourages positional play), and asymmetrical powers (i.e., differing abilities per player). In a time in which many games coming out have boards which serve little more than an organizing function (or at best the spatiality of them is linear; e.g., Le Havre could have been a card game), I very much appreciate the map. While not as elegant as, say as Kramer game of similar weight, I say that this is a 'new' throwback to the old because it carries with it the complexity of many of the 'cult of the new' games (the game(r) market has created a space for publishers to put out more, longer, more complex games) while keeping a very streamlined package within a few hours of play and also incorporating elements that would not have often been seen in earlier Euros (e.g.,the variable player powers which make for great variability between, and within games). Rating will likely go up with more plays.

Really like this game. A bit of a steep learning curve on the front end but such a wonderful game. Not your typical heavy play where you have to play it four or five times before you get the hang of it.  Half way through the first game you start to realize how the different mechanics fit together. This will be one that we definitely bring to the table again and again.

I'm giving this a 9 not based on my sole play which included 5 players and 3 of which were new and i did poorly. Many times when i play a heavier game it takes me about an hour to realize what errors i made and how i would change next time. This is no different. On the surface it seems like a standard euro with cubes but there is much more to it. Tons of choice, smooth game mechanics, and a Small Worldish theme with the variety of races available all with special traits and powers. I wouldn't recommend playing with 5 again, but i can see 3-4 being an absolute blast. Not something i am likely to buy due to my gaming groups tastes, but something i will never turn down at my gaming club.

Solid Euro, nice components, rather steep learning curve.
Usually don't like euros, but i'd play this if nothing else 'd be available.

You get vp's for so MANY different things.. and every turn you get some more vp's for certain actions.. so the game kind of dictates what everyone should go for in a certain turn.. while i kept wanting to do other stuff because it just felt better & would have been more fun & followed my main strategy. That nagged me.

This game is a beast. It might take a while till you understand the rules quite enough to be able to form strategy as well. This is a heavy euro game with really complex rules. One of the most clever design i have ever played but it really needs a few plays to let your strategic view bloom. I love the mana mechanic by burning your mana to get an initial stroke like a bomb at the start of the game. After that you are going to progress rapidly and trying to use your mana points whatever you can or need. I love interactive area control games like Power Grid or Kemet but there is a bit strange kind of interaction going on there. Usually in area control games if you are going to a specific space first you are holding that position till the game ends. But in this one you must collaborate with your neighbours to get more mana point income and of course to build your buildings cheaper. The interaction is all about to get into advantageous places first before your opponents do. There are a ton of choices to choose actions from means that the mathematical aspect is really strong in this one. As the whole game can be calculated quite well means that in contrast paralysis analysis is a big problem here. In a game where the normal playtime is around 2-2,5 hour i believe just one person doing AP means you will be playing it 4 hours long easily and this is way too long for my taste. Each game needs another strategy to pursue as there are 14 very different faction in the basegame. I have to mention that the game artwork is more functional and not really stellar. The wooden game components are well designed and seems to be working well. Altough this game is quite expensive but despite the price tag this can be one of the best price / value game of all time. The 14 very different factions needs to be played differently and this makes up for a good replayability. After a few more plays i absolutely fall in love with this game. This is just fantastic in every aspect truly one of the best designes of all time. It is elegant and entertaining every single time. After about 30 plays i can tell that this is the best boardgame i have ever played!

Terra Mystica is a wonderfully tied together game, with action timing, civ building, area control and other aspects rolled into a yummy fantasy setting.

It's probably best in somewhat larger groups for the interaction, but it offers a low-luck, high emphasis on planning and timing kind of game, and the income and act I on availability chojces flow together like very few other games.

The level of integration of the choices and costs for actions seems very well balanced, in particular.

This one definitely leaps into my top games, very quickly.

Great combination of optimising your people's economic engine, terraforming and conquering enough of the board for that purpose, and not forget about your cultists on the way. The mechanisms may seem a bit dry at first, but the are really ingeniously nifty. Best played with 3+ players. Single critique: having only one map doesn't balance well for different player numbers. Why not print a second map on the back of the board?

I think I like the idea of Terra Mystica more than I actually like Terra Mystica. I love the atmosphere, but I think the jury is still out for me on how I feel about asymmetrical powers (at least in the context of this game). Frankly, after around 20 tries, I've seen Terra Mystica play out predictably from the onset just too many times. Terra Mystica requires a bit too much thought, considering that in the end, it's largely just going to play itself.

Very good game with really clever power mechanics

It's civ building but I think the primary mechanism is still area control.

I think that you're probably at an advantage to have fewer power discs (maybe 7-8 is optimal). Having less means that the ones you have cycle faster.

Very keen to play more. I also want to try more races and see how balanced they all are; I've heard the Giants are terrible. Only rated it as 8.5 because of perceived balance issues

RATING: 7
I think this game is overrated in BGG ranks, especially for those who believe that interaction between players as an essential element of the good game. Here even playing with 4 players, it is always more or less "solitaire point salad" of X players on one board. Negative interaction sometimes may happen is someone will take the terrain you have planned to use for expansion. And you cannot counter this. Also - very nice mechanics of point salad optimization, but no "chrome".

Wow. People enjoy this? It's a long, drawn out victory point salad. Six long rounds of gathering points from a million sources, very low interaction (despite some interdependence), no laughter, no surprises. I have no idea what so many people see in this. Do people actually have fun when they play Terra Mystica? Or just a feeling of excitement? I felt nothing. Just nothing.
(And yes, I do admire the immense work of balancing that was put into this game - whether successful or not, I cannot judge after my few plays. I am just asking myself, why anyone would want to do something like this. As a game designer, this would have felt like all work and no fun to me.)

(05/17/13) Comment on first play.

Despite all the enthusiasm for this game at the recent Geekway to the West, I was underwhelmed. While it looks like a creative blend of Settlers (variable terrain, building hierarchy), Kingdom Builder (contiguous area development), Castles of Burgundy (creative combos; the intricacy screams Stephan Feld), Small World (expansion and variable racial powers), Eclipse (variable number of actions until you're out of stuff, resource tracking), Atilla (cult tracks), Hawaii (variable turn order passing benefits) with some interesting new game mechanisms (mystic power pools, reminiscent of the "mana" in Magic:TG), it is a typical Euro of: Collect Resources-->Build Buildings-->Get Victory Points. There is an area-control spatial element with the board. However, with repeated plays, it seems the fixed board is prone to standard openings, given some specific race. I do wish the map were geomorphic, but I suppose this would introduce balance issues.

The asymmetric racial powers are truly unique, the board and components look fantastic, and the overall theme is well integrated. Still, I was bored for the first half of the game, averaging about two actions per turn, while it seemed everyone else was doing something extra, with maybe an extra turn or two more each turn. It has something to do with proximity to the the players, as building next to neighbors gives them a benefit in bumping up "power". It seems that players that correctly and quickly exploit their racial abilities, as well as exploit tactical position, will do very well. Duh. However, there is really no player conflict, except for the race to strategic/tactical choke points.

There was a feeling of dissatisfaction, given that there was substantial downtime between turns (it was for two of us our first play, and one player has a bad case of AP). When it was my turn, there was a very limited sense of possible actions, and the choice seemed trivial. Then it was another 10 minutes waiting for it to come around. The game seemed to pick up pace later, when the power pool afforded some extra actions and the economic engine kicked in, but this is typical of Euro games. Am I burning out of resource-collection Euros? It is a well-polished, well-developed game, and yet... it really doesn't grab me.

Initial rating is a "7", with limited room to go up with repeated plays. This is not one of those titles I am excited about running out and getting anytime soon. I'll be happy to play my friends' copies, if they are available.

(05/18/13) Update, 3 Plays.

After two three-player games, I'm beginning to like this game. With equally matched players, the game's last rounds tends to be a nail-biting affair of cat-and-mouse. Players need to keep their options open as long as possible, in order to respond to others, which means maintaining a stream of incoming resources. Some races are easier and fun to play, while others are more difficult, and may result in an unsatisfactory experience. I won with the Swarmlings in the second game, but barely lost with the Mermaids in the third game. Each game feels different, based on whether you manage to place your initial dwellings next to neighbors or not. If developing a city by yourself, the market upgrade cost alone will be prohibitive--you need to be next to neighbors! The second game was exciting, with lots to do, due to the race's starting conditions and proximity to neighbors. The third game was boring, like the first, where I was trying to build by myself. So, initial placement is very important, just like in Settlers.

I'll raise this to an "8". While it is enjoyable, still not excited enough to get my own copy.

(05/19/13) Update, 5 plays.

Okay, I admit it. I like this game. We had two five-player games that went rather smoothly, with little downtime. By this point, all but one had played the game several times in the past few days. However, there seem to be serious play-balance issues with the various races, or it could be that we haven't fully figured out how to play each race optimally. If you choose a poor race, it could be a lopsided and boring 2.5 hours. If you choose a good race, and the initial placement of dwellings are favorable, you're going to have a good time. Swarmlings, Halflings, Witches, and Nomads seem to do very well. Giants, Fierkers, Engineers, and Mermaids seem to do poorly. There is plenty of interaction, in terms of first-come/first-served for the action spaces, and a frantic race up the cult tracks, along with occasional surprises on the map board. Still, not going to get this, yet.

I can appreciate why people like it, but definitely not for me.

Overwhelming amount of little mechanics all over the place. Despite the 'point-salad' quality, I still felt too restricted and, too often, things would come grinding to a halt. I'm sure extra plays would iron out tactical/strategic fluff-ups, but there are too many little frustrations with too long a playtime for me to want to endure in that regard.

There is some sort of thematic tie-ins with the races but it's dead on arrival. Different terrain preference, an extra point here, an extra bit there; dry and dull.

There has rarely been a big game that has taken my interest with such force as Terry Mystica. I simply love how the game comes together - some indirect and direct confrontation with the locations on the board. Needing to always follow a slightly different strategy based on the bonus points for each round and based on the tribe. Quite a lot of rules coming together here but as smoothly as I have not seen it done in other big games in past years. An excellent game that I am currently always willing to play, regardless of the other really excellent titles that were also released in Essen 2012.

Dry at 2 players. It should even be an option on the box. Haven't played with more. 

Original Score: 7.5
Updated Score: 7.75

I feel like first-game experiences fall into three categories: First, there are games that you understand well by the end of the game and could get a handle on the viable strategies available. Then, there are games where you still only kind of know what's going on at the end of the game, but you're willing to play a bit more to start understanding strategy. Finally, there are games that are so hard to understand you don't even know what you don't know. 

I think Terra Mystica falls into the last category. That doesn't make it a bad game, it just makes it one that I need to try more.

Here is a game with so many complex mechanics (spell-casting especially) that it should be crushed under it's own weight. Instead the mechanics and rules add so much depth due to the trade-off with each move. There are so many good moves but too little time to explore them all. Plenty of good options but which is best? The bonus tiles further add layers of scoring variety that changes how each game is played. Helluva brain burner but incredibly satisfying.

The player boards are so elegant. They contain so much information and give each race many different powers without relying on a wall of text / cards / tokens. A well designed product with plenty of game in the box.

Gameplay is incredibly sensitive to AP players. Very annoying to wait 15 minutes to have your turn in a round. You may have more turns and 6 rounds. It took two and a half ours to play with four players, and there was only one who thought too much. Imagine it with more APs! Uhh.
That makes me a "never ever again" game, however the game itself in other ways is good.

I'm very glad I got to play this before buying it.  I can't exactly say what I didn't like about it but I think it's some combo of the convoluted actions, abstract feel and unhelpful theme.

Terra Mystica is a highly strategic game with some unique mechanics and multiple paths to victory, which offers a unique experience for multiple play-throughs thanks to its diverse cast of empires.  Balancing was a slight problem with the game when it comes to races, but didn't ruin the experience for anyone in our group.  Would love to play again.

First game, had a hard time remembering that "when a group of 4 directly adjacent structures have a power level of 7, a town is automatically founded." Thankfully we never remembered too late for it to really affect anything.
Overall, the rules made sense from the rule book. Thank goodness for first game layouts; would have been a bit overwhelmed trying to figure out where to place as it was virtually everyone's first game.

Look forward to playing again, seeing how other factions work.

Rating may bump up on subsequent plays based on how long plays take with more players or how bad the AP is on the average game.

This is a good example of why my interest in Euros is steadily in decline. Essentially it's just the usual fare of converting resources between types and then converting to VP as efficiently as possible. What's different with more recent Euros is the complexity, here there are 3 types of currency: cash, cubes and 'power' and multiple races that all have their own specialisations. All of which makes this a very hard game to 'get' and I won't be doing so as, for me, the effort involved in getting to grips with the system far outweighs the rewards on offer. A competent game, but not appealing for my taste.

RATING: 9
After three plays, I feel like I am starting to get a handle on this one.  The secret is that the tech track is shorter than it looks, and it's possible to get ambitious earlier than one might assume. There are a ton of things going on in this game, many having to do with the tradeoff between playing for the turn bonuses, which are pretty significant, and playing to keep up with your own plans, which you'll need. If you can afford to do both these things, you've set up your economy better than I've ever been able to do! It's got variable player powers which can be quite significant but which seem fairly balanced (though not 100% sure about this yet), some jockeying for board position, a little tech track, and an interesting economy based on what you have out on the board at that moment.  It still feels fairly tactical--a lot depends on accomplishing what you want in that specific turn--and yet, each turn is wholly dependent on the one before. Would love to have more opportunities to play this.

RATING: 9.1
Refrito 2.0 de mecánicas que hemos visto en otros sitios que me ha gustado. Llevar una raza (en plan Smallworld) cuya misión es terraformar el tablero para hacerlo más habitable para si misma (los hobbits viven mejor en colinas que en cualquier otro lugar, los nómadas en el desierto...) y en ese terreno construir sus edificios  unidos en plan Power Grid. Las construcciones (en plan Puerto Rico) permitirán obtener recursos (a saber: poder, palas, sacerdotes, monedas...) como en cualquier juego de gestión de recursos y mejorar las habilidades especiales indicadas en el tablero personal de cada raza (en plan Goa o Hansa Teutónica). Además hay habilidades que se pueden escoger por turno y si no las escoges, para incentivar su elección en el siguiente, se las premia poniendo una moneda sobre ellas... (en plan Puerto Rico) Lo dicho: un refrito. 

Pero el caso es que no me ha parecido malo: hay mucha rejugabilidad porque hay 14 razas distintas que comienzan en el tablero de una manera distinta cada vez. PROS: absolutamente todo (acciones, precios, conversiones, árbol de tecnologías de tu civilización, poderes especiales, recursos iniciales...) está en el tablero, lo que facilita su digestión, y además es útil porque el juego es complejo, para jugones del nucleo duro que no olviden detalles importantes. Cierta interacción, para bloquear al contrario o todo lo contrario: para querer estar junto a él, porque los edificios que él construye pueden darte un recurso ("poder"). CONS Los 60€ que vale, la curva de aprendizaje que es elevada, y que es un refrito abstracto -¿Convertir pantanos en desiertos? - y muy, muy, muy euro. 

Le doy un 7 tras una primera partida con los gigantes en Runa a la espera que baje su precio. 

Sube en OCT 2013 a 9 tras la segunda partida

[ENG]

Nothing new here. It combines different mechanisms from another games I like. You manage a race like in Smallworld (hobbits, sirens...) whose mission is terraform the board in order to make it more habitable (the hobbits live in hills, the nomads in the desert...) and they constuct the buildings on this kind of terrain. The buildings can connect with each other, like in Power Grid and you can obtain resources (spades, magic power, priests, coins...) from them like in Puerto Rico and to increase your skills tracked on your personal board (like Goa o Hansa Teutonica). Further, there are more abilities that you can choose in a turn and if you don´t choose it, they will have a coin over them in order to be more attractive in the next turn.

But the fact is that I like it. There is a lot of replayability becouse there are 14 different races and they begin on a different place in every game. PROS: absolutely all the game concepts (actions, prices, conversions, technologies tree of your civilization, special powers, initial goods...) are on the board, so it´s easy to play a game, and very usefull too! Despite this, the game is quite complicated ("hardcore gamer´s game"). There is a kind of interaction becouse you can block to another player or you can do the opposite: to build near of him/her buildings in order to obtain "power" ( a resource). CONS: Expensive. Learning curve. Nothing new here. Are you transforming swamps into deserts? That´s a bit weird. Isn´t it?

Gestionale tedesco che riesce ad amalgamare, in modo assolutamente efficace, una serie di meccaniche note, come la classica espansione territoriale, con altre decisamente originali.

So, the new #2 in all its glory.  "Gamer's game," "hardcore Euro," etc. etc.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing Terra Mystica, and I would gladly play it again.  There's some interesting wrinkles to the gameplay (I was a little skeptical about the whole "cycling power" thing, which seemed a little contrived, but it does provide a nice safety valve to accomplish things you really need to get done while not being too much of a gimme) and those wooden pieces do feel oh-so-nice.  But my main issue with Terra Mystica is the same issue I had with Tzolk'in (the other new hotness from 2012)...what exactly is it that I'm doing here?  The random point generators for each round, from which derives the majority of the "replayability," are just that - point generators.  You get points for doing such-and-such because...that's what the tile says.  It's surprising to me that in a game about expanding your civilization, buildings themselves have no inherent value (apart from getting a lot of them connected, but the 1st-2nd-3rd point values make the delta for that awfully small).  It becomes another puzzle game (granted, a very good one), which is fine if that's your thing but just isn't very high up on my preferences.  

One final note: this game gets major demerits for the "cult track" (another aspect it shares with Tzolk'in), which is just incredibly lazy game design.

RATING: 6
It may provide very satisfying decisions, but which is building on a very cumbersome and abstract rule-set.

For a heavy game like this, I need the rules to be highly thematic based(comparing [designer=10][/designer] titles). TM becomes a too mathematical puzzle with huge downtime that squeezes out the potential fun. It's not bad, but just not a game I will enjoy. The flaws prevent me from exploring the fun provided.

It's not bad to have one as a collection, but it is not going to hit table frequently enough to justify the price.

RATING: 7
Interaction: 5 out of 10 (perceived)
Theoretically, there is a good deal of (indirect) play interaction. Players compete for the actions to be purchased with magic. Players try to control the area and limit expansion opportunities of each other, to be highest on cult tracks, and to have the biggest connected area at the end of the game.

So Terra Mystica is more interactive than many heavy eurogames. Most of the interaction is indirect. Thus, king-making is mostly avoided. The downside is that players silently ponder over their moves. At least in our rounds there was hardly any communication going on. After all the game doesn’t feel very interactive.

Fun: 6 out of 10
The challenge to find the optimal moves is fun. The missing direct interaction and the weak thematic implementation prevent the game from being more fun, though. Bonus tiles are put randomly so each game is a bit different. On the other hand it makes the game feel like maximization of points. For instance is the last one or two rounds, it can be better not to build any building if there is no bonus tile that awards points for doing so becauses also give a few points at the end of the game. Most of the time players do their math to check which combination of building they can afford to buy with their current resources. Personally I prefer to play the non-official AI implementation online. It takes much less time and I can try out some weaker factions so I really need to give my best to beat the AI.

Replayability: 10 out of 10
The game mostly uses common mechanics. The most innovative mechanic are the magic balls. It has little impact on the game experience, though.

The replayability is extremely high, with about 14 differenct factions and random bonus tile setups no two games are the same. The factions are not really balanced. Some factions are considerably stronger than others. Of course this can also be quite handy as weaker or less experienced players can get a handicap by getting a strong faction. Here you can find detailed stats about how often which faction wins: terra.snellmann.net/stats/

In the long-term I hope that the factions will be balanced by adjusting the amount of resources or power that they get in the beginning of a game. Alternatively, there could be an auction with power for the factions.

Comments:

Still not sure about this one. I enjoy playing it, but it is both punitive and pretty opaque. I also can't shake the feeling that it top loads far too much of the relevant decisions into the opening of the game. If you do badly on picking a race, picking a starting location, or just have someone who counter-picks either of those against you, you will have a rough time.

I'm considering an attempt at playing the game with some sort of auction for races, or possibly a swap rule after opening race choice and city placement. I'd like to think it through a bit and then try out different options. Right now, I'm still okay with playing it, but I'm not the biggest fan.

No sleeves required.

Still factions are really unbalanced. Although this can be an advantage, if experienced players take weaker factions to give powerful ones to newcomers.

Terra Mystica makes a sprawl of mechanics somehow tie together, and then it takes area-control and somehow makes it beneficial to intertwine with other player's pieces. Really cool how it does that. That the game relies on something other than worker placement and still feel so "euro" is also something I appreciate.

I LOVE that it's perfect information.

A city building game through the mechanic of variable character abilities. The game provides various tactics and lots of fun by planning city building. The aspect of game is dynamically diversified by the power of mutiple tribal characters. Every tribe has unique skills or privileges. Enjoyment of the game is originated from maximizing tribal strength. Like a double edged sword, however, it provokes the breakdown of game balance. Each races has its best tactics. Racial advantages are usually achieved by the best tactics and the ideal moves or choices. Because of the ideal moves for each races, players always pursuit the optimum strategy. Once played every tribal characters, the game is changed very tedious. Players repeat the suitable tactic methods again and again by which tribe the players choose. A so-called tactical standardization happens very often. This is one of the most serious problems on Terra Mystica. Except the tribal tactical standardization problem, Terra Mystica is still a very nice strategy game. It provides a lot of fun for those players who didn't find the optimum moves yet.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

While the size of the map may indicate it would hold a lot more strategic depth with more players, it does play splendidly with 2. I have found myself enjoying the game more and more as I realize the massive difference a chosen race has on the game-play. The tactical nature of how you time your racial traits versus the strategical need for geographically supremacy blends to make a very tight and deep experience. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- A deep brain-burn in around an hour for 2 players.
- While the variables for each race may seem small, they have a huge impact on the game-play.
- A massive amount of replay that you want to come back and experience, as every game is a new puzzle to solve.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- 5 to 10 minute setup time, even with Plano boxes. 
- You often find yourself one resource away from a great move which may infuriate some.

7 - volgens ratingssuggestie van BGG. 
Kan nog stijgen, want herinner me de details van het spel niet meer wegens al 4+ jaar niet meer gespeeld. 
Herinner me wel dat ik het een fijn spel vond, maar beheerste het niet helemaal. Wel plezier gehad bij het spelen en Rafaëls versie ooit meegepakt naar Wilfried voor een 2p-game. 
01/2018: moet dus dringend nog eens op tafel komen.

Ça doit faire deux parties que je joue commence à prendre le tour des actions bon jeu à deux mais 4 quand on commence à être proche il doit y avoir plus d'interraction mais vu qu'il y a beaucoup de choses à faire souvent les gens hésite.  Je pense qu'après la troisième partie je vais commencer à prendre le tour.  Un jeu que je ne laisserai pas aller surtout avec l'extension j'ai hâte d'essayer les autres peuples.

This game is ludicrous complicated, which usually means a pretty low rating for me, but this one piqued my interest more than most. It might just be the colorful presentation and fantasy theme, but also a degree of interaction that is higher than usual for this kind of engine-building game. I still wish it was less complicated, though, and I'll never own it because I would never want to teach it.

I won't play this with more than 4 people, EVER AGAIN.  It is too long with 4 people honestly.  I could have played 4 games in the 3.5 hours it took to play with 5 and the 1 hour setup/takedown.

BLEH.  Just because it is a decent game does not make it top 5 material.  Sorry BGG community, you are just wrong on this.

I tried to avoid the hype, but ultimately gave in and gave Terra Mystica a shot. And I'm hugely glad I did.

Outstanding Euro game that manages quite a bit of interactivity between players, without introducing a lot of screwage. Since moves typically take a turn or two to set up, it's pretty easy to string short term plans together and avoid their disruption. Long term strategy, however, takes work (the good kind).

Initial race selection perhaps figures a bit too strongly in the end result, but otherwise, this is good stuff.

Probably my favorite game. I love the player interaction in this (I completely disagree this is solitaire) as it is subtle but always present. Every action you make effects the players around you. Extremely cool and manipulable power system. Love the different race powers leading to extremely different play styles. Another major boon is the player who plays the best wins. Almost no luck or kingmaking

Very dry, heavy optimization game.
Very similar to Hansa Teutonica (development tracks, placing tokens/building on the board to get profits etc.), but more complex and twice as long.
I like heavy optimization games, but this one (just as Hansa Teutonica) is not really my style...

Varied races are nice idea, but not enough to maintain my interest in the game. And some of them are really not that different...

An amazingly well designed Euro. No random factors, all information is available to you. A plethora of choices to make at any time during gameplay. Playing Terra Mystica is like watching a multitude of cogs run. Every piece of the game's design, big and small, all work in unison to contribute to a well oiled machine.

RATING: 8
Its your typical well thought out Euro game with good depth, lots of ways to score, no luck, too many things to do with not enough actions, mostly nothing new and completely void of theme (also thought the 'name' was cheesy). 

I almost thought there were TOO many things to 'track', but I am out of the swing of things for Euro's these days (read burnt out on them so rating could be a tad low) so take that comment FWIW, and I've only played once (but I would expect most people's first game to feel this way there is just much going on). I wonder if the chain bonus was given just a touch too much weight 

Would NOT want to play with 5 (not horrible just don't see the 5th adding anything for the extra length), 4 was good and probably best, 2 or 3 won't be competitive enough without changes (3 might be fine if enough scoring changes were implemented like on the 'medici scoring track' not sure on that, but not as good as 4 either way  as other things like certain actions will be just tighter and since there is no real chaos anywhere, 4 is it imho).

Bokkensprong Novelty Night 20/09/13, met Joris, Jelle Raes (Chiro), Sander (rechten), Gunther (Zwijndrecht) en ik (gewonnen met Heksen, 86? punten). Spelregels waren zware dobber; spel is zwaar maar echt tof.
Spel in zes ronden; elke ronde leveren specifieke acties extra punten op. Elke speler speelt met een volk (Heksen, halflingen, reuzen, meerminnen,...), bouwt zeshoekige landtegels om naar zijn eigen habitat (vb. bos voor heksen), en bouwt er vervolgens gebouwen op (huizen, handelshuizen,... tempel, fort). Buren kunnen meeprofiteren via paarse acties (die mogelijk wel punten kosten; zijn dat meestal zeker wel waard). Geld, arbeiders en priesters zijn nodig om landtegels "om te spitten" of gebouwen te bouwen. Grote steden (minstens 4 gebouwen, 7 punten waarde) leveren sleutels op (=punten, toegang tot hoogste tempelplaatsen, en extra voordeel).
Spel wordt beter na meerdere keren spelen.

RATING: 8.5
Really solid game, the races all feel distinct and for the most part really powerful, and there's really a high degree of planning that comes in since the round scoring tiles and the round bonus tiles are all chosen at the beginning of the game and will have a huge impact on how the game develops. And the power system is really clever, knowing how much it makes sense to burn to get to a quick cycle time but without wasting any power generation is important. And of course the interaction is very important, you're really incentivised to build near each other to leach power and to make trading houses cheaper, but you also want to have room to grow and expand since the more buildings you have on the board the more income you get and the better you'll do on the end game largest territory scoring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Excellent eurogame with the add-on of being able of pick a different way to play (races) in each game.

Things I like:

- No luck, no hidden information. You can (and you should if you want to win) think your strategy from the very set-up, including your race choice.
- 14 different races allow for different ways to play the game. 
- Variable set-up (replayability)
- Power mechanism is great 
- No screwing interaction, but you should be aware of what other players want to do (and which race they are)

Things I don't like:

- My main gaming-friends don't like it as much as I do

RATING: 9
A new favorite!  Each  player has a different fantasy race with different abilities.  Each one is trying to gain maximal points by obtaining resources (workers, money, priests) and using them to build and upgrade buildings, terraform terrain to their home type to allow for buildings, and progression on the elemental cult tracks.  Every turn is full of agonizing wonderful choices and alternate strategies.  You really have to watch what everyone is doing.  Not much downtime as each player take an action at a time.  At the same time, a relatively short game with only six turns.  During income phase, I find it helpful to place a marker on each income source as I use it, to make sure I don't get confused about what income I've already taken in.  I think some of the races are better than others so the race bonuses were not as well balanced but perhaps I just think so because I haven't played enough.  The components are really nice.  The only downside is that it is relatively expensive.

RATING: 6
Terra Mystica features many familiar Euro game mechanics with a few small twists. It manages great replayability thanks to a variety of races with unique powers. Unfortunately, this is a long game that starts full of possibility but quickly becomes less interesting as strategic options often decrease as the game continues. This not only makes it easy to fall out of contention before game's end, but it also makes the experience feel less epic than other games of its duration and depth. It's a solid game, but not one that warrants the time to play and master.

== Long Version

Heavy euro VP race with an opaque mesh of currencies and variable player powers. Gold, workers, priests, and power all act as currencies that are frequently exchanged and spent as players attempt to grow their towns across the map. A key mechanism here is that each player will only be able to place new buildings on their unique type of land, but there is the ability to transform land which morphs the board to your favor. 

The gameplay is heavily slanted toward optimization and efficiency. There is a bit of leeching off of others, and chances to cut people off on the board, but direct confrontation is absent. There is no way to destroy anything that another player has already built. Many points are scored during the game, with their relative efficiency changing each turn. However, once the board is set up there is zero randomness involved, so players may study the current setup before beginning to play.

It's a huge puzzle in the best sense of that term for euro games. Given an initial board setup, there are 14 factions to choose from. Each will perform differently for a given order of in-game scoring efficiencies and available bonuses. Choose wisely and react to your opponents' choices.

Endgame scoring revolves around two major sources:

1. "Longest road" -- It's not called that, but that's really what you're doing. It's big tub of points here.

2. Four tracks representing elemental cults which act as horse races for players to jockey on over the course of the game. You score nothing on these tracks during the game, but you can see where everyone is, what points they will be scoring at the end, and then choose to spend your resources accordingly.


Gameplay could drag with super-AP-prone players, but the turns *should* be short. The individual actions are small and self-contained, so the action should move around the table quickly. The problem for someone suffering from AP is that there's a level of fog over the game where it's probably impossible to calculate exactly what you should be doing, but it seems like you can, so people are going to try. The fog comes from not knowing what bonuses other players will snag from your or what lands they are planning to transform. Again, there's no direct conflict, but these decisions can change your calculations dramatically. Once the game is underway, it's mostly tactical. Your overriding strategy stems from your faction choice and initial placements and isn't going to change much without grinding your economy to a halt.

There's definitely a snowball engine here, but it's not of the crazy run-away variety. Upgrades to buildings are tempered by the removal of the ability that the old building was provided. Your economy (should) improve over time, but it's gradual.



== Short Version

I definitely like this game. Economic snowballs, variable player techs, efficiency optimization, and a light fantasy theme are right up my alley. The combination of these is well done. The rules are fairly well written, and despite the moderate volume of rules it's not hard at all to memorize everything. With very few exceptions everything works as you'd expect and is internally consistent. 

I buy very few new titles each year, preferring older games mainly. I've also not been excited about many newer heavy euros in years. I have no buyers remorse at all with TM. This is a solid addition to the collection.

A fantastic heady Euro with, what I believe is, great theming.  I love the variety.  I also love that it is imbalanced (so that serious players and newbies to the game can have a great and semi-competitive time!)

Very nice. Well designed, very playable, good quality components.

It's a bit dry and impersonal, in my opinion. It seems that there's a tradeoff in game design: You can forego all that flavor text that needs to be translated and use symbols only (Terra Mystica, Race for the Galaxy), but you end up with a game that lacks some flavor. Or use lots of text to add flavor (Arkham Horror, Magic the Gathering), but then you need to have all that text translated.

RATING: 7.8
Like most of the best games I like the only randomness (apart from what the players themselves do) is in the setup...

... though there are known issues with faction imbalances from making this as great as Puerto Rico, Power Grid, etc.  Regardless it is still a blast to play with now 20 factions and extra end game scoring (using the expansion) there is a lot of replay-ability still.

It does take a fair amount of time to explain the rules to new players and 1st time players in a game can make this take a while to play... but w/experienced players some of us have been able to crank out a 3 player game in 90 minutes, a 4 (sometimes 5) in just 2 hours.

"Busy work" euro with many ways to score points: Get A to get B to get C and get D. Maybe next turn, you do B, C, D to get...F. Maybe you get E on the next turn. Monotonous with no life to it. Theme seemed pointless. Only conflict with other players is on the scoring side board, terraforming (fight for hexes to build on) and racing for the on board power bonuses. None of which are meaningful if you are looking for competitive play. Yet, I don't see this game as being a solitaire min-maxer type of thing, either.

The game is way too long and the last 10 minutes devolved into priest jockeying on the side board. Every player seemed to have or get 2-4 priests in the final round. Putting a priest on a track was countered by someone else making the same move to keep pace with you or the others. At the end of it all, there was no significant change on the leader board. It was an exercise in futility in trying to guess and outguess the other players on where you were going to place your priests. 

The only thing "Mystical" about this game is the fact that so many people are enthralled with this and it is a top 10 game on BGG.

As I have heard a lot of good things about Terra Mystica, I was expecting a great GREAT game but I was a bit disappointed :S. Terra Mystica is a good game, but as I had huge expectations I didn’t enjoy my first game very much. Still the jury is still out on this one.

On the good side, Terra Mystica is a medium-heavy gamer´s game with a very low luck factor, the game components are great and the races seem to be very balanced. The game is pretty meaty and offers a lot to think about, you have many options and CAN plan long term as the bonus tiles and all VP generators are known to all since the beginning of the game. It has many rules but they are simple enough and straightforward, however the gameplay is very deep and complex with lots of meaningful/hard decisions. The game components are very nice too and the art is adequate. Pure Euro, with a steep learning curve.

On the bad side, the down time can be excessive with 5 players, I would like to play with 4 players or less. Also I don’t feel any theme when I play Terra Mystica. 

This definitively has the potential to go up in my personal ratings, for now I want to play again soon (but never again with 5 players). I still have a lot to explore in the world of Terra Mystica.

I really like Terra Mystica, I will (most likely) buy it.

For now the weakest race IMO are the Cultists as their power derives from other races and for most of the game most player don’t take power from the cultists. The most powerful IMO are the nomads. The desert storm is very powerful. I have yet to play with lots of races.

Terra Mystica has won me over. It is a GREAT game indeed and I always want to play it. Fortunately I found a regular game group for it as many friends dislike it (too dry they say). I will buy it soon.

I love the Chaos Magicians, I feel they are very powerful. The player who play the Engineers always loses the game :devil: they are hard to play well. I have many more races to explore.

After many more plays, my desire to play Terra Mystica has taken a plunge. I’m not sure why because the game still delivers. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating.

I still haven’t bought it, but it is on my list of “must have”. The reason I haven’t bought it, is that many friends have it, so I always can play it if the mood strikes.

In my last game, we played only with two players and it was very fun and fast. When you play this way, the game´s strategy changes radically, a very positive thing in my book.

The quote from our game that sums up the whole thing..."as long as you aren't mean to anyone".  Typical passive-aggressive, non-interactive drek.  Scoring is a point-salad race but supposed "innovative" aspects are dull and insipid.  Played once. Never again.

My score reflects the design of the game not my willingness to play again.  I would much rather talk and drink a beer while others play than play it again myself.

One of best out there.  Creative resource, city building, and tableau management game. Lots to think about and the variable powers of each race is really where the game shines. Who doesn't want to play with them all and try out different special powers. This is a game I always come back to want to take down from the shelf. As for cons - the power token system is a bit fiddly and not thematic, and for a 2 player game to be fun some material modifications must be made to the end game scoring and god tracks. However, these are minor criticism for a top-notch game.

So far Terra Mystica is my favorite game of the 2012 Essen releases.

Terra Mystica is highly replayable due to its 14 different factions, not to mention the different combinations of favor cards and round bonuses that can occur.  What differentiates Terra Mystica from other such combinatorically replayable games (like Agricola for example) is that the most significant difference, the faction identity, imposes asymmetry on the players.  Sometimes these faction-specific abilities are radically asymmetric and require widely divergent strategies of the players.  Each faction has its own unique flavor which minimally makes me want to play the game 14 times.

My lone concern about Terra Mystica, and the single item holding it back from a 10 rating for the moment, is whether I'll eventually get tired of all the VP-grubbing.  To its credit Terra Mystica presents a highly engaging framework for its pointmongering, and very interesting point-for-benefit tradeoffs.  Under the hood though, it's still a game of incremental VP gains with large majority bonuses at the end - not very dissimilar in structure to many Eurogames in existence already.

Still, Terra Mystica is highly interactive (if often indirectly so) and yet provides significant individual control over civilization direction.  This is what others might call a "multiplayer solitaire" component but I want to avoid the pejorative as I don't mind non-interactive segments of a game.

I've been thinking about this game constantly since my last play, can't wait for a US release, and wish I'd had the foresight to import from Europe.

12/27/2012:  PBF is helping me really get this game.  I may need to raise it to 10 now that I'm understanding it a little better.

2/3/2013:  This is a 10.  While not necessarily "perfect" it has so many aspects I love about games - variable and asymmetric player powers, a tight snowball-ish engine, and brutal turf fights.  Once I hit 20 plays or so, I can see myself getting bored with the main victory tracks (+VP for trading posts, +VP for dwellings, etc) but the game as a whole probably has at least 30 plays before I'll want to move on.  That puts it in with games like Le Havre and Scepter of Zavandor among my 10s.

2/21/2013: I've been involved in a few really vicious first-turn turf fights.  Even though they're not necessarily crippling I have an emotional reaction to them.  I don't know where my rating will end up.  I'm going to play a few more times to find out.

4/4/2013: Back up to 10.

Gary's new favorite.  We play by randomly choosing which boards we use.  Really fun with 3 and 4.  My husband and I still really like it with 2, but I can see what people are talking about in regards to the map being too open for 2. We purposely build next to each other.

Love the asymmetric races. Makes you want to play them all. And it's great with all player counts (except 2). With 3you're trying to cosy up to your neighbours to get discounts and resources. But with 5 you're struggling for room trying not to get trapped. Probably my favourite game.

Edit: Play the app kind of exhausted me a little. It's a great app but it stops me wanting to bring it to the table. I've not played it in a while so I'm not playing the app with the hope it'll make me want to play the board game more.

Purchased January 2016. I was finally able to play for the first time, after having reading and studying the rulebook, as well as watching a few YouTube playthrough videos; on January 3, 2017.
This is the single most game which I would love to play a lot more than I do. It took me long enough to be able to get it on the table to play it for the first time, although I had "test played" it myself.
In addition to my gaming group being composed of more lighter, Ameritrashey type of gamers as opposed to Eurogamers, I believe the complexity of all the little rules in this game contributes to it being seen as very intimidating.
However, if you can learn and get past (or reminded about, if need be) how to play the game, I find the actual gameplay to actually be simple and elegant. In addition, the game is so deep, there is so much to think about.
By the way, for those that were wondering the history of how I came aware of this game: I had purchased this game was because I had looked at the box and I had noticed that it had a board of colored hexes, as well as wooded pieces which looked identical to Catan. So I had actually originally bought the game on a whim that it was "Catan on steroids". As I have mentioned earlier, I have since looked into how to play the game.
I have not even scratched the surface with this game. It has such high replay value due to the 14 (+6 with the Fire & Ice expansion, which I have yet to acquire) different factions which all have different special abilities and therefore require different strategies, especially since which of the other factions are in the game could influence your strategy. For example, in a 3-player game, if one is playing the Witches (Forest/Green terrain), but the other players are playing the Swarmlings (Lake/Blue terrain) and the Engineers (Mountains/Grey terrain); then the player who is playing the Witches will want to terraform either of these terrains, not only because it would cost the Witches player less, as both of these terrains are only 1 spade away, but in addition, these are the terrains of both of the Witches player's competitors. Therefore, if the Witches player terraforms and builds on these spaces, he/she would be taking away expansion spaces from the competitors, which may possibly block them in.
That is just one aspect of this awesome game. You are essentially building your engine in order to use your resources in the most efficient manner possible to generate victory points (so unlike in Catan where economy = Victory points, that is not necessarily the case in this game). In the beginning of the game, resources are tight, so you will need the help of other aids, notably the bonus tiles, in order to supplement your income; and you may have to pass earlier during the first few rounds than you would like (that is, until you become more experienced with the game). However, hopefully you can eventually start accumulating sufficient resources.
Another thing which I like about this game is that it is a pure strategy game. You control every decision you make in this game (aside from the choices which your opponents may make which end up affecting you: for example, if one of your opponents terraforms and builds on a space you were going to build on; or if an opponent takes the power action you were planning on taking before you). You actually have to develop a strategy. However, the game does guide you on how to receive bonus victory points: the bonus tiles, some of the favor tiles, etc.)
I cannot wait until the next time I am able to play this again. Hopefully, I can convince some at my gaming club to at least give the game a try.

RATING: 9.5
Really like the shared map and building contention between players.  There's a neat Small World element where each race can have a significant impact on your strategy.

Building different buildings that provide resources and tweaking your play with Favor tiles or power actions is a nice wrinkle.

Everything about this game just works for me.  I enjoy the different races and the way they all feel different.  I enjoy the open information aspect and trying to figure out what everyone else is going to do and keeping your options open.

Quite disappointed in this title, especially for the expense.  It's completely unsuitable for 2 players but more than that it's complexity for the sake of complexity.

It definitely takes experience in this game to do well. I definitely would be interested in playing it again soon; it is deserving of multiple plays to give the game a chance to shine!

After another play, I can definitely see the appeal of the game. The weird thing about this one to me is the ways that the points are awarded (perhaps the thematic disconnect is my main beef with the game). Why should I get points for digging in round 4 but not in other rounds? Other games have this mechanism as well (the Crown's Requests in Madeira for example), but I find the thematic reason for those to be a bit more logical.

More plays = more love. Such a great game!

Complicated set up and instructions for what turns out to be a fairly simple and fluid play once it gets going. Victory points are awarded based on builds and final placement, but the manner in which you get to those final ones has to be determined early because there's only six rounds -- and if you don't get a quick launch, you're going to have a struggle to catch up later.

PLUS: variety of roles to approach the game, strategy-based
MINUS: rulebook isn't great, awards planning ahead over responsive strategy

Very solid Euro.  Not exciting but interesting enough to happily come back to again.  If you like your euro games then you should like this.  No great complaints except that the whole 'priest' tracks are really lame - its as if the developer decided that the game did not have enough 'agonising decisions' or 'multiple paths to victory' and so added these tracks which serve no real purpose.  Not too heavy but it is a little long.  Its a good design, well developed.  In fact, perhaps too well developed?  That's a weird thing to say, but sometimes little quirky things in games really make the difference.  This one really has had all the wrinkles ironed out.  Some would say its had its soul ironed out, but that is too strong.  It reminds me a lot of a combination of Eclipse and Kingdom Builder, but that may just be the graphic design.  Update: downtime is horrific. Just boredom for three hours. The priest tracks are really lame design.

I thought this was the best game ever initially. Now after four plays, I enjoy it but have some issues with it. I think the advanced setup adds variety, but can see the potential problem that you might be alone without a neighbor. So far each race seems fairly balanced which is an impressive feat. I have found playing the different races really adds to the replayability. You have to play to the optimum of each race which makes for a really different game each time. This is one of my favorite games of all time.

This gives players lots of room for creativity and tension.  Multiple forms of "currency" to manage: money, workers, power, and multiple competing places to apply them.  The game has a good arc as one moves from just getting a toehold on expansion, to clawing out to new areas and coalescing around towns.  Add to this variable incentives to do certain things at certain times - which may or may not mesh with what you WANTED to do, creates many opportunities for intriguing play.

20+ plays.

Incredible variety and asymmetry.  Different factions (some requiring different skill levels to play well) and bonus tiles lead to quick ramp to enjoyment (~2 games) but a ton of content to explore.

As would be expected, balance is not perfect (3-6 factions form a clear top tier, a few should only be selected in specific scenarios, and a few are significant underdogs).  This can be mitigated by auctions/handicaps, and making even most of the factions competitive is a feat.

The game is a brain-bender, a beauty to look at, and a lot of fun.

Terra Mystica is one of these games where you think and discuss about the game afterwards which is a promising sign. There are a few strategic musts depending on the race (e.g. getting the giant / nomad fortress asap)  but the tactics to get there and accompanying targets can differ. There are plenty possibilities each turn which is the strength of the game but contains the danger of serious AP. The 100 minutes mentioned on BGG can easily be doubled on first play with a higher player number. Player interaction is present in the indirect form of claiming something first which will match the taste of eurogamers. It's a heavy eurogame which might have appeal to other gamers as well for its depth and flavour of the different races.

The best game there is. The races add the theme to the game, and the mechanics have the best balance between helping out and blocking other players. The interaction is so nuanced. The pieces are amazing. The only thing that I could see them doing to increase the theme immersion is giving a name to each round bonus tile. I think that is where people feel that the game lacks theme. In my opinion it's just as thematic as Caverna.

Okay game, but far too much of the game is in the planning / placement and too little is in the rest of the game. Resources are exceptionally tight (thus requiring an early plan), and never ramp up. I want this to be an empire building game, but it isn't -- a few resources here and there which need to be carefully managed. Probably a great game for people who enjoy this style of game, but not my taste.

Pros - Infinitely replayable.  Sets the standard for widely asymmetrical factions while remaining incredibly balanced.  Every decision is important but options restricted by resource availability to limit AP.  Currently plays in 1 hour or less for 2-3 experienced players in my group.

Cons - The theme is practically nonexistent.  Steep learning curve where it is nearly impossible for a new player to beat an experienced one.  Adds a tactical element at 2-3 players that I enjoy but some others do not.

Conclusion - Outstanding.  I've played this 100+ times and this would still be my "one game on a desert island."

It's like Small World grew up and became a beautiful, charming, down-to-earth astrophysicist that you and your parents always wanted you to marry.

RATING: 10
A resource conversion cube pusher, but not at all your standard one. A very strong spatial component (with blocking as interaction) and strongly assymetric player positions from start to finish due to each player having different special powers and different terrain preferences.

I just love the asymmetric races. Played with 5, which felt just right, so can see how 6 might feel a bit cramped. First game felt like it went rather fast (under 2 hours with 5 newbies). I'd worry about the turn order mechanism, except that at least in this case the turn order didn't feel like it played a role all that often.

Note: this game has a lot of special powers and production bonuses that are clearly marked on the components, but that are also easy to forget. Luckily if you forget to use a special, you'll basically just be harming yourself.

The theme certainly doesn't help the game at all, especially by drawing a comparison with Small World. And the rules can be initially bulky to digest. But once you start playing, it all works and seems starts to make sense as you play. Though I'm not convinced that all the races are completely balanced in all situations, each one is interesting to play and the breadth of the potential mixes is impressive. If only this played a little faster I would be really excited to keep playing this. As it is, it's a little hard to get regular play. But I hope to dig a little deeper.

I understand the base game and I can see the appeal, but something just doesn't click for me. Its a perhaps a lack of theme, or the overwhelming number of mechanics that seem to be tacked on.

I guess I would liken it to a mix of Kingdom Builder and Eclipse. Theres a generic board whose only purpose is terrain, and theres a player board with buildings. Players get bonuses for building different buildings. I think the game could be lighter and more simplified. Right now, there are just too many parts jutting out.

A game, in which you want to do more, than it is possible. There is never enough time for everything. You must always plan, how many dwellings to build and how many of them to replace to trading house in order to have resources for actions on next turn. Another interesting mechanics is about grabbing land - you need to change it to the terrain, required by your race. However each race has its own required terrain and the price of change differs by race... There is many different rules, however player board presents them quite concisely and clearly. A good game of good quality.

Žaidimas, kuriame norisi padaryti daugiau, negu įmanoma. Viskam niekada neužtenka laiko. Nuolatos reikia planuoti, kiek namų statyti, kiek keisti į prekyvietes, kad kitu ėjimu turėtum su kuo veiksmus atlikti. Įdomus ir būdas užvaldyti žemes - pasikeisti į savo rasei reikalingą reljefą, o kiekvienai rasei jis skirtingas ir pakeitimai kainuoja skirtingai... Taisyklių tikrai nemažai, tačiau žaidėjo lenta visas jas pakankamai glaustai ir aiškiai pateikia, todėl netenka per daug skaitinėti taisyklių. Geras, kokybiškas žaidimas.

Edit: Rating adjusted up.  The best game I own so far.  I usually win so that helps :) Its the only game I can say that about. I just seem to have a good feeling about how to maximize myself in this game.  If I don't win I'm usually last and I just had a bad game, didn't get into the right groove.

Wow, ok... I did enjoy this to some extent but it seems awefully overloaded with mechanisms so that I wonder if the same experience couldn't have been achieved without it being so clunky. Also, Uwe Rosenberg wrote the rules which is something he is terrible at so there did not help at all in understanding what's going on. I'm going to keep this for the time being - maybe more plays make me more enthusiastic about it. This might just be one of those...

Catan has more theme, and makes more sense. This is a bag of unrelated mechanisms. People look at the roles and claim this game has a strong theme. But nothing else in the game makes sense in relation to them. Kingdom builder is this game without all the nonsense. Wear a wizard hat while playing it and you'll get all the fantasy "theme" contained here, while placing your houses on hexes.

Rules might feel a bit overwhelming, but that's because of one of the weakest game rule editing performances of 2012. The start of the game might also feel a bit overwhelming, but you soon grasp what you can do and the amount of possibilities is actually not that wide. There seems to be a high level of replayability and lots of different ways to aim for the victory. Mechanisms are interesting and mix well together, the spoons being possibly the only awkwardish concept. Especially fascinating is the constant need to be close to other players while at the same time trying to create your own space to grow. Feels a bit like a Feldian game, because points are coming from many directions all the time. Could drag towards the end.

RATING: 8
This is a game design of considerable skill. I'm impressed at how well it all comes together, despite the multitude of moving parts.

Some minor quibbles: I wish the various races were more evenly powered -- clearly, there are some that are much better than others (which is unfortunate). The theme of the game is so thin that it approaches Knizia-levels of theme thinness.

Overall a great game: tense, fun, satisfying. I've played all player counts and 3-4 is where it's at.

I love Terra Mystica, I love love love it. Out of all the games I own, I feel that it provides the most room for growth as a player—every round of Terra Mystica is an education in what works and what doesn't, in what could work with a bit more planning. It's a beautifully crafted set of mechanics with a beautiful board and wonderful tactility.

I have no real complaints, but if you pressed me on it, I would say that the bits of "lore" or "story" or "background" (using those terms loosely) in the manual are not terribly interesting, though there is an amusing joke about a certain race's ability to blend into their surroundings being used both when foes are present and when relatives are visiting.

A solo few rounds at this stage. Very excited to play.

Tentative rating (10) after a couple of rounds of a 3 player game -- can't wait to try again :)

Husband thinks this is fiddly (I agree, but still love it). Daughter likes it. Hope it gets some play....

Will have to try again at some point. I enjoy the puzzle. But it's a little incoherent. Don't like the static board. Or the tacked on cults.

When Terra Mystica was released I wasn't really interested in it since it's as Euro as it gets.

Several months later I had begun to appreciate Eurogames again, tried it and loved it.

It comes in a big box, filled to the lid with replay value. This game has darted up the ranks over the last to years for very good reasons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Terra Mystica throws at you five currencies, one set of faction-specific powers and bonuses per player, one set of city upgrade bonuses, one set of city completion bonuses, one set of composite round bonuses, one set of composite role bonuses, one set of standard actions, one set of limited access resource conversions, two types of efficiency upgrade investments, an income engine with spatial constraints, a generic resource conversion scheme, and five long-term majority goals. This barrage of gauges and options offers a lot to claim your attention but also feels constraining given the tactical goals of matching resource acquisition to expenditure in order to clear efficiency thresholds and collect as many conditional bonuses as possible. The game suffers to some degree from "count backwards from the end" syndrome, where you will be highly rewarded for taking the time to make sure you won't be missing 1 doodah as you mean to close a high-scoring chain of actions at the end of a turn or, critically, at the end of the game.

Random selections of bonuses and factions provide variation, but also leave you wondering what a "vanilla" game in mechanical terms would be like. As for flavour, there's some of it in the faction presentation and abilities, but overall the proceedings remain quite abstract and faceless. As an example, there is no attempt to explain the "roles" in flavour terms; they're just another layer in the resource acquisition and conversion machinery. The elemental cults give you points, magic and random bonuses, nobody knows why. Anyone who cares to ask becomes the first sacrifice.

(Note: VPs, not spades, are the fifth currency. Spades are actions.)

The only thing in witch it fails is to create a lot of direct interaction (but still you're going to curse people in a 5 players game). most races seems really balanced after 5 games (or, at least, every color has a potentially winning side, if you get the strategy). wonderful managing of power, a really impressive new mechanic to add a wildcard that fix tactical mistakes. can be played in 25 minutes per player even with a little AP. best 2012 title i tried, looking forward for the expansion

Very enjoyable. Rated a 8 Nov 2014. Edit: now that I've been playing it more frequently with some old friends online it has proved that it is not a simple design and is a mixture of flavours and calculation between ITYOTD and Chess - both 10's in my listings. Let's see if I can crack this. Rated a 9 Jan 2015 Edit: Feb 2016: I've been playing this in the online tournaments for the past year+ and this game just doesn't quit. So many permuntations. I love this one... Rerated to a 9.5 - It's earned it.

Very nice game of expanding your race's influence, worship crazy elemental cults and permanently weakening yourself in order to summon priests out of thin air.

It lives up to the hype.
Well, except for the heavy part. It's actually not as heavy as it's rep had me afraid it would be.

Also, I would have rated it a 9 but... it IS slightly too heavy for me to force others to play it with me. Why? Because non-interested parties would just tune out. And that's no fun to play against.

I've only played this once, so my rating here is tentative. If anything it will likely increase. I haven't had the opportunity to play this. When that changes I can see myself liking this game a great deal. There appears to be many avenues for playing this well, and the crux of the game involves adapting your strategy in response to the decisions of other players. That is a key element in the games I like most.

A current favorite and a game that lodges itself into my mind long after I put it away.  For a game with a lot of initial complexity and rules overhead, it plays remarkably smoothly once you're over that initial hurdle.  It can seem like a puzzle when you look at the initial board state and try and figure out the best faction to choose.  And although that's obviously a big part of the strategy, the best laid plans often go by the wayside once you get around to, you know, actually playing the game and interacting with your opponents.

Ah, there's that word, "interaction."  Even without any direct attacking, I find this game to be extremely interactive.  The fundamental and brilliant strategic crux of the game is that you need territory to expand, but you need to build next to your opponents so that you get building discounts (for trading posts) and resources (power income).  There are also 6 actions that can only be taken once per round first come first served.  There is the significant spatial element with jockeying over terrain types and buildings.  And finally there are the endgame scoring bonuses with players competing over largest connected territory and advancement on the cult tracks.

While the game is certainly not dripping with theme, it's there if you wanna look for it.  The faction-specific powers and abilities are all mainly thematic.  Religious buildings give you priests, which you can send to the cult tracks to increase your religious standing, etc.

Now with 14 different factions, there is no way that all of them are or even could be perfectly balanced.  But I see that as a trade off between balance and depth/replayability.  And boy is there a lot of depth and replayability.  There are people who practically play this as a lifestyle game.  That being said, given the rules overhead, and huge amount of asymmetry in the various factions, this may not be the best game for you if you'll only play it 4 or 5 times a year (or total).  But for those willing to sink their teeth in, and fans of heavy euro games in general, you are in for a treat.

Played twice.
Once with 2.  Once with 5.  Both left me a little unsatisfied for different reasons.  It's novel in that it is an asymmetrical euro but I am not sure that alone makes it great.  It's tight.  It is interactive.  It should eb great but the chaos created by other players makes the painful panning you must do sometimes moot.

The game is good.  I just don't think it is great.  For me, I bet the sweet spot is 3 players.

I would play again, but I won't seek it out, and I don't think I'll buy it.

The game has a high quality material and comes with 22 plastic bags big+
However after some time the game gets borring in my opinion since its always the same map you are playing. Another bad point in my opinion is the ending. Since you already count the points during play you almoast always know who will win this game leaving a real borring feeling at the end of the game. It feels like "Oh it endended I did not even recognise that..."

The price is too high for that game in my opinion. At least it is if you like some diversion in gameplay.

2015-03-21 - After one 3-player game it's an 8. I am not sure if it is the second best game in the world as BGG rank says, but I really like it. It's not as overwhelming for me as, for example, Tzolkin,  but there is still a lot to think about. I want to play it again. And - as always - variable race powers is a cool thing in every game. I really like the three pot magic system mechanism. 

2016-02-15 - 8->7 - We played several times, but not too often lately. It's good, but the theme is really pasted on here. We rarely suggest it as the rules need to be reminded before the game. Tzolkin, which I mentioned above, is really manageable after few plays.

2017-09-11 - 7->6 - I don't miss this game at all. I could play it, but I can list five to ten medium, medium-heavy euros I prefer. And those variable powers rather force you to play in certain way than give you more opportunities.

Heavy euro game with all open information and zero luck. Pure optimization to achieve the most points. The game has a lot of merits, specially the discovery of all the races. However, after that... The game drops too much for players with a non-competitive gamer mentality.

Really enjoy this at 3-4 players, was a bit slow at 5 but very tight (haven't tried 2 player yet). Actually surprisingly easy to teach because so much of the information is provided by the player board. Gameplay even with new players is pretty smooth after a couple of turns. I've introduced this successfully to player who always play Catan and they took to the game really quickly.

Only some people in my group enjoy this game so it doesn't hit the table too much, but when it does I really appreciate the tightness of the play and crucial decisions every turn. It's satisfying when you can pull off a big scoring combinations while scraping by with just enough resources. It's always so tight with resources that waiting for someone to give up the round bonus tile you need can be excruciating. Every decision matters and makes the game very tough and enjoyable.

I actually played Scythe before Terra Mystica, and only turned back to this coz it was apparently an influence on the designer.  And I can see why.  Scythe is maybe a tad more stream-lined/simplified: Terra Mystica is brain-burning.  If I'm going to play a meaty Euro, then I like it like this: spatial elements on the map (crucial for interactivity); engine/economy-building; both tactical & strategic planning.  Great stuff.

Active player now in several PBF and PBE games. This game is wonderful. Challenging, dynamic, strategic, tactical and a very fresh theme with assymetric race powers. This leads to great replayability.

Next update:
8 games in, I'm totally overwhelmed in a 100% positive kind of way.

Played it now quite evenly distributed with 3, 4 and 5 players. Rocks in any combination, plays different with any combination.

No me pareció tan complejo como apunta la BGG (3.93/5), siendo que no estoy acostumbrado a este tipo de juegos.

El juego en sí me gustó más de lo que me esperaba, pero me decepcionó un poco la temática, porque me esperaba un aspecto más místico, con referencias a la magia o incluso con magos, con poderes y demás, y no el típico terreno a lo Catán (que en este caso no creo que le pegue).

This is THE brain burner. I feel like I need to plan out the entire game at the first turn but then there are uncertainties caused by opponents screw up my plan. I think in terms of depth and complexity, this comes with nearly the same seriousness like Go game. Love this game.

A disappointment.  A pasted theme and a very dry game. This is no civ or fantasy game.

Only played once and unfortunately had to leave about 2/3 of the way through. After my short experience with the game I am really liking it and can't wait to play again AND finish a match. It seems like a lot to take in at first but once you play out a few turns it all comes together. It also seems like there is a lot of differences between all the races which will obviously add to the replay value.

A game about managing multiple currencies. There's some interaction thanks to the board, but it's mostly an economic game, with some snowballing issues. Not a huge fan of those, but I must admit this one is well designed. Would rate it considerably higher if its playtime was closer to 90 minutes: over two hours for this kind of game is a bit of an overkill for me.

Fantastic economic euro. Amazing depth of strategy without much AP. Beloved mechanics from other games (Puerto Rico, Go, Eclipse, Settlers) intertwine with new ideas to create a clockwork of head-scratching fun in a manageable play time. Lots of replayability through 14 different factions. Recommended for euro-lovers.

played a few times. Everything feels like a struggle, like work. Getting a citadel getting money, getting anywhere on the board, it takes too long, and i don't like the art work except the character cards. The only interaction is on the board and at getting the bonus cards. 
If I were forced to play it for a week straight I would perhaps like it in the end. So no.

Played my first game of this in 2017 and at time of first playing, this game is 5 years old which in the gaming industry is quite old, but it still feels fresh and new and its exactly what I feel a euro game should be. I play this two player with my wife with both players controlling two characters and then at final scoring only our lowest character counts, it forces you to balance the two players and not just piggy back of the one character and then sink the other. For our money it works absolutely amazing as a two player game.

This game is fantastic. My girlfriend and I both enjoy it. The almost complete lack of luck is great. Too many games have high luck, leaving little room for the players' skill to come into play. 

Unfortunately, due to there only being one side to the world map, this game loses a few points. Another map on the reverse side would have been nice, but instead it's just recycled art from the box/player boards. Dumb. 

My suggestion for the forthcoming expansion--add another map. Or try to providing alternate layouts in the rulebook--there are more than enough terrain tiles to reinvent the map--so play test some layouts and make them available.

I haven't even played this yet, but I'm so excited after reading the rules and watching some videos that I want to rate it preemptively.  I can see this one going to 10 if it's as fun and engaging as I think it'll be.

08-07-2013 - Got a solo game in playing 2 sides to get the gist.  It's a pretty good game.  I can see it shining quite brightly with 3 or more real people playing!  More to come...

10-07-2013 - I got kind of terra mystica'd out.  It's a good game, but not what I expect it to be, and it's hard enjoying it immensely for what it actually is.  At least for now, maybe that'll change.  Down to a 7.

RATING: 10
This is the best heavy Euro out there, period. It is replayable, but there is zero luck. The game is tight, you never feel like you can do all the things you need to ensure a victory. Every action seems like it is taking a step back and two steps forward, but everything is clearly laid out and the decisions are very dynamic. There isn't much direct interaction, but plenty of indirect interaction. What parts of the map you choose to let other players have can and will have an effect on the final score. The fantasy really comes across, the map is clear. Just wish it was easier to get to the table!

Well I finally acquired terra mystica and it quickly found its way to the table.

I knew there were different races. So I thought this would involve fighting. too few games with direct conflict. 
So I thought great... Well was I mistaken. this game is an engine building game (with some sort of worker placement as some actions can only be executed once in a round)

It played much quicker than I thought it would. And unlike Kohle and Kolonie that also has a few rounds of play we all had the feeling that we could accomplish something.

Another thing that is pretty amazing is that the game doesn't really take so long.
Awesome design!

Edit : second play took much longer because of my deliberate planning. It worked since I scored 111 points. Really like the decisions and the importance of these.
The power bowls make it stand out.
However despite the races it is dry as hell. I have no problem with that.

High expectations transformed to excitement after the first couple of plays of TM. Every play after that and I'm realizing that it's not as great for me as it seemed to be. It's not that I dislike it; I would gladly play it when brought to the table, however I would rather spend my time playing my other heavies.

The things I like about the game are a lot. Here's what I don't like much: 
-It's a struggle to get your economy going, and despite the game's length it ends right when I feel like I could start expanding more freely. Yet it does feel that it would drag for too long if it had extra turns
-Pasted on theme
-AP. Serious AP
-Setup time and rule explanation time

Complex, no random elements whatsoever, challenging.  This is a monster of a worker placement game.  Every step forward seems to put you two steps back, and when you fail to win, there is no random element to blame it on.  While I initially enjoyed the depth of play, the frustrating parts of game play are more noticeable to me now.  One never has enough resources to do what one wants to do.  This alone wouldn't be so bad, but when it's your fellow players who are depriving you of the necessary resources, it makes for a tense, head-to-head several hours of gameplay.

Played once with 4 players. The game was 80% downtime. I had to make a tough call twice or thrice during the game. There is no way to dig oneself back to contention if you screw / are screwed the early game. Mechanics are not intuitive, and to be honest, they are not very interesting either. Components are between shabby and average. Graphics are nice though. Game is chaotic and unpredictable.

I could be talked to try again with only three players. Won't be expecting much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of optimizing and micromanagement happening on a Eclipse-esque player board, building (for more income), land grabbing and blocking on the map. Some races are a lot trickier to play than others, and depending on what others are in the game, runaway leader/-loser situations are bound to happen, so I see the potential of it getting frustrating sometimes in a 2 hour game. Also the combination of race and the round bonuses can dictate your strategy somewhat. They can decide the outcome to some extent sometimes as well. But I still have this feeling that it probably offers more with repeated plays, need to play some more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
It didn't quite live up to my expectations. It's a good dry euro, but it didn't leave me wanting more. I'm just not a big fan of games where you constantly have to search for weird ways to get basic resources in order to get anything done. Still, I had a good time playing this and I certainly understand why it's highly rated. Also, the artwork is good and there are lots of quality components, such as thick player boards. 
NB! Rating based on 2 player game but according to BGG many people don't recommend this as a 2 player game.

I have played this a few times now but only 2 player. A very nice fantast themed resource management game where it is easy to step off course or be tempted to do the wrong action. There is plenty to do and to keep an eye on and Victory points are not always that easy to come by. It also works as a solitaire puzzle (this is my opinion not the publishers), but do not expect to be overly thrilled playing solo, its strength is in multiplayer mode. Sadly the rules let the game down a bit, the 15 pages of rule queries on this site alone indicates the lack of clarity and confusion caused by what at first appears to be a comprehensive rule book. That is not to say they are badly written it is more a matter of some parts are open for misinterpretation.
The game works smoothly with several strands running through it to make it engaging with plenty to think about, I highly recommend this game.

Terra Mystica is a game with very little luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.

A bit on the longish side, it's a bit reminiscent of LaCitta.  A bit more euro than other Civ type games but still with lots going on at all times.  Feels like a game with a long learning curve where you could improve quite a bit over time, but the repetitiveness doesn't really support that.  It's also unclear that everything is completely balanced, with all the differences and the "clockwise from start player" being sort of an X factor.  I think I'd rather play in the order players passed last round.  Not sure that would hit the table often enough to warrant the purchase.

It's some sort of civ development game where you only manage city growth.

My main complaint about this game is that there are a lot of resources to manage and the flow of these resources is very confusing. In fact, there are 9 resources: Worker, priest, gold, power, shovels, Culture(x4). 

There are so many things you can do and so many resources that you tend to forget what to I need to do to get a certain resource. So at some point, it just get confusing.

Learning curve is about 5 games, or 5 hours, more or less.
Great replayability, great fun with your friends, i suggest 4 or 5 players; 2 and 3 players the map feels too big.
Countless hours of fun

RATING: 6
This has a staggering amount of game bits and components and a big learning curve.  Also, I'm uncertain if all the factions are fairly/equivalently balanced and it's hard to say after only one play session.  It is definitely a blend of Euro-mechanisms, so if you like theme this is thin on that.

RATING: 8
Excellent euro game involving terraforming and unique powers to each of the 14 possible races making each game a bit unique.  The game reminds me a bit of Hansa Teutonica in that one clears off his/her board and builds on a map.  What is cleared off the board will score the income whether it be priests, money, workers, or special knowledge tile, etc.  Each race can only build on one type of ground and there is some benefit to building adjacent to each other to leach off power.  However, this can also lead to conflict over common lands both can terraform cheaply.  Power is another special currency in the game which allows you to take additional special actions.  I'm not a fan of the box shape/size, but have no other complaints.  There is no direct player competition and you cannot remove other players from their spaces or destroy their buildings.  There is sometimes tight competition for certain lands as mentioned earlier.  

I do think this game is best with 4-5 players due to the competition over hexes that results.  Working to complete the largest clump of buildings proves more challenging and planning too far ahead can prove more difficult since you don't know if the hex you want to terraform will still be available.  Playing with 2 or 3 would be too wide open in most cases for my preferences since you could likely plan everything out well ahead of time.

So this is a game. A game made up of mechanics and a setting that have absolutely nothing to do with each other other than the fact that one mechanic can influence the other. Its just a hodge-podge of mechanics all thrown into a blender to see what came out at the other end. It is functional, and is a game, but it surely wasn't anything remotely close to be fun for me. This is the poster child for the dying breed of Euro style point salad games that makes absolutely no sense other than to themselves. Components are okay, but the graphic design is horrendous. If I never play this game again I will be happy. Agricola is even better than this fun murdering game.

This is a great example of a game that lives up to its hype for me.  Meaty, meaty Euro that is neither completely opaque nor obvious even from the first play.  Has a playing time appropriate for its depth and feels tense throughout.  Will have to see how different races influence play and balance.

I started getting a feel for the game towards the end of the first game.

I like the quick individual actions.

Another euro: I see this game as yet another set of cogwheels (you turn the "action" wheel, you get something, you get the cog of this something along with another cog, you get something else, etc.—very different from, say, Magic: the Gathering). Not a bad one, but just another one, in a different style.

I am not a big fan of the fact that there are many ways to make points that it seems to be fine to just grab them anywhere as the opportunity arises: I don't feel the need to have a consistent strategy (something that Race for the Galaxy gives me), I mostly make efficient local choices. So, despite the fact that there is no obvious single strategy (so many moving pieces, so many little opportunities!), it feels like the choices are kind of always the same: many tactics, but kind of always the same. The path to victory seems more like a brownian motion: just push in the best direction for you, from about the samey set of options. Sure, no two paths will be the same, but choices look locally very similar each time.

I was relatively confused by the power bowls mechanic: I understood the rules, but did not especially enjoy playing with them.

I just decided to try to be quite efficient in anything I was doing: one gets points for many different things (goals, cults, and many little special things,…), so I mostly tried to maximize the local use of whatever action. At the end, the points were so close (except for the winner, maybe only due to a double counting of 18 action points) that a specific strategy indeed did not seem to matter so much…

There is no way of destroying the buildings of an opponent. We can mess up a little through terraforming places adjacent to the opponents, but that's not much.

The theme is quite absent: I did not feel like a Nomad at all, I could see one connection between the Mermaids and their special seafaring ability, I did not really see the theme behind the halflings, but I did not really pay attention to their special powers. I fell the theme less than in 7 Wonders, or Settlers of Catan…
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Personally might be the best game out there. The depth and a mere fact there's no random factor (no dice or card drawing), makes it a really great game. If you're going to complain about the lack of theme - dude, you've got to the wrong table, Imperial Assault and other ameritrash is being played there (pointing at the corner table full of dice).

Es ist und bleibt eines meiner Lieblingsspiele und so kompliziert isses gar nicht, warum kommt es nicht so oft auf den Tisch?
Ich fordere mehr Terra Mystica, mehr Auf den Spuren von Marco Polo, mehr Zolkin der Maya Kalender und mehr Russian Railroads. Ausserdem noch Suburbia, .............. :)

I tend to agree with Temelin [article #23867893] > Terra Mystica - Man did I think this game was going to be amazing. Turns out it's just a cluster#&$% of mechanics that make no sense together. This game has everything: Changing terrain tiles, neighbor bonuses, doo-wop groups, moving people down hallways, tweekers, skeevies, Spud Webb, shovels, moving disks around in bowls, hobo-cops, and bonuses for doing random $&!# in a certain order. This game is what would happen if Kingdom Builder, Small World, and Hansa Teutonica had a threesome on top of a Stefan Feld point salad. I hate this game so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Terra Mystica is a strategic game with a simple game principle, where luck plays a small role. You lead one of the fourteen peoples who try to change the terrain on the board to put down buildings. On the one hand it is not good if there are other players in the neighborhood, because this limits your expansion possibilities, on the other hand this can be advantageous because it can give you a number of advantages in the game. It is this tension that makes Terra Mystica a unique game, so you are on the edge of your chair right up to the end.
Buildings can be improved to get even more benefits in the form of workers, priests, money and strength. Build temples to gain more influence on the elements of water, fire, air and earth. Make your own castle to use the special characteristics of your people. Expand your territory and create new settlements, so that you have many workers at your disposal, or ensure a steady stream of money by building trading houses.
The fourteen beautifully shaped peoples each have unique and special characteristics. In combination with the bonus cards, which change hands every round, this creates a lot of variation which makes the course of the game always different.Terra Mystica is absolutely for people who want something different than Catan.

In some ways this is kind of the medieval version of Eclipse, though without the randomness (and direct conflict). A lot of moving parts, and a fair amount to remember, but not really that complicated. I like that you have to strike a balance between competition and cooperation, and the different faction powers are pretty nifty. I was a little intimidated by it at first, but this is one I could really enjoy.

I could see raising this to 8.  I really love how your board tells you what you get back for any building you place down.  Seems like there's a ton of variety and replayability with all the races.  I like the magic mechanic.  So why isn't it an 8?  I can't quite say.

RATING: 7
While I wish the buildings and workers weren't abstracted as blocks, I've never seen a game about terraforming before, and the shovel wheel in that regard fits with the theme. 

There's a balance between wanting to be adjacent to an opponent so that you pay less for settlements but also having to compete with theme for space.

If it weren't for the different faction powers I think this game would start to feel samey (not that there doesn't seem to be more than one path to victory especially there are several different things you can get bonus points for having the most of, just that I really like my variable setup), but faction bonuses seems like they are different enough to at least coax you to alter your strategy.

I wonder if certain factions have significantly better match ups against other factions, and wonder why the board size doesn't scale with the number of players.

EDIT: I think previously I bought a little too much into the BGG hype train and so had confirmation bias. Still a great game, but when I finish it I don't look dowb ar my cities and feel "wow, I built something really cool this game", especially sincewhile the different factions have different engines their end product are quite similar.

Not a bad game, but it seems overly complicated and overly stategic.  I would prefer if there were more tactics to each turn.

While my initial rating for this was an 8 it has now risen to a 9 after 3 plays.

I enjoy this game with any number simply because the lack of power from a lack of neighbors adds another challenge to the game as much as  a crowded board does. 5p is a bit long for my tastes but I am still willing to play that way for an occasional session.

Sometimes a game requires some work to play that game.  Other times the game is entirely work.  Terra Mystica is work.  It's gone full-throttle into the scarce resource, need-to-do-more-than-have-actions genre, mixed it with fourteen distinct factions, and then tacked on a 2-3 hour play-time.  Now there are many games that do a few of these things.  Many of them are good old German-designed Euros, but those games tend to be in the 45-75 minute range, not the 2-3 hour range.  If I'm playing a game for 2+ hours, I want it to be an epic, chaotic, deep AT title.  I don't want to play a puzzle for 2+ hours.  Terra Mystica is elegant, but not for me.

Terra Mystica is THE perfect Euro. Tight and tense, always engrossing, with each decision feeling momentous.  With only six short rounds to a game, planning is challenging and execution is gratifying.  Spatial aspect is very strong, and the constant competition for real estate, round tiles, and special actions gives the game an exciting vibe.  Extremely high replay value.  Most of the factions are exceptionally balanced.  Theme is more than adequate and component design is good.  More direction could have been given concerning faction selection among advanced players.

Very cool terraforming thing going on in this game as you try to grab up some land for your people and get some buildings going. The board for the races though do kind of bind them into a particular style of play so games with these may get a bit stale after a while.

Meh.  While [b][thing=120677][/thing][/b] is my style of Euro, it's just a little two abstracted for me.  I did appreciate how building/upgrading next to an opponent could give bonuses to both.  And I liked how each race had different abilities.  But not enough to seek out more plays.

I thought at first...this is a point salad. And all the mechanics?  This game should be a hot mess.  But somehow...it isn't?  I am not sure how they pulled this off.
This is a thinky, strategic point salad that rewards a very nice mix of tactical AND strategic thinking. Each round has a nice tactical reward, while area control and the culture track both add a nice reward for long-term strategy. Enough player action and blocking/helping and a it cut throat worker placement at the end (opponents grabbing actions you wanted).

The variability of the different races and figuring out how best to use their ability (fairly obvious, but easier said than done) is fun.  

Once I learn the races I expect my rating to settle down to a respectable 8. But now...I give this monster a 9.

Great ranking and rating.
 
Gameplay is a bit longer than ideal. 

Weight is much heavier than a gateway game. 

TV recommends it to Eurogamers.

A point-grab similar to Stefen Feld game.

Deep and heavy. Strategic and tactical.

Encourages synergy between players.

Rahdo says it's an amazing game. Rhado says that it's almost like math homework EVERY TURN. Constantly calculating and balancing the options EVERY step of the way. Very dry. As dry as chess.


Might be a too deep game for my needs.

This game reminds me so much of the old classic german boardgames: little theme with tense gameplay, interaction is there but no direct confrontation.
I know that this rating maybe affected by the 'cult of the new virus', but I just keep thinking about the different strategies available in the game. Simply marvelous!
Edited 23/2/2012: borrowed the game to a group for 2 weeks and the game has already been played more than 10 times! This speaks for the game's appeal. I played 1 more time and its problems start to show up: not repetitive, but the dragging of turns in late game and the very un-forgiving nature of the game. Sort of like a chess game, you win or lose by a single move. It's simply more difficult to notice in this game. Rating down to 8.5.
Edited on 3/10/2015. I have never played TM since 2/2012. MY copy has been borrowed by 1 of my friends and he has not played it either. It just lacks the attraction for me to play this again. However, there are quite a no of players who enjoy this game and keep playing it week by week till now. Is it just my taste? Rating down to 5.

RATING: N/A
Neat territory building game, the player boards are a little odd-looking, maybe even put-off-ish, but it's probably the coolest design of magic and fantasy I've seen in a while, being kind of gentle and not over the top.

Rulebook. Is. Effing. Terrible. WAY too detailed, not designed well, but a lot of that may be due to translation. That said, the game isn't hard to learn or teach at all, the mechanics are pretty obvious once you start reading, and further, the symbology is done so well you can see what everything does just by looking.

Bought from The Guardtower.

Initial impression is that this game has a lot of depth to offer. It was slow to learn at first due to the large number of minor exceptions to rules, and we made at least one mistake (thinking that leeching power only applied to upgrades, rather than new buildings). Subsequent games show how steep the learning curve is, you'll be thinking about this game long after you finish a session. Frustrated that I've only managed 3 plays so far, the last of these being the best with a very tense finish (tied winners) and it is a game that I can see myself being happy to play for a very long time to come. 4 plays now and most recently a win with the giants, which seem slightly underrated, on about 135vp.

An economic engine building game with variable player powers. The 14 different factions play quite differently, but it seems some are a bit weaker than others. The game has a high learning curve and AP prone players can really drag the game as there are quite many possible actions to do and you have to plan the use of your limited resources carefully. Each game is different because of the changing scoring tiles (6 out of 10) and bonus tiles (players+3 out of 9).

Terra Mystica... You are big. You are heavy. You take a good 45 minutes to teach. But there you are. Spread out over my table. Colorful and intimidating. And, I can not get enough of you. I'm now over 10 plays and can't wait for my next. You change you evolve. Now you can freeze and melt (expansion). Every play is different. The number of players changes so much about you. Yet, at your core you stay the same. You are deep and well imagined. You give me surprises every time I try a new (of the 20) factions. Observers see chaos... but us players, oh, we know. We know your dirty little secret. The fact you are an impeccably balanced A-symmetrical experience. Every race feels different even though the goal is the same for everyone. I love you so my sweet Terra Mystica. I can't wait to have you across my table again in all your colorful glory. Thank you Terra Mystica. You make me love strategy in a way I haven't in a long time. I will see you very very soon...

This game has some great core mechanics, and I like the variety between the difference races.  However, despite the differences between the races, I found that after playing a number of times (I've played around 20 or so times), the strategy for winning doesn't really change substantially, regardless of the race.  This results in it becoming very mechanically driven and repetitive with each game not feeling much different to the last.

This game has so much to offer and tons of replayability. I have seen that there are optimal first moves for each civ and that's fine. I have also heard people talk about a pasted-on theme... I see their point but I don't care. The way that I think about the theme makes it fit for me. Different races live on different tiles and have different abilities / bonuses in religions based on their race. Seems to work.

The mechanics are super cool. I love how you use your player board to track what you are doing and how everything on the board makes so much sense. We spent 3 hours learning the rules on our first play when we really only needed a few minutes to look at what you can do, then read our player boards. I should be able to teach this to new players quite quickly.
I love the power mechanic, moving those purple pieces around in the bowls really gets me thinking about what I'm doing. I need to think about how I will be using my power and if it's worth it to burn some power permanently so that I can do an action on the current turn. Being able to sacrifice power to use other power is really great, without it the game seems difficult to complete. 

I have much more to say but time is not on my side. I will say that I love playing the Halflings. I know that there are "better" races but those dudes are my jam.

I gave Terra Mystica my one and only 10 ever in my 800+ collection. I really cannot find any flaw in it's design. Even the 45 minutes you need per player pass by very quickly. Yes it is a heavy game. It is a true brain burner with tons of choices to make every turn. It is a challenge to the mind. And sure, that must be your cup of tea. Yet it is the only heavy game I found myself wanting to play right again after 3+ hours of gaming. It has no luck factor whatsoever except for the starting set up and that is not decisive for the outcome of the game. Try before you buy but do yourself a huge pleasure and play it at least once. It is a true work of art. A classic with a very functional graphic design. I find myself explaining the game in less than half an hour and all players know ,thanks to extremely well designed player boards, exactly what they can and cannot do. I thank myself every day for having a clear moment and visit the Essen stand late on sunday so I could pick up one of the unpicked preorders. It is simply the best game I have ever played.

So many aspects in this game im not sure where to start lol
great amount of replayablity for how theres nearly nothing to randomize the set up
balence seems good enough
art and quality is great
complexity is high but very straight forword, never found myself saying "yeah but what about if this happens...." nearly as much as many other games when learning it
games mechanics have a great balence of wanting to spread out vs be near, building up or out, building when
it never felt too punishing ether, a major problem I have with similar games

A great pick for a high complexity catan with slightly less interaction...i think thats the best way to put it

Build and upgrade cities similar to Settlers of Catan. Nothing random but initial setup. Every player has unique abilities and many aspects of income, additional abilities, and power to balance. First play will be confusing and difficult. Plays up to 5 in about 45 minutes per player.

This is a fun euro strategy game with almost no luck components; however, the races do not seem to be very well balanced.  Strong teraforming skills of the Darklings and Halflings seem to vastly outperform other races like the Dwarves or Fakirs.  That keeps me from rating it any higher than a 7.

Where is the theme? Lack of creativity from the designer? 

Euro game all the way. Earn this, transform in that, use to gain points. Territory building. Engine that needs to be built as soon as possible. So the first few rounds are not really very exciting. Many strategies to score points. You can play with a different race every time you play.

Having said that, the game mechanisms are smooth, and enjoyable. But 3 hours for my first play + 1 hour explanation were a bit too much. Typically a game that becomes more interesting after playing it for a few times. But then preferably with players that have played it also.

While I missed two opportunities where I could (and should) have gotten this game earlier, getting it loaned by a friend who is on a business trip for a couple of weeks allowed me to get a good couple of games in nevertheless. Those plays confirmed the high expectations I had from reading the rules and, moreover, demonstrated that this is not only a deep and very varied game, but also one that can just zoom by if people know what they are doing.

This is especially true for the two-player game, with a typical play time of less than an hour including setup, but I feel that a lot of things that shine with more players merely twinkle in a duel. The race for the cult bonuses and the biggest network are decidedly less tense, and I’m not sure whether this can be improved by just distributing points for 1st and 3rd instead of 1st and 2nd place to steepen the slope. Likewise, the decisions of whom to help and to hinder are obviously trivial when there’s just a single opponent. After three two-player games, my possibly premature judgement is that this is a good way to learn how to optimise your building tree, but you’re not getting the full game this way.

The good news is that all the subtle interactions get cranked up as soon as you add a third player, and the full five player game is just pure joy for me. Weaving an aspect of good neighbourship (cost reduction for trading houses and the magic boost from nearby construction) into the usual competition for building space is the key design decision that sets Terra Mystica apart. As far as I can tell from eight played games, the good design is coupled with good development and excellent graphical design. The latter greatly contributes to smooth play, since there are many subtle reminders of how everything works on the board.

About the only thing that would hinder my current estimation of Terra Mystica as a great game, not merely a very good one, would be the discovery that some of the available factions really are more powerful than others. So far, however, I feel that the impact of player skill is higher by orders of magnitude – there might be some factions that are more straightforward to play and therefore seem to be better in the first and, possibly, the second game (which, let’s be honest, is the typical amount of plays a game will see from the majority of the BGG population), but with a bit more experience, it all seems to even out.

Update: Rating settles at 10 after 50+ games. Fulfilled all expectations and then some.

Pretty damn complicated. A bit too much, honestly. And with only 6 turns (which nonetheless each take around 20-25 minutes) it's also one of those games that ends right as you're getting going, like many Euro games, a mechanic which I don't care for at all. You can easily make a mistake early on which completely screws you over, with little to no chance of being able to recover. Therefore, you have to be extremely knowledgeable of the game to even begin doing well at it. And with an average game taking about 2.5 hours, that's a lot of time commitment. I don't personally like the game enough to warrant taking that much time to get good at it.

One of the few Euros that also does a perfect job of forcing conflict between players, due to the tile placement system.  By far my favorite tile-laying game out there. 
 Like most complex Eurogames, it can be very difficult to develop a strategy until you've played it a few times.  There are so many available options and it is difficult to choose a long term path that will lead to victory.

Boy I don't know... I definitely appreciate the design of the game but it may not be for me.  I just may not be smart enough for it.  I had a hard time figuring it out.  There are multiple spendable "currencies" if you will: money, white cubes, meeple dudes, and purple mana discs (Yes, I'm getting all the thematic names wrong.)  So there's different ways to get all those, and different structures to build, that only build or upgrade in a certain order, but you have to terraform first, which also costs stuff, and if you upgrade buildings it lowers your income of some of those resources, and one of the currencies has to be cycled through "bowls of power" (or something like that) in a certain way before it's usable...  I mean, I like it and it's awesome how there's different races that all have different abilities and advantages - but man, maybe I'm just too dumb to see it all, and put together a plan that would help me play well.

So yeah, I say cool game, but too much stuff going on for me perhaps.

I feel conflicted about this game, so I am not going to rate it yet. There are a lot of moving parts, and it seemed to take a long time (4 hours?) for a game with three new players and two experienced players.  It is a somewhat interesting puzzle to work out optimal moves (AP Alert!), but I also somewhat agree with Clearclaw that there are not many interesting questions or decisions to make.  For the time it took, I'd rather play Roads and Boats, I think.

So many interlocking mechanisms, so much depth.  Granted, I have not played it enough to weigh in on the idea that you HAVE to play your faction according to some fairly prewritten playbook, and there is the issue of auctioning factions when players are new to the game.

Have to see how the upcoming Gaia Project plays out to see if this gets replaced.

The only game in my collection that I want to play more is Tzolk'in. Terra Mystica, however, is the one that other people will actually play with me. Also, I have been the winner of every game we have played so far, much to the annoyance of all my fellow gamers. 

There is a lot to love about this game. We finish a game and immediately want to play again. All the little pieces. The fact that all the factions are different and give different abilities. It all just works together and makes this a much more enjoyable game than I thought it was going to be the first time I saw it.  I think I could even come to love it more than Tzolk'in, since I can't seem to win that game to save my life.

Medium weight standard euro game. I am not very impressed, but I would certainly play it again. I did like the asymmetry of races. I didn't like that the map remains the same regardless the number of players. I also don't get why it has "civ" under BGG's category classification.
Anyway. Solid design, decent amount of interaction between players (unlike most typical euros), but a bit too generic and dry for my taste.

RATING: 8
Our first play with four took an hour to set up and explain and three hours to play, making this unlikely to hit the table often -- which is too bad, because it's a really good game.

Playing it made me feel dumb, but I still came in second. It has a lot of knock-on effects and levers to pull and things to manipulate, and everything in it -- absolutely everything -- is important to your score. And of course it's not possible to do everything well, making for plenty of enjoyable turn angst.

Sometimes individual actions are quite clear, so turns are fairly brisk. But every rounds take longer, and is a more decision-rich environment, as the game progresses.

There are elements of two other games I love in it, Small World and Castles of Burgundy, but it's heavier than either of them. The balance of strategy and tactics is excellent, though I didn't always feel like I knew why I was doing things (unlike either of those two games).

The rulebook and iconography are some of the best I've ever seen. Every inch of the player mat tells you something in shorthand, and the same goes for the other components. With a poorly written rulebook or bad graphic design, this game would fall completely flat; there's too much going on for that.

For me, it'd be tricky to introduce to new players (at least for now). I asked everyone to read the rulebook beforehand, and I don't know that I'd feel comfortable teaching it cold. That plus its length makes it a tricky sell, but I'll be holding onto it for those chances, however rare they might be, to play it again.

Second play was much smoother and more in line with the expected play time. Such an elegant game!

RATING: 9
Rating after 6 plays.  Fantastic game, very addictive.  Plays in well under 2 hours with 4 players.  Tons of replayability.  I was worried about the map not being modular, but see now why that doesn't matter.  Each game has enough variation and with no luck after setup it makes for an interesting time.  The players are the luck, not the game.  I can see this getting 50 or more plays easy.

So far, so good. It's still not my final opinion, because I got to play it more.
Likes:
- It is rich! There's so much going on that it really makes for the luck of any randomness. You can focus on different things every time you play. There's money, and workers, and priests, and power, and...
- It's variable - you have different bonus tiles and scoring tiles and of course different races. It never feels (so far) the same game.
- It;s not only important what you do, but also WHEN you do it (because of the scoring tiles). It creates even more choices.
- It's very interconnected - every decision has impacts on other things.

One of the most solid and replayable games I know. The question of how to do well with each race always comes up in each game; some are just harder to use well than others (halflings, anyone?)

What I most enjoy about the game is that to win you have to plan your game around the round bonuses. When and how you expand is directly influenced by when you get bonuses for it. Great game, and I have never turned down a match.

Bought at Kingslayer Comics 2/20/16.

Initial reviews said that this had horrible 2-player gameplay and was fairly soulless.  However, the first weekend we bought this, we couldn't stop playing.  5 games in that first weekend, all at 2-players.  Interaction is less than what it would be at 4, but it's still there and it still matters - power bonuses, cult track, blocking all still count.

While the map is fixed, each race plays quite differently.  Round scoring and bonuses also differ each game, thus increasing replayability.  I now understand why this was rated so highly for so long.

Theme is definitely pasted on, but not as thin as I've been led to believe.  It may have been the result of lowered expectations, but I felt that some aspects - i.e. race bonuses to be thematic.  Nomads live in tents, which are easy to set up, so have more dwellings.  Swarmlings reproduce quickly, but require more income as a result.  These all make sense with a small stretch. 

The lack of race balances does, however, irk me.  We played a game of Darklings vs. Fakirs to see how much this affects gameplay, and it really does.  The Fakirs ability felt pretty useless.  They even start out with less Bowl 2 power, making them even more awkward to play.

---
Update 3/14/16.  I still want to play this ALL THE TIME.  This is entrenched as a solid 9.  May creep up as a 10.

Update 5/6/16.  Rating increased from 9 to 9.5.  Played this at 4p with Michelle and Daniel.  It was awesome, and the interactions really shone through.  Game time was relatively quick for a 4p game, and there were plenty of difficult decisions.  I still want to play this even more.

Maybe it's just not my thing, but this didn't feel like a game. It felt like a logic puzzle with so many variables involved that i just wound up guessing things so as not to slow the game down.

I'm not sure I get what all the fuss is about. The art on the player boards and main board is as bland as can be, there are balance issues, not just among the races themselves, but in what lands the mix of races in any particular game is going to be competing for, that power wheel is the dumbest, most unthematic mechanism I've ever seen in a euro, and the process of getting a cult track reward where you get one of a whole bunch of tiles brings the whole game to a halt as someone examines each and every tile.

I mean, it's not as bad as I'm making it sound, but it's an ordinary, flawed euro in my book.

One of my favorite heavy games.
Awesome modern classic of heavy strategy games. Replayability is very good due to different races. I'll never want to play it with the online player crowd though, it's sadly a game that can be analyzed to death with best openings etc. I've reduced a rating since because of this. For same reason as Chess it'll never be a true favorite for me, they are games that attract unfun crowd for some reason. Sci-fi theme would be cool.

2-Player Comment:
* Terra Mystica works well with two evenly skilled opponents. Unofficial 2p variant: When setting up the game, put unused colour priests to spaces 3 and 5 of each cult track, and consider them 3rd & 4th player in final scoring.

Solid "9" that could easily go up to a "10" in a few more plays.

Pretty darn sweet!

Best mash-up I can come up with is "Hansa T." meets "Settlers" meets "Small World", but that does not come close to decoding the game play.

Currently the best game of 2013 if you are a Euro player.

Maybe the best game I've played in the last 3 years.

If you have the chance, give it a whirl.

Very good game.  A real gamers' game. Lots going on, many things to think about and different strategies to try. I think this is one that will reward repeated play.   Many moving parts to being able to play effectively - temple tracks, income streams, power cycling, area control, targeting bonuses etc.

Pieces, artwork and theme are very ordinary and those with colour blindness may have difficulty.

If you are looking for a light fun game to play, or a game to play with non gamers, then this is not the game for you.

This game is near perfection.  TM is a game full of diversity of set-up, and always interesting and tense in-game decisions that never outstays its welcome.  4 player games can easily be completed in 2 hours (not counting set-up and teardown).

The depth of the game is apparent on first play, which can make it seem rather daunting for the first or second time player.  However, the play is so engaging, you'll come back for more.

RATING: 9
Terra Mystic is a game that offers so much depth and interesting choices, that you find yourself constantly coming back for more. This game really appeals to heavy euro gamers looking for an experience that is just as interesting the firsttime you play as the twentieth time. Once you understand the mechanics, the icons and actions are intuitive and easy to remember.
 
It might not appeal to everyone. There are mini-game like mechanics (cult track and power bowls) that add unnecessary complexity for teaching new players. The theme is pasted on. The factions are not necessarily balanced. It really shines with three or more players if you don't use the variant rules. 

Unfortunately, Gaia Project has replaced this game for me. I still think Terra Mystica is an excellent game and I would gladly play it, but Gaia Project does everything Terra Mystica does better.

Terra Mystica is at the heavier end of the worker placement, euro game spectrum, there are a lot of moving parts to keep track of and the theme, while a cool idea, is pretty pasted on.

Definitely only for the hardcore euro fan.

Nearly perfect in balance, and board design. So many great mechanics.  

The only problems I have with it are that there are too many pieces, it takes a while to sit down and learn really well, and it does take a while to play.  

There are all good things about it too though..  lots of depth, lots to learn, and takes a little while, but it does end!  The game is on a "timer" of sorts, ending after 6 rounds.  It comes with enough races to make the game interesting every time, and can be played with 2 to 5 players.  

Each race has it's own play style, and the flavors are well thought out.  The cultist track was probably the most odd addition to the game, but still really cool.  

Definitely giving this a 9!

I am sure this one will be over-analysed eventually with 'best openings' and optimised play in given conditions, but the journey getting there will be a lot of fun. The situation reminds me a Puerto Rico in the sense that perfect information games are prone to analysis and suffer with unequally skilled players. Terra Mystica seems more open than Puerto Rico and the selection of races allow for some some tuning to player skill. 

The criticism that there is limited player interaction is quite fairly levelled in some circumstances, I feel the game is at it's best when played with the more interactive races than the solitaire optimisation ones, although I view this as a feature of having the wide range to choose from. I am generally happy to live with some games not having as much cut and thrust as others. 

This might well slip off the 10 spot, but for now it's a winner. I have enjoyed every game of this I have played so far.

Excellent intriguing game that blends together many familiar mechanisms and adds at least one new one (the way power works). Optimization game, interaction could have been more. Different races with different abilities keep the game varied. Each race requires a different development route. You need to plan for that at the start of the game to take maximum advantage of those special abilities. The bonus tile you choose each round can also be critical to your development. I like it better with each play, the game remains in my head. It is a challenging game, but for a spatial game interaction remains limited.

Update: played all 14 races. Now that I tried them all, the choice at the start to pick a race depending on bonustiles, roundtiles other colours and races in play etc. is great and challenging. I love this game more and more. It has lots of long term and short term planning. in some cases it is possible to largely plan your actions for the full game ahead to take maximum advantage of bonusses. And I love it when a plan comes together, some guy named Hannibal used to say in the 80's.

Further update: 22 plays and I still don't tire of it. Fascinating game, I love the short term and long term planning possibilities. Upgraded to 9.5.

The different factions provide some interesting dynamics, however, the mechanics make the use of these different powers either difficult to use or overpowered. There is always more to do than you can afford, which makes a game challenging, but there doesn't seem to be a balance between what you can do and what you need to do, and made the outcomes of my plays feel less earned and more happenstance. Over all, a decent game, but there are far better worker placement games on the market.

I was enthusiastic about this game at first but the newness quickly fade into a sense of multiplayer solitaire with interactions only there to speckle the game with a sense of "you are nota lone"

I know people say this game is no good with two players, but hey, beggars can't be choosers and I'll take what I can get.  The past 4 games I've played have been two player and I know this game would shine with more, but I love it already.  Can't play it enough!

There's always at least one resource that I come up short, forcing me to make a few sacrifices.  So many options, but you can't accomplish them all!

Good, solid area dominance euro with unneccessarily fiddlish rondel mechanics thrown in loosly set in a fantasy world with abstracted fantasy races. 

Features a bucketful of simultaneous mechanics and competitive scoring tracks yet they are coherent and make sense together (unlike that vile croc of offal Trajan). 

Manages a rather high degree of interaction in that positioning next to other players have advantages in percolating up more wildcard resources to spend. 

A bit long but offers decent entertainment for the time it assumes. Not a true brain burner, it ranks in middle-depth euros, about the same difficulaty and demands of concentration as Power Grid.

This game is a clear 10 in my book. I've played it several times and it continues to be one of those games that I think about long after I've finished playing.

Update 2017-01-03: Rating reduced as I’ve learned this game has solutions. IMO each race has a correct way to play it and if you try to step away from that pathway you will lose to equally skilled players. Gaia Project is quickly replacing this for me.

Good looking, different factions, mechanics work etc. It just should be more fun... 

1st game didn't grab me as it should have. 2nd play felt slightly better. But for me the mechanics don't fit together in either a logically or thematic sense. For a game that easy takes 3 hours I really don't to try it again, so I'll avoid playing this. Hence the low rating.

Strategic heaven. A multitude of different races with their own special abilities, variable set-up, no luck or hidden information, a balance between staying clear of opponents to avoid being built in, and staying close to benefit from cheaper building costs and gaining power from opponents.

To avoid players choosing the same race/faction over and over again, I recommend mixing up and randomly assigning everyone a board. Players still get to choose which of the two factions on the board they want to play, but it often means they have to adapt to a different play style than their usual, which keeps things interesting and can help players discover new fun ways of playing the game.

I did not expect I would like this, let alone buy it, but nobody else of our gaming group planned to get it at Essen, so I decided to take the plunge.  Very happy to have done so.  Throws everything but the kitchen sink in a blender, sometimes almost an overwhelming variety, but at the same time it plays pretty straightforward when you get going.  There are a great number of different creatures you can play, so there should be good variability between games.  Eagerly looking forward to my next game of this.

Had to teach myself this game so I could teach the people I play with. Made getting the first game going daunting due to the sheer amount of options that are available even with the recommended first game setup, but after one full game you got the sense of the flow. Will take many plays before it is fully understood and how the races interact. Look forward to peeling back the layers of this game.

Update - bumped up to 9 from 8 (7 games in). I knew finding people to play this with me would be a challenge and almost made me not get it, as it might not see many plays. However, when you are able to get someone to invest in learning the rules, I have had success in getting them to play again. Currently the game I would pick first if I got to pick a game.

Update 2.0 - Bumped this from 9 to 10. After many plays of this game, it is still my favorite game I own. It has had a staying power that almost none of the other 40 games I own have achieved. If my house was to burn down, this is the first game I would replace.

There are two main reasons I liked games like caylus or burgen von burgund slightly better than terra mystica.

Takes the lighter and faster playing [gameid=107529] and adds an action wheel, powers and building upgrades. They certainly are different games but it's hard not to compare.

So what do I think? Well, first I wish I had my opponent's powers instead of my own. Second, the wheels are neat, the buildings are cool but a pain at times to time their placements correctly. Not as free-wheeling as it looks, certainly a bit of a brain-burner at times. Interesting thematic/euro blend.

I would like this to be Settlers++ or even Settlers#. I'm afraid it will not attain that status, and I cannot even say for sure why I do not like it as much as expected.

One drawback surely is the favor collection, which I really dislike (also in many other games). I do not like spending resources that do not progress my board situation.

This very well-designed eurogame is my current favourite. It's very satisfying to place big wooden pieces on the board and watch your empire grow.

With 14 races and variable round and bonus tiles, replayability should be good. I would guess that some races are unbalanced, at least in some combinations with other races and number of players. I would have liked an option of bidding for races, rather than just choosing them, but that can be house-ruled.

Also, I would have liked a second map on the back of the board, or even better: some kind of variable board. Still, as it is, I don't know of any better game.

TM is true to the phrase, "Easy to learn, difficult to master." I still haven't figured out how to play the game well, but i do enjoy it. It's theme is somewhat lacking but I still enjoy playing when in the mood. The rules are fairly long but they provide plenty of examples. The wooden bits are very nice but again lacking in theme. I do want to play this more often, at least play half of the different races.

This is my favorite game. It has a great mix of strategy and tactics, rewarding the player for making choices based on the initial setup but also reacting to the moves by his opponents. It features a ton of direct player interaction without involving combat or destruction. The replayability is off the charts. Every choice requires the consideration of many factors and is so weighty. Timing is critical.

Almost always want to play. With our core group we can play a 4p game in 90 minutes, though I'm happy to teach it and play longer learning games as well. Great game.

A relatively long explanation is required for this one, as the game has a good number of rules, but you're rewarded with a meaty, planning-heaving game that has some player interaction (but no attacking or destruction of other players' items, which is refreshing).

I've played this once, and enjoyed it, but ended up making two key mistakes in the placement phase which hurt tremendously.  After the rules explanation I didn't realize how powerful it would be to be a) close to other players, to get power, and b) how important it would be to be able to connect up my independent cities later in the game.  So, while the game was fun, it was mildly frustrating to realize after a turn or two that I was almost certainly destined to lose badly :(

Excellent euro with a touch of theme. Top points for components. The gameplay is very quick and I like that each faction has a few differences. Theres a careful balance that needs to be kept between which buildings you go for. Ideally you want to maximize the bonus points from tiles and cities, but getting them isn't always easy. Probably the best euro of 2012

What a delightful game.  

The core of the game, that as magical factions we each have a chosen type of terrain and will use our magic to terraform the world around us to meet our needs and thus be able to build settlements there, is already a more fun derivation of the Settlers of Catan hexmap idea.  But the (for new players and veterans alike) dizzying array of options and possibilities.  The learning curve is a bit steep at the beginning of the game, but I have found that all people I play this with end up loving it once the rhythm of the game makes sense to them.  The expansion is not necessary - but makes an awesome game even more fun by virtue of further replay value!

Szép játék, rengeteg komponenssel, nem rövid, de érthető és logikus szabályzattal. Ennyi a pozitívum.

Nekem valahogy a téma nem jön át, messze nem kapott el az a flow érzés, amiről sokan írnak internet-szerte. Túlságosan steril, mondhatjuk, hogy kunyhókat (házikókat), kereskedőházat, erődöt, templomot és szentélyt építünk, de ettől ezek még - kifejezetten - ronda kis fakockák lesznek, amiket rendkívül szűkös erőforrásainkból kell kigazdálkodnunk (már-már kényelmetlenül kis mozgástérrel). Gyakorlatilag a játék 90%-ban azon agyalunk, hogy miből termeljük ki a következő építkezést és még a játék felénél is azon frusztrálódunk, hogy még egy nyamvadt erődöt sem tudtunk összehozni, pedig... Túlzott AP hatás bejátszik, már-már élvezhetetlen, pedig nekifutottunk párszor.

Röviden: rossznak nem mondanám, mert akinek bejön a patikamérlegen kimért stratégiázás és 2-3 órán keresztül a folyamatos számolgatás egy absztrakt pályán és komponensekkel, annak ez legalább egy 7-8-as játék lesz. A játékot körülvevő hype (és az ára) alapján ennél jóval többet vártam volna. [Ha egy 6.000 Ft-os játék lenne a BGG 500. helye körül, egy szavam nem lenne rá...]

Bennünket nagyon nem fogott meg, nekifutottunk háromszor, de továbbra sem értem, hogyan lett ebből top10-es játék pár hónap alatt...

UPDATE (2017.02.27.): szóló variánst kipróbálva - 3 ellenfél ellen - már egészen jó volt, fel is pontoztam (lehet, hogy két játékossal volt csak ennyire béna?).

Rating is tentative after first play and could certainly improve. There's a helluva lot going on in this game, and it works together well enough, but I am still not quite yet convinced there's a way to play it competitively instead of as multi-player solitaire, nor am I quite convinced it's actually deep and not just an overly complex set of game mechanisms bolted on top of each other. Still I do look forward to trying it again and I will definitely reserve final judgement until that time.
---------------------------------------

Gets better with each play. It's odd because there's nearly nothing new here, mechanically, but it combines together for some interesting and difficult choices throughout the game, and I am now starting to see the potential for conflict inherent in the game. Can't wait to play it more.

I don't think this one's going to last much longer for me. The key to this game is recognizing your group's special ability and how to best play it, but I'm not sure how interesting repeated play with the same group will be. In my second game, I was fortunate enough to play the Nomads, which everyone said were "easy," and I guess they were, since I was just one point away from winning. I had everything planned out two rounds in advance through out the game, so I spent most of the time just waiting on other players. Playing for the round-by-round building bonuses seems to be a pretty solid strategy, but it could be that it's solid only with certain groups (like the Nomads). The only thing that would draw me back in would be the prospect of playing a different group, but if I find that the building bonus strategy works yet again then my interest in this title might conclude.

RATING: 7
I WANT to like this a lot more than I think that I do.  People keep comparing it to Eclipse and Hansa Teutonica (and even Kingdom Builder), games that I like but I just don't feel the similarities that much.  They share one similar mechanic (which I really do like), removing pieces from a board to uncover increasing supply.  But otherwise, these games feel nothing alike.

I've played it twice now.  I did alright with the Nomads, but had a horrible time with the Engineers.  It was brutal trying to get workers and feeling like I had substantially less options than most everyone else.  So I don't know if this is a problem with the variable powers not being well-balanced or if I just wasn't able to determine the dominant strategy.  But as I thought over my moves, I really couldn't see a way to increase the worker supply that I desperately needed (and which others seemed to have plenty.)

The game looks beautiful, and I usually love a game with a good spacial element, so I feel like I owe it a few more games.  But it does feel a little long for what it is.  There isn't much to do between turns and there's a lot of information to process, including what other people have resources and ability to do, their position and whether you can afford to wait a turn to do something.  There's a lot going on and you can get cut-off at any number of points along your decision tree, which can derail a well-thought out plan.  I'm sure this is all part of the fun for some, but for me my decisions felt more arbitrary than interesting trying to guess what others were trying to do and feeling powerless to change them when I did know.

I WILL say, that though it may be a decent game, I think the general response to this game is way over what it deserves.  It may not be my type of game but neither do I think it's the kind of genius everyone seems to think it is.  I'm afraid it's mostly hype for a game that is in short supply.

BUT, after 2 plays, I still am intrigued enough to want to play again.  I'm hoping familiarity will increase our speed of play and improved strategy, my enjoyment.

I thought Terra Mystica would have had more original mechanics based on the aha-erlebnis of other bgg users but it just incorporates mechanics of Tzolk'in, Small world and Settlers into a new game... a good one though and it's interesting enough, but I'm not fully convinced yet. The rating might go up in the future but I need to play it often enough to get a grip on it but since it lasts 3 hours or longer, I don't think it will happen soon... together with Le Havre, this is the heaviest game I've ever played (based on bgg ratings) although the latter seems lighter to me.

RATING: 7.5
This is an extremely punishing area-control game with a very restrictive economy & a tight, linear strategic path.  The tightness of the economy (limited money & limited access to bridges ) & screw-factor from other players make this extremely frustrating.  Bad moves can leave you in a position where you are completely locked out of options:  meaning a bad player can get into a position where they are denied having any more fun. In the best of cases, the game-play is rather dry. Finally, the starting races do not seem well-balanced, which can add to the frustration.

RATING: 9
A fantastic game with deeply layered strategy, multiple paths to victory, asymmetrical player factions and even some light player interaction, which many heavy euros lack completely. The player boards and various components are littered with symbols and your first play-through will mostly be about acquiring literacy in the game's symbology and mechanics, but once you do, the beauty and fun of this game shine out like a silver dollar in a chimney-sweep's ear.
HOWEVER, this is NOT a game for everyone. While I really appreciate the subtle layers of strategy that build upon themselves and the many different ways to acquire VP's, for some folks it will just be too many choices. Even the most astute players will suffer from some level of AP (Analysis Paralysis), and those who already have a problem with AP will be absolutely dazed (in our first play, it took one player 10 minutes just to realize they had nothing left to do and pass).

Long, cold and dry exercise in engine building for the sake of it, using childhood wooden blocks. Fantasy theme is glued like in the worst jokes about "dry themeless euro". 
Yes - as an engine, it works almost flawlessy.
Yes - there's a nice strategy with good decisions.

But really, it's not for me. I can see that it appeals to the euro people though, fine for them, and more room for better games onto my shelves!

A crowd pleaser. The game almost has it all for small groups of friends: rules are streamlined and easy to grasp in the first match; you can lead a strategy and leading a good one is rewarding; it has a lot of replayability because of races and goal randomization; it lasts for a decent amount of time to fill an evening; it is rewarding to see what you built and achieved in the end.
Probably one of the games that will see more table in my collection.

A solid euro game. What I like the most about Terra Mystica is that most actions make you feel good even though they were not optimal. Also, using spells helps you to correct your mistakes later on. At the first glance races felt quite balanced (because the differences are not that big) and they surely make every game feel a bit different.

Even though Terra Mystica is an euro game, I was left hoping the theme was strapped onto the mechanics more. I know this is common in the euros but this game mostly felt themeless. Some mechanics of Terra Mystica also felt overly complicated for not a specific reason (for example, the magic power management).

I will surely enjoy playing this game many times but if looking for the all time favorite, nope, I need more theme for that.

Beautiful but busy map. Interesting game with lots of submechanics interrelating. Its like someone merged Eclipse, Dominant Species and a little bit of small world but left out all the conflict and randomness to make it Eurogamer friendly. 

Would definitely play this again with experienced players who move quickly. I doubt it would get played much in my usual gaming circles as I can see the AP-inducing range of options causing downtime blowout, turning what should be a quick 2 hour game into a 4 hour game.

Like Karnag this has a "quirky" feel to it. The 3 brain segments and power disks moving between them produce a clever mechanism to gain additional actions etc. 
The theme of fantastical creatures terra-forming a world works effectively.
I would play again if given the chance but the long runtime will limit the opportunity to do so.
After a second play my rating has increased to 8.1. This is a really great game, but needs to be played by gamers who don't suffer from AP.

Solid, offers a nice point optimization puzzle, although I'm not sure whether I'm a huge fan of the cumulative point churning mechanisms these kind of heavy euros rely on. But at least the different races with their different powers provide you with a gameplan.

Maybe a bit too long considering the payoff; it IS just point collecting with very little interaction and a completely pasted on theme. It's also very unforgiving: mess up your economy and there's nothing worthwhile for you to do for the rest of the game. Six turns is very little. This scarcity of money seems to make two of the actions (money, double-shovel) much more important than the rest, thus the competition is mainly for those two.

1/6/15 Update:
Hmmm..., well I've played it my 3rd time now, and I have to say it is growing on me, and it is a very good game, even though I'm not so sure about the theme.  Still not sure that I need to pick up my own copy.

Update:
Only played twice and it's a good enough game, but not good enough to warrant a purchase from me.  Little too dry and heavy for my tastes.

Original comment:
Someone described it as a "soulless Euro", and I have to agree.  The theme here is very weak.  Stefan Feld games that people complain have a pasted on theme, have much better theme and theme integration than this game.

Very much an abstract game, which I don't mind, that didn't really resonate with me on my first play.  

Bottom line, an intriguing game that "appears" to be a good.  However, "I" did not find it all that exciting or fun.

A solid heavier Euro, but way too overrated by some people. It kind of feels like Catan meets Small World, but it's much more complex. I have fun with the game, though I guess I don't see why it has climbed the rankings so quickly. It could use some streamlining, and it doesn't really do anything different or innovative. It's just a 4x-style game where they forgot to add in the combat.

I finally got to play one of the highest rated game on the BGG. Terra Mystica has an intricate economy of buildings for income, mana for special powers and cult tracks for endgame scoring. This is combined with a unique take on area control, where you need to transform areas before taking control. Unfortunately, the designers added a point salad of various scoring opportunities and variable player powers that detract from the economy/terraforming gameplay. The strategy is often dictated from the start ("use your powers to maximize A round 1, B round 2 etc.") and much of the game become an exercise of mathematical optimization, particularly in the last round which can really drag. Terra Mystica earns its reputation but I would personally have preferred a cleaner design, focusing on the core mechanisms.

An excellent engine-building game. I like how it encourages you to keep your opponents close - but not too close. If someone builds next to you then you can get magic power, but they may also block you and prevent you from expanding!

It is impossible to fight in this game. There are no combat mechanics. So you must use sneaky tactics to foil the plans of your enemies. This gives the game a very unique feeling compared to the other civilization games in my collection and I like that a lot.

This is a very heavy game. I would only recommend this for experienced board gamers! There are many rules to learn and remember. But once you figure it out, it's extremely good.

Hardcore, but an extremely satisfied gaming experience. 
The learning curve is high, partly because of the complicated rule-set, although everything sounds quite intuitive once you know the rules. Game play is swift and smooth after a few play as well.

What I like about the games is its characterization - as you are leading different tribes, you need to play differently. The round bonus cards and players' tribe choices and position affects how you choose your tribe, and then different tribes might in some way affect each others. 

This is a game of deep planning, but at the same time ask you to be opportunistic when situation comes up to take advantage. It's very dynamic, as a player's choice would affect another player, and subsequently the other players. The good thing about the game is while it's interactive, it is not chaotic - everything can be cauclated. There's basically zero random factor after all the set-up is done. It's the players that manage the outcome of the game.

With more expansion in the future, I can only see its appeal goes up and up. This is what a modern Euro should be - with a touch of thematic elements, characterization, cutthroatness while retain the need of planning and calculation in most Euro game.

There are two major flaws for me with this one:
1. Game feels "empty". Its lore is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. It never felt that the witches were conquering lands to the giants, while trading with the undead... if that could ever make any sense. The boardgame being so ugly to look at does not help either.
2. Game mechanics feel too complicated for what the game delivers. Don't get me wrong: I love some heavy games when the complexity actually makes sense. But with this game, it feels like it was pretentiously made more complex than it should, just for the sake of it. 
I am probably giving this another go in a couple of weeks before trading it out, but I do not have many expectations that this will change my mind (sadly).

RATING: 2
A colorful, but utterly themeless game about transforming one type of points into other types of points in order to score points. It's quite depressing how pasted-on the whole 'factions'-flavour is. The game is an extremely tedious accounting/optimisation exercise, where even the slightest suboptimality will lose you the game, despite going for an elegant strategy. There is something hypnotic here, but the lack of theme is a killer, since the game doesn't really tell any story. 

I could make a better game by reskinning an excel spreadsheet with a quick goblin theme. The player board itself is a total mess... There's nothing intuitive about changing one type of vp to another there: it's all for the sake of itself. It feels like unpaid dull accounting work where there are a few optimal ways to complete the optimisation problem, and deviating from the path leads to an embarrassing so-what ending. The different factions are different, but they have no human character or artistic merit. It's all barebones fog without anything underneath. They made the equations, but they forgot to make a Game. It has so much excess stuff that just increases downtime but not enjoyment: the tracks are like an afterthought. 

Spending the purple disks permanently has little penalty... It makes no sense. That whole cycling mechanism is just a terrible gimmick, like siri on smartphones. It's cool, but pointless. For a game that is all about interchanging points of different types, the game feels pointless, and has no intuitive feeling of achievement. This game isn't made for humans, I think. It has no humour, no soul. Just slow monotony.  

The theme could Not be more mismatched, I'd probably play Lords of Waterdeep as an rpg before getting into any mood with terra mystica. Even The name is pretentious. Rock paper scissors is more mystical. I think that a board game that has no 'human' non-stat-sheet dramatic arc to convey better be really Damn short and free of fiddliness. I don't just hate terra mystica, I think it is the worst kind of pretentious nonsense, failing in every strength that it purports to achieve. Different ways to win? Illusion. Very little luck? That's because there's very little of anything exciting. Strategic planning? Until someone permanently spends all the purple disks and everyone does it. The cost of terrain? Tedious gimmick... Nobody will ever build on more than a few terrains then.

The suboptimal path is so suboptimal that there is neither luck nor choice. Players Might as well be in a coma then. Finishing the game was like waking from a bad stuffy dream or finishing a dull day of labour. The opposite of refreshing. It focuses on all the gimmicks and needless mechanisms (made for the designers and for all the cogs themselves, not for people), but not on how the different phases are supposed to make the player Feel! That is just terrible design, for my taste. Even abstract games like Hive or chess make me Feel something. But playing terra mystica makes me feel depressed, like I ate something wrong or the bureaucrats accidentally sent me a 1000-page archive of aborted short-term initiatives. Great games make the board and the space of play around the table feel more alive, hyper-alive even, in a heightened state,,, and then there's Terra Mystica, a numbness better known as brain gangrene.

Not going to rate this one because I feel like I don't speak the language well enough to give it a rating.  Art and component design was great, but economy games have always confounded me somewhat.  It's not that I didn't like it, simply that I was very bad at it, and felt like I didn't have a good grasp on the multifarious interlocking systems such that I could begin to win an advantage.  I appreciate its excellent design, but I probably won't buy it.

The team I play felt that the Halflings are overpowered (I won my first game with them), but I see this as situational because of the turn bonuses and the order in which they came.

I see a lot of replayability value in this game because of the random setup, though it can seem a bit dry due to the components look and feel. Other than a few images on the race-sheets, it seems not so "fantasy-like" as it perhaps should. Especially the terrain on the board and buildings are "Settler-of-Catan-ish", which is a bad thing in my book.
I would definitely get a deluxe version of this, should it ever come.

Even though the rules look overly complex, it was only necessary to check the rules for racial benefits, other than that there was no checking of the rules. It plays fluently.

Each player starts with a unique race, that has special abilities. Players start off native to a particular terrain, and will transform neighboring terrain into their terrian so that they can build their own structures on it to form cities. 

Each player has a player mat, where there are three bowls of power. Cubes taken out of the third bowl allow you to spend power points on resources in the game. Building beside an opponent will allow them to get power points, at a cost of some victory points. 

When you build dwellings onto the board, they uncover income for the next phase. When you build a religious dwelling you get to take a favor tile which gives you benefits during the game. 

There is a cult track which rewards points for those who are highest on the four tracks. Finally, there is end game scoring for those who have the most connected dwellings. 

There is a ton of stuff going on here, and you have to decide which bonus tiles you want to choose, and which scoring tiles to take advantage of. I've only played one game, but I'm looking forward to more plays. Game does clock in toward the longer side, but I was immersed the whole game. Rating likely to rise with more plays.

Wonderful game. Thinky and competitive to the end and presenting a constantly evolving situation to deal with. The decisions are fine tuned to be just enough beyond human mental capacity to compute so most people can get a good idea of what might be a good thing to do in any situation but can't work out the perfect choice.

Lo probe en una noche de juegos con un grupo de juego experimentado, dos lo estabamos probando por primera vez y dos ya tenian mas de 8 y 25 partidas respectivamente en su recorrido, paso lo que tenia que pasar...perdimos los dos novatos, pero quedamos con un buen sabor de boca: Inicia con bastantes reglas que son entendidas mas facil si te las explican con ejemplos! (la explicacion duro 20 minutos), a partir de ahi, se cometen errores de novatos al usar recursos escasos en jugadas que luego los "experimentados" te haran caer en cuenta, fluye el juego a medida que uno sepa las distintas acciones que tienes disponibles; Las razas tienen demasiada ingerencia en la victoria final. Chevere, cada partida es distinta...Lo volveria a jugar

Terra Mystica... 

A mystery as to why it is so loved. Have heard the following about this game: adult catan, like chess, abstract, dry, heavy, hard work like doing taxes... what makes it so highly rated then?

Supposedly best for 4-5 players. How does it play with 2 and 3?

Hm, don't care anymore. The more I read about it, the more I am certain it isn't a game for me. I prefer direct interaction with other players and then there is this: https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/187977/item/4264102#item4264102

1 word. Amazing!  The races are fun to play and give a lot of variety to gameplay. No luck. All random things are set up prior to picking your race. So choosing a good race to go with the combinations on the board can help your score but not entirely necessary to win the game. The player interaction in my eyes is perfect.

RATING: 8
Engine building goodness. I thought I would care more about the lack of theme, but I was so focused on building my engine that it didn't matter. I made a stupid move in round 2, and thought it was over, but the game provides good alternate ways to go make up for mistakes. You can probably only save yourself like that once or twice however, so good planning is critical.

Bad stuff: No theme. While I didn't care about it while planning, if it WAS there and well integrated, it would make this game into something even better. Setup is terrible. If this becomes a regular, I will seriously consider a box insert.

Build and expand your empire across the map by terraforming lands into your home terrain. I no longer enjoy teaching the game for the return. 

PROS
-Variable start abilities (14 races available).
-Lots of replay value.
-Minimal luck.
-Alternate paths to victory.
-Lots of important decisions to make. 
-Great artwork and components.

CONS
-Game is difficult to teach; there should be better summary guides/ player aids. The one included is terrible. 
-Game is not intuitive.
-Empty theme.
-Minimal player interaction (mostly solitary).
-The cult track is separate from the main board, which adds more confusion for new players. Also makes it seem less important and looks like the game is incomplete. 
-Bowls of power seem an unnecessary account keeping resource. Slows the game and could be implemented much better. 
-Forced cooperation to gain power/ cheaper buildings makes it more difficult to expand (thus longer game). Also a hard concept for new players and makes little thematic sense.  
-No catch up mechanism. 
-Runaway leader: game is a puzzle that can be solved quickly and the winner determined early, making the latter half of the game boring.

This probably isn't the most fair review since I had trouble understanding and following the game. Overall, it was difficult to follow everything, dry, and mechanics seemed unthematic and a bit gamey (like the magic wheel). Also, more complex than I'd like I think. I generally prefer euros, but some just go over my head, and this was one of them. I would like to try this again though.

Somehow, Terra Mystica's messy web of obscure rules, weird currencies, Victory Point salad, and questionable balance manages to coalesce into a deep and varied strategy game. It's so complex that it's a pain to try to keep everything in mind as you play, but it succeeds in wringing value out of that complexity.

Approved.

RATING: 10
A perfect ten, now in my top ten.

There are so many things that I like. Just to mention a few of them:
- No luck, no hidden information.
- 14 different fantasy races that with small difference in their special rules allow for a great difference in playing the game. Besides allowing a huge variability and replayability, this attracts family and friends alike because the theme comes through.
- Variable set-up further enriches the replayability.
- Strategic deep decisions, with a lot of choices, some subtler ones shoving themselves with more plays.
- The way magic power is managed allows to recover from tactical mistakes as a consequence speeding up play (e.g. one coin is missing because of miscalculation, just transform a magic power in a coin and nothing is lost).
- Original in so many ways. I like very much the above mentioned use of magic power, besides so many other things. Maybe some other mechanisms have already been seen, but they are integrated in such a new way that this game is very different from what I have played before. There are games that are milestones, and this is one of them: in the story of boardgaming there is a point in time that divides the flux, before and after Terra Mystica, this is how much it is different IMHO.
- There is interaction without screwing up. I had read negative comments about the game being too much a solitary thing. I don't agree with this at all, it is a game where one has to watch very carefully at what the others are doing and react if one wants to win.

I can't imagine a gamer not liking Terra Mystica, unless he/she has some aversion for Euro games and stops beforehand trying to like or even trying to play it.

Very recommended!

RATING: 9
The most bland-looking game of all times (which may be an exaggeration) reveals itself as an outstanding strategic game. No, there is no theme at all here, but you won't mind it while you're struggling with every single step you take, brilliantly creating new strategies to defeat your friends. While you play the game, only the board matters.

It's not a 10, however, for one reason: the cult board. The main board feels so intense and so amazing that it makes me cry every time I remember that I have to divert my attention from it towards that ugly little appendix there.

RATING: 10
I have played it 4 times in real life and have 3 games going on terra.snellman.net and it is absolutely wonderful.  The theme gives it nice color and it does make some sense for the races the abilities are attributed to but what this game comes down to is the amazing amount of directions you can take your strategy, coupled with the randomized bonuses that really are the drivers of how you should play a race.  It's easy to learn even in it's complexity because it is elegantly designed.

Once you've played it a couple of times you will learn how to pick your race based on the round bonuses and available pass Bonuses.  I don't think it would be possible to win if you aren't using these bonuses to your advantage.  Each race has minor tweaks that make the timing of what you build for that race different.  One race you might go straight for the stronghold but another you might go Sanctuary.  One you might want to upgrade your dig right away, others you never will.  So it really depends.

On top of all that, every turn and every round you are faced with figuring out how to maximize the turn with your resources and with some luck, getting more power bonuses and not having critical things you need stolen from you right before your turn.  It's really a game of infinite possibilities and it's just beautiful to look at and has lots of texture to feel as well.  I see why it is the #4 game and it will be my next game purchase.  Also I love that it can be played with only 2 people.  Often games like this are min of 3. 

LOVE IT!  Perfect score.

My favorite game and has been for over 2 years.  I really love how the game guides your strategy (with the round markers) for a different feel each time.  I also love how even when the markers don't feel like they will play to your race's strength there are other options and excelling is still possible.  The variable powers is one of the greatest parts - and a big reason I replay this game so often.

Es uno de los juego que más me ha sorprendido este año. Aunque se editó el año pasado no había tenido la oportunidad de probarlo hasta hace unos meses. 

Me gusta como combina las diferentes mecánicas entre sí (algunas novedosas) e integra todos los elementos para que quede un juego redondo y equilibrado.

En cuanto a los aspectos negativos, es muy difícil hacer un juego asimétrico y que todo esté en equilibrio al ciento por ciento. Puede ser que alguna raza esté un poco por encima de otra. Aunque la verdad es que creo que puede ser que no he dado con la forma de jugar para las razas que veo más débiles.

No me gusta que no hayan pensado en alguna manera de jugarlo decentemente a 2 jugadores o incluso en solitario. El precio debería de incluir este "pequeño" detalle. Un ejemplo de esto es el Hansa Teutónica, en una cara del tablero 2 y 3 jugadores y en la otra 4 y 5. Es sencillo.

En todo caso para mi es un juego que sin lugar a duda me compraría.

The factions in Terra Mystica aren't equally balanced, (some definitely need a few plays before their strategy can be understood), but there are so many that players can choose to play a game involving only the strongest factions or the weakest and then play will equalize.

A minor quibble that might get addressed in a later edition of the game involves the game board. The back of the board has a the game's name and some artwork from the box in full-color on it. It would have been nice if this surface had instead been used to create an alternate map to provide further play variation.

Excellent deeply strategic game.  I want to own this game, but with other deep, long playing time games I do own never finding their way to my table...it would be hard to justify this purchase...but I may anyway...I did!

14 different races, with their own special abilities, try to establish their colonies in this barren world.  You have to terraform the terrain tiles to a terrain that your race can live on.  As you build your town for every building you build you get an extra bonus income, sometimes a special ability.  When improving a building you need to remove the older building, so you lose that bonus, the way this feature is handled reminded me of Hansa Teutonica, a game I love.  You also are vying for gods' favors (cults) and managing your purple power discs.

The game is really deep and lasts a bit long, but it is great fun.  After my second play I am eager to keep playing.  This game is really fun, deep, and has just enough to scare away non-gamers marking this my top 'gamer's games'.

A sparkling game, but my appreciation outstrips my actual enjoyment of it by a good margin. Yes, the game is fathoms deep; yes, the variation in starting setup and faction abilities offers extraordinary replay value; yes, even the artwork is gorgeous. But resources are so pinched, largely because upgrading beyond a humble dwelling requires losing a previously constructed building. I cannot love such a miserly game, especially when the theme, though present in some attenuated intellectual sense, is in no way palpable.

RATING: 9
exciting complex development game. the hansa teutonica style development of taking cubes off the board and revealing better abilities has an important new twist: here buildings are taken off the development board, but when a building is replaced by another(upgrade) on the main board it goes back to the development board. The effect is that if no further development happens until the next round then a resource that is revealed on the development board becomes available and now there is less of another resource that is now covered by the building taken back from the main board.
(there are 14 different development boards, there is a special ability on each that can be exploited by development and require different strategies for players to pursue)
the development itself is forked and includes 5 different buildings, and it can provide 4 different resources that can be used to develop terrain, build buildings that form cities on the main board, upgrade water routes (to allow more distant building) and terraforming abilities on the development board and helping climb higher on 4 cult tracks.
building next to an opponent's building could provide a resource to the opponent if (s)he elects to give up victory points - this was an element that vaguely reminded me of Kaivai.
there are 6 rounds. each round the players pick from "bonus" tiles (1 out of 3 a slight resemblance to Puerto Rico), that provide additional resources or victory points.
at game set-up round cards(replayability) selected (6 of 8). for each round they show available scoring opportunities and cult track climbing bonus resources for that round.
cities that form from 4 neighboring buildings are scored in-game.
at the end of the game continuous network of buildings of players are compared and the three largest are scored. each cult track also score three of the highest climbers.
I enjoyed the game, it has the elements of a nice meaty euro with enough player interaction without too much confrontation. The game is best with 5 fast, experienced players (should play well under 3 hours) , it is also great with 4 and good with 3. I would avoid playing it as a 2 player game. Avoid AP players.

Building euro with asymmetric player powers. The asymmetric player powers are by far the most interesting thing about this game, as they inform players' playstyles. Otherwise it seems to be a solid but not outstanding build-economy-and-buildings game.

The power mechanic seems to be needless innovation, although it looks nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's got resource management, which is probably the main push of the game. You need to maintain a balance between your different resource generations and getting your higher value buildings out. It's sort of area control, since you are competing with other players for space on the board, but not being isolated benefits you, so it encourages a certain amount of conflict and cooperation.  The different player powers really do make the game more interesting since there are many ways the powers can interact with each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.65
What I love most about this game are the mechanisms. The terraforming and the power points system are the original things, but the best part is how the mechanisms interact and the effect they create. The art and graphic design are very nice and the gameplay feels faster than it really is. Also, the races are very different, the game is really asymetric.

Playing Terra Mystica requires a balance between strategic long term planning and tactic optimization of each turn. There's some degree of randomness caused mainly by the actions of the other players: The initial start points and expansion of the rest of the players will affect you greatly; but also, the order of the turn tiles will benefit some races more than others.

Overall, it didn't seem that complex to me. I thought the competition for spots and actions was going to be more tight and the decisions much harder. There's indirect interaction, the kind of interaction that spices up the game, but doesn't allow players to gang upon someone; still, it will not be enough interaction for some players.

People complain about the turn markers dictating your strategy. I don't agree, they offer you some points in order to deviate or adapt your strategy. This is part of the cool stuff about this game.


Some things I didn't like:
-> The map has real balance issues. Some terrain types have very easy expansion points and some others will make life very difficult. And this seems to be a VERY IMPORTANT issue.
-> Snowball effect. If you fall behind early, you will be out of the win race for good.


Maybe I will improve my rating if the things I dislike prove to be less serious than I think.

The undefeatable champion of Spiel 2012.

Dennis Lohausen has made an amazing job on the user interface: Absolutely everything (actions, prices, conversions, tech tree, special powers, starting resources, etc.) is shown on the boards using very clear graphical presentations and in an easily digestible way. (Except for the end game resource scoring and the 1-step priest track action; Also, the action summary card seems like a rush job since it's not even grouped by the type of resource needed.)

All these visual cues are definitely needed, since the game is very complex and has lots of details that are easy to forget. I would recommend not trying the game with people who tend to do rules mistakes on first playings. Even though in this game, forgetting something usually punishes the ignorant player only, and leaves others unscathed.

Rating is very likely to rise.

Great game! High replayability, zero randomness, so many decisions to take in not so long game (second game took us 2 hours with 4 players). Rating may rise with future plays. Love it.

Edit: 7 games later and rating goes down to 8. TM is still a very good game but not as deep as I thought at first.

Edit: There is no need to play TM if I have Gaja Project (much improvement over TM). Rating down to 6.

Scatolone pesante dovuto ai grezzi 'edifici' di legno, tabellone non particolarmente curato o accattivante. Così si presenta Terra Mystica. Poi si aprono le plance delle diverse razze (14 tipi) che sono studiate molto bene. Perfette anche le illustrazioni che rendo immediata la comprensione dei poteri e il gioco risulta completamente indipendente dalla lingua. Le razze asimmetriche con poteri e setup differenti rendono il gioco molto longevo e originale. Ogni razza dovrà terraformare i territori adiacenti rendendoli abitabili per la propria popolazione. Il bilanciamento tra le razze così differenti e le diverse strategie per fare punti vittoria rendono il gioco molto vario e coinvolgente. L'interazione apparentemente assente è invece forte sia nel piazzamento iniziale che nella scelta dei favori...  Un gioco profondo dalla durata non eccessiva che necessita di buona pianificazione. A mio avviso il miglior gioco del 2012.

RATING: 7.5
A clever game, for sure, with lots to manage and keep tabs on. But it doesn't leap up and grab me in the same way that it seems to have done with others. It doesn't help in being an amalgam of borrowed mechanics with barely anything original of its own. I'm happy to play it a few times and experiment with the various races. But each one seems to have a pre-set strategy, and the lack of direct conflict does little to prevent that.

Quickly has become my two apartment mates favorite. The smooth, intuitive flow along with the way the time just seems to fly by when playing has caused our apartment to be lost for hours inside this game. So many mechanics synchronized together so well deserves the universal acclaim this game has received. What more can I say?

This is my favorite game. It has so many strategic layers, and though it may not be as technically "deep" as TI:3 or some other heavy wargames, it has a lot more personal strategic element to it. How are you, personally, going to play all of the cogs correctly this game to come out ahead? All the pieces are laid out for everyone to see. There is no hidden information factor. Thats what I find so impressive about this game design. It is so elegant - a game with nothing hidden - everything is right there for each other player to see and figure out. It is Chess^2.

RATING: 8.9
Score after first two games. Score will be updated later. Rised to 8.3 after third play. I lost 2 out of my 3 games. 

Score increased to 8.7 after 5th play. I lost 4 out of 5. Become second in 3 of my loses. What a great game. Nearly perfect game design. Its like a modern time chess. It has a great community and online play & tournaments/leagues.

Score increased 8.8 after 7th play (4 online-3 offline). Now I got 3 wins:)

Score increased to 9.0 after tons of online play, online tournaments and leagues. What a great pure strategy game. Huge replayablity. Not very complex rules. My first score of 9.

Score updated to 9.1 after maybe 60th play, (50 online). This game is awesome!

Score decreased to 8.9. Maybe it is not that much fun. It is pure strategy game. To pass 9 it should be also very fun to play.

Latest update : I still play game. Especially online tournaments. I completed 62 games online. I won 18 of them(29%), at 25 of games I become 2nd (41%). All played 4 players. This game is best at 4 players. Even you are better than other players you can lose a game. A bit luck and player reaction is involved, every decision can change result in game easily. These are not so bad. My online rating is 1132 after 62 game. I expect it should be around 1200. I was a bit unlucky at lots of game. I am sure I will be 1200 rating soon. I will edit here then.

Edit 28/3/16 : I finally got rating which I deserved after 90th play. My current rating is 1217. Maybe 1250s in future but I do not deserve 1300s. Anyway my rating is not important of course at online terra mystica. This game is simply best.

Wonderful and perfect mechanics! Game flows smoothly. Very nice the idea of different races (which are really different when playing).
However, after 5 plays the games still seems too abstract for my taste, running towards victory seems to be more bound with buidling cities and building at the right moment rather than building up a woderful civilization. Players' interaction is only modest.

[i]- The first thing you get is your own faction to play, each with a very distinctive set of powers/ play style.
- This game is heavy, but it does not take long to understand how the game works.
- There are a lot of variables in the game which will make each game a unique experience. 
- There is so much you want to do, but your actions are limited really forcing you to focus on how you are going to score points.
This particular aspect of the game reminds me of Agricola and is something that I personally love in games.

I've loved every play of this so far and my older daughter is getting to the point were I think she could handle playing it. If it played well with 2 it would already be in my collection, as of now I'm probably going to probably wait. I'd like to get a play in with my kids before buying it, maybe I can get a game in with my kids and Mat.[/i]

A dozen plays in, the replay value is still very high. The more you play, the more you see what others are trying to do and the more you start to try and mess with them. Yes, it's hard to completely hose the other guy, but Terra Mystica is more a game of paper cuts - make your opponent pay more / do something in a less effective manner enough times and by the end of the game you've gotten more bang for your buck.

Wonderful design. Shines with 5, which is a not insignificant feat.

Catan with magic. And variable player powers. And no dice. So not really Catan at all. The strategy for this game is still shrouded in mystery to me; it's not intuitive or obvious but I'm sure that's offensive to some people. Turns are fast because they consist of one action but that one decision can be a major contributor to AP. I love the artwork and the many different races and powers the game provides, adding replay value. While Terra Mystica didn't blow my mind, I didn't hate it so much that I never wanted to play again.

The rules take a bit of explaining but after that the game usually goes smoothly even with new players. Although you are taking over territory, upgrading buildings and creating towns it felt much more like a Euro game to me than a civ-lite game, perhaps because of the lack of direct conflict, but a very good Euro game. Trying different factions and thinking about how to exploit the each faction's ability more effectively gives the game considerable replayability for me.

When asked about a long and meaty euro, this is my number 1 preference.
This game has a lot to think about, a lot of different strategies with 14 races and variable round objectives,
without being overwhelming.

It has a LOT of rules to be taken into account, althoug I think it's just the number, as each of them makes sense and it's quite simple on its own.

No theme at all, but glad it's not the usual medieval merchants.

Had a good initial play.  Only played with two players, both new to game.  Game certainly seems like it will be better with 4-5 players, also a bit more understanding of what strategy should be.  I can see the potential here, but that potential was not realized in first play.  I love asymmetry and the rules to this feel pretty streamlined.

A mini-review I posted to https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/111229977945579240171/stream/7962fa50-b545-49b3-92b5-c8e579218f06

Okay so who wants to know all about Terra Mystica? Here's the straight poop.

First off, what you probably already know: asymmetrical area-control cube pusher. Very euro-style. Indirect interaction, largely in the form of thwarting one another's efforts while grinding out solutions for your turn. There's a fantasy theme that isn't pasted on, but it's also not really deeply integrated into the game either. Two to 5 players, allegedly 30 minutes @ player (not tonight; five of us took 3.5 hours to play).

Here's what you don't probably already know: all that asymmetry adds up to a really deep exploration of strategies and tactics. So far I have played 3 of the 14 races that come with the base set: The nomads and witches in a couple 2p games, and the much-hated giants in our 5p game tonight. Each game felt substantially different. 

The learning game is a set starting map setup, with pre-chosen scoring tiles and pre-chosen bonus tiles. These tiles are where all the replayability and "randomness" lies -- all other information is 100% open, which may make you bonkers or it may be awesome. Dunno. 

Each turn, your race gets a bunch of different assets: money, workers, priests and power. Power is interesting, and it's not like...magical power, not really. It's more like, I don't know, social influence maybe. Hard to say. It's the least themed element of the game and also the most interesting: Everyone has 12 little purple chits indicating their total power, and it gets cycled between three different "bowls", until it settles into the third and final bowl, where it can be used and returned to bowl 1. What the fuck are these bowls? What the fuck is this power? Doesn't matter; the actual economy of it is very clever, and forces interesting decisions all game long.

On your turn, you get one action. You have a little menu with eight options, but many of those eight options themselves have subsets of options. For example, there's a set of eight sub-actions that can be taken only once each round, which is why you want to be first player: first come first served. I think on any given turn, I was evaluating between five and twelve actual choices. I'd put this in the "pretty heavy" category.

Scoring happens throughout the game, according to the order of "scoring tiles" you drew to start the game. You get paid for building certain kinds of buildings, or terraforming the terrain into something more hospitable to your people. I think there are other things that pay you but I can't remember what they are off the top of my head. So that shapes a lot of play right there: the turn were you get 5 veeps for building your biggest buildings, expect to see most people angling to do just that.

There are other scoring opportunities as well, mostly keyed into "cult favors" you earn by building sacred buildings (temples and your sanctuary). I think a couple races have bonus scoring as well. Like...the witches, I think, get paid extra points for completing towns. Why do witches want to build towns? Who knows! Some of the thematic decisions are head-scratchers.

At the end of the game, you have some more scoring opportunities: biggest contiguous civilizations, and control over each of the four elemental cults, and leftover money you might not have spent. It's all pretty straightforward and like I said, there is no hidden information. 

I thought the game was pretty fun, in a very euro kind of way. There's very little drama to the game, no sudden surprise swings or bold incursions. It's super-thinky, especially as the game moves into its final round or two. Probably the most "fun" plays are where you thwart someone's delicate plans by taking the last town, or the one opportunity for money, or whatever. I think this is definitely in the category of games that a very small, very very hardcore group will delve into so deeply that it may cease to be "fun" for more casual players (like the hardcore Through the Ages folks, for example). 

In terms of design, it feels very much evolutionary and not revolutionary. I can see signs of all kinds of prior designs hidden throughout the game. It all works very well! The materials are clear, the procedures are unambiguous. There are a few dumb little edge cases you have to memorize having to do with individual racial abilities, and I do not love that. It's also the kind of game where each of the three rather simple "phases" of play actually require you review lots and lots and lots of fiddly little steps, and it's very easy to forget one here and there. It was never game-breaking but was still annoying to know we had probably fucked things up several times.

I'd rank this one a very solid 7, possibly moving up to an 8 due to all the exploratory opportunities. I am very much looking forward to digging deeper into it.

RATING: 7
A game I can admire, and appreciate why many people rate it as high as they do. It's a simple game of expanding your territory and building on your territories. And then it gets complicated because there's a ton of ways to go about it. Each building provides a different type of income. The twist they pull is that to build a new building you must upgrade it from an older building. You get the new type of income, but the old building goes back into your supply and you lose the type of income it was previously providing. There are multiple currencies, each used for different things, so losing worker income means less buildings, losing power income means less spells, etc. So you're trading off what currencies you want to earn in. And of course there's a ton of ways to score points, so it becomes an efficiency game ... if I do this, then I get this, but I no longer get that, so I won't be able to do that. And you cycle through a bunch of options to determine which nets you just one more VP (end-game), or provides you better options during the mid-game. So don't play with AP'ers, it'll drive you mad. While I like having a ton of options to explore, efficiency decisions for minor gains aren't a lot of fun, and neither is the downtime they induce for your opponents. The theme is tacked on and doesn't provide an edge, making this a pure abstracty Euro, so while I'd rate it higher for the game space it provides, a few issues for me give it a slightly lower rating. While I wouldn't mind playing if it was at the table, I'm not itching to.

Mix Agricola, Catan, and a Feld game together, add in handfuls of variable player powers, top it off with a fantasy theme, and the resulting game might feel like Terra Mystica. Steep learning curve. Much replayability. 20 to 30 minutes per player.

As quality a production this is, as beautiful and well-designed this is, the theme/story doesn't come out enough for me, making this feel more mechanically abstract than fun.

einmal gespielt - nie wieder! Dieses Spiel war der Beginn meiner zunehmenden Abneigung gegen überkomplizierte victory-point-salad-Eurogames.
Manche bezeichnen dieses Spiel als episch- das einzig epische an diesem Spiel ist die Spieldauer und das Regelwerk. 
Unter episch stelle ich mir etwas mit Thema vor. Dieses Spiel ist aber völlig abstrakt, da helfen auch auf die einzelnen Spielpläne aufgedruckte "Rassen" nichts. Unterm Strich schiebe ich nur Holzwürfel hin und her.

Habe noch nie ein solches Spiel erlebt, bei dem es NICHTS gab, was mir Spass gemacht hätte...mehr Arbeit als Spiel

After years of hype, what a disappointment. Feels like something developed in 1998, that has long since been superceded by better designs.  Found nothing here that was exciting. Races were not easy to follow or learn, nor were they balanced. Tedious choices. Many aspects of this game done much better in other games.  Reminded me of a much more convoluted, and much less fun, 'Kingdom builder'. Luckily, I only wasted $15 on the app, and not the actual game.

One of my favorite games.  I like it because it is 100% strategy. No dice to see what resources you have. You decide what to build and how to play.  A lot of variety to the game. The only downside I can think of is some of the races are much harder to play than others.

My first play of Terra Mystica was hampered by a difficulty in understanding the game-play.  The game is heavily reliant upon symbols and it took me half way through the game to catch on to the symbols and to get the sense of the game.  While there was about the game I found interesting, I can't say that anything about it was compelling.  I could not get a sense of what my opponents special skills were, and it was just a game I played in more of a fog than I have experienced in a while.  I would definitely play again now that I understand the game play.

Very good game!  I'm quite pleased to finally have it hit the table.  There is quite a bit of depth of strategy, as well as replayability, with the variable races.  Looking forward to the next play-through.

This is a great, typical German game. It has lots of variation since there are many more different races than you play each time. 

Lots of combinations make a complex game, but still quite easy rules.

I love the fact that it is so scaleable. Since you want to be near to each other and it's difficult to expand far away the game gets as crowded with three players as with five (you just don't use all of the board). We have even tried playing it with six players which works ok. I have made an addition to the map for 6-7 players, but haven't tried it yet. 

I have had to up my rating quite a bit. This is a game I've played a lot lately, and never grow tired of.

In Terra Mystica you choose from one of 14 factions and you terraform, build, expand and upgrade your buildings on hex terrain map along side other players (factions) while also trying to compete (climb) on 4 cult tracks (religion). For that on your disposal you have 4 different resources: money, workers, priests and power. 
Power is quite fresh way of resource collecting and management. You have 3 rondels. When you get power you move power first from rondel 1 to 2 and then from rondel 2 to 3. When you spend power you are spending it only from rondel 3 back to rondel 1. You are getting power actually by building close to other players among other things. So game awards building close to other players.
Game is played over 6 rounds. Every round has randomly selected round tile with bonus points for some specific thing you can do and bonus for specific cult track position at the end of round. There are also bonus tiles (special actions, extra income,...) picked every round after passing, favor tiles which you get if you build "religious" buildings and there are tiles for founding cities which is automatic when your connected territory expands to prescribed size.
When you learn rules for this game it may seem a bit daunting but after you start playing everything is quite intuitive with the great help of visual representation of board and player boards. Actually game is quite simple in what you can do which is essentially: terraform and build (expanding your territory or starting new settlement), upgrade one of your building and going higher on cult track with a help of your resources which you get through also simple ways. But heaviness and replayability of it lies in 14 different factions who have small differences between each other regarding special rules but great difference in playing the game. You have to take advantage of your faction characteristics to win the game while being aware what other factions in game weaknesses and strengths are and how to take advantage of randomly selected round and bonus tiles.
Interaction in this game is how i like it it's there but not totally "screw up your friend" kind.
Components are great and game is visually stunning. 
If you like euro games, just go buy this game.
The best game of 2013 and one of the best games off all times.

RATING: 7
A very good game - some fairly simple mechanics to grasp but so many different strategic choices to make. One of our group's favourites.

On the down side - it is possible to make mistakes early on that can completely remove you from the running even thought you have another hour's gameplay left. It is very easy to run low on power/priests/workers and find your options severely limited.

Some of the races are very hard to get the best out of too. Not as balanced as they first appear no matter what all those 'experts' who have played 100 games claim.

I also think I'd prefer less ways to score but more complex interaction between the various elements.

It isn't very combative either - there isn't a whole lot you can really do to mess with other players if they know what they are about.

Housekeeping and adding of scores is messy too.

Overall though, this game has a nice feel and the great range of races gives us lots to go back and try out. Plenty of learning too, which is mostly fun.

RATING: 8.5
There are a lot of rules due to the variety of things you can build or upgrade but it is all on your player board so once you understand how to build it becomes clear after a few turns. There are a lot of paths to victory, but building many items will lead to more resources and help you build an engine to be able to have large locations (which gives bonuses). Very interesting game that needs to be played many times to learn the different strategies. Not a lot of interaction, but you need to watch the others as they move up some power tracks and the size of their cities since those are scored at the end of the game.

One of my favourite euro games. It has everything - worker placement, several different types of resources, asymmetric factions, point salad, and some interesting mechanics for a territory control game that both rewards and punishes building too close to another player.

But, a lot of rules, a lot to get your head around. I'd need to read the rules again if I picked it up today.

This game kind of reminds me of a rip off of Trajan and Settlers. The theme is pasted on and the overall graphic design is quite European (in a negative way)... I must profess that although the game is quite well designed is one which is grossly overrated.

This is a building game in which you're trying to build the various buildings on your player board to increase your income, Hansa Teutonica style.  The higher-level buildings have increased costs and require you to replace lower-level buildings, which will send the lower-level buildings back to your board and thus increase your income in some ways, but decrease it in others.  The game encourages players to get in each other's way, as there are significant bonuses for being next to an opponent.  Turning this all into points is the tricky part, because while some of your points may come from having an impressive city during endgame scoring, most of your points will come from performing certain actions during certain turns, taking roles that may not be as beneficial income-wise, or using your special ability.  Oh yeah, and there are 14 distinct races each with their own special ability, that will really define how you play the game.  There's a lot going on here, and I love every bit of it.

RATING: 9
Rather heavy euro game with really straightforward mechanisms. Trying to connect 1 and 1 though is the tough part. I feel like this game can be best described as Kingdom Builder meets Small World with a dash of Puerto Rico and a scoop of Settlers of Catan. 

I really like how different all the races are and I feel like you could easily get 14 plays out of the game without breaking a sweat and that's not even playing each race more than once. Lots to explore and seems to play better with more players. Really want to dig deep into this one.

I see this game rising in rating for me. It's good but it has a ton of potential that I don't think I've even remotely seen. I've already tried a couple completely different strategies and all have seemed to have done fairly well. Hopefully I can bring this week after week to FFG to get in more plays of it.

Includes 4 Stadtmarker promo tiles and Meeple Realty insert.

It is not really a crossbreed between Settlers of Catan and Hansa Teutonica. But it is the closest thing that I come to Think of. A dry, strange, awkward game. "Dont-forget-this-round-that-you-also-can-score-this-and-that" kind of game. Generic fantasy setting. On the other hand it is very hands-on. You build this and that, you transform this into that and convert this building and form Towns. Seeing your Little empire beginning to sprawl on the map is gratifying. Beautiful bits and pieces. Good first game expericence. We will see if this initial rating is to high or low..

Tentative rating after one play. It´s a very taxing game and I got one of the more complex races to start with - I only started with one dwelling (Chaos Magicians) and struggled the whole game, will update my rating if I play it again. Also, it felt a bit too abstract to me. Even eurogames should have some theme integration and this game does not have much.

Great Game. It is absolutely fascinating how the only slight differentes between the races change the way to play them. There are so many interactions to discover which grants long lasting fun. 

And it works well with two players. The discount on only one building forces the players to stick together on the same map that is used with any player number. Very elegant :-)

Okay, nothing particularly wrong with this game, but it is a bit heavy on 'stuff going on' that without it scratching a particular itch I'd rather skip it.

RATING: 7.5
Terra mystica is what most would consider a "Heavy" euro game. I've played it quite a few times and with every play you develop new strategies to win victory points, but your strategy will mainly depend on the race you use and the turn tokens (selected randomly). Learning to play isn't that difficult, however, I highly recommend playing Catan, Puerto Rico and Agricola before getting your hands on TM. What I dislike the most and the reason I'm giving the game a 9 is that setup time is pretty long due to the amount of tokens and ziplocks you need to open.

EDIT 10/04/2015: After several plays with the same group we have started losing interest in the game, it does not have the same staying power as other games. Mainly due to the set up time.

I didn't understand this game at first.  It seemed to me to be a city-building game or a resource management game, and initially it looked like nothing more than multiplayer solitaire...until you get good at it.

There are in essence two types of scoring in this game - in-game and end-game scoring.  In-game scoring occurs during your turn as you accomplish tasks related to your player board, the role tokens, and the turn-based rewards.  Endgame scoring rewards long-term investments for largest contiguous bloc of building, towns erected, and favor chart advancement.  

All of our early games were determined by in-game scoring.  Players who were efficient scored gobs of points, and while they also excelled at endgame scoring, the game was decided long before those were awarded.  We all struggled just to get our own things done, and that dominated our planning.  We barely looked at each other except two of us obviously needed the same hexes.

After we understood the game, all of the games are determined by end-game scoring.  We finally came to understand that the game is all about who controls which hexes, blocking each other, and controlling pivotal hexes.  In-game scoring flattened, and the games started to look like train games...building networks (long routes indirectly connected and foursomes directly connected) and investing in stock (the favor tracks, which pay out critical VPs at the end and dividends in the form of power in-game). 

There's nothing "multiplayer solitaire" about this game.  If you're not actively attacking the formations of other players to prevent them from growing their networks, you haven't learned how to play yet. 

Top game.  Raising my rating to 9.

This is a very good resource management game. The asymmetry of the different races is not typical of such games, but makes this very interesting. The mechanisms that promote interaction among players make for very tough choices. I love the game with 3 and 4. I haven't tried it with 5, but I think the downtime might be a bit excessive. Overall, this might trend toward a 9, but the min/maxing necessary on the last turn kind of drags the game down to a grind instead of providing a climactic finish.

Really, really good. I still get rules specific to each faction wrong, but it's still just so satisfying to watch your towns grow, keep one eye on the cult track, one on the turn based boni, and one on the other players to make sure they won't build in a way that blocks your development, but also not leave you isolated. Can go quite long with the type of player who actually wants to run the math each turn.

A pure resource management game, with 4 types of resources that can be converted into each other, one more flexibly than others. Some actions give you immediate VP in some round but not otherwise, other actions give you better resource conversion rates, other actions save you future resource expenditure. 
It's all rather abstract, arbitrary, and not very realistic (like converting deserts to swamps). No feeling at end that I developed a civilisation. The mechanics are good (although not original) but that's all: going through the usual motions, no theme. Plus, it took us 4h, incl. setup, rules explanation and cleanup. Not a game for me, sorry.

Wonderful, complex web of resource management and choices, so many choices. Nothing is done in a simple, elegant way, but everything offers multiple directions.

Q: So what do I get again, when I build a temple?
A: Whatever you want: Pick one of twelve different bonus tiles.

Q: So how do I get money again?
A: Well, in one of six different ways...

Even gaining victory points depends on your race, the turn, and bonus tiles. And they're different every game.

There's no limit to how many or how few actions you can take: simply continue until your resources are spent, or pass early and carry everything over to next round. A lot of choices, few restrictions.

There's plenty of competition, but also lots of ways to simply happily build without people getting in your way. It's always possible to advance your position, but to see what to do when, takes skill and experience.

Because the basis is building dwellings and upgrading them to trading posts, to gain the resources you need to keep building, the game is not actually all that hard. You don't have to focus on everything, and your race and the turn bonus will give you some direction on what to do. There are also plenty of 'accidental bonuses'. You may build a trading post for the extra money, but you also get extra power which gives you the option to maybe build a bridge. Oh, and you're one step closer to a city, which gives you more bonuses. There's always plenty to do.

Lots of freedom, lots of options, building and expanding without many restrictions or frustrations, and you're still heavily invested in what your opponents are doing. And every game will be totally different.

Recommended!

Terra Mystica is a fantastic game. The design is elegant and simple to follow. The game-play is tight, fair and fun. I really enjoy the fantasy setting.
The content of the box is great, with numerous wooden components. 

This game might be a little daunting to people not used to this kind of board-game, but the elegant design makes it easy to follow once you have the board setup before you.

I highly recommend this game.

Favourite game at this moment. 

It's one of those games where you can always find ways to get points.  If someone builds where you were going to build then you will most likely get power, which will then benefit you on your turn.  

There are bonus tiles that you get to choose from each round, the same person can't hoard the same bonus tile for the whole game either which evens the playing field.

My favourite game to this point was Agricola, but I think that taken that spot for now.  We'll see if the rating changes after a few plays.

RATING: 7.1
Rating after 3 plays. Game has dropped from a 9 to a 7.5 for me. Although a basically good, thinky, strategic game. This game suffers from the downfall of all games with variable player powers; it creates far too many questions that aren't addressed in the rules. When these questions are addressed by the designers in the rules forums it has led to inconsistencies between the factions. (Ex. Halflings CAN overpay shovels to gain terraforming VP bonus; Dwarves/Fakirs CAN NOT tunnel/fly to a space that is adjacent to currently occupied space for additional VP -- both pay additional resources to do something but I have to REMEMBER which faction can do the illogical thing to gain VP.) I prefer a game that doesn't require me to remember arbitrary rules about who can do what different in what situation. I sat down to play a Euro not a thematic game.

Bottom Line: Increased Factions = Reduced Elegance

I am also not convinced that certain factions are not more powerful than others. I have played three games with players of equal experience. The green faction has won all three games (2 Witches/1 Auren). The green faction was played by a different player in each game! If you look at the board, it appears green has the opportunity to start with a much stronger board position than any other faction. 

Good game but not great. Luster will soon fade. Doubt it will be remembered 5 years from now.

[floatleft][ImageID=1450866][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
As of late I have subscribed to the Cult of the Old. I make very little effort to follow whats trending at Essen, nor do I go out of my way to seek out the new and exciting games to try. I figure if a game is worthy of my consideration someone else will bring it to my attention. Terra Mystica (TM) is one such game that was off my radar but was recommended to me by someone else. I knew nothing about this game before sitting down to play it, but I sure am glad that I did. TM clicked for me instantly because the rules made sense, the mechanism interactions seemed amazingly fluid, and strategies appeared to be boundless. Right out of the gate TM is high in my ratings and I could easily see it becoming one of my favorite games. I look forward to more plays of this game.

[floatright][ImageID=1450485][/floatright][b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
The thing that really sets TM apart from other games is the Power system and the Bowls of Power. Having magic in a game isn't anything new but the way TM handles gathering the Power is just so damned inventive. I really like the "staging" of the power between bowls where power is only usable in the 3rd bowl but you can burn power from bowl 2 for a quick boost at the loss of overall total power. It's freaking brilliant.

The best twist of this game is that players gain power by building adjacent to each other. This basically encourages people into their own mutually assured destruction. If you want power you need to build adjacent to your opponents but that is a double edged sword because you are restricting your ability to expand easily and you are also giving your adjacent opponents power in return. 

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I really dislike the rule book. Its good for learning but trying to look up something specific can be difficult.

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
I know I love this game but with the infrequency that I get to actually play this its hard to internalize the rules. Despite only getting this to the table once in a blue moon I have bumped my rating to a 10. The TM app that just came out might help with keeping the game fresh in my mind.

RATING: 8
Impressive resource management game where all the mechanics flow smoothly into the other mechanics. It scales really well being just as fun with 2 as it is with 5. I love the dynamic where you both want to be next to your opponents to benefit by taking power from their constructions, and you want to be far away from them so you can have enough room to build and expand. Each player board has an option of two different factions to play, which gives the game a ton of replayability. Unfortunately, to play the game well, you really need to have already played your faction once before, and on top of that not all the factions are completely balanced with each other. This was sort of addressed in the expansion, where they expect players to bid for the faction board they want, which is a terrible solution as it requires people to be so familiar with the different strengths that it's not a reasonable amount of information for a new, or even not so new player to have on hand at the start of the game.

Gameplay wise, the game also suffers from forcing you to focus in on 'that thing' you are supposed to be doing with your faction, rather than explore your options creatively.

Die Tatsache, Meister über 14 Rassen zu sein (mit unterschiedlichen Fähigkeiten und Einschränkungen), die zudem noch ausgeglichen sind, finde ich fantastisch und interessant.

+ /- Many factions but not very well balanced
+/- No randomness (beginners will be crushed by xp players)
- Gameboard - world is only one and isn't modular
- Not easy to learn
- Not intuitive at first
-- Empty theme, very generic components wooden and hex map (Problems with identifying components)

Very good and complex game partly similar to puertorico or agricola but far more abstract in components and therefore not very intuitive and hard to learn as you would fight with components (what represents this generic shaped wooden piece?). Replayability is in trying new factions that each has 1-2 unique abilities passive or active but they do not feel balanced at all but game board is unfortunately only one and with fixed layout. This game would be great with better and more distinctive components.

So... I didn't think I would ever do that, but here I am, downgrading it to 9, and the reason is the expansion. The expansion has some really neat ideas, but the game already had an issue with balance and now it is even worse. We have two factions that are really above average, one of them is really OP, the quest for spades is diminished and the new board favors blue (factions that didn't need it anyway, with that stupid bonus card). The new scoring bonus are not redundant, but they certainly feel redundant... oh boy.

Yes, the modern game I've played the most is at best a 9 right now. I hope these issues are dealt with quickly.

Downgraded to 7.5 . Any game that needs people to metagame and gang up on the strongest player for any reason is a 7 for me. When the author suggested that you must actively play against some factions (Shapeshifters and Riverwalkers) to prevent them from winning an absurd amouth of times (like Ss 50% and Riverwalkers almost 40%), it was really disapointing.

That's it. I'm really disapointed.

Essentially a very Euro game that reminds me of Catan a tiny smidge, a little bit of Eclipse, and even an odd chunk of a few other area control games. It certainly is balanced, and it certainly... works for what it is.. But it's dry, has indirect conflict, boring asymmetry, and Tzolk'in style point soupish routes to VP, and as such I really can't imagine playing it again.

There are a lot of moving parts so the game takes a while to explain. However it was fairly easy to play in practice. It is a fairly long game, and I could see that analysis paralysis could be an issue. Most victory strategies are visible throughout the game ie what buildings score this turn, the elements, building towns especially the largest town. 

On your turn you have a multi-tier economy (workers/money/monks) to spend converting terrain to your liking and building various structures which provide income and other bonuses. The interesting part it the most structures are built as an upgrade, recycling the old structure. The other economy is power that has cyclical mechanic which accumulates and after a point can be burned as a substitute for other actions. This is a nice mechanic.

Game variability is provided by the races, I think I would prefer to randomly assign the cards rather than allow a player to always choose the same race. Not much in your face competition, it is mostly through cutting off town growth which is one of the victory points. The focus on the game is managing all the various currencies against your land and building development and what is being rewarded on that turn.

Ultimately this style of repetitive efficiency with all sorts of moving parts to hit the game turn targets just doesn't attract me.

Terra Mystica did not disappoint. This is an excellent game that I may up to a 10 with further plays. As is, this has everything I want in a game: Many paths to victory, variable set up, unique player powers leading to great replayability. I can't wait to play this more often and further explore this game. 

The one drawback I have is that is that it seems difficult to learn. The player boards and iconography are great, but mostly seem to assist with remembering. There isn't much in this game that intuitively happens, so the first game was pretty much grasping how everything works. This isn't really an issue for me as I plan to play my games plenty, but this isn't the sort of game I'd bother playing with anyone who just wanted to try it once and didn't plan to play ever again. 

Still, the actual gameplay on this one is great and well worth the time for Euro lovers to experience. There is an app rumored to be coming out in early 2017, and I am eagerly awaiting it now so I can play more regularly. 

UPDATE: Moving this from a 9 to a 10. It's well deserving of hitting that point. There is so much strategic depth in this game and so many ways the game can play out, all while being pretty easy to grasp after the first game. Not to mention the variable factions offer a lot of replayability as well.

What should be by right the most drab game is without a doubt one of the best puzzles assembled in a box. Intriguing, witty and quick, Terra Mystica might just be the ultimate Euro in the way it serves up a deliciously varied strategy game that has everything from end game bonuses to asymmetric player powers. It doesn't even take that long to play, and you won't notice the time passing as it absorbs you during your other player turns. Love how clever the concept of getting power is, which negates the rather tacked on cult board.

Thoughtful...  but as much I dislike randomness, I can't help but feel that this is an example of determinism done wrong.  
Once the starting pieces are placed, the rest of the game is calculable.   To prove this, someone even built an AI that can "solve" the game.
Add to this that playing just wasn't exciting.  I wasn't actively bored, but I felt no spark.  
In the future I would reach for Tzolk'in, Alchemists, Russian Railroads, Yokohama  or Scepter of Zavendor first.

RATING: 10
The biggest surprise of recent years and my boardgaming Grail. This is hands down the best medium-heavy eurogame I have ever played - an amazing, elegant design with huge replayability. And to think I almost passed on this one! Never bothered to try it, because I've heard opinions it's not so good with 2p (and that's how we play most of the time). But then got it as a Christmas gift and what a gift it was!

So what's so good in it? 1. Multiple factions and variable player powers. 2. Not too long. 3. Random scoring conditions in the setup, no luck element later on. 4. Strategic and tactical at the same time. 5. Gives a great feeling of fulfilment when you're creating your little empire. 6. An ideal amount of interaction for such a brainburner (you CAN screw other people, but there's no direct confrontation). And the mechanics are just lovely! Exchanging low level buildings with the high level ones means you really need to plan well and time the conversion, and the power mechanic introduces some interesting dillemas - you want to be very close to other players, but you still need space to expand.

Still, words can't convey the warm, pleasant feeling of your brain burning in every single turn of this wonderful affair. This is definitely my "what game would you take on a desert island" type of thing. Just can't get enough of it! Cons? It is a bit less exciting with 2p, but still great, and the theme is paper thin - but who would expect theme here anyway...

The strategy in this can be very allusive but the game is incredibly fun and deep. 
My only complaints are that the races are not balanced evenly and that the way turn order works is stupid like Agricola and not awesome like Caylus (both of those complaints will be addressed in the expansion).
~11/05/14 

The lack of balance in the faction is very frustrating. I realize that the base games faction balance is pretty good considering the number of factions but it is not as good as I would like. The game is already complicated enough to make it difficult to know why I am doing well or poorly. Having some factions be really good and some really poor is a major bummer. I had hoped that the expansion would improve this but it did not. It made it worse. Instead of adding some fun well balanced factions it provided factions that are at the top and the bottom of the charts. That is the worst kind of expansion. So frustrating. I really wouldn't mind if i didn't play this again. If they adjust the factions enough on Snellman to get them more balanced then my tune would likely change quite a bit.

RATING: 10
If your group craves both complexity and quick turns, this is your game.  I've played this game at least 100+ times with different player counts, and almost everyone (of people who like the more complex games) is a big fan.  Once everyone gets a few plays in, it's also pretty good with a few drinks (unless you're super competitive and want to win).

I have to give this game a perfect 10, something I very rarely do.  I really have a hard time finding anything wrong with this game.
Pros - 
Player conflict is not direct, so no one has a very competitive rivalry to make them angry.
Downtime with experienced players is minimal because turns are very short.
You can easily plan actions on other players turns because their actions most of the time do not have much affect on you (but when they do, it can really hurt or help)
Almost no luck at all involved in the game, which means people can't get screwed over by dice.
Component quality is amazing, this game weighs like 5 pounds
Rules seem complicated, but after 1 play you realize they are very straightforward and leave almost no need for any FAQ to address weird scenarios (like fantasy flight games :O)
Play time with experienced players is not incredibly long, but the game keeps you interested the whole time either way

Cons-
Direct Player interaction is very minimal in comparison to other games, but this doesn't hurt this game due to other factors
Too many options during your action, sometimes it's really hard to choose
Not investing in something early in the game can sometimes really hurt you for victory points.
Some races seem way better than others (this has been statistically proven, Faqirs are literally un-playable if you want to win)

Although I did list some cons, they don't really seem to hurt gameplay that much, and I realize that no one game can be perfect in every way.  It's just that this game is probably the closest to a perfect 10 I will ever see, which is why I give it a 10.

This is one if my favorite games to date. Having played it originally from a guy who gets games from Essen I fell in love with it. When it finally got released here in the states I was thrilled and lucky enough to get a copy. 

I play it whenever I can and recently was gifted the fire and ice expansion which adds more fun to an already popular game!

Best game for me so far.
The theme is a little dry, but i couldn't care less. My group loves it! We play sometimes 3 times in a row.
My wife doesn't enjoys it enough, because I always want to play it and she doesn't.
However she plays it sometimes e get into to it when she does.
The game length is good, but sometimes you wish that were more rounds into it. 
The replay-ability is very good given the fact that there are a lot of factions, even without the expansion, and the set up is always different. If you get used to the game you can prepare your actions in a way that you make the most of every round.
My group started with puerto rico, but when we got to TM we kind of never went back to puerto rico.

This is such a wonderful design! 
This game has so much depth, none other could compete with it in my opinion. Everything counts.
- The initial draft for races is a game in itself. You have to consider the available bonus tiles, the available scoring tiles and the order of them, your opponent's choices - just everything!
- then there is the order in which you take your actions. You have to think with your opponent's head, your have to predict, what she is going to do, and plan accordingly. 
- already at the very beginning it must be clear which are the hot spots on the map. 
- When you pass is also highly important. It defines turn order for next turn, so it is important to anticipate when your opponent pass. Sometimes it is better to forfeit an action or two just to be the start player next turn. 
- There are so much more: the scarcity of the recourses, the favor tiles, the different player powers add so much to the game.
- Player powers: it is boardgaming best puzzle to tinker with them, to try to find the best possible strategy with each of them.
I think this is a game with depth enough to warrant strategy guides in book format; you couldn't tell that about too many games. 
True, the art is more practical than beutyful, but who cares...
A modern classic!

My favorite aspect of Terra Mystica is just how many factions I can choose from. I like the idea of trying a different strategy every time I play. That being said, I don't love this game as much as my gaming group. The style of the board is reminiscent of my least favorite games- same old tired wooden bits connected across hexes, etc. 

In the end, I always enjoy playing Terra Mystica, but I can't ever see it being a favorite unless an expansion adds something more. The terraforming mechanic was a great start, but as it stands, it's a great game that needs to find more identity.

A game with lots of options and plenty to think about. Better with four players than with two, although more players can result in some downtime. The rules are kind of long, and not exactly streamlined: lots of little "special" rules to learn and remember. Once you've wrapped your head around the rules, it's an excellent game.

Good game.  Deep, but not overly complex.  The "right" course of action is fairly obvious and driven by the bonus tiles for that round.  But being as efficient as possible is not easy.

Need to balance town creation, maximizing bonus each round, building the 'right' buildings to maximize bonuses, manage the amount of resources spent on the cult tracks effectively, etc... etc....

Good, engaging Euro.  Recommended.

This game has a lot going for it, sadly balance is not one of those things.  It is very easy to lock someone down and create a 3 hour quagmire.  Been the giver and the receiver of such, and it doesn't make for pleasant or even competitive play.

RATING: 9.5
This game is awesome! It's all about managing your resources and making the best use of your race. Each game is different in the random power tiles, and the round tiles will always be different (and in a different order). There are many ways to victory, and utilizing each the best way is the only way to win. The game is just an absolute blast, with NO LUCK. It's all strategy. Yes, it can feel like multi-player solitaire, but it's the indirect interaction with players that makes this one shine. Plus, for a heavy game, it plays very quickly. 100 minutes is a very good estimate.

Can't understand the hype around this game... Takes way too long for what it is. The game feels mechanical and I don't see anything amazing in the action mechanism.

Description: Euro, engine building, resource management, area control, worker placement, action allowance, civilization building in a fantasy world.
Weight: Heavy (to medium)Euro game. 3 to 4 hours.
Number of players: 2 to 5, best with 4 and 5.

Impression: Game tuned to my taste. Perfect mechanics, perfect game length, perfect complexity, huge replay value. It's a great middle to heavy weight euro brain burner placed in fantasy setting where 14 (20 with expansion) different factions build their empires on different types of terrain through terraformation. Every player has his own type of terrain on which he can build and they are also competing for the favor of gods in 4 cults: Fire, Water, Earth and, who would know it, Air. It is fairly complex, but perfectly designed. The components are beautiful, artwork is quite appealing and most of the factions factions are so perfectly balanced with many paths to victory. Few factions are broken, however, but that is addressed by official rule changes and errata.
People mostly criticize the lack of player interaction. For me, there is pretty enough of it. Although there are no any direct conflicts, we were constantly competing to in a race for different objectives and goals. Also the mechanic where it is much cheaper to expand your city next to other players while it also gives them power points to use their magic is fantastic. The game is just awesome!

Likes: It has 14 conceptually different races (20 with expansion) and choosing your race is a game within game; variable player powers, 3-part variable setup making every game different, cool power point mechanic, 2 different maps, list goes on.

Dislikes: Learning curve is quite steep and not everybody will enjoy that. Some races are so broken they needed official errata and rework.

I've had to bump this up to a 10. I've played it regularly since I bought it, I always bring it with me when I go out to games clubs, and I still feel like I'm exploring how to ply.

I've played this game four times. It isn't as 'heavy' as some people suggest and I've seen first-time players win it. It just requires a lot of attention.

It is amusing how the game tries to tempt you (with immediate victory points etc) away from your smooth, sustainable economic pathway.

Player are often competing for tokens, areas etc. It may not provide a lot of 'direct' interaction (but see below), but it does provide a lot of enjoyable tension while you work hard to try to grab whatever you need before your opponents do ... and hope they haven't noticed what you desperately need.

It's one of those games where, afterwards, players burst into conversation about how they could have played more efficiently.

The game gives many players a huge buzz because of how competitive it becomes, especially in the final two turns. You very much feel you've earned your victory.

I like its focus on common recurring abilities/options rather than on things like flipping random tiles etc. It means you can plan ahead quite rigorously, although the 'human randomness' element can force re-planning.

The game provides additional nice opportunities for planning. For example, the first player to decide to end their actions each turn automatically becomes the first player to act in the next turn ... which is great because they know they'll get 'first dibs' at a particular one-use 'power action' etc (which all become available again at the start of each new turn).

It also has excellent iconography etc. It's exceptionally tidily designed.

My only concerns are:
1) No information is hidden in the game. This means that players can begin to play VERY slowly if they are desperate to calculate the best possible move. The speed of the game depends a lot on how competitive players are and how good they are at calculating efficiency with a lot of simply cube-counting etc.
2) Interaction between players is quite low. Having said that, it is a lot of fun when you DO find a good opportunity to mess with another player because it can really damage their chances. A lot of it depends on how much you can be bothered to stare at everyone else's piles of cubes, money, income, buildings etc and calculating their weaknesses and probable actions.
3) You do strategise, but mostly it's about mathematically making the most of your resources.
4) Starting positions/options are an important part of the game. So, if players are very robust throughout the game, the starting positions might largely determine who wins.
5) As others say, it's fairly abstract.

Absolutely wonderful game. Fixes problem of many area control games by giving 2 incentives to build next to each other (cheaper TPs & leach). It is enough for people to want to pile up, creating a dilemma between being close to each other vs having a lot of space to expand. I wouldn't play this with 2, since it breaks that. Probably will raise this to full 10 when I have time to play this more (I have played quite lot, but currently my 10 needs a LOT of playing - TS got there after 2000 plays ; Eclipse a lot less (about 100), but all FTF & some with up to 9 people).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very good modern Euro. High replayability due to the different races (most of them are well balanced). Nice art with excellent iconography. First step is to learn how to build a good economy/many buildings. Second step is to learn how to score points effectively. 

While the scoring at the end is quite thematic (you get points for the expansion of your race or much you praised a certain god, i.e. cults), pretty much all the other scoring is rather abstract and pasted on. This is even true for some race bonuses. So Terra Mystica seems to be a perfect mix of theme and fitting mechanics, but after a while you recognize that the focus is rather on the mechanics. Unfortunately, because of the all the different mechanics this game takes about 40 minutes to explain and usually overwhelms beginners.

While there is some interaction (race to certain spots on the maps, race on the cult tracks, limited mana bonus actions), the major part of the game is solving the puzzle how to accomplish what you want to do this turn. But there is enough interaction to not call TM a multiplayer solitaire game (but the 80% of the time it actually is). I really appreciate that when you look at the board at the game's end, you really think you have created a little kingdom (the typical Catan feeling).

Yet another baroque conversion machine. Like Hansa Teutonica and Luna, it's a smart, elaborate, abstract euro which offers all sorts of levers to pull. It all works, and the presentation is well thought out.

However, these games will never use a two step process when a three or four step process can be shoehorned into the design. And there's almost no interaction. I have very little desire to play these sorts of games anymore. Yes, euros are abstract. But they used to be elegant as well. The trend towards ever more convoluted VP puzzles leaves me cold. There's isn't any table-talk and joking in our normally garrulous group with Terra Mystica. That's not a good sign.

Another landmark in my growing disenchantment with modern euros and the BGG hype machine.

An interesting remark was made about the 'cult of the new' and how a particular game might only get one or two plays. It came in the context of this and Ora et Labora and it intrigued me because neither are light games. There is a lot to learn in this sort of game. First there are rules, then once you have mastered the rules (clearly a couple of games) there are all sorts of different game effects that need to be taken on board before you can really begin to think about tactical and strategic problems. It seems an odd situation that as popular games get deeper in terms of their complexity and learning curves most players seem to spend less time playing them.

I really don't know where to start describing my absolute favourite game - suffice to say that there are dozens of games I really like, and a handful that I love, but that this is head and shoulders above all others. It's hard to explain precisely why, but it is easy to list several of its great features. The no fewer than 14 different factions (or 20 if you have the expansion), all of which play completely differently from each other (and all of which, with perhaps 1 exception, have a chance of winning if the game conditions, randomly chosen when setting up but before players pick which faction to play, are moderately favourable to them). The many different ways the game can be set up (that is, the bonus tiles in play, and the order of scoring tiles) which mean that every game is different, even though the game itself has no hidden information once setup has been completed. The great tension arising throughout over so many things - players vying with each other for key hexes on the board, for the often crucial power actions, for the most advantageous favour tiles, and for the largest network and highest cult positions for endgame scoring. On top of this, there is further player interaction based on wanting to have neighbours (but hoping those neighbours don't steal key hexes from under you!), for cheaper upgrades and more power coming in - as well as the decisions regarding whether to pass early or late to try to get the bonus tile you need for next round. (Those who claim TM is multiplayer solitaire have either never played it or were asleep when they were playing.) The power system itself, which is simple enough but to my knowledge unique and means that spending too much too early might mean you lack the ability to spend lots later in the game. And the resource management headaches over all the resources in the game - while having your income each turn determined by what you have on the board is hardly a novel idea, in TM you really never have enough of every resource you might need, and are forced to plan things sometimes a full turn or more in advance. Until of course another player steps on that plan.

It all adds up to a game which I so far played over 200 times when including both "real life" and online games - I have not tired of it in over 3 years since I first played, and cannot see it ever happening. (And this would be true even without the expansion, although that adds an amazing amount to the game as well.)

I can't get enough of this game! There's a lot going on and all the game mechanics run tightly together. It's fairly daunting at first, but the game takes less time to set up than you would think (given all the pieces that come in the box), and the game is surprisingly easy to learn. All the different factions, scoring tiles, and bonus scrolls add a ton of replayability. It runs a little bit longer than most games my group likes to play, but I'm going to pushing hard for this one every game night for the foreseeable future!

Terra Mystica offers an experience that continually helps you to feel more intelligent than you actually are. It has a lot going on, but none of it is difficult to understand. 

A major part of its draw is both experiencing and mastering each faction or race. Many games grow stale in less plays than it takes to simply try each Terra Mystica faction once.

(+) Many different playing styles may lead to success

(+) I love the mechanism in which neighbours are not only competing for land, but are also aiding each other. It makes this game truly shine. Sometimes you will hate your neighbours, but really, you can't live without them!
(+) A different setup and chosing a different faction ensures a different gaming experience every time


(-) In a certain way the factions limit your way of playing the game: each faction has a playing style and in most cases it forces you to play that way, which decreases the level of creative thinking and strategic plan-development
(-) Some setups may favour certain factions which might make the game a bit unbalanced

This is a fascinating game of resource management coupled with a tight timing element. In this respect it reminds me of Tzollk'in despite providing a fairly different experience.

I played this with the full 5 players, and it still felt like player interaction was minimal.  There was a degree of satisfaction in expanding your buildings and terraforming, but the whole affair felt terribly self-involved. I'd be willing to give this another try with a different combination of races, but I didn't feel particularly invested in what I was doing.  I think this would have been better off with a sci-fi terraforming theme - I just don't get the link with fantasy.

Good 'ol Eurogame fun-ness. I can see the game becoming a group favorite. Streamlined very nicely so that every thing makes sense except the cult track. It doesn't gel with me having the cult track give out victory points, but I like that it helps with the power structure. I think knowing when to lose some power tokens to gain quick useful power is key to getting the power-structure in place to help you each turn. Building by others helps, but only if they decide to build and help you out too. 

I liked parts of their other games, but this one is fun during the entire game. Great job bringing this one to light. The world is a better place because this game was designed and brought to market. :P

The power cube actions are a great way to add some options to pull off moves to help with your strategy.  A great gamers' game with rules that are pretty easy to get the hang of.  Replayability has to be through the roof on this due to the many factions, bonus powers, random scoring tiles, and random favors.

"Not so good - but could play again." said the 4 stars.
I would say: it has good mechanics and is well structured but I played it once and i'm not in hurry to play it again. Too abstract. it's "cold" ....if someone would tell me "you won't be able to play it again", i wouldn't miss it. Personal tastes obviously.

There's something very satisfying about building your empire in Terra Mystica.  Everything in the game feels pretty abstracted, and it doesn't feel as if there is an incredible amount of theme, but the different races in the game are what provide Terra Mystica with its incredible flavor.  Finding ways to exhaust your race-specific powers to eke out those extra points that your opponents might not be privy to is very exciting.  The symbiotic mechanisms that encourage players to build their towns next to each other is also an interesting implementation.  This game works well an any player count, in my experience.

This is a case of flavor of the week not meeting expectations for me. When it first came out, this game was always on the table, and I heard so much hype about this game that I was extremely excited to play it. Then I played it and it was just... OK. Not bad, but not the greatest thing in the world as it was hyped up to be. I've played it four times as of writing this, and while I can see it is a good game- it's not a great game and not one that I even feel the need to own. I probably wouldn't turn down a game of it, but also probably wouldn't suggest it.

Game is not that complicated at all.  The actions are all very straightforward and the iconography easily explained and understood.  While there will be some thinking how to manage one's turn, it should be a fairly quick game.  My current quibble is that it isn't really.  Our first play was done at a leisurely pace and still clocked in at nearly 3 hours.  And frankly that is too long for this game of only 6 turns.  I am hoping that familiarity with the game will speed it up greatly.  If this could be done in the listed 90-120 minutes, the rating would go up.  But if gameplay is pushing 180 minutes or more, the rating will go down.  We played with 4 players, so I am currently dreading any play with 5 due to the length (and downtime).

a solid euro.  Not yet sure how well balanced the factions are.

I felt that the core game was good, but the individual faction powers may actually undermine it.  E.g. they kind of force your strategy and narrow your strategic options.

Each time I've played, I've loved the game at first, but been tired of it by the end.  It very slightly overstays its welcome and is a bit too repetitive, but it's still a very solid game.

i'm not entirely sure why this is sooo popular. it's a euro game that does it's job of converting things, network building, converting other things, area control, and upgrading. that it does this with so much asymmetrical struggle and without action points (!!) is certainly to it's credit. but, there's just a heap of complication going on. it's difficult for me to hold a strategy in my head when someone drives a spike into an unanticipated cleft. but, should everything be anticipatable? i suppose it would be only somewhat of a race with much more getting in each other's way if you could otherwise plan out yours and your opponent's moves at the same time. okay, fine fine. but, still, there's so much fiddle! fiddly in the sense of moving a few small wooden pieces each turn and so much going on that seems to be so minor. it's like hunting rabbits: mild petting zoo rabbits, but you're armed only with paper cuts. maybe that's not fair. okay, definitely not fair. but, i guess i'm saying i never really ever feel all that ahead or like i've done something worthwhile in the game. there's room to be clever, but every advance comes with a setback that just keeps it from feeling like an engine builder to me. it's rare to feel like i outsmarted anyone, rather that i managed to make something more expensive. if that's all i wanted, i think i'd rather play Concordia. at least it doesn't have those damn bowls.

21-09-2015. Surprising for me, I really liked this euro. I am not yet sure why.

In TM you are building towns, upgrading them to other buildings. You get more income the more stuff you have on the board. Each time you place something, you unlock more income. The twist here is that 'your' race of people you're playing, can only live in one type of environment. If you build in a different environment, you have to pay 'shovels' to modulate the area to your favorite environment.

You try to optimize your actions to build correct stuff quickly. If you build certain things, you can get power back. Power is a resource that comes in three levels. If you have lvl 3 power, you can spend it for resources, but it then reverts to leve 1. From there, you can upgrade it back to level 2, and to level 3, but you're only allowed to increase to level 3 until you don't have level 2 stuff.

You score by getting cities, racial abilities, having most points in the 'temple' tracks.

I surprisingly, really, really, really enjoyed this game. There are MANY things to monitor, but the scoring is relatively straight forward. That said, there are ways to compete for scoring. Yes, it's not direct conflict.. and the game came from a slow start but I really enjoyed it.. and I find myself wondering why.

RATING: 6
Interesting, puzzley eurogame where you are basically trying to figure out the best way to get your resource engine going with your particular race.  As it's one of the those games where a wrong move early on can cripple you and you learn how you could have avoided your mistakes as the  game progresses, new players often want to play it again to try to get the resource engine right, but I can see it losing its replayability after that relatively quickly. Completely absent of theme (ok, some of the races' abilities are slightly thematic, but many other aspects like priests allowing you to upgrade ships or terraforming are anti-thematic) and relatively little player interaction (there's some competition for which spaces to build), so steer clear if that's what you're looking for.

--Nov2012-- After a couple plays (in neither of which I played very well) I'm completely hooked.  This is a very cool engaging design, with a whole mess of subtle tradeoffs to make.

If it happens, I'll believe I've got my money's worth.)

Optimization and logistics study with fairly interesting theme. A mash-up of known mechanics and different races works quite well. Especially nice that almost all rules can be found in the iconography and images on the game board and tiles.

Boggling resource management and cerebral strategy isn't really my bag, but Terra Mystica is just good enough to overcome my own biases.

In some mechanisms it's related to "Eclipse" ... and this should be regarded as a compliment. Maybe it also followed "Trajan"'s example with the lighter version of these bowls. All in all a fantastic mixture of the best game mechanisms and a portion of designer's finesse.
I can see a high replayability factor.

It's okay, but it feels like it just has too many mechanical systems all spinning in their own direction.  I feel like I would rather have played two 90-minute games each with half the mechanics, as opposed to the three-and-a-half-hour marathon that was Terra Mystica.  (I'm told that it "only" takes 2.5-3 hours when the players are experienced, which is still more than I want to spend on this type of game.)

This is such a perfect strategy game because there is never any right answer. Every advance you make is causing you to give something up, and every decision has several valid choices.
Do I build a Stronghold this turn, or Wait until I'll get bonus points for building it? Should My Preist go onto the Cult Track so I can dominate there, or Am I better off dropping the cost of my shovels? Do I keep expanding with settlements and so I have lots of workers, or do I lose some settlements so I can build Temples/Trading posts and get Priests or money? 
You also feel like the other players matter. Even in a 2 player game you wont want to build far away from the other player, because that costs more gold. So you are always on top of each-other, blocking each-others plans with your own teraforming actions. 

This is my Favorite BG right now. Even though I lose most games, I always enjoy the experience of playing. In some ways I'm just trying to build a more perfect world each time I play, It's literally impossible to have a 'perfect' game - but it's great to see how close you can get anyway.

Good medium-heavy optimization game with some original ideas and no randomness except for the setup. Not my type though: not thematic enough, some mechanics have no connection with theme, and points are awarded for practically everything, requiring constant careful calculation. Quite penalizing: if you don't think your actions through carefully, you can easily find yourself with no money/workers/power and it's VERY difficult to remedy that. If you like having many options you can't possibly pursue in one game, it might be up your alley.

I probably haven't played this enough for a final verdict. It did seem just a little too dry long: as a beginner it's hard to do anything, so there's a feel of plodding along, that may or may not vanish with repeat plays. I would suggest Hansa Teutonica or Trajan instead.

There is however, no luck involved at all in this game, and that may put some people off, however, trying this game to at least appreciate the design is well worth the time.

I don't remember playing a game for the first time and liking it this much. This is a heavy Euro of building a machine of resources and points, with a high dose of area control. The different races can only build in a certain sort of terrain, where no one else can. So players have to terraform in order to construct, and keep and eye in their rivals in the fight for the best spots and the different ways of scoring points.

RATING: 8
On the heavy-ish side of euros, with lots of layers of rules, but somehow it all blends together quite nicely.

The fact that there are so many different player abilities (often very original) is very good for replayability, as often players want to try different ones (I can't really pronounce on balance, though).

Really enjoyed my first few plays of this, but around play 5 felt the game was formulaic. Not "solvable" but that the strategies of the individual races and the order of the bonus tiles chained you to a strategy. I also don't think the races are terribly well balanced and the game doesn't offer much in the way of allowing the players to level them. I still enjoy it, but it's lost it's shine.

RATING: 8
I have very conflicted feelings on this game. As of today, my single playthrough went horribly, it was way too heavy a game for me and I couldn't see ever wanting to play it again. But much like my experience with Panamax, I've had a couple of days to stew on it, reflect on what the mechanics are, think about what I could have and should have done, and am now anxious to try it again to see how I would do after grokking the rules. 

Make no mistake: this is a heavy, HEAVY beast of a game. I can see this being a lifestyle game for some people, with the amount of strategic and tactical depth and crazy replay ability. Is it for me? Not really sure. Were I to buy this, it would probably occupy a space in my collection next to Agricola and Panamax as games that I love but no one will play with me. 

So my current ranking is more of a sign of respect and curiosity to revisit. Will hopefully solidify my feelings soon. Maybe not until after my new-dad brain fog has passed, though. 

Update 2017-01-20: After my second game in which I scored even less points than I did on my first, I realize more of the tactical/strategic errors I made and how I could improve my play. And yet, I think I can accept that this game might not be for me. I have the utmost respect for it mechanically, and I'll be happy to play it any time I'm asked, but I think it's just too heavy for me. But my feelings may change once the app comes out and I can get a few more games under my belt.

Update 2017-06-15: I've now played the app several times and played another game on the table, and I'm bumping my rating from a 7 to an 8. Yes, it's heavy. Yes, there are so many possibilities of what to do on a turn that it's completely overwhelming on the first several plays. But I've now come to respect this as a classic of the Euro genre. The amount of replayability is staggering; every faction plays differently and requires a completely different strategy. The balance of tactical moves and overall strategy is pretty difficult to get on top of... I can't say I'm good at it, but I'm better than I was.

My favorite Euro game.  Love the mechanisms and variety in powers.  This is not something for casual gamers and is very rules heavy but as with all good games, it is in a way that disappears after a game or two and leaves you weighing strategic decisions each and every turn you take.  The number of different races and how unique they each play is to be applauded.

A lot of mechanics that work very intuitive and simple. 

This is a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, trying to figure out whether it's better to build a trade post now, or wait for the next round. It's a constant attempt to optimise your path of action. At the same time, the other players do the same. Beware, though. It won't be long before you're in each others way.

For the big rule book and lots of pieces, the gameplay itself works rather quick. With 4 people, the game took about 4 hours (including reading the manual from cover to cover).

Picked up like new from gamer on BGG in the local area.  Played for first time at CotN.  This game is heavy but I love the challenge of learning all the ways you can try to score points.  So many races to learn and all different special abilities.  Definitely worth investing time in and I hope to play this a lot in he coming months.

While the game is good with 3, it shines with 5.  A game of very tight resources - and with a full slate, space as well - that keeps you planning and adjusting as you choose which action to take each turn.  

The variable powers of each race and the changes to the rewards available each round help to ensure a differing game each time.

Although there seems to be a lot going on, even for new players it only takes a turn or two to get into the swing of things.

What else needs to be said?  This is a really smart combination of known mechanisms (plus the nifty "terraforming" thing) and although the explanation phase is longer than average, owing to lots of variation, it is that variation which makes the game.
The strategic routes may be a little constrained, but there's lots to explore here.

edit: down a point due to several unenjoyable games in a row - I suspect as a result of unfortunate combinations rather than anything else.

Terra Mystica is a fantastic euro game with many layers of competition. It took me several plays to get into the game, and it's not at it's best with 2 players. It requires a little more planning from the beginning of the game than I find ideal, but it is a rock solid euro with asymmetric player powers.

One of the hardest games I have to explain to new players, with so many different rules and mechanics and scorings. However, when it is played, it is really simple to understand what you need to do to win, and it is really fun to play. The number of different races is great, and they mostly play differently.

Brilliant game. After 2 plays I'm thirsting for more and wanting to try out all the different factions and so on. For such a deep strategy game the rules are surprisingly easy to teach, but of course mastery will be much more difficult to attain - which is as it should be for a great strategy game. This one is bound for the top 5 in the BGG rankings I believe, and I'm happy to help it on it's way.

RATING: 5
A 3X game that removes eXterminate and clunks up the eXplore and eXploit. I love what they did with eXplore, not so much with eXploit.

I've been waiting for a game that does spatial play like that in Settlers of Catan, and Terra Mystica comes very close, with early settlement expansion and a key 'Longest Road' bonus. Towns (clusters of your stuff) remind me of Taluva, another paragon of cool spatial play. But the coolest thing, and unique to this game, is Terraforming. Get digging in that space into your favorite color before you're allowed to settle there, and heck, go dig holes around your opponent's area and not settle yet if you can't afford it yet. It is visually arresting to remake the world in the world-view of your species, as attempted in Dominant Species (but the visual wasn't strong enough there), and it's awesome to shit on your neighbors' garden.

Unfortunately, the economy and player boards are too overwrought for their own good, and it remains to be seen if I can grow to tolerate them. The 'peel off and see which resources you gain now' Euro flavor du jour is totally unnecessary.

What I hate most about this (and lots of Euros) is that you get VPs for everything, including scratching your ass. Heck, this one further devalues the meaning of VPs by letting you lose it to gain magic.

Ah, magic is cool. I like the idea of it in Magestorm, but it got buried there, and it's good for it to gain a wider audience here.

Variable player powers are nice, Dominant Species / Eclipse style (small but significant gameplay-wise).

This game feels like Catan, Taluva and Dominant Species had a threesome (and Hansa Teutonica / Eclipse are uninvited voyeurs with their peel-off player boards).

[hr]

After 5 plays (2 were online), I find the stilted player interaction extremely disappointing. Caring about the others is limited to competing on cult tracks and longest network (puzzle interaction), some timing with drafting bonus tiles (hard to manipulate, more just a bonus if it synergizes), leeching (which is just build-where-opponents-are, that's it), trivial blocking, and drafting power actions. Only the latter is of any value, and even that is just raise your head and trivially check who wants what (you have no coins and you have 4 power in reserve, I see...) or just grab the popular ones that always disappear with the first action each round. This really is an overly strategic game where you spend a ton of time at the start shaping it (including which faction to choose, which is not offered by a lot of other games simply because it's too strategic), then implement it, with your only obstacles being poor math-ing and getting locked out of a power action because you passed too late the previous round. It's not surprising that people brag about their highest scores with each faction, not their win rate, because this is a masturbatory game. I do find the interlocking slightly interesting and will hence tolerate this, albeit purely to show off, not for meaningful enjoyment.

This game could have been so much more, but as it is, Eclipse and Hansa Teutonica are far more fledged-out designs with respect to player interaction and actually being a game, not a puzzle. Lowered design from 4 to 3.

3+2

Oh dear, where do I start?  First off, it's ugly.  The races are nicely rendered, but aside from that, the buildings are plain and the map is blech.  Secondly, there are lots of mechanics that don't seem to go well together.  There was potential right from the get-go for me to have crippled one of my opponents, but I couldn't do that to them as no one wants to spend a three hour game without being able to do anything.  That's a problem.  Also, the races are not well-balanced.  When you get repeatedly told that this race is too good and that one is lousy, that's a big warning sign - asymmetric starts need to be well-done and handled properly and they aren't in TM.

It wasn't that I didn't understand what was going on, it was that I didn't really enjoy what was going on.  I find it very hard to believe that this is the 6th best game on BGG at the time of this writing.  Wow.  It totally devalues the rating system for me.  I think my opinion of this game was higher before I played it.  After playing it, I can certainly think of countless other three-hour games that I'd rather play.  It's just another case of a 5p game that I really didn't like.

If you like fun games, then this is definitely one to avoid, because it certainly wasn't that for me.

very high quality components.  The game itself is well done but after several plays the races don't feel like they play much differently to me.  I wish there was a way to add more different technologies or magic or whatever to the game so that I could try different strategies, but in general the game forces you to try to maximize the points you get from the round tiles each round and the bonus tiles.  I do really like the game but the 14 different races don't add as much replay value as I had hoped they would.

[i]And you may find yourself living inside a spread sheet
And you may find yourself behind a panel with many levers
And you may find yourself in the cogs of a large resource engine
And you may find yourself with beautiful plans making beautiful points.
And you may ask yourself
Well...How did I get here?[/i]

It's amazing in how smoothly everything works and avoids the usual euro clunkiness. Very good at what it does. What it does however is being a humongous resource engine. Period. So you're living inside this huge machine, catering to its demands and needs. Interaction, while there is some, isn't as tight as you always have plans B, C, D when plan A fails. While the game ticks many boxes kinda along the way (a little theme, little blocking, little leeching, little narrative) it's just you and the spread sheet machine. And you have to keep it running.

Other first impressions: races felt pretty samey, even if they probably play differently, I found art to be a bit dreadful, the building aspect is neat, but not where the gameplay is (huh?).

[i]There's too many cubes
Too many meeples
Making too many options
And not much talk to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion.[/i]

After a few days I've finally came to a conclusion: it's the new breed of perfect euro clockwork machines that all purr and hum happily and give a crap about players. The trick these games pull is throwing sand in player's eyes with so much complexity, giving you so much stuff to do, handle, explore that it totally overwhelms a player and give them an impression there's a lot of going on, when it's mostly just racing your own engine (or rather the engine races you, yay). If you check the game's forums you'll also notice the crazy level of optimisation execution this game brings out of people. Sigh. When did our hobby become playing optimisation puzzles? When did somewhat enjoyable become good enough? It works. So what?. As always: the system works because you work.

Played twice. A very ambitious and heavy Euro which offers 14 different races for players to choose and play to their strengths. I actually like that idea, as it gives a lot of room for players to explore the variety of strategies in the game.

What rubs me the wrong way is that there are one too many bonuses and distractions that demand the players' attentions. There's a wide range of bonuses for achieving cities, there are end-round and end-game bonuses and temple tracks as well. At some point I feel that the game is overstuffed.

[1 play] Overwhelming experience learning this game, and perhaps it would have been better if my brain was fresh instead of later in the day. So my rating could improve if I can play this again soon enough to benefit. This game is definitely on the upper end of my tolerance for hyper-complicated mechanisms. The iconography is helpful after awhile, but a hinderance at first.

I need to try again before I can fairly evaluate this game.

This game is off the charts good! I don't often feel up to playing a two-hour game, but if I do, I wanna play Terra Mystica! This game takes some mechanics from other games and works them into a masterpiece. The many available factions all feel unique in the way they work. There is hardly any luck to this game- just pure strategic goodness. The replayability is tremendous. I adore the power mechanic- gaining power when others build around you and various ways in which you can use it to gain advantages. I wish I played this game even more. It's so dang good!

This game has grown from an 8 to a 9 to a 10 for me.  I have not mastered a single race and even if all the races are not equally balanced I find this game scratches a certain intellectual part of my brain many games don't reach.  Plus the fact it plays with four in 2 hours or less makes it a great game.  Reaches all the places games like Dominant Species and Eclipse hit without the time commitment.  It has the added advantage/disadvantage of no direct conflict but you can still disrupt your neighbours through taking the right spot on the board the correct priest space on the cult board or the favour they wanted or the starting benefit.  A wonderful game everyone should play 3 times before rating.

Terra Mystica accomplishes something I am always impressed by in a euro - meaty gameplay in a short time package. The game itself is fascinating in that whilst the turn by turn objectives which reward building certain structures or taking certain actions lay out a 'map' players can follow, its often not in your best interests to do so. The game is deep, tense and greatly enjoyable - I'll have my eye on all future games by the designers.

This game is still played a *lot*.

It is really strategic, full of interesting choices. When I first opened the box, I got scared looking at the number of components thinking that it might be too complex or fiddly, but its not like that at all. It takes a little while to learn, but its quite straightforward once you understand the rules. If you like deep strategic games, then this is a must have.

* Highly strategic, very little luck
* Essentially a resource management game. Very innovative way of putting buildings on the board gives you resources for the next round. And upgrading puts the old building back on the board. So upgrading opens up one resource, but it block another one. Your brain will be occupied just thinking about the way resources interlock
* Cycling of power is very nice. Power gives you a bonus now, but it will be a while before you get it back into bowl 3
* Tons of variety. Each faction plays differently, and there are 20 factions (with Fire & Ice expansion)
* Different board setup means the game is subtly different each time you play, even with the same faction
* Fantastic components

- This game is a boring and solvable mathematical puzzle with often massive downtime between turns.
- The theme in this game is basically non-existing.
- The gameplay mechanics are an incoherent mess, I have no sense of achievement while playing.
- Multiplayer solitaire: there is no interaction in this game, everyone plays for themselves, solving their boring puzzle.
- Terra Mystica is a prime example of a "victory point salad": most of the scoring mechanisms (e.g. cult tracks) are tacked on.
- No luck factor: As this game is solvable from the beginning, it is nearly impossible to recover from errors made.
- The different playable factions are [url=http://terra.snellman.net/stats/]imbalanced[/url]. Since there is no luck in this game, this really is a problem.
- This is a horrible 2-player game because of the static map, which is equal for all player counts.

This is one of the driest and most boring Eurogames I have ever played. I would rather do someone's tax declaration than play this ever again. I simply cannot understand the hype about it and I hope that the high ratings won't encourage game designers to come up with similar junk.

This is really becoming a favorite of mine.  Now played games at all player counts and the game really seems to shine at 4 and 5, 3 a bit behind.  Probably would choose something else at 2, but mainly cause I have a lot of games that play great at 2.

Really want to keep playing and working on improving and playing different races and figuring out when is good to play what race.  This seems like a hit with friends too so I see lots of plays coming.  Decent amount of interaction in the way of competition for spaces, power actions, bonus tiles etc which make for some interesting decisions and planning.

Really hard to resist playing this a lot online like I have been doing with TTA, but I don't want to get to far ahead of friends/wife in learning curve like I did with TTA.  Luckily this one is much easier to get to the table than TTA.

Initial impressions from 2015-05-19
I would say about half of the factions are exposed to limited favorable conditions in regards to bonus tiles/round scoring bonuses. However, where it gets interesting is that the variability of this game greatly compensates for it. For the other half of factions, many approaches, possibilities and strategies appear to be possible. This is going to be exciting.

Update on 2016-02-06
After around 85 games total (currently at 60 finished games on terra.snellman.net with a rating of 1233), this is still my #1 and favorite board game. A big part of the game takes places in the choice of factions and in the placement of the initial dwellings at the very beginning of the game. Biggest lesson to date is the choice of your faction clearly must be made considering the following factors:
1- Other picked factions before AND after you
2- Round scoring tiles
3- Available bonus tiles. Extra emphasis on this one with the first round bonus tile that could be available for your opening.
Many strategies are available for each factions, even more than I thought, depending on the round scoring. Some factions are easier to learn and play with than others, but I would say that every faciton has a chance to win if the round scoring fits with their overall strategy.

Update on 2017/06/14
After now what amounts to 160 completed games on terra.snellman.net and 200+ plays total I still feel like I could learn greatly with about half of the factions and explore/develop/optimize new strategies. I am also still discovering openings which is the most crucial part of this game in my opinion. Combinations of the following elements: 1) Faction pick, 2) 1st round bonus tile, and 3) potentially available 1st round power actions lead to more and more interesting starts with some factions that would otherwise have poor opportunity to score well. In my case the most recent example and biggest learning curve would be Alchemists.

Toujours de loin mon jeu préféré, même après 2 ans depuis ma redécouverte des jeux de société et le début de ma collection. J'ai extrêmement hâte de jouer à Gaia Project mais je ne crois pas que mon intérêt pour Terra Mystica soit diminué dans un avenir rapproché.

Az első 2012-es esseni játék, ami kezem közé került. Nos úgy tűnik egyre jobban a másolásé lesz a főszerep, mert nehéz újat kitalálni. A Terra Mystica egy nagyon erős koppintása a Hansa Teutonicának. Megpróbáltak egy témát kreálni, amiben különböző fajok érvényesülését kell minél jobban menedzselnünk. Területek formálunk át és épületeket építünk, amivel felszabadulnak különböző erőforrásaink. Érdekességet a rengeteg faj és különböző képességeik jelentik. Az ilyen hátulütője mindig, hogy nehéz kiegyenlíteni a különböző képességeket, elsőre úgy tűnik itt sem sikerült. Bőven van erősebb és gyengébb faj a játékban, ami a különböző köri bónuszok miatt mindig változó mennyire jó vagy éppen rossz, de így nehéz egymáshoz mérni a játékokat és teljesítményeket. Mivel a HT-nél hosszabb így még azt sem lehet mondani rá, hogy könnyed, sőt kicsit talán gondolkodósabb is, bár az egyes fajok előnyeinek minél jobban való kihasználása könnyen vezet a követendő játék felé. Egyáltalán nem rossz játék a Terra Mystica, a Hansa T-t kedvelőknek biztos kellemes időtöltés lesz, akinek pedig a nagy előd nem ismerős biztos még kellemesebb élményben lesz része a játék során.

Pont két éve játszottam vele, így örültem, hogy előkerült. Azóta top3-as játék lett, sőt volt top2 is kis ideig. Ha nem is jó ennyire, de már én is jobbnak látom. Tényleg játszható minden faj, csak van amelyikhez több tudás szükségeltetik. Jó játék a Terra Mystica. Hibája talán az AP veszély, öten eléggé elhúzódhat. Emelek egyet a ponton.
7->8

[2015-02-14]
További játékok után egyre jobban érzem a játék nagyszerűségét. Lehet, hogy a fajok nem teljesen kiegyensúlyozottak, de több játékos esetén van olyan kis szerencse benne, ami ezt kompenzálhatja. Minden faj megismeréséhez minimum 3 játék szükséges szerintem, illetve teljesen más egy adott faj kétszemélyes és ötszemélyes játékban. Emiatt óriási az újrajátszhatóság.
A játék egyedüli hibája tényleg csak az AP veszélye.

[u]2013 Impression[/u]: Pure sophistication. Enough depth to keep me exploring for years.

[hr]
[u]2015 Update[/u]: This one has, sadly, fallen from grace. Used to be one of my few 10's, but now downgraded.

For a long time, I had ignored complaints about faction balance. The long development process (started in the late nineties!) and rigorous playtesting made me believe that the final product is fairly well balanced, and any remaining discrepancies are inconsequential. People just hadn't explored the depths enough - the big swings in faction statistics at Snellman's site reinforced this belief.

Upon the release of the expansion with the "fixed" board, the truth dawned upon me, and my misconceptions shattered. Fourteen factions with wildly differing abilities are just too many to balance. And now they have chosen to make the situation worse by adding yet more factions?!

Anyway, it's still a sophisticated game, and I should still enjoy it, right? Unfortunately, no. What I enjoy most about strategy games is pushing myself to get better. I have no desire to struggle against a system where the deck may be stacked against me (or my opponent) from the very start.

Once the game falls out of favour, smaller gripes get amplified. What's the deal with the ridiculous theme anyway? Engineers versus fakirs... really?!

Heavy euro with some sort of simulation value (more than can be said for most games in the genre) and soft fantasy undertones, set in a really mystical land where money is the most degraded (least convertible) of all resources. Will appeal to the optimising power gamer that enjoys parallel playing more than direct interaction. After a very suspicious approach, turns out it appeals to me too, rather surprisingly! I do have a certain desire to play more and try out strategies with the different races.

I like a game that is low luck, but has a lot of depth.  Terra Mystica definately qualifies.  It also has a lot of variety with the setup and includes 14 different factions for the players to choose from, which should guarantee a lot of replayability.  I do think an expansion would round things out a little more.  I can see how an alternate map layout would be very nice to have.

RATING: 10
Probably the most well made game i've played. It seems to be very nicely balanced between the races (though i've only played twice so far), and the map is well spaced out with the various terrain types. The components are solid, and easily replaced if misplaced and the game came with it's own zip-bags for storage of components.

I had a great time playing this, and look forward to more sessions with it.

Very cool abstract, with deluxe super powers.  It is like a cracked out Kingdom Builder.  Lots of fun objectives and ways to manipulate your growth.  I like the incorporation of the Hansa Teutonica/Eclipse tracking, where your abilities become revealed as you build.  

This is a game that absolutely rewards players knowing the comparative strengths of their character powers.  It would help first time players to know what the standard would be for a character sheet with no powers at all.  Who knows if these are remotely balanced...

My only big issue with the game is the tremendous potential for downtime.  If players are courteous and know what they are doing this should only last an hour an a half to two hours.  I was stuck in a nightmare game of this where after three and 1/2 hours I was ready for the game to be over.  There is little that you can do when it isn't your turn, so some minor assessment after each player's turn is about all the engagement that is required, but those with AP may have a difficult time of it, and kill all the joy of the participants.

RATING: 6
I recognize that this is a good/very good game. There is a lot that I like about it. 

One of my main gripes in this game, and the reason I don't love it, is the cult track. It feels like a distraction from what I find interesting about the game (namely, developing the board). Advancing on the tracks is really boring to me.

I feel similarly about Airlines Europe/ Union Pacific. There are interesting things you can be doing on the board, or you can get caught up in the boring race to have the most AE/UP cards. 

In the three aforementioned games, it just feels like there is a pressure cooker of interesting activity that someone keeps releasing the valve on. In many cases you can't ignore these boring races or you will lose out on crucial VPs.

I don't care about moving my meeple up the track, just let me build the board! I understand there is a crucial timing to when and how to move up the tracks to create synergies, I just can't get excited about it.

My gaming group has two of the most AP-prone people I've ever met. One is quietly AP as he sits there and analyzes every possible outcome, where the other is always saying 'if I do this, then I can do that, but he might attack there, so maybe I won't....'

I can think of at least a dozen possible choices on each turn, if you include the 8 actions listed on the reference card plus the 6(?) power conversions and the special actions you can have after building your upgraded buildings. As a result, a 4 player game lasted almost 3 hours, which is, quite frankly, way too long for a medium-heavy and somewhat mechanical euro. Now that I've played it once I'd probably try it again, but not with this group.

I missed a few key rules that cost me some points at the end, which I find irritating in games like this. So, not bad, but not one I'm going to rush out and buy or suggest we play, either.

Won this from the Play and Win at Geekway 2013, and its a fantastic game. You can tell a lot about how great a game is when you love it even when you come in last by a large margin (I did). A bit on the lengthy side, especially with new people, but it helps considerably if someone who has already played is there to explain it. Otherwise, good luck with that rulebook! I sure do wish I could play this more, its great.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game centered around variable player powers. There are 14 races to play, and each race must be played to make the most of their strenghts and weaknesses, making this a very srategic game. This is probably the most fun part of the game, figuring out how each race plays out and interacts with others.
This is a game that rewards planning almost the entirety of the game in advance. Player interaction is completely indirect. The full game highlights this as races will be drafted according the starting set-up. As such, the game is quite AP-prone.
Nevertheless, togethe with Tzolk'in, this is the Essen game of 2012!

Played as the Nomads, Chaos Magicians, Witches and Alchemists.

RATING: 9.5
Lots going on in this one. I think that the addition of power and how you get it from your nearby enemies really adds something special to this. Rating is certainly tentative, and hope to get in more plays to solidify the rating.

UPDATE: Truly an awesome game with great area control, plus just some intriguing mechanics, like how the power points are managed, both in moving then around and the pieces close to you.

RATING: 4
Fantastic strategy game that isn't too difficult to learn, filled with variable player powers, alternate paths to victory, different scoring tiles, etc. A huge amount of variation and replayability packed into this game.  The type of game that takes many, many plays to master.  It is for sure unbalanced, but a skilled player will win over an unskilled one.

EDIT: I'm rethinking that last comment as I learn more about the game... A more skilled player will win over an less skilled one MOST of the time. :-/

EDIT: The more I play the less I like this game.  There is not enough player interaction for the length of the game.  It is more of a race vs a battle.  And, I have been a part of too many games that were doomed before the first move based on map placement.

Terra Mystica is a million and one design ideas grafted onto a long resource management euro. That's not normally my thing, yet I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. For what it is, it's very good, a culmination of several older games--and, in many cases, lesser ones--taking the best ideas from sources as disparate as Settlers of Catan, Small World, and Through the Ages. I could identify others, I'm sure. It's a fusion of much of what's come before, most of which I'd probably pass on. But the result is impressively intuitive given the complexity, and surprisingly satisfying too.

Having said that, because there isn't much meaningful manipulation of other players' incentives, I suspect that repeat play would reveal less interaction and more optimization. One experienced player suggested that it's a game you can study by yourself at home if you want to do well, and I can see why. The barrier to victory is the complexity, not the other players. That's a lot less interesting to me.

It was not surprising how awesome this was to play. My first game was as the Alchemists, and I used the special money-to-VPs power to end up third in a five-player game.

There is a ton of interaction in this game. My biggest mistake was setting up too far away from the other players. This reduced my opportunities to leech power from their expansion.

Pros: Very tight mechanics. At first I was weary of the power and cult system. They initially seem distant from area control mechanics. I was surprised to find that the terraforming and cult mechanics work well together, with the power system integrating these two main mechanics. Although difficult to teach, the mechanics are refined and easily understood after one playthrough. Be weary of teaching this game to newer gamers.

Cons: Sometimes it feels as if the race you choose and the round bonuses force you down a certain path. However the round robin style action sequence circumvents this problems. Other players can indirectly screw up your plays through their choices of power along with their placement on the main and cult board.

Update. After playing several more times (mostly at the Snellman site), it is clear that the most important part of the game is the beginning where you look at the sequence and composition of round tiles!, the selection of bonus tiles in the game, your position in turn order, and the races others have already chosen; then you pick your race. The rest of the game is largely execution. Certainly, there are key decisions throughout as you react to what others are doing. But I think the key choice is that initial decision. That's not generally my kind of game. It's still good, but I'm not sure it will keep my interest. At least not enough to work at getting my own copy -- PBW may be more than enough for me. 

Rating 8 -> 7

Wow, what a cool game! The rules take quite a while to get through, but game play is actually pretty smooth. I like how the leaching-from-neighbors works, so that you're encouraged to build close to one another and can't simply turtle (but too bad if you choose poorly at the start of the game -- you're in for a long, frustrating experience!). The way magic works is cool, the race abilities are varied and seem to be fun, and I think you simply MUST learn how to use those abilities to maximize your performance. 

There is a lot of variability in the races chosen, the random bonus tiles in the game, and the random selection and order of the per-turn scoring tiles. No wonder it was such a hit at Essen! The one downside for me, and after a bunch of plays exploring the various races it could turn out to be a major one, is the complete lack of any randomness after the initial game setup: I tend to like a _little_ bit of randomness in my favorite games (e.g., the cards in Twilight Struggle or Through the Ages, the production rolls in Age of Steam).

--- Summary ---
[u]Setup[/u]
- Shuffle the bonus cards and remove 6-n at random; place the rest (n+3) on display. Also, all Favor tokens and the 10 town tiles are available in display.
- Place 6 random scoring tiles on the turn track; these show ways to earn bonus VP that turn (e.g., dig, build dwellings), as well as bonuses earned at the end of the turn depending on players' positions on one of the cult tracks (e.g., for every space on the earth track, earn a coin).
- Choose random start player
- In turn order, players choose a race; the associated player mat has places for nearly all their wooden bits (all but their priests and bridges) and shows starting workers, coins, and/or priests, the initial distribution of 12 power tokens, and a summary of their two unique race powers (one becomes available only when the Stronghold is built)
- Players place their track markers on the starting spaces of the shipping and digging tracks, the specified spaces of the 4 cult tracks, and the 20VP space
- Switchback style, players place their starting dwelling(s) (take from left side of player mat) onto their home terrain spaces on the board
- In reverse turn order, players take one of the bonus cards (these generally increase your income; some give you VP at the end of your turn, or give you an extra action option during the turn); add 1 coin to the remaining 3 bonus cards.

[u]Overview[/u]
6 rounds:
- Income: as players build structures, icons are revealed on their player boards = income in coins, workers, priests, or power (move power tokens from bowl 1 to 2, then 2 to 3). In addition, the players' bonus cards may provide additional income.
- Actions: in turn order, players take one action or pass; the first player to pass becomes Start Player for the next round. If passing, some bonus cards may earn the player VP. Players immediately choose a new bonus card, returning their previous one.
- Cleanup: players earn bonuses based on the current turn's score card and their positions on the matching cult track, then flip the card over; add 1 coin to the 3 remaining bonus cards

[u]Actions[/u]
- (Terraform and) Build: transform terrain adjacent to any of your structures, paying with shovels (number based on how far it is from your home terrain) which you acquire by spending workers (1-3 per, depending on your status on your digging track); you may transform to intermediate terrains. To build, pay workers and coins (as indicated on your mat) to place one dwelling on a space adjacent to one of your pieces that is in a space of your home terrain type. Shipping and bridges make hexes further away "adjacent".
- Upgrade: player mats show costs for upgrading a Dwelling to Trading Post; TP to either Temple or Stronghold; Temple to Sanctuary. When building Temp or Sanct, immediately take one of the available Favor tokens (advance on associated cult track; may give you additional income or powers for the rest of the game).
- Tech Advance: advance on shipping or digging tracks, paying shown costs (coins, workers, priests) and immediately earning the VP shown
- Cult: send priest to one of 4 available numbered (2 or 3) spaces, immediately advancing that many steps on the track; passing over some spaces immediately earns you power. NOTE: the final space (10) only accommodates one player's token, and may only be unlocked if you have formed a town - one town per cult track 
- Power Action: there are 6 available spaces on the board, each available once per round; spend power (from bowl 3) to take one of these (to earn coins, workers, or priest; place bridge; or dig 1 or 2 shovels worth, which may be supplemented with your own workers
- Special Action: may be earned from bonus cards, favor tiles, or race abilities (when Stronghold is built)
-[b]NOTES[/b]
... whenever you build or upgrade, players with structures adjacent may earn power: x = sum of the levels (1-3) of their adjacent buildings; may pay x-1 VP to earn x power.
... Cultists rule change: if no one chooses to take power when you build/upgrade, you gain 1 power (instead of a temple step). 
... if you build a group of 4 or more directly adjacent (i.e., may not use shipping) structures with 7+ total levels (Dwellings are level 1, Trading Posts and Temples level 2, Strongholds and Sanctuaries level 3) they form a town: select one of the available town tiles, earn the indicated bonuses (VP and either cult advances, coins/workers/priest, or power)
... whenever needed, you may spend power in bowl 3 to earn coins, workers, or priests; also, may burn x power (remove those tokens from the game) from bowl 2 to move x power tokens from bowl 2 to bowl 3
... freely convert priests to workers or workers to coins

[u]End of Game[/u]
After 6 rounds (no cult bonuses at end of 6th round)
- Final VP (for ties, divide points between players):
... For largest contiguous grouping (shipping and bridges can be used): 18-12-6 VP for 1st-2nd-3rd
... For each cult track: 8-4-2 VP for 1st-2nd-3rd highest
- Convert all resources to coins, then earn 1VP per 3 coins
Most VP wins!

Terra mystica, I may not be entirely sure how to pronounce it, but I damn sure know how to play it! Or maybe I don't, considering the fact that I usually lose. But, you know what? It doesn't matter, because I still LOVE playing it! Terra mystica will seduce you with its Wiley charms while it simultaneously torments you with its brain clawing decisions of sacrifice and balance! Like a succubus it will blind you with its glamour and its promise of cunning play, but once it has you ensnared it will feast upon your very soul! Okay, maybe I got a little carried away, let's just say its the ultimate game of give and take, of sacrificing one good for another good, of balance and synergy of yin and yang, of 
Laverne and Shirley, its mind bogglingly AWESOME! And the best part is that there is no luck involved! Whatsoever! If you lose its entirely your fault! There are no dice Gods to thank or blame, there are no card draws to praise or curse! Its just you versus your own mind (and your opponents minds of course) you win or lose based on your own merits, hallelujah! What's that you say? You enjoy chaotic randomness and luck controlling your destiny? Then you can go straight to hell! You shouldn't even be allowed to play Terra mystica, for you are unworthy of its magnificence! In fact, I hereby forbid you to read this review, go grab a random dice game and be gone! Good.....now that those idiots are gone let me share a little secret with you...TERRA MYSTICA IS A GAMING GODSEND! Not since chess has there been a game that delivers this much of a brain fueled competitive orgy of thought provoking gameplay! Yes, its that good, its a cornucopia of mechanics served on platters of pure strategy! Yes, I love it, yes, if you value pure gaming euphoria you will love it too. And no, I don't hate all dice games

Tense and highly replayable - even my non-gaming friends enjoy it.

It is essentially resource management with a thin vale of fantasy. There's so much room for strategy that it never becomes boring.

The game only allows limited player interaction, but this does provide a continuous sense of progress and safety.

There are some games I swear were designed just for me.  This is one of those games and I knew I would love it before I ever even played it.

First of all, this game is "no-luck", which is out of the norm for me because I like a little bit of chaos and random elements in my games but this one is just so perfectly designed.  Like another of my favorite games, Mage Knight Board Game, this game perfectly blends several different game mechanics into one elegantly balanced experience.  There is area control, resource management, structure building and upgrading, worker placement-ish action selection, and variable player powers.

The variable player powers are what gives this game its teeth for me.  I love playing different races with different starting resources, building costs, and special abilities.  It gives the game variety and the fantasy theme gives it amazing charm.  The mechanic of terraforming surrounding areas into your "home" area so you can build on it feels original and exciting as well.

The amount of strategy there is to mine from this game is bottomless.  There are always costs and benefits to every action.  For example, there are some buildings that cost less when upgrading next to your opponents, however they get the same benefit, acquire power when you build next to them (which has its own cost/benefit since you need to sacrifice victory points to acquire this power), and might also cut you off from certain spaces.  Another example is you can sacrifice some power to move an equal amount into the "usable" 3rd bowl immediately, however this lowers the total power you can acquire to use abilities...but it also increases the rate at which you can recharge the 3rd bowl.

There is also a separate "cult" track to progress on, bonus points acquired for certain actions each turn, power chips that give you special bonuses for upgrading to certain buildings, competition for first player who also gets to select a special bonus for the next round first, and so much more that I can't even type it all here.

The components are also of the highest quality.  The boards are all beautiful and sturdy.  The wooden components are thick and really give a great sense of scale with the best buildings being large chunky boulders compared to the infantile dwellings.

The only (minor) criticism I would levy on this game is it is very fiddly.  There are a lot of moving pieces and it takes a while to set up and break down.  It is also a pretty heavy game (gameplay wise although also literally) so it's not going to be for everybody and even more hardcore gamers might be lost the first couple times they play trying to wrap their heads around the plethora of content in front of them.

My favorite "war/strategy/world" game. Every game is drastically different with the expansion changing up the win conditions and even without the expansion with 14 races it will always be different. Very balanced and sometimes it is hard to tell who is winning so people generally don't get discouraged early. Fantastic and meaty

Pretty engaging but has a lot of things to keep track of. I won my first game but I felt like I wasn't paying much attention to what my opponents were doing besides the things that they did to affect board state because I was too preoccupied with thinking about how to manage my resources most efficiently and I felt that I sort of chanced into making early game plays that happened to hurt my opponents. I later understood how it is that I won but that only happened after the game was over.

RATING: 6
Quite approachable for a gamers game. Looking forward to repeated plays. 

The races and random bonus and scoring set up create small but crucial differences to each game. What might work in one game could be hopeless in the next. The game gives large sign posts in the scoring and bonuses and special powers - they need to be exploited, though what I like about the game is that you can make the odd detour for tactical reasons.

Thati have no clue at all how to play some of the races is testimony to the depth and replayability of the game. 

What I have not figured out is why the game is so enjoyable yet appears programmable given the race powers and starting bonus/scoring.

7 games in and whilst I still really enjoy the game I do feel as if each game is a quite tactical battle, reprising the same tune in a different key. The skill and enjoyment seems to be in timing the use of the different 'currencies', all slightly differentiated by the races

Terra Mystica was on my list for must try games a while back, but I sold the first copy I bought for a large profit. It was months before I could pick up another copy. I do like the healthy glut of races with different powers and that each race will have a separate path for building. Some take longer to develop, others must rush their stronghold in turn one to remain competitive via the use of their power. 

There is an excellent amount of variety in the box, but I feel the game was really hurt by the inclusion of only one map. There is also some serious imbalance with the races, with some being so bad that you will not win with them against even competent players. I am very intrigued by the bowls of power concept and hope a similar mechanic worms it's way into other games. 

I could likely have overlooked the above flaws and rated Terra Mystica a 9, but one problem crops up often enough to deflate the game for me. Your initial placement is extremely important to the point that doing it wrong will lose you the game even before it begins. Even with this warning, I have seen players fail time and time again after the "first play" game. Sometimes it is their fault because they isolate and don't build near anyone else, but other times they do and people just abandon that area or rarely upgrade there, assuring those players a bad game. This is not always easy to judge until it's too late, and it has soured me a bit on the game not because it happens to me, but because it can be such a bad experience for the players who get caught in it that they don't want to play again, shrinking my player base. Because of this, Terra Mystica is only a solid 7.

This is your typical victory point soup euro, which have become so popular as of late (2013).
I don't particularly like that trend in euros, because clever player interaction is being replaced by (clever, I guess) system optimisation. Al this game does is presenting the players with a puzzle they need to solve as efficiently as possible. The puzzles look different because of the large number of different races. But that's lie saying sudokus are endessly variable beacause each one has the starting numbers in different places.

I kinda enjoyed my one play, but wouldn't mind never to play this again.

It's really dry with no theme whatsoever.  A big mash up of déjà vu mechanics about resources conversion and bland tracks.
There's no build up because every time you upgrade something you lose something, but it helps keep the game short (with the predetermine 6 rounds).

On the other hand, you can really do what you want when it's your turn (with the choice of 8 possible actions) and it's not necessarily the same thing as your neighbors.

I don't get people comparing this to Eclipse.  This game is more related to Hansa Teutonica and just like HT it will be forgotten in a year.
A big meh for me.

Comparisons to Hansa Teutonica seem warranted because the style of play is so similar: individual micro-turns, uncovering a board with different wooden bits that grant access to new powers, light spatial play with strong leeching, many competing ways to score, many ways to specialize or focus to maximize those scoring methods. The bonus here is the vast variety and replayability: not only is every faction different, elements such as bonus tiles also change each round.

It's an easy game to like. It's not opaque and it's got nothing particularly novel to it; it's just complex and rock solid. The combination of spatial placement (including blocking), development and variety is right up my alley. It has at least enough replayability to get through every race, some of which require very different approaches. My only real worry is that it won't get the level of play it needs to shine.

At first i thought this would be another area control game.
Fortunately this is not the case.

It definitely has an area control element but the game is not all about this.

This feels more like a city building euro with many different paths to explore each time.
Choices and playstyle are influenced by your faction's special abilities and by each turn's scoring conditions and bonuses.

Some might say the interaction is low. I disagree.
Although there is not direct conflict like combat, there is a lot of competition going on for the cult track,terraforming,power actions and largest empire.
This amount of interaction is enough for me.

Overall i found it a nice game and i would like to play with every faction once just to find out how they play.

Only if you screwed it already in the beginning, before actually playing, when placing your start locations - this should be avoided.

In Terra Mystica, players govern one of 14 factions seeking to terraform and colonize the landscape in their favor in order to build structures and preserve their race and culture. Upgrade structures to provide even more resources, like workers, priests, money, and power, erect temples to gain expanded influence in the four cults of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air, and fortify your stronghold to activate your group's special ability. Will your people prosper, persevere, and stand the test of time in Terra Mystica!

Every game is slightly different

Tactical game, a lot

Nicely done components

The only randomness in the game is before ANY decisions are made, therefore winning this game is 100% skill

It takes about 30 min per player + 15 min setup time (usually)

You need to teach a man a lesson before first play of this game, but the reference cards are very useful here

So much to do, infinitely replayable, has a LOT of rules but most are very intuitive and once you know how the game plays out they make a lot of sense; also the boards are filled with visual aid to show you what is what.

The initial disconnect between the cult track and the rest of the game isn't as big as I thought since they basically relate to temples/sanctuaries so your mind will automatically connect them after some games.

Finally played and got to see what all the buzz is about. After an initial feeling of being overwhelmed (the game is punishing on newbies), this title still failed to live up to its hype.

It's a long game and the theme is horribly mismatched here. I worry too that the chosen faction will pretty much determine the player's strategy.

This is one of those rare occasions where it just seems that there is too much going on with the design.

I can see why it's so popular, but not a game for me - no desire to play again.

What's interesting about this game is that, despite the complexity of the rules and the long explanation it requires to teach it to people, most people seem to get it by the end of the first round and move from trying to score points now to attempting a longer term strategy based on the race they've received. They probably won't win, but they'll feel like they can see what they did wrong and how to improve next time. There seems to be something intuitive about the way all the elements fit together that allow people to latch on to the rules and strategy quickly, despite the complexity.

Best heavy Eurogame out there!

3-5 players, best 4. 60-150 mins.  Weight near 4 so complicated like war of ring!
At first, the game can feel a bit overwhelming with its many possible actions, rules and different faction powers (which often act as exceptions to rules). The actions themselves aren’t complicated or difficult, there are just a lot of them and it is hard at first to maintain a good overview. It is also easy to forget one of the many little details. Teaching the game will take about 30-45 minutes. 
Playing it can also be a long experience; 25-35 minutes per experienced player is realistic, but be warned: Terra Mystica has no randomness during the game at all. There are no dice rolls or card draws, the game is completely deterministic. In my experience, this leads to people thinking longer about their moves because they are able to calculate more accurately. Without randomness, there is less of a “let’s see how this works out”-attitude towards a game, so be warned that players prone to analysis paralysis can turn Terra Mystica into a 4 hour game (5 with a rules explanation), especially if they are new to the game.

For me it is the perfect balance between optimizing my own economy while also having to fight with other players for positions and actions.

Incredible replay value because the setup is different every game, and there are 14 unique factions to play (with six more in the expansion). It takes 14 games just to try each faction once, and then you want to play more to figure out how each faction can be played optimally, and in which setup they perform best.

Can be played online at terra.snellman.net, and there is even a tournament at tmtour.org.

Excellent city/network building euro. Lots of competition over map space, public actions, and "most-of" scoring goals. A little overdesigned - it seems that there are a lot of mechanical subsystems that were just bolted on for the sake of having more. Comes with over a dozen races that each play very differently due to variable player powers and build costs. Are they balanced? Probably not, but it's close enough to not matter so much.

I've barely scratched the surface of this. 14 different factions to play, variable scoring and bonus set ups provide a lot of variety to the game.

Each player control a race of people, each with their own unique powers, and has to spread their areas across the board by using terraforming (to transform areas to their particular land type of choice) and through the construction of buildings (introducing extra benefits thereby making expansion easier). Players also need to use power from their individual pool and progress along four different cult tracks to aid their effort. Victory points are awarded for several accomplishment e.g. having built the largest town, placing a certain type of building on a given turn, progressing furthest along a particular cult track etc. There are numerous paths to victory and there's an awful lot going on at any one time to try and keep track of (perhaps one or two too many aspects making it difficult to strategise at times) but I admire the way this game works without resorting to direct conflict and the diversity in which a player can approach the game.

There are very few euros that are totally awesome but this is one of them. Even if you don't like euros I think this is one worth checking out.
My initial impression was that this was pretty complex but the more I think about it more I think this is a big, dumb game. And I love it! Or it might just be that there is a thematic and logical flow to the game and the designers didn't purposefully obfuscate things with silly resource conversion systems so that I think it's simpler than it really is. Regardless there's plenty of strategy, tactics and tough decisions to keep everyone engaged. There's no take that elements and only a little action and location denial. I do wish there was a second map but the variety of races will keep the game engaging for a while.
Production and theme are wonderfully handled though the box art is less impressive.
Unfortunately my love of big, long games (by euro standards) isn't universally shared so if I do buy this it won't get as much play as I would like.

You need two turns to get into the rules, after that it plays smooth. But you will need min. 1 game to get the feeling how to score well.

I just like when there is so many options that you can go for and not enough resources to do all of them. It is AP prone but I do not have problems with that. With so many factions you have plenty of options of different plays, if you play 2 player games tough some combinations do not go well (i.e swarmlings vs chaos magicians) but more you play more you learn and can get the best out of the even worse factions. I do not mind the lack of theme it is the mechanic that talks here. Great game

Played a demo at Essen 2012. Game was sold out already, and did reject a 'blind buy' for €50,-. 

However, this game really deserves it's praise at is very well designed, and great to play. Felt drawn in, and I don't experience that a lot with a worker placement game.

Great game. Fan of euro's definitely should check this out. Predict this could be the next top 20 game on BGG [25-10-2012] within a few months, when it gets broader appeal.

[Edit 09-03-2013] Pulled the trigger and pre-ordered a copy. Dutch copy, if anyone wants to trade their first edition English/German one for it please contact me.

I love this one, the variety among the different races is impressive: you can play it over and over again and you'll never get the same result. The paths to victory are many, all equally effective. It also allows you to play tricky strategies (like building two close cities to get double victory points and then unite them in the last turn to obtain a massive settlement...). The rules are easy enough to be learned by everyone without much confusion, but playing the game can reach various degrees of complexity that make it really long-living.

FIRST GAME: The strange thing is that even if you have all the choice of the world, you should follow the path of your race. This is something that I hate. 3 hours of play, following something of necessary to be done. :(

SECOND GAME: Things start to move well. The race I took today (Nomads) was nice and the rules are more fixed in my mind. This game is heavy and could lead to headache, but it's worth.

Beautiful components, intuitive gameplay that flows smoothly.  Game mechanics are fairly easily picked up after a round or two of play, but there is great enough strategic depth to satisfy heavy gamers.  It is ridiculously deep, and it5 has TONS of replayability!

This *was* my favorite game (for 5 years). *More edits* 50+ plays in, the game was every bit as good.

Simply the best boardgame ever designed, bar none.  Period.
*Or so it was -- supplanted by Gaia Project for certain, but Three Kingdoms Redux may also have a slight edge.

tl;dr: masterpiece

This game took off like a rocket when it came out. And people are still playing it way more than most games from 2012. And that was an EXCELLENT year with other masterpieces like [thing=119432][/thing], [thing=122515][/thing] and [thing=126163][/thing]! Man, what a year!!! There is a good reason why people are still playing this as much as they are despite the lack of new expansions: the game is very replayable out of the box and is a fucking good game! The different races and the way all the different game elements interact gives you an immense amount of game to explore, and each time is very enjoyable. And once you know the game, it's very doable to finish this in under two hours, which, for a game this deep, is very nice.
Yeah, this is a masterpiece, I'm so glad I get to play it every time I do.

First time..Played with four others. Looked fun, I like worker placement but it felt like I was playing a game of solitaire for the most part. At one point I left the room for a bit. Came back and three others had played. I didn't even need to know what they did, nothing really effected me that much during the game. Blah. And it took 40 minutes to read all the rules. Ended up finishing 2nd, which is funny. I know I part of the problem is the way that they taught me but this game was just terrible for me. Probably just not my style.

First play was disorienting.  Lots of stuff going and timing of when to do things is obviously very important.  Viable player powers every where also added to my confusion.  Seems to be a very good game and I mostly enjoyed the play, but will need more time with it to properly judge.

RATING: 6
quite abstract - theme feels totally pasted on the game engine. Engine works well, even if I don´t like it (powerwheels, culttracks etc.) There is not much interaction between the players either. In theory you have a lot of actions in the game, but in reality the game forces you to act in the most point generating way. Due to the  few turns until the game ends, there is no room for real individual strategy. It melts down to determinate  how to get the most points with the individual strengh-bonus of your race and do than EXACT these actions in EXACT the right order. If you are ok at maths, you can calculate the outcome of the game after turn 3 or 4. My main problem with the game is, that it deliveres no story and no joyfull experience. I don´t feel like building a fantasy-empire, it´s just plain optimizing the pointgenerating engine. Therefore: for what it deliveres it is to long and adds unneccesary layers of complexity... but nice wooden bits though...

RATING: 6
It's interesting, but it's overly complex for what it wants to do.
I guess it wants to be a luck-free strategic game with advanced complexity and a thin fantasy theme.
I like the theme of fantasy races, although the game is quite abstract.
Asymmetric player powers are always great, and in this game it's done in an elaborate way. Every race has numerous properties that differ from the other races. It's neat, but also a lot stays more or less the same.
The idea of the terraforming is brilliant and adds a bit of special flavor to the game.
The materials look great. I like those massive wooden blocks of different shapes that represent different types of buildings, abstract but fitting.

What's not so great?:
- The "workers" look like stone bricks.
- 14 races but not every combination is possible (That's because every race is bound to a color and a terrain type, and there are two for each color.)
- not enough interaction between players
- expensive
- Do the races really feel different in gameplay?
- It feels like there is something missing in the game, that it could be better if it was designed a little bit differently.
- There are a lot of options what you can do, but usually not many that are good in a certain situation. So the game more or less pushes you in a direction and by that limits your decision making. Also, the races more or less dictate a main strategy that works best with the given race. And usually resources are very tight which further limits your decisions.
- The races aren't fully balanced. (There are auctioning rules in the expansion to mitigate that, but it works only for very experienced players who know exactly what the races are "worth" in a given situation.)
- Where are fun aspects? (Well, not by cool interaction and not by smooth and elegant gameplay, and the building aspect isn't all that great either. The theme is thin, and the luck-free competition aspect is not what I would call fun, and frankly, it isn't superb.)

in short:
+ fantasy theme with terraforming
+ many races with numerous different properties
+ good materials (and lots of them)
+ round tiles and bonus tiles make you think a little bit differently every game
0 luck-free strategy (not sure if I really like that)
- overly complex(!) and a bit too abstract
- not enough player interaction
- a strong feeling that it could have been made better
- expensive
- not really fun(!)

Many choices, but easy rules. No randomnes in one play, but high replaybility (different races, bonus tiles and turn tiles in every game). Many ways to get points. Turns should be fast (you make one action, than the next player has his turn), but sometimes there is some downtime (you must plan not only your current move, but also some next). The races are really very different.

Player boards in some way similar to Hansa Teutonica, but it is a different game. But like in Hansa Teutonica the theme is not very high.

A dice-less, moderately heavy game with tons of decisions to make. No turn ever feels like a waste, and every move feels expensive and important. I think the aesthetic could be a little better. Playing one race over the other emphasizes how you end up scoring points, which can make certain parts of the game less or more important. There is a strong dichotomy around playing next to other players, because it helps both you and them cycle your abilities in the game. Do I upgrade and help other players, or can I find another way to score points? If you have 3-4 hours to play, it's definitely worth it.

I had to give a bad vote.
Why?
Because the outcome of this game is more or less defined during the first steps, by choosing races and placememt. After that you convert things from one to the other hoping that the game will end. No tension, utterly predictable and boring.

It was hard to give the bad vote.
Why?
The game designers did so well in some ways. The blending of some game mechanics is very well done. The rules are complex but yet easy to learn. The graphics support the intuitive understanding of the rules.

So the worst thing for me: with all the hype the game got, there is no way these guys will change their efforts.

If my vote would just reflect the fun i had (better say didn't have) playing this game it had to be a 1.

I love diceless games, this is one of those games where there is very little random, but a lot of social engineering , there is a slight vs. mechanics in the game, but no actually squimish rather blocking actions. "I do this, now you can't do that" - kind of actions - but you're never really eliminated and you have a few ways to catch up even though others think you're behind. - buy the expansion and ignore the new races :D

Winner is determined by points, and there are lots of different ways to gather those points.  The various factions have different requirements and abilities, but I found it easy to play this game and not be aware of who the various races were. Some well-designed mechanisms, but overall  I find it weakly themed. 
I like to have more of a goal-oriented experience, but this one's goals are too scattered and I find it a rather empty gaming experience.

Probably better on replay, with more familiarity. I want to like Terra Mystica, but unlike other games it actually rewards analysis paralysis, because it's built around a very tight engine. My few plays of Terra Mystica have therefore felt more exhausting than actually fun, especially since everyone's just sitting around silently grinding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid eurogame. Clearly inspired by Hansa Teutonica. However Hansa Teutonica is still a better game. Terra Mystica, although streamlined, still adds a lot of fiddliness that HT doesn't have (or need). So even though this is a great game, I will always choose to play HT instead.

RATING: 6
Complex game, theme is a bit tacked on, and would have been better with a space theme (terraforming), the fantasy races dont really fit imo.  No denying its a well thought out game, but can be a bit overwhelming and seem a bit like work.  This is not a game i would call "fun". I think the wooden buildings could have been a bit more inspired and the cult tracks just feel tacked on. The races are also unbalanced.  Playing this made me yearn for euros of old.

Not one to pull out with noobs!

For a similar weight game i prefer Keyflower, Trajan etc.

RATING: 10
Simply amazing. Incredible, incredible game. An elegant puzzle, a complex, synergistic, interwoven connection of actions and mechanics that create a rich engine building game like no other. No luck, however variable player powers, but which make for varied and interesting play and can be balanced. Player interaction is a little minimal but the gameplay encourages it, and the more players the more interactivity will ensue. For me this game is like a work of art, and decoding it is pure joy. And yet the puzzle is matched with complex possibilities on the board, with players stealing actions, potentially boxing other players into a corner, and mutually benefiting one another through close expansion, which can be both helpful and dangerous. 

Personally though, the engine building is where this really shines. Every action and every construction will greatly affect the way your engine functions and what you produce. Sacrifices are encouraged, and will need to be made for efficiency. You really get a sense of it's construction as you go through the game, while at the same time having to make difficult decisions whether to build the engine or go for points. A good Euro forces that decision on you at every turn, and Terra Mystica does just that.

EDIT:
Tried it again, still hated it.  It's really just glued together mechanics with a pasted on theme.  So I can move pink energy around my 3 bowls and move my meeple down a hallway for points... I thought we were building cities? I'm not even that much into theme in my games, but that whole 4 paths thing seemed like an afterthought and everything felt clunky. Even that neighbor bonus felt wonky to me. This game just really rubs me the wrong way.

This title is all the rage with several members of my game group, but my reaction has been much more tepid. There's a lot going on, and everything works well. The game certainly rewards experience and having a cohesive strategy going in. I do like the game's depth, but for whatever reason, it just doesn't grab me. Perhaps it's just a bit too dry and abstract for my tastes. Gets a "7" rating for its clever design but no more, as it lacks charm, flavor and fun.

Great game if it fits your desired gaming style. Euro game with lots of strategy. Some peoples complaints are that some of the races are a little unbalanced but its kind of what makes it fun for me.

I think this game is overrated.  The rules take forever to get through and game play just isn't that fun in my opinion.  We pulled this one out the other night and were all reminded why it had been on closet patrol for over a year.  

I know this game is popular and very well ranked on bgg but I must be missing something because I have yet to see the appeal of this game.

Update: After a handful of more plays this game is showing more promise.  Increasing rating to an 8.  I'm starting to appreciate all the thought that went into balancing the different races with their unique capabilities.

RATING: 9
Really an entertaining game.  Thematically similar to Smallworld in art playing with many races who are asymmetrical. Gameplay is hard to explain, but definitely resource gathering mixed with a little bit of worker placement and area control.  You are basically building your races realm while your opponents do the same.  The board looks great as there are 5 different sized "city structures" for each race.  The catch is your race can only survive on one type of land, and so you are using your resources to "terra form" or change the land to a type that is hospitable to your race.  Scoring throughout the game, with the ability to sacrifice VP's through the game for power tokens to use is a neat addition.  Final scoring can making scoring a lot closer then you realize. Really a fun game.  3:15 for first play after rules with 5 players.  Easily could see cutting 30 mins off that time with repeat plays.

Rating after two plays. Very good game, well designed. A lot of rules to digest at first, but once you play, the gameplay is actually quite simple but deep. Very deep. Brain burning deep. This is not quite my taste at the moment, so "only" a 7.

RATING: 7
Terra Mystica is an impressive design.  It's a hodgepodge of player actions and VP scoring but it all works together seamlessly and organically.  The plethora of actions -- and sequences of actions -- would normally mean a complex game and bewildering initial experience.  That's not the case here.   The superb graphic design and lack of exceptions to the rules make it surprisingly easy to grasp and play. 

But it's not perfect.  There is an almost total disconnect between the theme of the game and player actions or VP scoring, which is unfortunate.  The requirement of upgrading magic before it can be spent, for example, is a very unique mechanism for limiting one of the game's form of resources.  But then magic is spent pretty much the same way as workers or gold or priests (and can even be converted into these other resources) and so it ends up feeling like "purple reources" and not at all like "magic."  It's clever, but not thematic.  The "now, for just this round, doing this action will be worth VP" is also pretty lazy, thematically speaking (and I'd rather not have the game herd players into particular tactics).

The game could also use a greater degree of player interaction.  I'd love to be able to compete for spaces in a way beyond the Settlers of Catan model of "you snooze, you lose" area control.

Regardless of its faults, this is a game I hope I have a chance to explore more thoroughly.

RATING: 8.5
This is the game where there's just too much of "there's too little/too few of...". You always have the feeling that you're running short on workers, you're never close to having enough priests when you need them, money is always very tight and lore/might - don't even ask about it! You DON'T have it. And even if you're in the unlikely but favorable position to have some, it's spent sooner than you think. So think about spending it thrice/"quadrupleth"/"sillywordwith5...th"! Upgrading your buildings will give you some of the resources you're craving for, but not without reducing other resources you earn. And with more than 2 players the space you can expand into will most likely be brawled over too. Take the "turn-angstiest" game you know and multiply it by a billion: The result is not Terra Mystica, because you only multiplied it by a lousy billion! ;-)

Now despite being such a brainburner, the game plays very smoothly. I'd say you can explain it in about 20-25 minutes. There's some potential for downtime, but I wouldn't call it downtime. You'll be thankful for the moments when your opponents take some more time to think about their decision because you will be busy thinking all the time about your possible next move(s) and their timing. 
So is Terra Mystica deserving all the hype? No! Because calling it a hype would imply I think the game is wrongly and artificially boosted. If you askme, if Terra Mystica is deservant of its PRAISES, I'd have to go with a "Yes". 
I think the game is on a par with other great Euro games like Caylus (and no, they don't have anything in common) and has the potential to become one of the Euro Games classics. I'm very keen to try this with 3,4 and 5 players.

A modern classic. Such good design and an experience that gives you so many meaningful choices in a relatively short space of time that it's hard to find fault with it. Not everyone's bag though I will say that; it's brutally punishing if you make mistakes and has almost no luck at all... magnificent! :)

RATING: 10
Excellent. The game is just fun to play, and the different player powers make it a different experience every time.

I also want to commend the iconography and built-in reminders. There's a lot going on in this game, but I haven't had to reference the rulebook at all after the first play. Everything just makes sense and is easy to remember because of the graphic reminders on the player boards and the main board. What do I get during the income phase? Just look for the hand icon. How much do I pay to build this? Just look at your player board. How many points for end-game scoring? Just look at the main board. What are my options on a turn? Look at your reference card. Great design, great layout, great game.

Update: I've now had this game since around the time it came out and I've played it several times with different groups. It's still a definite 10. This is the perfect "heavy" game for me. Some games (such as those by Vital Lacerda or What's Your Game) are complicated just for the sake of being complicated. Terra Mystica is heavy in the sense that there is no randomness (outside of the initial setup) and there are several different elements in play at all times. The difference, though, is that in TM everything flows smoothly and just makes sense. There are none of those "fiddly" rules that I hate and overall the game is pretty easy to explain.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4-5[/b]
Two players doesn't work, and the game is just okay with three. You really need 4-5 to tighten up the board and the fight for territory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I hope you like managing resources. I do. I love that the only luck is the in the setup and the rest is all skill. The 8 actions you can choose from are each interesting in their own way and figuring out how to get them to work best with your faction is both challenging and rewarding. The asymmetry of the factions is both a plus and a minus. Adds variety and colors the game but some factions are definitely better than others off the bat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What more can you want from an Asymmetrical Euro with high levels of player interactivity but no feeling of randomness or "screwage" because of it? The game feels perfect after two plays. Each race is unique and allows for variable strategies.

The game requires you to be both tactile and strategic in your gameplay. If you don't adjust to your opponents you may miss out on opportunities, but you can't lose sight of your long term goals for end game points.

I really like this game. The way it combines a sort-of-fantasy theme with an all-out-Euro ruleset is spot on for me as a Euro guy. The factions add a ton of variety to explore and discover. I'm sure they'll come out with more factions in expansions too--it's just seems too easy they'd be crazy not to.

I love the way there's a bit of a race element, but how well you do is determined by how well you play to your faction's strength and to how the score cards are lined up in the turn display. I also like seeing all the scoring cards for the whole game immediately from set up.

I have a lot to learn; my 8.5 rating is only after one play. I suspect it will rise as long as it continues to impress with more plays.

The artwork and mechanics of the game are fantastic. I can see it being fairly easy to teach with maybe just one more play under my belt. 

Good game. I'm glad I have it.

3/4/13 - Bumping my initial rating from 8.5 to a 9. I suspect it will only rise with more plays. I really like it. My second play was brilliantly fun, even with two players. If you like challenging Euros with a mix of everything and a unique feel, this game is it for 2013!

6/27/13 - Bumping my rating from a 9 to a 9.5. It is officially one of my favorite games. I'm thinking in my top 5 for sure, possibly top 3 currently. The more I play it game, the more I like it. I love the way it rewards playing to your faction's strength. It makes it endlessly replayable and deep. 

Fantastic game with a unique feel that's both challenging, and rewarding.

I will second another user's comment that this is Kingdom Builder on crack. This is a euro full of euroness for sure.

My favorite Euro and strategy game in the whole world.  So much complexity and different ways to play.  Between the different races and changing round goals, there is enough variability to keep this fresh with each play.  The ONLY thing that keeps this from being my no 1 favorite game all time (instead of Agricola) is that Agricola has a solo feature for me to play when I'm bored.  Take some time to watch a few vids on how to play, read the instructions thoroughly, and let your first play take some time to get through.  Soon, you'll love it.

This has fell flat for me each time I tried it.  It's too abstract while pretending it's thematic.  I feel like the tactical decisions are fairly obvious.  You set a longer term strategy and then kind of auto pilot.  The cult board and cult favors seem really tacked on.  This is a game I should love on paper but so far I just haven't been gripped by it, and suspect I never will be.

That said the rules, mechanics, production quality are all great.

A well designed interactive heavy euro with working variability.

Pros. High player interaction, fun mechanics that create constant tough decisions, unbelievable variety and replayability, a plethora of different strategies for each of the races, great flow of play, minimum luck (if any), small goals that create a sense of fullfilment throughout the game, a great sense of accomplishment and multiple competitive sectors for end game scoring (4 temples & the kingdom). This game even has a working theme.

Cons. The theme is pasted (I personally dislike fantasy themed games which means it's a poor package for me) plus it's a heavy game that is fairly difficult to play and less forgiving to mistakes. There are way too many mechanisms for me in this game, as I personally tend to like more simple designs.

Excellent game for those who love heavy euros, decent game for all. It's a game that has grown on me with every play, as the combination of great variability and complex, rewarding mechanisms is a killer one. Every game feels like completely new with the variable factions, mini goals and the combination of all, while the heavy mechanisms become more and more intuitive and the interaction steadily keeps you alert. Well done.

What I like:

-I enjoy the thinking aspects of this game - fun brain teaser
-The races are very different and encourages very different playing styles making it more replayable.
-I'm impressed that I didn't feel annoyed by the games interaction (I thought the encouragement to build close together would force more "Haha, I take this spot from you now" moments, but it did not feel that bad at all)


What I do not like:

-Oh my God it's so dry! And so ugly! Urgh that board! Absolutely no theme whatsoever and totally unrelated mechanics.
-Would have preferred if it was a bit shorter

I'm not sure what value my comment will help you, as someone reading my comments. It's good.  You will probably like it.  It has a ton of strategy, a ton of variety, slight tweaks making each game different, and so your strategy must vary, but not too much.  The big negatives are its long too teach and to set-up.  It's enjoyable to play, but I think its rating is going to stay at 9.

Very very very cool game that is much deeper than at first one wants to believer it really is. The them of each race to it's costs and special abilities is really well done actually. Sure it could be rethemed but the theme chosen still works very well.

There is less down time in a 2 player game obviously but the board doesn't scale at all for fewer players and I feel this hurts the game. It would be a nice if a specific 2/3 player board were made for the game to keep conflict tight. Needs to work/scale like Small World does basically.

There is a good reason this game is ranked so high (Holy moly, it is up to #2!). It is an excellent game! It does a good job of introducing variability so it doesn't get dry. One problem that I have with many simple Euro games is that after a few plays, the optimal path becomes clear (I will go here, unless they go there, then I go here, etc.). Anyways, TM has variable races and abilities (of which I am a big fan), increasing the variability and the strategic depth. The game is intimidating, and there is a lot to think about, but it is fantastic. You really need to focus on the scoring tiles to plan your future turns as it is easy to get side tracked. Excellent game.

The gem of 2012 which has already become my favorite game- this one has 14 different factions to play, bonus tiles selected after passing, which give a unique advantage for the upcoming round and which increase in value ala Puerto Rico style for those not selected, passing first allows the player to go first in following round, building placement on board reveals increasing incomes as popularized in Eclipse, just the right amount of player interaction in competing on the cult tracks for majority bonuses, mini-actions similar to a rondel without the rondel to keep play flowing at a good pace, and some territorial placement urgency to establish cities on the board. Interesting mechanism to generate "power", a waxing/waning, recycling currency pool which provides flexibility in acquiring the other resources- priests, workers, and money. A bit daunting to learn/teach, but the effort is well worth the time investment. Once through the rules, the play is elegant and intuitive such that review of the rules is rarely necessary. To sum up, those who prefer thematic/Ameritrash designs may want to try before they buy. Eurogame fans can confidently place their preorders- this title packs more strategic depth in a fast-moving, relatively short play time than any has in a long time. Nearly endless variety, not only with the faction choices but also with the varying bonus tiles and the varying round bonus tiles and their varying sequence.

This is a game with an evocative design. Very well integrated mechanics, a lot of choices, and a plethora of options for victory points. The variety of races provide a good debate around if the game is well balanced for each particular setup. Experience players can easily point out that for a given setup, certain races will do worst than others. You just need to recognize which race to choose (there is an option where you pay victory points to select your race first), or use the default setup. This is a gamer's game!

RATING: 8
[thing=120677][/thing] is, by all means, a great euro-game on the side of the medium-heavy ones. The game excels in variability: there are 14 groups/races from which to chose from - and the relation they have with each other are different: some will terraform the land in types closer to your own, so you will want to stay somewhat close, others will change easier terrain to terraform into tough ones, so you might want to stay away. And this is only one of the friction points between the groups/races. This don't mean battle - in [thing=120677][/thing] everything is friendly enough: the construction of the others near your own give you power points (at the cost of victory points) and the trading posts are cheaper to build when they are made near a construction of other groups/races. So this is a game of low confrontation - the dispute happens for the resources, much like in many euros (although not as cutthroat as [thing=31260][/thing] or [thing=18602][/thing]).

Every turn you have a selection of 7 actions to take: terraformation, build, special action, upgrade (buildings, terraforming and ships), pray, use power and pass. These actions usually demand a type of resource: workers, money, priests and powers - these are the currencies in the game. There are plenty ways to gain points and to change the enviroment of the game (you can acquire special tiles that give you one-off things or every round resources; the cities give points and one other thing; the round tiles, that you chose at the start of the game, and change for another everytime you pass, also give the player bonus stuff).

All the game is well crafted: things work in a good flow and the players are always wanting something and doing things - you can have rounds where you didn't do everything you wanted (as usual), but you hardly will have a round where you didn't do anything. Planning goes a long way in [thing=120677][/thing], since the game allows only a tiny amount of randomness - and this comes from the actions of the player, not the game itself - maybe someone terraformed a place you wasn't expecting, or took one of the favor tiles that, to you, don't make sense, or upgrade a build into a Sanctuary when you were sure he/she would change that trading post into a Fortress. Anyway this is part of most (if not all) games.

The theme is almost non-existent, even though the groups/races have abilities that have thematic connection with them - dwarfs dig, alchemists turn things into power, and so forth -, but during play I didn't feel that I was an Alchemists, nor that my opponents were Witches or Chaos Magicians - they were just player that could do some things that I couldn't or do better. I don't require theme in my euro-games, but it would be nice to have more.

The pieces are great and, oh, dear, you get a lot of them. A tree worth of them. The art is also pretty good.

A solid game that deserves the attention that it is getting.

I killed myself getting this for my husband for Christmas 2012, involving a weird underground resistance movement to get it from Germany to the US (none of the OLGS in Europe were allowed to ship to the US and it wasn't going to release in the US in time for Christmas -- it eventually released in July 2013, I think!).  Anyway, the game was totally worth the enormous effort, hit our top 10 in a flash, and hasn't moved down yet :)

Played with five and it was smooth - didn't ever really bog down at all

Lot of choices - need to learn the various race powers as some seemed a bit stronger then others

Look forward to the next play - Initial rating 7.5 and think it will go up, possibly quite a bit

--------------------------------

My last play with 5 was fun but left me feeling kinda empty - still like to play but may not be a go to game .... 

I think to get good and truly unlock the game's potential I would have to spend quite a bit of time playing - and that might not be a commitment I am willing to make on this title.....there are soooo many good games out there - do I only want to play this one exclusively for a bit?  Doubtful

It will see occasional play but probably not much more

This one is a real brain-burner.  It is perfect for anyone that wants pure, unadulterated strategy.  The game is completely deterministic, everything (except for your opponent's actions) is laid out in front of each player, there is no luck involved.  There are so many options on each turn and several different ways to accomplish goals for the turn, and this makes analysis paralysis prevalent (at least for me).  I also wish the theme was a lot stronger.  Sure, you play as fantasy races with different powers and terraform the land so that you have an advantage in certain areas, but it does just feel like moving pieces around on boards following slightly different rules.  There are several rules that simply don't make sense thematically, and the only reason they are there is to balance the game (and it feels artificial).  I think the reason this game is so highly regarded is because there are a ton of pieces to move around.  The implementation is fantastic, especially the player boards and iconography.  There are rules reminders with helpful clues all over this game, so once you play the game once, you'll find that the game is easy to understand and play.  The game is engaging the entire way through, for sure.  Those that enjoy figuring out the best way to maximize their victory points will love it.

A truly phenomenal design. I love playing this game--the only thing that could improve it for me is stronger thematic integration. The systems themselves, however, are so well-designed. The randomized setup ensures variety, but the lack of hidden information thereafter puts a high emphasis on both strategy and tactics.

RATING: 4.5
bloated.  too much going on, and it felt like the side board in particular was 'tacked on'.  others in my group seem to highly disagree, though...  i would FAR rather play Puerto Rico, if i want a complex game.  i read/heard somewhere a comment that to the effect of:  choice of actions does not define strategy.  i would tend to agree.  LOTS TO DO seems to really jazz some players - and this has LOTS TO DO.  but i feel like it is an illusion of sorts - its really feeling like a bunch of mechanisms thrown into the blender.

RATING: 5
previously rated a 4.5.  bumped (for the moment?) to a 5.  i CAN see the appeal, but i still think that there is WAAAAY more going on here than is optimal for the fun quotient.  put another way:  the fun-to-time ratio is OFF and i would rather play Puerto Rico and a couple other games in the 2.5 hours than play this.  

another observation:  there is SO much going on that i often (mostly?) don't know the what i should do, but i can see something good to do.  and i don't mean this is "good complexity"; i still believe that this is a game that "jumped the shark" of complexity.  (e.g., that damn sidboard!  TOO MUCH!)

still, mermaids were fun.

The leviathan is now in the house. In fact, I've been terrified yet strangely drawn to this game since it came out. The mystique surrounding the depth and complexity of it was truly intimidating, but now that we have it in the collection and watched a couple of run thru videos and read the rules, I think the hype is justified but the terror threat isn't. The rules in TM actually make more sense than some supposedly very simple games I read thru recently (Ivor The Engine i'm looking at you!) and all work very logically and the sheer numbers of visual reminders on the player boards is really impressive. Some of the mechanics are devious, like the 'power cycle' bowls. All the systems add together very elegantly to give you a game that is certainly deep and very very to feel your way through what may or may not be the correct strategy for your chosen tribe, but there's nothing that's genuinely 'difficult' as such. It means that once you've got the fairly simple rules under your belt, you can go off, pick up a spade and start digging!

RATING: 6
I like this and find it rewarding and interesting but the long term strategy is lacking.  Look at the bonus tiles and plan around them.  It's kind of fun to do this and see how efficiently you can budget your resources and tactical shots but I'd rather play a pure worker placement game.  Still solid and strong design that I will keep on my shelf, but a little too bloated.  

The worst characteristic of eurogames is that they tell you what to do.  Figure out the puzzle.  This game is exactly that with no rewarding engine.

Rating after one play - might very well rise after the next time we have played it. Very good heavy euro, that combines elements of Eclipse and Hansa Teutonica with original mechanics of its own. In terms of rules there is a lot to take in on first play, but they are intuitive enough to remember and the artwork on the boards really helps to keep overview. Very, very well done. The different races prevent it from becoming too dry and seem to be very well thought out in terms of balance. Buy it if you have a group to play this type of time consuming board games with tons of options with. Looking forward to my next play.

My first play of this was quite simply a revelation. It's been quite evident that at the time of writing this, that we're in the middle of the light to middle-weight Euro revolution. After playing a lot of light to medium-weight games, this wowed me with the various interconnected mechanics and fantastic gameplay. 

The thing was, we played some of the rules wrong and it was still fantastic! I'm so ecstatic that people continue to make games like this! As a slight aside, this game buried Kingdom Builder for me. Whatever interest I had in that game died when I played Terra Mystica.

I can't wait to get to play this more and learn the ins and outs of all the factions. The expansion looks fantastic as well and I can't wait to get my hands on it! What's really crazy is, I actually had this on my shelf for 6 months; I can't believe it sat on my shelf for that long.

Jogão, fantástico. Muitos caminhos para vitória, rejogabilidade maravilhosa, "cobertor curto", ações em sinergia, e uma das coisas q mais gosto em um jogo: te dá opções de estratégia a curto (recursos), médio (pontuação/bônus da rodada) e longo (pontuação por área e culto) prazos simultaneamente. Isso tudo com regras a princípio assustadoras, mas que se tornam simples e orgânicas em 2 ou 3 turnos, com uma iconografia excelente. Li algumas críticas citando que a partir do momento que a pontuação das rodadas e as facções são escolhidas, ele se torna determinístico, pois não há mais aleatoriedadde em jogo. De fato isso pode existir, mas para jogadores profissionais de campeonatos, para reles mortais como nós, calcular isso é doideira, oq vale é o desafio e a diversão, e isso TM tem de sobra!

The 2 player game is great! We're playing 3 games for each match-up so there's enough races in the box to keep us going for a while!

RATING: 9.8
A smart Euro fully deserving of the praise it gets. A creative blend of Kingdom Builder and Puerto Rico. The downside is the number of potential actions you can take each turn is staggering (more than the advertised "8").

It takes about 30 minutes to teach the game even if you've played it a bunch because it's just got so many different concepts. Still, it is clean and pure with its lack of random elements and pure strategic gameplay. Made its way on to my "favorites" shelf with a small handful of my large collection.

RATING: 3
This 3 stars is based on personal appeal and the fact that we are unlikely to play this one again.
The game looks great, and there are some really fantastic mechanism at work here. I really wanted to like this one.  After reading through the rules, we gave it a go and played for over an hour without finishing a round.  There are so many things going on,  it was very difficult to know what we were doing and had to continuously return to the rule book for clarification.  This is a pretty common occurrence the first time playing any game - but the rules are so layered here it would take considerable time to find the singular piece of information we had questions on. And many times the answer didn't make things easier to understand.
I did watch a couple how-to videos to try and better understand it, and we gave it another go.  Again, the individual elements of the game seem very promising and I really wanted to like it.  But even with the better understanding of gameplay, it seemed disjointed. Almost like the game was missing something, but the thought of adding anything else to this is a little crazy.
It may be that the game is just beyond our comfort level of complexity, but I am disappointed in this one.  I'm glad we were able to test drive it without buying.

A good game.  Not 'great' like I was expecting from the hype, but solid none-the-less.
An utter bear to teach, once the game gets going it settles down into a fairly intuitive sequence of play that, with all the shuffling of colourful wooden pieces, resembles nothing so much as algebra on an insane abacus.  
At the end of the day however, with its lack of direct conflict, Terra Mystica is perhaps a little too bloodless and anaemic for what I look for in a civ style game.

This is a great gamer's game, although the first game became rather bogged down with AP. My favorite games are the brain burners, but even I found this to be quite demanding. This will definitely improve with future plays, though, since will be able to focus on strategy and not the complex ruleset. Unlike several other recent titles (Lords of Waterdeep and Tzolkin), the game definitely lives up to the hype. I only refrained from purchasing this at Origins for $80 because heavy Eurogames that do not support 2 players well do not get much play in my house, and CABS has a copy. I am very much looking forward to playing it again, though.

This game is very good, and after setup there's no luck element, which I particularly like.

The race balance question is an interesting one- I think they're very close to balanced for top-end play, but if you're a new player, some races are much much easier to grasp their optimal (or close to optimal) build paths, so the bottom-to-mid end of play doesn't evidence the balance well.

  At first glance, the power mechanic and shovels mechanic are interesting, but once you see them in action, they are much less so (the bowls essentially means each power gain is really 1/3 of a power a gain, and you should burn off half your power ASAP, no question.  In-game, the digging mechanic usually means you're only looking at terrain that's within 1 of your type).  And the game is just a touch long.

However, despite these gripes, it's still very good overall, and I would definitely play again.

Preliminary score after one play. Elegant design both in gameplay and components... Lacks player interaction. By turn 5 our 2 player intro game seemed like a foregone conclusion. More plays with more players required.

It is heavy and very deep but has an internal logic and visual clarity which makes it easy to learn. Found it quite easy to teach to my wife, despite her initial scepticism. 

Update: second play was with 3 players. Still very solid and enjoyable but player interaction still lacking. I've read discussions that say that the game becomes more competitive at 4-5 players. For now, still an 8.

This game has been quite an evolution for me.  Initially, the components just really turned me off and I had zero interest in it.  I ended up playing a game and was happy to find out that it almost has a bit of a Settlers of Catan feel in that you're building up colonies on a map, something I've been missing in games.  Overall though it felt a bit dry and overly thinky to me to really enjoy.

Fast forward several months as I ended up with the game in a trade and started playing multiple games in a row, it has begun to blossom.  There are definitely some thinky moments where you get stuck crunching numbers, not any worse than Power Grid though.  What I really enjoy is the friendly competition for space on the  map, I love that sort of interaction where you're trying to outguess your opponents and beat them to the punch, or forcing them into positions where they have to help you out.  The multitude of races are really great also, maybe a bit restrictive some of them, but I love the variability of being able to try different strategies.

A deep game, each race plays entirely different. However, I would not want to play this with AP prone players.

After my second play I was not sure I ever want to play again as it felt like a lot of work and no fun. It was so unforgiving that depending on which race you go with the tiniest mistake kills you and is impossible or at least hard to play well on intuition. I want a logical, intuitively playable and fun game, this is the opposite.

However, after my third play this game shines. Now the rules seemed intuitive and I felt like my game was going well all the time. It also seemed like everyone else at the table were doing fine as our scores all ended within ~95-110. There were some differences now, everyone seemed to play at least semiefficently with at least some clear goals trying to use their racial advantage.

This is in the heavy category and it is very nasty if you make a mistake that puts you out of the game. But it is not as bad as the first plays indicated. In fact once you get the hang of it this may very well be the second best game ever, as it is now ranked.

Amazing game!
Read the rules, was obsessed with it, got one of the first copies, play it as often as possible.

[+] No randomness! replayability is huge, gameplay very different with 2p, 3p or more, where the racing aspect starts being intense (race for favor tiles, cult spots, key hexes, even towns come in short supplies with 5p); asymetric play, such a well balanced game!
[-] it's a long game with 4/5, lot's of rules to take in, don't like the rule about being allowed to terraform away from your home terrain, doesn't make any thematic sense! houseruled against it.

From the box and title, looks like an overly dry euro, but it isn't.  Instead, this is satisfying civ-building in 2.5 hours, reminiscent of a combination of [gameid=554] and [gameid=9216].  There's enough competitive interaction so that you're not playing in a vacuum.  The races are different in a great way, enough that they play very differently but aren't imbalanced.  TM also has that tightness that good euros have, where you want to do everything but have to pick and choose.  One of the most inspiring euros I have played in a long time.

There's a lot to like here, gorgeous components again, lots of different routes to play. The ton of different races and special abilities is always appreciated as well. My only complaint is that they're linked to player colours, I'd prefer if I could have my blue pieces and still play the dwarfs or halflings.

Terra Mystica is a heavy game, figuratively and quite literally, there are lots of pieces in this thing. It's strategically deep, but it doesn't feel fiddly, which is great, and the learning curve is not as steep as one might think, when playing with one of the "easier" races. Should be tons of replay value with all of the different races as well. Essentially a zero luck game, so it can be punishing if you aren't efficient with your actions and don't think ahead. This one is aptly described as "elegant" I think. I very much enjoy it. Also the player boards are some of the best designed I think I've ever seen, basically all of the information you need to play the game is on the boards.

This is a big, heavy Euro game, full of mechanics. It's really not that fun, unless you like really long games with no need to interact with anyone you are playing the game with.

This game is decidedly longer than the 30 minutes per player guideline printed on the box. Also it takes up a TON of table space. Bit of a learning curve but not as much as Agricola or Race for the Galaxy. It kind of felt like it was Puerto Rico, Settlers, Agricola, Small World maybe even 7 wonders all put together. What does that mean? It was pretty darn good! Lots going on and you can't neglect any one part of your game or you will quickly fall behind during the final reckoning. 

Lots of fun, keeps you very engaged but prepare to spend more time than you think.

It may have been the hype, but while I had a good time playing the game, there was nothing about it that really drew me in. I didn't have any of those "if only I had done this" or "next time I need to try that" moments afterwards. Heck, the games I've rated best I have dreams about.

There is definitely a solid game in there, but it felt like an advanced Kingdom Builder to me and the theme didn't connect at all, just like that game.

It's really great game, but not my theme. 
It's one of thoose games, which when I play I know that first it was some mechanics, and then someone created all theme for it, just in this case it doesn't work in my opinion. So as a game it should be 8.

RATING: 10
+.5 until I get more plays in to solidify a 10. Almost everything about this game is my jam. The mechanics are tightly interwoven, every turn you have a lot of viable options, your engine doesn't take the whole game to implement, and it has a great ebb and flow when taking actions. In fact, timing your actions is at the heart of a good, winning strategy and will change each game due to the random set-up. 

 The art is colorful in it's own way and the theme is not necessarily STRONG, but the trappings of the game all work together nicely so that the gameplay isn't entirely divorced from the theme. And PLAYER RACES! So good and distinct! Each new race you play as is almost like a different game! The length of between 2.5 and 3.5 hours is right in my sweet spot for a single game as well. 

My only complaint that comes to mind is that the cultist/gods track being a separate board tends to mean that half the table struggles to see what's going on there in the bigger player counts. No (good) solution really comes to mind though. If I get up to 5 plays and still love it this much, that'll be an easy 10 from me.

Update: I have played it over 10 times now with the app and on Tabletop Simulator. It's been great every time unless you get a VERY AP player. Still love it. Rating of 10 it is. Even got to try the expansion and new map.

This isn't a difficult game, by any means; it just has a lot of stuff to remember and track.  Add in variable powers for each race, which break the standard rules of the game, and it creates a mish-mash of details, which in turn create a lot of options.  It certainly feels like a deep game, but it's really just an optimization game of getting your engine going faster than everyone else, based on how you can earn points over the course of the game.  That's not a bad thing (it's not an openly hostile game; you really only interfere with other players through the limited actions on the board and where you place your pieces), but I have to admit, I was expecting something a lot more intense and unforgiving.  That's not a bad thing -- it's a good game, and I enjoyed the experience -- but I have to admit I expected something a little different.

RATING: 9
I'm not entirely sure how I rate Terra Mystica. I know I like it and that every play feels very satisfying, but there are some things that hold me back from truly loving it. For starters, it is really abstract. There is no true storyline to the game, you are simply racing to either build the most structures or send the most people to the temples. There's no reason for it, so I have a hard time getting invested in its story.

Looking past its lack of plot, there are a lot of neat things going on. The player mats are brilliantly designed and make record keeping a breeze, not to mention they act as a solid reference to help players plan their turns. The magic system is very interesting too, rewarding you for interacting with your opponents, even though VP-wise it is clearly in your best interest to stay isolated. It's an interesting tactical puzzle and certainly makes the game feel stronger than the sum of its parts. I gut check rate it as an 8. I like it, but don't really love the theme. The tactical puzzle is first rate though, not to mention that mechanically, it is better designed than most of the other games I rate an 8...so I think I'm going to bump it up a notch, even though I am not in love with the setting. It's just too well designed not to give it a little extra love.

UPDATE: With the help of my group, which has taken a real shine to it, we have gotten into this one deep. There are so many variables that come into play depending on what factions are in any particular game and which rewards come out and in what order that it feels almost impossible to master, yet our scores improve every game. This means it is a game of skill, in which consistency can be gained, yet relying on patterns is almost useless. I'm sold, bumping it up to 9.

RATING: 6
This is a tough game to rate. It's very well designed and I can understand why it's so highly ranked.

I had commented while playing it that it sort of reminded me of Warcraft III. My friends played that and Command and Conquer for RTS games, and I would only play C&C because of the resource system. C&C had money and electricity as "currency", if you will - Warcraft added wood to that, which meant I always ended up balancing them incorrectly and being short in 1 of the 3.

In this game, there are 4 currencies to manage, plus your unique abilities to consider, plus the unique abilities of as many as 4 opponents (one thing of which I'm fairly certain is that I'd like this more with fewer people). Given that human beings can only hold 7 things in working memory at a time, I suspect that this is a game that rewards memorization. My play of this was with people who all had a small handful of games under their belts, and still the winner (the mermaid player) won in large part because none of us realized what she was doing until it was too late to do anything about it. It seems like it would take lots of plays to get to that point, but that's when the "real" game would begin.

I'm not a lifestyle gamer. That's not to say that I don't enjoy exploring game spaces over repeated plays, but I don't want to dedicate lots of time to any single game. This is one reason Terra Mystica isn't for me - it's the kind of game that really rewards study.

At least, I think so. I also have some concerns about whether it will even hold up to the "lifestyle" play type it seems to demand. I have balance concerns, I have semi-solvability concerns - it seems very possible that this will be one of those games in which "serious" players only play these 5 races, and start in these positions, and essentially the game is decided by the random bits. Among all the glowing reviews, I'm already seeing little signs of this - people commenting that the games are feeling the same, that the most important decision is which race to play, and so on.

I suppose the most damning thing I can say about it is that I just didn't have very much fun. I've certainly played worse, but while I left the game thinking about what I could've done differently - usually something I consider a positive sign for a game - I simultaneously felt no desire to ever actually try again. I commented to my wife afterwards that I think I finally understand how she feels about most of the games I play - there was too much going on and keeping track of it all just felt like work.

My 6 rating might be too high, but I suppose I would give this another chance with fewer people to see if my first impressions are wrong. If you like playing a small number of games many times more than "dabbling", and don't mind having a ton of stuff to keep track of all at once, this is probably a great game for you (but perhaps not over time). For me, this competes with Container for the title of best game I don't particularly like.

This is currently my number 1 most favoured game. I couldn't care less about potential balance issues between races - whatever - it's completely irrelevant. This is a cohesive amalgam of exceptional mechanisms that form an astonishing and amazing dynamic.

For me TM is a brilliant game.

It is a perfect mixture of known and new game elements.
 
New, or at least not known to me:
The balance between advantages and disadvantages of  neighbourhood.
The bowls of power.  Mechanism works imho like an accumulator. You can collect the ability to boost one of your turns here until you can use it with best results.
Terraforming with variable costs depending on source and target terrain type.

Already known from a lot of games I like too:
Complex resource management.
"Too many" options who can select from for your single move.
Different races or fractions with some individual attributes.

Can't wait for the next session.

There are general strategies that must be learned and associated with the various races, as well as which races work with which set of bonus cards.

But after that balancing the general strategy of your race with round scoring, bonus card scoring and available resources is delicious.

I imagine the game requires bidding for races to be properly balanced, but I am not experienced enough yet to attempt it. Also, I am not convinced that the three bowls of magic and, to a lesser extent, the culling of magic add all that much to the game.

iOS version: 

Great strategy game. I like the asymmetry of the different factions and how your decisions can directly give bonuses to your opponents. I haven't played the physical board game but I can see that being better than the iOS version because it's hard to remember all of the things at the same time (cost for something, current cult track, what's available, etc) as you have to switch screens a lot to see everything vs just seeing it on the board. Plus I hear the components are nice and solid. 

Only downside is the playtime. It's a lot of constantly counting and looking forward for what you need to do (which I love) but I can see this being a 2-3 hour game every time and if it's not played regularly a constant rules correction on how things work regarding conversions, power, priests, etc. So since I love to play different games a lot and can only play a couple long games per month, I'll probably never buy the full game.

I played [url=https://terra.snellman.net/]30 or so online games against AI players[/url]. The game is a fun optimization puzzle. The most important currency is power points, which you can use to buy special abilities or any other type of currency (priest, worker, money, shovel, cult). You spend resources to shape land and build structures. I like how each race is unique, but I wish the overall game felt more thematic and cohesive. The building tree is really cool.

After one 4p game it seems like a bunch of mechanics glued together that require fixing by adding some more mechanics. Lacks "elegance". But I understand the love this game receives, it probably gets better with more plays. There's a lot to be learnt here, so I'll gladly give this one another shot in the near future.

After one play, I have decided to trade this game away.  I can see how the game is good, although I do admit I am surprised that it is currently ranked #2 on the top 100 here on BGG.  But to me, it just felt like so many other Euro games that I have played.  And as my tastes change, I am learning that these types of games just aren't my favorite.

Terra Mystica is certainly an incredibly deep and strategic game...unfortunately it is also a very intricate, ponderous and mentally taxing one. There is so much to keep track of and so many moving parts that I found the big picture tends to get lost amidst the nuances.

While I would never call it a "bad" game (it clearly boasts expertly-crafted design), I didn't find the experience terribly fun. It was more of an exercise in mental gymnastics than an conduit for good times.

In short, I was hoping for more mysticism and less mathematics from a game called "Terra Mystica".

[EDIT] after my second play, basically the problems of the game are still there. it is not slow, but it is long and complicated. on the other hand, it works well and it is kinda rewarding. i really have mixed feelings about this. raised the rating by 0.2
------------
TM is a well structured game that gave me bad gaming experience. Fundamentally, it is over complicated, terribly slow and not very original.
Components are good and you have a tons of them. Rules are never ending and there are too many details to remember. There is too much micromanagement to take care of but, most of all, downtimes are too boring. Somehow it is strange there can be these long time of waiting (talking about a 4 players game) since each turn you got to do something several times:nonetheless, it happens: you just have to wait.
Interaction is not very pronounced but to me this is not a bad thing per se.
The game is well balanced, there are multiple ways to reach victory, you have to take into account a lot of things and all this saves TM from a really bad game, but i don't feel the need to play it again.

Terraforming a hexed landscape in a battle for area control using randomly shaped wooden blocks* is Terra Mystica.

Its manufactured theme is a faux fantasy skin and some sloppily executed iconography lends greater confusion to an already convoluted system. Players suffer experiencing an abundance of face-up bonuses & powers which are a challenge to interpret, memorise and manipulate.

*These 'blobs' were compared by one of my friends to building blocks of duplo dropped on a non-descript kingdom.

A game state of this type will appeal greatly to any solution-driven player in your group, for moves can be planned ahead (or be blocked by opponents). If this game was simplified, given cleaner signage and textured with themes that fit the grain then it could become more enjoyable to play and teach.

One of the highlights for me was planning tactics interchangeably before each new round to gain bonuses. Unlike in Puerto Rico the player replaces his/her card counter when selecting a new tactic.

Aside from the average size board, player boards, card counters, wood blocks & meeples (no cards, no dice) I see no additional content to justify the hefty £60-65 asking price set to buy Terra Mystica. It might promise indefinite replayability yet for the same money I could recommend investing in a pairing of better designed releases that offer the same longevity and production quality with a sense of clarity.

This is not a game that I thought I'd like as much as I do, but here it is rated a 9/10. There's something about each and every race being slightly different and the desire to be close to other players, but not too close. Works at most player counts, but I'd prefer having 3 or more.

This game is sick. It's a struggle to learn, but once you understand the rules, it's on. A highly strategic game with no unfair randomness (what little randomness there is affects all players equally, no frustrating lack of hits or resources due to unlucky dice rolls). The mild randomness is in the setup making the winning strategy different every game. Combine with relatively short game times gives this game huge replay value. The $80 price tag is steep, but was worth it in my opinion.

RATING: 8
Only logged one play so initial impressions only but I like this game a lot.  I love that there are no free rides in this game.  Every action you take you are deciding NOT to do something else.  Do I make a play for expansion, building upgrades, spend my power, or pass to get that bonus token I really want next round so I can upgrade my water travel or excavation...  This game is very complex but a lot of fun.  

There is a bit of deadtime between turns which you can use to plan your strategy and adjust as the other players moves change your strategy but if you pass too soon, you could be in for a 15 - 20 minute wait.  

Also, some of the races feel unballanced.  Some only have a bonus that applies in the very first round (IE, getting to start with three dwellings) and others give you points for every action (like a victory point for every excavation).  Not sure yet if it's my skill level with the game or not.

There is no luck beside the initial setup, after that it is all about the player skill to get the maximum out of his race and blocking their opponents. The races are not equal, but they all can win depending of the initial setup and if you auction them it make it even more fair (the most stupid thing people can do is randomly choose the races).

Good quality game.  Lots of interesting actions and things to do.  I like the variety of the income mechanics: the presence of different buildings on the board yields different benefits (workers, money, power, priests, etc), but when you upgrade a building you lose one part of the income stream to get a different part of the income stream.

Beautiful in all of it's complexity. Have to get more plays through though to really write up a more detailed review.

With the number of factions and the number of times we're likely to play this, I think it will be a game of who can figure out most quickly how to play the faction they're given (or that they draft).  There's a puzzle aspect to it that I found fun in the first play, and I like the spatial element on the board.  The building conversions are an interesting set of choices both because of the constraints on the number of buildings and the fact that up-grading one building removes another; so you're trading benefits, not just moving up.  Excellent design in terms of how the game presents the information on the game state.  There are a lot of knobs to turn, which seems overwhelming as the first play starts, but midway through the first game everything starts to make sense mechanically and the flow of resources and ways to get victory points gets clearer.  And, in our game at least, the factions seemed surprisingly thematic for this kind of Euro.

My second favourite game of Essen 2012. It's a meaty and intricate territory building game with many paths to choose from and decisions to make, backed up by a varied selection of starting factions and special powers which should give it high replayability. At first, the choices are almost overwhelming, so it's good that there's a bonus to aim for each round which helps you decide what to build or upgrade.

The concern for some people might be that there's not enough interactivity between players. You're racing to terraform the best spaces and competing on the temple tracks and for certain bonus tiles but you can't directly attack others' positions. It's very Euro, but that's good for me: I like Euros.

Sold out at Essen so I ordered a copy when I returned home.

RATING: 10
The theme feels pasted on, but if you can get past that this game is phenomenal.  I love all of the depth to strategy that there is.  If you don't plan ahead, you will fall behind.  This game rewards you for thinking 2-3 turns ahead and punishes you if you don't.  I love that there are no dice, they have taken out the randomness that plagues so many other games.

Well crafted game, extremely fun to play in a group of 4-5.

I need to play this more to properly rank it.

For now, it feels like a good game but I'm not sure if it should be the #2 game on BGG. IMHO Puerto Rico is a better Euro, and I also think that the different factions in TM are probably the greatest reason why it became so well rated.

I was not convinced about the theme either. As far as I'm concerned this game could be about robots, dinosaurs or whatever you may want cause the mechanics are not linked with the theme at all.

Theme/Art:
The theme is great and immersive with the landscape shifting, every factions looks and plays unique. However, I'm not a big fan of the art style, but that may just be my taste.

Production quality/Design: 
No miniatures, but none needed since it's a eurogame. High quality wooden meeples and token, as well as a big board and cardboard pieces. Everything feels and plays high quality. No cards.
The design is amazing, ones you know how to play you can see what everything does with only one look due to very simple symbols.

Replayability:
The base game comes with 14 different races, each with its own abilities, so there is a ton of replayability. Also every game is different, because the bonuses for each of the 6 rounds are different everytime.

Depth/Difficulty:
It takes quite a while to explain to a new player (~1 hour) and you have to think of a ton of things during the game and plan ahead. I wouldn't say that the game is difficult, the mechanics are very easy to understand and also make sense, but there are many many mechanics and many options each turn.
I weight it 4/5.


Strategy:
Strategy is everything here. There is no combat, so you can plan ahead comfortably (as long as other players don't build in your way). Also every race has to be played with different strategies.

Luck:
There is next to no luck in this game. The only random factor are the round bonus tiles, which are determined at the start of the game, so you can plan ahead.
And you have to hope others don't destroy your plans by building on a tile you wanted.

If the players know the game it takes about 30 minutes per player, but it can easily take longer. Terra Mystica takes about 30 minutes to teach to new players.

Amazing game with insane replayability.

Terra Mystica comes highly recommended by many people. 
It looks like something we will enjoy too! I just played it with the Fire & Ice expansion with a fellow BGG gamer - cowhollow (Dion) from USA and 3 other guys at a friend's place yesterday 15 Nov 2014. Dion taught me Terra Mystica and it has a fairly steep learning curve due to the many areas and things to take note & plan when making our moves. Be sure you have set aside one afternoon for it as one game could easily take a about 3 hours or more for 5 players. 

Dion is a great teacher and I understand clearly how to play the game. I got 84 for my first game which was really beyond my expectation. The other guys and they were experienced Terra Mystica players and they scored 101, 96, 94 and 52 VP. I would love to intro TM to hubby.

Great game. Nothing feels tacked on, everything has a purpose. The way things interrelate with each other is very unique and gratifying. The power bowl system is also amazing. Variable races, bonus cards, and round scoring objectives give this one a LOT of life. It's almost a completely non-random game, only the initial scoring/bonus tiles are random. The cult board was also cool and ended up giving a nice amount of points. You definitely can't ignore it or the favor tiles granted through the religious buildings.

This is an amazing game that I'd never turn down a chance to play... which is surprising because I'm horrible at it. I've never played a game that has seamlessly combined so many different mechanics. Each round is a struggle to figure out what will work best for you and determine what your opponents are trying to accomplish and (hopefully) slow them down. Mix in that everyone is using a different race and you all have different abilities and that's when your mind explodes.

There is quite a bit going on in the game and,because of the variability from game to game, you really need to know the race that you're playing and the ones that you're playing against in order to compete. Because each race plays so differently you have to understand how best to play them as you're guaranteed to fail if you don't play to their strengths. You also need to know what the other people can/want to do in order to hinder them. The game also has the strange dichotomy in that you're competing against each other yet you want to be close to them to gain benefits from the, but at the same time, you don't want to be to dependent on them to the point where you box yourself in.

All in all though, there's no way that I can give this game the justice it deserves here without creating a massive wall of text. There is so much depth and strategy in this game and so much variability. I've played it a number of times now and I don't even think that I've begun to scratch the surface. Add to that the Fire & Ice expansion that makes a few improvements to the game (variable player order) and I think the game is deserving of its BGG rating. Amazing brain-burner of a game.

太過複雜：不同種族有不同能力、機制繁雜有太多小細節、回合動作種類繁多等。

不同的種族能力有可能造成遊戲不平衡，地圖的設計對不同的種族間是否公平也有很大的存疑。沒什麼互動感和策略，每場遊戲，每個種族就照固定步驟進行就好，無聊。

玩起來就像是其他外國玩家的評論：像一張試算表(spreadsheet)。
就是一個多元一次方程式的線性規劃問題，用電腦跑就好，有點枯燥。

看起來很複雜，其實沒什麼變化性，每場遊戲都照重複步驟進行即可得到不錯的分數！無腦的遊戲，不知道排名為何衝這麼高？頗瞎。

主題也無法融入遊戲中，完全感受不出魔法迷幻氛圍，比較像"房屋連連看"的遊戲。和魔幻有關的只是種族的人物和法力，但是這兩項也可輕易的抽換成一般的人和能力屬性，看不出獨特性和專一性。

米寶和美術設計也不吸引我，不喜歡這款遊戲。

2-5 players. Still my favorite game. I love the playing material and the income mechanism. The interaction with others through trade houses and power points is elegant. I don't get to play as often as I'd like though because it can happen that somebody who messes up in a turn and has few actions he can do has to sit and wait for 20-30 minutes while the others finish that round. Since then my husband won't play anymore.

I have increased my rating of this game due to the added features of the expansion.  The new board is more balanced and the passing board, new end game goal tiles, and especially the bidding of races for victory points makes the game far more variable and balanced.  Excellent game!
Original thoughts: This is an incredibly engaging, deep, and impressive game.  The game isn't as hard to understand as a lot of people make it out to be.  The steps and actions are fairly intuitive so I feel like the game isn't as heavy as people make it out to be.  I absolutely love this game because every race plays differently and the strategic decision making is intense and satisfying. I like how you get a bonus every round and choosing when to pass is incredibly important depending on what bonus you want or need for the next round.  The risk/reward aspect is nicely implemented.  You can build next to your opponents to get nice rewards but they may claim the valuable land that you need in later turns, and sometimes completely block you out of an area.  However, developing your civilizations away from your opponents is incredibly costly.  The last interesting aspect of the game that I would note is the manipulation of the power bowls.  This is one of my favorite parts of the game.  Not being able to move power to the third bowl until the first is empty forces players to be wise with their decision making process of when to spend their power to obtain a one time bonus.  These bonuses are first come, first served and only reset in the following round, so it is a race to spend off your power before your opponent gets the power bonus you need.  I would rank the game even higher if the races were better balanced.  This is one of the best that I have ever played.

Terra Mystica is a deep, and heavy eurogame, and the gameplay is good. Sadly I think it's one of those games that you must play a lot to actually make sing. It is hard to pull it off the shelf once a year, and try to relearn, and remember how to play each Faction. It's still a well designed game, and something I would enjoy exploring in depth, but probably won't.

Uwe knows how to write rules, they are fantastically laid out, and in perfect order for both learning, teaching, and referencing - just great! The intricate gameplay comes through from just reading the rules, but is better still in play.

My tastes in euros is changing though, and for now this will drop to a 7.

One of my all time favorites. It's deep, but not excessive. I've been playing for years and still learning something new each time I play. There are many different races, so it's almost impossible to keep them balanced. Also, starting color orientation makes a huge difference, so you can sometimes be screwed from the start a la Settlers of Catan.

I loved this! I know it often gets a bad rap at 2p, and I can certainly see how it would be better with more... Perhaps I was just wowed by seeing the game in action for the first time. I don't think I would buy it as we're not likely to play it with a higher count any time soon and there are so many heavier games designed for 2p or that work better at the play count. I would love the chance to play this with more people though.
Edit: I couldn't stop thinking about this so I buckled and bought it. Second playthrough (with dummies on 3 and 5 on the cult tracks) made me love it even more. Brilliant game.

I find playing Terra Mystica interesting. At first I found a lack of tension to the game... and I still do as there are stretches of the game where you are simply doing your plan on your own regardless of what your opponents are up to but I find the interactions more and more important as I play the game and strive for higher scores.  Still, its not as consistently tense or interactive as my very favorite games so all in all I'm not wowed by Terra Mystica... but I do enjoy playing it all the same.

Want to play again, not with the introductory rules.  The races *seem* imbalanced in the introductory version, so I want to confirm that they're not.

To me, it's a longer, more complex Hansa Teutonica.  Maybe my opinion will change after the second play.

So, so good, Terra Mystica is probably my favorite Eurogame. I thoroughly enjoy just about every aspect of this game. The pieces are great, the board is well laid out and simple, and the player boards are nifty. I really enjoy the mechanics, and also think the theme isn't so much pasted on as some people do. Overall, an excellent package.

This game feels like Eclipse to me without the dice rolling.  Complaints that some factions are superior to others probably have some merit, but I believe many of these to be inflated as match-ups among factions can be critical in some games because of the terraforming dial.

Fun to play.  Engaging.  A definite winner.

After dozens of online plays and 13 live plays, I can say that the "good v. bad" faction issues have merit.  Four of the factions are basically irrelevant unless you assign random factions as no one would ever choose to play Giants, Cultists, Auren, or Fakirs given the alternative of playing the opposite color side.  Blue and Black have fairly well balanced options and while it appears to me that dwarves are mildly superior to engineers in gray, I could see playing engineers in some instances.

This is not to say that the game is made any less by these issues.  It's still a wonderful strategy game, but a second edition with some tweaked faction powers for the underpowered options would be very welcome.

Possess the new town tiles now.  They add a dimension to the game and offer improvements to a few of the harder to play factions.  Definitely worth the five bucks out of the geek store.

I started off really liking this game. There is a good challange in finding the right way to victory with all the different races. The material and the board is very appealing. And far from last - there is very little that people actually dislike from the start (for exaple I would never get my wife to play a SciFi themed game, no matter how good it might be).
However, I hardly play the game any more - and don´t know anybody who does. And by now, I think it is for the lack of emotion. I don´t really feel enthusiastic when I decide for a move - or even win/loose the game. It is more or less a feeling like: "oh, well, good job, it did pay off, I guess". O.K., I might have optimized my potential, BUT there is neither the biting competition, nor the great satisfaction of having created something special, nor the feeling of having prevailed against all odds, nor much interaction with the other players...

Extremely awesome game. This is fast becoming my new favorite game of all time. The gameplay is deep enough to really make you think but streamlined enough to where you don't feel lost in the mechanics. I absolutely love the asymmetry of this game as it allows for balancing between experienced players and new players as well as providing 14 different factions each with a unique strategy. That's 14 different strategies to learn even without taking into account the other changes in setup each game.

This game has everything I love about games: tons of replayability, lots and lots of strategy, just the right amount of interaction and an overall extremely fun game every time it hits the table (not to mention an appropriate level of brain burning too).

I'm not a huge fan of this game. Maybe because I really suck at it. I do not want to make a blanket statement about variable powers in a game, but I think it does this game a disservice. I feel like the variable abilities are not well balanced as could be between all the factions. Also, I find myself losing track of scoring and resource gaining because it changes from round to round and it is different for each player. That said, I still want to play this game some more, because it feels like I'm just missing some defining strategy when I play it. In other words, I don't want to play it because I enjoy it, I want to play it because I hate not understanding a game.

I heard great things about this game so decided to pick it up.  The rules weren't too bad to learn and the multiple different races to play, combined with the randomness of scoring tiles, makes for a huge amount of variety.

However, the first time we played, the game went quickly and we were left wondering what was so great about it.  The second time we played there was a bit of an "aha!" moment when we noticed we should be streamlining our play to better maximize points and we got a better grip on power use.  The third game took a long time as we agonized over every turn to try to figure out the best way to play.

I am usually big on theme (ie. do I feel like I am playing a game or building a halfing empire) and the theme is fine for this game.  However, I find myself lost in maximizing the game mechanics to the point that I don't really notice the theme.  Normally, that would be a strike against the game, but in this game it is wilful ignorance on my part due to the depth and I don't mind forgetting the theme while playing.

This game comes with quality components and, despite my above comments, a great theme.

This is a deep and heavy game that I highly recommend for experienced gamers.  As per the above, due to the depth of this game, you need to play it a few times to really appreciate just how good it is.

This is one of my favorite games. The only issue might be having it get to the table, though my friends love it as well so not too difficult. I love the different races and how they play based on the order and availability of the round tiles and bonus tiles. I feel like this game really shines with 4-5 players, as 2-3 players people can get isolated and there isn't as much of a rush for actions. Great game, great mechanics.

I don't know when or how it happened, but the more I play board games the more I like Euros. Something about their consistency really rubs me the right way. Terra Mystica, with its variable starting points and widely diverse factions, manages to fuse the randomness I crave with the strategic stability I'm starting to really appreciate - especially in competitive games.

Superb Euro game. Next to zero randomness, but numerous races and other things to keep it fresh. Some excellent mechanics keep the game interesting, and despite it initially seeming complex, it's actually deceptively  simple. I've even introduced non-gamers to it - and they loved it too!

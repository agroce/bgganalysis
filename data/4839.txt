Lesson learned in my first game: Attacking hurts (the attacker)! As the WP player, forget about attacking those dug in enemy units altogether - even those shabby police units have a lot of staying power if placed in urban hexes - just try to sneak by on the Ubahn to capture the key locations.
All those column (penalty) shifts feel a bit overdone, still I'd like to try this again soon.
The map art may be a bit busy, also the colours for Urban and Suburban hexes are hard to differentiate, nonetheless fantastic work by Simonsen and definitely one of the factors that drew me to the game.

I've enjoyed two plays of this title.  The first as detailed in my AAR posted here was a NATO win, and a learning experience as the WP.  The second play was a WP blowout cease fire on turn 4 and surrender on turn 5.  I need to work on my NATO strategy, but I'm not when if ever this game will make it into the crowded rotation again for me to give it a third chance.

I do like the game for what it is, but (a) I can't see playing it FtF and (b) I'd have to be in the right mood to explore NATO at start placement strategy.

Played this game alot in 1983-1984.  What's not to love about the 20th Guards Army demolishing Berlin?  I am not sure if I still have all of the pieces.  I cannot recall any of the mechanics though, but I remember it had a good collateral damages rule.

Great game with lots of replay potential, a different setting for the Soviet juggernaut against the NATO lightweight.  Can't imagine how the healthy young Germans would have infiltrated in sufficient numbers - getting to Berlin was a paperwork nightmare in the 80s.

RATING: N/A
Looks very cool. The map simply has to been seen first hand to be believed. There are ugly maps, and there are ugly maps. This map elevates sheer, gritty ugliness to the point of becoming a genuine work of art, coming full circle to become a thing of beauty. In other words, I like it! 

The rules are simple and straight forward, even for a magazine game. This is one of the simplest rulesets I've seen for a S&T game, apart from Yarmuk. I haven't tried the game yet. 

TRADED.

678- one of the best Cold War simulations AND one of the best James Dunnigan & Redmond Simonsen collaborations IMHO.  This game could be a tutorial for modern cityfighting. As head of NATO, how long can you survive before you are crushed? Played solitaire, it's a wonderful puzzle to try again & again.

OK game.  Some unusual mechanics and chrome, but nothing overly complicated.  Play can bog down at times, but overall it plays pretty fast.  Despite the fact that I really like the theme, the more I play the less I like this game. As the NATO player it's all about managing ZOCs.  As the Warsaw Pact player it's all about maximizing CRT columns through air and artillery allocation. Irrespective of side, it's not about maneuver or combat which is why I play wargames.  Probably realistic interpretation of what could have happened in Berlin

Very Good: WWIII - Operational - Easy

This a great accessible game that breaths the cold war ear of the mid eightees; not only theme but it is an accessible old School S&T game.

I'm a sucker for old School games and if they are about a potential WWIII conflict I'm in.
When the expectations are high though it is difficult for a game to deliver but Berlin '85 does in all respects.

S&T 79.  I remember a game in which I was getting my butt kicked by the NATO player, but won the game as the Russian player by rolling a '6' (Berlin Surrenders) on some political events table.  Forever after, when my friend wanted to make a point he'd look at me and say "Berlin '85!".  Ah, what fond memories...
Played pre-BGG.

     If your enemy is in urban terrain you will not kill him unless you can suround him.  Or if he/she is in a POL hex then you can tourch him..  Actualy I use the map to play GEV/Ogre on since they are on the same scale.

When I was in Berlin in 1990, the Cold War and Berlin Wall were just over.  But I could still see a lot of the stuff dividing the City, e.g. the remnants of the Wall, the Soviet military fur hat, and the most famous of all, the three-language warning board "Attention!  You are leaving American sector"...

NATO is doomed, but how long can they hold out?  The system works well, the game is full of dire tension, and the components (& map) are ugly.  I never read the rules (being taught by another player) so I can't really comment on how complex they are or - come to think of it - whether we were even playing correctly, but it was good fun nevertheless. I'd try it again, but wouldn't seek it out.

Not only an interesting WWIII era game, but a very good simulation of fighting in a major modern city.  It does take a play or two to get a handle on the urban terrain and the ZOC rules, which are crucial to the success of both sides.  Would have been interesting to have had counters and a variant for a relief force.

Nice map, nice idea. I didn't play it because of the somewhat fiddly artillery rules. You have to declare all of your artillery before actually rolling the dice - and there are no markers for doing just that. Book keeping or a solid memory.

Great update of the Modern Battles system.  Very tactical for an operational level game.  Russians will win but NATO can bleed them.  If the Russkies use the optional poison gas rule, NATO can forget it.  And I think in  a real war in the 1980's they would have.  Thank God it's all speculation.

RATING: 8
An excellent game using SPI's standard combat system. Here the twist is that the map is an extensive urban environment tailor-made for defence. The other twist is that the defenders are vastly outnumbered and it's really a matter of time before the city falls. Rather than a game of pushing front lines to and fro things quickly become chaotic. The city sucks in Warsaw Pact divisions and chews them up. Play of Berlin '85 generates strong narratives.  There's a real feeling of desperation on both sides that makes for a novel and tense experience. I particularly like the 'They Shall Not Pass' rule which has made for some marvellous stories of last ditch stands. Overall, this game is something of a minor classic.

1) The Untried concept is silly for a number of NATO units, there is only 1 of several types; hardly unknown.
2) Due to the discontinuous front, it become a big problem being certain of which hexes are 'Friendly' for Supply line tracing.
3) The large number of EX results, which are essentially unavoidable in the city terrain, really damages WP more than NATO.
4) The large movement factors and widely varying MP costs as well as the ZOC rules (not helped by subtle color differences between Suburban/Urban hexes) and the porous U-bahn make for detailed planning and therefore, slow turns.
5) Long artillery ranges and FPF also slow the game significantly.
6) For night turns, are Roads etc considered 'Terrain' and therefore suffer 2x MP costs? (No)
7) Must the Soviet 34th Artillery Division units all be set up within 6 hexes of ALL other 34th units (not just ANY other 34th unit)? (Yes)
8) Rule 5.18 doesn't make sense; how are Police units forced into ZOC any different that non-Police units being forced into ZOC? The only thing I could think of was that Police units are eliminated if they are EVER in a ZOC (through Retreats and enemy Advance after combat, or just poor placement). (My opponent refused to accept this possibility.)
9) The Honors of War table is too risky to use. Even at the highest column there is slightly less than a 50% chance of a NATO Surrender. The 20VP cost of failure is just too high to even make the attempt. (This is just another Jim Dunnigan 'sucker' rules module.) The table would get a lot more use and the game would be more interesting if the VP cost was deleted.
10) Calling this a 16 turn game is absurd. With NATO bombarding the Railroad for at least 4 turns (maybe more), the game must be over in 8 turns for the WP to have any chance of Victory.
11) Leading me to believe this is more of a solitaire than a 2-player game.

Solitaire 7, 2-player 5 = 6 Average

While Berlin '85 never seemed to catch on with the public, I felt it was an intriguing and elegant game for an ugly and brutal battle. The key is, the Warsaw Pact forces WILL roll over the NATO forces. The question was, how long would it take? Could NATO hold out long enough for a cease fire/treaty result? It works well as a solitaire game.

Wow. Superb. Pure Gold from JFD/RAS. Bags of atmosphere and very absorbing. The US get tough going in the suburbs. 

I think the Warsaw Pact wouldn't have stopped at using chemical warfare, but where and when to use it is a fascinating choice. 

A great gaming experience.

A very interesting little game.  The map is rather busy, but once you are clear on what everything is, it gets easier it "see".  The number of counters is low, and keeps the game from bogging down.  It also has some good variable victory conditions that give the game lots of replay value.

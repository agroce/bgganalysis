Enjoyable game that I can see getting in regular rotation with my wife. The bidding adds a nice twist and palpable tension to tile-laying. Nice!

RATING: 8.5
Really solid medium Euro. 5 minutes to explain, 1 hour to play. Lots of interesting decisions and a great amount of game-to-game variety. The shifting economy takes a game or two to get used to and adds another layer of interest. It's probably not going to blow any socks off but it's definitely a keeper.

This game is really a blast, and the scoring mechanisms that shift from game to game (and round to round) make this game feel super fresh every play. My wife and I really dislike auction mechanisms in games but we find that setting the price for tiles, while somewhat auction-y, doesn't bother us a bit.

A good simple bidding and tile placement game.  I find the buying and/or keeping tiles bit a little fiddly, but probably just need more plays to get it smooth.

Awesome carton quality (French version). Not much air in the box.
Scoring tiles while abstract (i.e going for geometry shapes) make each play rather different. Also game itself is very fast! Setup time is minimal.

4 plays / 2,4,5 players

LIKE: Interesting auction decisions, pricing high to keep people from getting tiles you want. Interesting scoring patterns for each round, and it builds each round. Allows players to think and plan ahead. Plays quick.
DISLIKE: A light game, not much tension.Some scoring tile icons don't make sense and difficult to discern.  A little fiddly when placing tiles. Tile draw is random, so a player can be stuck with sub-optimum tiles.

OVERALL: Fun little game. I like pricing tiles. The game is better with more players, but not quite enough tension to be a great game. Nonetheless, it's ok for a beer & pretzels night.

**SOLD. A game that I would play, but not own.

Good game.  I don't think it replaces Carcassonne as my light tile-laying game of choice, but I'd definitely like to play this again.

With that said, I would always pick this over Carcassonne with 4+ players.

RATING: 6.5
I found this one just passable. I like the bidding mechanic quite a bit. The tile scoring range is fetching and I like the way it changes while the game progresses. I compare it somehow to Alhambra. And in these comparisons, I'm not wanting it in my collection - it isn't quite as smart nor as easy. And it isn't as interesting as other games in my thinking.

RATING: 7
Isle of Skye certainly delivers chances to make decisions every turn. I liked the game mechanic how players have to price their offering (in blind). I also liked the dynamics of the market with the amount of money in circulation changing. This helps with keeping the pricing decisions interesting through the course of the game. And Isle of Skye feeds the hunger of tile laying fans, like me.

Why not give a higher rating than a "seven" then? Well, the biggest shortcoming is with the information overflow players are exposed to. If one player really wants to analyse the situation, there is a tad too much information available for anyone to go through all possible permutations and find out the needs of other players in a reasonable amount of time. And there isn't really an efficient way to narrow the option space either, so you basically just have to assume the brute force approach. Given the limited capacity of human brain, this reaquires more time than what is the sweetspot for a family game. Moreover, the information is scattered all over the table, so there will be a lot of craning your neck. One might also complain how the game really does not feel like being in Scotland. You could basically name the game by any given mass of land and the experience would be exactly the same. However, the aforementioned problems are not big enough to ruin the game.

In nutshell, if you love tile laying you can't go wrong with this, unless you detest (blind) bidding or have gaming buddies notorious for their Analysis Paralysis.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

Isle of Skye feels like a more interesting version of Carcasonne, but not a whole lot more.  The auction mechanism is unique, but I'm not convinced it works very well.  It felt like a player could get picked on, even unintentionally, by having all of their tiles bought out from under them.  This is especially a problem for the first player in the round.  Yes, they wind up with a lot of money, but no tiles.  The next round they could price their tiles very high to ensure they keep them, but then they lose all that money and are back to square one.  In the one game I have played, the winning player had very few tiles bought off him, while the last place player had lots of tiles bought off her, and this seemed a very large factor in the outcome of the game.

Beyond the auction mechanic, the tile placing is somewhat interesting as you have to take into account what the scoring for the current round is, but also factor in the scoring types for the remaining rounds.  In the end, though, you're primarily just trying to find the spot that scores you the most points now, which is less interesting.

The auction decision is more interesting but can be highly speculative because of the tile that each player returns to the bag.  You can try to guess which tile your opponents will return, but this is somewhat of a crapshoot.

The game could be a source of analysis paralysis, and my one play felt like it overstayed its welcome because of the time it takes players to think out their auction prices, then to choose which tile to buy, then to choose where to place it.  All of this made a game that only really has 45 minutes worth of depth take more than an hour to play.  It has fewer decisions than other similar-weight games, but those decisions have more variables and thus feel more random than something like a 7 Wonders or Roll for the Galaxy, which are two games that have a similar weight level.

In the end, I found this game not unpleasant, but nothing too exciting, either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rather boring. To many uncertain variables that don't translate into any interesting choices. 

If you wish to play a tile placement game with an economic twist try Vikings because it's much better. Or just play Carcassonne because it has a much more engaging interaction.

From Secret Santa 2016. 

An updated take on [i]Carcassonne[/i] tile laying with an interesting bidding mechanic.  With the randomized scoring markers it feels more strategic, but it also feels short enough that luck-of-the-draw seems to play more of a role than what I'd normally like. It would be interesting to try a variant where there were 2-3 rounds before the scoring rounds began, or possibly a non-scoring round in between some of the other rounds to provide more time to really build up the clan territory.

"[b]Carcassonne[/b] with auctions" is probably the easiest way to describe it, but this description is missing some of the best parts.  The "auctions" are non-traditional, innovative, and barely fit this category...easily the best part of the game.  The variable scoring conditions is very Vaccarino-like.  The game is just the right length, too.  Nice job all around!

Not good at 2 players.

Definitely a neat game, although the random draw can suck when your tiles are the ones no one wants to buy for multiple rounds in a row, and you get starved for cash.  Doesn't seem to be a common occurrence, just a rough edge case.  Even with that, all players were reasonably competetive (scores ranged from 40 to 60)

Second play reinforced scoring strategies and how to plan ahead, but I still have no clue how to price things appropriately, so that you can get 2 tiles a turn (one bought and one not-bought from you).  Scoring seems to be not intuitive, as a couple players were completely non-competitive this time in a 5-player game (10 and 23 versus winning score of 60).

Wouldn't need to own it right now, but that could change with more plays.  Also, would gladly play again.

Tile laying with variable point setup. So much in the box to change up the game. Sure, it's still tile laying with set/symbol collection...but with all the point tokens that are changed game to game, it give a different feel each time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another recent hit that just utterly fails to do it for me.

The auction mechanic, while providing interesting choices and putting a different spin on your ordinary tile-laying game, isn't the whole game.  Price too low, you get money but not points (tiles).  Price too high, you get tiles (hopefully points) but not money.  Get a bad tile draw and you're just screwed.

What's wrong with that picture?  Well, the first two are your own fault (and your group's meta) but the last is just a kick in the teeth.  Bad tile draws - tiles that no one actually wants - are a deathknell.  You can't price them high since no one will buy them and you'll be out money on bad tiles.  You can price them low but then either they're bought and you have little to show for it or you get them and they don't actually help you.  The catch-up mechanism would work except people will pay more money to those with good tiles so they get more points (meaning those with good tiles also have a big pile of coins).  And then you're still in the back, with more money, and without any point gain to show for it.

I guess my biggest gripe, besides tile draw being very controlling, is that there tends to be positive reinforcement at work since the same goals are repeatedly scored.  It's not as if that guy with 5 boats is going to mystically lose 3 before the next scoring, allowing you to catch up.  Once you're far enough behind on a goal, you're behind and *VERY* unlikely to be in contention for it.  EVER.  So the money catch-up mechanism doesn't actually close the gap - it feels more like (unhelpful) pity.

I'd like to play this one more and see if my instincts here are wrong.  I kinda hope they are, but I fear they're not.  What am I missing with this "hit" that others see?  Or am I just a super not-fan of (some) auction games?  I don't know.

Dissapointing. I was expecting more from an Kennerspiel winner game. It's quitte ugly, totally themeless and mechanics are not interesting enough to make it good. Castles of Mad King Ludwig has some similar mechanics but is much better gameplay and theme is stronger.

RATING: 7
1st play: Carcassonne meets Key Market. I quite liked it.  The rules could have been a little clearer but not too bad, and I like games where you price items for sale. Neat mechanic I'd like to see more often and the art is well done. I think this is a great "next step".

2nd play: I liked it better the 2nd time, because I had a grasp of what a "completed" feature was.  We played the catch-up-coins wrong but the game has an excellent "market" mechanic, as I mentioned before, and beats out Key-Harvest.  Unfortunately it's one step too complicated for gateway gamers.

It is a good game, seems like Carcassonne, but every player creates your own map, the interaction is with the bid system and the choices the players put into the bid. I enjoyed this different approach, but I prefer when players interact in the same map.

Simply amazing. My wife and I love this game! Early in my third play(her 2nd)of this game, I became aware of how important all of the moving parts of the game are. The bidding, first player to buy, tile placement, victory point conditions, and end of game victory points work together to make it one of the best games I've ever played. Throwing out a tile and bidding on the other two seems so simple, but the strategy it creates is deep and fun. We'll be bringing this to our table again and again!

I love the game.  I wish the auction aspect had a bit more kick or twist or something to it, but the more I play this game, the more I appreciate about it.  It's one of the few games where you can screw someone over big time, but they can't stay mad at you because there is no point. The game moves on.  I like that a lot.

It is also one of the only tile-laying games I can even stand.  The fact that the other mechanics in the game can compensate for the most boring mechanic ever developed says a lot.

A deeper version of Carcassonne, with a few mechanics that (strangely enough) remind me of Reiner Knizia's Merchants of Amsterdam. And it's got Clan MacLeod in it: what more could a person want?

Legespiel über 6 Runden mit jede Runde anderen Wertungen. Mechanismus: Man zieht jede Runde 3 Plättchen, muss eines davon in den Beutel zurücklegen. Die beiden anderen muss man mit Geldbeträgen versehen. Reihum darf man dann 1 Plättchen eines anderen Spielers kaufen, der das an dem Plättchen angelegte Geld und den Kaufpreis in seinen Geldvorrat bekommt. Plättchen, die man gekauft hat, und solche, die nicht weggekauft worden sind (daran anliegendes Geld kommt in die Bank) muss man einbauen in sein eigenes Clangebiet. Da sind einige Entscheidungen gefragt: Welches Plättchen will ich abgeben, wieviel Geld lege ich jeweils an die beiden anderen Plättchen, was kann/will ich kaufen mit dem Ziel, sowohl die Einkommensehrung nicht zu vernachlässigen, als auch möglichst gut bei den Wertungen zu liegen. Scheint interessant zu sein.

Very similar in style to Carcasonne. Elegant mechanics and varying victory conditions. Only downside is that "bidding" for tiles doesn't make it as suitable for 2 players as Carcasonne
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As others have commented, there is nothing very original about Isle of Skye.  The tile placement is pretty similar to Carcassonne's; you'll be extending roads and trying to enclose areas in much the same way.  The tile auctions where the drawer sets the price and then pays it themself if there are no buyers remind me of Key Harvest.  Nonetheless, these elements fit together with variable bonus scoring from game to game to make an enjoyable game that is easy to explain and plays smoothly and quickly.

The artwork is quite pleasant.  Production quality is good.  The rules are clearly written.

An enjoyable tile laying and tile pricing game with a clever mechanic wherein players price tiles with their coins, which then, must be spent on the tiles if no one else purchases the tiles at the coin prices.  Then again, it seemed to me that I really did not want my tiles to be purchased since more often than not, I really liked them for myself.

I enjoyed the pricing mechanic and varying scoring mechanic, but in our four player game, I did not care for the repeated, and progressively more pronounced catch up mechanism in the game.  

I can assuredly see why the designers included the catch up mechanism, and perhaps in a two player game, it would not feel that significant, but in a four player game, a player in last place, perhaps 5 points behind the leaders, gets a huge windfall of money in the final round or two.  It felt strangely heavy handed and clunky, as if something was fundamentally wrong in the design. such that it needed such strong remedies.  

In particular, if a game design has a runaway leader problem, how do you fix it?  Change the design? Change the rules?  Change the way VP's are awarded?  Or have a very strong and repeated catch up mechanism every round?  Hmmmm....

Forget the comparisons to Carcassone, this is nothing like Carcassone.

This is a fairly simple, cut-throat tile collection game where the tiles form a tableau that can be used to score in different ways - which changes from one round to the next. It can be very hard to predict which tiles you'll end up with at the end of the buying round, so while there is definitely room for long-term goals, game play is more about rolling with the punches and making the best of whatever tiles fall your way. 

Playing competitively means carefully scrutinizing everybody else's tiles during each buying round, difficult from across the table and potentially AP-inducing.

Carcassonne: The Auction.
Silly I know but if you've played this game you might just agree with that assessment. Each round you get a hand of tiles. You must discard one and bid money for the rest. Then you reveal and try to get those tiles that you've put money towards. problem is players can always hold money back and buy those tiles out from under you. So you have to think about what tiles you want and try to reason out what tiles your opponents may want. Plan right and you can keep your tile, get one from an opponent and even make money for future rounds. The tile placement is same as you need to get certain tiles at certain because each round there is a scoring phase. And in future rounds you will score the same thing again and again. So it is critical to get what you need to score while either making your opponents pay through the nose for what they need or juts outright deny them that tile by discarding it. So it is a bit like Carcassonne but with an auctioning mechanism that we really enjoy (an exception to rule since we normally hate auction games).

A really neat tile-laying game that beats the tar out of raw Carcassonne for me because of that amazing bidding mechanic, in which you assign values or a discard token behind a player screen to tiles you've drawn, and then go around buying them off each other. Fantastic idea, almost brings in a 'master builder' feel since you can tell what combos other players might use and then nuke the tile syou don't want them to have. Gorgeous little game with some slightly involved scoring, and the scoring tokens will also vary from game to game, changing strategy.

Lovely - even if rather pasted on - theme. The bidding and scoring mechanics surprise me for how well they work. There's a lot of replayability in the game through the large number of scoring tiles, of which only four show up each game, giving rise to quite some variety in the strategies you need to employ.
The game is marred by a single aspect, which is that your own fortunes depend extremely strongly on the actions of the other players. The game has too few rounds to deal well with strong setbacks. Winning requires playing well, but you can still lose through no fault of your own, which can be frustrating.

This is a very good gateway/light-euro that has 3 prominent elements that come together in an interesting, polished, and fun way. (1) First, you have a tile-laying/abstract element (think carcassonne) that provides some brain-burn as players attempt to visualize how different tiles would look in their clan area. (2) Secondly, you have an interested waste/buy mechanic where players must waste one tile and set a price for the other two tiles. Pricing is tricky, as you are often attempting to protect your own tiles without wasting too much money. And what tile to waste is often a difficult decisions, as you don't want to create opportunities for your opponents (they may buy it from you). (3) Finally, the game has a very interesting end-of-round scoring. Essentially, 4-tiles are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game and they score 3x each but at different intervals. This makes a game that rewards tactical and strategic decisions. 

For competitive gamers, there seems to be 2 major criticisms. For one, the game has a strong catch-up mechanic. Secondly, I'm not convinced the valuing/auction mechanic reduces the randomness in tile-drawing. It certainly seems easier to protect tiles than to purchase the necessary tiles, as you can only purchase one and another opponent may steal it from you. But, the game has very simple rules, intuitive objectives, and decisions a bit like an onion... always another layer to think about. For a gateway game, there is a lot to like.

I confess that I don't understand the Carcassonne comparisons, for they are far removed from each other, other than the square titles you are matching sides with.

Carcassonne has points scored on a common board with unchanging rules, which are very simple except for the farmers. This probably the easiest of the three classic gateways (others being Ticket to Ride and Catan).

In Isle of Skye, there is no communal board and tiles are acquired with clever auction system. Points are scored according to variable center tiles and which round it is. This is very different and much more complicated than the former

Alapvetően Carcassonne-szerű lapkák, de itt rengeteg féle ikon fordul elő (többféle állat, csomó fajta épület), a leépítési szabályok az utaknál nem szigorúak, és mindenki külön birodalmat épít. A lapkák titkos beárazása ötletes, és a körök végi kiértékelések is nagyon feldobják, szuper ez a része szerintem, és a sokféle kiértékelési típus miatt nagyon változatos, sok játék lehet benne. Ami zavart, hogy  a kiegyenlítési mechanizmus kicsit sarkosan van megoldva... Meg az egész kicsit olyan lutris játék. Csináltam gyorsan az elején egy 10 pontos tavat, amire kaptam a játék folyamán 30 pontot... Ez a teljes pontszámom 40%-a volt, ezzel nem is kellett már foglalkoznom, a többi típussal meg szenvedtem és közel se tudtam ennyi pontot kiizzadni egyikből sem.

Przyjemna gra, w której każda rozgrywka może wyglądać inaczej. Losowo dociągane kafle mocno wpływają na sytuację, więc niektóre rundy mogą polegać bardziej na przeszkadzaniu, niż zdobywaniu punktów. W mniejszą liczbę osób będzie to gra nastawiona mocno na kontrolę przeciwnika, a w większą - bardziej chaotyczna, typowo imprezowa potyczka. Ze względu na całkiem istotną rolę pieniędzy na koniec gry, możliwy jest mały kingmaking poprzez kupowanie, na którym można zabrać lub podarować komuś kilka punktów.

Bought after a couple of friends recommended it, and after it was awarded the Kennerspiel des Jahres 2016 (over Pandemic Legacy!).

It is a tile-laying game where everyone builds his/her own tableau, with an interesting mechanic for the assignment of tiles: each turn, each players draws 3 tiles and secretely chooses one for discarding, while setting a price for the other two. Then each player can buy one tile from an opponent. The key is setting the right prices, to keep the best tiles while also maintaining a cash flow for subsequent rounds.

The idea of having a wide range of different scoring tiles to have a variety of flavors in different games is great. And the idea of scoring different bonuses at the end of each round is also great (for giving different incentives in different phases of the game).

Isle of Skye is one of those games where you can't find anything exactly new, but everything is so well put together and it flows so smoothly...

Pandemic Legacy is a great game, and I would've voted for it as KSdJ, because it was such a great experience playing it. But I can see why the jury chose Isle of Skye instead, and I must admit that it is a very very good game, in a more traditional way.
Pelican and Pfister are on fire, and I will definitely keep an eye on them!

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: After having played this game, I've come to the conclusion that tile-laying games just are not my thing. This game reminds me most of Carcassonnes, a game I was not particularly fond of. I seem to have problems seeing the patterns necessary to playing this game well. I did enjoy the other main mechanism, a "bidding" system involving setting prices for your tiles and allowing your opponents the opportunity to buy them from you. Too low and your opponents may end up with tiles that you wanted for a bargain. Too high and you will end up depleting your resources as you pay the price to the bank. Overall I enjoy this mechanism but will probably stick with Castles of Mad King Ludwig which includes a spacial aspect as opposed to a pattern recognition component. Still, I would like to play this game again if only to verify my ineptitude with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This one just clicks for me.  I love the price-setting/purchasing phase, and I love the puzzly elements of actually laying down your tiles.  While the actual tile-placing rules are very simple, the scoring tiles you have in that particular game means placing tiles can be VERY strategic.  I love that with the 16 tiles, you get a lot of replayability, and how the purchasing phase is an interesting sort of self-balancing system.  It just intrigues me and has a nice mix of mechanics that end up working very well together.  A more thoughtful game than Alhambra, and I have found it a pleasant mix of tension in purchasing phases with relaxing tile laying.  I liked the pacing!

RATING: 8
Plays fast with 4-5 players and each playthrough can be quite different from others based on the random scoring tiles and/or the players' pricing habits. It's also very accessible to non-gamers, so its rating gets bumped a little bit for achieving both accessibility and gamer-friendly-ness.

The mechanisms provide some advantage to player who are familiar with its strategy. For example, after a few plays you start getting a feel for how much a victory point is worth and you can start pricing the tiles efficiently. Despite the advantages over a newer player, the game's built-in catch up mechanism keeps everyone involved until the end.

This is a game that is easy to explain to non-gamers; though they may need a full playthrough before they fully understand some of the tile strategies.

Haven't managed to play this with 2 players, yet.

I'm always a fan of games that involve tile placement, and building your own thing. While it can be frustrating trying to figure out how to price your tiles in this game, I still had fun with that mechanism. The balancing act of pricing high enough that you're not giving things away, but not so high that you have to buy it yourself is enjoyable. I thought there were a few minor flaws, though. The first of which I was assured was pretty rare for this game, but in my one play the catch-up mechanism had a massive effect particularly in the last round and therefore felt overpowered. It just seems wrong that a player can literally be only a handful of points behind the leader and suddenly get a windfall of 9 coins. The other issue I had was that it seemed there was maybe one layer of complexity too many. There were certain elements that felt unnecessary. The last thing I struggled with was getting my Carcassonne-trained mind to see the land areas in this game and to eliminate the roads as a dividing line. Perhaps it was the choice of artwork in Isle of Skye, but I never have the problem of accidentally placing a field next to a city in Carc, but here it happened more than once. Yet, despite any nitpicks, it was an enjoyable experience and both my parents thought it was a game they might try again.

This rating might be a bit harsh and probably I suffer from some mild form of OCD, but I cannot stand those unfinished roads!

The game is probably a good example of how too much variability can lead to a game where you are not really sure any longer what you are doing at all, besides meeting some randomly drawn criteria. As a whole the game is just too disjointed for me, in particular I dislike how the game introduces different entities on its tiles as symbols, but simply uses all of them for points, just in different sets or combinations. That is a really boring way to do a point salad.

That being said, I am not sure what the main strategy for this game is; most of the gameplay feels random. It balances very poorly and the game is not as social as you might expect.

First time I played this game Aug/16, I knew how much I liked it after the second round of play.   It isn't a terribly long game, but that is to its benefit.   It is a bit of a mad scramble to gather points when ever you can in the limited number of rounds there are.    This feels like Carcasonne meets Keyflower.   

Drawing three tiles from the bag and making the decision that you want the tile sold, or wanting to keep the tile yourself is fantastic.   If you want to keep the tile because it is useful for you, you have to set it at a price that would not make it enticing to the purchasing player.   But the price you set it for, is also the price you have to pay for it.   Therefore setting it to high forces you to possibly overpay for it.  There is a simplistic complexity there that I find so intriguing. 

The scoring system in this game is also brilliant.  You draw four scoring tiles from the set of sixteen, and those four are randomly placed under A, B, C, D.   Examples of a scoring tile would be; One point for every farm animal, or five points for the most ships.    But each of the rounds played, scores a different tile, and in some cases, multiple tiles.   So planning things out is intriguing, as you can try to score points on every round, or try to build up for a big score on a given round.

This is a very satisfying light/medium, non-thematic strategy game that is very accessible to most gamers.

Carcassonne meets Kingdom Builder meets Key Harvest.  It's got the tile laying of Carc (with relaxed tile placement), the variable end game goals of Kingdom Builder and the setting a price/buying/selling of Key Harvest (albeit with money not goods).  

While I love the game, I much prefer it with 3 and 4.  With 2, it feels too balanced as each player usually ends up with 2 tiles and if one round, one player gets 3, the next round the other player almost always gets 3.  With 5 players, it's just hard to keep track of everything going on and it's easier to accidentally get screwed or helped.

After a bit of a bumpy first round the rest of the game was a delight. We never really got cutthroat enough to squeeze one another for money where later tiles were concerned, and the scoring conditions can seem a bit muddy, but there were definitely adorable cows and sheep.

Excellent medium weight game that has a definite Carcassonne feeling with the tile laying; a little Kingdom Builder with the several scoring cards; and a little Castles of Burgundy final bonus scoring - all games that I enjoy. But Isle of Skye has its own personality, with enough tweaks to give it its own place in the medium weight range for any collection. Tough choices every turn are faced with tile selection, and their values. After this phase has ended, careful thought again must be put into placement of tile(s) into your kingdom, to optimize scoring. Still, the game plays in just over an hour. Lovely tile illustrations add to the enjoyment.

RATING: 9.5
So good. Just outside of my top 10.

I love trying to figure out how to set the prices and the different scoring conditions make each game feel very different.

The one thing I don't like about the aesthetic is that the roads don't need to match. After so many plays of Carcassonne it's jarring to see the road end mid landscape.

I've heard a lot about this game and the buzz has been very positive. It's sat in my collection for awhile but has finally made it to the table, since then my group has played it several times. The game has a couple of neat things going on. It combines a tile laying game with a variant of an auction game. I compare this one pretty closely with Carcassonne, but the variable scoring mechanics really make this one stand out. This game will be sticking around in my game bag for awhile

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, simple, light-medium weight tile-laying game with blind auction mechanism to buy tiles, that can be surprisingly both tactical and strategic.
++ Highly variable game scoring depending on the 4 scoring cards drawn (out of 16) at the beginning of the game and also according to their order when drawn (A, B, C and D) as each round scores a combination of these cards differently. Also, some tiles have individual scoring opportunities.
++ Great replayability from the highly variable game scoring and the tiles draw order.
++ Easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Really good 2-players game, but a bit better at 3 players as this offer more choices without without lengthening the game too much.
-- Especially at higher player numbers, the auction phase and the buying phase can take a lot of time depending on the players (as these steps can be AP-prone). But this can be easily mitigated by the use of a sand timer that can be always kept in the box.
-- [-]I wished there could be an expansion to further expand the scoring tiles (there are some possibility that are not covered), and maybe even add some new twists to this game[/-] (It's coming in 2017!).

RATING: 9
A neat, light-ish game of placing tiles in order to best satisfy a selection of goals, which differ from game to game.

Each turn, every player gets 3 tiles, setting prices on 2 of them, and discarding the 3rd. Then in turn order, everyone gets the chance to buy a tile from another player at the set price. If, after everyone gets a turn, you have any tiles that didn't get bought, you must pay your set price to keep it for yourself. So, each turn, you'll get to place 0-3 tiles into your personal landscape.

Then players look at the scoring for the round. At the beginning of the game, 4 different score tiles are randomly chosen which dictate the scoring for the game, so you're goal will be to maximize the points you get in each category. Additionally not every scoring tile is scored every round, so you'll need to get the timing right as well to score the most points.

Overall, a very neat game with seemingly a lot of good replay value due to all the scoring tile possibilities, combined with what tiles are drawn by the players. Good stuff!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like that the tiles get offered to your opponents first but you set the price. If they don't buy the tiles you have to pay for it at the price you set. 

In Carcassonne you add tiles to a shared area, in IoS you are only adding to your own area. This means in IoS there is not much stealing your opponent's work (not a bad thing just a difference to Carcassonne).

It is annoying (because of OCD) that roads can abruptly end when matching terrain tiles.

Fun tile-laying game that every gamer and non-gamer will like. Each player builds his or her own little Scottish kingdom and at the end of each round gets points based on a set of randomly selected goals. I love variability in my games and this one does not disappoint between the random goals and the huge number of tiles available to draw. The game also adds a really neat little auction phase where you can buy one tile from another player. The game is easy to understand but has a number of touch decisions to make that will keep gamers interested. Definitely recommended!

This game killed Carcassonne.  Once I get Isle of Skye I am happy removing Carcassonne from my collection completely.  Not that I particularly enjoy Carc, but to take the elements I DO like about that game and then add a unique auction element, and variable scoring, then you have an AMAZING game, and I have no reason to ever get Carc out again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Price tiles such that you have money to buy a tile. Buy tiles based on the scoring. Place them in your kingdom. Repeat. If the game had come out twenty years ago, it would have been awesome. As it stands, it just isn't doing anything interesting. Heck, it feels like SimZoo (a 2002 game) with goals that change from game to game (but the goals don't really alter how one thinks while playing, it just makes some tiles more valuable than others).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and fast little game. Borrows Castle of Mad King Ludwig's "master builder" mechanic where you price tiles for other players to buy, with the improvement that everyone is does it simultaneously every turn so that there is less downtime. That alone is a big selling point, IMO.

The game moves at a crazy fast pace, so players are forced to choose when and how to score. The variable scoring criteria should keep things fresh (again, it worked in Ludwig!), but adding the timing element where certain objectives only score on certain rounds will really make for some nice variety. it's all very clean and straightforward, but with those tense juicy choice points.

That said, the transient scoring and fast playtime leave me with a weird dilemma: it's just hard to get emotionally invested in my island (and thus the game). There's DEFINITELY opportunity for long-term planning here (and someone who can exploit that AND be opportunistic will win), but it all feels a bit fleeting and then it's over. Still, I think I have room in my collection for a fun puzzle that winds up feeling a bit like a diversion.

The only thing I outright dislike about this game is the catch up mechanic where the player in last place gets more income. I don't even really care if it works or not, it just feels so contrived. Everyone I've explained the game to has rolled there eyes at it. It isn't something like Power Grid's turn order system - which you manipulate throughout the game taking the best and worst positions to smartly further your strategy, but just... "you're in last. have a cookie". I can deal with it, but man it reeks of inelegance in an otherwise very streamlined game.

I suspect this is best with 3 players. With two, I think the economic game loses something when there's a certainty that you'll get one of your own tiles every turn. With 4, much like Ludwig, it's extremely hard to keep track of who is doing what and thus price tiles appropriately. 

PS: I suggest using a house rule where you must take the piece you axe and taunt the player it would help the most with it as you toss it back into the bag. Improves the game tenfold.

Isle of Skye is essentially an abstract. The theme is totally irrelevant and there is some potential for analysis paralysis. However it provides lots of hard choices due to the variety of ways to score and replayability.

Tile laying game with an auction phase and scoring rounds. The game didn't grab me after my first play.

Great game, love the decisions in pricing your 3 tiles and having to balance your money to buy 1 tile as well. If you go late in the round you might be able to get more money from someone buying from you, but if you go first then you have less money but better tile selection. This feels unique to me and I love the tension it brings between all the players. The wide variety of scoring and building tiles are fantastic for replayability too and it will be hard to feel like I've played the same game twice. I'll be happy to play this whenever as even with 5 we played it in about an hour.

This is the tile-laying, area-building game for me. The tile auctioning mechanics are innovative, scoring of different elements each turn handled brilliantly, and theme charming. The title is lighter than its immediate peers, but the tactical follower placement is nicely replaced by the unique tile selection method.

Just a little annoying in that the box is so small - doesn't line up with the other Mayfair/lookout titles in my collection.

Pretty neat game. Like it much more than Carcassonne because everyone gets to evaluate worth of their tiles rather than just randomly getting good or bad ones. Extra coins for players behind also seems neat and can make waiting to score big at the end a more viable strategy. Agree that one negative is it can be difficult to see the symbols on the tiles across the table.

It has counter-intuitive mechanics that provide some fun.
The game becomes unstable (random) if some of the players doesn't understand the logic of correctly valuing the tiles.
It is a pity that every player has his own landscape board and there is no interaction.

Good for the randomizable parts that give replayability, but this and the money-catchup mechanism demonstrates the design is flawed from the beginning.

The Isle of Skye theme is totally pasted.

Would play again because it is light, you don't need to think a lot and some stages are intrinsically fun.

Really liked this game the first few plays, thinking it to be a replacement for Carcassonne (it is absolutely not).  This game is profoundly broken out of the box, with an almost guaranteed tendency to produce a runaway leader (essentially ruining the game every time!).  This can be remedied by randomly selecting 5-6 goal tiles and then removing the ones that are too similar to each other prior to starting the game.  The auction mechanic can be great fun, and is the heart of the game.  Most new gamers will like this game, but some experienced gamers will hate it with a passion.  Recommended for 3+ players.  The catch-up mechanic is a corny bandaid that in no way fixes the problems with this game. I knew that something was wrong when I could predict the game's winner after the first round!

First impression: Blech. What a luckfest. Played with five, it is: take what you get and make the best (or worst) out of it. And the tiebraking rule is quite harsh - three quys tied for first place? Each gets five points! Runnerup, who has one lousy thing less? Gets nothing! The game seems not to be for me, as I don't like SO MUCH RANDOMNESS in my games. Maybe I'll try it again with three or four players. Maybe not.

Disclaimer: I was having an exceedingly hard time keeping my eyes open during this game owing to illness-induced fatigue.

I seriously don't get the enthusiasm for this title. It's tile laying of course, and the roots of Carcassonne are clearly visible. The game gets kudo points for using changing scoring goals: always a nice mechanism for introducing variability in play. So far so good. But in six rounds you can't do a lot of build up, so that scoring, so attractive at first, becomes a bit ad hoc. Okay, I guess. And then there is that ridiculous auction... what's it doing here? I understand the questions you're meant to ask, but as with any game involving simultaneous hidden guesses (blind bids is appropriate to use in relation to this game) these questions must be [i]simple[/i]. They are not that in Isle of Skye (far too many variables ranging from your own tile world to that of opponents, plus scoring opportunities, plus cash situation, plus ...), and thus utterly and irreparably fail on a fundamental level. It's very difficult to steer things you want them to go, and so at the high end of the player count player chaos reigns supreme. 

It all leaves me scratching my head quite a lot. I think I'm going to have to conclude that after [i]years[/i] of Carcassonne-domination, people are just glad that it got a few new mechanisms to play with. I'm sorry, that's not going to cut it for this old grizzled gamer.

Like Castles of Mad King Ludwig, but where everyone gets to make I cut you choose auctions at the same time, and scoring is far simpler to keep track of. Like carcassonne, but the tile draw is mitigated by auctions. So better than both of them individually, and certainly better than the whole.

Simple, visually appealing, easily taught. The price/discard/pay mechanic at the center of tile selection is rather clever: Most of the time, you want another player to buy your tile, but you really wanna milk him/her for all its worth. Turn order is also important when pricing tiles. Plenty of VP goals and combinations keep the game fresh.

This game may have replaced Carcassonne for me.  I doubt I'll ever get rid of Carcassonne, it was one of my gateway games, and I've invested in with a lot of expansions.  But this one gives more purpose.  There are four random scoring objectives that'll trigger at various times throughout the game.  That give you a purpose in searching for various different tiles to add to your kingdom.  Some tiles also have additional bonus scoring that'll trigger at the end of the game - which doubles if you complete (enclose) the terrain on which the bonus scroll lies.  It's a quick game, rather light, but fun.  I can understand how it won the Kennerspiel de Jahres award.

Played this game with my gaming group.  They were not impressed with it.  But I still enjoy it, so there! :P

I'd heard this was a bit like Carcassonne, but a step beyond, and the description is accurate. There are two nice twists that make this game stand out.

First, you have a secret pricing system where players are setting a cost for their tiles. The key is to keep prices low enough when you want players to snatch them up, and high enough to scare them off when you don't. Secondly, there is a shifting in what's scored each round (which changes game to game), so timing is just as crucial as what you put down in front of you.

Anxious to try this again with various player counts - I think it has a lot of potential.

RATING: 10
Components: Sturdy tiles and drawstring bag. Functional coins in different sizes and colors for the different denominations. The artwork is great, with lots of fun little details that reward close examination. Even more satisfying than Carcassonne to see my tile landscape build up over the course of the game.

Experience: The economy in this game is really interesting. Managing my income; controlling who I pay money to; setting pricing; trying to defend a tile from purchase; axing a tile I don't want anyone to have. I've also noticed that if I raise the price on one of my tiles, it increases the value of my other tile, because in a 2-player game it's usually better to get any tile than no tile.

I love building my kingdom, trying to keep my road options open, and to adhere to the various scoring goals in play. Like Kingdom Builder, having different combinations of scoring goals makes each game feel distinct. With the addition of individual scoring goals on the tiles themselves (and the opportunity to double them), each player begins to value tiles differently.

The goals lend themselves to really different styles of play. Some emphasize the shape of my chiefdom, some emphasize how my tiles are connected by roads, some want me to have many small completed areas or a few large completed areas. The different permutations make for a fresh game each time.

Awesome game. Fast-moving.

Variant: Played one game where each player has a private, hidden scoring goal. That was fun too.

On reste dans le Spiel. Mais cette fois avec le "Spiel Expert". Bon, alors, (avis tout à fait personnel), je ne comprends pas trop comment ce jeu a eu le Spiel "expert" (En plus, face à un Pandemie Legacy et Time stories) car on est plutôt dans du jeu grand public. Isle of skye est un jeu qui fait un peu penser à Carcassonne (dans le sens où on va construire un plateau avec des tuiles paysages reliées par des routes ), mais chacun le sien. Au niveau du scoring, cela sera en fonction d'objectifs qui changent à chaque tour. Les tuiles vont s'obtenir par une forme d'enchère. Un jeu adapté à tout public, sauf aux gros joueurs de cubes qui aiment le contrôle le plus total sur leur stratégie (zut, c'est moi, ça :D). En tout cas, c'est un jeu qui plaît et qui s'apprend vite.

Pour 2 à 5 poseurs de tuiles (les allemands aiment la pose de tuiles!) pour des parties de 40 minutes environ

Ah, ou est passé le temps ou le Spiel expert/connaisseur était gagné par des Descendance, Caylus ou Agricola. Snif... (Avis tout à fait personnel aussi :) )

Reviewing this rating and bumping it up. The brilliance of this game isn't in the rules or the mechanisms but in the auction that happens. First, each player needs to set the price for two tiles and determine which one to remove from the game. Then, each player needs to determine if that price is fair and if they want to buy the tiles that are for sale. The whole player driven market makes the decisions involved deeper and richer than one would expect from the surface of a simple tile laying game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In my opinion Isle of Skye a perfect "next step" game after Carcassonne. The rules are simple and intuitive, but it offers some more difficult decisions and strategy that more seasoned gamers will love and appreciate. 

What I love about the game: It has some phases in each round in which players act simultaneously, which keeps down time relatively low. It has very high replayability with the randomized scoring objective tiles. It scales well, and it's a lot of fun! 

I can't think of anything negative to say about this game!

RATING: 8
Played this a couple of times and after being initially quite overwhelmed, I'm now really enjoying it.  The overwhelming part was trying to work out how to price your tiles.  Too low and your opponents will pinch them off you.  Too low and they'll leave them alone and you overspend.  But to know the value you've got to understand how useful your tile is to other people and those are quite complicated mental calculations.  But, I did do better in my second game so it's definitely possible to get the hang of this and improve.

There are a few elements of this game that add together to really appeal to my tastes. First, the tile-laying, which is one of my favorite mechanisms. Next, the scoring tiles. I love how the game is very different each time, with a changing focus on what is actually valuable each play. And, to a lesser degree, the price-setting. With the addition of the barrels, it feels more economical overall than Castles of Mad King Ludwig which uses a similar price-setting feature. Overall, there are several things coming together that make this game great for me. Highly recommend

Has any designer had a better year than Alex Pfister did in 2015?

Another exceptional game. If Pfister wrote a mystery novel someone would get shot in the first paragraph of page one. He doesn't ease into anything - all his games seem to start in the middle. I love that. And although they're surprisingly heavy games for their short length, Pfister seems to know that agonizing decisions don't induce AP when you're dying to see what will happen next. 

He just gets game design. If you like Isle of Skye, don't miss Oh My Goods! and Mombasa.

edit: With 5p it was hard to feel like you had much control. In the 2p game pricing your tiles is incredibly angsty. You want to price them just high enough that your opponent can't buy while keeping enough cash in hand to pick up one of theirs.  

With 5p someone would buy one, or often both of your tiles, no matter what prices you set. Players who got bought out last turn have enough cash to pay whatever price you can set. 

IoS is still better by far than most 5p games that clock in under an hour. But it is remarkable in many ways with 2 that are diminished with 5.

It kills time but there's no challenge, and it doesn't fill the role of filler or party game.

Boy did I get destroyed in this game.  Lapped.  But it was a pretty good game in the vein like Carcasonne.  You build your own city and score based on your tiles.  The good thing is that the game comes with a lot of variation on what needs to be scored (5 goals are used each game).  To get tiles to play, you pull 3 tiles, discard 1, and put a price on the other 2.  If no one buys them, you pay the price and buy them yourself.

Interesting tile laying game, where players are Scottish clans, expanding their land holdings, and trying to accumulate victory points.  The market mechanic where you put tiles up for sale is very interesting, and worked well here.  It created a nice, meaty tile laying game where you had to think a little, manage an economy, watch the scoring triggers.  Lots of variety in the game too with the different scoring tiles.  Very enjoyable, and another hit for Pfister.

The price setting (auction) portion of this interested me but with only 2 tiles  (1 of your 3 is trashed) of your own and a possible 1 from opponents it just did not feel right when we played.  Passing is not really a viable option as you are very likely to end up with only 1 tile - and in a 6 round game you just can't afford to have only 1 tile.   Also, I felt like things were just getting interesting right as the game ended.  Overall I really did not like it but do understand that those who enjoy price setting mechanism may love it.

Pleasant and approachable game with bright graphics and zero theme.  It has some Carcassonne elements but perhaps the best thing here are the scoring goals which vary every game in a Kingdom Builder type of fashion.   The pricing of tiles is very important but also very arbitrary and I found that a little frustrating.   But you need to get multiple tiles each turn, which requires setting prices high but not too high.   That part is a bit of a guessing game.   The rest flows pretty well and the game should be good have enough shelf life for a very reasonable $35 MSPR.

Isle of Skye is an advanced form of Carcasonne where you put a price on the tiles you randomly pick and try and sell them on to your fellow players, or price them out of the market so you can buy them yourself.  With scoring dependent on the type of tile you have, the value of the tiles will vary for each person dependent on what they are collecting.  It is clever but I think the simplicity of Carcassonne is preferable as both are ultimately tile-laying and scratch that same itch.

Sold on after a play.

Isle of Skye is my current favorite tile-laying game, by a pretty decent margin. It's simple to learn the rules and to play - but is surprisingly "think-y" for a light-weight game. It's what Carcassonne should have been. The combination of the auction, the varying objectives (different in each game), and tile-laying makes it feel fresh, even though it largely uses tried and true mechanics. It's a fast game (30 mins to an hour), with good player interaction. It's fun to play, satisfying to build your kingdom, and aesthetically pleasing, as well.

That said, the game isn't perfect. It's not always going to be a "balanced" game (there are 16 objective tiles, you draw four out at the beginning of the game, and they are scored at different times throughout the game depending on the order in which they were drawn). It's also one of those games in which you feel like you have more control than you actually do - a lot of doing well in the game is getting more tiles than the other players (not necessarily better ones), and there's only so much you can do to block your own tiles from being bought. 

All in all, a definite winner. Definitely recommended if you like the concept of Carcassonne, but not the execution of the game.

RATING: 4
2016-03-17 : This game is the answer to the question of how to put more gamer elements into Carcassonne. Instead of random tiles, the tiles are auctioned. Tile placement rules are relaxed, but if you can manage to place them perfectly you can score more points, more scoring opportunities are given etc. The problem is that at its heart it remains Carcassonne and I just happen to not particularly like tile placement / tile matching games. They all try to have cute art which hinders play - form over function - making it all but impossible to quickly scan your opponent's status. I waffled between giving this a 6 or a 4, but the lousy graphics (from a playability pov) and the catch-up mechanic that essentially destroys good play means it's going to be a 4.

RATING: 8
While certainly a tile laying game the meat of the experience isn't as much with that as it is with properly valuing tiles while strategizing for late game scoring (C and D as well as scrolls) while tactically doing as much as possible for early scoring. Certainly more depth here than Carcassonne but it doesn't replace it as Carcassonne is still best for newer players. Closest comparison would be to the game Vikings, which I also enjoy. Great game.

Carcassonne with tile auction. Nothing special to see here.

RATING: 9
This game is a cracking mash-up of Carcassonne and Castles of Mad King Ludwig. How so?

Carcassonne:

You are placing tiles with various scoring features next to other tiles in a way that the landscape matches (in most cases). Isle of Skye differs in that you don't have to place components on the tiles to score them and players are not placing tiles to a communal area. 

Castles of Mad King:

You use money to buy tiles. Beyond that, players need to be able to value the tiles for the round. Each player is also building their own little area. Isle of Skye differs in that each round all players set prices to tiles rather than a single player valuing all the tiles for the round. This usually leads to less downtime.

So, what else makes Isle of Skye a unique game? Well, each game you will randomly choose 4 scoring tiles out of a bunch that come with the game. Over the course of 6 rounds each of these tiles will be scored 3 times each. Even if you have the same 4 scoring tiles the game will play differently based their position on the round tracker. This game really appeals to me due to being less directly confrontational than Carcassonne, quicker than Castles of Mad King Ludwig, and extremely variable.

If you play with two, do use this variant:

RATING: 8
Despite being one of the most accessible games in my collection; Isle of Skye is chock-full of rich decisions. The balance of pricing your tiles while leaving your wallet plump enough to buy other tiles is fabulous, and the end-round scoring mechanism forces players to develop both short-term and long-term strategies. The catch-up mechanism seems too strong on it's face, but is quite fair in practice, even at the higher player counts. Isle of Skye is a game of assessment. Determining the value you place on each tile for yourself, and weighing that against the presumed value to your opponents is the heart of the game, and makes the game highly replayable since the valuation methods (scoring tiles) change not only round to round, but game to game as well.

This is good.  A tile-laying game w/ a twist.  Isle of the Skye hit's my wife's sweet spot with it's Carcassonne puzzle and tile-laying nature, but it also scratches my itch for a little chaos by giving me a chance to monkey with her plans via the blind bidding / auction mechanism used to acquire tiles.  She certainly can get a potty mouth while playing this one.  

Yes, I very much enjoy Isle of the Skye.

The best way to describe this is a far more in depth carcassonne.  What seems like a fair amount of randomness in the scoring actually has a good amount of strategy.  Managing your money and preparing for future scoring rounds takes a lot of tile study.  There can be a little bit of AP involved in this but generally the game moves quickly.  Not much setup or rule study either.  There is a little bit of screwing other players too which is nice.  Overall seems like a well thought out game.

The thrust of the game is figuring out how much of a price to demand of the tiles you offer each round. The catch is, you must put the price on your tiles with your own money (imagine someone putting a $100 bill on an item instead of a price tag). The money you put on the tiles is money you don't have available to purchase someone else's tile. You soon realize that your best bet is to price things so high that nobody buys them because then you get them yourself. 

Figuring out how much to place as a price to keep people from buying your tiles vs hold back as cash is one of the two ostensible fun points of the game. The other is taking the tiles you've won and placing them on your tableau to create whatever Carcassone-like requirement it is the turn demands of you. Carcassone on steroids is trite but rather apt. Personally, I don't find either compelling, especially for how long the turns take. 

The problem is the game is completely opaque. You don't know how much people can afford or not nor do you know if buying certain tiles will pay off down the road. Still, you spend several minutes locked in AP as you try to figure out the right bid for the right tile(s). Then you wait for your opponents to finish their computations. Then you do it again. In the end, you spent a lot of mental computation time over what amount to be guesses. The actual decisions aren't that interesting to me. It feels like some very heavy lifting for what is ultimately a rather light load.

tile laying strategic bidding game.  often compared to carcassonne but the heart of this game is really is on the auctioning strategy and not the tile laying.  each turn everyone has to put up their new tiles for sale and each player buys 1 tile. U can then buy any of your own unsold tiles.  So the key is about deciding how much to put your tiles up for sale for (similar to castles of mad king Ludwig except all players are doing this simultaneously which is far more fun)

This might be a nearly perfect design. Simple to teach, yet it has a lot of difficult decisions to make every round, not to mention the fact that each game plays so very differently based on the different scoring tiles that come out.

RATING: 7
Similar to Carcassonne in that they are both tile laying games, but this truly differentiates itself with the auction that allows players the opportunity to be more selective about which tiles they get every turn, and allows them to get multiple tiles per turn.  The game also ends in a set number of rounds, so it doesn't overstay its welcome at the table.

Played through this once at a meetup and really liked it, enough to grab it myself. It fits into that medium-weight game that I can get the non-boardgamers in my life to enjoy and it has enough depth for the hardcore gamers too. The auction mechanic is probably the hardest for non-gamers to wrap their heads around. It's a great game though.

Remains to be see if it will replace Carcassonne as it does add more depth through scoring variability and placement decisions but as a result contributes to more AP and playing time.

Have to play one more to decide. This game appears to have Runaway leader problems..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like the twist of the tile laying whereby you draw three, discard one and buy/sell the others, and I think it mitigates a lot of the luck of the draw that can cause a runaway leader problem in [thing=822][/thing], however there are a heck of a lot of things on these tiles, not only do you have three types of terrain you also have farms, cows, whisky, sheep, ships, lighthouses, and others, which all score in different ways, dependent upon the tiles you have previously drawn and the starting objectives. 

It is actually quite difficult to predict how in demand the tiles you just drew could be and thus difficult to set a price and this is the main meat of the game. I think more familiarisation with the game would lead to better pricing of tiles and thus allow the game to flow more, but our first place certainly felt very stop start and clunky.

I really do like the concept however and will be pushing for more games of this soon.

A solid semi-abstract full of fun decisions.  It has the similar combined mechanics of "GLEN MORE" (building a points engine), "ALHAMBRA" (purchasing tiles) and "LOWENHERZ" (a hidden bidding duel).  However, the details of the mechanics are still distinct enough for the game to feel completely unique.  If you liked any of the three games I mentioned, you should definitely buy this one.

Fantastic game that was easy to learn and teach. I've only played once but it's exactly the kind of game I was looking for - one that is quickly taught to new players, but offers a depth of gameplay and decision making that keeps veteran board gamers interested throughout the entire game.

I can see why this game plays best with two. Once more players are added, the number of decisions to be made during the buying phase of the game can really muddle the flow of the game. Even at two we experienced some analysis paralysis.

Szeretem a lapkalerakós játékokat, szeretem az én felezek-te választasz mechanikát, szóval mindenképp érdekelt ez a darab. Jó kis játék. Nagyszerű ötlet a saját pénzből kell árat szabni dolog, bár emiatt azért be is lehet ragadni, főleg az elején. Talán jobb lenne egy icipicivel több pénzzel indulni. Szuper jó, hogy minden játék más, köszönhetően a rengetegféle pontozásnak, nomeg a lapkák randomságának. Sajnos úgy érzem, hogy azért elég nagy előny jobb lapkákat húzni benne, hiszen azok drágábban mennek el így több pénzed lesz. Illetve kicsit küzd, minden ilyen osztogatós, árazós játék problémájával: négy játékosnál már nem igazán lehet lekövetni, hogy kinél mi van, és kinek mi mennyit érne. Senki se örülne, ha valaki elkezdené végignézni, hogy most akkor ki és hova tudja beépíteni az adott lapot, pedig igény lenne rá.

Jó kis játék.

Even though it is not an entirely new mechanism, the pricing of tiles is what differentiates Isle of Skye from most of its tile-laying brethren. Each turn players need to set prices for the tiles they draw, and the other players get first choice of a tile to buy. Tiles that do not get chosen have to be bought by the player who set the price.

In theory, this could lead to players setting prices individually according to current circumstances and special needs of certain players. That would probably significantly increase play time, however. In practice, many of the tiles are quite similar, and since there is a steady influx of money into the game, over time all tiles generally become more expensive with (relatively) minor differences depending on the scoring conditions in this particular game. And similarly, you typically don't want other players to buy your tiles at all because in many situations more tiles is better and you can acquire at most one per turn.

Carcassonne weiter gedacht. Der Smartie-Bietmechanismus und Klemens Franzens Optik fügen dem Lege-Klassiker etwas Neues hinzu. Schöne Standardkost mit Charme: 3 Plättchen aus Beutel ziehen, zwei zum Kauf anbieten, mit Glück selbst behalten, anlegen, Punkte kassieren. ISLE OF SKYE hat mich dennoch positiv überrascht wie eine Schachtel Pralinen vom Aldi als Mitbringsel. Aber den VKF von um die € 30,-- finde ich deftig. Ein guter Zwanziger würde es auch tun, meine Herren.

I've heard good things about Isle of Skye, so I was intrigued to play. Overall it has some great things going for it. Carcassonne-style tile laying is never an issue for me, so check!  And this uses the auction mechanic from 'Key Harvest' (whether intentional or not) where you set the price for your tiles with your money and either a player buys it from you (getting your money back to but losing the tile) or nobody buys it (and you gain the tile but lose the money).  I love that mechanic! Beyond that, I found the game a bit standard and not diverse enough to make it a true, innovative winner in my book. I appreciate the attempt to make the game variable with different scoring tiles, but I can't imagine the different scoring methods would really change the way the game is played all that much (as it all boils down to set collection and tile placement in the end, no matter the variables).  Also, I think the art is rather sub-standard, which is a real shame considering how signature Klemens Franz's work typically looks.  Also, this is another one of those games where you play best by analyzing everybody's shit thoroughly - and I don't exactly care for the time that takes.  And it does seem like a necessary part of the game to constantly scan everyone's tile-board and generalize how many points they can earn, etc.  Overall, a good game but probably one that will take a backseat as time goes on.

INITIAL IMPRESSION

What an excellent implementation of carcassonne like tile laying with a bit of castles of mad king master building and variable round scoring (forgot which game I saw this in before)

The game plays about 15 min a player and has a ton of replay-ability with the different scoring tiles and which tiles people draw/go for.

I think the only mindscrewy thing for me was that roads don't have to connect to be a legal placement and do not block terrain connections.

I give this game a bump for now but I could see it going to to a solid 8 after more plays

Decent game --one I'd compare to Castle of Mad King Ludwig, although the mechanism for bidding is better. However, it has the same problem, that turn order combined with poor play by one player, makes for king-making. It's perhaps more refined, but loses the thematic fun of castles. I'm told this is quite good at 2p, but only have played 4p.

TI rate 6 strictly for the 2 player game as that is what I've played, I expect it to get much better with more players and will revisit my rating then.I love the idea of this game, it has very simple rules but a lot of interesting, tense choices. I don't usually like tile placement games, but I think it helps that you can interfere with each other's boards and that you get the tiles you want (if you're willing to pay). I like the wide variability in scoring and that a tile could be amazing for one player and worthless for another, or amazing or worthless depending on the scoring tiles. It's fun setting the prices, keeping in mind that you need to be able to afford the other players' tiles with the money left over, but being able to push your luck and hope a player before you buys one of yours.

The game suffers at 2 players, though. As there's only 1 other player to buy from, there is plenty of opportunity to price-gouge them. It leads to a more cut-throat but less interesting pricing game.

Isle of Skye is an enjoyable, relatively fast game with two players. We picked up the rules quickly, except that we kept forgetting to award extra coins during the income phase to the player who is behind on VPs. That mechanism is important to prevent a run-away leader. We like exploring the strategies of the auction and of tile placement. We think that we will find plenty of replayability in the varying goals. We rate this game a solid 7, and could see this rating rise.

A nice cross between tile-placement and economic management; fans of Carcassonne who want something slightly more in-depth will enjoy this game. Plays quickly and not difficult to teach.

IoS is both a bit odd and a bit charming because of the dual nature of the game. The first part is the sales phase (auction is not quite right) and the second is the tile placement phase. While on the surface that seems like it wouldn't work or, at best, be disjointed, it's surprisingly smooth. I like how you've got a bit of player interaction in the sales and then a bit of navel-gazing in the tile placement. 

A couple of notes from a recent play:
-Everyone thought the game ended a round too soon. Several players mentioned that they would like one more round where all the bonuses scored.
-After playing at both 3 and 4 players, I think 3 is the ideal player count. With 4, it is too difficult to both consider your own strategy and get a sense of what other players need or guess what they will offer up.
-Still a bit confused by the scroll scoring. Need to read the rules more clearly on that.

This is still a game I would like to have in my collection but I don't absolutely need it.

This is a really good auction (?...Idk you set prices but there is no bidding) game. Feels good to lay your tiles and build your own little point scoring kingdom but the auction element means you're also keyed into what other people are doing. Very easy to play and teach. Good alternative to teaching someone pandemic or settlers of catan. Would probably still pick TTR as the gateway best for most situations though. 

Edit: After a bunch of plays I've realized I'm pretty bad at this game! As in, I've only ever won twice and both times I was teaching people who were completely new. You can get locked out of the game which is no fun, but for the most part, the frustration I've felt has really just made me want to play it more. And this last time I played was one of the closest and best times yet!

Edit: After playing the game literally 9 times, I found out I'd been playing and teaching it wrong (basically I hadn't known there was a 1 buy/turn limit. This makes pricing and way more important and prevents you from getting locked out of getting any tiles on the first round which was basically an auto loss). This change is fairly minor in terms of overall game quality, but does make it a bit smoother. That being said, 10 games in, still really bad, but still can't stop wondering how it'll go next time I play. Love it.

Like the variable setup. The wealth redistribution creates interesting balance. On my first play, trying to out-think opponents with bidding seemed entirely futile. For a simple rule set, there seemed to be a lot going on. It almost felt like it was over too quickly, but at least it doesn't overstay it's welcome. I'd like a few more plays to see if I can develop some real strategies.

This game is great! It has an interesting mix of mechanics that connect really well. Bidding/picking prices for the tiles adds tense choices and I particularly like the varied scoring mechanic, where at the start of the game you draw some scoring conditions and every sound you score one or more of them. It keeps the game fresh and cleverly avoids a dominant strategy.

RATING: 7
Tile drafting is a lot of fun, and the replay value in this game is very high with the variable scoring conditions. A game I can have fun at while losing: seeing your finished land is a small reward in and of itself. The game balances the Auctioning and Tile-laying aspects well, with both phases feeling well-integrated into the game.

At times it can seem a tad dull, but the heavy catchup mechanic tends to keep you in it. Everyone having the same goal leads to some frustrating moments of being cut-off or denied.

Tile-matching a la "Carcassonne", but with each player developing their own individual kingdom. The different scoring tiles that are randomly selected during setup provide some nice variety. It's a fine game, but I dislike the lack of control in the method of acquiring tiles. You set the prices for two of the three tiles you draw and discard the other, buy a tile from an opponent and then pay for your own unsold tiles. There is simply no way to guarantee you will get the tiles you need.

I don't like Carcassone but I do like bidding/auction games (Goa, Dune, Medici, etc.). Isle of Skye splits the difference and the latitude where roads are concerned, number of tiles/choices available, the 'catch up' mechanism and the price setting/auction round fit this game into my wheelhouse nicely.

The next step for "Carcassonne". It looks very familar and it even plays somewhat similar, but it's much more interesting than "Carcassonne". 

A player does not have only 1 tile, but 3 and you can choose from any player, which makes it way more. Putting up the tiles for sale adds some more tension to the game.

It's sill nothing I would buy, but this is a great small game that should sell very well within the next few years.

More I play it, more I like it. 

+ Pretty easy to explain, quick to play, hard to master (especially pricing tiles)
+ Love that different set of goals drastically changes the isles you build. 
+ Love scrolls that give you more options to score 
+ Screens off moment + axing + buying in order are priceless. Tension, fun :) 
+ Was not impressed with art, but I like it more and more... easy to see all important details across the table 
+ Well balanced... Pricing is more important than randomly drawn tiles. Even a draw of 3 less than perfect tiles does not need to be a setback [you can at least save lots of money or close the scroll areas]

Keeper! Solid family game, solid gamers' filler.

I played this at hunter&cron BerlinCon against one of the designers and one other player. It's a beautiful game which probably reminds one of Carcassonne as the first impression. Besides the tile-laying and world/island-building the main mechanics are: bidding for tiles every round and buying them from the other players; and the scoring phase which scores 1-3 of 4 different scoring criteria every round.

All in all my first play was okay to good. Of the 3 main mechanisms I like the anticipation of the different scorings best, I guess. I'm also (usually) a fan of bidding. The problem I had was that each round you basically have to evaluate 3 tiles per player (everyone draws 3 and you can bit on yours and plan to buy other player's tiles), which in our 3p game was 9 -- which can, at least for me, trigger analysis paralysis. Even if some tiles are an obvious "no-fit", you still have a handful to take into account. Given that, I guess 3 players is more than enough -- I fear that 5 players would take the game into unpleasant territory. 

I wouldn't buy it yet, but I'm eager to try out the other scoring tiles.

UPDATE: played a second time. Down-rating from 6.9 to 5.5 — Sorry, this just isn't my cup of tea. While I can see the good design and understand why people like it, I personally have almost zero fun playing it. For a family game the tile-evaluation/bidding phase is too AP-triggering for me. I could ponder 10 minutes over this, but then again I don't want to play this game for 2 hours. This time we were 4 players, which made it worse, as I expected it after my 3p game. Maybe I'd try it *once* again as a 2p game. But i's unlikely.

For me this in my very own Carcassonne. I don't own Carcassonne, but I have played it several times and it's really good game. In this one I see a lot of what makes Carcassonne so good. Tile-placing mechanic with a lot of bright colors and interesting historical theme. Similarities between these two games doesn't just end with tile-placing and theme, but there's still plenty of things to differentiate these two. Carcassonne, even with two players, is considerably longer of these two, where as Isle of Skye has some extra mechanics to consider, like auction mechanic. Carcassonne is more straightforward, in Isle of Skye there's more things going on. Both games are highly recommended if looking for a great tile-placing game. 
One negative thing about Isle of Skye is the box of the game: there's no inserts, no plastic bags, nothing to help you to keep your components in check and in good order. And just like in Carcassonne, there's a lot of components in this game.

RATING: 7.5
Isle of Skye is a smart mid-weight tile-laying game, which takes off from Carcassonne or Fjords, and adds some market valuation as well as some set-building mechanisms, which gives some of the flavour of Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  

Players draw income from whiskey distilleries linked to their castle by roads, then they select 3 tiles, and set pricing secretly for 2 while flagging the last for discard.

Price is set by placing one's own money on a tile- in effect, a firm offer to buy a tile.  This can be used to buy a tile (likely at a high price), or can be used to accumulate funds for other tiles. Each player gets a chance to buy one remaining tile from other players if desired, and if a tile is sold, the player gets their stake back as well as the asking price.

Players place tiles, and then, based on round, variable scoring tiles are scored for points- nice planned play variability.

At game end, each 5 money is translated to a point (Scottish thrift), and some tiles have bonus point banners which are scored at game end as well, which can double for being in a completed region.

By taking away the area control aspect thru player boards, this adds a self-building feel, as well as a level of control over how things lay out.

Players have some interaction thru the pricing mechanisms, and the ability to potentially buy away a desirable tile, if income and bank allows.

The variable turn scoring means that there are many ways to score, some competitive (most ships), and some independent (completed regions).

The artwork is lovely, the rules simple, and 6 rounds play quickly.

All in all, this is a tasty combination, and I have no hesitation in giving a strong initial rating, with a an expectation to likely increase over time with plays.

This is just a fun game, easy to play at many levels, and seems to invite one more round- a must-buy for me, and an excellent choice.

My favorite filler of the year! A quick simultaneous auction-pricing tile-laying game that works for two or more. Simple tile laying reminiscent of [thing=822][/thing], with scoring combos for each game that add a combinatorial explosion of replay value.

Yet, the secret simultaneous selection of one tile to discard, price two that you must buy if not sold to others, coupled with the option to buy from others, just makes for a fantastically interactive game, not experienced since the likes of [thing=34084][/thing] or [thing=172][/thing]. 

Might be higher if the scoring strategy shifts from round to round were more intuitive.

I bought this game because of its similarities to Suburbia and Carcassonne. I'd say it's a mash up of those games, which is what I love about it. It has the landscape-building of Carcassonne, the tile placement aspect of Suburbia in that certain tiles affect others, but it also has an auction element as well, which forces you to gauge how other players will react to the prices you set for your tiles. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a set up from Carcassonne.

Awesome, superior game!! Thinking man Carcassonne. Juego formidable. Lleva Carcassonne a su potencia ideal. Durante el juego vas a ir adquiriendo losetas de territorio para construir las tierras de tu clan. Pero lo fascinante es que cada round tiene un criterio de puntuación diferente. Al principio se seleccionan 6 tabletas de puntuación que van a determinar tus estrategias en la selección de las losetas y en la contrucción de la comarca. También hay un mecanismo de compra y venta de losetas integrado en la fase de subasta que hace que los jugadores se disputen las losetas que cada uno ha adquirido.

Scottish-clans-themed tile-laying/auction game. The scoring method changes make each game feel significantly different than than the previous. There is no box insert, so that could obviously use work, and the player shield components are less than stellar, but passable (the ones from Fresco were much better all-round).

Fantastic at 4 or 5 players (yet to try it at 2 or 3).

Yeah, it was alright. I can't help thinking that the auction bit and the tile-laying bit were sort of getting in each others way a bit, like two fat blokes trying to get through a door, but it was a reasonable amount of fun.

The shopkeeping/auction mechanic is very neat, I'd like to see more of that.

RATING: 5
This might just fall into the category of "not my thing". I enjoy it, but it's not something I would generally be really keen on playing.

Things I like:
- Victory conditions being random means that the values of different tiles vary wildly from game to game.
- The price setting and turn order makes for a fun rhythm to sync up your cash reserves to.

Things I don't like:
- The spatial element never really comes to the front, and there's no real way to control what tiles you are building towards, since tiles are fairly random.
- Victory conditions and tile draws can occasionally interact in weird ways. Lots of points available for brochs, but no brochs show up? Wonk wonk.
- The interaction between players is fun at three player, but it's hard to team up on someone who is in the lead when they pull bad tiles.
- In many cases, you want to have bad tiles in front of you so that your opponents don't buy them off you, giving you a lot more territory to play with. In other cases, drawing bad tiles can leave you cash starved when no one will buy your tiles. Both cases are not controllable.

Nitpicks:
- Setting prices is sweet and all, but it's pretty obvious which tiles you are putting money on, since people can see you stacking and moving things around behind your screen.
- Some victory conditions are super boring in two player games. Any of the 5 points to first, 2 to second, especially.

I've played 2x two player games, and 2x three player games. Two player seemed more interesting to me.

Really enjoy pulling this off the shelves - it is reasonably easy to teach to non-gamers, and is IMHO a logical step forward for the newer player from Carcassonnes.  The hate-buying/hate-pricing of tiles is great in late game, and there are many routes to victory in any given combination of scoring tiles and scrolls.

Juego muy ligero para terminar sesiones. Somos jefes de tribus escocesas que quieren expandir su reino. Durante seis rondas vamos a ir colocando unas losetas de terreno en nuestro territorio.

El inicio de cada una de estas rondas es donde realmente es interesante el juego. Cobramos dinero en función de cómo sea nuestro reino y de si tenemos jugadores por delante nuestro en la puntuación. Despues robaremos tres losetas que colocaremos delante nuestro. En secreto (usando una pantalla) marcaremos una de ellas para eliminarla y en las otras dos pondremos dinero (precio). Una vez todos estamos listos levantamos la pantalla y en orden de turno podemos comprar una loseta de otros jugadores. Cuando todos hayan comprado o no una loseta, las que nos queden delante nos las quedaremos pagando el dinero que hemos puesto como precio. De esto modo cuando todos hayan actuados tendremos de 0 a tres losetas para ampliar nuestro reino

Estas losetas tienen representados tipos de terreno (montañas, prados y agua) teniendo que seguir la coherencia de terrenos con las que ya tenemos colocadas. Además del terreno hay diferentes símbolos. Principalmente barriles, que si están unidos por caminos con nuestro castillo nos darán dinero al inicio del turno y luego animales, barcos y otros dibujicos que son necesarios para puntuar.

Porque al final de cada una de las rondas se van a puntuar entre una y tres cosas. Esas puntuaciones se saben al principio de la partida y permiten irte preparando para ellas. Cada una de las cuatro categorías se van a puntuar tres veces a lo largo de la partida, eso sí en diferentes rondas.

An unintuitive game.
I find the mechanism of pricing your tiles the most annoying.
Little fun when you think mainly how not to make a grave mistake and not to help your opponents by accident.  More stress than fun.

With 3+ players I can sense a massive downtime (each player scanning painstakingly opponents' tableaux) or a happy, chaotic play when everybody plays just for himself not caring about what others do.
2-player mode is probably the best.

My rating (7) may go up after more plays. I played this for the 3rd and 4th time while at BGG Spring, and noticed that it was more fun than when I'd first played it. The pressure of correctly pricing tiles while also mitigating randomness and leaving yourself multiple ways to succeed in a round is really compelling. 

It's group-dependent, in that if one player is playing particularly poorly or makes strange decisions it has a large impact on the game. Still, I happily bought it and look forward to 10-15 plays in the next year.

Bokkensprong 16/9/16 met Ward (bijna 12), Jens De Meester, Luc, Ann en ik. Tegellegspel dat op het eerste zicht op Carcassonne lijkt, gespeeld in vijf ronden. Per ronde veranderen de scorecriteria. Elke speler trekt blind drie tegels uit de zak, legt ze open voor zich, en duidt in het geheim aan welke tegel terug in de zak moet, en wat de prijs is voor elk van de overige twee. Dan worden de kostprijzen openbaar gemaakt. In volgorde kunnen de spelers ev. één tegel elders kopen (en aanleggen), voor de prijs die werd bepaald door de verkoper. Tegels de niet gekocht worden, moeten worden betaald en aangelegd door de eigenaar. Er is een mechanisme ingebouwd waarbij spelers die in de laatste ronden achterop liggen, sterk worden bevoordeeld. De eindscores liggen daarom dicht bij elkaar. Leuk spel, met wel voortdurend wat telwerk voor de scores.

Pretty straightforward game of collecting things that are worth points, with some occasional collecting of things that make other things worth some points. The actual tile laying itself felt mostly trivial, so it's really just an auction game where the auctions are slightly weirdly structured, and the things your auctioning for are just worth a calculable amount of points. Not super exciting or unique but I enjoyed myself and I could see enjoying myself with it again.

A very mediocre tile laying game with auctions. I played this with five and maybe that's just too many. With there's a lot going on and frankly, it would take a lot of time for everyone to try to account for all of their opponents boards and their own. That effort isn't worth it IMO for such a light game. Maybe with 2-3 players this would be a lot better and even faster but as we played it, it just wasn't very good. I'll try it again with less players which could bump up the rating a LITTLE bit but this will never show up on my favorites/wanted lists.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2016)

Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King was utterly unknown to me. When I saw the game was from Lookout Games my interest increased, but then I found the game was about tile laying (a mechanic I dislike most of the time) so I almost didn’t play it. However, I’m glad I did because I enjoyed it.

The game rules are very easy to learn. You can explain them under 15 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes.

The game components are very good and the art is good as well. When the game is on the table, it looks rather similar to Carcassonne, fortunately, it plays nothing like it.

It is weird that you can leave roads unconnected, but I welcome the novelty of it. 

Isle of Skye has a huge replayability factor because you play with 4 different goals each time and they appear in different order each time (I love this).

The game decisions aren’t obvious, in fact knowing how to value each of your tiles (similar to Key Harvest, a game I like) is very fun and it is the best feature of the game.

It is reminiscent of Between Two Cities (a game I also played for the first time this month) but Isle of Skye is superior in every way. Here you have meaningful decisions and luck is much more controlled.

On the bad side, I’m not a fan of artificial catch-up mechanisms, I don’t like that the last players get money for being behind, but it is a minor issue at the moment.

Isle of Skye has a light-medium weight, I was expecting a heavier game from Lookout Games.

Bottom line, I kind of like it, but my desire to play it again isn’t that high. That could change with more plays, but for now I won’t buy it. It is a good family game.

RATING: 8
I'm Scottish. I couldn't resist. 

Fortunately it's a pretty good mix of auctions and Carcassonne-like tile laying, the key thing being you set the price of the tiles you want to sell, and you have to (or get to, depending on whether you really wanted the tile or not) pay the price you've set if no-one else will.

The tile laying's pretty simple, but the challenge is in managing to balance the points-scoring symbols on the tiles and how easy it is to place them as the location of the tiles (or more specifically, how they mesh together) as that's also significant for scoring.

Good mix of lightweight rules (takes about 5 minutes to explain) and middleweight tactics. I can't abide overwrought Euros that feel like algebra home work disguised as a game, but this one hits the mark for me.

That there are sixteen scoring tiles (only four which of are used in each game, with the order in which they're being played being significant) should add variety and give it longer legs.

Rules are slightly confusing and I don't see why you shouldn't be able to buy more than one tile each turn.  I like randomness in games, but this one seems to have a bit too much.  It needs a little more control.

I've played twice now and. although the second time was a much better experience, it's still a tentative purchase... there are better Pfister games out there.

Better than Carcassonne, but not enough to sell Carcassonne and buy it. The auction was a bit off-putting for me - it's a relatively light game but with an assholish "I'm gonna steal your stuff" auction. My $0.02.

This game, on first play is a pleasant surprise. It feels, to me, like one of the mini games in a Feld Design met Carcassone, fell in love whilst playing Fields of Aryle and had a child - FoA is that child. The 16 scoring tiles make for varied gameplay and strategy, while the tile drafting/buying/ bluffing mechanic provides plenty of player interaction and fun. This is a great medium-Light filler of the Euro persuasion that I can't wait to explore some more.

Lovely game! I look forward to playing again and seeing how it works with multiple players!

Isle of Skye is a simple economic tile-laying game. Each turn, players draw three tiles, discard one, and using their own money, set a price on the other two tiles that other players are invited to match. Each player has the option of matching the price of one tile of a another player or passing. Any tiles that do not get selected are purchased by the seller for the price they had set. These tiles are added to a personal tableau or territory that is built very much like in Carcassonne. Before each game, four tiles are drawn that determine how tiles score throughout the game and you try to devise a territory that maximizes the scoring criteria for that particular game. 

It's a very straight-forward game that works for a lighter game night or for a family game night. Why do I like it? I have not seen another family game where players have to determine the value of a tile not just for themselves, but for other players as well. The key to the game is in the price-setting - knowing how high or low to set a price based on what you anticipate the demand for the tile to be. Price-setting is often a feature of heavy-weight economic games, but I have not seen it put to such excellent use in a package that can get my kids excited about doing something that I do all the time in games they that are not yet ready to appreciate. Playing this game has brought my kids closer to seeing games as I see them and valuing in them what I value. I hope their interest holds.

I was hoping this game would resurrect [thing=822][/thing] for me.  It didn't. I had high hopes and was bitterly disappointed.  Instead of feeling tension with the varied scoring mechanism, it felt contrived, even wonky.  I love the tile laying feature in [thing=122515][/thing]. There, you are building your city and building your engine.  Here, it doesn't feel like I am building anything.  I am counting sheep and whiskey kegs. Then, I am laying down a boat tile so I can score in the "A" window.  :snore:  There are games with much better payoffs at this weight and with playing time.  Given a choice, I'd choose [thing=822][/thing].  

To be fair, there were some interesting features in this game.  I loved the auction mechanism.  You name the price for the tiles you sell.  You either pay that amount, or receive that amount from your opponents.  I also liked the feature of trashing one of the tiles you draw.  A great way to bury a tile that may help your opponent.

But in the end, the auction did not save it for me.  I may try it again, but it doesn't seem like there is much to explore here.  Yes, you will have different victory conditions, but to me, whether you are competing to collect boats or yaks, it just feels the same to me.

If I am going to lay tiles, I will play [thing=122515][/thing] or [thing=63759][/thing].

The more I play it the more I like it! The rules are elegant and dirt simple, but give way to relatively deep and engaging game play. You could hardly want more from a 45 minute game.

The variety of scoring tiles and their order coupled with the tile draw each game leads to an impressive amount of replayability. However, the real beauty of the game is in the auction. It is rife with interesting decisions and considerations. 

I really like the game at 2 and 3, but I'm a bit less enthusiastic about higher player counts. The massive disparity of income in the later rounds is a bit wonky and encourages players to trail leading into the later rounds a bit too strongly. For that reason it boosts the importance of the D scoring tile and end game scrolls.

Isle of Skye is brilliant for the way that the rules quickly get out of the way to let you play the game. Whether it's a result of playing off the familiarity of Carcassonne when it comes to tile placement, you become accustomed to what it is you have to do very quickly and it makes determining what tiles you're looking for easy to identify. And then when tiles start showing up with end-game bonuses or income potential, you start weighing the benefits of your choices... In any instance, I haven't had any problem with misunderstandings in this game; the sequence of play makes sense, the scoring tiles are brilliantly illustrated and easy to figure out - the only hurdle seems to be in the initial buying round and understanding where the money goes when someone buys a tile vs. when it's left in front of you after a buying round. Even so, it's still remarkably easy to grasp after playing through - it's just the unsupported explanation that throws people; which may mean it's more the way I'm explaining it than any issues with clarity in the rules. The wide variety of scoring tiles and the random order in how they come out increases replay-ability, giving each play a slightly different, yet no less impressive, flavour. Money well spent.

A successful blend of known mechanisms but nothing outstanding. The most remarkable feature is the simultaneous hidden price setting for the drawn tiles. The rest is standard tile-laying with variable VP conditions each game increasing replay value.

While appealing, the pricing mechanism falls short of its potential. All item prices develop similarly across players from round to round with only slight differences between tiles depending on their usefulness in regard to the respective VP conditions selected for the game. I would have wished for a more differentiating experience. A surprising element is the implemented catch-up mechanism awarding players behind in VPs additional money. The sensible tactic is the Power Grid method to stay close behind the competitors to pass them on the last turn, aided here by a good money to VP conversion rate. I’m not sure why this mechanism is necessary. Potentially, the authors saw the possibility of players getting screwed by bad tile draws or perhaps it’s just an additional element to increase the depth of this light to midweight Euro.

A great game which is an absolute blast to play for everyone. Looks like carcassonne but plays completely different. The best is the crazy amount of replayability thanks to the 16+ (with mini expansions) scoring tiles of which only 4 are used each play. Only thing that really annoys me is that other players can buy you out. You can try to prevent this but it can happen that you have rounds where you are not able to place any (usable) tile at all which really can set you back. It happens seldom but when it happens you ate almost unable to recover, even with the implemented coin-catchup-mechanic.

Much clunkier than Carcassone in every way... really. This game isn't all that easy to teach (shouldn't be in "Family" in my opinion) and doesn't come together quite right. 

But yet, I really enjoy playing it. I love combining lots of mechanisms together (Blood Rage for example), and this game just jams them together. Like set collecting? Check. Auction bidding? Check. Secret information/bluffing? Check. Tile-laying/Building? Check. I don't suggest this one unless you are the type to enjoy game expansions... because this game feels like it already has an expansion module or three inserted into the core gameplay.

Much better Carcassonne. The main differences are an auction mechanic to determine what tiles you get to use instead of random draw, different scoring in different rounds each game for replayability, and you play on your own set of tiles, not a central board with meeples.

For a tile laying game too much down time, and things look for.
First you have your own three tiles to check, then check other players tiles, then see what other players might need, and then wonder how much tiles should cost. For four players, this means it takes forever for players to evaluate their needs and prices.

If I want to play a tile laying game, I rather play any Carcassonne version.

Un Carcassonne pour gamers. Se joue rapidement. Intéressante mécanique à la Castle of Mad King Ludwig où chaque joueur doit estimer la valeur que les autres sont prêts à payer pour leurs tuiles. Bonne rejouabilité à prévoir avec les scoring différents, quoique ce principe rend aussi certaines tuiles inutiles et donc de peu de valeur (ex: on a eu aucun scoring avec les animaux dans notre partie). Les filles n'ont pas aimé que l'on puisse retourner les tuiles pour les placer où que les chemins puissent finir dans une montagne, l'expérience préalable de Carcassonne faisait un blocage mental pour le placement. À réessayer, pour l'instant 7.5/10

This was a pleasant surprise. The rules are really not much to talk about but it offers quite some brainburny goodness. It also plays quite fast with two...

Pleasantly quick playing auction and tile laying exercise, though it can cause some annoying AP. The scoring system and the bidding system are both neat and innovative. I don't think this would keep on being amusing in the long run, though, but it can be decent occasional fun.

M: Ta gra kojarzy mi się z Carcassonne, choć jest bardziej rozbudowana i ma więcej elementów. Czasem nie mogę jej ogarnąć, czasem zapominam o najprostszych rzeczach, ale lubię ją. Fajnym motywem są licytacje i ustawianie pieniążków za barykadą, tak by inni gracze nie widzieli jak wyceniam kafelki.

K:
Taki trochę Carcassonne, ale kilka poziomów wyżej. Bardzo dobrze działający mechanizm licytacji (nawet na 2, a to nie jest tak często spotykane) oraz bardzo ciekawy sposób punktowania, który sprawia, że każda partia jest inna to bardzo duże plusy tej gry.

RATING: 7
Isle of Skye is a great tile laying game. The luck factor of drawing the right tile in Carcassonne is excellently mitigated by having the players draw three tiles, set prices for them and giving the other players the chance to buy the tiles for these prices. This alone is brilliant. The many combinations of scoring tiles add a huge amount of variability to the game. Thumbs up from me!

Even though it being an AP prone game, the catch up mechanic and the limited options seem to make the end scoring in the end a luck-of-the-draw.

I really struggled on whether to rate this a 7 or an 8. Ultimately I think it depends on your player count. 2p? 7. 3-4p? 8. Just because it impacts the bidding aspect so much.

Isle of Skye is a fast tile-laying game where you're building your own piece of the Highlands according to whatever's in vogue that season (aka what scoring tiles have been drawn). You'll sell of tiles and purchase any unsold tiles plus one of your opponent's tiles. Try to make proper evaluations or you'll pay for it!

Loving this game after two plays. You purchase tiles and place them in your kingdom based on a variety of possible scoring opportunities. You have end-of-round scoring as well as end-of-game scoring so which tiles you get and how you place them can earn you points as you go. I also love the purchasing mechanic, where each person selects three tiles each round and places them for all players to see. Each player secretly sets the price for each tile (with their actual money) and also chooses one tile to discard, leaving you with two tiles for sale. Then everyone reveals the prices they set for each tile and each player has the opportunity to buy one tile from another player. The buyer pays the price to the owner, and then the owner not only gets the paid amount, but they also keep the money that they set for that tile price. It becomes a delicate balance between what you think other players may want to buy and not letting it go too cheaply, because any tile that isn't purchased by another player becomes one that you keep, and you lose the money that you set the price with. Very tasty.

Underrated? There are not so many games that are able to mix strategy, tactics and high player count into 60 minutes.

The group needs to understand metagame though. Screwage factor if some player loses out of all tiles two times is just too big. I never saw someone come back from this. Same like having build three tiles in two rounds is also too good. The group needs to keep track of this.

Wasn't a huge fan of this. The scoring is randomized each game which is a nice touch, but I wasn't able to score any points until the third round out of six so I fell behind and wasn't able to make any kind of a comeback by the end. I don't feel the need to play this again.

I'm in the camp that feels there are so many better tile laying games be it Cacao, Alhambra or Carcassonne.  The auction mechanic added here is less fun than say Castles of Mad King Ludwig both as this game lacks in theme and it's just not fun to work out what to bid exactly.  Again there are just a lot of other games where the individual mechanics work so much better and the combo here just doesn't produce anything unique in terms of fun and both the theme and art also lack in comparison.  So it's all just ok in the end.

A very cool auction/tile laying game from the designer of Broom Service and Mombasa. I have liked all of his designs thus far and this one doesn't disappoint.

- Getting tiles you want taken from you makes this less enjoyable than similar games like Carcassonne. You can also prevent a player from winning with this mechanic, which I consider to be a flaw of the game.

RATING: 2
TRY BEFORE YOU BUY

Played once with 4 or 5, and a second time with 3. Disclaimer: I didn't win either, became 2nd in both.

-1 nobody liked it. It is overhyped in amazon and the likes.
-1 too chaotic, almost no sense of accomplishment, 
-1 the bidding can result in you having crappy tiles or having your great cards taken away. 
-1 Scoring is too sudden and too erratic. Can hardly 'build' towards it.
-1 Thematically bad, there is only one skye IRL, why has everyone their own skye? Also the end result roads look bad, where does the whiskey come from...

I give it a 2 not a 1 because it serves at least the goal of getting nonsuspecting beginners into the genre, and that serves my self interest in the sense that there are more people I can potentially talk to about board games.

Based on the fact it's a tile-laying game with tiles somewhat similar to that of Carcassonne, this game is often compared to Carcassonne. In my eyes the two are fundamentally different.
At its core, Isle of Skye has the Biblios/Merchants of Amsterdam mechanism without the plush your luck but with more planning: you draw three tiles, discard one, offer two for fixed-price 'auctions' (of which 0, 1 or 2 might be sold), buy the remaining one(s) and place them (along with the ones you bought from others) in your tableau. This is what the game is aboout, and the scoring options, of which there are 16 (besides a few set collection ones that are shown on certain cards), 5 of which don't even have any spatial aspect. But luckily the rest do, just like the placement rules (which do differ from that of Carcassonne) and the rules for gaining gold in the beginning of your game, so even if the central mechanism of the game is not about tile laying, in the end it is very important. And that's good, as I like tile-laying, even though I prefer games where you lay these tiles in one common 'map' and not just in your own tableau.
So, how is the game? It's fine. Yes, it might have a bit more scoring options (within any one game) than necessary but it's just as many as in Kingdom Builder which the variability of the game reminds of.
Also, after one or two plays it does play fast - our third, 2-player game (we played it with Saci again on Saturday) lasted only 30 minutes. It's good as in a 2-player play I think the role of luck can be a bit high (too many cards remain in the bag without even drawing them once, also there are two few cards at the opponent you can choose from). However, the game is quite well scaled for different player numbers: even though probably 4-player is ideal and 3 is very good, it seems to be good for 5 as well (having one fewer rounds was introduced so that each player can be the starting player once, but it also shortens the game that could otherwise become a bit long for what it is). So we played 3- and 2-player and I enjoyed both; I'm ready to explore it further.

RATING: 6
[2016.Mar.24] (Tentative rating after 2 plays.) A bit concerned that the player from whom both tiles are purchased more than once (the "oversold player") is at a significant disadvantage. In both games played to date, the oversold player who had both of his tiles purchased in the 1st and 2nd turns had an insurmountable point deficit with regard to the other players and in both games, the oversold player came in last place.

Gave this one away unpunched as the artwork made me nauseus. Gameplay turned out alright, I guess. Liked the variable setup even though the goals themselves didn't excite me much.

A "gamier" Carcassonne with less satisfaction.

Certainly my discovery of 2015.  Fast playing, smart, auction based, tile laying game with good depth and tons of replayability.  Player interaction is indirect (through auctions) but very significant.  Can't say enough good things about it.  With the same vibe as Carcassonne but such a better game.

Rating based after one play with 5 players, using the pictured scoring tiles for our first game.
The buying/bidding mechanic of tiles creates a lot of little frustrations in the group :-)
There can be too much downtime as they go through all their possibilities.

I like to try it a few more times with less players ( 3 -4) to see if my opinion changes. Therefore I recommend trying before buying.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I have a hard time not thinking of roads as borders for determining areas but only land types count (land, sea, mountains). Each game will be unique in what drives scoring as the four main in game scoring tiles are randomly drawn from a pile of 12-16 tiles. The colors are vibrant. The price setting aspect reminds me a bit of Key Harvest but this one can be nasty in that you could theoretically end up with no tiles to place if you choose not to buy one and people buy the two tiles you put out for sale. Some tiles also involve end game scoring aspects. Plays quickly.

Jeder Spieler erhält 3 Carcassonne-Artige Plättchen und legt sie vor sich. Hinter seinem Sichtschirm definieren alle jewels den Preis zweier Plättchen und eines das abgeworfen wird. Es fogt eine Kaufrunde. Beginnend beim Startspieler darf sich jeder kein bis ein Plättchen kaufen. Alle Plättchen die dann noch vor einem liegen muss man selbst kaufen. Danach dürfen alle gekauften Plättchen in sein Königreich (Carcassonne Regeln im Grunde) eingebaut werden und man erhält Siegpunkte, die von der aktuellen Runde und der Siegpunktplättchenauslage abhängig ist. Es folgt die zweite Runde. Nach 5 Runden ist es auch schon vorbei und es gibt einen Geinner bzw. eine Gewinnerin.
Ich finde den Bietmechnismus sehr gut, da ich mich in Andere hineinversetzen muss, was sie zahlen würden oder eben nicht mehr.
Das Plättchen auslegen ist nichts spannendes, aber was mich stört ist die Siegpunktevergabe. Diese ist jede Runde ein wenig anders und nicht so klar wie bei Carcassonne. Der Wiederspielreiz erhöht sich durch die wechselnden Siegpunkteplättchen, aber mir gefällt das nicht. Jeder spielt auch auf seinem Hofplan und es gibt keine gemeinsame Auslage.
Im Grunde ein gutes funktionierendes Spiel, aber ich spiele wirklich lieber Carcassonne (oder ein anderes Spiel), wobei ich mich auch nicht sträube weiter mitzuspielen.

I was happy to see the neat pricing/selling system from Key Harvest used in this game.

I enjoy this more than Castles of Mad King Ludwig because you get to set prices every round in Isle of Skye.

RATING: 6
I love tile layers, however, there is some variability here that is oven slanted heavily to the negative for me. Sometimes, the scoring conditions are broad, and it's a nice contest between all players. Other times, the combination of conditions are far to specific, forcing more singular strategies, often rewarding luck of the drawn heavily.

Many times I enjoy this game, though a few sessions have left a bad taste in my mouth. I will play, but often swapping out a condition if the combination seems less favorable for the variety of choices. The good part is, this system supports this minor tweaking well.

Auction-ish and tile laying game.  Some goal oriented play as well.  It's pretty and has some neat synergies to exploit.  However, the game is has too few actions and too little depth as a consequence.  Not bad but not going into any Euro hall of fame.

Nice workaround of carcassonne to me. No boredom, short game rounds, nice variations at the VP scoring table and like the sell / buy mechanics. Some of my playmates has problems at seeing combinate the pieces to each other. Some imagination power is needed to see the selling pieces at the own realm. So i understand when not everyone get into the game, but it`s one of the better games for five players which take not hours of playtime.

Unique bidding mechanic where you draw three tiles and place a price behind a screen and select one tile to "axe".  After you reveal you can buy one tile from another player based on the price set. You buy your own tiles with the price set if no one buys your tile.  

Tiles are placed Carcassonne style.  There are four random scoring conditions that score three times over six rounds.

The bidding is interesting with the closed economy.  My initial reaction is a 5.  But the game plays quickly.  I would be willing to try this game again.

RATING: 7
An interesting blend of mechanics that mostly works.  I like the variable victory conditions.  The auction price setting is obscure to me.  And the money catch up mechanism seems odd in a game with so much end and late game scoring opportunities.  The biggest issue I have is with some graphic design choices which especially clash with the superficial similarity to Carcassonne.

Misses the mark for me at 2 players.

Instead, we enjoy adjusting the game, both the auction and the scoring. Eventually we will have laid all the tiles available, using a faster and more altruistic distribution method (eg, draw 4, keep 2 each, give 3rd to your partner, auction the 4th). I have more fun laying tiles (3-5 per turn each player!) than stressing over auction bids.  The maps of course become much larger and more satisfying than in rules as written.

My go to tile game since it combines a bit of Castles of Mad King Ludwig and Carcassonne, plus Kingdom Builder type of scoring.

Update after 8 plays: Still enjoy the scoring options, but not a fan of the auction.  Most auction games don't excite me for very long and I really don't like auctions where you set a price and hope someone bites on it.  Thought the various scoring tiles would help keep this on the table, but it couldn't overcome my lack of enjoyment during the auction phase.  Never had a desire to pull it out.  Would still happily play someone else's copy, but it didn't earn a permanent spot on my shelf.

This is a great family tile laying / head scratching working out the economic value of tiles game. It works well with all level of gamers and all player counts. Every game will be different due to the 16 different scoring tiles and that you only use 4 of them in each game. This will change up each game drastically and hugely adds to replayability.

The artwork is just as good as the smooth gameplay and as a result it is extremely easy to teach and both of my younger kids have picked up the game with no problems. But being good at it is another matter!

The game is played over 6 rounds and the main board will tell you which of the scoring tiles are scored at the end of each round. Each player takes 3 tiles from a bag (think Carcassonne tiles and you can't go wrong) and places them in front of their Scottish clan screen (did I forget to mention you play as Scottish clans and there are whiskey barrels, lighthouses, ships and ... what look like yaks, all the usual Scottish stuff, could almost be a game of Glen More another personal favourite). Each player then chooses secretly safely behind their castle walls which of the three tiles to discard and puts a monetary value (using the actually money they have at their disposal) on the other two tiles. Then all is revealed and in player turn you have the option to buy one of the other players tiles at the price they have set (but no you can't use the money you used to set the value of your tiles, that would be way to easy!). If no one chooses to buy your tile(s) you have to at the cost you priced it at paying with the money you used to set its value.

This method of pricing and acquiring tiles is fantastic and meaty for such a smooth running game. Money flows to and from you throughout the game and is in a constant changing state of flux. A bit like real life except in that it mainly seems to flow away from me and bits of colourful cardboard in boxes flows back!

The tile laying itself is just as good. Each game will force you to create very different lands depending on the scoring tile requirements.

This is just a great game and no description can do its simplicity, meatiness, variability and delightful turns of economy justice.

If you game with your family try this. If you play with mainly experienced gamers try this. It is like a lemon sorbet fizzing on your palette after a huge meal of chateaubriand. Light and delicious, it reaffirms your belief that you enjoy gaming and could wolf down some more.

Great game.

What a great game! Pricing the tiles just right is challenging and rewarding. What if the tile is too good for the other player? What if they don't have enough money? How much am I willing to pay for my tile, if no one buys it? Decisions. Truly a game where you learn from your mistakes the second you can't undo them. Only con is that the game might be too long with AP prone people. And it really punishes people who aren't good at the game, because you might need to plan for all kinds of tiles, when building your landscape. Still, this just gets better every time you play.

This is everything I wanted it to be: Carcassonne-like, but with a tight round limit, variable scoring, and an auction mechanic. I absolutely love how rich with decisions it is.

Every single choice has a branching tree of possible consequences, and while that meant we took it past its 60-minute listed play time by thinking too long during bidding, it also meant that every decision was interesting. (A second play with the same group would have gone a lot faster, I suspect. It needs a learning game.) As a huge fan of turn angst, I love this game.

I'm also a fan of games I enjoy losing, and I went from doing well, to first, to dead last in my first game of IoS -- and had a blast the whole time. At the midgame, we were all within 2 points of each other; towards the end, the two players with the strongest, best-executed strategy pulled way ahead. I drove home thinking about things I could have done differently, and how to approach it next time; always a good sign.

I'm also looking forward to dealing four random scoring conditions next time (rather than the preset "first game four"), and to how much variety and replayability that introduces into an already varied and interesting game.

More to this one than initially appears. Sort of a mix of Carcassonne's tile placement, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig-esque pricing. Plays nicely, though it may have a runaway leader issue.

Edit: A couple of times the relative scoring positions have been the same from start to finish, but I think that some experience will change this. As leading player, the others could have totally priced me out of buying good tiles, but were too conservative with their money.

Bought from Kingslayer Comics using MTG Store Credit 9/13/16.

The mechanisms were simple, but what surprised me was the depth of the decisions in the bidding phase. I normally hate bidding games, but this was actually my favorite part of the game.  Watching my clan's island grow was great and Mary told me that she already loved it half way through the first round. The variable scoring is just awesome.

---
Update 10/14/16.  Rating increased from 8.5 to 9.  The replayability of this is off the charts.  The variable scoring is great and makes each game truly different.  The price setting mechanic is really growing on me, and the quick play time make it one of our top go-to games.

Neat little tile layer with a great auction mechanic. All the decisions are tricky here - what tile to discard, what to price your tiles at, which one to buy, and how to lay your tile on the board.

Good game, liked it, but don't need to own it.  Has a bidding mechanism, money generation and variable VP scoring methods on top of tile placement. And an ability to choose / burn tiles which isn't present in Carcassone.

But for a Scottish themed tile placement game, I'd easily take Glen More.

Looks like Carc Advanced but feels very different. The market mechanism is not really our favourite thing. Similar to CoMKL but not quite as agonizing. We're not well suited for this stuff, but it's more bearable here. We like the game enough to keep it, but it's not a game for all occasions.

Carcassonne meets Castles of Mad King Ludwig, with a little more depth than Cacao. A good family/light euro that plays silky smooth. Tough to find games of this length/depth that satisfy.

Decided this is deserving of a rare 10 after several plays. It is a perfect game for its weight. 45 minutes, just enough to think about, smooth flowing, tons of replayability.

Not bad. It is a Carc.-variation, trying to include some more interaction. Draw tiles, assign a price to them. Next everybody can buy one tile from an opponent. downside is that if you get robbed in the first turns (because you had drawn good tiles) your landscape cannot grow much. So you miss out on points right from the start. After a bad start it is hard to come back. I saw that happening to someone. So: the activity to play this, riding the different scoring conditions each round, is fun. However the game has risks of a runaway leader and a rich get richer problem.

Combines Carcassone tile-laying with Neuroshima Hex's tile burn with a bidding/econ/push-your-luck game to great success.

Each component is fairly standard in how it works, but when combined as a complete package, it creates a great game that favors quick, on-your-toes thinking and strategizing.

With multiple victory conditions that rotate from game to game and a good randomization mechanic, newcomers and veterans will find themselves on more equal footing than games with static win cons.

This is a game that is, what I like to call, a more advanced version of Carcassonne. Mainly because you score based on what tiles you play, not what areas you place a meeple on a larger board!

Auctioning and tableau building. Yes please. Gorgeous art, and it’s a I set the price you choose to buy mechanic that works well, even at 2p. Only gripe at 2p is that if you’re first player and don’t buy a tile from opponent, you Must concede to the fact you might only be placing 1 tile that round. Maybe a simple dummy player varient could spice things up?

I really wasn't sure how the economic system in this game would work but it's so smooth and intuitive and clever.  The variable scoring really helps replay and the scattered scoring rounds for objectives is great.  Some of the scorings are a bit confusing, but overall this game certainly deserves all the praise it gets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell: Players set up a market of tiles for purchase then play them into a puzzle to score in various ways.

Played as: 5 player

Pros: Very intuitive game rules-wise while still offering some variability in which scoring tiles are used and offering some gut wrenching choices when pricing the tiles in your market.

Cons: Those gut-wrenching choices when pricing your tiles can slow things down. Also, each round ends in scoring a mini point-salad (more so in later rounds) which seems to take a fair chunk of the game's playing time. I'm probably overstating those two time sinks in the grand scheme of this not being that long of a game, but I'd say 2/3 of the play time is on those two parts of the game. I was really excited going into the game about the tile laying aspect, but found the interesting aspects of that mechanic neutered leaving nothing more then a somewhat obvious jigsaw puzzle. And for some reason, I never got that end of game sense of "look what I built!"

Other: Reading the above, would make someone think I didn't like the game all that much, but it really is nice. It's probably a result of delivering a product, not necessarily worse, but different then my expectations. It's really a very solid piecing together of established designs. I expect I might like the game more with fewer players (only played with the max 5 players) as scoring and surveying a smaller market would reduce those more drawn out element of the game. 

Best Use: A shorter "buy-tiles-in-a-common-market-then build-your-own-puzzle-with-them" game (think Vegas Showdown, Princes of Florence, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, etc.).

Mi opinión en [b]http://zacatrus.es/u/miqueljornet[/b]:

☛ Lo tengo desde que salió en inglés y me encanta. En septiembre de 2015 predije que podía ser nominado a los SdJ (finalmente -y todavía no entiendo por qué- lo ha sido en la categoría "Kenner" -para expertos- y creo que no ganará estando emparejado con bestias pardas como Pandemic Legacy y T.I.M.E Stories). Celebro su edición en castellano.

✔ La combinación de objetivos diferentes a puntuar cada partida lo hacen muy rejugable.
✔ La duración de una partida está muy bien ajustada.
✔ El reglamento es impecable a la par que sencillo.
✔ Se puede sacar tanto a aficionados a los juegos como a neófitos.
✔ La parte de tasar losetas para comprarlas y/o conservarlas genera una interacción orgánica muy agradable.
✔ La calidad de los componentes y de la producción son el paradigma de juego accesible, usable y rejugable típico de los Spiel des Jahres.

✘ La rejugabilidad que ofrecen los objetivos de puntuación combinables tiene un doble filo: en determinadas ocasiones las partidas pueden resultar algo monótonas si todos los objetivos son similares.
✘ Se aplica una mecánica de compensación (en forma de monedas) para los jugadores que van más rezagados en el track de puntuación al final de cada ronda. Eso puede no gustar a determinados jugadores. 
✘ A cuatro jugadores, los dos primeros serán "jugador inicial" dos veces durante la partida y los dos últimos sólo una. Discutí en la BGG con los autores sobre si esto podía afectar al juego y convenimos que no... pero aún así creo que se podría haber resuelto de una manera más elegante.

I knew I was going to like this game before I even played it. Each player are building up a landscape akin to what you do in Carcassonne, except instead of drawing a single tile out of a bag and placing it, you draw three, and you in secret give one of them the axe and the other two a price. You have to balance the prices you set with how much money you decide to hold back, as once players remove their player screens, they each get a chance to purchase one of the other players' tiles. If you decide to purchase a tile, you pay the other player the price they have set for the tile, and they get to pick back up the money they themselves had put down on that tile - giving them that much more purchase power either in this game round or the next.

Once all players have gotten the chance to purchase a tile or pass, the money they have put down on the tiles their opponents didn't buy from them goes to the bank and they add the tiles they have purchased to their landscape.

Scoring varies from round to round as the game has four different scoring condition (drawn from a decent stack of scoring tiles) that triggers in a different combination with each round, making players weigh the importance of gaining points in the current round against building up to score big in the next round. You also have to weigh whether it's better to go for a round-scoring tile (all scoring conditions are triggered three times in a game) or a scroll that will give you points at the end of the game. There's also an interesting handicap bonus in the game, where players receive an increasing amount of money for every player ahead of them in the game with every passing round.

I've played this game both as a 2-player game and as a 5-player game and I've found both versions enjoyable, but very different in terms of strategy. A 2-player game is naturally very back and forth, and you are guaranteed to always at least have one tile to add to your landscape. While in a 5-player game, there are no guarantees you will keep any of your given tiles and you have to rely more on keeping enough money on hand to make a purchase. 

I really enjoy the deeper, yet simple enough to grasp strategy in this game, as it gives a fresh take on the tile-laying mechanic.

Carcassonne...Extreme!  Just a bit too much crammed in there, and the various scoring at different times was cumbersome.  The I price you choose mechanism was a good one, so I will give it that.  Graphic design made it a bit tough to read the maps, and we were not too fond of the ability to just terminate roads.  In the end, just too much crammed in for the apparent sake of it.

It was an enjoyable game but it didn't strike me as... wow, i want to play this again and again. Personally there were too many different symbols on the cards. It didn't need much explaining though. I didn't like the tile placement that much. There were too many little things to take into account and it was easy to make a mistake and lay the tile in a wrong way.

I did like the "auction" part in which you determine the price and have to pay it yourself if nobody wants it. Also there seem to be a lot of variability included in the box so you can play it again and again. Which i probably won't do. I won't refuse to play it but when there are alternatives, this game will probably not be my first choice.

Nice strategy game, played only with two players. Games last ~40 minutes.

+ Graphics on cards. Nice to the eyes, relaxing cards.
+ Quality of all items.
+ A great variance in strategies in each game due to the random A-B-C-D cards in each game.
+ Even more variety in strategy due to the extra VP papyrus and the ability to "close" lands.
+ Every game feels different due to the above points.

- In a two player game, the +3 coins to the one behind, can be a bit overpowering, if the difference is only 1 VP.
- In a >2 player game, you can be left with no cards in your hands in a turn if not planned correctly.
- Luck can still be a deciding factor.

Considering the low price for this game I'd recommend buying it immediately without really thinking why. It's a great game to enjoy, especially with the family and is both intriguing and when you get to the end of the game in most cases you'll be surprised at how fast it went. Time only flies when you're having fun and since that's what happened to my gaming group this game is a lot of fun! And why get board games if not for fun?
Every player gets some tiles at the beginning of their turn which they either try to sell by giving them relatively low prices (or medium at most) or they plan to buy themselves and so give them a higher cost. If someone buys your tiles they pay you the amount of money you would have paid for the tile and you get to keep your money. If nobody buys your tiles you'll have to pay the amount of money you would have paid and the tile is yours. Players then try to build a small kingdom by both getting more whiskey barrels in order to receive more money each turn and they try to get the specific animals, structures, etc in their little kingdom, depending on the current missions.
There are a lot of fun elements in this game and even though I've never played Carcassonne I bet that Isle of Skye is better than it since it both has the interesting element of building your kingdom (but it also has a lot of different kinds of animals, buildings, etc on the tiles which all do something as well) and the fascinating concept of buying and selling. Not good at board games? Then this is the game for you (even though it's still a great game if you are good at board games)! Players who are behind receive more money which is very important in the game and then get a chance to catch up. It's a very family friendly game, quite simple but can be a little confusing since you have to concentrate on at least four different objectives. All in all, no need for words. It's both interesting AND cheap!

I like the auction mechanic a lot, it is very original in an otherwise pretty standard tile laying game. I like the changing score tiles, but some combinations are less interesting than others. I don't like the artwork. It is functional, but the tiles are filled with ugly icons. I don't like that players get extra money if they are behind in points in the later rounds. It's a catch up mechanic that I don't care for at all. It is pretty hard to set the right price for the tiles. It helps if you know how much money the other players have, but I don't like remembering that sort of things in games. The 2 player game isn't great. The four player is better. In the end I like Carcasonne better with more interaction and without the auction and catch up mechanism.

This one is a simple tile placement game with a cool auction mechanic and lots of scoring rounds

I really like the auction part of the game... it's great to have to look at what other players have that you might want to grab... look at the tiles in front of you and decide how to price them in terms of how much you want them or how much you know others will want them and also to decide which tile to ace from the game... 
It's a very unique and very fun auction method!

Then comes the tile placement part from the tiles you got in the auction phase and when doing all this you have to take into account the Objective Tiles, the ones that will be scoring at the end of each round, in the game there'll be 4 scoring tiles and each will be scored 3 times during the game... this is also a very cool feature.

In our game group 2 people refuse to play again, a couple folks loved it, most felt like it was unremarkable. Loosing a turn is a big problem in every game I've played:  There are only 5 turns in the game and each turn you can maximally put out 3 tiles.  On a turn, however, you can find yourself unable to buy anyone else's tile and have both of your purchased away - so that you have nothing to do on that turn.  Being down 3 tiles is a ridiculous disadvantage!  It's also not fun.

This is what Carcassonne should have been (then again, Carcassonne was released a lot of years earlier). Also, this makes me wish the rating could go higher... I'm not going to reclick everything else a few degrees lower, but boy, Skye is a gem deserving an 11 at least.
Why?
First of all, having to connect paths in Carcassonne buggered me immensely (it's not an area of one color, merely a line, plus we don't consider a real meadow to be two different meadows just because there's a pathway in the middle) and this game neatly combines a little bit of set collection into the mix, while mitigating luck of the tile draw, because the players can purchase tiles from one another. Might be even a tad short for 2 players, but boy the decisions are agonizing on such simple rules!!!
Also, only using 4 scoring tiles of 16 possible (where the order also matters) makes sure the game is going to be replayable a ton. I had to try several games just to see HOW MUCH is the gameplay and decisions different just because different things are scored this time around. Great job in game design!

A little bit AP-prone game, but as usual, that mainly depends on the gaming group. Killer of: Carcassonne, Mad King Ludwig.
With my constant alternating of two places of residence, this is one of the few games where I didn't regret the money to own it twice.

Recommended: in 2 or 3 players each round draw one "dummy player tile", only one, to be purchasable from the bank for [round number] + 1 coins. Do not redraw it within one round (only one such tile per round, 6 per game), always redraw between rounds (even when not bought).

A tile laying game that has players drawing a set of tiles each turn, and then forcing them to secretly manage the market price for those tiles. In a big reveal, all players can then purchase tiles from one another, or keep what they have (if anything is left!). The rest plays out a bit like Carcassone, with strategic tile placement aimed at maximizing your score through a series of scoring opportunities. Very cool game, with lots of replay value.

I've found this one always gets a positive response from players--it's much fiddlier than Carcassonne but nonetheless it's a nice way to introduce meatier gaming to casual gamers familiar with Carcassonne. (Just as this game would be a good gateway to Keyflower.) -- My major complaint is that while CONCEPTUALLY the game is elegant, PHYSICALLY it's a bit awkward. You need a lot of table space for all the isles to expand, but the result is that everyone sits really far away from each other, and trying to peer at all the tiles up for auction and discern the features on them and the money is very hard. I think in future I will try to rearrange the table so that tiles for auction go in the centre, with some kind of marker to show who put them up for auction. -- That said, the way that money flows easily in this game, and the limit of buying exactly one tile per turn, means that the game is a lot more user-friendly than an auction game like Keyflower--this is a marketplace game rather than an auction game.

This game was for the intended purpose of a light game, relatively short game to play after work. Light set-up and pretty casual. It did meet our purpose, but still does not make it to the table often. It is a cute game that is very easy to teach. I love the different scoring tiles and the general idea for the game. However, it is somewhat dull and unexciting. There are other light-medium games that are easy to hit the table, but more fun. With that said, I still enjoy the game, and it is much better with more people. I do not recommend it for 2 players. Best with 3-4 players.

As chieftan of a Scottish clan, each turn you draw three tiles out of a bag. You have to decide which 2 tiles to auction, and which one to throw away. But if the tiles you auction at the price you set are not bought, you must buy them yourself and put them into your tableau.

Depending on the number of players, there are a number of scoring rounds. Each game, there are 4 things that score (out of 16 possible scoring markers, so each game will be quite different).  Each round will be a combination of the 4 possible, so you want to accumulate tiles towards that end. 

It's a fun game. Comparisons have been made to Carcassone, but I feel it is more strategic, and more interactive. There is a lot going on here, and tryign to price your tiles right for the auction is tough.  You do need to think what tiles other players want, and the price they will pay, and you have to decide if you want to try to keep those tiles yourself.

Decent tile placement thats just a superior version of CoMKL imo.

I think the tile draw and pricing can be a little rough though. Still pretty decent tile placement game

I get why it's been included, but the catch up mechanic kills this for me. The auction system seems to add decisions, but I'm not sure that they are actually more than guesses, given that you'll be playing with several opponents, each of whom has their own agenda and their own tiles to reveal.

Carcassonne tile placement with a cool economic & competitive twist.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The cardboard is thick and the art is by Klemens Franz: practical but not georgeous. An important detail: the scoring tiles are variable and you only use 4 in each game. A standard game would have included 8 of these tiles to ensure variability, 10 at most. Isle of Skye includes 20 scoring tiles.

It's pretty much the base rules of Carcassone with a couple of twists. But what twists! The auction is the core of the game and gives sense to everything else. The powerful valiant catch-up mechanisms, the possibility of destroying one tile, the changing scoring condictions... The game doesn't lose the simplicity of Carcassonne, but it gains so much... I wouldn't say it's much deeper, but you certainly take more important decisions that will define your strategy and the map-building (those things never happened in Carcassonne).

The luck factor has been dampened: you get 3 tiles and choose 2. You can buy your rival's tiles and they can buy yours. There's still luck there (if you get a great tile, you'll either keep it or receive much money), but now it's just a factor more, it's not more important than the rest.

The interaction between players is constant, both in the auction and with the catch-up mechanisms. The auction is a bit tricky and AP prone players should approach it carefully.

My other issue with this game is the catch-up mechanism. I understand its purpose, I know it's imperative because otherwise there will be a perennial problem of runaway leader. But I think it might be too powerful. I need more gaming time to be sure.

Gioco di maggioranze con una simpatica idea di messa all'asta delle proprie tessere. Il gioco parte da un piazzamento tessere in stile Carcassonne e si sviluppa come un gioco di collezione oggetti e maggioranze. Nulla di innovativo ma un titolo che si lascia giocare volentieri.

My initial impressions are very, VERY positive. Isle of Skye has taken a sprinkling of established Euro-mechanics and made them work very effectively together. It's become the norm to criticise games that don't offer anything new, but somehow this one provides enough charm, simplicity and intuitiveness to circumvent the critics. A short play-time, cute art and great scalability complete the package.

It adds some interesting bidding - or actually price setting - mechanic to what is basically Carcassonne, which gives an interestig new layer to it. 
So in the end my only problem is that I'm simply not someone that is very keen on this setting your own price mechanic or auctions etc. in general. So nice game but not really for me, although I don't mind playing when asked.

[b]Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King[/b] was given to Mat.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]While Isle of Skye definitely stood the test of time for me, my family saw otherwise. Unfortunately they did not like the combination of tile laying and having to bid for tiles/manage your income. We didn't play enough for them to get a feel for how to value the tiles and having turns where they didn't have a tile to place left them enjoying the game even less. I ended up giving my copy to a buddy of mine, but haven't had a chance to play since. Isle of Skye is definitely a game I'd enjoy playing more, but it'll have to be with my game group.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Isle of Skye provides a great mash up of tile laying and bidding/$ management. My family compared it to Carcassonne with the addition of having to buy your tiles. Yes the tiles you buy are extremely important to winning, but after a couple of plays you realize how important it is to manage your $ and properly price your tiles. 

There is a lot of player interaction since a tile you really wanted gets bought by another player, you could potentially end up not placing a single tile on your turn and that doesn't feel good. The odds of that happening decrease once you become familiar with how the game works so I don't consider it a negative.

Isle is an excellent choice if you're looking for a game with a great play time to depth ratio. There is a lot of tough decisions to be made in a 45 minute game. The large amount of scoring tiles (of which only 4 are chosen each game) assures plenty of replay. I hope to play this a lot more but the jury is still out for the rest of my family; although they did our second play much more than the first.[/i]

This game is just wonderful.  The price-setting/bidding mechanism works very well, but even better it gives you a world of great choices and ways to score points. Having the scoring schemes change every game is awesome, and even the order of what scores when really matters.  Being able to grab scrolls and get end-game bonus points for me only feels awesome.  The Carcassonne-style terrain tiles are perfect in this game, because you're always thinking about completing regions in addition to completing other scoring objectives.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game.

It has me thinking of Carcassonne:The Discovery being played using the core Key Harvest mechanic of placing tiles out with a cost attached, where someone will either buy it (plus you get your money back), or you get to keep it but you lose your money. You can only score by getting tiles out, so setting the price right to be discouraging and finding bargains elsewhere seems to be the key, but balancing that with maintaining cashflow to keep and buy the tiles you need. I like how the means of scoring points changes from game to game, and varies from round to round which causes valuation fluctuation. Not so much a fan of the time investment required to study each player's board to determine the value of your tiles to each player, and whether your tile is of primary interest at what price to each player - the Mad Ludwig issue. And I suspect most players can't be bothered and do it by feel, which probably leads to some accidental king-making. Leading me to the conclusion that fewer players is probably best so you can find a nice halfway house. But otherwise it's pleasing simplicity provided interesting decisions, it was engaging throughout, and had a nice comfort level due to its similarity in art and game feel to Carcassonne.

This game surpassed my expectations. Meaty and interactive 60-minute tile game. Every player builds their own tableau, manages their money, and vies for earning places in the games various round goals. Much replayablility.  I like the catch-up mechanism, and the theme.

People will compare this to Carc and Glen More. Plays a little faster than Carcassonne and Glen More, but feels very different than them.

Overrated. Bidding on tiles doesn't add much to the game. After a while you don't really care or want to spend the time analyzing your opponent's tiles and what price you should set a tile at. If this is the 'hook' of the game that sets it apart, it did nothing for us. Ends up being another standard tile placement game, nothing special. This designer has good titles like Mombasa amd port royal (much more fun at less than half the price point), but this was a let down for us.

This is a tile placement game, but unlike a lot of these games you each have your own area to place tiles. You get to pull 3 tiles from the bag and then put two for sale and one you put back in the bag. Each player has the option then to buy one tile at the noted prices however any tiles not purchased you must pay the amount you set them at. Using the 4 previously selected scoring tiles, each round you score from 1 to 3 of them so you can plan for the current ones but also since each scores 3 times you can aim to score a lot in all or focus on a few right from the start. A simple game that would be a good introduction but for me it is too simple and I prefer heavier games of this type.

Isle of Skye is a tile-laying game in which players draw a hand of tiles and must price them for both their opponents and themselves.  The opponents get the first crack at tiles in the single buying round, and any unbid tile must be bought by the player who offered it.  There are a number of public goals that are revealed at the beginning of the game, but they activate at the end of different rounds, making their value vary as the game progresses.  There are also a few private goals printed on some tiles.  The pricing and buying mechanic can lead to some analysis paralysis, especially at larger player counts.  On the whole, though, this was enjoyable.

It's like Carcassonne and Palaces of Mad King Ludwig had a baby. Plays significantly better with more than 2, but it's still fine to bring out at a low player count.

Try Jan/17 - very solid 45-60 min game with the full 5 players.  Fun trying to set a price, and to collect different items to help with the scoring.  Very easy for different players to score points in different ways, and the per-round scoring varies greatly from game to game due to the scoring cards - big enough deck; use only 5 per game.
Quick to setup & learn / teach.

Nice mix of Carcassonne with Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  I liked the different scoring paths and attempts to keep your own tiles if you have the funds.  The building was good and the game was easily to follow and not too long.

Lovely game of pricing tiles and building a small island kingdom. A lot going on in the game, as there are 4 goals to be taken into account (all scored in different turns), as well as bonus tiles and tiles generating money. Having a good eye on your opponents is as important as thinking about how your own kingdom should look. Easy to teach though, but very thinky at times, balancing setting the prices for tiles just right and deciding which tiles to buy from your opponents.

Please, don't mention Cracassonne any more when reviewing this game. Both are tile placement games. End of comparison.

Nice tile laying game, having the different scoring tiles in each game really makes the game play out a bit different each time. We only played with 2, and I think that maybe the price setting mechanism would be better with more, as now you're always buying a tile from the other player, and getting the left over one for yourself. 

I've now also played a 4p game, and the price setting mechanism is much more interesting with more players as I expected, and because sometimes all your tiles got bought, and sometimes none of them did, there were also more differences in the points for the different things.

(01/!8)

Designer Alexander Pfister's take on Tile Laying and "Bidding" is a great little puzzle that almost never repeats itself. I think I've never had a game of IoS that felt solved from the beggining, actually, one of my playing friends says he hates it, because he can't figure it out and feels he doesn't know what he's doing.

I feel like this game is about letting go of a plan, and just go with what you have and adapt. 

The bidding mechanic is so tense... "am I putting too much money on this tile? or maybe too little so they'll buy it, maybe it is too little... nooo, too much"

and the nothing turns out the way you want it, but you have to keep going.

I almost always want to play it. It is easy to teach to people that have played Carcassone.

This game isn't a thinker, but it is not light, there's so much silence on the table with this game, but it never feels tiring.

Got to play this game at this month's local board game meetup. 

It is essentially a tile laying game but with an buying mechanism that reminds me of Castles of Mad King Ludwig. You get randomized scoring conditions and you try to work the best to your ability to score the most points. 

After 2 rounds of buying how to set up price becomes very cloudy since you have to consider both your own and all your opponent's board to set the price and sometimes I wonder if money (1 pt per $5 at end of game) is really necessary in this game. But without setting prices for tiles and buying with money this game seems so rudimentary. Money doesn't feel tight in this game compared to CoMKL or other Euros but maybe it is because I've played a 3-player game?

I need to work on my spatial brain power though. I sucked at my first play through.

After Cornwall the second game with tile placement that I actually enjoy. If this continues, tile placement will become my favourite gaming mechanism :-) But here it's off course because the fun is setting the prices and trying to guess which tile has which value for the others.

A Carcassonne with a very good auction mechanic. It´s a very good game with lots of replayability, because the scoring tiles change from game to game, each one creates it´s own kingdom arround it´s castle, and the most profit kingdom wins. It´s different from Carcassonne but it does not replace it, because I like them both, they have their own special caracteristics, and I will continue to play them.

While very Carcassonne looking, plays very differently. Everyone is building their own territory while auctioning off pieces and acquiring new ones. The different scoring tiles and the order in which they are scored provide an immense amount of replay value to this title. I would certainly play again.

I have a lot of amazing things to say about this game. I love it! It hits all the right buttons for me. Tile laying, fast, easy to teach, auctions, personal player building. It is basically like this game was designed to please me. Amazing game, Highly recommended for anyone. Simply one of the best and will be a go to game for me for a while. Probably replaces Cities- just because no one plays Cities with me. Both are equally awesome.

Easy, quick, wonderful.

Draw random tiles, put them up for sale. Set the price.
If others buy them from you, you get the money but lose the tile. If they don't, you get the tile but lose the money. Delicious decisions.

Scoring is different every game. You can set yourself up for a good score by creating opportunities for tiles to be worth much more to you than to your opponents, so you can get them (for cheap).

What I like most is that it has a solo puzzle element - when you're agonizing over the decision how much money to place on your tiles and how much to keep for purchasing - but the game is still almost 100% player interaction: everything the others do is important to you. And the solo bit you do simultaneously, so the game doesn't drag.

Also impressive is that the game gives a huge bonus to players that are behind, and it doesn't unbalance the game. Even if they have 40 cash to spend and you have 5, you're still playing the same game. Trying to keep your lead with limited options is a fun challenge, as is making use of all your bonus wealth to catch up to the leaders.

Different combinations of scoring elements each game - from placing your tiles in squares to creating the largest lake possible to simply getting as many sheep as you can - means the game is different each time.

Skye reminds me somewhat of Ra. Valuate the tiles, from your own position and those of your opponents, and increase your score while strengthening your relative position at the table.

It's been some time since I found a new '10' game. Skye is exactly what I was looking for.

Bit of an information overload during the auction rounds. 3 x [number of players] tiles to evaluate. Also don't like the general flow of money in this game, especially with the catchup mechanic which is way too overtuned. Have only played at 5, but I've heard it's better with fewer, and fewer players would address both of my concerns in some way so I believe that.

Cute tile-laying Euro game (it can be *SO* silent around the table) which is prone to optimization players running away with it. The vendor scheme (even if borrowed from elsewhere) works well. Players can get screwed by selling both tiles, as the money is rarely enough compensation.

+Tile laying (a la Carc) with clever bidding on tile purchases. Random round scoring (goals), tile specific scoring, and player order penalty/bonus keeps strategic and tactical planning tense and tremendously variable. 
-Deep decision making, can be AP prone. The game doesn't quite have the tile laying charm I expected. The key decisions seem to revolve around how to price the tiles and what to buy. Not as much a gateway as others seem to regard it. The balance of the came can suffer greatly if one of the players fails to grasp how point scoring and maximization is realized for a particular setup.
I think other reviews have exaggerated the impact of the catch up mechanism (and their criticism for its presence in this game). While I generally approve of catch-up mechanics, a few extra coins equates to a minor victory point bump, and most players who can't appropriately price tiles aren't served well by a few more coins.

While many consider this to be a medium-light family game accessible and satisfying to both casual and strategic gamers, I consider the weight to be considerably higher. The depth of decisions regarding long/short term goals (round scoring, tile placement, tile pricing, tile axing, evaluating vp value of each tile respective of when it becomes available, evaluating vp value of tiles relative to different players), analyzing other player's needs/goals, adaptive strategies (bonus scoring scroll tiles), and money management make this game packed with decisions. I think experience and analytical players will be able to approach mastery of game mechanics and create large scoring disparities (as our sessions have indicated).
I worry our group will find it a bit too dense have long-term repeated play.

This is a tile laying game, where each round, each player gets three tiles. They select one of the tiles to be removed from the game, and set the buy price of the other two. Then in turn order, each player has the opportunity to buy one tile from any other player, paying them the cost of the tile. At the end of the buy phase, any tiles not bought, you pay for yourself to the bank, and add all the tiles to your little personal tableau, following the placement rules of land types on the edges of the tiles need to match up. Then there's a scoring. The scoring criteria are different every game, which gives the game a ton of replayability. This game really is fantastic. It's short, meaty and has a ton of player interaction.

Carcassonne with an auction mechanic...which is actually a lot more fun than it sounds.  It does kind of become an exercise in min/maxing and AP can become a problem, but overall, it plays fairly quickly, and the rules are organic and intuitive.  The variable scoring is inspired, and will certainly extend the play life of the game.  The components are pretty typically Mayfair: higher quality, solid art, but built for use more than looking gorgeous on the table.  Overall, a pretty great game value, and a nice spin on a classic.

RATING: 5
Take the classic elegance of Carcassonne and add complex tile graphics with mean-spirited 'take that' poaching and you have a game that just isn't fun. The myriad of symbols are too small and are only of significance for a subset of the potential scoring options. The disparity in scoring points withing and between the differing options are too extreme and the 'catch up' mechanic is often of much greater value than the income from the tile display. The varied scoring selections give it about 100 (1000?) times as much replayability as it actually will be replayed. It can be played, just not for me (my interest is about a 3).

Quick, easy-to-learn game. Provides a similar feel as Carcassonne mixed with Castles of Mad King Ludwig. Auction mechanism is similar to the master builder in CoMKL. The variable round scoring system will provide replayability. Tight and solid game. Not sure if the catch-up mechanic is overpowered. Will need to try playing with more than 2 players. For some reason, just not itching to play this more than CoMKL or Carcassonne.

I think the variable scoring tiles are just really great, it really creates such different goals for what tiles you want each game. The setting of prices for tiles and the purchasing are also just really smart mechanics. After more plays, this game continues to grow on me and I have updated this to an 8. 

Update: After even more plays I upped this to a 9 for now. I continue to want to play this and think about it and try out different things within the game.

July 2015: I spent 11 hours demo'ing this at the Mayfair vendor area at GENCON. I sat down on Friday to learn it and Garret and I spent the rest of the day teaching others. The 'poor Game Shepard' in the area was overwhelmed and no one was going to do it. I returned on Saturday and Sunday for a few more hours.

It is a sold game. It is lighter than Keyflower but shares a similar feeling - which I like. Table talk makes the game better... most any auction is improved with table talk in my opinion.

Dec 2015: My BGG Secret Santa got this for me. I hadn't saved and ordered it even though I wanted it. I'm extremely happy. We played it at High Tide the following Monday and I think I sold another copy.

July 2016: Great gaming moment - I was cutting edge on this Spiel winner.

Even though I am not a big fan of players having their own playing areas (think Agricola, Puerto Rico etc.), this one works quite well and I like the randomised winning conditions. I reckon that with more plays you get more used to actually checking out the other players' "islands".

RATING: N/A
Pros:
* The auction mechanism works perfectly with 2p
* Quick setup / cleanup
* Fun!
* Mathy puzzles to solve while to price and place tiles
* Great art work and good quality components.

Cons:
* Apparently it's pretty common, in a 2p game, for luck-of-the-tile-draw to screw one player.
* Lots of little calculations and if you want to really get an idea how much you should value a tile, you need to carefully look around at all of the other boards.
* Could be AP prone

Neutral:
* I generally dislike games with player screens, but as a method to hide you choices rather than your resources, I think it worked well. Reminds me of Fresco where you decide what you're going to do and then do a big reveal.

= 2015-10-22

Some comments after a single 2p game. My first play involved two scoring tiles that gave points for having groupings including light houses. I acquired two lighthouses early in the game and then no other opportunities ever came up for my opponent to acquire one (a few more lighthouse tiles came up, but always on my side and I just axed them). After a very lopsided game, we looked over the list of tiles and figured those may be two of the worst tiles in the game for 2p and we ended up with both of them.

But the important thing to take away from this is that we both still very much enjoyed the game. As frustrating as it was for F to be have absolutely no way to get a lighthouse and as anticlimactic the final turn (the last tiles were so boring, I put one up for sale for a single coin and it didn't get purchased), we still had a lot of fun. There's a game here and it's much more than just getting the most points. It's fun.

I was worried that it would be hard to value the tiles and it would require a few plays to really get an idea what they're worth, but even if we mis-priced a few things here and there, it didn't feel like anyone got a steal of a deal. Either you get a tile or you get some money; either way, this isn't one of those annoying blind auction games that leaves you feeling cheated by lady luck (at least not for the auction part).

No rating yet as I don't think my first play was very typical.

RATING: 10
Pros:
1. Decision Points. This game requires the tough decision of how to price your tiles, how much do you keep back to buy other tiles, and which tile do you axe. It's such a simple mechanic that requires some hard decision making.
2. Variability. There are many different scoring tiles that will change every game. This changes the feel of the game every time you play.
3. Quick to Play. When everyone knows the rule, a 4 player game is less than 40 minutes.
4. Easy to Teach. The game takes approximately 10 minutes to teach.

Cons:
1. Catch Up Mechanic. The catch up mechanic is simply giving out gold to those who are further behind. When the scores are close, the same amount of gold is given out even if they're further apart. This catch up mechanic has caused massive swings in the final round.


Summary: This is an amazing game. The variability and tough decision points keep this game fresh. This game works for heavy euro players, new gamers and families. The versatility makes this game a must have in my collection.

Comparisons to Carcasonne and power grid were overheard as I learned it, and in some ways that is true.

Wow, just wow - that's how you make a great gateway eurogame! For me, this game shows how bland and boring are designs like the hugely overrated (at least from my perspective) "Splendor".

"Isle of Skye" has everything a gateway needs. Rules? Three minutes of explanation. Setup time? Almost non-existant. Ease of play? Certainly. Add to that no downtime and what you get is one of the best Spiel des Jares contender in recent years. This game offers tons of replayability and considerable depth, if you factor in how easy and simple it is. It plays fast, has interesting interaction in the very clever "auction" mechanic. No turn feels unimportant, you'll be engaged from the beginning till the very end. Bought it, unpacked, and played 8 times in a row. And that says something!

Definitely a keeper, will be my go-to gateway game next to titles like TtR and "Kingdom Builder".

Doesn't differentiate itself enough from other tile laying games, and the few unique aspects were underwhelming. Not a big fan of the flow of money in the game.

They keep each game somewhat fresh, at least.

Great game.  Instant classic.

It's a lot of game packed into a short time frame.  It's less a tile laying game and more a bidding game....but not really bidding, you just set pricing 'correctly.'

There are 4 scoring objectives which change every game (so replay-ability is high) + you can get tiles with end game scoring objectives.

The mechanic of a randomly draw 3 and then you kill one of the three tiles is nice.

I played this once, with four other players.

It's quite quick and a clever, streamlined design. Fun mechanisms such as 'push-your-luck' etc are baked-into the simple actions. It will reward smart play.

However, this game also takes things to an extreme regarding making you squint across the table to constantly add-up what combinations of icons your opponents have on their (evolving) tableaus of cards. The entire game is built around that, as your actions are all about selling to them what they need. Unfortunately this means about 20% of the game is actual tactics/strategy and 80% is a web of simple math, which puts me off. May the top squinter/adder win!

If I did score it, it might be a 6/10. That's 8/10 for slick design but two points deducted for that problematic game format.

Very  good tile laying game. However, the tile laying itself is not as central as in Carcassonne (in which you try to get into other people's scoring areas or avoid that others do that to you by good placement of the tiles), but rather the auctions. This game is about assessing, how much a tile is worth to you and to others. It is about pricing and not about tile laying. Hence, I would rather compare it to auction games like Ra. It still plays very quick and is explained rather  fast, for quite a deep game. My biggest positive surprise for 2015.

This is a strange combo of Carcassonne with a bidding feel of Revolution.  But what makes this unique is that the blind bidding has multiple layers.  You not only bid to maybe keep a tile but you also set a price for other to buy.  On top of that you also get to get rid of a tile completely.  If this is enough to wrap your head around but you then must use these tile to score victory points based on different criteria each round. The rules are super streamlined but the game is very deep and satisfying.  The victory tiles change each game and there are a tons of them so no two games really play out the same.   One of my favorite games of 2015.

Took no time to learn. Not legendary by any means, but it uses incredibly familiar game elements very effectively. I wish it had any other theme though - the theme and art are perfectly serviceable but just SO BORING. I would like to play this same game but build a space colony. Or a daycare. Or a hermit crab habitat. Basically anything except "historical countryside".

I finally got to play this game. There is so much struggle with trying to balance the bidding. Putting enough value on the tiles you want to keep so my opponent doesn't take it, while holding back enough coins to possibly buy a tile they might have under valued. There isn't too much to the tile placement, not that it doesn't matter. It just seemed to be fairly straight forward. The part I liked the most is the scoring mechanic. There are 5 scoring tiles that score for different things. However, they are scored in different combinations throughout the game in the different rounds. So cool! I'm excited to see what the expansion, Isle of Skye: Journeyman, adds to the experience. I also think that playing with more than 2 players will give a much different feel. I liked it a lot, but didn't love it like I thought I would. Maybe a more interesting scoring tile combination will really spark my interest even more.

Excelete mecânica, que não é bem de leilão, é mais de precificação, em que você tem que avaliar quanto vale cada uma das suas peças e também quanto dinheiro você quer ter disponível na rodada.

A parte de tile-laying é legal também, mas o gênio do jogo está nessa ideia simples e que funciona muito bem.

Played this with 2 players and quite honestly I could not play this with more than two. It just burns my brain, I kept needing to pick up my opponent's tiles and placing them in my territory to see if they would work or not before deciding if I wanted to buy them. Then I would do that with my own tiles. 

And some of the scoring felt fiddly to me, for example counting all the animals that are adjacent to farms (and diagonal) and then counting the animals again that were actually on a farm. Some of the scoring felt a bit tedious.

You need to slow down and pay attention during the buy phase. It's easy to accidentally take money that you should have paid the bank and vice versa because you are buying tiles and keeping tiles that no one else bought but on those you pay the money you put on them to the bank. It's not hard but it's easy to get confused if you're talking or whatever. Again, just has a fiddly feel to it.

This game is okay and it's not broken or anything, but I found it to be a bit dull. Felt like a KS. As far as tile laying games go I am much happier with Carc.

This is a nice light tile-laying game with an interesting auction mechanic.  We liked it, but the game didn't feel particularly fun to us.  It is definitely better with 4 players than with 2, but even at 4 players it is just not as much fun as we were hoping.  We played it with our 4 year old, who loved it, but couldn't possible wrap his head around the goal-oriented scoring and auctioning.  It was too simple and uninteresting for us and too complex for our kids, so we traded it away for a game that we can all enjoy together - Takenoko.

RATING: 7
Very good, price-setting game.  I much prefer the way this mechanic is used here than in Mad King Ludwig, since it's simultaneous and less AP-prone.  Secret price setting and then turn-based buying is much faster and actually more interesting than open auctions - it should be used more often.  The way each game will have a different combination of scoring goals adds some additional replay value, although I think most of the fun is in how much players choose to be generous or stingy in their pricing and how that evolves as they get more experienced.

Update: Still really enjoy the price-setting.  We had the 5 or 2 points for 1st/2nd most money goal, which adds a lot to your price-setting and purchasing decisions.  The scoring system of having different goals a la Suburbia is great - the timing system of when they score is just meh.  Apart from not caring about the A goal on the last round tile choices, it's not relevant.  However, I find this is another example of taking a great mechanic and then half-assing a game to use that mechanic.  I just want there to be something more thematic, more interesting, more interactive, in what's going on with the tiles.  

My idea is if we were architects designing buildings - if no one purchases and builds your designs, you have to build them yourself, and all the purchased tiles are added to a single growing city in the middle of the table, with personal tokens placed on them to indicate ownership.  What the buildings are and where/when they are placed provides income, points, and special abilities.

Preliminary (one-play) rating may go up with more plays. Played a 4 player game and my wife and I really enjoyed it. Simple but clever. Moves along fairly briskly and has very nice components.
We didn't realize that gold was supposed to be secret but, in practice, it didn't matter a bunch mainly because the 5/2 gold scoring tile was in play.

Looks amazing.


My second favorite game of 2015 so far. This is a masterful design. The bidding system is so clever, and it takes tile laying to a new chamber of fun. My second favorite tile laying game after Glen More, wish Glen had the same component quality though. Plays good with 2 but this one shines with 3+. Two player felt less tense, and the design definitely elevates when there's a wider variety of options to purchase. The 3 player game was absolutely brilliant, tense, and so much fun. And I suspect it's even better with 4, man, this game is incredible. Looking forward to many more plays.

Traded for a game that's higher on my wishlist so off it went.

Good light bidding game that's easy to explain and quick to play. The auction system from Key Harvest has always appealed to me. This was on my wish list on that basis alone. Add that it's by the designer of Port Royal and I my interest was definitely piqued.

The flow of money with this auction system is interesting. Sometimes it's better to forego an expensive purchase to leave your opponents short of cash. So pricing is an interesting calculation and risk based upon tiles not yet pulled from the bag.

The game is hindered slightly by the simple turn order determination - start player moves to the player on the left. Turn order is very important for your cashflow. As players cotton on to this they start to factor this in and starve the last buying player of funds by not buying from them. Well, it's not super important, but especially early in the game, as funds are scarce, it seems like a bit of a random element decided by the luck of your seating position.

Of course it doesn't work so well with only two players, but from 3-5 it's interesting without being brain burning. Along with Cacao from 2015 it's been a welcome addition to my light games shelf.

Isle of Skye is what Carcassonne should have been with a dash of Castles of Mad King Ludwig for good measure. The way you set prices for your tiles works nicely, and the economy scales better than in Castles of Mad King Ludwig. Overall I would rather play Ludwig with 4 experienced players that don't suffer from AP, but Isle of Skye is a more flexible game that works well in a wider variety of circumstances; It is easier to teach, plays faster, and works well at different player counts. Isle of Skye is a little bit less interesting with 2, but still works fine and is enjoyable at that player count. The variability in the tiles that come out and the variable scoring make the game incredibly replayable.

This just jumped past a lot of other great games on my list after just one play with suggested first game point scoring.

Kids loved it. Beautiful to look at! Table talk during bidding with some ..... no buy that not mine because of this conniving went on.

Maybe a bit like Vault wars which I also picked up at Gen Con and had a blast with.

Egy brutális Carcassonne másolat az Isle of Skye, ami a nagy elődöt azzal bonyolítja meg, hogy különböző körökben különböző előre számolható dolgokat pontoz a játékos tablóján, illetve a licitálásos rész az érdekessége. Véletlenszerűen húzott lapkáinkat beárazzuk a paravánunk mögött, majd licitre bocsátjuk. Amit nem vesznek meg, illetve, amit mi megveszünk azokat építhetjük le, így szélsőséges esetben előfordulhat, hogy adott körben nem tudunk építeni, ha lapjainkat megveszik, nekünk pedig nincs elegendő pénzünk vásárolni a többiektől, de sokat jelenthet már csak egy lapkával kevesebb építés is a többiekhez képest. Így az árazás jó kiszámítása a játék kulcsa. A dizájn szebb, mint a Carcában és kicsit érdekesebb a játék, de a szerencse talán még erősebb. Nálam egy szint a két játék.

RATING: 5
I felt like the tile buying mechanism creates an illusion of players interactions in a mostly solitaire game. Most of the time, I'm just looking at my own tiles and assign $ to each tile based on how important they are to my current board. There's no way I would have the time to look at each of my opponent's board and account for which tiles I should buy from them to screw them over. I also do not have the time to look at everyone's board and see which of my tiles are important to an opponent (and react by placing more $ on my own tiles). Ultimately, what my opponents do, while could potentially affect my game, is not something I can influence.

In the end I think luck plays a major factor in this game and winning the game didn't feel fulfilling. As a filler game, I think it's longer than it needs to be.

So this is just a great combination of some of my favorite mechanics in a pretty fast-playing package. You've got auctions with a closed economy, which is super sweet, random endgame victory point goals so each game is different, and then tile placement to have some fun solving some interesting spacial orientation problems. The tiles are also pretty for a nice added bonus.

Isle of Skye is a tableau building game at its core.  There are elements of Carcassonne in that placement rules are visual, but tiles are auctioned off in fixed price auctions and players build their tableaus individually.  Variable scoring conditions in each game drive the decisions.  In this way the game is reminiscent of Kingdom Builder.  With a 45 minute playing time, it's hard to dislike Isle of Skye, but it's also hard to love it.

1 play, 4er

Interesting tile-laying set-collection game with variable point scoring. You start the game poor but can fairly quickly build up a pile of cash -- and set prices accordingly higher and higher. You have to acquire tiles to score them, of course, so you have to price yours high enough that they both aren't consistently bought out from under you every turn! I have a hard time with that part, although I still had fun with the game.

To set up, 4 scoring tiles are randomly selected each game from a large pool. Each of these will score thrice over the course of the 6 rounds each game. Tiles have a variety of features (landscape types, roads, building/animal/other icons). Players start with a home tile. Each round, players first collect income (5 + 1 per connected whisky icon). Then, they simultaneously (and secretly) draw 3 random tiles: discard one, set a price (using your own coins) on the other two -- all relieved simultaneously. Then, in player order, either buy a tile from someone ELSE (they get your coins, and the coins they used to set the price) or pass. Then, add your purchased tiles (including any you put up that went unsold -- you buy them at cost) to your tableau. End the round by scoring the 1-3 types of scoring indicated for the current round. 

After 6 rounds, everyone also scores:
- 1VP per 5coins
- any VP indicated on the tiles in their tableau (by scrolls; these are doubled if the scroll is in a terrain that is completely enclosed). 
Most VP wins.

Take note Carcassone fans!  This is a well designed tile-laying, map-building game.  I hate Carcassone.  I think it is a terrible, poorly designed game and can't for the life of me understand the universal love for it and consideration as a great, classic game.  Anyway, this is a game about drawing tiles from a bag and building a map, completing landscape types for points.  But this one I enjoyed quite a bit.

So each turn players draw three tiles from a bag, one of them is "axed" and sent back to the bag, the other two you place money on.  This sets both the price for other players as well as the price you will pay for the tile yourself if no other player purchases it.  This is very weird and makes no sense thematically/logically (in fact I was convinced we made a mistake with the rule because it makes so little sense) but mechanically this is a very interesting way to handle auctions.  Once the tile auction phase is finished you put the tiles into your personal map.  Terrain types need to match (except roads) and you score points based on universal goals as well as bonuses on many of the tiles.

I think my one complaint which happens a lot with many games with universal goals is that they aren't all created equal.  We had one goal in our game that earned players 10-12 points a turn while the others were only granting 5-6.  This makes it so there are certain goals you need to aim for and so things like luck of the draw and turn order can give players somewhat unfair advantages.  Because of the auction phase and number of options this isn't too bad though.

Other than that I really enjoyed the game and the level of variety and replayability it appears to offer.  It looks nice and colorful and it also plays really quickly (without too terribly AP players, that is).

This is an auction tile laying game to build a kingdom/village. In each game, four scoring tiles will be selected (out of 20?) and in each round only some of these four scoring tiles will be in effect. This makes the game highly replayable. Overall, I like this better than Carcassonne even though it is only slightly more complicated due to the tile auction.

Can´t really say much about this game as I've only played it 2 players which I guess it's not how it shines. Nice mechanics in a simple to learn game. I found the tile laying a bit difficult to execute (probably only in my head but I guess I don't excel at abstraction) and so my guess is that it will bring some (or a lot) of AP when playing with more players. If for one hand it should be better with more than 2 players, my feeling is that it could be too much to deal with if with 5, for example, or even 4. But I want to give it a second try and see if it works. It let me curious.

Played it again with 3 players. It's much better and it's also a new challenge. I really like the simplicity of the design and also the baldness of mixing all of the scoring tiles and place them randomly making the first and second scorings, sometimes, residual or even inexistent. One of the good games of this year.

There is no denying that Carcassonne has been one of the most influential games of modern board gaming. Isle of Skye, on the other hand, is said to follow up on the same ideas, only adding a few elements (such as an auction phase) to make for  deeper element.

As such, Isle of Skye is still an easy to teach and learn game, but it is deep enough to make for an interesting experience. Also, it can be played in less than one hour. It's decent. Nothing more, nothing less.

Sadly, I am somewhat disappointed about the art work. Klemens Franz is one of my absolute favorite board game artists, but this time it looks like he didn't take his time to do the job as thoroughly as we are used to.

A tile laying game, each player has their own clan territory that they can expand by buying tiles from opponents, or paying the bank for each tile their opponents didn't purchase from their supply.  The auction mechanic allows for interesting strategies that makes this game more interactive than Carcassonne, especially when the scoring mechanisms will be randomly drawn before each game, and will change each turn, allowing for different focus and advance planning while the game progresses.  The game is not too complex to be easily understood, and emergent strategy quickly becomes apparent to new players, while still providing depth of gameplay.

I enjoy the two-part puzzle here; which cards do you draft and how do you arrange them to maximize your scoring potential? The open information about which scoring tiles are going to score each round affords lots of room for planning. The income catch-up mechanic can feel pretty punishing when you're in the lead, but it doesn't seem to actually change the winner in most games. It definitely keeps the leader on his or her toes, however.

If this were a longer game the auction and the income catch-up mechanic might bother me, but this one plays very quickly while still delivering a satisfying challenge and a nice creative puzzle. I'm a fan.

RATING: 4
Carcassonne crossed with something like the offering from Key Harvest: draw tiles and set prices; take the payment from the bank if someone else buys or pay your price to the bank and place it yourself.

For most of the game it's basically impossible to determine whether a given tile will actually pay off, so the early game choices of money-producing tiles / end-game scoring to steer strategy are more interesting. Heavy-handed catchup mechanism rather distorts the late-game market.

Worth a look if you're after Carc++, though the individual tableaus mean significantly less interaction.

[Mayfair 2015 edition] {Scotland; auction, tile-laying, set-collection; optimal 4p} Isle of Skye is a great family game.  Fun, interactive and of high replayability with thematic illustration.  It is suitable for children too.  The mechanism to select 2 tiles each round is interesting. You buy one tile from other player, keep one yourself and discard another.  If allows some planning and mitigation on luck of draw.  And this mechanic makes the game interesting and engaging.

There is a fine balance between randomness and luck even though there are multiple kinds of tiles to control.

The game is easy to be taught, with the help of player aid.  And it is easy to set up.

The game components are great: colorful and practical.  I wish the coins are better.

Friend of mine brought his copy to the gaming table. It is kind of a fun diversion, but I found out, like I did when Carcassonne so many years ago, that tile-laying games simply do not hold my attention. The price setting is nice, but too fiddly because of the too small player boards provided. The availability of what's up is a random draw, the availability of what does not get axed is out of your control. You are left with only setting your own price and after that the game basically runs itself. You either maximise your own score or try to hamper a runaway leader. And in a 4p game, the smart choice is always the maximisation.

I tried to go for long-term strategy, maximizing the end-game bonuses and grabbing a surprise win, and found out the hard way that

a) you don't have to include these bonuses in the area you like to score
b) it doesn't matter anyway as they are just tie-breakers to a victory: the experienced player (the friend bringing the copy) immediately grasped the superior scoring mechanism drawn up and gobbled up the good tiles for it. After that, the game was dead.

Don't see this hitting our table very often again, and don't mind it not doing so.

tl;dr: Carcassonne with a bidding mechanism and no meeples

It's a tile laying game, so of course you will see comparisons with the most popular title in the genre, but it is quite similar in many ways. You also have multiple elements and landscape types for which you can score and the tiles look quite similar. But you don't need meeples to score anything. And you don't just draw and place, but you auction tiles (for a set price). And most of all: you all build your own tableau. So it is not Carcassonne, but it does feel like it in many respects.
Anyway, different enough and very solid.

Isle of Skye is perfectly fine, but deeply unexciting and the need to work out the value of each tile to each other player means that the lightness of the game doesn't match the amount of studying needed to play competitively.

It has nice levels of replayability, but just doesn't work for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game, and although important decisions have to be made (what price to sell your tiles for, and which tile to buy from an opponent, and figuring out the optimal placement of the tile), it plays quick enough to get a few games done on one game night.

It is true that while you can never be sure to get the tile(s) you want, some countermeasures can be taken to get profit in as much possible ways as you can.
It may be more profitable to maximize a scroll scoring on items not available on the scoring tiles after all... This may also counter a bit the randomness of the tile drawing.

We also try to convince other players why not to buy your tile, but instead one of the opponents... Having all your tiles bought by opponents leaves you with an awkward feeling you want to avoid.

The only negative point is that from across the table it is nearly impossible to see the details on the tiles of your opponents. But we simply ask if we need more info.

Amazing!
"Kingdom Builder" done right with some borrowed ideas from "Carcassonne".
The auctioning is not everybody's thing, but building a gorgeous little kingdom is great.
And the variable scoring is executed masterfully in this game which leads to huge replayability.

in short:
+ nice Scotland theme (It fits amazingly even though the game is quite abstract.)
+ tiles and building a gorgeous kingdom(!)
+ masterful variable scoring
+ good materials and artwork
- auctioning is not that popular and has its problems
- a bit of runaway leader problem despite the strong catch-up mechanism
- not much player interaction ?


I really like this game because of the theme, the tiles and the variable scoring. But a few things seem off. It's easy to make mistakes while pricing and buying, which often leads to runaway leader. And the hefty catch-up mechanism doesn't help that much.

It might be better to not fully randomize the scoring tiles. Not all work in every place and I'd prefer a good mix of different types (animals/ships, buildings, terrain, tile geometry).

Solid gameplay. It's a slightly beefed up Carcasonne, but with a player-determined economy bolted on. Instead of simply getting a random tile to add to a communal board, you price and then purchase tiles to add to your individual board. I like how there is natural inflation in the game. I also like how you are forced to purchase tiles you overprice (or tiles you really want and therefore purposefully "overprice" -- sort of a blind auction). In fact, I pretty much like everything about the pricing scheme.

The tile-laying and point-scoring system, however, is merely okay. There's nothing wrong with it, but the shifting score conditions are a bit much in my opinion. You can plan ahead, but it gets fiddly. It feels more like the game is searching for a narrative arc than adding a lot of strategic decisions.

That said, I'd certainly play again.

I enjoyed Isle of Sky. The problem is, it reminds me very much of 20th Century, another tile-laying game with road connections that generate resources, and I think I like 20th Century more. Isle of Skye is lighter, however, so perhaps it will carve out its own niche. I am interested to use its auctions system more - it raises some fascinating questions about whether you're pricing your tiles to sell or pricing them in hopes of keeping them. Update: Given how quickly this plays in comparison with 20 Century, I do think this has a place in my collection along with its more complex cousin. One quibble grounded on nothing but personal taste: I like the goals/bonus points everyone can achieve far better than the ones that give points only for the first and second place finishers, which can really snowball, cause runaway leaders and skew scores in what is otherwise typically a tight game.

Reminded me of Carcassonne while the rules were being explained, but it reminded me more of Alhambra merged with a Knizia-esque auction phase while playing.  And with Feld-ish "points salad" scoring.

I liked the auction phase but felt the tile laying phase was way too easy.  Maybe because roads don't need to be connected, maybe because the points salad means that pretty much any tile will have some scoring value, or maybe because you have your own tableau so other players can't mess with what you're doing.

I'd be surprised if this game has much longevity in gaming circles.  (Though I do like that a lot of the scoring depends on random tile draws, which would at least differentiate each session and prevent the game from being solved.)

It's got the same problem as any other game where you set the prices and bid on tiles. Which is that you have a hard time estimating the value of the included tiles during a first/ the first game(s). Other than that Isle of Skye plays pretty smooth

Really like this after one play, and so far this is one of the best game I've played in 2015. There are a couple of things I really like.

First is the scoring tiles. There are 16 scoring tiles, you mix them up and only use four per game. Also, the order in which the tiles are placed makes the game play out differently (different combinations of the four tiles will score at different times during the game). This makes for a ton of replayability and it reminds me of the way scoring goals are handled in Kingdom Builder (although this is a much better game than Kingdom Builder).

The second thing is the price setting mechanic. This game doesn't actually have bidding or auctions in the traditional sense. You put up a screen and secretly set the price for two tiles that you have in front of you. Then everyone removes their screens and starting with the first player each person can buy one tile from an opponent. If no one buys one of your tiles, you get to keep it but you essentially have to pay the price that you set. This makes for an interesting use of money management. You can set a crazy high price for your own tiles if you want to keep them, but then you won't have much money for the next round. And when setting your prices, you lose that money temporarily while waiting for someone to buy one of your tiles. So when setting your prices you want to also try to have enough money leftover in order to buy other tiles. Really interesting idea and it takes a couple of rounds to get the hang of pricing your tiles properly.

The only real issue I can see is that this wouldn't be good for two players (unless there is a two-player variant built in - I played someone else's copy so I'm not familiar with the rulebook). With two players there just wouldn't be enough tiles to be competitive, and it would be entirely possible for no good tiles to come out based on the scoring options for a given game. The game seems like it will be best with 4-5 (I played with 5).

Good game, rating could likely increase after more plays.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3+[/b]
You need more players just to have more tiles in the game. With two, bad tile draws could result in a pretty uneven game.

The A/B/C/D/E scoring is neat at first glance until you realize it doesn't make the gameplay fun at all, and it's so anti-competitive that they needed to tack on a dumb "get coins if you're behind" mechanic. Awful! Tile placement is mildly satisfying but the game doesn't even last long enough to make the map interesting at the end. And lastly, the art isn't even that good (and I like Scottish tribesmen as a game theme idea!) Had potential, but thumbs down for me.

A tile laying game with an auction mechanic. I like how the player can set the price of their drawn tile then have the chance to buy tiles from others. Scoring takes place at the end of the round depending on the item on the marker.

This is a great gateway game and can be played within the hour!

Isle of Skye is the surprise hit of 2016 for me. I first played it at SaltCON in March. Before that, I had only seen it mentioned a few times on BGG, and didn't care to try it because I wasn't drawn in by another light tile-laying game. What I always disliked about Carcassonne, was that the driving mechanism in the game was a random tile draw. I felt like there could always have been a better game designed around the way the tiles lay out on the table. So, when I learned the rules to this, I was immediately smitten. The brilliance of Isle of Skye is the way it uses simple rules, but creates a complex, highly-interactive economic system for how players acquire their tiles from round to round. This is a great game for newbies and geeks alike. Highly recommended for both.

A perfect filler game by my standards. Once you know the game it plays very quickly and is quite enjoyable.  I love the changing scoring conditions and it really drives how you go about the game.

It's not often that I say a game is best with 2 players as I like to see the board change usually. However this game like Innovation in my opinion seems to absolutely work best with two.  It's just easier to keep up with the other players domain and what you suspect they will buy and therefore be able to price better. As you are each working your own thing you are not looking for the board state to change so my issue there is resolved.

This is Carcassonne for game players. It has a very nice auction/buy system , and variable victory conditions. But it needs quite a bit of attention to figure out how to price your tiles depending on what the other players need. It plays poorly with 5 players.

RATING: 6.5
Isle of Skye is a quick tile laying game. Every round (there are only six) you get some income, then draw three tiles. One of those tiles you'll discard. The other two you'll price by putting some of your coins next to them indicating the cost. Then, in turn order every player gets to buy a single tile from someone else. They pay you the price you set and you take their coins and the coins you put next to that tile. After everyone has purchased a single tile (or chosen not to), you have to buy any tiles in front of you that weren't bought, by giving up the coins you set next to them. Then everyone places their tiles in their tableau.

Every game will have 4 different random goals that reward for completing certain configurations of tiles, or for various features on those tiles. Not every goal will be scored every round though. Each goal will be scored three times during the game, but the order of scoring varies (which is preset and known at the game outset).

Pricing tiles correctly is hugely important. If you try to price tiles expensively, you may not be able to buy anyone else's tiles... and other people may let you have your expensive tiles, which will bankrupt you for next turn. But price them too low and you'll give away points. You can be screwed and end up with no tiles to place, if you couldn't afford to buy a tile and everyone bought the tiles you had to offer, but you'll be set up for the following round with a lot of cash.

The game is fairly straightforward, and there's nothing truly revolutionary here, but it's quick and fun.

About [thing=176494][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=176494][/thing] is a tile-laying game mixed with buying and selling tiles. During play, people try to increase their regions, in order to best match the varied scoring options. It mixes a bit of strategy and tatical decisions, to form a light game with some long term options.

[thing=176494][/thing] has a fine pacing, as players are only required to give prices to two tiles, choose one to destroy and, afterwards, buy a single tile from someone. The whole process can be quite speditious and downtime is rather low. A complete game, even with the full 5 players, usually lasts for less than 1 hour.

The production value is quite good: the art is pleasant and well done, the screens actually stay up, the tiles are sturdy and the money does its thing. The only complain would be that some tiles have several information and can be difficult to see all of them across a big table - still, is very minor.

Replay value is quite high: the random order of tiles, the different costs and destructions, and more: the different types of scoring and even the very order in which they are resolve, can change, and all of these have deep impact in how the game goes.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
On each turn the player receives three tiles that stays in front of the screen, and behind their screens, players pick one to destroy (return to the bag) and for the other two, they define costs to buy them, using their own money to do so. Once everyone have done this, the costs are revealed. In player order, each person can buy one tile from any other player, paying the cost to the owner, or pass. After each person bought or passed, tiles that weren't purchased are kept by their owners, with the money used to inform the costs being given to the bank. Now each player allocate their tile, following simple placement rules: different terrains on tiles can't be placed together, and roads can end anywhere.

After placement, scoring will happen. The central board informs wich aspects of the regions will be scored (like completed areas, or most boats, or biggest completed sea/lake, etc). A new round will start with player receiving income, and players behind in points, after the third round, will receive more money, as a catch-up mechanism.

At the end of the game, special tiles will score at this point, and for every 5 money the person has, she will gain 1 point.

After 5 rounds of taking tiles, buying and selling, placement and scoring, the person with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Define the cost of tiles. For me, this is the most important decision, not only because it will be what other will have to pay, but also for two reasons: it locks your own money there, meaning you won't be able to use them to buy tiles of others; and because it might net you money (if someone pays) or the tile (for the ones that didn't sell) - both things that are good, however, mainly at the right price;
- Which tile to destroy. The destruction serves two purposes: one, to prevent someone else from getting it; and, two, is possible that, later on, you will be able to buy it from someone else;
- What tile to buy. This is very important, but many times it will be a clear best buy for you. When there isn't, can be relevant to not only look for features in the tile, but also consider both the person that is selling (if you don't buy from someone, that person might not have enough money to buy a tile) and her region (what she will be able to do/score with the tiles if they don't get purchased);
- Where to place a tile. Important, however, normally not all that hard, and is derivative of the costs you put earlier and what you bought. Placing well can mean that, even with smaller regions, you can be able to score better.

As you can see, [thing=176494][/thing] offers a good amount of decisions, many with lasting effects, in a short frame of playing time, being able to be both light enough to not cause a brain burn, at the same time that it is deep enough to please those wanting from more meat in decision-making.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- High replay value;
- Nice production value - is pretty to look at;
- Language independent;
- A strong set of decisions in a small frame of time;
- The region and scoring grow during play, meaning the end is more exciting than the start;
- Not the easiest to explain (considering the different scores, placing rules, etc), but once the game is going, the pacing is fast.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- There is some luck involved in the draw of tiles;
- I found the catch-up mechanism too strong. It is hard to be in a bad place with the buying and selling, as if no one buys your tiles you get them, and if both are, you get the money. Maybe one or the other is better for you, still you don't leave empty handed. Yet the game gives a sizeable amount (specially when playing with 4 or 5 people) of money for those going behind. It isn't game breaking, and for a family game, is understandable to have a catch-up mechanism - still, I was a tad bothered by it;
- There are relevant interaction with the buying and selling, however the game still falls more in the direction of little direct interaction ([thing=822][/thing] , for instance, has more).

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like you are in the farmer's market of Carcassonne. You're in the market and want the best deals in order to return home and score better than your neighbours - everyone in their houses wanting to be be king of the street. At a point you will want the best fence painting and topiary; next, for number of chicken eggs and amount of firewood; then chicken eggs and pelts. [thing=176494][/thing] basically is [thing=822][/thing] with money, alongside solitaire regions (everyone have their own) and more things to score, in different moments.

[thing=176494][/thing] hits several good spots: light with decisions, fast with some interaction, building is fun, high on replay while still giving player control or knowledge over things. Their flaws are either minor (the amount of luck), not even considered bad (the level of interaction) or personal (my gripe with the catch-up). Overall, is a winner, with strong positives and weak negatives. It works both for family gaming time as well as in board nights with friends. Recommended.

RATING: 8.5
Good:
-Amazing replayability
-Plays in under 45 minutes
-No downtime
-Strong catch-up mechanism
-Bidding system adds depth and nuance

Bad:
-Strong catch-up mechanism
-Bidding system is punishing to noobs
-Animals near or on ranches title always confuses
-Don't like the 5/2 Scoring Tiles.  Balance issues arise if they are in the A scoring slot and the game can become stale if there are two of them out.

Overall:
This is probably my most played game as of late.  Every game is so quick and different that we find the time to squeeze in one game.  Often it is used as a long filler or night ender to when we have about 30 minutes left.  Despite its relative ease of play, the bidding mechanic makes it too nuanced for casual gamers...but gives it the staying power for my game group.  People who hate strong catch-up mechanisms will likely be turned off but I believe this is a big reason why it keeps coming back to the table.

Several comments place this game as a "classic" or "advanced Carcassonne". I find neither of those comments to reflect Isle of Skye. Like Carcassonne, IoS is a tile- laying game where one tries to construct a map of elements which optimizes scoring. While the core auction mechanism itself is not unique, how the mechanism is put together, is. The ability to purchase tiles from opponents, while pricing your own set of tiles with the intention of either selling it for profit or making it prohibitively expensive for others to purchase is a mind-bending exercise. The ability to select and discard a single tile from your individual pool also adds to the complexity of the decision-making tree.

   I consider all these "variables" to be both a strength and weakness of the game.  Some variables can be "adequately predicted" or at least partially "corralled" to help make good decisions. With blind, fixed auctions, that ability is somewhat harder to contain. While you may plan to obtain a certain tile, certain events such as player order or pricing will hamper your carefully laid plans. While you can determine your own pricing of tiles, it is also tough to gauge how opponents may react to your pricing. Also, different players, newbies, veterans or casual gamers often have a different way of gauging "value" of tiles. What one considers reasonable may be too pricey for others. 

   Auctions as a mechanism in gaming can be a wonderful tool to calibrate value of resources in a game. But, for some games, auctions can be an easy way for designers to let players determine their own pricing. It doesn't always work for all games particularly if there are multiple variables intertwined within the auction mechanism. It is much harder to judge value when too many factors, whether subtle or direct, come into play. This is one issue players face in IoS: Which tile to discard? which tiles I want to sell? which tiles do I want to keep? what other tiles people may want? which tiles may be priced out of my reach? What tiles may still be available on my turn? What elements are more valuable for me? Can the tiles be oriented correctly on my map? etc. The variables are numerous and even then, with all the planning, the tile may no longer be available for pickup when your turn comes along.

    Isle of Skye is not a bad game. In fact, I enjoyed it. I find the pace and length of the game to be just right. It's just that I am not sure I can ever find a way to be good at the game. That said, this game requires newbies to play a few games before having a good handle on the value of tiles. With the ever-changing rotation of games and players in some groups, this is can be a shortcoming.

Every now and then you play a game that surprises you. You take a quick peak at the back of the box, read a few comments on BGG, and then dismiss it.

As far as I'm concerned it's a complete replacement for Carcassonne with some more strategy from round to round that varies with the scoring tiles. Give it a try.

I can see this game firing a lot of tile laying games like Carcassonne.  I think it's fired Hunters and Gatherers for me.  And I was never a fan of the base Carcassonne anyway.

The great thing about this game is its variability and replayability.  In a single game at lower player counts you don't see half the tiles in play.  Then you have 16 different scoring possibilities.

It was immediately evident that this game was a keeper after just one play.  A great game to play in under an hour and especially great for time constrained couples with kids who want to play something quick, but still has interesting decisions.

Tile laying, in the Isle of Skye. It's a tile laying game that mixes scoring in a points salad type of way. Each new game you'll pick 4 out of 10 or 12 scoring tiles, that will allow you to score points throughout the game. This keeps the it fresh game after game.

Isle of Skye is much like Carcassonne with a couple important differences. First, you aren't stuck with the tile you draw from the bag. There is an opportunity to buy tiles from other players. Second, each player is building tiles into their personal kingdom. And lastly, there are no meeples. Once you place a tile, it is there permanently and will score for the rest of the game.

Every player gets a clan screenshot, a "destroy" token and a bit starting money. Then everyone draws 3 tiles which you place in front of your screen.
Secretly everyone now puts the destroy token behind one tile and money behind the other tiles.
Then everyone reveals and the destroyed tiles get put away. Now everyone can buy tiles from other players for the money they put behind the tile. If nothing is bought from you, you can keep them for the price you put behind.
After that, everyone builds their tiles on their clan territory (which only starts with a castle tile) just like in Carcassone. Then the round is evaluated and everyone gets their money and points. The player with the most points is the winner in the end.
This game is phantastic. There are many different tiles that you can purchase and build on but you have to evaluate the right price to not lose it and if not bought to not pay too much for it. It is very cool to put the tiles on your territory in order to win points (the conditions are drawn before the game, there are many different scoring criterias)
However it is best played with "casual" gamers, otherwise they will think a loooooooooong time for their bids.
To me this is one of the best strategy games I've played so far. Clear recommendation

This game is everything I hoped it would be.  A very fun, quick moving, light weight game that's easy to pick up but still chock full of interesting decisions.  The master builder phase of Mad King Ludwig was always a bit maddening to me, this game strips that down and allows everyone to do it at once.  Lots of interesting tile-laying situations, really fun, quick and accessible all around.

Surprising to myself, as much as I enjoy the game, I find myself less and less interested in playing it more.  Rating is dropping as a result.  Just feels like a lot of score management and a tacked on catch up mechanic.  The game rarely feels exciting.

Since I am not an utterly fan of the (similar) Carcassonne-family games, I was surprised that I liked this game a lot. The bidding system is very good (and has a nice catch-up built in) and the scoring system that differs from game to game make this a more versatile game (imho).
A downside is that you play tiles on your own "board" instead of all together. I guess it would be more complicated otherwise but that still has the same negative as most complicated games: You play with less interaction with the other players as a "normal" Carcassonne game.

One play, and it was nice. I was surprised that our group (two newbies and two veterans) actually finished the game in an hour. The game is not too long, definitely. That is good. It looks good, has some theme and replayability should be great because of the different scoring tiles. It is is a bit of Carcassonne and bit of Mad Ludwig (I've heard).

Scoring mechanic is quite good and setting the selling price for your tiles seems nice. I'd like to play this more, could easily be 8 with this content and game length.

Second play behind, still a good one. I'd like to try this with two players just to see how well it works then.

Add three more plays recently, still no duels, but a solid game still. I now have the Mad King Ludwig, which works nicely as a duel, but is a bit longer than this one. So I still like to try this as a duel and then probably buy this one.

I played a game of 'Isle of Skye', a tile placement game where you are trying to develop the most advantageous region and 'Why First?' that gets players dumping movement cards on their opponents over five rounds to acquire second place and win the game. Crazy stuff! I'm not normally a fan of tile placement but I did like the mechanism whereby you levy a fee for tiles you draw to either encourage or discourage your opponents from purchasing whilst they do the same to you. I got this slightly wrong in setting my price levels but players can capitalise on the monies they obtain in later rounds so you need to concentrate on which scoring tiles are coming along next so that you can maximise your scoring, whether on ships, each group of four concentric tiles, enclosed areas or animal herds.

Carcassone tile laying with bidding. Fun, short, moves quickly, lots of player interaction, and beautiful components. 

Not bad at two. Wish it lasted longer in general at all player counts.

This game punch in some nice amount of strategy and depth in 45 minute or so game. I really like the part where you need assign value to the tiles you draw. Do you set a high price so no one will buy them from you so you can keep them for yourself - but then you have to pay the price to keep them too.. You have to check what tiles the other players need. Therefore I like this game best at 2-3 players. 

One minus with the game is that there just a tad bit too much scoring after every round, which slows the game down.

RATING: 5
I'm a big fan of games that appear simple at first but reveal more complex dynamics with repeat plays. Reiner Knizia was the master of making 45-90 minute games that fit into this category. Isle of Skye follows the recent trend of doing exactly the opposite- a game that appears more nuanced at first blush than it really is. The pricing system is compelling in theory, but in practice the fact you can only buy one tile means you generally don't want people buying your tiles. Similarly the myriad of scoring tiles suggest a world of possibilities but each play feels more or less the same in terms of the choices you are making.

Think Carcassonne meets Alhambra minus the luck of card draw. I enjoy both of these games but Isle of Skye surpassed them both. It adds a clever bidding/auction mechanic that is a great new element to the genre. Also the catch up mechanic keeps all games close. Easy to learn and teach. This is a keeper

This is the first game I've ever seen take a real shot at firing Carcassonne. It's a little heavier, in that it features significantly more features to track and some price setting ala Castles of mad King Ludwig, meaning the learning curve to playing well is a bit higher. In the scheme of things, it is still fairly light so your average gamer will have no problem picking it up.

The goal system is probably the most important addition to the Carcassonne formula, as it gives you tactical direction each turn and helps your evaluations when setting prices for new tiles. This also has the benefit of also giving you a little bit of instant feedback, which again, helps keep your moves on point.

It's surprisingly quick for being a fairly meaty game, or maybe it's fairly meaty for being such a quick game. Either way, it's over in well under an hour and feels just as satisfying as a lot of games that take twice as long.

I enjoy Carcassonne because of the tile laying and completion of types of terrain. This has that as well as additional mechanics that put it over the edge for me. A little "brain burney" but in the best way. AP prone players may hold up this game, so I would recommend less than five players and it will play within a reasonable time. Very simple to learn as well as teach, yet tons of depth...I would say elegant.

The more I played the more I realize it is NOT comparable with Carcassonne. Yes this is a tile placement game with some extra twist on tile bidding and variable winning criteria, which is fun but I have a feeling that this is just putting some mini-mechanics into one.  

Compare to Carcassonne, which has a true feeling on city building with your planning being appropraitely rewarded when the game goes on, Isle of Skye is the one you just trying to 'meet' the requirements of each phase which is dry and articifical to me. I'm not saying that IoS is a bad game, but being the Kennispiele winner is by all means a surprise to me.

A decent game, but nothing special really. I don't think that it deserves Kennerspiel des Jahres - it's nothing groundbreaking, there are tons of more interesting games out there. Isle of Skye doesn't offer enough "meaty" decisions for my taste. I like the variable scoring though, it forces players to shift focus and set different priorities at various stages of the game. On the other hand, I just hate the artificial catch-up mechanism, no game should ever do that. If you are last it means that other players were better and deserve to win. Why give losers extra gold?

Carcassonne with knobs on. Variable points mechanism guarentees each game will be different. Artwork and box size are great. Like the buying/selling mechanism.  Based on how generously I rate rates then it should be a 9 and indeed I may raise it to a 9 but I am thinking about rerating everything which means an 8 is more realistic under my new regime!  No, after more plays, it definately warrents a 9.

Unimpressive and with big flaws in elegance. The fact that you start getting money for being behind is quite clearly an attempt to correct runaway leader.
The mechanic of buying from others is nice but all in all you don't get to make many decisions: tile laying is too straightforward since roads do not count. And btw, roads ending abruptly between tiles is really ugly

RATING: 5
I’ve seen lots of folks saying Isle of Skye fires Carcassonne for them, and after playing it, I’ll have to respectfully disagree. Yes, this game involves tile laying, but I think the meat of the game is in the buying and selling of the tiles you drew from the bag. Once you have the tiles, you then place them in your kingdom or lands or whatever it’s called and mostly try to line everything up neatly. I say mostly because you can ignore roads if you need to, though it’s better to connect them.

The gist of the game is you’re building your kingdom by placing these tiles. At the end of each round you’ll collect points based upon tiles that are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. You might get points for having lakes, farms, sheep, money, boats, squares of tiles, and other things. In a given round you’ll get three tiles, secretly price out two of them by placing their money next to them, and select a third to be discarded. Everyone then reveals their tiles and in player order you can buy one tile from another player by paying them the amount of money next to the tile (that player keeps their money and collects yours). If no one buys your tile(s), you get to keep them but lose the money. Whoever has the most points after six rounds wins.

I enjoyed my play of this quite a bit, the meat of it being the pricing which reminded me a lot of Castles of Mad King Ludwig, but with a less interesting theme. On the other hand, it plays quite a bit faster and is quicker to setup. I’ll likely keep it, but I’m not sure for how long.

Tile bag builder with auction and bidding. Reminds me of a hybrid of Carcassone, Keyflower, and King Ludwig. This game surprised me at Essen. So fun building your kingdom and so tense hoping you valued your tiles correctly. And the dread when someone buys a tile out from you that you desperately needed. I also love the value consideration of the multiplier scoring aspect from the random objective tiles. Using the axe token is the first game I can recall where a tile is chosen to send back to the bag each round for an added strategy element. Plenty interactive and you have to pay attention to the other kingdoms. Quick pace and managed downtime resulting from a lot of simultaneous effort in planning bids and placing tiles. Even though bid value is limited to two tiles each round it does induce AP moments especially with more players. At first I thought this could be a good travel game but the kingdoms do need table space to grow. All considered, I still love it.

I finally got to give this one a try. I really enjoyed the Carcassone-style tile laying and bonuses, and the hidden bidding and interesting round-to-round scoring worked well. Neat that a player could stockpile wealth and then unleash it all in a subsequent round. A close game, and very easy to pick up and play.

Very fun game. Variable scoring tiles give it a lot of replay value as well as completely changing the relative value of tiles both game to game and during the course of one game. Paying attention to what is being scored when is vital. Setting prices can be very strategic: do you attempt to get more money or keep the tile with a high bid at the cost of paying for it yourself or make tiles cost less to entice buyers and make a few gold? The artwork is pleasant and components seemed solid as well.

This isn't a Carcassonne killer for me. Carcassonne is static yet tactical, possibly a better 2-3 player game. Isle of Skye changes things up each game and due to the bidding is probably better with 3-5, a player count that I would avoid Carcassonne with naturally. They each inhabit their own niche to me right now.

It's a great game. Really a lot of tough decision here. Which is also what makes if a tough one to get to the table. I got it considering that it was another look in the "pricing" mechanism that I love in Castles. But since you have to do that every turn, that just becomes a bit overwhelming, for me and for the ones I play with.

Beautiful Tile auction game. I would agree that this deserved the Spiel any other year except last year (Legacy should have won). This is the closest a game has made me feel like I am running a market of sorts. I love the simplicity and how different it feels from most games. It is a mish-mash of a lot of other mechanics but basically: Get money, draw three tiles, put one back (ax), auction the other two or pay the amount you set if no one buys them, add them to your own personal Carcassonne and score points depending on what scores in whichever round it is. My only complaint is some of the scoring stipulations can really mess you up if you never seem to get the tiles you need. That aside, this game has the perfect weight of depth, just meaty enough without giving you a headache.

Player interaction and replayability is high. Downtime is minimal. Artwork and component quality is average. Gameplay is simple, with little rules overhead, but requires some thought on which tile to throw away and how to value the other two. The catch-up mechanism of having players behind in VPs receiving more money feels very artificial.

Honestly I don't know how this game could win the "Kennerspiel"-price. We played it with two and four players and every time we had big downtimes in every phase. Every player was somehow on it's own and we had not so much interaction. And one player would always be the one who has to take care of every phase. It has a very nice mechanic but it did not run smoothly for us. And we always had the problem with the roads. Why may the roads ends in an mountain? It was very distracting, also that the mountains will just abruptly end. Maybe we are more used to Carcassone ;)

I like a lot about this game; however, while the simultaneous price-setting on 2 (3 if you count the discard) items is [b]way[/b] faster than one person at a time setting prices on 7 items in [thing=155426][/thing], it suffers from the same problem, just to a lesser degree: Guessing the value of each tile for each player and setting an appropriate price (with the possibility that you pay that price) is flawed and tricky, but calculating it should be punishable by eternal elevator music. Nonetheless, there's lots of goodness here, and plenty of replayability.

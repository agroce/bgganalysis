A friend Kickstarted this, and we have been playing it at lunch.  My strategy the first game got my ass kicked.  Whatever you do, don't get the Lender first! (Or at all...)

My second game was much closer - I went for the camp first and was able to pick up two of the goals as well as built four buildings.  Next time I'll try for a slightly different strategy to see if I can win!

And my third game I kicked serious ass.  I mean, it was like the first game I played of this in reverse.  I used almost the exact strategy that was used against me in that game, while my component used what was almost my strategy from that game and I won by a landslide.  I figured out the superior combo.  Next time we are going to start testing to see if there is only one way to win - and if other options chance the game dynamic.

Fourth game was a tie, with me winning because I got the camp and the village.  We had the same number of victory points, the same number of buildings, etc... so we went into uber tie-breaking rules that were based on who controlled the most villages.  This game I started with the mill, then got the camp, then the union, then the harbor then the village.  It turned out pretty well.  Again, I'm not entirely convinced you can win without the mill.  But my opponent did start with the lender and didn't suck terribly this game, so that is progress.  Of course, we did make house rules for the lender, because it does suck on its own.

A light and fast worker efficiency game. Can be played in half an hour.

Pretty standard collect resources and build game with light sabotaging aspects added.

Overall production is good for the price and time.

Could be easily expanded to accommodate more players.

Talking about expansion, I'm gonna enlarge the board. It's too small for my liking.

Only played it once, so there's that.  Definitely think there's a problem with the special scoring chains, so there's that.  Presume that it will quickly fall victim to settler-quarry optimization, so there's that.  Still, I think this was a tremendous execution of a micro-game, and an example of how to do it the right way - cost, size, art, etc.  And the game was fun for me too.

You cannot imagine how much this micro game can deliver. It's fast, fun, but still makes you think hard enough. The only drawback is the size of the board. It's a bit small towards the end of the game when there are more than five workers. Nevertheless, highly recommended.

I prefer the iOS version better since there is no need to keep a constant account of the money earned or the amount of hammers that are still available.

I don't rate this highly because it is just too simple for my liking. There is some strategy but not much. A plus for this is that it is a very fast game.

The game is nice, yet the little board is too small for that amount of tokens and games tend to be too much similar.

My rule is that if it’s not a card game, it shouldn’t be a microgame. I don’t understand why Province should be that small.

RATING: 7
Great fun, simple rules with a decent amount of depth. Happily fits into a spare pocket if moved from the box to a poly-bag or similar.

The workers are cardboard chits which are quite wide compared to the spaces on the game board. This is fine at the start but can get fiddly once extra workers and structures come into play. It's still perfectly playable and to be expected at the price, but if you have spare cubes/mini-meeples these are a better fit.

How can a game with three sections, no dice and no cards possibly work?  This game is an act of brilliance that is so ridiculously simple but so clever with a variety of strategies and critical decisions.  With that said the game is always tight, showing very well-balanced design and execution.

While Province may not be the most lavish production for 5 USD you cannot go wrong and in terms of a two-player, filler game, I would say this is one of the best.

Elsőre úgy tűnik, hogy semmi értelme, de utána kezd összeállni a dolog, hogy nem érdemes mindig mindent munkást mozgatni, hanem figyelni kell, hogy a másiknak mit kaparunk ki a lépésünkkel.
Jópofa játék, bár nem tudom mennyi van benne, de ez egyelőre mindegy is.
-> 7.4 (de ebben már benne van a minigémségének a díjazása is)
-----
Nem tudom igazán élvezni, mivel egyetlen döntési helyzet pörög benne folyamatosan: tudok-e úgy ártani magamnak, hogy közben többet ártok az ellenfélnek. Ez valahogy frusztrálóvá teszi a játékot. Ráadásul minigémként, jó lenne ha hordozható lenne, de annyi vacak van hozzá, hogy nem igazán lehet elvinni sehova.

Right behind Le Havre: Inland Port, Province is my other favourite 2-player game. Gameplay is smooth and simple, but there's a deceptive number of choices to make on every turn.

Finally got to try this out.  We enjoyed learning the game and liked the mechanics of moving the workers around to gain labor and coins.  We're looking forward to seeing how this game plays once we've had a chance to play a few more times. We ended the game by taking all the victory tokens and we're interested to find out if most games will end that way or if we'll be able to build more structures.

I summarize. The first player always wins, unless your opponent has luck with the Harbormaster or goals.

I think it's more fun making if at every turn the player obtain resources (workers or coins) for all tokens. And just before you can move those tokens to which you have access.

Quick 2-player micro game in which you get types of actions based on the rotation of coins in the centre — and what you use them on will lead to more coins or cheaper actions later on.

There's more to this microgame than I initially thought. I was wary when I heard that it's a Kickstarter game. After the rules explanation this seemed to suffer from the usual lack of development of Kickstarters. But somehow Province with its three-space mini rondel worked and might even be the better [gameid=141736]. Further plays would show if the randomly chosen five goals (out of eight) provide enough randomization given an otherwise unchanged setup and if there is an optimal path of development. What I've seen though is still too average and small in scope to seek out Province again.

The mechanic of moving workers on a wheel to generate resources was surprisingly challenging. Difficult to generate what you need without giving your opponent everything they need. Building purchases are key in finding the extra resources needed.

Not a bad little game for $5. As raised by others the randomness of goals and instant grab if you are lucky enough is not my cup of tea and I may introduce house-rule that all goals face up from the start and claim ONE only on your turn if you can. That should reduce the luck element, the harbour I think works just fine - no hidden surprises just a bit of randomness to keep you on your toes.

A Euro microgame with a little bit more depth than immediately meets the eye. I didn't understand at first why you wouldn't always use all 3 green workers every turn or the point of the union, but denying your opponent money early in the game and getting up to just enough labor later in the game is really important. I feel like different play styles of different people changes up prioritizing which building to build first, as you want to be the first to build to get those crucial VPs. However, at the end of the game this is a very themeless game with not that much variety, has poor component quality, and barely whetting my appetite for the rondel mechanic. The low cost means this game will pay for itself, but if you never get a chance to play this don't fret about it.

One of my Kickstarter successes, Province is a two player microgame that lives in one of my bags. At this point, I have enough microgames to keep 1 in my car, a few at work, and one in each of my main bags/purses/backpacks. I'm almost never completely gameless. Province is probably my second favorite two player game. I got it during my kickstarter crazy period last year, and I definitely don't regret getting it.

It's a worker placement lite. There's a common resource wheel that both players use to generate tools and monies that they can use at different buildings to do different things. I'm really bad at explaining games that I don't know like the back of my hand. I'd stop, but I feel like I should be saying more.

This one fits well on the tray of a plane, although the bits are a bit small and fiddly and could end up all over the place with some turbulence.

The game itself was OK: take actions to get money, use money to buy stuff that lets you take better actions, get more money, and points along the way. Nothing special other than it was a surprisingly tiny package.

As far as affordable travel games go, this might not be beatable. A great little game with a deceiving amount of depth in it. The worker rotation idea seems, at first glance, to provide you with few choices. In reality though, you can use strategic timing of not moving workers to deny your opponent of resources they desperately need. The components seemed to be of an excellent quailty. I've heard stories of misprinted tokens but didn't experience any myself. Worth far more than $5. Will carry it around with me. Kickstarter. Received 7/20/2014, good condition all parts accounted for.

The cascading of bonus tiles is bizarre. Why not choose five at random and place them all face up from the get go? That way there is variability in strategy from game to game but with more visible paths to victory.

That aside, the gameplay is fairly bland. I like the core mechanic but perhaps there should be one more space available with a different resource. Add is, moves are reasonable scripted.

As my opinion is in the minority, I will play more and reevaluate.

One of the most deceptively evil/"screw you" hardcore euros I've played in a long time. My only criticism is that the bits are *far* too small and fiddly.

I backed this as a USD$5 cheapo game through the miracle of Kickstarter as it looked like it would be a good fit for my lunchtime games group for occasions when there are only two players available. Province is a simple worker placement game with a few added elements to give it a bit of depth and replayability. The rulesheet is probably one proofreading short of being fit-for-purpose, but for $5 one can’t quibble too much as most rules questions can be answered can be found here on BGG and the rest of the game is very well produced. The premise is that each player is a family (the red family and the blue family) vying for control of a small town. Control is expressed in victory points calculated at the end of the game. Points are earned through being the first to build a building, achieving whatever of the random goals is currently up for grabs (five or a possible nine are used in each game and only the one that is up for grabs at the moment is known) at game end.

Three plays so far and I am quite enjoying it (despite having lost every game). I am a little concerned that once both players are familiar with how the game works it may be possible to develop a single optimal strategy to the detriment of exploring other options, but at this stage this is just a possible concern. I’ll need to play it a few more times to really determine if this one is a ‘keeper’ or not but I am very confident that I have gotten my money’s worth with this game.

I only played against the "dumb" IA of the iOS version.

The first moves are "hardcoded", lack of balance between buildings, and not enough variable elements to grant replayability.

It will probably change against smart humans, when you add the factor of deciding what to move, but it will also lose fluidity.

I own the IOS version of this microgame. It's an okay game and nothing too amazing. The opening moves are predictable and then after turn 2 it's a blocking game to edge out your opponent. There is tactical decisions to be made for the goals but you also want to build structures first before your opponent. It all comes down to how well you move your meeple on the rondle and sometimes it is based on luck because the goal tile flips and luck can make you or break you.

This is a cute rondel-based microgame, where you move your tokens around these three possible spots. Two of them produce work points the other produces dollars. Then you spend your work on buildings or getting more dollars. The buildings give you small upgrades, more workers, and points for the player who gets there first. It's pretty solid and enjoyable, but I can't help but feel there is very little replay value.

This is actually a good game, it is a Euro worker placement game that plays in about a half an hour yet really gives a lot of depth.  The issue for us (and why we probably won't keep it) is that the game board is just TOO SMALL.  I realize that this is a micro-game, but it is just too micro for all the fiddly bits in the game.  I either want less fiddly bits or a game board that is double the size (which still would be small!). (JW)

Plays quickly and comes in a portable package, but this is little more than an analytical puzzle for 2 that tries to make itself harder to solve through limited random objectives. Doubt it has legs.

This is a decent worker-placement/rondel type game, where you move a shared pool of workers around to get use-it-or-lose-it labor and coins, which you keep from round to round. Your goal is to construct buildings which give you special abilities, as well as victory points, and there are goal tokens, which gives you something to shoot for. The footprint is super-small, which is great from a portability perspective, but frustrating otherwise.

I enjoyed my play of it, but I think that it would become pretty stale quickly, as there are only a handful of the same buildings, and they are always available. Good games in this space have an element of randomness to them that keeps them fresh and exciting to merit the many plays that make them worth the purchase cost.

RATING: 4
Mildly clever 2p micro-eurogame where players share control of workers on a three-space rondel: labour, labour, money. A combination of labour and money is required to build various buildings, which provide VP and persistent bonuses like additional workers. Rondel workers can only move one space, so there's room for some minor nastiness by holding some workers back -- positioning the workers to cause a shortage of money or labour can cause your opponent a minor delay.

It's a clever design, but not a game I have any interest in playing. It's like someone took modern eurogames and carefully distilled from them the concentrated essence of pointless tedium. There are few interesting decisions, virtually no interaction, and enough luck from the goal tokens that you might as well just flip a coin and call that person the winner.

It would probably be better if all goals were face up, which would at least make it a more complicated puzzle. I hope someone uses the worker rondel in a game worth playing; that part's got potential.

Wow!  

I originally wrote: "The size, graphics, and play through video sold me (esp the part where it was likened to Feld.)" and, in fact, my husband commented to me as well that it reminded him of Feld as well. This is a classic example of a game where so  little ends up having so much more to offer than you could think and why micro games really have me enthralled these days, and it will [i]definitely [/i] become one of the first games we pack when we travel. I do agree with the quibble re the 'turning' of the green meeples feeling a bit fiddly. I did use the worker tracker while my husband kept track in his head. Tight games (though I ended winning both) and a wish for micro-mini expansions!

A suprising amount of gameplay in such a small package, but the small pieces are difficult to play with.  Works really well as a two-player game, and it's harder than it looks.  A "deluxe" version with larger pieces would make the game more accessible to less-experience gamers.

Not bad for a fast game, but the mechanics of denying your opponents a resource to later (and now) deny -yourself- a resource just feels odd in practice. Why not always take two labor and a money? Need labor? Use it. Don't need labor? Take the money. Move everything. Leave the mancala-thing empty and just use the special workers. Two-coin "die-rolling" was a NICE element in the game. Haven't seen that before!

This is a micro game so you know what not much to be really expected however for a micro game like this that I only spent 5 bucks on I feel I got my money's worth. When it releases as a retail game for $10 I'm  not sure I'd pony up for that if I were you.

The game doesn't look like it's going to be something to play a lot because games are going to be very samey. The theme is super thin too but they were trying to make a euro. 

Bottom line I'm glad I got my KS copy of this and it fits nicely in lil box of micros that travels well.

Still need a few more plays to decide if this game has any legs to it. At the present moment, I am not sure there is a whole lot of replayability to the game. Given this is a microgame, I am not expecting too much from the design, but still would like to know that the outcome of the game is not entirely predictable. I find that microgames trying to introduce complexity in the game play often fail to see that the first few moves are some what predetermined. Perhaps this game is the first death knell for me in terms of playing microgames.

At first I thought this was mildly interesting with the mini rondel of 3 spaces. Unfortunately there's just not enough game here.

What's even worse is that the AI in the ios version is not very good. I once had a conversation with someone while playing the ios version, barely paying attention to the game, and I won. I couldn't even recall what happened in the last 3-4 turns of the game.

For those who missed out on the free download, let me put it like this; I don't think you missed out.

Not a bad little game. I forget to bring the physical copy out, but I like the iPad app. The simplified rondel is fun. I think Argicola: All Creatures Big and Small is a little better as a short 2 player Euro, but this one wins on size! The auto scoring of goals feels a little lopsided also - might need to be house ruled.

There's not a lot to this game, but it's a microgame, so what do you expect? It was enjoyable for a few plays, but it doesn't seem to have staying power.

Fun. iPad app might actually ruin the game for me.


Given away to a friend!

Quite a fun micro 2 player worker placement game. Limited replayability but a good filler game.

a 2 player microgame with unique worker placement rondel mechanic. It's so tiny that you can play it anywhere that has a flat surface.

The ultimate, super lite Euro teaching game, or a great quick duel between two experienced players.

A quick [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/race/user/Vroenis]race[/url] to complete ability granting buildings.

Super [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/fast/user/Vroenis]fast[/url] for a procedural Euro.

Another fantastic kickstarter with so much to teach, not just as far as Euro dynamics go, but also production, distribution and cost! This magnificent little game ships in an envelope and can be sent via standard post! It'll all fit in the zip-lock back included too, ensuring no external packaging materials are wasted.

Only played 2p a couple of times. Most games with unofficial solo rules. Fun but fiddly little micro-worker placement game. The limited options make you think ahead to block your opponent more than trying to gain resources you need.

Fun micro-euro. Not too deep, but scratches the itch. First player at a disadvantage? Second player is 7-0.

Good micro game if you have a dedicated 2nd player for fill, but really zero depth after 3-4 plays...

Two families vie for influence in settling a start up provincial town. Worker placement, city builder with first position control of the buildings which can be used by the other player. The game centers around a central worker pool to generate labor and coin for developing four scoring tracks for bank lending, camp labor, or the harbor. This game packs an impressive amount of strategy into a 20 minute game that fits in your pocket and can be played anywhere.  Pretty clever game.

This game is pretty amazing for what it is.  It manages to capture a worker placement Euro feel in a very small package.  I am actually really impressed by it.

As much as I like the concept in this game, I thought it was really hard to deal with the moving pieces and all. Idk, it's quite fiddly considering how small it is.

The flow of the game is also a little boring, it feels like a Tic Tac Toe that takes you way longer to figure out what the best move is.

Maybe this feeling could change with more plays I guess.

Good little game.  Depth is revealed through more plays and the realization that moving all available workers may not be the best move.

First impression: You can play flippantly and/or strategically, and it seems like there's actually depth here.  I look forward to playing this more to enjoy and explore its worker cycle mechanism.  Well worth the money!

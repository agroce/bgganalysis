GAME: Ici, c'est la France! The Algerian War of Independence 1954 - 1962
RANK: 3733

RATING: 9
Very ingenious system which does an excellent job of simulating this asymetric war. Every action has a reaction, one end of the seesaw goes down as the other goes up! For the French, massive military force does not on it's own guarantee a win and for the FLN it's possible to worm your way back into the game with the right combination of chits, luck and of course, skill.

Components are very nice indeed, the map in particular is first class. My only gripe (and it's very minor) is that some of the markers could have been back printed (population track markers for example).

Cuesta explicar las reglas y hacerlas comprensibles. El juego en sí no es complicado, pero tiene ciertas cuestiones de diseño (como la guía de población, las regiones, y si los efectos del terreno influyen en las ciudades) y ciertas cuestiones que lo hacen un poco confuso. Como juego es rápido y entretenido y con unas reglas bien redactadas sería muy interesante.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting game. I think it needs to be more streamlined. Given France's military dominance the units are too detailed when combat is so simple and the French nearly always win anyway. The rest of the game is too long and static. A simpler COIN type approach would work better. Also the tactic counters used in combat rubbed away after a single play.

Great topic for a game and a real labor of love. This feels rather like a Card-driven Game in the vein of Twilight Struggle, except that decisions about the employment of events and operations are divorced from one another.

A friend likes it because events aren't necessarily scripted but do fall out in a vaguely historical sequence (as opposed to many CDGs).

On the plus side, both the FLN and French players are playing very different games: The FLN is trying to flood Algeria with insurgents, drive the opinion of the French populace against the war, while swaying Algerian opinion in their favor. The French are trying to stem the insurgent tide, flush out their centers of resistance, while maintaining a popular appeal with the French Algerians.

On the down-side, the map is unnecessarily complex, right-reading for only one player, and hard to navigate. Real familiarity with the game is required, which some players may not ever manage through play. And while unnecessary, I'd like to see the event chits reproduced as a deck of cards with their effects printed right on them. Finally, the separate "wilaya tracks" that the author put together is a step in the right direction for keeping track of the state of various regions, but it seems even this could be simplified. (At least labeled with some info on how to use it.)

Update: Had a chance to play the game a second time. I did better as the FLN, but was brought down as the game entered 1960. While still fun, most of the game seems to revolve around creating and beating back the insurgents, But it seems that the most significant swings in fortune for both sides are as a result of the play of event chits—which only take a couple minutes to select and play. Perhaps I need to study the board better to understand where the key areas of FLN support and resistance are.

A very clever game on the Algerian War of Independence.  Both sides play completely differently (as they should) and there are several paths to victory.  I will be coming back to this one and trying new strategies over the years -- that is, it ain't leaving my "to play" pile.

On its way (compliments of my bro) 1/2010. :thumbsup:

After one play, I can say that this is my favorite irregular warfare game.  The ebb and flow is very :cool: with the battle for the population being waged alongside the combat in the country.  Very clever mechanics to represent the struggle.  Will get this on the table again soon! :)

After a second play, I dropped my rating by one.  The game is :cool: and I do enjoy it, but there is a cumbersome element to it.  What it attempts to simulate it simulates well, but that is achieved with a detrimental impact on game play.

Matériel solide et soigné. Mécanismes de jeu simples et cohérents. Mais les parties peuvent être lentes et assez répétitives : il faut attendre longtemps pour obtenir assez de points opérationnels (OP) et faire basculer l'influence politique d'une région.

RATING: 6
Ici is intriguing and very different from the wargame genres we've grown accustomed too.  It's as if El Grande grew a pair and found itself a true historical theme.

I get the sense that there's a really good game here.  Not a short game, but a game that flows well and challenges both players with an array of options in what could be described as an elaborate, historically grounded area control game.

The rulebook for such a unique game would have benefited from more illustrations, greater clarity, an example of play, and most importantly: cognitive structure.  It needs to teach the game as well as function as a solid reference.  Unfortunately, it does neither well.  Related rules can be on separate pages, an important rule is interrupted by a paragraph about a vaguely related, minor rule.  I suspect the rules were written by someone very familiar with the game and never proofread from the standpoint of someone learning the game, or for that matter someone using the rulebook as a reference.

The game has several graphic/ergonomic issues as well which are exacerbated by the game's unique nature.  

The difference between controlling and contesting regions has so little impact on play ... one wonders why it even exists.

After several plays, I find Ici a frustrating, fascinating game.  A game I want to love, a game I just want to enjoy, but a lack of development has left the gem too rough.

During my first session I made a better Political Support tracking system.  I'll probably make a rules summary and a chart tracking control of x2 and x3 regions for France and towns, cities and major cities for the FLN.  The publisher should have done these however.

The game is also very long for what it offers players.

One can see the greatness, the incredible potential of Ici.  Unfortunately, one has to get past the unnecessarily convoluted rules and insufficient development to do so.  I am not ready to relegate Ici to the "did I just pay you to let me playtest your game?" pile, but the fact is that for several months it remains on the shelf, passed over in preference to other titles.

Ici can be engaging and innovative.  I just wish it had been forged by a stronger hand.

Ici should have been a 9 or 10 ... 

3 plays solo
2 plays 2 player

Update: sold the game after deciding I'd probably never play it again.

Innovative design about insurgency warfare in Algeria. Both sides recruit, fight, move and using politics in different way. Very tense, good mix of abstract and chrome, high replayability. Good component quality. Lots of micromanaging due to constantly changes in control of a regions.

RATING: 3
I'm pretty much in total agreement with rstites25. Way too long, too repetitive,  and too overchromed for what it is, with most of the action being driven by event chits anyway. What's left for you to to do will require copious amounts of die rolling and chit selecting that quickly becomes a drag.

The iconography for the French units did not help matters, and just sticking with NATO symbols would have made things easier. The 8-hour playing time estimate for the Campaign game is very optimistic for a 32-turn game, especially if you're both new to the game. And by the time you've reached the midway point, the map is so busy and cluttered that it becomes a chore just figuring out where you can legally reinforce and move units.

That said, at least some of the pain would go away by using the Vassal module and just ditching the tactics chits for PBEM play. But, overall I think most people will prefer the upcoming 2-faction COIN game on the subject.

This is one of those games that get a perfect mix between complexity of rules and complexity of tactics and interactions. Rule-wise, it's pretty simple but it's the way that the game is made, with an asymmetric balance both in the rules and of the forces opposing each other that make it something special. Add to it that it is about a conflict that is fairly obscure to most (at least in North America) and you get a game that is quite intriguing and that will take many games to fully grasp and appreciate. Highly recommended.

RATING: 7
Good game about counter-insurgency with a proper wargame treatment (no euro-esque wooden cubes a la COIN series). Competent design which seems to have a good historical feel. Components are just decent, but punching the counters was a bit of a pain. It was a bad decision to sever political markers in green and blue ones, instead of using both sides of them for each colour. 

Rules are sometimes murky, luckily there is a second version of the rulebook with several useful clarifications; anyway, some details of the game are tricky and easy to forget.

The first game can be a zombie walk, because the dynamics of the game are quite peculiar and different from traditional wargames, so that the players must try different things to learn the system and what they have to do to win.

« Ici c’est la France ! » est un jeu particulièrement intéressant. Les mécanismes globalement simples des règles, par rapport au très large éventail de la simulation, rendent le jeu attrayant pour un très large panel de joueurs. Avec un sujet quasi inédit, un matériel élégant et de bonne qualité et un niveau d'historicité plus que satisfaisant, « Ici c’est la France ! » est une vraie réussite. Les stratégies envisageables, d'une partie à l'autre, laissent semblent par ailleurs présager d'une très bonne rejouabilité. Les parties sont néanmoins très longues. Les règles ne cèdent jamais à la simplification et prennent en compte, avec une honnêteté remarquable, la complexité à mettre en oeuvre une stratégie suivie pour l’emporter.

A refreshing and original approach to a mostly political conflict, with military operations playing a secondary (though important) role.

Nevertheless, belongs in every wargamer's library as THE reference game for a counter-insurgency war game.

I played this a couple of times a while back, and now I finally own it thanks to the reprint. I have not played Brian Train's game on Algeria (yet), but this design pulls off the seemingly impossible -- an insightful simulation of what would seem to be an ungameable subject, which is also very fun and challenging to play. Highly original design, or at least it seems so to me.

Typical of Legion Games, the graphic design and presentation are top end as well, as nice as anyone in the business.

This is the game I have been searching for on counter-insurgency warfare. By their very nature games like this tend to be more abstract then pushing normal wargame counters around (if that isn't abstract enough). There is always going to be a reliance on population tracks and status markers. But this game is full of narrative and makes you feel a part of the situation. 
Even if you are not particularly interested in the events in Algeria it still works as a general game on counter insurgency warfare presenting you with the same basic problems faced in Afghanistan, Vietnam etc.
This is the first game I have bothered to rate or comment on so it must be doing soemthing right.

2nd Ed owner ...new art ...Shame they did not put in a thicker map instead of a thinish old school paper one ...I would have paid a little more ...but guys really paper, I have white blotches on fold lines already which really show up against glossy print and only opened map twice !!!

Rating it an eight for game play but five for components ...particularly the papaer map which now has very distinct white panel lines where it's been folded ...

Despite my major issues with the map ...the game is excellent ...

The designer told me this is a product of awesome quality ..hmmm ...maybe 20yrs ago ...he has obviously not looked at the quality of games from COA, GMT etc ...

The counters are nice and thick ...and despite being told there is no need to clip ...I clipped mine as sit better and it stops the edges of the counters from rising at the corners ...

A great game about a difficult subject. The rules are simple but the interaction between the various level of the war are very difficult to master. Like the historical sides, you'll have to learn how to conduct an insurgency or counter-insurgency war.

Best wargame on counter-insurgency warfare

Starred First

RATING: 4
I really wanted to like the game, but it left me disappointed for a handful of reasons.

1) The game is too long for what it is. It's not the overall length that's the problem, it's the repetition of doing the the same thing over and over and over again with little impact on the game.

2) There are a ton of different political tracks--but players can't really impact most of them. This is the type of thing that I love, but unfortunately, players only have a minor impact on most of them. The game uses a political events phase where players can play a political event to impact a lot of these tracks at the start of the turn. Unfortunately, players seem to just alter the timing of how things change more than actually effect the change themselves. The Pied-Noirs, Governmental Crisis, FLN, and French Public tracks are, from what I recall, only impacted by the Political Chits, but they're critical to the flow of the game and winning/losing the game. Unfortunately, there's no player agency to impact them. If the FLN being too high is causing the FLN problems, there's nothing to do but wait for the right chit to be drawn and played. There's nothing in-game to change it. So too with the PN/Gov't Crisis/FP tracks. 

3) Political Support is too granular. Each of the 20+ areas has a Political Support track from 1 to 20 that fluctuate during the game. Some from player decisions; most from the Political chits. Ultimately, its this placement that determines the odds of the yes/no vote of the referendum (which is probably how the game will end). Most player decisions move ONE of these ONE step up or down. The chit tracking this popular support can also be at one of four levels. At the extremes of the four levels, the chit won't move when a political support marker is played by the opposing player in the political phase (while all the other chits will). There are some other minor effects as well. The biggest impact is that if you get it maxed in your favor, it will jump to your side of the 1-20 political level. For example, if the French player gets a marker sitting on '5' (which is in the FLN's favor) to Support, instead of jumping 1 spot to 6, it will jump all the way to 11. 

4) Population plays a minimal role in determining victory. There are various impacts of the Population on the game, but ultimately neither side is winning over the population per se. The "Referendum"--the second of which will likely end the game--is based on each area's yes/no vote regardless of population. As a result, gaining support of a low-population "1-pop" area has the same impact on victory as gaining support of a high-population "3-pop" area. 

5) The "policing" aspect of counterinsurgency is completely abstracted--and it comes into play through the Political Chits. The difficulty for the FLN in gaining control over an area is completely dependent on the abstracted "garrison" value, which represents the allocation of troops to garrison/police ALL the various areas//regions equally. The French player increases the value by play of political chits, which the only decision is timing rather than any strategic decision to allocate resources to increase the garrison value. From what I recall, there's nothing for the FLN player to do to reduce the number. Abstraction of this aspect of counterinsurgency seems to be about the same as OCS without on-map supply tokens.

It takes a little while to figure out what you are supposed to be doing, and the rules don't provide you with quite everything that you would want at your fingertips--how the individual event effects work, for instance--but this ends up being a very engaging game on the war in Algeria, and one that provides a great deal more narrative flavor than your typical COIN design.  It's not for everyone, but anyone who has interest in either the subject matter or in modern counterinsurgency should check it out.

So far, quite interesting.  Wish I had a local opponent, because there are some interesting elements of bluffing that don't get to shine in solo play.  I didn't really grok the political system until about halfway through my first game, but I think it's well done and does a good job linking politics and military action.  The interrogation system and the battle display are fun little mini-games, and the political chits combine well with the action on the board to give a strong sense of narrative.  Turns get a little similar -- it's a grind, not a fireworks display -- but such is the nature of a prolonged insurgency, and it makes those moments where things do suddenly shift that much more exciting.

I reached a point at the end of my first game in which both sides were very focused on preserving and influencing the regions they controlled, with little combat occurring.  I'll be curious to see if that's at all common or just a result of inexperience.

I bought this game because of the favorable comments on BGG. How disappointing. The game is way too long for what he achieves. A big part of the chrome (combat chits, different types of FLN units...) is pointless.
There are some clever mechanisms but they are surrounded by a sea of useless stuff. At one point in the game I was not even throwing the dice anymore : if the french was finding my FLN units I was eliminating them automatically. But even saving that time couldn't help my opponent and myself finishing the game. We threw the towel...

RATING: 8
I found this to be an interesting asymmetric game. The game plays differently from most wargames. Like Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001-?, the strategies are often indirect and it takes awhile before the interactions between area control, population markers, the sentiments of the French public and the local pied-noris, and the logistical capabilities of FLN start to click. This game would have benefited from an extended example of play to show how it all fits together. There is a lot more chrome in this game than Algeria: The War of Independence 1954-1962, but then this game has more chrome, is more complicated, and takes quite a bit longer to play. However, I felt Ici, c'est la France! The Algerian War of Independence 1954-62 captures the historical events and the feel of the civil war better.  

However, I downgraded this game to an 8 because of one flaw.  The FLN player cannot win other than by getting to collapse or winning the second referendum.  That is solely determined by the play of political chits.  As a result, no matter how much of a "lead" the FLN player may get, he is stuck waiting turn after turn for political chits.  As a result, the game can get stuck in rut where little changes turn after turn.  Alternatively, it may become obvious that the FLN cannot win several turns before the game would actually finish.

RATING: 8
Ici, c'est la France is a complex game about the Algerian War.  It’s an average size game, but one with a lot of moving parts.  No particular mechanism is difficult to learn, but there are lots of them.  And, there are multiple interactions that are not at first obvious, any or all of which can (or will) impact on a player’s strategy.  It's taken me a couple of abortive starts to finally feel I have a handle on the mechanics, and what each side needs to do.  That does not mean I think I have mastered anything, except maybe the game turn sequence. 

The game is extremely well designed (and probably play-tested to an inch of it's life), but it would not have been bad thing to cut the turns from four to two or three per year (1954-1962), or cut down the contested regions from 25 to something a little less numerous, since each one has to be adjusted, and fiddled with each turn.  

Time to play is my main reservation.  I mostly play quicker war games (3 hrs, for me is quick). But, there is always a place for an engaging game that takes longer to learn or play.  BTW, the rules are mercifully short.   Their layout is functional once one delves into the turn sequences.  You will get familiar with them because it’s impossible to remember every detail of every action.   If you have the time (and the modest table space), it's s challenging game.  It's more like Chinese checkers than checkers.  Both sides have a myriad of options, and I believe both will have to be flexible and always planning ahead, or risk falling behind without a lot of chance to recover. Admittedly, this takes place at a slow pace; there aren't many decisive moments.  There are no less than 3 completely separate ways to win or loose the 22-28 turn game, and the seeds of victory or defeat are planted mid-game or even earlier.

All this intrigue comes at a price--A long game, with lots of repetition.  And, you will not have the satisfaction of seeing your panzers make a dynamic Drive on Stalingrad, or the agony of watching them surrounded by a crushing counter attack.  Yes, an 8 yearlong war is by nature drawn out and won or lost incrementally.   There is a lot of nibbling at the edges for the FLN, and a lot of stamping out fires for the French.  However, this is also not simply a straightforward counter-insurgency game with the French spending all their time stamping out game controlled FLN incursions.  The French have to fight a political game (or two) to win.  The FLN have a complex task, they are every bit as busy as the French, and have to be agile and innovative.  This is not just counter-insurgency, it's also fully an insurgency game. 

The components are excellent.  You do need to download the alternate Public Support tracking chart, or make one for yourself, the one on the map is too fiddly.  I wish the population symbols did not blend in with the mountainous terrain, and that their "x2" and  "x3" signs were more distinct, but those are my only component complaints.  I don't know why the region control counters were not double sided, but whatever.   Overall, a high quality game.

If you have the time and table space, and want to play something different, this is a challenging game about a fascinating subject.  It also plays well solitaire.

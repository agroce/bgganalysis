The one thing that stops this game from being a 9 or 10 is the lack of competition and sort of lackluster ending. There's also limited impact from actions taken throughout the game outside of impacting your aspects. Overall, this can be a fun story to tell together!

I got to play Fog of Love with a friend at SPIEL 2016, and got a chance to discuss the ins and outs of the game with the designer afterwards. 
We played a very incompatible gay couple. We had our ups and downs in our one year relationship, even got engaged (not out of love though :-P ). This didn't turn out well as my partner quickly found out that I was still married to my former lover (ups). In the end my angry partner won by bullying/dominating me into staying in the relationship, and while I tried to convince myself that my love for him was unconditional, I lost as this feeling just wasn't true.

GREAT GREAT and very funny game! Most of the situations the game drags you through are immensely cliché, but these clichés only serve to generate tons of laughter as it is set up as a whimsical romantic comedy. The Theme is strong with this one. Gameplay generates lots of questions and reflections ´bout the dynamics of relationships and the nature of love, but still remains very "tongue in cheek"!

We'll see how it holds up in the long run, but for now I'M SOLD!!

RATING: 8
Very thematic, love the minimalist design and concept of the game. This game is perfect for couple that just got together and wanted to know each other more. However - there is few things that you should consider before start playing with your another half (he/she).

#1 - If you are not in healthy relationship, don't play.
#2 - If you are in a long/tasteless/bland relationship already, it feel bland too as not much excitement, you just play it as a game (no longer thematic) and it's pointless.
#3 - This is not a game for gamer mood/mindset, don't think of scoring to win the game, play it as it's your life.

I particularly do not enjoy the "virtual character" that you have to create in the game. When I played, I ignored that part and putting myself and my other half as the player of the game, it definitely put more meaning into "why play this game".

Well anyway, I just went through the tutorial part, girlfriend doesn't like it so I guess I won't have chance to explore deeper part of the game. Good luck for you all who playing this game and hope somebody would read my review before start to play!

P/S - Thank you my friend who hosted the game for me and my girlfriend, but this is a game that involved confession of heart, so best play w/o any third party around.

A fantastic game that is easy to roleplay and get into. My wife, who has never roleplayed before in her life, got into her character (Millie the wedding planner) and her burgeoning relationship with Jim (the security guard). The tutorial is an amazing piece of design that all games need to learn from. The main barrier of games for her is rules explanations, she loved the learn as you go model. Great experience, looking forward to playing the next story!

If you're looking for a game with deep and rich gameplay mechanisms, this isn't for you. If you try to even think too much about "how to win" or how the win mechanisms don't lend themselves to playing the theme, this isn't for you.

If however you're looking for a fun game, one rich with emotional depth, laughter, and storytelling, buy this game immediately. It's some of the most interpersonal fun I've had with a board game ever, and it's what board games were meant to do: foster thought and fun between people who want to spend time with each other.

RATING: 7.5
This is quite interesting and fun. Play acting a relationship and managing your own needs versus the needs of the relationship (and whether you/your partner even have the same desired outcome) is quite interesting. Some of the card/situations are unclear as to who is taking what role in the situation, so that's my biggest complaint. Also, the box/insert is huge and I don't understand it.

After all this waiting, I was hoping this game to be great. I played a teaser in Essen '17 and I liked what I saw. In reality, it's neither a great not a bad game. With enough roleplaying your character, things are spiced up and interesting but bottomline is that you don't necesserily have scenes (cards in your hand from which to play) that make thematic sense to the situation. On a different note, you have enough (4-7 depending on the version you got) that can keep the game fresh, but do not expect miracles in that aspect. The production quality is indeed on the hish end spectrum (even though my copy came quite banged uop because of the lousy fulfilment for the kickstarter campaign, shipping with no extra padding/protection in the box etc.). I'll try to play with people other than my gf, see if the 'play with your significant other' wins over the 'above all, don't play with your significant other' theories out there (I personally enjoyed my session with my gf well enough.

One of a kind two player game where you are both in a relationship trying to work things out and stay true to yourself. 
It's an amazing experience. Gameplay is really easy and straightforward. You play scenes one by one and react on them based on the character you are. You want to always stay true to your traits as you score satisfaction for completing them at the end of the game. But also, you want the relationship to be successful so you might want to sometimes do something against you for the greater good. Or maybe you need to change?
The best part is looking at the final situation at the finale. Finding out what were the traits of your partner and what destiny they chose to seek in the relationship. Did it work? Did the combination of those two personalities had any chance of success, was it meant to be or was it doomed at the start.
The parts when you both react same way on a given scene feels great, and when you react differently you might be truly disappointed. Thanks to a roleplaying part you start to identify with your character but also start to notice the needs and efforts of your partner.

An amazing and unique gem in a boardgame collection.

RATING: 9
We got to play an hour of this as a demo at GenCon 2017 and absolutely loved it. Each player is trying to achieve their "destiny" card, which is their win condition. You start with all possible destiny cards, and as you play and see how the relationship is going (and how good of a match your characters are), you discard destinies that you don't think are where the relationship is headed. Your character starts with traits that help guide your choices and determine how good of a match you are with the other player. Then you play out "scene" cards that are moments in your relationship that you get to make choices during. These choices will shape the relationship and affect your characteristics. This is a great, approachable strategy game and if you want to act out the scenes, it's even more fun and often hilarious. Because you choose the destiny card you are playing towards, each player can win independently of the other by fulfilling their own character's destiny- this could be being equals in love, being a heartbreaker, or leaving the relationship honorably. The game has surprising depth and a huge amount of theme. Since we have only played once, we can't speak to the longevity and replayability of the game, although we anticipate this game being well worth it and providing hours and hours of fun.

Really wanted to like this game, but the decision making seemed vague and confusing.  There wasn't really a well defined goal - is it a co-op or a competition or just a story telling game?. I guess this just wasn't for us. The production value is amazing though and we found the tutorial helpful.

For some of you, this won't be a game. After all, it has a goal, but no winners or losers. It's not even a co-op. It's just the playing out of a romcom story. That's it. However, it certainly has very gamey elements. For instance, reading your fellow player so that you can manipulate the game state in order to get the ending you want. Deciding which tools to use in order to get what you want, and which ones you should abandon. And abandoning tools comes with a cost, as you get penalised for doing so. Much like Dead of Winter, you don't end up with a memorable story at the end (although it is at least coherent, unlike in Tales of the Arabian Nights or Fortune and Glory), what you end up with is memorable vignettes and lots of laughs.

Also, the box and components are beauty.

The first play was a decent experience that was new to anything I've played before. Played with the wife. The main problem is that the scene cards do not really tie in to the date at all.

RATING: 9
Fascinating design, though not exactly our usual game-day fare.

Shines brightest with with at least a bit of roleplaying and a player-focus on enjoying the story, but there's a very good mechanical core built around goals (both large and small), telegraphing & trying to interpret your partner's telegraphs, the fact that you *can* both win (but don't have to), and that you may be shooting for very different objectives. There's interesting hand-management both of scenes and destinies, each with its own dynamic.

Look forward to exploring this one more. I'm faintly concerned that the Scene decks will get repetitive - from a mechanical POV this is a non-issue, as the variety of game effects (Trait and Satisfaction modifications in particular?) are what's most relevant, but it could hurt the roleplaying / storytelling.

Played a preview version at Bastard Cafe in Copenhagen with my wife. We had a few questions about the rules, but I really enjoyed the game. The role playing aspects are really strong and important to help your character move along. 

I made the mistake of playing too much to my traits rather than working on the relationship as it was and this cost us the game, much like it may cost a relationship. Really fun and much different than most of the games we play.

This is a really interesting game that involves a bit of roleplay (if you want) & mindreading.
The game is a bit rough for anyone not fully understanding english as each aswer is something different and it adds flavor to the game.
The cards are also not precisely translated to get the meaning the designer wanted them.
This game has a fully playable tutorial which just needs minor settup and no rule reading as tutorial cards that you read will teach the game, this is something amazing and well put as it did worked.
The tutorial is very basic and I hope further love stories expand this and give extra flovor & mechanics.

Nothing better in a light roleplaying experience when you manage to weave in elements of your own experiences (including your knowledge of pop culture and art) to create an emotionally convincing and memorable story for the couple you play.

I'm rating this before playing, based on the Watch It Played tutorial & looking over the game (I am a KS backer & they got the game to me on Dec 22nd).

Ordinarily I would not rate a game prior to playing -- but what the heck is up with people assigning 1s to a game to bring down the rating just because they are upset about how the KS was run?  That's a complete disservice to other BGGers who just want to know how good a game is, and might not drill into the comments to see that many of the  low ratings are due to spite & have nothing at all to do with the game.

About the game:  it strikes some people will love it, and some people won't get it at all & wouldn't play it if you paid them. I completely understand that. Personally -- I'm  usually not a role player, but I am deeply in love, and my wife and I look forward to playing this.

The tutorial 'story' is really well done here integrated into the decks so you literally get everything out the box and draw tutorial card one and play, which is a really nice way of doing it.
There is quite a lot of reading and we added quite a bit of roleplaqy (and he was a sod...calling me fat and arguing with me at every turn... what kind of man says yes when you ask if this [insert clothes item here] makes you look fat?)
It was really good fun. I can see how it could degenerate into I do this and play this for this symbol... or and there is some story I dont care about...... but if you embrace the roleplay it can be fun

Was not impressed by the tutorial game.

A series of disconnected vignettes, similar to other "storytelling" games with minimal prompts for role-playing proper through a deck of scenes that vomits random stuff at the players (filtered through players' choosing of scenes, though useless cards swiftly clog the hand). The game culminates in a lackluster finale in which the players choose one of several victory conditions that they already roughly know whether or not they even can meet the prerequisites.
Each of those scenes plays out with the characters choosing responses in hopes of accruing personality tokens to possibly influence satisfaction levels by way of end-game traits, but the knowledge of what outcome results from each response renders the storytelling opportunities into dull maths. Individual scenes (and the responses to them) are rendered in such excruciating detail as to make the effort of role-playing unsatisfying as creativity is discouraged.

More play necessary to confirm my scathing criticism.

We felt that the player aid cards used in the deck would have been more helpful had they been placed one round earlier with most of the concepts. They clarified things we weren't entirely certain of in the hands preceding them and it left us feeling like we needed to check the rulebook.

This is a great game for storytellers. Those of us who also love RPGs will find this a match made in rom-com heaven. As the game progressed, our comfort level with creating a story instead of straight reading the cards (which is also perfectly fine) increased dramatically. 

Overall it's a game that won't satisfy an itch you know you have. It's hard to pin down and it won't give you a sense of victory points pride. But it is a lot like Tales of the Arabian Nights in that the story you create for yourself is the best part.

Being a game designer myself, I refrain from giving ratings, but with this one, I will break this rule. This game is perfect... especially if you're into storytelling. The number of stories it can generate is mindblowing. I tested it with my wife at this year's Essen (2017) – I played a stuttering, introvert musician in shabby clothes who dreamed of being an extrovert macho. My wife was a police officer with bedroom eyes and a scar on her face, who eventually turned out to be a corrupt cop. My musician did not mind as he fell for her very quickly and after a while she reciprocated the feeling. This was, however, only the first phase of the relationship, and we did not manage to get to the 'drama' part (we did not want to block the table, so that others could try this marvelous game) so I have no idea how the relationship evolved.

Anyway – the storytelling part is awesome, which does not mean that the game mechanics is neglected. Quite the contrary. I like elegant designs and this one is the best one I have ever seen (I've been playing all kind of board games for 20 years now). Supposedly it was playtested about 1000 times and it shows. The elements interact, the system works and everything is there - on the board and cards - so once you start playing the game elements practically lead you by the hand.

That being said, the biggest mistake you can make when playing Fog of Love is to focus on the mechanics – focus on the the story you and your gaming partner are creating instead. The mechanics is there to support it (and it does a great job doing that), but it is the love story that will grasp your imagination. Sure, after some time you will start thinking about the direction you want this relationship to go (the Destiny Crads are a blast!) and, subsequently, you will start playing to win, but the best thing about this game is that no matter if you win or lose, you will leave the table with another great love story that will stay with you  long after you're done playing.

I would definitely recommend this game to couples who are into storytelling and prefer to enjoy their company rather than to win at any cost. I came to Essen with a firm resolution that I would not be going home with a game that takes more than 30 -45 minutes to play, but Fog of Love changed my mind. Please, send me the damn game already ;)

It hurts to rate this so low, but i wouldn't really wanna play it again. Wich is a pity because the concept is VERY innovative & works in itself.
What keeps me from enjoying this is the huge ammount of text one's gotta read on all the cards & the bookkeeping element with all the tokens.

I really enjoyed making decisions with my partner about crises cards. I liked the narration of sweet new love, trouble & final decision that follows a relationship. I liked the individual winning options, one player could win by ending the relationship because he's valuing his freedom most & the other could also win by learning what not to go for or loose by not letting go, depending on the fewer and fewer outcomes you can choose from.

So although the mechanics worked in themselfs, they were (like so often with these kind of games) detracting from the fun (role-playing-part) of the game.

Kudos for this bold work, it's a piece of love, no doubt.

This is an experience, there is a game in it for sure, but the real draw is just letting yourself get into the character and just go with it. It is a wild ride and I would recommend it to anyone. Highly. No min/maxing, no power gaming, just pure fun and silliness and an amazing back and forth.

Interesting two-player... I don't even know what to call this thing. Semi-cooperative quasi-hidden identity game? It's a mini relationship simulator with roleplaying elements where you try to make a connection between two (potentially very different) people work. 

Fantastic production values, well put-together tutorial system, excellent rulebook, and interesting idea. Play it (or at least watch the Rahdo) because there is absolutely nothing else like it. Honestly unsure how much replayability it'll have, which is why it's not higher.

Not for everyone, but for those who like some roleplaying it works extremely well. A great 2 player game to play with anyone you feel comfortable talking to about relationship stuff. Easily one of the best looking games I own, and has hands down the best tutorial system I have ever seen in a game.

"Overall, Fog of Love isn't quite like any game I've ever played. Sure, it has things I love about games (great art, superb graphic design, a rock-solid tutorial), but this isn't like a "X, but with Y" that you often see in the gaming sphere. The closest comparison I'd draw is to Near and Far, but even there the narrative isn't quite as much of the game as it is in Fog of Love. That's a significant advantage if you enjoy narrative-driven games, as you can roleplay your character and dig very deep into their motivations. On the other hand, if that's not to your liking, then this will very much not be the game for you. In Near and Far / Above and Below, you can mostly ignore the narrative if you'd like and focus on the game, but in Fog of Love the narrative is the game. To play the game is to buy into the narrative, and to ignore the narrative is to fundamentally not participate in the world the game seeks to create. I think that's a really interesting premise and I've enjoyed what I've played of it (a lot!), but I can wholeheartedly say this is not a game for everyone.

But you know what? No game really is, and that's okay."

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I enjoyed my first play with Garry's PnP production with the first scenario. It was frustrating not to be able to build on one trait that never came up on the cards despite needing it for my goal cards. We played the co-op version of the game and didn't quite make it. I met my relationship goal but Garry did not. There is some "role-playing" that occurs as you decide how much to be in character and how much to try and play a deduction element as well. Sometimes one must hurt the relationship short term in order to build it for the long term...

The idea behind Fog of Love is very intriguing - you and your partner play as characters with a unique set of traits, features, and occupations, and see if a relationship between you works out. The game plays out like a romantic comedy, with a loose plot structure with many scenes that occur. Like a choose-your-own-adventure game, both players will get to choose how their characters react to various situations, and then the game determines how that affects their relationship, as well as their personal goals and aspirations.

Fog of Love is mostly successful at crafting interesting and silly romance stories, but getting inside the head of the other player's character can be difficult, and some of the game's assumed associations between decisions and outcomes are often debatable. As a result, the game is a little rough around the edges, but the overall experience is positive, and the component quality is superb.

I would definitely recommend Fog of Love to couples that like gaming, especially RPGs or choose-your-own-adventure games.

Oh my, this game is genuinely mind-blowing. It is an amazing role playing game of a relationship. There is just so much tension in this game. I have had a different relationship every time, some of which weighed heavy on me, they even had me thinking for a while afterwards. There was this relationship between a boy and girl who really did all their best to make it work, but they just did not understand one another. The relationship failed, even though both of them did everything they could to make it work. Powerful stuff!

Amazing game, being completely different to any other thing I've ever played. A romantic relationship simulator which does an incredible job, creating games that are small, fictional relationships on their own.

PROS
- Amazing simulations. In every game, you start just gradually knowing each other, getting to discover their personality and goals step by step. Then, you can start seriously working in your relationship with all that knowledge.
- Huge replayability. The game comes with different packs that are supposed to be opened one by one, gradually increasing its complexity. The total number of cards is quite high.
- Top-notch production (I have the KickStarter version).
- Superb graphic design.
- It allows the players to recreate homosexual/homoromantic relationships.

CONS
- The game relies on roleplaying. If one of the players cannot do it, or separate their characters from themselves, the game isn't gonna show its potential.
- Two players only. There's no possibility to recreate non-monogamous relationships.

Disappointed.

+ Working tutorial. Had to look in the rulebook once. The fact that there IS a rulebook is a huge step up from, let's say, Charterstone.
+ Visual design of everything is top notch. I was getting a feel similar to when you open an apple product for the first time.
+ The mechanisms were clear and simple.

- After playing through the introductory scenario I was left wondering if the experience can be called a game. I.e. decisions are trivial, cards don't interact between them. I had a feeling that I was going with a flow for the most part and then it ended.
- There's this thematically weird dynamic that once you've accumulated enough of your tokens on a track to complete your character's hidden motive (or whatever it was called), it sort of doesn't make sense to keep following the same line of behavior as you now need to accumulate tokens on other tracks.

A friend and I tried this game in Essen 2017.
Preamble:
- we sat down to try the game because we are tired, not because we were interested in the theme and most tables were free. 
- we were both female (and not in a relationship with each other :P)
- played the game only once, and we didn't finish it because we didn't enjoy it
- wrote this comment because the designer emailed me asking about the rating
Likes:
- We liked the fact that we could both choose to be male or female, so not just traditional relationships being played out.
Dislikes:
- the game requires a lot of reading by yourself, before you interact with your game player to tell them about your decision of game play
- slow paced game
- Full game takes a long time, we played the short version and it already that took us.. what.. 45 min and it wasn't possible for us to reach our personal goals in the 45 min, would need to play full game for the goals to be attainable.
- Also didn't like that we made decisions based on the tokens that we would get so the game kind of drove us in a certain direction, decisions were made for us. After a while we didn't even read the card anymore just decided based on what would give us certain tokens to reach our goals. Maybe it would be nice if the outcome of the decision was not visible until after the decision was made.

RATING: 3
Tutorial is actually more confusing than reading the rulebook. I think this tutorial will actually hurt the game more than help as it diminished our desire to play again. For a game that will exclusively sell at walmart, it’s not exactly easy to understand. More importantly,  it’s boring, slows down the pace, has no ending, and it’s not even set up correctly for proper play.  Basically killed any desire we had to ever play the game again and I sold it. 

We found various problems with the tutorial. 1) ended up with no scenes in hand. Was not clear we were supposed to redraw. This is clear in the rulebook. 2) some tutorial cards reference things that have not happened yet, like telling us to exchange destiny cards, but we have not even reached the tutorial card that tells us to draw destiny cards. 3) was not clear that we were both able to look at the scene cards. We thought one read the options and then one picked without ever seeing what aspects they would gain or lose. 4) reaction cards are confusing in the tutorial. Easier to understand by rulebook.
5) I read out loud secret cards because they look like scenes. Only after reading the secret does it say ‘Secret’. Why wasn't ‘secret’ put on top of the card in large letters so you don’t start reading it out loud? This happened twice, so my wife knew both my secrets.  6) completely missed reading and acting out the synopsis card in the tutorial which seems like it should be a major part of the game. 

Some of the cards were so confusing we just skipped them as neither of us knew what it meant. 

My advice would be skip the tutorial completely and just read the rules first and play a normal game. I understood everything much better by reading the rulebook first. We were both left with a blah feeling with the tutorial method. We ended up nowhere near finishing even one trait amd the tutorial doesn’t even give you a satisfying ending. A big time investment but not really feeling like we played the game. Will give it another chance. Hopefully it gets better. The big problem is that this game was supposed to impress my wife, who is not a big gamer, and I think she found my regular Euro style games more entertaining.

Update:  after the boring tutorial experience we have not been able to muster the enthusiasm to play a full game.  I have watched play Throughs of this game where the people are making jokes left and right and totally getting into it. Any entertainment you get out of this game depends entirely on the two people playing ,  otherwise there is no game .  If you can’t role play, then don’t bother.  Another problem with the game is that it is very difficult to separate your own feeling or reaction to a question with those of the character. The game is very innovative, but it’s definitely a love it or hate it type of game.  There is also very limited replayability.  How many times do you want to answer the same ‘First visit to Ikea’ card that you have already answered in the previous games?

But only RPGers will get the most out of this game. The first scenario is pretty devoid of interesting decisions.... maybe a later one would be more interesting........ Also, it's not very interactive -- at least insofar as, usually, I don't really care whether you win or lose..

As a game, it's just not very good. Despite being stuck in development for an extra 2 yrs after the KS, there's a lot that's still confusing and not clear. At the end of the days, it's not very engaging thematically, or with the other player. 

I just didn't care enough to finish it the last time we played. Not a good sign.

I was really excited about this, and I want to play it again, but some of the results of some of the actions were counter-intuitive. That being said, I do like a game where my character ends up pregnant and a fair amount less in love with her partner than vice versa. I'd like to try it again.

It's a strange crossover between roleplaying and these old primary school "flirt" cards you used to "chat" with girls.

This is a very novel theme, and it is has some very unique ways to bring it out. However, I really disliked it.

Just received and unboxed.   What a truly beautiful package.   Thank you to the designer for bringing to our boardgame world a unique game which addresses a subject seldom seen in boardgames. In a world where entertainment generally involves murder, horror, enemies, evil, physical violence, crime, war and the more sordid side of human behaviour it is refreshing to see a game that breaks this mold.  My partner does not play boardgames,  she is just not stimulated by them like us geeks. However, their is a chance, a slim one at that, that she may actually enjoy this.  Now that would be something exceptional.  It's really not fair to the rating system to rate this game without playing it first,  but I'm making an exception. A designer that brings new and innovative ideas to the table, and dares go where others fear to tread makes this hobby exciting, interesting and fresh for me.  As a wargamer, the fog of war has dominated my gaming table.  Maybe this will bring balance back to the force. It's a 9 for all of the above,  and you should know by now what would make this a 10.

When played with the right mindset, this game is amazing. It does a great job of simulating the ups and downs of relationships - how some people may be looking for different things, or are just incompatible. Or how seemingly mismatched people can still make things work. It's very similar to a role-playing game - you should expect to get a good story out of it, and not worry too much about winning.

RATING: 7
I feel really mixed about this one. I can see there is a good game in there, but it really does need both players to a) be in a relationship and b) be willing to add an element of role-play. Some cards require you to tell a story, and when creating characters, it's a lot more fun if you put some thought and effort into who you are. My partner is a non-gamer, and has never played any form of rpg or storytelling game and so really couldn't see the point in making up a story about a fictitious character for the benefit of a 1 hour gaming experience. I could tell she wasn't enjoying it, and doubt she'll be willing to play again.

Amazing. I am not a role player but I enjoyed acting out the characters that we made up while playing this game. Somehow over the course of the game you feel invested in the triumphs and/or failures that their relationships go through, leaving a lasting impression. Although I’ll probably not break it out very often, the experiences you create with someone else who’s also into the drama and roleplaying of the game is one of a kind. Most innovative game of 2017 imho.

Honestly, I'm not sure what to think yet.  My wife likes it more than I do (that's rare).  We've played it three times.  I found the tutorial helpful, but also mildly confusing and lackluster.  I love the freedom to create my character and build moments in the relationship.  However, I also felt there were unnecessary and confusing restrictions placed on this freedom.  The stories were fun, but also felt a bit chaotic and lacking in flow.  The rules were simple, but for some reason a little distracting.  Now... the quality is superb.  Without question, one of the nicest games I own and I've played a lot and owned a lot.  So... I'm still waiting for that killer moment.  Thus far Time Stories still wins for shining moments.  This one is beautiful in its ability to bring my wife into the fold.

Light role playing about being in a relationship. Sometimes your goals conflict and you need to choose what to do. Make sure to view it humorously and not as an emulation!

In this whirlwind review, I chart the highs and lows of my relationship with Fog of Love. Will we stay together? Drift apart? Throw things and make the neighbors call the cops?

More seriously, Fog of Love makes a bold attempt at being a romantic comedy generator, and pulls off a number of its goals unexpectedly smoothly. Unfortunately, its repetitiveness and insistence on certain overly gamey systems prevent it from reaching its full potential.

I've never played any game with a theme quite like this one, and the BGG description makes it sound pretty intriguing.

This game is great!  I first started looking into this game because I thought this would be a game my nongamer girlfriend would like. After reading more about it I decided to Kickstart it.  The final product blew me away.  Complaint number one I get from my girlfriend is she doesn't enjoy the learning curve of a new game.  She wants it to be like a video game where you can just jump in and learn as you play.  This game does that perfectly.  It is the best way to learn a new game and I wish more games did this.  We jumped into the first game and read the tutorial cards as they came up.  The components are also beautiful and looks great on the table.  The rest of the game is very fun and the mechanics are easy to learn.  I think my favorite part was how we roleplayed our characters and before we played a card we would talk about the scenario that led to this card.  I think roleplaying is VERY important to play this properly.  Otherwise you lose out on a lot of the game.  Overall, super fun and I can't wait to play it more!

This game gave me a headache, just like a real relationship. 


Most beautifully constructed game ever - just super boring.

There is no doubt that this game is innovative. And as far as presentation goes, it is by far one of the most polished that I've come across. However, I feel that the game selling itself as a romantic comedy generator/role playing game was quite misleading. Encounters feel very disjointed - one minute you're asked to choose where you want to go on your first date, and the next you're picking furniture. It doesn't feel like you're playing through a coherent story as much as you're responding to this weird montage of a romance. As such, it makes it difficult to roleplay a character in what feels like such a disjointed narrative.

If you're looking for something to engage a friend or girlfriend who has no interest in tabletop gaming, then this might be a good gateway game for people like that. But as far as storytelling engines go, there are far more interesting and streamlined systems out there.

Hmmm... A sort of lite role-playing game, there is actually not that much game in it and it runs pretty long for what it is. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't really like it either. Not sure what my feelings about it are, I just thought it was "meh", unfortunately.

Romantic comedy relationship sim. Two-player storytelling strategic deduction. Each chapter from the first kiss, maybe a sortid affair(?), to raising children, and hopefully the golden years. Each partner has random traits (e.g. Prudish, stunt pilot). The trick is to deduce how the partners will answer story telling situations Newly Wed Game style, or simultaneous reveal combo answers. I don't know if the game allows but it should consider the opportunity to select same gender partners at setup.

I really had high hopes for this. A game that tell the story of a relationship. Bur it fell flat for me. you awnser trivia questions with relationsship theme not as yourself but as the character you created. Not much storytelling and the strategy game part alone does not carry this game.

I don't need any more 2-player games in my collection ever, but at least someone is doing something interesting.  Would be willing to play.

Also love the graphic design.

Very different. Great role playing experience, but you need two people who want to role play. This doesn't feel much like a game, it's not really co-operative and it isn't competitive. There are no "winners" in the sense of what you expect in a boxed board game sense. I honestly think this entry needs to be moved over to RPG Geek.

The tutorial for this is amazing. There are a lot of fiddly bits about the cards and playing the tutorial really eases you into the roleplaying system better than the light-weight and lackluster rulebook that is attached with this game. But as much as I like the tutorial, that rulebook is horrible for referencing the rules and drags any enjoyment down. For example, when we got hung up on a rule, we tried looking it up in the rulebook, but couldn't find it referenced anywhere near the card we were looking at. We ended up flipping through all the tutorial cards until we found the right one with the answer.

I don't know how long this is going to last in the "want to play" column. There is fun here, and my partner and I enjoy it so far. But the replay-ability of this is concerning. Even after two games, some of the same cards that would come up felt repetitive and boring.

I did some playtesting on this game. The game was a bit rougth back then, but I can see that Jacob has streamlined it a lot since and even implimented one of my ideas - so that's cool. I wish him the best of luck the game. I haven't played the final version.

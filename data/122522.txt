Smash up is the best of both worlds. It's a deckbuilder that doesn't require any thought in how to build your deck. It's a "take that" game that stays well balanced throughout many expansions. The only thing that this game needs is a randomizer for picking factions. Other than that, and the fiddly power modifier tokens, it's damn near perfect. It teaches fast, and can play 2 or 4 easily. I've even played 6 player battles (although, they stretched everyone's patience by the end). I will say, some cards and timing are poorly worded and/or fiddly, leading to the loudest player getting their wish. I rarely can play this game without looking up a rule/combo issue on BGG. Other than that, I really enjoy this game - and have yet to meet an expansion faction I didn't come to love.

Well, it's fun, but there's not much too it.  The real entertainment value is in thinking about the images and thinking up the smack talk afforded by mashing up otherwise cliched genres.

[I]tl;dr When Smash Up is firing on all cylinders, it's a quick-playing competition/cooperation game that revolves around the special abilities that all these wacky card combos can create. When you really do know what you're doing, this produces a very enjoyable experience that plays in just under an hour and produces a lot of laughs all around.[/I]

[b]Read the full review [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/24594456]here[/url].[/b]

What can I say? SmashUp is one of my top games. I've found SmashUp to be a great "gateway" game that really stretches people and gets them interested in board games. The fact that there's a million factions to choose from means that people generally can end up with something that looks interesting to them. 

The game holds up well, with good replayability and variety, especially as you add on further expansions and factions. Most factions don't change the rules at all, but offer you more choices of special abilities and card powers that will give you an edge against other players. 

In SmashUp, the basic concept is that you pick two factions: say, Alien-Horses or Super Spy-Dinosaurs, and mash them together to create a 40-card deck of unique ability. This is a shuffle-building game, not a collectible card game, so no player is disadvantaged by not having rare, powerful cards. Instead, everyone gets a level playing field as they draft two factions from the same pool. 

Once chosen, players compete to score points on bases by playing both minions and actions. Minions give you power at a certain base, and actions manipulate bases, minions, and other players. The first player to 15 victory points wins the game! 

Generally, folks who like serious, engine-building games won't be a fan of this sort of game (although personally, I appreciate both types). SmashUp is silly, madcap, and crazy, and the cards are often cartoony or filled with jokes. But as a mid-casual gamer, I really enjoy the mechanic of choosing a good combination and crushing the competition. 

SmashUp is always a favorite at our game nights and we haven't come close to using up all the possible combinations (though one poor guy has a knack for the worst combos: hello Cyborg Ape-Time Travellers!)

I recommend SmashUp simply because it's rollicking good fun with a lot of variety. Originally, I wanted to add every expansion all at once, but have realized that a huge part of the metagame of Smash Up comes with knowledge -- knowing what your opponents pick, how those decks work, and how to counter them. As such, we've slowly added back expansions, after selling off a ton about a year ago.

Yeah, there is a lot of rules lawyering, but the FAQ deals with most of it and you can house rule stuff, if necessary.  Tons of replayability.  We always do random draws of factions, just to see if we can win with any combo.  Great fun.

RATING: 5
A well thought idea with a bit awkward execution. I really enjoyed choosing factions to create my own unique draw deck. The asymmetrical setup makes the game much more interesting and adds longevity, I reckon. The art is a bit childish but works. Figuring out the best way to play your hand and creating combos is fun, BUT the very same part is the downfall of Smash Up as well. You simply have too many cards in your hand and there are too many things going on the table in parallel which forms a too vast of an option space for a game that should be played at a very fast pace. Sure you can throw cards casually without giving your moves much of a thought but you would miss the point of the game entirely. There is an easy fix to the problem, i.e., reduce the hand limit by half and remove some of the point cards fought over from the table, but I must admit that this might cause some balance issues if you just keep drawing wrong types of cards.
 
But anyways, Smash Up offers enough fun to justify its existence despite the rough edges.

Just not very much fun;  the idea is interesting, the rulebook is very well-written....I think it suffers from the characteristic flaw of any card game:  Too much text.

All in all a good game. Some combos are kind of random and there's a lot of text to read and some things are slightly open to interpretation. But it's kind of fun just because of the combos (even if it's a bit unbalanced). Also, it helps if I win (getting 9 points on scoring one area is kind of ridiculous though, but fun). I would play again.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Smash Up is a goofy card game that I enjoyed. It's simple and it's fun to see crazy combos happen and twist everything on the board. I'm kinda ok with the fact that some combinations may be unbalanced, because I don't need perfect balance in a fun filler game like this.

The game doesn't stand out from the pack for me though. It has for sure a clever idea, but the gameplay is a little too chaotic for my taste.

I'd recommend getting expansions as well for further playability.

I have it a 5 for a few reasons. Some of which is a shortcoming in which I have not play this game more times.

It's very light for most gamers and is One of those simple math game where bigger is better. Interactions comes with various card effects and special action cards that does things to the game but essentially changes the values on cards that eventually assist in scoring.

There are other light cards games that plays similarly, this just provides multiple 'base' options instead of just fighting for 1.

Theme wise was really low as I did not really bother what faction I was playing, just trying to get cards to interact was more important.

Overall, a good gateway game, but not the kind of math game I was looking for.

Keeping track of the point totals at each location can be a bit of a pain for such a quick and simple game on the surface.

Luckily I can usually offload at least some of that to the other players.

I do not like this game. Its theme is attractive and the game-play is simple, but so dull it makes me physically ill. Every turn you play two cards, sometimes they help you but most of the time its because you've got nothing better. Then at the end of your turn you draw two cards. Super simple, incredibly boring. The downtime between player turns is way too long for a game that should take 40 minutes. I've played 6 or 7 games of this and 1.5 hour games are apparently pretty common, not just in my group but in others I have seen play. In that time I could play Core Worlds or 3 games of Dominion. I do not enjoy this game, some people will and that is fine, but personally I can't stand it.

What can I say? I love this game. I love the shuffle building idea. It works great. Can you get people playing who focus too much on combos extending turns? Sure. But that isn't how I like to play the game. For me, it's a "take that" game, foremost. It's easy to teach. Does it require reading. Sure does. I don't mind reading cards in a game. Maybe it comes from playing MtG. Does it have downtime? It can. Especially if you are playing with that guy going for every single combo possible. Just pick two factions and start playing!

Feels like it should be more of an introductory game than it is; I have stopped using it as a gateway game because it hasn't worked out.

The art will attract more people than the rules will keep interested.

I was very surprised by how much fun this game is for two players.  Even though I typically enjoy playing with larger groups, I think this is best 1v1.  We use a spinner to keep track of how close we are to breaking each base, which cuts down on the constant addition that can slow things down a bit.  The base set is a ton of fun and you absolutely don't need any expansions (although you will probably buy some anyway).  There's certainly power creep going on, as the pirates in the base set are by far the weakest group, but many of my favorite factions are in here.

The "shufflebuilding" game Smash Up starts with a simple premise: Take the twenty-card decks of two factions, shuffle them into a forty-card deck, then compete to smash more Bases than your opponents! Each faction brings a different game mechanism into play – pirates move cards, zombies bring cards back from the discard pile, dinosaurs have huge power – and every combination of factions brings a different play experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Smash definitely has a 'fun' factor about picking out two crazy factions and figuring out how to make their special abilities work to your advantage in taking bases. Its decisions can range from being somewhat shallow to a just a bit of depth. It's all very dependent on luck as you draw very few cards (sometimes you can't even take both your available main actions per turn because of it),

Everyone is flinging around silly and possibly broken powers every turn to completely change the state of the game. Worth a laugh and bit of thought, but not a ton more.

The game seems like a shoddy job. You can't release a game  like this. No victory chips, small letters in the bases and no bigger boards to put the players' cards on them.

RATING: 6.5
I've only played once. I'd seen it being played on TableTop and seen some reviews of the cards, and it seemed like a fairly light, silly game.

But it wasn't. It plays like Magic or something of that ilk. It's not a light game. You have to sit there and think and strategize based on your hand and the condition of the board. Not at all what I was expecting, but that's actually more to my taste than it would have been if it had been a light, silly game.

But I sense that there's a problem with that.

We were playing at 3 players, and it felt like with more players than that, the game would be a bit too long between turns. So I wouldn't want to play it 4 players. At 2 players, I'd rather play Magic since that has more interesting decks and mechanisms. So this is really limited to a 3 player game. I don't think I'd want to own a 3 player only game.

And, a thing with Magic is that deck "strength" is a pretty loose term. There are certainly decks that are clearly more powerful than your average pre-constructed pack, or what-have-you. But that doesn't mean that they will win against every other deck (being played by a competent player) of a weaker strength. Some decks are just inherently weak against certain things.

With Mashup, assuming that they have done a good job of balancing everything, it seems likely that all of the decks are on average of equal "strength". But I think that for any particular matchup, they're not going to be equal, because one will be weak to that particular style of play.

With Magic, you can buy duelling decks or construct decks that balance well against each other. With Mashup, unless you hunt up historical data, you're not going to know whether the decks you have in play are going to be competitive against each other. And since there's 3 of them in play, having them be competitive against both of the other 2 is going to be a pretty tall order.

Personally, I don't care about winning too much. I think I won the one game that I played, and I'd happily play it again. But I would probably have to recommend against buying this if you do care about winning as there might be some balance issues, unless you play lots of games across many pairings. And I would recommend against buying it unless you expect to be in a lot of 3-player situations.

I want to analyze how to win with each deck. I want to look at a game state and say, "this is the route to victory." but the game itself is not balanced. The Game itself is too random. It is a filler game that grew up too big and now is wasting my time.

Kinda silly cardgame with cute artwork. The game is easy to teach and play and setup takes almost no-time. There are a lot of take that momments. 8 factions are included and each player takes 2 of them and shuffles them together creating his deck. Each faction has its own flavor though. You are not really playing ninja-pirates, instead you are playing ninjas and pirates. I mean they dont mix up so well.
The game isn't that bad, but it didn't grab my attention.

Not a fan of this, it's swingy and while the theme is fun I just don't think there's very much to it. Lots of similar-weight games I'd rather play. I think this stands out mainly because of the (admittedly excellent) theme and graphic design.

I am madly in love with this game. May be the perfect gamer's filler. It would not be a filler for people that cannot quote the rules of stack from Magic like it was scripture, but for those of us who can, very light and perfect. I want new factions though. Badly. The idea that as shipped, all factions are represented in a four player game rubs me wrong way. Bring on Ninja Bears!

I enjoyed playing this game but it feels overly long when you're playing a game with players who aren't used to it. At the end of the day, the down time is quite high. There's plenty of waiting around while people read the text on their cards. I think there are better games out there.

Edit: this is a good game. You just have to be very careful about who you bring it out with. Slow players who won't roll with the punches and have a go at playing things quickly - guys prone to AP - will cause you problems with this one.

Simple and fun. Is a great game for people who like card games for the combos they can pull off from them (i.e. people who have played CCGs like magic and are looking to pull off cool moves with cards). The game is really easy to teach (1 minion, 1 action unless you do something special) and has a lot of really fun artwork that help to get people in the game. Can be a bit fiddly as there will be a lot of cards spread out on the board, so be sure to check out the really cool base mats in the files section. Overall, a very fun filler for people who aren't looking for something too heavy.

Smash Up at GenCon 2012 is the Quarriors of GenCon 2011.

Cool new mechanics (if you can call shuffle-building  mechanic), fun artwork, and enough interesting decisions for a single game play.

After the initial play of both of these games I was left extremely underwhelmed by the actual choices in the game.  Once you've learned your decks (it doesn't take long to figure out optimal play for each of the decks) it is then a matter of just drawing and playing cards.  Unfortunately, the fun theme and artwork can't make up for non-existent game play.

One of the best ideas for a game out there. Very good game of fun card combinations. Finding ways to maximize your points while minimizing the amount of work needed to place in the top three of a base is key.

Some combos are definitely overpowered, while others don't work at all, but that's understandable given the endless possibilities. The game can drag out a little longer than I'd like because there's a lot of reading to do to fully understand everyone's cards. Sometimes, you are unlucky and stuck with all actions and no minions and nothing good to play.

Like the simplicity, the shuffle-two deckbuilding, and the "point the cards toward yourself" board play.  Completely hate the downtime between turns, which can really get crazy with the right folks, even for such a beer & pretzels type of game.  Although that is player-dependent, the amount of card text and recalculation isn't.  Totally baffled that the copy I played had no numerical tracking at all, even for scores.

Wasn't sure I was going to love this, but after watching a lot of videos I decided to track it down and am very glad I did. It's a bit superficial in theme, like a card game competition of all those nerdy 'dinosaur vs. ninja vs. _ _ _ _ vs. _ _ _ _' memes, but once you get into it you can appreciate how the various decks function with the base scoring system. It's amazing, really.

I give this game a 10 because I'm super biased towards the game's thematic design. All of the factions are super fudgin cool and goofy. They also all play so completely differently from each other, and playing as two of them at a time makes the options for strategy far more open. It's super simple, I learned it in a turn. I feel it plays best 1v1 but 4 player ffa isn't bad. I have played this game pretty much everyday since I bought it. I've met no one who dislikes it.

For a game with such simple rules, this one does deliver a punch. Two punches, actually. The mixing of two factions feels very well integrated with the game, and there is a lot of room to take interesting decisions and build up combos.

The first times you play it, gameplay might be a bit slow while players get used to their cards. But once you know how to play it, it also plays quite fast.

I'm wishing to buy some expansions for this already!

Cool factions. Nice entry game. Bit AP prone.
Random goodness.

Maybe a bit too long?

Also with 2 players the winner can be predicted after only a few bases. (maybe only 1st player on the base should get score?)

Use something to count each player's score on the bases as alway having to count can suck (I use the point markers that come in ALL the boxes :) )

the game is a very dull take on tug of war.
You shuffle two themes together to make a deck of cards to play a game similar to battle line or schotten totten.  Player with highest strength gets the location.  Some cards have special abilities, but they really don't make the game any more interesting.

Very boring and I regret playing it.

Good fun to be had here.

Luckily enough, I bought the base game together with the Awesome Level expansion so more option for me..goodie me. Easily can replace light games like King of Tokyo for crowds that do not prefer dice to cards or more strategy-prone people.

Initial Impression: I love the simplicity of this game. Each faction plays differently and modifies the game mechanisms in thematic ways. Mixing 2 different factions into one deck makes for alot of variability in the play. Add to that the variable battlegrounds and you're in for tons of replay ability. The mechanisms of the game are similar to Bloodbowl Team Manager, Battleline, or Omen: Reign of War in the sense that you will deploy your units to various battlefields in the hopes of gaining a majority. Deploying the units will trigger various effects, which is where much of the fun occurs. Games don't last too long and it seems that its a close race in the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5

This game is okay, but with most people I play with, the game moves at a much slower pace that would be appropriate for a much more strategic game.  It has some dissonance for me because the mechanics are so simple, the theme so silly, but it seems to grind to a halt for AP-inclined people.  I really want to like it more, but I never feel compelled to bring it out these days.

Men trekt 2 volkeren waarmee men speelt.  Men legt één minion aan, aan een base, en daarna één actie.  
Op zich een leuk concept.

Minpunten:
- Je hebt totaal geen overzicht over wie in welke base het beste scoort.  
- Op veel kaarten staan specials, extra acties, en je houdt echt geen overzicht wie wat kan.  
Je gelooft de andere gewoon.

Wife score: 7.5. Great mix of factions. Very interesting to see how each faction works with the others. Can't wait for expansions to add more factions to the 8 already there. Game length can vary depending on the players. Played as short as 40 mins and as long as 2 hours. Great filler game in between longer games.

Was recently reminded of the fun factor of this game when I replayed it. Really neat, MTG-esque strategy, but in a much quicker, lighter, less collectible package. VERY fun to experiment with the powers of different factions. Own the "Science Fiction Double Feature" expansion.

Got it as a gift but had it on my radar after watching a Tabletop episode. That show made me a little leery of the wizard faction and how it can induce AP in what should be a fast play-through. 

Grabbed one expansion to help fill out the base game slots.

RATING: 8.5
Great fun game for the geek audience, everyone has thought about playing with zombie-ninjas, robot-pirates and wizard-dinosaurs etc. and here you can do battle with these weird combinations against each others. Playing this ones makes you want to try more and more combinations and buy more expansions for even more combinations. So this is very addictive game, but unfortunatelly for only 3-4 players. The gameplay itself somehow reminds MtG(multiplayer) in a very good way, playing combos and attacking others. I really enjoy this.

This is a really fun game for everyone.  My mother, of all people, loves to play this game.  This is one of the very few games that I desire to play two games in one sitting, for everytime I play, I want to try out a different faction combo after I finish a game.  I do not purchase many expansions, but I will be obtaining Smash Up's expansions when available.

A common notion about the game is that is does not play well with two.  I disagree.  With two, the game feels more strategic, since a player has more control over the flow of the game.  The benefits of good combos used are readily apparent.

There's a lot of cool stuff going on here, but I don't find the "base breaking" aspect of the game to be particularly strong. Obviously that's a big part of its design and it sets it apart from a lot of similar card based games, but its a little dry. The "shufflebuilding" is great and throws up a lot of interesting plays and combos, but I think I'd like it better if the interactions were a little more direct.

Only downside is adding up multiple bases takes away from the action a bit. Some turns can take very long. Prefer playing the game with 3 bases, regardless of player count.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, lightweight meme-fest with lively graphics and just enough tactical depth to make the various deck combinations (Zombie pirates!  Robot dinosaurs!  Ninja wizards!) strategically interesting.

If anything, it's a tad TOO simple for its own good, and the mechanic of adding up the strength of all the minions assaulting a base to smash it can feel clunky.  Would be much more satisfying if it were just a bit deeper.  But it's a fun little devil just the same.

I really enjoy this game. The basic rules are easy to remember and very simple to teach other players but different card combinations bring diversity in the game. However, new players have a great disadvantage since they are not familiar with the decks and useful card combinations.

I have played this mostly with two players and find it interesting to investigate which factions work well against other factions. Before I bought any of the expansions I had played (games with) all possible faction combinations in this base game, and I have to say that 8 factions is not enough; it's good for about 20 to 30 games, after that you probably want new factions.

RATING: 3
Zombie-Ninjas sound like fun, right? How about Robot-Dinosaurs, or Pirate-Wizards? The concept is interesting as you try to blend the talents of 2 different geeky factions in order to conquer different geeky locations. When I read the rules I was psyched because it sounded light, fast and fun too. Unfortunately, when we played it didn't meet those expectations. While the rules are simple, the card effects and base effects just make things confusing. With a group of gamers this would probably all be second nature, but with non-gamers it quickly gets overwhelming (particularly because of the fact that different cards can be played at different moments in the game.) Then there's the constant adding up of cards and modifiers to check if locations are complete each turn. Finally, my OCD goes into overdrive with these games where there is no logical place to play all the cards. Ideally you want to read all the abilities/values of all the cards splayed off all 4 sides of all 4 bases, but this causes one row to run into another, and it just drives me batty. With all these little issues it just ends up being tedious rather than fun. If all the players had a level of familiarity with the cards it would flow, and be fast. I can see that potential in the system, but I'm not sure I have the right group to get there.

Smash Up, as the name implies, sees players taking two unique factions, represented by small decks of minions and spells, and shuffling them together to make their own personal deck. With a witty and goofy theme to it, this can range from awesome (robot dinosaurs) to ridiculous (shark princesses). The base game is decent but the fun really comes out from getting the expansions that tickle your fancy. 

The gameplay is fairly simple, try to have area majority on locations, using minions, once their point limit is reached to score the most, and use the spells to further your cause in other ways. Perhaps some faction combinations are really too powerful to be countered, but for the most part the game is incredibly well balanced.

My only 2 complaints with the game are really one connected one. Keeping track of everything on each location, with special powers taken into consideration can be very hard to manage, and min-max types of players should be avoided because of this. With that being said, the game works best at 3 players, 2 can often become, who's deck combo is a bit better, and with 4 it's just too much to keep track of and too much downtime.

It’s refreshing to see that once in a while a card game such as Smash Up pops up and brings in something innovative: in fact by simply combining the game’s differently flavored and powered factions you keep finding all-new ways to trouble your opponents and hamper their playing while having a good time yourself, which translates in very rewarding games even when you lose.

Well, maybe it isn’t as innovative but it’s a pleasant turn from the typical deck builders that lately did overrun the card games genre.

I gotta say that this dumb card game has wriggled its way into my heart over the years.  The more I play the more impressed I am by how the cards interact and meld with one another.  Smashing two decks together to see what happens is enjoyable and so is trying to really overthink combos.  This game is a winner and I'm still looking forward to new factions and expansions.

This could become a favorite of mine if I could get it played more often. All the different factions make it a bit tough to learn well, but it can be very entertaining. I did't find this great 2 player and 4 player can be a bit long. There tends to be one person who really slows down the flow in a 4 player game so it's probably an issue with them more than the player count.

This is a good concept, and the presentation and art is appealing. The factions are good and varied enough to keep things interesting. but it doesn't really offer anything new and I admit to being a little disappointed. I was not convinced by the objective scoring mechanism, not sure what the alternative might be, but it turned out a little dull when we played. perhaps this will get better with more plays and knowledge of the decks, but for me there are too many other card games with more appeal right now.

This game has some wording that can be a little vague.  A couple of my people in my main group found that to be frustrating as some cards contradicted one another and the rule book did not state how to deal with that.  Unfortunately I don't how many times this will make it back to the table with my friends.

**Update** This was a 7.5 I am dropping it to a solid 5.  I think this game could be great but you would have to play it a lot...I mean a lot pretty much with the same people to figure out the strategy of each faction and to keep track of what each base does and what each card does.  There is a lot of reading cards and bases and turns seem to take entirely too long.  Like I said this would all change the more you play with the same people but I don't see this making back to my gaming table very often.  I really wanted to love this game and maybe that is where I got my hopes too high.  I have purchased many games in my short time in this hobby and this is probably my biggest regret.  I wish I had played it before purchasing it.

Hasn't made the table in a few years.  Too long, card text constantly conflicts with other cards that leads to "what does this card do again? does it beat your card?" The rules section "Void Where Prohibited" that is suppose to help resolve card conflicts is garbage and downright confusing and drags down the game.  Moreover, the bases don't have counters to mark base point totals, more time spent adding and re-adding.  Total dud at our gaming group and one of the most overrated, popular games on BGG.  Neat theme and concept I guess, but poor mechanics, rules, gametime, and execution.

I like the theme and the core idea of the game (building themes with very odd combinations) but there's too much text in the cards for the game to be fun to play. It's very hard to keep track of the situation and combos of other players since it's all written on the cards.

And the box gave a hint that there's going to be expansions for the game which makes it even harder to play the game.

Not my kind of a game but I can see why some will love it.

Before reading further on, I'd like to emphasize on the fact that I completely adore this game.
At the same time, I know that people read reviews to get a good impression of what is good/bad about the particular game. Thus, both the comment and the review will be critical ones. 

The good:
   The mechanism. I understand that the idea of a simple mechanism with complexity coming from the components is somewhat frustrating to a handful of players, however, I have never had a problem with that. 
   The artwork. 
   The references. 

The bad:
   No components are provided for keeping track of the scoring. Of course, no one banned the old pen/paper duo and the problem was resolved with the first expansion. At the same time, when you buy a game, you expect to get everything one needs in order to start playing. The little 

The ugly:
   The chemistry between factions. A major flaw of the game is the fact that not all faction work great together. This might harm the first impression for new players, specially if there is no one experienced to help them pick out the factions. I am calling major flaw on this one because I do not see how it could be prevented with any kind of modifications.

In conclusion, while Smash Up is not the next Carcassonne of the board gaming community, it is capable of forming its own dedicated fanbase thanks to its outstanding pros.

I'm trying very hard to break my habit of rating things at a 7.

While I think this game has the potential to be a great game, it was certainly a hit with my gaming group, I also feel that it needs a few more races. Its alot of fun to pick your combination if your the first or second player, not so muchc if you end up going last. Still this is an ammusing game. After all, who doesn't want to be a Pirate Alien?

Update - 2/26/2013

While I still find this game fun it's not aging well. I really feel that AEG needs to put out expansions for this game much quicker then they are. They need to keep it fresh or its going to wind up in storage, out of sight out of mind...

I like this game. It provides a lot of choices on a player's turn, and seems like it would appeal to light gamers as well as veteran gamers. 

There's a satisfaction in setting up and executing a brutal card combo, and equally satisfying to shatter the setups of opponents. 

This is definitely a "take that" type of game where it's in the best interest of the players to focus on attacking the leader. So the outcome can be quite unpredictable, and I'm not sure how much of a role experience plays in improving your game, but it is good fun.

RATING: 7
Smash Up plays a lot like a chaotic version of Battle Line/Schotten Totten, if you know either of those games.

If you don't know either of those games, in Smash Up, you're playing cards to bases.  When the number of cards at a base reaches a certain level, the base scores, giving players points for having cards there.  You ideally want more points at a base than the other players.  Once you score a certain number of points, you win.

The fun is in all of the special abilities of the cards, and how those special abilities can interact.  The base game comes with 8 races of cards, like robots, dinosaurs, pirates, ninjas, zombies, etc.  Each of these races has a different deck of cards with different special abilities.  At the beginning of the game, you take two races and shuffle them together to create your deck.  So, one game you might be playing with an army of pirates and zombies, and the next game you might get dinosaurs and aliens.  So, each game will play differently for you depending on the race combination you get.

The bases are also all different, and each have their own special ability either when you add a card to a base, or when the base scores, etc.  The different base abilities can also interact with the deck abilities in different (and sometimes wacky) ways!

Overall, a neat little game.  Pretty beer & pretzel weight.  My only caution is that I'll probably exclusively play it as a three player game.  It gets really chaotic with four, and the downtime can get to be a bit much if the card combos start getting really wacky.  Other than that, good stuff!

I played in a four-player game of Smash Up at TactiCon 2012 in Denver. Having heard about the buzz from GenCon, I was eager to give it a go.

My deck was the Alien Dinosaurs, and I saw more of the alien cards in my play-through. The game took a while because it was new to three out of the four of us.

I love the theme - how can you not? The mechanics, though, didn't really do it for me. It was a little boring when the Robot Wizard player had these complex, drawn-out turns, drawing and playing tons of cards, while my turns were very quick - drop a creature, play an action, done. 

The game didn't feel unbalanced; the final score was 15-11-11-8, so it wasn't a blowout (and the long-turn player actually finished in last place). The problem was that it just wasn't much fun. I was looking for a way to just make it end rather than to win. That's not a good sign!

Awesome theme, great art, so-so game play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

There's so much in this game that I hate in principle, but taken as a whole it's more enjoyable than the sum of its parts.

I think that all speaks to how well the decks are designed. There's lots of fun little synergies that just feel good to pull off. 

That said, since you start with complete decks it is nowhere near as satisfying as any game where you build your combinations as you play (deckbuilding games, or something like San Juan or hell, getting into board games, even stuff like Last Will). There's no greater strategy other than hoping you draw the right cards. 

For that reason, Smash Up strikes me as something that might make a good intro to the whole combo-building mechanic. For seasoned players, though, Smash Up doesn't have much to offer.

Fair warning also: I can see a real potential for this game to drag. Like many content-driven games you wind up drawing a bunch of cards (inevitably, sometimes, during your turn) and have to spend awhile reading through all of them and figuring out what to do with 'em. Nearly every turn for us started with "uhh wait hang on I'm still figuring this out". If you're going to play a lot with the same decks the problem will eventually sort itself out, but in the interim be prepared for some waiting.

This isn't a terrible game. Each faction has a unique feel, the text isn't too onerous to read or understand, it plays quickly, and is kinda fun. There also weren't any rules ambiguities when cards clashed, which is unusual (and nice) for this type of game. 

It is very chaotic, some of the combo powers are very powerful (overpowered?) and I don't love this kind of game in general, so it only goes so far with me.

Might be how it was taught. Might be because we played an 8 player game with expansions as our first game. I and most of the rest of the players found it completely unenjoysble. The first few rounds we were still confused about what the goal was and how to achieve it. Once I'd figured out the basics of how it worked, I started getting lost in the overabundance of card text.

Come to discover later that the game isn't intended to be stretched to 8 players, even with any supplements. For the record, the person teaching us set the group up with four bases that eight players fought over, without knowing how to play. Did not work. Maybe deserves a second try with 3-4 players, but I'm still not sure it's my cup of tea.

Oh. It's just an overcomplicated version of Loot. Should have told me that before we started playing. Derp.

My wife really likes this game; I am less enthusiastic. The art is silly and cards are too. I like the theme, generally. In practice, the gameplay feels too slow and stunted, since you can only do two things each turn. Building armies is mostly slow and plodding, and killing armies can be quick and demoralizing. I find most games to be unbalanced, with some deck combos being far better than others. Also, there is something anticlimactic about the winning of bases; you just get a higher number and then take it. There's no battle, really.

I traded for Smash Up looking for a great lunchtime filler game. And, after one play, I'd say it delivers exactly as I hoped. Easily playable within an hour, with a theme that is lighthearted and absurd, and tons of replayability based on all the potential pairings.

It's one of those games where the core rules are simple but the complexity and tension stems from all the different card powers and abilities. It does add some complexity as players try to figure out the options... all varying based on their hand of cards. But I suspect it gets smoother with familiarity.

Probably not for those groups that balk at "take that" card games, but for a quick card game with interesting choices, this looks like a solid bet.

The game mechanics are whacky and chaotic, usually in a positive way, and there is something especially fun about creating a faction combination. It's neither a very strategic game, nor a very casual one, but it is a great choice if you're in the right mood for it. I also have to comment on how impressed I am that there are this many factions and faction or combination seems to be excessively more or less powerful than another. A lot of work was clearly put into balancing this game.
I'd definitely recommend getting at least one expansion for it though, especially if you want to play with the maximum number of players (just a couple more factions will add a lot more variety).

Like a deckbuilder minus the deckbuilding -- you get all of the cards of two factions (selected at random, though I suppose you could do a snake-draft to make this a bit more weighty of a choice) at once. So basically Dominion without the most interesting part of Dominion. Gameplay is basically take-that with a bit of area-majority.

OK, so if you [i]need[/i] a game that crams the maximum number of geek-cult references into the smallest possible space and time, this is the superior alternative to Munchkin or Fluxx. A headcold is also the superior alternative to pneumonia or whooping cough.

The box is filled with small decks themed around different "clans," and you pick any two to shuffle together. Our first battles pitched Zombie Wizards vs Robotic Dinosaurs, along with Ninja Pirates vs Alien Leprechauns. Each side brings something unique to the table (the zombies bring back cards from the discard, the wizards can look at their future draws) and the combinations, while not always the most effective, are always fun. Laughs the first few games, but then the musing on strategies sets in. Expansions offer more clans, and the original box here has the space to accomodate all future purchases.

RATING: 4.5
The game is simple. It could have originated from classic playing cards. The mathiness, while simple, gets in the way.

Randomly selecting two factions often leads to unbalanced plays. It is common for one player to have highly active turns and the other do the equivalent to pass-go.

The art is good/passable, so is the humor

I fail to see the theme in this overrated card game. It's not an all out brawl like King of Tokyo, it's more or less just putting cards to block other cards on locations and the "fights" more or less accomplish nothing but lengthen the game. Only appeal is the geek fan of archetype pandering.

We have tried to play a few times and it just seems overwhelming for the kids.  Too many things can alter too many cards and it gets confusing.  While fun, and really a pretty game due to the artwork, it doesn't rank for us as high as other games and we seldom go to this one as a "go to" must play like we do with Splendor, Ticket to Ride, and Survive:Atlantis.

I really wanted to like this game, but...

It doesnt do for me what i wanted it to be: A not too complicated "action paced" card game. The name "Smash Up" suggested some action to me, maybe i didnt inform myself well enough beforehand. However, playtime gets too long for me with several players. Game concept is too boring for me for the lenght of play. If you play with 2 players it might be ok, but for me, there are better 2p games...

With several players i found it hard to play to your strategy because it was too hard to time destroying a base with like 3 people having turns after you. Nobody will prepare it for you for an easy catch. Thats the main reason for me it feels boring: you have to play nice combos in order to get a base within the game limitations (one monster, one action).

Cards have alot of text and it is hard to keep track of all the bases HP, players Victory points and with several players in game: all the effects that might trigger on  permanent cards. Which it makes it feel its a game for heavy gamers while i felt it should be a light game cause of the "light" rules.

Overall that makes the game too chewy for me.

Personal Summary:
--------
Pros: Overall Theme and general game idea, Artwork, travel size
Cons: Balance Issues depending on faction combos, too long, too less action, too much to keep track off for this type of game.

Easy to pick up and learn while also having a good level of strategy. The factions are well themed and each has a distinct play style. I love the ridiculous awesomeness of the factions as well, especially when paired together in a deck while playing. My only minor complaint would be the lack of counters for Victory Points in the base game, but if you like the game enough to get an expansion (or two, or... six) you will get counters for this purpose with it.

So many combinations of powers and a ton of expansions along with so many bases having so many different effects keeps this game endlessly replayable.  At times there can almost be too much going on with so many bases in play that area becomes a bit of an issue and the game itself may run on a bit long because of this, but it's still a lot of fun.

RATING: 6
It's a different take on card game, where you fight for the bases, rather than score points for the actual cards. But I found it can drag a little. You can get very picked on, and end up having none of your people on the table. Also certain decks work so well together, it's very hard to oppose them. But then the choosing mechanic is quite good.

RATING: 7
I like Smash Up more than I should.  It's a silly game, but that's what I love about it.  Who wouldn't love fielding a team of Zombie Dinosaurs or Pirate Wizards?  The game is a bit counting heavy.  There's not tons of depth, but playing with unique combinations of cards is fun.  I think buying a few expansions are necessary to get the full experience of the game.

A fun, battle-type card game where you play minions at locations to score points them (area majority-ish).  Most minions also have built-in actions.  Separate action cards let you do any number of things from playing additional minions, to shuffling discards back to your deck, to building wild card combos.  I love the fact that you always use 2 different factions together.  Brilliant!
P.S. - This is NOT a filler game.

This game is conceptually and thematically awesome, game play  aside.

RATING: 6
Okay so you get factions which may or may not work well together. It is a fast playing "take that" game with nice art. Replayability shouldn't be much of a problem since you get two of the factions and they interaction in fun ways. The expansion will write themselves so expect to add some fun factions later.

I Plays like a fun and Light-Hearted Variant of Magic: The Gathering.

The Shuffle-Building Mechanics is the best thing since Sliced Bread

Some of the factions are little better than others *Cough!' Robots, Elder Things, Zombies *Cough* - But that is to be expected. With 30+ factions some has to be the best and some have to be the not best.

The rules are pretty simple here - play an action and play a minion card.  If one of the base cards has enough minion points to hit its target, then it scores, and points go out to the top 3 players at that base.

One of the real problems here is the complete luck of the draw - even the best cards are worthless if you get them at the wrong time.  Or that turn when you have a lot of actions and not a single minion?  Rats.

While I like the art, humor and themes used in this game, the high degree of luck can be a real drag.  I'll play it again, but not a game I need to own.

We're big fans of Guillotine and Unexploded Cow, but this game by the same designer fell flat. 
The biggest problem is information overload (so many cards each with different abilities); the need to calculate/recalulate all the time is a big pain. Seems like this is the cardboard version of a solid tablet game.

The concept, theme, and prodution are remarkable. The core mechanism is an overly familiar place-the-minions-on-the-bases area influence design. A recent game that did this a lot better is Blood Bowl Team Manager (although Smash Up scales better to a wider range of player numbers). An old game that did this in a more clever way is FFG's Orcz.

Fun card game, although bordering on the too simple for my tastes. Ultimately its a draw 2, play 2 (if you can), but the interaction among the themes and the fun around our games table makes it better than the sum of its parts. Plus zombies are just a blast to play. Expansion helps with more variety, if you like the base game give an expansion a shot.

Smash up is a fun game of combos and modifiers.  There are many ways to attack bases that change based on the pair of factions you have that game.
There is a lot of card reading until you get familiar with the game.
We played with 6 players & it played well...but it was tough to keep track of each unique base & the specific minions/actions going in at them all.
The next play was with 4 players, and it was hard to make progress to the point where the game got stagnant.
I think there are too many bases with the official rules.  Less bases would keep the confusion down, and encourage more action & faster base busting.

A neat idea but the scoring on bases can be unnecessarily confusing for what should be a light, fast game. As is the fun tends to end shortly after choosing your card set.

Way too long for what it should be. It seems like a fast and furious card game but ends up being prone to AP and boredom. Terribly imbalanced and it takes experienced players drafting decks to balance itself.

Game is fun but more often than anything else someone is stuck with completely useless cards and it ruins the fun.

This is my favorite game on my shelf!  I play Smash Up as often as I can and it's usually the most requested game that I own.  I haven't played with anyone who didn't enjoy themselves.

Let me explain something.  I've probably played close to fifty or sixty games of Smash Up, I have won 4 of them.  I don't care because I always enjoy playing this.  The number of combinations of factions is amazing and only getting bigger as they release more expansions.  My only qualm with Smash Up is the Obligatory Cthulu set.  Other than that, this game is fantastic and I recommend that everyone at least play it once.

This game, as basic game, falls fairly empty. Per se it's not a bad game. The combos are nice, the artwork is really nice and the concept is not bad.
Said so I personally didn't like the game at all with 2 players. It was not fun for me.
Three players is acceptable while 4 is the only really way to play even though the game becomes fairly longer based on speed of the players.
To me it's a purely 3-4 players game but not good enough to take the place of other games falling in the same player range.

This game is awful.  Re-reading a table full of cards, doing basic arithmetic, and then finally playing a card that does nothing but prolongs the game is not my idea of fun.  The idea of mashed up factions is good, the art is great, the mechanics are a steaming pile.  Jones theory: Seasons.

Really dreadful, unfortunately.  I loved the idea of mixing faction cards to create a super team.  But the game play itself was dumb as hell: mostly a whole lot of take that and no progress being made toward the goals.  And perhaps the worst of all sins, the game was just slow and drug on and on.

The concept is cool...mixing up factions with a variety of abilities to earn the most victory points at different locations, however, it seems a bit too random for my taste.

It can be very "take-that" so need to be okay with destroying plans of others as well as have yours destroyed.

Lots of "reading" on cards, so not the ideal game if playing with kids.

RATING: 6
A fun and easy to teach game. The theme draws new players in, and the mechanics are quick to learn and straightforward. As most people will point out, some decks are much better than others, and some combinations will simply never win. This becomes far more prevalent with the expansions, all of which have one deck that's incredibly overpowered, two that are relatively balanced with the base game and one deck that is virtually useless.

For its price, I'd say it is a decent game and worth picking up for a small game group. However, it does have its flaws and can become very repetitive if overplayed. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Players shuffle two themed decks together (e.g. Aliens and Robots, or Dinosaurs and Pirates), then play cards in an attempt to influence common bases, and score victory points off them.  Silly, simple game where players may play a minion, and an action, to try to place themselves in a scoring position.  Minions and actions have special effect text which ranges from mildly useful to wildly chaotic.  Bases also come with their own special rules, which means there is a lot of reading to be done, especially in early games.  Cute art, and great, cooky theme.  Unfortunately the game plays like a chaotic, multi-player Schotten-Totten.  Hang on for 75 minutes (way too long for this type of game) and hope you get left alone.  Okay, if you're in the mood for silly.

UPDATE: Played the iPad version again, this time with my 13-year-old son. We actually started having fun, now that we spent more time playing the game. The iPad interface could certainly be improved — it would be nice to have drag and drop functionality. But the game is still playable, and I’m now more motivated to invest in the physical card game.

The blending of factions isn't what I expected.   You aren't really playing Robot Dinosaurs...  you're playing Robots and Dinosaurs.   The special abilities and actions are completely unpredictable, even though each faction has some thoughtful theming behind it.   So, it's a highly random take-that game.   I think Blood Bowl Team Manager is a better implementation of this same kind of idea.

The concept is so simple, take two archetypes and mix them together to form your deck of cards. Then play these cards to Bases that score you points. The concept is simple and very fun. The only downside is that with each archetype trying to play and feel differently there's some volatility where two just do not have synergy with one another and is very hard to get the rolling and others work very well together. Still though, I like the game enough to have kept up with the entire line and plan on keeping up because it is just good fun.

Is this a game or just marking ploy to sell expansions?  The player promoting this game first boasted the game to us by opening the box containing ALL the expansions to date and saying, “looking at all the variety of combinations you can choose from: you could have Wizard-Zombies fighting Dinosaur-Pirates!” to which my initial thought was, ‘I couldn’t care less, how does the game play???’   

Well, the game play is chaotic, random and not very strategic at all.  Basically, you look through your hand full of ‘take-that’ cards and play one.  I played with four players, and after reading the comments on this game, apparently that is a no-no for this game: it dragged on WAY too long between turns, and during each player’s downtime, we basically started chatting about other things to do and everyone lost interest.  Except for the player who brought the game, none of us liked it.  

“Mashing genres” seems be the only selling-point of this game, not the game-play or mechanics.  If that’s the only saving-grace for this game, the average game-play should be five minutes, not 45 minutes!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game has grown on me. The trick is to tailor your strategy to the factions that you're playing. You really need to get an expansion or two so you don't have to play the same factions over and over. Some of the factions in the original box seem a little weak compared to the factions that come in the expansions though. Also, the game works best with about 3, maybe 4 players - any more than that and it's long and not as much fun because there are too many things out of your control.

Fun game, love the theme and the cards. A little heavier than the look of the game would suggest, it takes some concentration and thinking to keep track of the card interactions and totals on bases, so I dinged it a point or two for that.

I wanted to love this game, the premise sounded amazing. But in actuality I found that it felt like a quick filler but felt like it went on for way too long.

If the game lasted 15-20 minutes I'd be fine with it.

Smash Up is the game I have picked up and put down more than any other board game. It looks and sounds great, but somehow I always managed to justify not buying this game.

one week I had no other options on the table and my board game allowance wasn't about to go towards paying a bill, so I broke down and purchased this gem.

Then I felt dumb for putting it down all those other times. So much wasted time not playing this game. What a great game. So much diversity to choose from. Pop culture factions that don't feel ham-fisted into the game. Each faction has a play style that works with the theme they represent. 

Strategy, fun, game mechanics, High quality art... I know a score above 6 on this site jeopardizes a gamer's geek-cred but I find it near impossible that anyone would not enjoy this game.

It's dreadful. Can't understand why its as popular as it is.

Played a few times and I hated it. Not a lot of interesting decisions and some factions (looking at you, ninjas) feel supremely underpowered. All complexity in gameplay comes from text on cards, so players will be spending their time reading everything in their hand. It feels like it should be a 15 minute game, but runs way too long. Halfway through the game you'll just want it to be over.

Seriously, take a step back and watch your friends silently lean over the bases reading text. Is this player interaction? Good gameplay?

There are so many superior filler/intro games available- don't waste your time here.

At first I thought it would be just another Dominion ripoff, but after just one turn you see it's not the case. It's fun to mix two factions and try to get combos out of them.

I love this game.  It feels like a deck builder where your decks have already been built and now you're playing them at the height of their power.  Watching the card abilities mesh with each other is a blast.  Combos that don't seem like much can blossom hands that produce amazing results.  My Alien Pirate combo cleared 3 bases in one turn, and then a fourth the following round to win the game.  

Yes, the game is designed for tearing your opponents down as much as you try to build yourself own minions up. Don't play if you want a pacifist game. 
Yes, there is some down time as others think and strategize. Yes, you need to keep track of all the various abilities on the table to optimize your deck's effectiveness.
But, as an ex-Magic player, I don't mind the mental tracking of the powers and cards on the board.  I prefer a game that has some cerebral taxing to build up your best punch.  I don't want a game that has me look at my cards and immediately know the best play.
The game is best with players (obviously) who know the factions they are playing.  Otherwise there will be time taken as new cards are reviewed.  
This isn't Yahtzee.  
We play a King of the Mountain version.  The winner can use his/her combo deck until defeated, and then they need to create a new one.  The defeated create new Smash Ups to take on the current King of the Hill.  Forces us to continuously explore new combos.

Wanted to like this... it looked like it would be a quick game, but in all 4 plays, the game took forever! It felt like there was a lot of reading, down time, and some people had analysis paralysis when they would have to read over what each card on the board did and how the ones in their hand would optimally impact them.  When there are 6+ cards on each planet, it makes for LONG turns.... cool concept, but not what I was looking for.

Garbage. It's everything wrong with 'take that' Ameritrash. This game is complex in the worst way. Just like another crap "game," Fluxx, every card changes the rules in a small way. There is so much garbage to keep track of between minion special powers, base special powers, and lingering action cards. So much changes every turn you can't plan anything beforehand. Every turn you have to read what's in your hand, what's on the board, count the values on the bases, check for all the interactions, then finally play something. But all that is either going to be screwed by the time it's your turn again, or be screwed immediately by another player's special action card. Why even try to do anything clever? The whole damn game is every player, on every turn, reaching across the table to rotate a card and say, "Wait, what's this one do again?" I only rate games a one if they suck and aren't even a game. I rate this game a two because it sucks but I admit it is a game.

The "brospeak" wording of the rules at first made me wary.   This one has surprising complexity for what seems like a theme pandering to the lowest common denominator, the kitchen sink of genre games. I consider it a more developed cousin to Munchkin. While both are steeped in the chaos of "take that" abilities and effects, the latter subjects players to far less opportunity to win on individual merit.

What might throw off casual gamers is a fair amount of numbers tracking, essentially which bonuses apply to which cards, in which locations, and to which players. Each turn presents a veritable litany of pluses and minuses through which players must navigate.

FYI - My first four player game might have been quicker if we'd played some rules correctly:

1) There is supposed to be one more base than there are players. This would have meant less squabbling over territory and some cards being slightly more powerful.

2) Once scoring begins on a base, it continues EVEN IF total minion power falls below the Breakpoint, and if minions that get to move to other bases afterward would cause those bases to score, they do before the next turn begins. This would certainly have aided faster scoring and a sooner end.

3) This rule was relevant during one score: Players involved in a tie each score the same Victory Points, but use up as many succeeding places on the base as there are tying players. So, if two players tie for highest minion power on a scoring base, they both receive the 1st place point value. The player with the next highest power in that scenario gets the 3rd place point value, not the 2nd. If four players have minions on a scoring base, and three of them tie for highest power, those three get the 1st place value and the fourth gets no points!

There is too much combo reading all the time (after each card play by everyone not familiar with the card), unless you've played it enough to know all the factions - which I don't intend to do - so there is that ;)

A fun, light game with plenty of humour. This did not work well with my kids due to being able to play cards aggressively against particular players.

I managed to get it onto the table again with my kids, aged 9 and 10, by letting them gang up on me and combine their point scores. Even so, I annoyed my son by having Leprechauns that kept on making him discard good Ninja cards, but they pipped me by one point and were happy at the end.

(Rating includes expansion: [thing=134726]Awesome Level 9000[/thing])

Smash Up is a fun game, but it suffers from a few problems.

1) It can be a bit intimidating to get started despite the easy rules because each player picks two factions at the beginning of the game and knowing which factions work well together is very important. Of course, knowing the factions themselves is also very helpful so you know what the faction does and where it shines.

2) Keeping track of everything can be a nuissance when there are numerous bases, creatures and actions on the table. Using dice or other measures to keep track of the total strength helps, but there are still other effects that might influence the status.

3) Smash Up is best played with 3 and only 3. With 2 players the scoring of the bases doesn't work at all because you get second place very easily by just placing one creature there and you spend way too much to gain first place. With 4 players, it just takes forever as there are even more effects in play and the downtime becomes a real problem.

I once heard someone saying that the idea of Smash Up is better than the game itself and I have to agree. For one, I wish it would play faster. There is a lot of back and forth so it can take a while until you actually score a base.

Once you get past the charm of zombie-plants or ninja-gnomes or whatever, the game is about finding synergistic combos in text heavy cards that will enable you to score points in area majority "locations." I played once so far with a group that like lighter, more social games and in that sense, it had reasonable decisions to offer, It probably helped that my zombie-ninjas ran away with the game (highly recommend that combo). Whether or not it holds my interest remains to be seen, but nothing I'm going to seek out.

Wacky variety of abilities gaming taken to the next level...kinda like Small World race/power meets card chaining as seen in most deck builders. The players get 2 sets of race decks and mix them to form a hybrid power. Silly fun in concept, but text heavy the first few plays. Not awful, but this one is not for me.

RATING: 7
A neat alternative to the collectible card/deck-building market.  Mix A + B or B + C or even A + C, there is your deck!  For anyone who retired from MtG because building a deck was such an arduous process, this is an interesting, lighter alternative.

Definitely some combos are better than others and some decks offer better synergy but it's fun to try them and see what happens; if you are worried about certain combinations, do a draft style game.

Don't expect the depth and strategy of MtG, just take Smash-Up for what it is.  A light-hearted area control/pseudo-deck-builder game.

I find this game infuriating. Special Powers on each base, Minion, and Action cards quickly become mental clutter that can be handled in two ways: Ignore anything that wasn't played by you, or constantly reference ever single card out there (I.E. take forever). This is compounded by the constraint of playing 1 card of each type which can create instances where a deck is unable to perform in any enjoyable fashion because of the take-that performed by other players.

This game would be a Munchkin-killer if I hadn't already grown out of my Munchkin phase before obtaining this game.  It has the OP-combos of Munchkin without the long, drawn-out ending (and not so much king-making).  It's light filler and yes, the card design is awful, yes the scoring is a bit of a pain, and yes they should have included something in the game to keep score with, but I enjoy it.  I like that you can have a perfect plan for winning in your next turn and by the time it gets to you not one, but at least two people have probably completely ruined that for you, yet you can still come up with a pretty good plan; while it may seem that some combos are wrecking everyone else, in the end I find it pretty balanced (somehow).

A surprisingly fun game.  I thought for sure I wasn't going to like this game based on comments that I had read comparing it to Munchkin. The game is very simple to pickup and yet there is enough complexity to make the game require a great deal of thought to play correctly.  You get more resources in cards than you tend to be able to keep up with using, so the actions that you take each turn matter quite a lot and you are faced with decisions that actually matter on a frequent basis.  A lot of other games I have played make me feel like the games are playing themselves and I am just carrying out the actions for the game.  Smash Up actually gave me the feeling like I was in control of the game instead of the other way around.

Theme: Awesome theme with puns all around
Relevant Choices: How you play the game pretty directly effects your likelihood of winning the game.
Card Art & design: Great artwork
Replay: Tons of replay through the potential deck combinations.
Learning Curve: Low learning curve, easy to pick up and play. 
Promotion of thought: Lots of potential synergies between cards and factions providing for a good deal of planning and strategy
Random Element: Card draw and faction combinations, but the random element of the game is very manageable.
Box: The box comes with a ton of open spaces for adding new factions to the game through expansions.  Does require sleeves to have the factions fit snug though.

I love this game.  It is simple and easy to play.  This is one that is great to play with the kids.  Not much complexity really here but you can blast through a game and just ahave a nice time doing it.  I really like it.  

Only negative that I can see is that I believe they will produce expansion after expansion to milk my wallet (with no real improvement to the game)

This being said, This is the throw together game that is just plain fun.

I put this game on a 10x10, and then played it only a single time after "forcing" myself to play it a bunch of times.  I never even played a single one of the factions in the Monster Smash expansion, as far as I can remember.  Smash Up is a game that I bought mostly for the theme, but the gameplay was uninspiring, requiring a lot of tedious re-calculating all the time.  Nobody ever asked for a game of Smash Up, including me, so it had to go.  

[b]previous comment:[/b]

A fairly fiddly, wildly swingy, often very imbalanced asymmetrical card game.  Smash Up mostly gets played by me because I still do find the silliness of the theming to be amusing.  I have several expansions, but don't expect to purchase any more of them.  This is a game I'm certainly willing to play, and have brought with me when I traveled, due to its portability if you just choose a handful of factions, but it's not a game that I am ever in a rush to get out.

I have played a few games of this now (always with randomly drawn decks) and the power levels of certain factions and certain combinations are much more powerful than others. This can lead to very one-sided games.

Alternatively to can end up with a table full of combinations that do not really compliment each other thus game play is very slow and mostly boils down to play a card draw a card still find no options.

I dislike this uncertainty with the but if we were to pick combinations rather than randomly assign then power gaming munckinness would follow with players more experience picking better combinations.

Nice diversion for a light brainless filler but nothing else really here

Its deck building and yet its not deck building.  The core game comes with eight "races", each with their own deck.  Take two decks and shuffle them together and those are your cards.  Other players do the same with other "races".  Then you battle.  Each "race" has its own style.  Zombies help you get cards out of the discard.  Dinosaurs have sheer power.  Bots amplify each other, etc.  Its a nice light-hearted game that no one takes too seriously.  There's 56 different deck combinations in the core game, with tons of expansions to make that even better.  And the basic box has plenty of room for extra expansions in it, too.  So there's good replay-ability.

Pros
-Less mathy than I thought (see cons)
-Fun mashing two decks together
-Races feel fairly unique
-Simple to play and teach
-Nice artwork, fun card names occasionally
-Lots of cards, lots of replayability
-Ability to do combos (not too advanced)
-Lots of expansions, lots of recognizable, unique races

Cons
-A little bit mathy, needing to occasionally calculate and compare numbers is annoying, especially numerous modifiers
-Spatially can be a bit messy, have to be organized in how you arrange cards around bases...lots of cards makes play space confusing
-Lots of card text (even though its mostly simple) makes it hard for new players initially, also slows down gameplay as you need to keep checking what other people played, and recheck as you go
-Alliances/king making can be a problem
-Game can go on longer than one may expect
-Easy to get screwed over by another player last minute right before a base is scored with little counter-play (esp in larger group games)
-Deck combinations are not balanced, some will be stronger than others
-Base game doesn't come with VP markers (fixed in expansions)

Very simple shuffle building game. Take any two factions, shuffle the decks together. You're competing to conquer bases which require a certain amount of power collectively to score. Each turn you can play one creature and one action. All the expansions just add more decks and more variety. Doesn't take long to play, but recommend it with three or four and having one less base in play than recommended forces more interaction and makes things go faster.

Nagyon vicces a játék, jókat lehet mulatni a különböző kombókon, dumákon, képeken. Nincs is jobb annál, mint amikor kiteszel valami nyomorult manócskát, mint hidden ninja, vagy nyolcvanhatodszor hozod vissza ugyanazt az idegesítő zombit a játékba.
Viszont ahhoz képest, hogy milyen könnyed, milyen random, elég sokat kell olvasgatni benne. Első játékra képtelenség volt átlátni, hogy most melyik bázison, melyik ember mit tud, melyik bázisnak mi a képessége stb. Lehet, hogy elsőre nem annyira jó 4 fővel tolni, inkább két-hárommal kéne megpróbálni, hogy egy kicsit átlássa az ember a dolgokat.

-------------
Pár játék után a fő bajom vele, hogy ennek egy pörgős, könnyed játéknak kéne lennie, de pont ez a kettő nem igazán igaz rá. És közben ezekhez jön, egy már-már elviselhetetlen randomfaktor. Annyira sok múlik a jó húzáson, tekintve, hogy alig jutsz laphoz, hogy csak na.

-> 6.2

Négy játék után se lett jobb a véleményem. Szerintem nem adok neki több eséylt. Iszonyatosan fájó randomfaktor, súlyosbítva totális beragadásokkal, és emellé még csak egy könyned, szórakoztatató játékmenet se párosul. Még a negyedik játékban is rengeteget kellett olvasni, silabizálni. Nem jó... :(

A simple and elegant game from AEG. Awesome components, ridiculously easy rules with card driven mechanics to make the game light, but with deep and interesting decisions. Having 8 factions is a good start for replayability, but this game is begging for at least one or two expansions to make it really satisfying.

Also this game is screaming for counters for the base and for the VPs of each player. Counting points, especially when power additives are in play for a base or for robots detracts from the enjoyment.

RATING: 6.737
Yet to decide if fun simple combo fun, or rubbish - - so, middle ground rating of 7, but i then minus two as the original game is only half complete and needs the first expansion - a first expansion that includes VP tokens and improved base cards, come on now, that is treating the buyer with contempt (game rating 7)  (Feb 2014).  UPDATE: I must admit, not a fan of these every card breaks a rule, every deck is different and unbalances, type games.  And yet, I keep it because its uncomfortable, just so I can hopefully work out why (Rating 6.737, Nov 16)

I wanted to try this really bad at Essen 2012 and I don't regret doing so. Mixing all the different factions is just really fun and the results are always different and challenging to work with. When you know the cards a bit better, it plays a lot quicker and the downtown isn't too bad, especially since the game always keeps you involved. I love this game so much, I bought all the expansions and have even been making my own.

A royally evil adventure every time, can be fun, but slow until we all learn the cards.  It rewards repeat plays, but at 40-90 minutes a game (3-4p), it's overstayed it's welcome.

It's a fun quick game that you can easily teach new players to play and just wacky seeing all the mixed up factions your friends make and combine their two powers into a serious power house of combos.  Just need to buy the expansion for the extra four factions to wiggle with when playing with four players, and tokens (and a place to put said tokens).

Always good for a laugh. 

Only issue is that it can't decide how serious of a game it wants to be. The setup and rules set it up to be a simple, lighthearted game where robot zombies fight wizard pirates or whatever. But there's actually a whole lot of complex decisions to make and planning to do, so new players get stuck thinking for a very long time. Even though it seems like it's a quick party game, it's really not. But it's not quite complex enough for a serious thinky game either? Not sure what niche to put it in.

special power card game with comical fantasy theme. Really a silly game where you are just playing special power cards back and forth at one another. There is also a point system to decide victory. I think the only interesting part of the game is the tacit incentives to cooperate to score bases. Hard to really plan much with so many "take that" cards in the decks. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting little card game, which can really be fun when played with the right folks in the right setting. It's clearly meant to be a light, beer and pretzels kind of game but it can often last way longer than I want it to.

The factions are too unbalanced (the zombies are tons of fun to play but pretty annoying to play against) and there's too much randomness and chaos for my tastes. 

If it were possible to move through your deck faster, I probably would've enjoyed it more. It seemed like I would frequently end up with a hand full of either minions OR actions and would get sort of jammed up since there was no way to discard unless your hand went over 10 cards or an action card granted you that ability and usually while that was happening my opponent would be running the table so that became very frustrating.

And the fact that the base game doesn't come with a way to track your victory points or the minions' power on each base is pretty lame, it just needlessly extends the game because you have to stop and count the power up each turn.

The art is really nice. The theme is fun but I get roughly the same experience from King of Tokyo, which is a much more fun game, in my opinion.

Also, this was the first (and, so far, only) game that my wife declared that she hated.

Traded it away.

A very fun game that has the feeling of a CCG/LCG.  With only the base game I think there is a lot there to play with.  Since you get to combine two decks together to make one larger deck mean there are plenty of combinations.  I will definitely be looking to purchase the expansions!

RATING: 6
It's a fine game, it's a lot less random than I thought it would be, there's even room for some strategy. It has a lot of boring counting and it baffles me that a modern game doesn't come with any way to track points. It feels unfinished in a lot of ways: It is unbalanced, has poorly written rules, the components are lacking and I would never want to play it with any other player count than 3. I thought it was a gateway game, but the rules and interactions can be very confusing. 

All in all, I'm not really sure who this game is for and how it can be as popular as it is. I will probably continue to have fun with it at my mixed and nerdy game group, which seems to be the perfect place for it.

I like it - it really needs the expansion though.  8 decks is just not enough with 4 players.  Variety is the spice of this game, so if every faction is taken, it blunts that.  You really need at least one, probably 2 expansions to make it a solid game that has a lot of replay value.

It's cooky and zany and doesn't take itself to seriously.  There are certainly strategic plays to make, and despite the artwork, you can definitely think a lot about what you're trying to do.

Like it, don't love it.  It'll hit the table because it's unique and fills a certain time frame that people are drawn to.

A game design (mechanicwise) that has its roots in a Knizia classic (Chinese Wall). However there is 10 years later in game design a lot more going on. 8 different factions with lots of different special functions. And this is also the main point of critique. You'd like have always a quick overview of how many points are placed to a base. Because of all those modifiers in the text this isn't possible anymore, so ergonomy is suffering.

Very fun light card game that's really easy to teach, though beginner games can take awhile due to unfamiliarity with cards. Great artwork and fun themes. Pretty fun 2p game that wife enjoys, interested in trying with more players.

I like the concept and the idea of mixing the decks, but I didn't find it all that fun. 

There's a lot to keep track of, and if you're playing with people who aren't too into it or in a loud environment it's easy for the game to derail and take far too long.

It should have a way to track how close each base is to blowing up. We were very close to not noticing a couple of them were about to complete.

Lots of replay ability with all the different decks. The unique decks are fun to read and the interaction is pretty cool. 

However, after playing this game once I don't have any desire to play it again. With four players it was pure chaos and a few turns in I was frustrated. 

I can see the appeal of the game but it's not my style.

Smash up is probably my favorite game. It plays fast and the combinations are endless. My one complaint is that many of the games I play are decided by a random choice. Such as one player who is not going to win, choosing the winner. It pretty much comes down to who do they want to lose, and then they act accordingly. I guess that is part of the game but it seems to happen much to often.

Fun game once you get used to the nature of different factions synergies. Do not try with more than 4 players though as things get sluggishly slow. In our case we played 6 and played with 6 bases out and 10 points to win. In retrospect if I had to play more than 4 again, I'd play with 4 bases to make folks interact more on the bases. But yeah, who wouldn't want to know who's better, zombie ninja's or wizard pirates? Now we can find out :-)

Smash Up consistently seems to go longer than it needs to.  It has relatively simple rules and concepts, but in play, it can get bogged down in a stalemate.  It's also tough to fit all the cards on the table in a 4 player game.  But the theme is so much fan and each race creates such a unique game.  Tough call.

Never quite as satisfying as I want it to be, but still a fun game. The basic premise carries a lot of weight with me (Robot Ponies Vs. Zombie Pirates Vs. Ninja Princesses? what could be better?) I have the pretty pretty smash up and  science fiction double feature expansions, and I'm afraid that after a while, the creators will run out of truly novel wrenches to throw into the base game. Also, just a little too long to really make for a good warm up or wind down game (but we have one person who is very prone to analysis paralysis with just about any game).

Kept hearing about this, finally tried it in 2015. Had a feeling my boys would enjoy it, and they did. Still, I had no desire to purchase it, but finally did so at their request. 

Initially, I thought it was a bit too much like Munchkin, but that it had enough combo-ey goodness (like Magic) to make it interesting enough to play every once in a while. However the more I've played it, the more I've come to enjoy it, especially as we've added more and more factions to our game through the expansions. The rating is climbing!

The game looks good. But I do not like it. Maybe if I played with people on my level of experience because the gap between experienced vs inexperienced players is wider than the Grand Canyon. That's not a problem with a fast game but these games are not fast.

This game is a throwback to my 80's Ameritrash boardgaming youth. If I was still 13-14 then SMASH UP would be one of my favorite games of all time. But now, even as a filler or a quick nostalgic gaming lark, it doesn't work at all.

The game embraces chaos, randomness, luck of the draw, take that. It's a LCG-lite with variable and asymmetrical powered decks that combine to spontaneously generate wacky and usually wildly over- or underpowered combos and lots of imbalance depending on the factions you select. 

There is very little depth and control in the gameplay. You aren't actually constructing, you are combining two preset decks which don't interact with each other at all - another knock on the supposed "theme." If the pirates and ninjas, for example, could interact with each other within your deck in meaningful ways, it would have helped. 

Because it's CCG/LCG the game is text-heavy and has timing/fiddliness issues - so while it looks super-awesome to kids, it's not really a great game for younger, non-Magic savvy players.

It played like the worst bits of Strange Synergy and Fluxx. Overstays its welcome - especially with 3 or 4 players.

Quarriors or Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards scratch this Ameri-itch much better - there's randomness and combos, but there is also strategy, balance and the dice mitigate or at least justify the luck/random element.

The game theme is like a B-movie at a drive-in theater. The presentation and price point insures that this light chaotic romp will be popular - as it already is on BGG. Especially with expected expansions (the box insert already has 8 more deck slots for future factions). 

My game rating reflects the admiration at AEG's marketing, game theme, and presentation.

Fun game that is very interactive and that makes it really fun. People that don't like having their plans messed with will struggle to like this as part of the appeal is messing with other players' plans. The game is easy to learn and on the surface there may not seem to be much strategy, but there can be in setting up a nice combo or affecting other players to thwart their plans. 

The artwork and theme are awesome. It's easy to set up and explain. Once players are familiar with the keywords, then it's full steam ahead.

RATING: 7
Smash Up's theme is good nonsensical fun. Things are fighting other things. That's all you need to know. The illustrations are really quite lavish and stay away from being overly cartoony, despite the lightness of the game. The box has ample room for the inevitable expansions. From a production standpoint, this one is a winner.

The gameplay consists of fighting over various locations in the center of the board. Each location grants points to the player with the highest total strength of his cards played at said location. Once a total strength threshold is reached, these points are awarded, and the first player to a set number of points is the winner of the game. In practice, this ends up being a lot of addition and calculation, and never really feels like a real battle. The creature cards never really attack each other. 

The hook of the game is that your deck consists of two different factions of creatures shuffled together, from the available 8. So you might have pirates and zombies fighting against your opponents ninjas and dinosaurs. Sometimes these combinations can be very complimentary, and other times not. The deck can be quite literally stacked against you from the start depending on how you draw. Additionally, some of the factions focus on discarding certain types of cards from play. If your opponents deck does not have that type of cards, many of your draws will be dead weight. 

All of this randomness could be forgivable since it is such a quick and light game. Unfortunately, the combat itself offers very little opportunity for combos, clever card play, tough choices, or sacrifice. Hand management is almost irrelevant. For the first few games, you will be caught up laughing at the theme and artwork, but once you have seen it, there is no real fun to fall back on.

This was the hit of Gen Con 2012 for me.  The variety of decks you can build is nice and just when you think you have the combinations figured out, a new wrinkle is discovered.  If you don't like chaos, stay away.  I look forward to the expansion decks.

The flashy artwork is cool & the factions seem fun, but the game in itself is no fun.. usually there are these fun moments during a game.. when a bluff is called upon.. or you safed up for something and build something great or whatever.. but this fun moment seems to be missing in Smash up. People just play their funny creatures one after another to score VPs.. and that's it..

To be honest, it is better than I was expecting. The matches are fast (maybe too fast), dynamic and the players are always interacting with each other. The tematic is kind of "pop" so it's help to find someone to play with you (who doesn't want to control zombies ninjas or aliens dinosaurs, for example?). Two more things to consider: it's language-dependent and it's hard to keeping control of the bases scores (unless you print a tracking score).

RATING: 6
Funny game as hell, all these different deck combinations make sure that you play a long time and always have a new combination to try out. However, outside of experimenting the different combinations, game-play itself doesn't change at all, it's always the same. There's a bunch of bases you need to take over with the units your deck provide, using special skills and other tricks in your disposal. But deck combinations and randomly chosen bases are the only variables of the game. Other than those it's the same formula all over again, all the time. With right people, more occasionally, it helps it keeping more fresh and then it works so much better and is so much more fun. The actual game-play, although it is repetitive, is still a loads of fun. Game ain't broken in that sense at all.

[b]After 3 plays:[/b]  A lighter [i]take that[/i] card game with THE AWESOMEST THEME POSSIBLE:  disparate genre tropes wedded as conjoined twins to do battle with enemy Frankendecks.  The presentation and form promise hilarious, rapid back-and-forth; this is unrealized in actual play as everything bogs down with the reading Reading READING of too much text on most every card, leading to more rereading and rules-interaction head scratching.

Perhaps this will pick up with familiarity?

Terrible game.  If you like the seemingly never ending torture of Munchkin then you'll probably like this.  If you don't like keeping track of cards that change the status across the whole board or actions that erase someone's progress just when it looks like they might actually make some progress towards the finish line then I think you should steer clear.  After my second play I wanted to shred the game so it would never be put in front of me again.

No idea where all hate comes from, this is a superb game!
 
A very good mix of a light LCG, Smallworld and Kings of Tokyo. If you like any of those, you will like this. 

Light yet tactical, faction specializations are easily understood but fully mastered only after several matches. Add to this the different faction combinations (further enhanced by the add-ons), you get awesome replayability. 
And all that for less than 30 bucks (22 @Amazon).

Reviewing only the base game. It's fun and easy to teach, I do wish it was about 10-15 minutes shorter, but that's a minor gripe. I know with more factions the game will really shine. 

The main issue with this game is that it is only good with 3 players. 4 players is waaaaay to chaotic and 2 players is plain boring. Some other issues is that in the upper echelon of players(even 3) there is too much information on the field on both player cards and locations. And lastly, minor, but very apparent is that game is best with a few expansions to go with it.

Combine two factions to make your own deck; play cards (minions and actions, max of one per turn) to capture points from locations. First to 15 points wins.

Not all factions are equal, but most are interesting. Combining with any expansion increases the possibilities. In the base box, there is room to fit two expansions. Maybe three if you take out the ones no one ever uses (like Trickster).

Whenever we play, we often give each player 3 random factions and they pick which two they want to play with. It pushes us to break out of what we tend to gravitate towards and try the other factions out.

RATING: 5
Zombie pirates battling alien ninjas sounds so very much cooler than the game this turned out to be. Way too much of it gets bogged down in counting and re-counting and reading and re-reading the wall of text that's on every card. Combine that with a boring goal of scoring majorities (without a scoreboard!) and I found the whole design to be very disappointing.

This was the game that first got me into hobby board gaming, so it holds a special spot in my collection.

Such a fun card game that attempts to mix every geek genre out there! Pirates, Dinosaurs, Zombies, Robots, Aliens...the list goes on. 

This introduces a new mechanic in a world of 'deck-building' games called, 'shuffle-building.' You simply take two faction decks and shuffle them together. So one person could be playing Dinosaur Ninjas (or Ninja Dinosaurs depending on your philosophical bent) vs Zombie Wizards. Play goes back and forth, competing for first place points on Base Cards.

Best played as a 2-player game, though it can go up to 4.

Kurzweiliges Kartenspiel mit hohem Wiederspielwert
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
El concepto es simple: se toman 2 mazos de entre 8 pertenecientes a facciones de la cultura pop (zombies, ninjas, aliens, robots, hadas, dinosaurios, magos o espías), se barajan juntas y el objetivo es conquistar una cantidad determinada de "bases" (otras cartas que están en el centro de la mesa). La idea es que cualquier jugador puede asignar unidades en esas bases con el fin de sobrepasar su resistencia. Una vez que se derrota la base, el que haya contribuído con más fuerza a derrotarla, anotará puntos de victoria (el segundo y el tercero suelen anotar también PV´s) 

Las cartas son de dos tipos: los esbirros y las acciones. Los esbirros son los que realmente se juegan en las bases y la mayoría de ellos tienen una habilidad especial que se activa cuando se ponen en la mesa. Las acciones permiten al jugador jugar esbirros extra, devolver cartas al mazo de robo, aumentar la fuerza de los esbirros, evitar acciones especiales de los contrincantes... En definitiva: hacer combos.

Es adictivo, es caótico: si; pero parece bien equilibrado si juegas cada facción a lo que se supone que mejor sabe hacer.

PROS: Curva de aprendizaje asequible para novatos. Mucha diversidad para elegir. Cada facción tiene un estilo de juego que casa con su tema (dinosaurios, destruir; ninjas, efectos sorpresa....) Rápido y fácil además de tener la informalidad necesaria para que nadie se lo tome muy en serio si pierde.

CONS: La idea del juego es mejor que el juego en sí, ya que a 4 jugadores es demasiado largo y con más de 2 es bastante caótico. Las primeras veces es demasiado largo al no conocer nadie las cartas, los efectos y sus consecuencias. Es carne de expansión, porque las facciones del juego base se quedan cortas tras 12-15 partidas.

Runs too long for what it is.  The theme had a lot of potential to be funny and alluring, but it just feels flat.  You just create columns of numbers to add up.  I don't like the slow pace of drawing new cards either.

Smash-Up suffers from having too many cards in play at the same time. The more players, the worse the problem. It's somewhat fun to play, but keeping up with all of the ongoing rule effects can be tiresome. At some point, it just feels like busy work. I might play again if the mood strikes me right, but it's definitely not at the top of my list. On the plus side, the art is very fun and pretty to look at. I also like the ability to choose which two factions to mix together. It adds a fair amount of variety to the game play.

This game was hard to take seriously on the first few plays, but greater familiarity has proven it to be very cleverly designed and quite addictive. Unpredictable, chaotic, but surprisingly balanced despite the endless varieties of combos. There is a fair amount of strategy involved--hand management, placement of cards, utilizing your factions' strengths effectively. Bottom line: just plain fun. Extra half point for the Bear Cavalry's "You're Screwed" card.

Great artwork, great cards, great idea - In theory. But in practice, it's just too messy to play. Fighting over bases feels like an endless tug of war that takes far too long to complete. That said, I love the idea of facing off crazy armies of Zombie Pirates vs Alien Dinosaurs!, etc... (Which geek wouldn't?) - But, all in all, it just wasn't an enjoyable play for me - and no amount of fan service can amend that.

I was so excited to play this game. I heard that this game that features a ton of asymmetrical teams that can be mixed together making unique combinations which would make each game feel fresh. That’s a fantastic idea to work a game around. 

The problem is that I found the gameplay to be slow paced and boring. When you look at the phenomenal artwork on the box and the cards, it gives you the idea that the game is going to be about these different factions fighting one another. But the gameplay never feels like you’re a part of a battle. Each of the characters that you throw on the table just becomes a part of a math equation, and each action card adds a variable that you have to account for a turn or two. After each player lays down a card, you have to add up all of the numbers again and again. 

I know that a lot of games rely on similar number-dependent mechanics but what makes this game worse than other games is that this one doesn’t seem to hide it at all. It just feels like math homework, and it’s not very fun.

The idea is there, the look is there, but it plays slower than I hoped.  Will have to see if it improves with more plays.  I am thinking about having less bases, currently X+1 where X=No. of players, I think X will be fine.  Force the players together, score Bases sooner.  X works fine.  3 player works well, might be worth getting expansion to make a six player (2x3) game.
Having the VP counters from the expansion helps speed it up, and a visual counter for the bases does the same.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A deceptively deep card game that's easy to learn the basics of.  The 8 difference factions all offer wildly different gameplay mechanics, making for several interesting deck combinations.

Some faction combinations create some glaring imbalances in the game that can easily be exploited by players who are more familiar with the game.

Overall a very fun card game that's more structured and focused than a game like Munchkin, but not nearly as complicated and counter-intuitive as games like Nightfall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The idea of mixing and matching decks is a good idea, but the problem with Smash Up is that the most important part of the game is that act of choosing two decks to smash up. It's a game all about discovering which combinations are most effective - the actual game by which this is done is not that appealing, especially when one happens to pick a poor combination while another player is thriving. Perhaps if the game was shorter it would be more tolerable, but as is it's just not that enjoyable for me to play.

So much promise, but after playing for a while the mechanics become so much more obvious and the theme disappears. If you like adding, subtracting and multiplying simple numbers together to try and reach another number then you will like this. The rating reflects the quality of the art and themeing and those initial games which I enjoyed a lot, just didn't have longevity for me so it got traded.

Everyone has two factions, cards that are shuffled together to form a deck.  You're playing cards from your deck to try to get points, which mostly come from resources in the middle of the table.

Pick 2 factions, put the decks together, shuffle them and play. Works best at 2-3 players. It can start to get complicated with more players as you have more bases to watch.

It's best to try and pick bases that pertain to the decks that were picked as mixing in all the expansions can water down what comes up when randomizing bases (you can end up with effects and stuff that no one can use because you didn't pick a deck that pertained to those bases).

The original game is awesome. I love it! At one point this game was a 10. It has however dropped because with the intro of new factions( which I love ) comes more words on cards. and cards that are more complex actions and minions.  In the original the powers were simple to read and understand.  Personally I have a catch 22 with the expansions.  I want more, I love new factions, but the complicate things to much that i enjoy less.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2013)

I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I didn’t have high hopes for it (because I currently dislike most ”attack the leader” games) but it is easy to teach and fun to play. By description, I should not like this game but the silliness in it is pretty attractive. With new players the downtime is excessive so I would suggest a game to fewer points so everyone can familiarize with the cards. 

The art is great. I really like the mixing of two factions to form your deck, however I’m a little worried about balance issues. 

This is not a deep game by any means, the decisions are rather obvious and you need to attack the current leader or he can run away with the victory. I dislike this part as it assures a long game and all the player´s scores will be close.

This is a fun game to play from time to time. Perhaps I will buy it, if I do I will be getting all the expansions.

I didn't like this game much at all.  For as light as it pretends to be / should be, there is far too much checking cardtext, counting up points, and making sure multiple effects are resolved.  I suppose that would be ok if you got very used to the cards, but the point of this game is to be able to use as many of the different factions as possible.  Just wasn't fun for me.  Also, the rulebook was annoying.

- More luck than I really like
- Early games may be unsatisfying due to not knowing the factions

Finally got to play a couple games of this recently. It's a pretty good little card game. Nice card combinations and more than a little "take that". The factions have a lot of similar abilities, but also manage to play pretty differently.

Update (2014-05-04): I've played this game several more times, and I'm really enjoying how each different faction plays. Until you know the factions, though, you can get burned by selecting two groups that don't play well together.

Update (2015-12-02): After a few more plays, the game length started to become just too much for what the game is. I ended up trading it away.

Smash up is a cool concept and the first and only shuffle building game I've ever played and owned. 

My gripes are more with the concept of shuffle building than they are with smash up itself. 

Overall I love the factions and seeing how the devs brought them all to life. I love the intricacies and the simple and straightforward gameplay and setup that it has and I love the art to death!!!!!

What I don't like: 
New players get hosed and pick factions that may not work well together. Which leads to the next gripe of players are able to pick factions that just don't do much comparatively.
You have to play a lot to see how the factions work together, but there's really not a high degree of replayability. I mean the factions all do what you'd expect but there's only so many times that robots upon robots upon robots is fun to lose to/win with. Because the driving faction typically is what will determine how the deck plays.
Gameplay can be slow and you wait long periods of time to get to you... Plus due to the deck size... There are turns sometimes where you don't do much... Action packed would not describe this game.
Overall you need a sharp group that plays quickly and precisely to play this well.

This is a great, goofy game. There are hundreds of combinations to play in it. It plays best with 3 or 4 players. It's fun with 2, but there just isn't enough going on with that low count. You would be better off playing a game that is designed for 2 players than this one.

RATING: 8
At it's core, this is a light, fun, card game. The base set comes with 8 factions, and no VP chips, which is a bit cheap to be honest.

However, with an expansion to fill it out, this game offers a lot of replayability, and with the right (speed) people is simply fun.

Why it's not higher: The game is fairly swinger and is light fun, so it doesn't have enough bite to make my favourites

quick, chaotic, a bit mathy at times. too chaotic for any real strategy to come into play, I fear.  but does it need strategy to be fun?    

The geek factor is strong here, with the factions being made up of fantastic categories like Wizards, Dinosaurs, Ninjas, Zombies, etc... 2 of which will be combined by a player in order to form combinations that would give any nerd a nerd-gasm.  Love the idea.... but does it play well?  I'm not sure.  with 2 and 3 players it was underwhelming.

UPDATE:  It sort of sits at "meh" for our group.  fun to look at and good mechanics for certain factions, but the end result isn't as exciting as we had hoped.

RATING: 2.5
Disappointing game, expected a better experience.

The problem is that the game is full of cards that need to be read. At the same time, this is a light card game with a lot of chaos. Both ends simply do not combine, since you must read through all the cards in play and in your hand while keeping it light-hearted.

Furthermore, it's a pain in the ass to keep track whether or not the break point of each base has been reached. Too much repetitive math involved for a light game. I use tokens to keep track but that's still not good enough.

All this math and card reading drag the game down and detract from its fun chaotic purpose.

Finally, the game doesn't even come with tokens for VP. WTH! It's not even playable out of the box, which is what you need for a quick, accessible filler.

King of Tokyo is the much superior game here sadly since it plays so smoothly. It's only redeeming quality is that it's cheaper than King of Tokyo (which is overpriced).

You select two classes and mix the decks. Then try to place the cards on bases to match or beat the score on the base. There are action card and minion cards that can be used. Each card has details explaining the abilities. For the most part you can follow what is on the cards. There is definitely some chaos since you can inhibit your neighbors goals. This isn't my favorite style of game, but it is designed well and offers some fun.

Our family has a total blast with this game. Each faction in the base game has a very unique feeling and unique mechanics. It's fun to see the zombies constantly returning from the grave, the wizards casting spells to manipulate their deck, ninja appearing out of nowhere and disappearing again, and so on. We can't wait to try out the expansions. The replayability from being able to combine factions together is awesome!

2/5. Concept is clever, some card interactions are interesting. But potentially unbalanced. Core mechanic of filling bases to score is unique but feels fiddly.

In general I enjoy the gaming mechanism and the whole idea of the game but have played a couple of rounds now that were a little frustrating. This was due to very unbalanced decks, leaving one player in the clear advantage.

I really liked this game when I first got it for a friend (sorry, dude!).  But after a few plays, it got really annoying.

The idea of mashing all these genres together to see who comes out on top is an instant winner.  If you're not careful, Smash Up can disintegrate into a rules lawyering nightmare due to what can at first appear to be conflicting cards.  The game also should probably never be played at 4, it gets too insanely chaotic and long.  Some may like that though.  This shines at 3 players and with the right variant could be awesome at 2 as well.

Lame graphical layout leaves me cold, because there isn't much of a connection to the thematics. The game itself is slow moving and boring. Some comboing possibilities, but mostly you just play 1-3 cards a turn and pass. The card hand limit is also too big which adds badly to the AP.

Love the deck combinations, the different decks, and the cool effects, and most of all, the awesome theme. However, I which we could get this game down in 30-45 minutes, but it often seems to last closer to 75 minutes, even when playing with one less base than normal. Plus, the unmitigateable randomness of the card draw can make for boring stretches of having no minions, of only incompatible ones.

Robot Dinosaurs?, Ninja Pirates?, Zombie Bears?, Alien Wizards?  Sign me up.  

Easy to learn and teach, fun art, quick gameflow, there's so much to like on the surface, but a bit deeper is a really well made and well balanced little card game.  Masked behind all the silliness is a strategic and cut-throat game that has me coming back again and again.  I always want to try new factions, new combos, and even though the game is very cut-throat it's hard to get mad at someone whose plant-robot ate your steam punk-leprechaun.

RATING: 8.5
This is a brilliant concept for a card game but the execution is lackluster. The game takes too long with more bases and 15 points but using variants makes the game around 45 minutes. Most factions do something different which is cool but the balance is a bit off for some of them. Aside from all the negatives the game is quite fun. Finding combos to score the bases that benefit you is fun and creates tension. Sometimes you are not sure if someone else can score it and you might push your luck to wait for a better draw that could get you more points. I like the factions that come with expansions but having the base game and 1 or 2 expansions is really enough to enjoy this game to the fullest. Sadly I can't recommend this game because it requires a lot of work to make it more enjoyable.

Subject to a lot of kingmaking. Once a player falls behind it is very difficult for them to catch up without handing the victory to another player. In 3 of the 4 4-player games I have played one player was at around 8-9 points with the other players all at 12-13. The player trailing was unable to destroy any bases, even as the leader, without potentially giving another player the game.

ouf... this is soooo ordinary (played only at two players). you play this combo, the other players kills your character, than  you kill his, than he plays something, but you don't because you didn't draw a character, and so one and so forth. The theme is completely pasted on random actions and characters. After the whole deck was through, the score was 4 to 3 ( you must go up to 15 points) and no minion was on play. We ended our suffering there. It reminds me of blue moon. You have the impression to control something, but you really don't that much. Gets better at more then two, but still random luck based.

A game that has a lot of replay-ability and always offers fun casual gameplay. There can be elements of strategy applied to the game for those who look for more thought provoking gameplay as well, with how you mix and match your sets of factions.  The game is simple; you pick two factions and score bases against your opponents. Easy to pickup and the gameplay is in the cards.

I've only played Smash Up with my family, not with my gamer friends, so I can't speak to its depth. All I can say is that this game had the potential to be great, but did not get there. The artwork is great and the idea of shufflebuilding two factions and fighting over bases in the middle of the table is a compelling one. Only, it's never more than half realized. There is entirely too much text on the cards, meaning you spend most of your time reading cards instead of playing the game. This is a huge gripe for me, in general, because this could have been solved Race for the Galaxy style, by using icons and giving every player an excellent player aid. Also, the theme is only halfway integrated. Sometimes the powers of the cards are simply tacked-on to seem thematic, even though they don't impact the game. Also, it is entirely too long for its depth. It plays like a fighting game, but in reality it is a multiplayer game (you're not attacking each other directly; you're attacking the bases). This is a huge flaw because it actually means that the better everyone is doing (i.e., the most hotly contested the bases are), the longer the game will go on. That is simply bad design.

Not impressed -- card layouts need to be better to allow stacking.  I enjoyed my play but everyone else hated it so maybe need to play with the right group. [only reason I somewhat liked it was the Trickster/Magician deck -- very magic blue, which I love]

Whimsical card game. Take two factions, put them together, attempt to score areas on the board through hand management. On a turn play a minion and play an action, and follow the card text. I enjoy card games a lot, but I find this one to be lacking. Some turns are longer than necessary, whereas others are of without any imagination. If played at a reasonable pace this could be a decent filler game, but things can bog down and make it a longer game than necessary. There is potentially some balancing issues with the different factions, but even without it there are other card games I would prefer to play within the same time frame. Expansion adds more factions with unbalanced cards. Still a fun lighthearted game if you're not looking for heavy strategy.

"Shufflebuilding"?  Give me a break, there is no building in this game at all.  You pick two factions, and mix the decks together, then draw cards.  Building involves adding cards to the deck... and that never happens.  

The theme of the game is interesting, if only I cared.  Sure, some people think it is hilarious to have robot zombies or ninja dinos, but my general focus is on gameplay.  The gameplay is not BAD... but it isn't GOOD either.  A fairly pedestrian game, one that I would play, but would be very unlikely to suggest.

Humorous take-that card game. As far as these kind of games go, it's one of the best. Certain faction combinations are a bit unbalanced, so it's up to the players to even things out. This, in turn, means the game has a heavy dose of leader bashing. Goofy, yes, but fun.

Take That is not a mechanic I like, although fans of Munchkin may find this fun. Excessive card text leads to long waits between turns and a lot to keep track of for what is supposed to be a light game. Random race combinations can lead to mechanics that are either unfun or just handicapping (don't learn with cybermonkeys and ninjas)

04-08-2014 - Played at Madness on TableTop Day 2014 for the first time and we bought it on our way out!  Since then we've played once more and I don't regret buying it in the least!  Fun!  It has the slight feel of a deck builder similar to Dominion in the way you play and combo cards, but you're NOT actually deck building (like, at all) and there is TONS more interaction (read "attacking, maiming, and killing") between players.  Even though I'm off deck building card games (Smash Up being a card game that only faintly reminds me of a deck builder), I'm hook line and sinker for Smash Up.  Expansions?  Shut up and take my money.

All your childhood favorite heroes, creatures, baddies, and fantasies all meet in card based combat.  Pick your two favorite teams and take over.  This game is definitely one of my favorites.

Also the game may have a slow start for new player since they will be doing some reading.  Patients will pay off with a great game.

The "shufflebuilding" game Smash Up starts with a simple premise: Take the twenty-card decks of two factions, shuffle them into a forty-card deck, then compete to smash more Bases than your opponents! Each faction brings a different game mechanism into play – pirates move cards, zombies bring cards back from the discard pile, dinosaurs have huge power – and every combination of factions brings a different play experience.

I don't mind playing smash up with about 3-4 players.  Anything over 4 players becomes too long of a game.  There is quite a bit of downtime in between turns.  That is one of the major downsides of this game.  I do like trying to figure out a new strategy each time I play since I use new factions that I haven't used previously.  This game is all about combos and effectively using them.  I love that part of it.

This is a pretty enjoyable filler game that you play with a bunch of friends, or possibly complete strangers, between heavier games or at the end of night of gaming. Play time is pretty short, and the mechanics for the game are nothing special. What this game did do, ingeniously I might add, is have players select two different faction decks and shuffle them together creating all sorts of crazy comibinations and synergies. This is game is all about knowing how to make the most of your synergy between your two factions. If you rely too heavily on one faction you will probably get smocked for most of the game. But luckily like I said it will be over quickly. More factions will obviously make this game have even more permutations which is pretty high with the base game with only 8 factions to start with.

I feel that Smash Up fell a bit short of my expectation for it, although it doesn't mean that it's not an enjoyable game.

I stayed away from Smash Up because its nerd-pandery nature turned me off. I really don't need any OMG EPIC BACON NINJA DEAD PARROT AWESOME PIRATE HOT SAUCE SHINY YOU SHALL NOT PASS boardgames. But I'd been told by others who don't tend to speak in catchphrases and movie quotes that the game play was pretty solid, so when a cheap copy came my way, I took a gamble.

It's not bad. Smashing together two factions is pretty neat, and I imagine there's a lot of fun in discovering combos within disparate factions (my Wizards and Robots worked very well together). There's a good game in here, and a lot of room for exploring it.

Unfortunately, it's not a good enough game. At its heart, Smash Up is one of those deploy-units-to-your-side-of-a-base-and-see-who-claims-it games and I've been through a number of those, with Omen: A Reign of War being the one to beat. I don't really need another one.

This game is overrated like Munchkin, but at least Munchkin has some goofiness that made it fun.  This game can really drag out--of course it's random, who knows what will happen!  I don't like that you are given two decks randomly and certain decks work together much better than others.  Might as well just have everyone roll a die and whoever has the highest is the winner.

You could house-rule that by letting people pick 2 decks out of 4 choices.  But then people would take forever to come to their decision.  And it wouldn't fix the basic problem of imbalance, just mitigate it some at the cost of lots of downtime.

It's also really annoying to try to keep track of what all the bases do and what every card that's out there on bases do.  This game is the opposite of elegant.

The premise of this game is definitely really cool, but for a light and silly game there is way too much overhead and it goes on for too long. AEG really needs to develop good iconography that could standardize all the text, as there is no way you can remember what abilities are still in effect to play strategically without having to take forever on your turn. If they fix that this game would at least get a +1 in rating for me, as the game play otherwise has the simplicity to back up its sillyness, the area control is decent, and there is presumably a lot of replayability with the different faction combinations.

I'd bump the rating on this a notch or two if there wasn't so much situational math revolving around the bases. None of it's *difficult* math, but it's a lot of different numbers and it's a continuous recalculation.

RATING: 6
Type: 2-4 player competitive, smash-your-neighbor card game

Best with: 3-4?
Weight: Medium
Duration: 30-60 minutes
Notes:
heavily favors experienced players who already know cards/decks
card-based, not much text, but lots of effects to read, both in hand and placed on the boards
some turns can get complicated and long by a player
screw-your-neighbor quotient is high, especially for someone who gets ahead early

Smash Up is a card game for 2-6 players. Players pick two of the decks in the game and shuffle them together to create their deck for that round. For example, I can pick the Wizards and Zombies decks and combine them for a few games. During play, players play a card and draw a card. They play cards on bases set in the middle of the table. Each card played on a base will accrue points on that base. Once a base reaches a threshold value of points, that base blows up and is scored based on which player has the most points on that base. In the process, cards have various abilities and can be played to screw with your neighbors.

Just to be clear, this isn't a deckbuilding game (where you build your deck as you play) nor is this a customizable card game (where you build your deck at home and come to game night with your best creation). This game just has you pick two 20-card decks when you sit down, shuffle them together, and then smash your opponents' cards.

This ends up being a relatively quick game where you cycle through your given decks pretty quickly, and competition can get pretty fierce as players jockey for control of the bases. In fact, this game doesn't really provide players a chance to sit in a corner and just do their thing; there is constant competition and smashing of minions. Some people may be put off by the ruthless neighbor-bashing, but the game is so quick and the bashing such a prevalent thing, that pretty much everyone gets in on the action and gets hit with the stomping pretty constantly.

One upside to this game is the replayability is pretty high. Each of the base game's 8 factions plays slightly differently, and as such combine to play many different styles. 

There are some downsides to this game, though.

First, the game benefits from repeated play. Some of the card rules can be a bit hard to understand at first and may take some online research. Some sort of catalog of strange cards in an FAQ in the rules would have been crazy helpful. But once you get through all the cards a few times and nail down the rules, the game flows much smoother. However, this does take a while, even for a regular game group.

Second, there are so many rules on the cards! This means that new players will be lost by the time a few minions pepper the bases in the middle of the board. All the text on the cards is pretty much always in effect, so it can be very hard to track what is really going on at any given time. This can really bog down the experience for new players.

Third, the game can be played with 2 players, but really doesn't work nearly as well. You have only 2 bases to fight over, and every neighbod-stomping mechanic *has* to go against the other player, so it can be *very* confrontational. There are many more enjoyable 2-player games out there, even among the direct competition stomp-you-opponent type (Magic, Star Realms, any LCG, etc) that can scratch the card game itch.

Overall, this is a fun, light game when taken in quick doses for some neighbor-stomping fun. Just make sure to keep the game moving and not get bogged down in having too many cards in play that players can paralyzed trying to read everything and piece out plays.

Similar games in my collection: There really isn't anything quite as direct and neighbor-stomping as this game in my collection.

Very simple, but with some surpriusing strategic possibilities.  I can see with the right players that this could be very challenging.  I suspect it's made by deck-builders, as each deck has a very clear advantage consistent through the deck that you pick up on quickly.  Players say "Man I HATE robots.." which is a good indication something is right

Single play. Very simple game, but didn't click with me on any level. The mechanics are whatever, the fun factor is pretty low, and the idea of mashing up two random themes in each deck doesn't shine through at all - it just feels like playing with two different factions, and not a single one combined. My mash-up - Pirate Aliens - had very little synergy between the two factions, or so I felt.

Probably won't turn down a game of this, but definitely won't be asking for one.

RATING: 8
Fun game but not for everyone.  The game is really aimed at teens and it feels like a fad.  The girls in our group have no interest in this game.  That does not work out well for game night.  Also, never, never use the combination of wizards and zombies.  That is a big game flaw.  Everyone else takes their turn in 1-2 minutes while the wizard/zombies take 10 minutes or more per turn.  BAD.

RATING: 7
first play: This game is not difficult but can be a bit slow at first simply because players are not familiar with the cards or the combinations that they could make with them - but that will clearly come with time. In that respect if felt the same as Guillotine did last time though that is simpler/has less text than this. 

Of its style it's complexity is in the middle of Battle line/Blood Bowl Team Manager. The idea of battling over an area is good but being a first play, the benefits of 1 over another are not immediately apparent especially as some have special powers (which are written very small and can easily be missed/forgotten about - ensue "hang on we as supposed to get 1 vp for each minion that dies here - how many was that ?!!". As with the cards, it is almost "all too much".

Game went OK one of the players did a big combo move but then had to redraw his hand and was left with limited options - then again that could likely be mitigated by experience.

Didn't really get the "beating on other players" feel as much as I was expecting. The Alien Zombies seemed to be about putting cards back in your opponents hand and getting things out of the discard for free. Putting something back in someones hand seemed of little real importance, opponent had a minion that allowed them to play multiple actions and when put back in hand they just re-played it and then used multiple actions to get more minions. Maybe it just was not the card to play against that deck or maybe that was actually messing with their plans. Was difficult to say though. 

Game needs score dials. Borrowed some from Blood Bowl Team Manager.

RATING: 5.2
This game presents a neat idea. Pick 2 groups and put them together and have them fight over some territory. It plays a little like Blood Bowl Team Manager except instead of the traditional Warhammer Fantasy races you get Robots, and Pirates, and Zombies (ugh), Aliens, etc. It's cute but really not much substance here.

It's fast light and very much in-your-face... lots of conflict and some cards can be very powerful. Not a big fan of in-your-face games, but this one is okay.
After playing a couple of 3 player games the in-your-face part of the game lessens dramatically plus the game tends to last a little longer which isn't bad. I do like this more with 3 players. I hope to play a 4 player game soon.

I've played the game twice.  It's fun, though a bit crazy. (Maybe the craziness makes it fun?)  Very swingy and luck driven, but you can learn to mix powers to your advantage. You could say it's a tactical game. And it's fun enough so I don't mind losing too much. (I won the second game I played, but lost pitifully the first time.)

-very fun
-strategic, but in its own way
-once you learn it well, feels fast paced and your interested even when its not your turn
-simple overall rules with situation cards, aka easy to learn hard to master (a very good thing in my opinion)

I and a friend have a copy and it worked well having a second set so in the same game could have aliens and pirates vs aliens and dinos.

I love this game but their are many players out there who would potentially not "get it".  You may feel screwed or like your rock to their paper, easy to deal with once you play more or with more than 2 people.  Because of that its hard for a seasoned player to play with a new learner.

Again, a card game in a box that is too big (where did I see this before, *wink*).

There is even room for more cards. Very nice of the publisher to make it so obvious, this game is going to cost more and more money, once you bought it.

Each turn, you play one or 2 cards from your hand in one of the 5 rows of cards already on the table. After a while that means, a lot of cards are on the table, with a lot of text on them. That means, to know what to play next, you need to reread all the cards on the table regularly, in every turn. Duh? Ok, sometimes a row of cards is resolved and removed, but where is the fun? If I want to read a lot, a read an interesting book.

When playing, i had to think about Smallword. Also a game with races and their specific features, but one that I enjoyed playing

Charming, and the strengths and weaknesses of the factions are well thought out and applied.

Fun introduction to heavier card games. The rules are deviously simple, but the cards are not, which makes each faction in the game feel very different.

I did not like this game when I played it. I was expecting a silly game to match the ridiculous theme.  However, what I played was a card game which took itself seriously, but which you threw two deck/themes together. It reminded me of a lazy magic deck building game, rather than a jokey Smash Up comedy.

Also, I did not enjoy the contention for  points mechanicl I thought that Blood Bowl: Team Manager did everything I liked in Smash Up much better. Will refuse to play again.

Should be a fast, snappy, fun little card game, but instead it's all about counting and re-counting points. And there's nothing to track score with, so you'll need a pen and paper. And the box is huge and the 1st expansion is advertised on page 1 of the rules. And some of the combinations are hideous. And often any plans you made are totally messed up by your next turn.

This game is a bit of a grind, really. Shame, because it looks like a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.36
Felt like I was fighting my deck the whole time since I was at or over the max ten card quite often. Bases that give the most points to players with the second highest amount of attack seemed to be dead spots since players didn't want to deal with trying to be second. The game was over far quicker than expected.

Has a nice theme and replay. Expansions could hopefully offer better combos to smooth out the game.

Rating Potential: Likely to stick at 6.5. I can't see it being a 7 so repeated plays might put it down to a 6, but that's it. I enjoyed it for about half the game.

More complex than Munchkin but can give same feel. I mean this in good way, just to make sure (since people on bgg like to bash Munchkin). There's literal Munchkin expansion too.. Munchkin Smash Up brings lovely Munchkin art (jokes are sadly recycled from basic Munchkin set, but the pictures are 3D this time) to the family. Anyway, Smash Up is bit less personal, not as take-that. With some cool CCG-like combo possibilities. Great replayability with expansions, decent without. The whole geeky colourful vibe just makes me happy. World needs more games that make people happy.

You are fighting over locations to earn score and advantages, but the fights themselves don't really feel all that exciting. Considering you have things like Robot-Dinosaurs, Ninja-Zombies, the battles should feel more engaging than placing a card and playing an action.

Started out thinking this game was "meh", upgraded that to "liking" it, and now it is teetering on "love" it. It is "meh" if playing with players who are newbies (because they are learning the effects, game flow, and rules), "likable" if players are remotely familiar, and "lovable" when players know how to play all the cards like veterans. 

Right now we are trying to get our gaming group to become veterans. Almost every person owns a copy of this game in our group now (16-20 copies).

One of my current favorites and I expect will be for a while. It's a lighthearted and fun "king-of-the-hill" type card game that promises a lot of interaction and desperate scheming with the occasional reward of an unexpected killer card combo. This reminds me of Innovation (another of my favorite card games) in that everybody is trying with equal desperation to make something of their unpredictable card draws and just when you think you are hosed you could draw that game-changing card, but you have to play it JUST RIGHT, and even then someone else may have the perfect counter card :)

Really enjoy the card combo strategies here but the constant math requirements without a way to record stats (base strength, points) is frustrating to say the least

RATING: 4
Too much text on the cards makes it very hard to keep track of the current game state.  Perhaps some better iconography would have made the game flow better.

The game is very chaotic, which is not always a bad thing, but in this case it is because often you will have no good options.  If you have all action cards in your hand you will be stuck for a few rounds with weak choices.

I suppose the game is meant to be a filler with a ton of luck, but in that case it should be much shorter and snappier.  Turns take too long and you can't do a ton of planning while waiting because the game state will be much different by the time it gets back to you.

RATING: 6
Overall, this game is pretty entertaining. The decks are interesting with plenty of pop-culture references, and the game play is straight-forward. The biggest issue I had was with how often you seem to get stuck with nothing to do. That could be based on the combinations I played, but overall it's a pretty big drawback.

RATING: 6.5
Quite a nice cardgame. Lots of handmanagement, lots of combo's possible. Many different cards, takes some getting used to. Perhaps a bit too much combo's with the factions I played with. Turns take a bit too long, if you can play card after card, reshuffle, extra actions, extra minions.

I really like the idea of taking two very different factions, mixing them and having a go at it! My only gripe with Smash up is that sometimes it overstays its welcome. Hence the a bit lower rating. The base game not enough to truly appreciate this game, and it really improves with the expansions.

SmashUp! is a a dueling card game. The basic mechanics is that you have a hand of minions and actions, where minions have a value as well as possibly a card-defined effect, which are played on bases. The bases are worth points and are scored when the sum value of the minions played on it exceed its "breaking value"; generally the player with the highest minion sum value gets most points. The first to reach 15 points wins. That said in abstract, this is a game of extremes:

* Extremely cool concept - take all cool stereotypes and tropes and make decks out of them. Since you draft two factions per player you can f.i. have a pirate/ninja or undead/robot faction.

* Extremely and emminently simple rules, almost bordering on the minimalistic elegantness of German Euros. 

* Unfortunately also resulting in extremely slow games due to two major reasons: 
(1) the game requires constant counting and re-counting of base points. 
(2) Some decks are designed for repeated card drawing, reshuffling, deck manipulation and discard reorganisation, while others are very straigh-forward, resulting in extremely varying play and down times and for different player. These together brings out the worst from AP-prone players making a slow game even slower.

* Extremely disappointing delivery relative to what whas promised by its theme. 
(1) What should be a fast and furious jovial game becomes a slow and tedious bookkeeping extravaganza. 
(2) The mental demands made by this game is not of a complex or stimulating kind, it is of a simple even banale type that belies the investments of time and effort. It is it is slow and dry rather than fast and fun, and it is exhausting rather than entertaining.

A lot better than expected - but still with some issues. I think that if I bought more into the 'coolness' factor of the different races it would have been more enjoyable, but I barely considered them as I was busy trying to combo my cards right.

There is room for clever cardplay, and the whole trick-taking sort of aspect to it all is fun. I was worried a bit about it dragging due to everyone preventing everyone else from scoring the bases - and it did a bit - but not to the extent I feared. Might just be a first time playing thing but oh well. Also, faction balance well I got no clue - some, but not perfect I really really doubt that.

Anyway, fun and easy, though you have to have your nose in your cards a bit more than I'd like for a game of this scope / complexity / playtime / depth / whatever.

A fine game.

RATING: 8.5
I play drastically differently depending on the group's experience level. The group I struggle with the most are beginners. It's easy to say "play a minion and action in either order, play one or the other, or none at all". After that, the idea of this being an easy to learn game falls flat. Players that know their factions' 20 card deck are leaps and bounds better than beginners. I struggle to find the right balance of explaining rules ahead of time versus explaining them when the situation arises. For example, base breaking and scoring procedures, talents, specials, on-going abilities and what to do when cards conflict.

Another big part of the learning curve is the factions themselves. I'll take the approach of saying "pick one you like". Based on their pick I would suggest a good pairing (much like a diner choosing a dinner and asking the waiter for a wine pairing) all while explaining the basic mechanics of the two factions, e.g. minion destruction, plays from the discard pile, benefits from being played with other minions at the same base. I like this approach best because the person is inherently mentally invested in their team.

In all the games that I've played, I can't recall a single four player game. I love the game with 2 and 3. It works well with both counts. I love that certain factions (many from the base game) that poop on your opponent in a two player game are naturally nerfed when a 3rd player is added. Looking at you Aliens.

50-75 additional plays w/ all expansions thrown in the mix

I find that I like the idea of the game more than I like the game itself. It took forever with one faction constantly forcing the other players to take back our cards, so it took a long time for bases to break and for anyone to get enough points to trigger a win. I was really disappointed with it.

Meh.  It's like a typical "take-that" card game with a gimmick.  The mashed decks is interesting, but really just makes it many take-that games in one.  I do like the fighting over territories, but in the end it just feels like multiple take-that games being played at once.

Granted, if I have to play a take-that card game, this is one I'd prefer over most (all?) others I've tried, but it's just too random.

I feel like I'm a crumedgeon.  I *should* like this more.  Maybe I should keep trying it with more factions, which ARE fun and sometimes quite clever.

It's just chaotic, mathy (in a fiddly annoying way), and too long for how chaotic it is.

This is a great LCG and the innovative deck-mashing mechanic gives it a lot of legs in replayability! Once you get sick of the 8 basic factions you can buy a ton of expansions and make the replayability almost infinite.

I find the game pretty boring overall.  I enjoy randomly selecting the two factions at the start of the game, and that is where my joy ends.  For a games that prides itself on being goofy and fun, there is way too much jumbling numbers in your head to see the status of different bases(and I love Math), way too many turns where I have nothing I can do except draw and pass on doing anything at all, and way too little actual fun.  I think it is playable at least with three players, but is terrible with only two.  I really don't like it at all.

The idea of smash up is very good.  The game is very easy to learn  and to teach is well. The game does overstayed its welcome quite often. Once the novelty of the theme of your deck wears off after about 30 minutes the game is just too long. I would recommend never playing with more than three people also the games do not last more than 45 minutes. The expansions do add a lot of theme  but there is no point in owning all of them. 

If you like the idea of taking two separate things and smashing them together I would recommend playing the game unfair. It's a much heavier game with similar take that mechanics.

This is one of those games where you need to play with four players. You can play with two, but it seems rather lackluster and boring. Any effects you play will be played on each other. Once you add two more people, then the strategy is upped and actions become more fun as they are spread around. 
Finding synergies between decks is part of the fun as well. Trying to find which groups compliment each other is almost as exciting as the game itself.

Smash Up is pretty fun, but it ultimately seems to take a little bit too long. Also, due to it's chaotic and over-the-top nature, the gameplay seems a little out of balance. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing here.

I like what’s going on with Mash Up. It’s chaotic, unpredictable and yes you are subject to the lack of the draw, timing, etc. and I’m fine with all that. I really like the idea of “mashing up” 2 different factions to create a fun and interesting fighting force. Its a “take that” game for sure. There will always be a tendency to go after the leader but you have to keep your eye on the other players sneaking in for the win so there are definite choices to make. Smash Up is not meant to be a heavy game and the mechanics keep it simple. I look forward to more factions!

There is some down time in that you have to keep referring to card text but for me that’s not a huge deal. I am thinking that perhaps you can reduce the winning score to 10 points for faster games. 15 doesn’t seem like a lot but when you are using Actions to intervene with other players, it does make the game longer than it needs to be.

I will say that I HATE the use of “cool slang” in the rules which just feels false and like the designer was trying too hard to have the game appear cool. There’s no need for this and it just seems silly and contrived.


Overall, a fun experience and if you get into the spirit of the factions, you will have a great time.

Die Idee von Smash Up, nämlich die unterschiedlichsten Figuren und Kreaturen aus Kino und Literatur in einem Spiel zu vereinen, fand ich genial. Das eigentliche Spiel empfand ich dann aber eher als dröge. Die einzelnen Fraktionen machten auf uns den Eindruck, als wäre überhaupt kein Balancing vorhanden. Die Spielmechanik selber ist auch eher als seicht zu betrachten und das Artwork ist nur "ok".

Print up the base mats they really help it play smoothly.  I have all the expansions and it is really fun to smash up new mixes and see what happens.  Lots of replay with the combinations (the Cthulhu one with madness we haven't played much yet... the madness cards seem to make it one that doesn't mix unless everyone uses it).

(OK, not all the expansions... no Munchkins)

Smash up is a game that uses a gimmick to it's max and actually works for it. Rather than having one faction vs another to claim bases, Smash up let's you smash together two factions to create Robot Sharks, Zombie Geeks, Pirate Robots and so on. 

Each turn you may play one minion and one action, although card powers often allow you to do more than that. 

It can be chaotic, especially when there are lots of cards on a base, and I probably would avoid playing 4 player, but overall it's great fun if you are in the mood.

Not a game I'm desperate to play, but it's fairly light and quick to play and is good to play with gamers and non-gamers a like. They'll always be some combo of factions people will like and you essentially just do as the cards say so minimal teaching. I like the Base 'popping' mechanic of area control, but it is fairly random and so you can end up screwed without doing anything wrong.

RATING: 7
Smahs Up is a clever Deck Building game that takes the genre one step further by allowing the player to select any two themed decks to create a unique force. 

Fairy Dinosaurs, Robotic Ninjas, Pirate Zombies...you name it and it probably exists in the base game or one of the expansions. 

The aim of the game is to defeat a number of central bases in order to earn VPs. The trick is that any player can assign units to these bases to add their power to the attack. Once a base's defensive score is reached, the player with the greatest attack value earns the points (second and occasionally third can score too). 

So the players are constantly battling to get ahead at each base and some cards can destroy units as well. 

It really is a clever idea but there is a bit of take that in the play.

Got this game for my afterschool kids after watching Wil Wheaton play this on Table Top. My kids (8-9) had some trouble with it due to the  many possible actions that can be played. Despite this I really like the game. I desired to play it with my three younger brothers... The moment we finished the game everyone wanted to play again and again! Some have called this a light card game but I don't know if this is an accurate description due to all the variations of faction combos, the different actions there are, and the strategy you must deploy to using your two factions. This game is excellent! I have purchased all the expansions and it has only enhanced the game more for me. My brothers got this game right after there first play and also take this to the table regularly!

Smash Up is a really fun game that works as a solid filler, a family game, or on its own merits as a chaotic beer & pretzels good time.  The game is chaotic but in a good way, generating lots of laughs and take that moments.  Like King of Tokyo, I was surprised that such a light game could be so much fun. I look forward to the expansions.  My one nitpick is they didn't add point tokens or a scoreboard for the game.

I love Smash Up. Its fun to play. Easy to learn. Tons of replay-ability and a go to whenever I am trying to get a casual or new person into gaming.

While it doesn't scale that well, Smash Up is a great game you can pick up and get down to playing right away. Fills a very similar niche as Munchkin for me, and I definitely prefer Smash Up for its creative card play. The scoring is a little weird sometimes, and I'm not really partial to the point race aspect, but Smash Up is such a good time that this is easy for me to overlook.

Pretty fun, unless someone gets the Mage/Zombie Combo.  Too many cards that allow you to take cards from discard pile, draw an extra card, do an extra actions, play an extra minion, take cards out of discard pile, take cards out of your draw deck, add in more cards and reshuffle the deck....  5 minutes per turn for this player, 30-60 seconds for everyone else.

I like the various bases and their powers. I love the Robot/Ninja Combo!

I can see why this game has sooo many expansions! The "Smash Ups" are pretty crazy, and can see its fun factor off the bat, the only thing I have a gripe about would be the fact it has so many expansions actually. It's not comforting knowing that there is so much more content to the game if you are a completionist. So I decided to not worry about any of the other expansions as this was a gift.

Not a bad mechanic though, and it is worth it if you like deck building with some fun thrown into the mix. Definitely not stong enough for the hardcore.

The theme is not very strong... and the game involves lots of textual combos and text memorisation/checking. It doesn't play well as an instant-out-of-the-box experience. Needing to count sums repeatedly rather than having the game state visible instantly is not elegant.

I like light take that fighting games like King of Tokyo. I know this is different but im excited to try. It should be good.

UPDATE: It's fun enough but for how light it is, it really feels like there is too much down time and AP and mathing out for each turn. For the spirit and lighteness of the game, I wish it was a more fast-paced card playing game. The hand management has the same problem as the original Bang in that each given turn is simply too long for what happens. As a result, I like it okay because it has nice things that others have mentioned, but it's not as exciting, interesting, or entertaining as I was hoping and seems to drag a bit at 4. Perhaps it plays better for my tastes at 2 or 3.

Each faction has a strong, flavorful mechanical identity, and the card abilities are nearly as intricate as you'd expect from a strategy card game like Magic: the Gathering.

Cool card game that comes with a bunch of different faction decks - ninjas, pirates, zombies, robots, etc. Each player picks two factions and shuffles them together, then plays minions with numeric power levels and special abilities to attempt to take over bases and win victory points. The rules are straightforward but most of the fun is in the card effects. My daughter loved the theme and the gameplay - she kicked my ass in our first game; I think I picked two decks that didn't synergize well, or at least that I didn't know how to play well.

Fun, man.

It's just quick and fun.

Maybe not completely balanced, as sometimes you get wonderfully cohesive team-ups and other times you get horrible mash-ups.

I printed the custom-made bases found on the files that takes away some of the constant hassle of counting the cards' powers.  I say some, because when you are playing with cards that give +1 power and cards that give -1 power, and cards that fluctuate in power depending on when they get played, and bases that alter power in so many ways...well, it gets confusing.

Update 1:  It is fun enough, but it has the potential of running for far longer than it should.  I also have no interest in the Cthulhu and Munchkin expansions.  I just don't know if this is a game I would want to play with any number of players knowing that there are better games in my shelves waiting to be played.  It is fun and casual at times, but is it really a good game?

Update 2: The constant tallying of scores makes it very dull.

Each player gets two factions (out of eight possible) that are mixed up to form the players deck of 40 cards.
The aim is to score points by having your Minons control bases, aided by your Actions.

A simple and fast card game. Perhaps a tad to simple every now and then, but maybe not fast enough all the time.

Since my first play, I've been waiting for Smash Up to outstay its welcome, but keeps getting surprised when it doesn't.

Not sure how much skill is involved here, but since I tend to do well I'd like to claim that it's all skill. Picking what two factions to pair off is perhaps the biggest/only decision. Unfortunately, the factions could'v been better balanced.

An expansion or two might increase the score...

Smash Up has a real Munckin-like feel, and I mean that in the worst possible way. Despite an attempt by AEG to make SU sound hilarious, the humor is forced. Actual gameplay is a dry affair that smacks of the Star Wars: CCG.

The artwork is very lovely though and players may feel like they should like SU just because it is so pretty, (much like Takenoko).

Pundits for SU say that the game gets better the more combinations available, and to not rush to judge until some of the expansions are added. Don't bother, the core gameplay won't change. Plus, even a cursory glance will tell you that some expansions are far worse than others; I'm looking at you Cthulhu expansion. As is, some of the combinations already available in the core set are really fiddly and make for long waits for the other players. Games drag on for way too long.

The idea of this game was pretty cool.  I did not like how there was too much going on at every base so every time you decide to play a card you are going through huge, long, equations, and if you decide to play on a different base guess what, more equations...plus you will forget the final value of the base you were JUST thinking about playing on.  Also, the game takes forever.  I wish that the bases were either weaker, or lesser of them.

Even with all of these complaints I still love the idea of the game...so I WILL be buying this on iOS when it comes and saying good-bye to my physical copy.  There are just so many other games I would rather play when I have friends over sitting around a physical table.

Should have been as fun as it looked but fell short of expectations.
Far to much text on the cards to let the game flow as it should, would require a high number of plays to learn the effects of the cuff and I dont think I have the will to do so.
Foot print is too large and cards effects can become easily obscured if multiple actions end up on a base.

Make no mistake, this game is chaotic, expect people to gang up on the leader and to use overpowered combos to viciously destroy your best laid plans.  But it's a good time if you are the type of group who can deal with this.  I like it best with 3.  The concept of taking two random factions and shuffling them together to see how the work together is fun.  There is infinite room for more factions IF they can keep the mechanics fresh without bloating the system.

Very light game with some strategic factor that becomes overshadowed by the chaos generated by the multiple players (the more players, the more chaos). This chaos though, is what makes the game fun. 

It can be a nice gateway game, especially if played with the right people. 

The key of the game are the special abilities of the cards, and this is 100% text, with no icons. Idiom is a huge barrier for this game.


I have the impression that the game is not very well balanced (zombies seem to be very powerful). If that turns to be true, I will reduce my rating. 

Edit (March 14): After the second game, I start to see some possible balance issues: ninjas are great because of Shinobi's ability... It gives many, many unexpected points to the user. I don't see ways to counter it.

The game is still to slow paced. We end up with too many cards in our hands, this certainly slows the game.

I reduce the rating from 7 to 6.5

First impression (4 players): 

I'm not biggest fan of these type of power-cards & kick-other-players games but for such a game this was rather decent. I liked how you build your deck from 2 (wildly different) sets but on the other hand there is pretty big meta-game element once you know the sets... as others can be very effective against specific ones. A part which I don't like. :-) Partly because I never would play game (often) enough to reach that level.

Multiplayer Battle Line with chaotic card effects. The decks create quite interesting combo effects.

A bit slow moving on the first try but probably gets faster when you are more familiar with the cards.

AEG version: Sturdy cards with a large font size. The text on the base cards of the 1st edition is hard to read but this will most likely be fixed in the expansion and further printings. The box is designed to hold sleeved cards, each faction in its own slot. The box is twice the size needed, so there's room for expansions. The slots work well enough but I would have preferred the divider card approach they've used earlier.

It's a bit weird that there are no components for keeping score included.

I walked around this game at the store, online and in person, for months.

When I first saw it, I was really excited for it, but I heard a lot of negative reviews saying it was 'mathy' and was just a card laying game.

This game is amazing!  The swing backs and balance is actually really surprising!  I've played countless games and have won with each faction and each pairing I've made was tons of fun.

The game isn't mathy at all.  Lost Cities is mathy.  This game is great for anyone and even a gamer like me who prefers lengthy and character-based tabletops, I am always in favor of playing.

If you like the art on the box and enjoy the thought of smashing together two cliche factions to form an army, then get this game.  It really feels different everytime you play and the expansion '9000' really increases replay value.

In the end this game is very balanced [no faction feels over powered once you play all the factions; however wizards/robots has won the game for me every single time], a lot of fun, and the quality of art and cards is amazing.

Odd, fanboy-heavy, in-jokey card combat sort of thing. Highly enjoyable but probably a little bit too reliant on a 'see if you can remember all of the rules' challenge if you try to take it seriously. Unfortunately, taking it seriously stretches the playtime out into the realms of 'slightly too long'. I don't think this quite gets the balance right.

As usual, I don't tend to like these games where every player has to read everyone's card as it comes out. Too much reading, and too much re-reading all the cards that are already on the table. Apart from that, I don't mind the game; easy to learn and nice artwork. Differences between faction decks are interesting.

The concept of throwing two different (silly) factions together sounded fun at first. And I still think that aspect is kind of fun, the gameplay however just doesn't really work for me. 
It's too long for what it is also due to the fact that tracking the points can be very fiddly. 
So I kind of like the concept but eventually just not the game as a whole.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (2):[/COLOR]

Since I only played this once I will stand by my original comments. In my opinion this is not a family game, nor is it very fun. This is probably the least fun game we have gotten, I have no desire to ever play this game again. That said I know a lot of people find it fun, it just did not work for us which is kind of a bummer since I love the concept.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (3):[/COLOR]

Just played with mt two oldest kids (10 and 7) and the game bombed. We played for 45 minutes and we had 2-3 points apiece. Way too much text on the cards for this game to be accessible to my 7 year old. She is a good reader, but having a hand of 5 - 10 cards with lots of text overwhelmed her. My son wasn't really enthralled with it either.

Both of my kids play and love Summoner Wars, but SU is not nearly as approachable nor would it have the depth of SW to play at a higher level with other skilled players.
So a huge thumbs down, I am really disappointed with this game.[/i]

Smashing two 20 card decks together and seeing what happens, and how well they play together, is the exploratory hook. After that, it's your standard compete for majorities at different bases game (points for first, second and third), scored when cards of enough value have been played there. The card effects are very powerful so there's lots of kingmaking as cards get blown up left, right and centre. And if that levels everyone out by the time the end game arrives, then it's your standard lottery finish. As a result, the exploration angle to see what works well together isn't enough to draw me back, especially as it goes longer than games of this type should last.

Super Fun! Fantastic card game for adults and kids, and for gamers and nongamers! Light card game, using your 2 unreal factions in playing out outrageous and creative combos against other unreal faction pairings and their outrageous and creative combos. Massive replayability. Cannot wait for expansions. 45 minute game. Better with 3 or 4 players.

Fantastic artwork and graphic design; really helps the feel/mood of the game. 

Same game designer who made Guillotine, another fantastic card game.


Have not tried the 2 box variant; I don't see how that can play out without problems.

The capture-the-base mechanic reminds me of that of Loot, but I love this game much much much more.

This is what happens when your Munchkin game gets caught humping an underage Killer Bunnies game at a greasy dive bar on a dark and stormy night.

It's an awesome idea for a game. I love the concept of Ninjas combining their forces with dinosaurs, etc, etc...

Unfortunately, the game play felt like Killer Bunnies and the end felt like Munchkin. Especially true when I went several rounds with zero minions in my hand and virtually nothing to do.

Reminds slightly of Mars Attack dice game. But while that game succeeds because it is fun, pretty simple and fairly quick, Smash Up just takes too long and there's more to keep track of in a game of this type. For my tastes, anyway.

2 plays - I like the concept and artwork of this game a lot. When I actually played it however, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I felt the 'bases' could have been made to a slightly better quality, and of course there are balance issues with different deck combinations. I feel that you really need at least an expansion or two to have the 'complete' game and that adds up quickly given that you're just paying for cards and paper 'base' mats.

For more serious players. Takes a while to learn the cards and capabilities of each deck and how to play them/counter them. Each deck has different learning curves so some decks may seem unbalanced at first. Still fun though if everyone knows what they're doing and generally how all the decks play.

This is best as a two player game.   Four players is too chaotic, too much tracking of attack points from one turn to the next. Haven't played with three, so not sure what experience that is. Mixing disparate character types makes for a lot of variety, just watch the player count.Edit: played with three players and it is right on the cusp of unwieldy, imo. It was fun, enough to bump up the rating, but the possibility of missing something potentially critical is very real.

This is a filler card game based on popular tropes, like ninjas, zombies, and dinosaurs.  Players randomly combined two of these factions before the game, and then played a take-that style game where you played cards to "base" cards and tried to be the first to a certain power threshold.  People were constantly destroying other people's cards, so this took longer than you might think.  Personally, I didn't think there was much of a game here; you basically just played what you drew.  Additionally, bad cards tended to accumulate in your hand, as there isn't a good way to cycle them, and the one-minion/one-action per turn rule sometimes was a big obstacle when you couldn't draw one or the other.  This wasn't really my style of game, and I don't think it was particularly well executed for the type of game that it is.

Too much clutter and nonsense for what would normally be a simple but fun area control card game. Every card has relevant text, so when you're trying to decide what you want to do you have to know what a trillion other cards that are already sitting on the table do. There is nothing inherently fun about mixing cards with dinosaurs on them with cards with aliens on them, it was up to the game mechanics to make it fun, and it mostly failed.

Finally got a chance to play this with my friend at the local game cafe after being interested in it for a very long time now.  The game could not end fast enough.  I know most of it was probably because it was only two of us (I had heard that as a two player game it is sub par) but I did not like how badly I was able to hamstring myself with my choice of decks.  I know that is part of the game but we were both newbies and went in blind and just randomly picked decks.  My opponent had so much more power and was able to do so many things and constantly destroy my minions while I was able to play action cards that let me play more action cards...and I had no action cards that were effective.  It was a miserable game experience - even the guy who won was not happy with it.

I like the special powers, the variability. The thing that I didn't enjoy were the scoring of bases. It's a return on investment kind of thing.. If you put too much there you've wasted minions, put too few get beat by 1 point is the same. You want to get as much as possible out of every minion. However it is imo not possible to predict what the others are willing to do (unless you know all the factions by heart) and therefore are unable to take this into consideration.

11/16/12 - Got this because it was I thought it would be a quick filler. It's a little longer than I thought with people destroying each other but it's still light and fun. I'm giving it a 7 for now but I'm sure it'll change with more plays. It's going to be one of those games that I'm going to grow to like and get expansions or a game that I really hate.

2/18/13 - I was right. Played this game with a couple friends and they love it. The more players, the better. There's lots of screwage in the game that makes it fun with the right group. I'm bumping this game up to an 8.

3/11/13 - I can't believe that everyone still loves this game. I'm not a huge fan of it but the group loves it. I played it with my in-laws and they kind of hated it. I guess it depends on the group and what combos you ended playing with.

(2 plays)  Great first play with 4 players.  Just long enough to be fun, and feel like you are really building to something, yet quick setup and quick turns.  Also, a number of really intimidating cards that can really affect the game state. 2nd play just as fun.  One thing I am impressed with in this game is the pacing.  The early points happen slow enough that a bunch of new players can catch on a play well without falling desperately behind in the early game.  The game progresses slowly at an even pace, and as the game gets near the end, your choice of the areas to contest matter - as you can see who is pushing certain areas for their winning point.

A definite Munchkin killer for me. It evokes the same laughs, with more interesting, quicker, and varied gameplay. My only issue with it is that it's hard to get new gamers into it because of all the text. Cards having text is fine, but I wish the bases didn't have text. I can't tell you how many times people at the table lose interest in the game because someone is leaning over trying to read the base powers.

I really like this game, my only issue is is that it drags on sometimes.  I have yet to play this game with the variant of reducing bases to speed up the game.  I feel like that would fix my only issue with this game.

Just played Blood Bowl: Team Manager which feels alot like Smash Up, but less chaotic...which I like alot.  Gonna have to mark this down to a 5 since there is a new base game that I prefer.

A solid tactical game for 4 players that surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. Expansion factions go from interesting to stupid real fast.

Pros:
* Excellent card quality.
* Nice art work.
* Interesting combinations.

Cons:
* Base cards are small and hard to read by all players.
* Failure to properly shuffle your deck (7 x riffle shuffle) can imbalance the game.
* Expansions include some of the worst genres in boardgaming (Steampunk, Cthulhu and Geeks ...WTF Pretty Pretty Smash Up?).
* I will never buy anything with the word "Geek" in it.

As of 1/21/17
So I have held off purchasing this game for several years.  It seemed very gimmicky.  I own and have played Munchkin.  My younger son loves it, but Munchkin seemed to lose it's appeal rather quickly for me after the first few plays and getting over reading the humorous cards again and again. Replayability was lacking, at least for me, even though I will still play it occasionally.  So my concern with Smash Up was that this would be a similar type of game.

Wow was I wrong!  I watched a play through on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop which made it look fun, and I had a gift card to spend and decided to finally give it a try.  The first night my son and I played 3 back to back games which rarely ever happens with a new purchase.  We would have played more, but it was late and we were tired.

The next day at work I was thinking about the game and how I would love to try different faction combinations.  On the way home I stopped at my FLGS and picked up the "Awesome Level 9000" and the "Monster Smash" expansions.  I was that stoked as I am not a big expansion person. 

That night we played 4 more games mixing and matching factions.  I am still enjoying it and am going to get the wife to join us this weekend!  

What I like is:
--The asymmetrical factions 
--The large number of faction combinations
--Hitting combos and scoring when your opponent does not think you will (Reminds me a little of MtG)
--The player interaction 
--Foiling your opponents plans (I have plenty of Co-Ops when I am not feeling like a competitive game)
-- It plays fast so you can get in multiple games
--Most of all it is fun!!

What I do not like:
So far nothing really.  

As many forums state, some combos are more powerful than others.  Part of the fun though is picking out factions and seeing how to optimize them best.

We also draft the factions so you can use strategy there as well when playing trying to counter what opponents choose

As I log plays, so far they have all been close. I will update after more plays

Smash Up is an excellent game that involves in-depth strategies and synergies that make the game diverse in its variety and game play, as well as a humor that is conveyed nicely throughout the game in its card artworks and titles. Very simplistic to begin with, many players will be able to understand this game and enjoy it. In my personal opinion, I love many games that involve cards (Dominion, Dragon’s Hoard, Jaipur) but this is a game that I absolutely enjoy playing with family and friends. I rate this game highly.

RATING: 5
Nice game, old mechanism, slightly boring.

Bought the German version (because it was cheap - now I know why!), the lame translations destroy a lot of the atmosphere.

Otherwise, too much small text on the cards and the objective cards; too much to keep in mind to play it quickly. So the game takes too long for the quick filler it should be.

This is a cute idea in that you mash up two factions to get something silly, but gameplay wise it's sort of like Loot, but with massive downtime between turns. The game is essentially that there are these scoring cards in the center of the table. When the total numbers printed on cards players play on the scoring cards equals that card's printed durability the card scores points for whomever has the highest value in numbers. Add to that a lot of deckflip randomness in that many cards want other specific types of cards in order to preform their special abilities, but you either get that stuff or you don't, because the game doesn't wait around for you to draw what you need. Different factions have varying degrees of fiddilyness, which adds to the downtime, but didn't seem to add much depth to make up for it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good idea, decent execution, and great art somehow comes together in a less compelling package than you might expect.  Some of the faction combos are overpowered, which leaves some of the factions hanging out in the box more than others.  Not that it is bad that it works out that way, I just wish it had been play tested more.  The endless expansions are a little tedious, and I DESPISE the fact that some of them are meant to be played by themselves, rather than added to the base set (I'm looking directly at you, Obligatory Cthulhu Set)...But, can't fault them for variety, and for those who love the game, there's always going to be more to play...and buy.  Me?  I stopped after sci-fi.  The game is basically unchanged since the first set, and I just don't need more incremental expansions.

RATING: 6
Way too much math and thinking for what it's worth. I feel like the iconography could be better. There's so much text, but there's no distinction between an ongoing effect and something that triggered and finished. It generates a good amount of unnecessary scanning. Perhaps this could be mitigated with tokens or card positioning, but I feel that it should have been in the design itself.

An ok card game, without a lot of strategy or luck mitigation. The theme is fun, but the gameplay is just ok. The decisions are mostly tactical, with little long-term strategy or planning. It takes too long to really be a quick filler, but doesn't have enough depth for how long it is. I think this game would only really work if you enjoy the silly faction combinations enough to overlook the lackluster gameplay.

? - I don't know about this. The game seems like card combinations and strategy are required but that seems to fly in the face of the quick and dirty nature of a "shuffle builder" game.  The box bothers me immensely since the core set uses half of the space and yet there is so much room that there could easily be twice as much room even with sleeved cards (which almost seem like a necessity).

Played this at a trade show (March, 2012) and loved it.  It's everything I want in a quick, semi-customizable card game.  Draft two halves of a deck, shuffle them together and go.  Quite a bit of variety and the mechanics were smooth as well.  Just a lot of fun and I highly recommend it!

RATING: 9
It was a good surprise to me. Easy, a bit chaotic (mostly with more than 2 players), pretty and fun :)

The more I play it, the more I like it - mostly thanks to the expansions adding exponential variety.

Some minor flaws about general balance; some factions are stronger than others and some combinations are deadly. But some targeted tweaks can easily solve the problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Mix 2 themed desk together, and try to grab bases by having the most strength. Generally can play one person and one action. Sometimes the person have an action associated with it as well. The action cards generally allow you to reposition people, or remove opponents. 
Can get your hand messed up when you draw one or the other type of card but not both.
Some decent ideas with as you build on the bases to take the trick. With some second and third place are useful with others only first will do. 
While some nice ideas in the themed decks, ultimately it doesn't do much for me, I can take it or leave it.

Smash Up is a fun game while it lasts. The ability to combine decks is one of its strongest points. You can have some cool battles with friends, but it lacks a degree of replayability or depth to really last over time. Not bad for the first few plays.

First few plays were odd. It seemed to come down to a kingmaker situation to determine who won the bases more often than not. I need a few more plays before coming to a conclusion.

Love the simple idea of throwing together two decks and seeing how it works out. Issue I have is it seems to take too long to play for how simple and lighthearted I want it to be. If it actually took only a half an hour I think I would like it. I also think it would be more fun if there weren't as many bases so the competition was fiercer between them. Might start trying a few variants here. Also hoping gameplay speeds up as people learn how to play.

A chaotic card game, similar to Small World in terms of combinable player powers (i.e. shuffle to types of creatures together and go for it), but features more direct conflict and lots (!) more exceptions to the relaitvely simple rules. All the possible combinations of races make for great replayability but it might take some time for players to learn the races' advantages by heart and play towards their respective strength. On the other hand, the thematic aspect of the game is a great laugh and I for one love the idea of Dinosaur-Ninjas facing off against Undead-Russians (riding bears). Not sure how balanced all the race combinations are and a lot depends on card draws, then again, the game I played felt very balanced.

Well, I was guessing I'd be a sucker for the mashing-up of genres, and I was right - gotta love playing Dinosaurs and Cthulu vs Pirates and Ninjas.
Quite a bit of space for tactics during the game - I'm not sure how some of the overpowered cards and combos would work in a 2 player game, but as long as it's played casually the game should be a winner typically.

Rules clarifications and ideas:
*If a minion is [u]not[/u] in play -- in the hand, deck, or discard pile -- its power is the number printed on the card.
If a minion [u]is[/u] in play -- on the table, next to a base -- its power is its printed number plus or minus all modifications that apply to it. 
* -With 4 players, play with three bases
  -With 2 or 3 players, use an equal number of bases.
* For faster games, consider playing to 10, or 12 VP's.

Great little card game. Enough variation between the 8 decks that you get a lot of playing power. Surprisingly can play long though if you have certain combos. Most annoying thing is the ever changing math that is required for every base. You almost want one of those two digit counters for each base to at least give you some idea of where you are at.

The game has a lot of fun, silly art. Easy to learn, but the bases can get confusing quick. The bases should be different sized cards, and I wish it came with some scoring components. You can download some helpful files from BGG to help you keep track though, which helps. Very easy to learn and teach, this is a solid start to a game night. However playing with more than 3 people, you can easily get lost in all the card text when you're trying to remember what every card on every base does. I suppose if you play enough and get used to all the cards you'll learn what they do and won't always have to read the cards, but as it stands, I just get exhausted when I play this.

it's NOT a gateway/newbie-friendly game!! involves having your plan (hand of cards) constantly getting messed up by other people + need to constantly do calculations in your head

Zone 1 completes once it reaches 20: how many does it have now? 4+2+3+4+...
Zone 2 requires 23: it currently have 2+1+3+4+...

Now imagine there's like 5 or 6 zones out, you'd have to recalculate every time someone plays a card

Would never play this again now I know how it's played. Too much mental work & stress for such a simple game. I'd rather play Star Wars Rebellion with the amount of mental power dedicated to it

You just throw two decks of geek themes(Zombies, Pirates, Ninja etc.) together and try to find some synergies of the decks.

I'm not sure what this game is yet.  It seems to be game that shouldn't be taken too seriously however, there is a lot of card studying  for card combos that it seems a bit like work.  Seems like it would be fun but as a two player the game dragged toward the end for 6 or 7 turns as one person is delaying the end.  this seems like it would be better with more players and I'd really like to play with more to give it a true rating.  As a two players its just okay and the theme just isn't coming through.

Find game is best played with 3 any more tends to slow game play down to a point where you are bored between rounds. in 3s this game is really amusing ninja kittens vs robot dinosaurs vs zombie princesses just tickles me pink. This game lends to AP because of it's heavy text. Each card of each deck does something different so sometimes hard to keep up with whats going on. Once you become familiar with the cards game play speeds up and things become much more fun but still quite chaotic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting card game - which is better than I had expected it to be from reading about it here on BGG. The different decks have very different flavours which are quite interesting, and of course, each game you are picking 2 different decks to mix together to form your personal deck - this is the main "gimmick" of the game, and looks to me to make it quite fun and replayable. Add in different "bases" each with their own unique characteristics, and I can see this one getting plenty of play before it gets boring.

But there are issues which prevent me from rating this higher than 7. Namely, there have been a few rules issues which don't seem to be adequately addressed in the rulebook, and several of the decks (most notably the ninjas and the wizard-type ones) have some very weird effects which are hard to sort out in play, and has led to a bit too much downtime for my liking. But overall I'm impressed - more than I expected to be by this game.

Smash Up is everything I love in a card game; it's fun, it's fast paced, it's silly enough that people rarely take it too seriously and let it upset them, while still being deep enough to be very engaging and strategic. Each of the game's 'factions' plays surprisingly differently and while there are some pairs that really shine, there's neither a combination of factions that simply doesn't work, nor is there one that feels broken.

As much as I love introducing people to Android: Netrunner or playing games like Magic with my buddies, the high cost of Magic and amount of time it takes to put together decks in Netrunner if both players don't own decks already (not to mention the 2 player restriction) can really slow things down. This is where Smash Up shines most. It can be taught in minutes, 'building' a deck with a good mix of flavor literally takes seconds, and the base game supports up to 4 players for $30. To me, Smash Up is a must have for any regular group of friends, or someone who runs a gaming group at their LGS.

I can see why people don't like Smash Up.  It sits in that awkward place where it is marketed as a light marshmallow confection but in fact the gameplay is more demanding than that.  Said gameplay requires a good understanding of the relevant decks and how they operate.  This will lead to AP and to new players getting squashed if they have an inappropriate faction match up (e.g. Steampunk/Pirates vs Zombie/Dinosaurs).

It works well as a 2 player game but you really need to both be willing to try out new combinations and accept that you may get trounced a few times.  It is a bitter pill to swallow (as I found last play) but this is a good game.  The expansion really helps matters too.

21-05-2015. Rated after 1 recent play. I played Smash Up years ago with 4 or 5 players and hated it. I played it again with 2 players and think the game is ok now.

You start by choosing two sides and shuffling the decks together. Both sides have minions and action cards. Minions give you strength at a location and often times a special ability. Actions either help you or annoy your opponent. 

The game revolves around fighting for control of location cards. Each location card shows you how many 'strength' the location needs to be scored.

The game is super simple. On your turn, you play an minion and attack card. When you reach the scoring point of a loation, the person with the most strength there gets most points and often times the special ability listed. Light-hearted fun.

As said, the game is fine. I don't hate it anymore and would play again. The artwork is gorgenous and the factions are cool. The game feels fillery.

RATING: 5.5
The shuffle-builder with the theme we have all been waiting for! Each of the factions has its own, fitting, mechanic. However, the slow game pace and lack of direct conflict are disappointing and do not do the theme justice. Some factions are likely to induce AP, which makes the game drag on for longer than it should.

Smash Up is a simple competitive card game where players battle each other for points.

This could be one of the easiest games to learn by reading the rules. This makes the game great for all level of gamers. The rules are extremely minimalistic. The only real rules of the game are play two cards then draw two cards. Other then that, players follow the commands on the cards themselves.

The game is powered through card abilities. Each card played has an ability it triggers. Players use those abilities in combinations to effect the game in their favor.

Players use their cards of gain control of scoring bases. Each base is scored at a pre-determined time. The player in control of the scoring base at that time earns those points. The first player to a set number of points win.

What I like about Smash Up is that it does not take itself to seriously. It is a silly fun game and it remains that way while playing due to the light-heartedness of the game. That makes Smash Up fun to play.

The artwork on the cards is nice and the card stock is heavy. The theme is truly pasted on although is does work well for the game. This game could handle just about any theme and still work fine.

While the game is meant to be played quickly, the game can grind a bit and tends to slow down as players read all the cards in play to try to find a good combination. 


Pros - 
- Easy to learn
- Fun light-hearted play


Cons - 
- Game can slow down and grind

Here I will discuss the Smash Up expansion [thing=134726][/thing].

Overall I like this expansion, although it brings absolutely no new mechanics to the base game.

In fact, this expansion changes nothing.  It only adds more playable factions to the game and a few more scoring bases.

While each faction brings different abilities, nothing is changed in the game overall.

With that, I do not view this expansion as good, nor bad.  I view this expansion as completely neutral.  However, I do like the new factions just for the variety and new possible combinations.

Due to the that, I think the original scoring of the game holds and does not change.

Smash Up is a great deckbuilding game with simple rules and without unnecessary rules-baggage some games of this genre bring with them.

Deckbuilding is as easy as choosing two factions and shuffling them together - hence the moniker "the shufflebuilding game". Most factions are synergistic with the other factions, but there are some obvious dominant combinations (e.g. Aliens/Zombies) which are pretty strong with almost no downsides.

While I love Smash Up for it's simplicity, clever system and card design, the base scoring mechanic is what keeps this from being truly great: there is simply too much (boring) mental arithmetic involved for each player at every turn. Turns are usually dragging on for much longer than needed because players try to think of great combos to play, then count points, adjust the combo, count number again.. and so on. Score cards alleviate this issue, but it's still inelegant and requires more components. 

Smash Up certainly scratches the Magic: The Gathering itch without requiring a partner who has expert deckbuilding/metagame knowledge.

It's a lot of fun to find ways to combo cards to manipulate each base to have the numbers you need to make sure you score it and/or others don't. You can get stuck with ineffective cards due to luck of the draw at times, but I still try to make my hand work even in those situations.

I came to Smash-Up a lot later than other players, not playing it until 2017. I think 2012 me would have liked it a lot more, but this is far afield of what the 2017 me wants in games. It depends too heavily on expansions and the sort of not-quite-collectible love of combos that can be exhausting if you don't really have the energy to commit to it. It's not a bad game though. I just am not excited by it.

Full review [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1123645/smash-up-a-review-for-two-players-from-a-board-gam/]here.[/url]

The mechanics are written down on the cards, so unless you study each deck beforehand, you can throw strategy out the window. For a game that claims to be fun and quick, it was neither for us. Lots of reading, hand management, and manual calculating. 

This game would benefit from a "chit" system similar to Sentinels of the Multiverse, where all the modifiers could be placed out on the table for all to see. Instead, you must keep a running tally in your head and calculate each faction's power on the fly. This "keeping score in your head" is a major flaw, and the reason I've traded this game. I place this "mechanic" in contrast with games where the final score is unknown until the end, whilst one may make educated guesses along the way. 

I understand its appeal for those who enjoy it, it just wasn't for us.

UPDATE: Successfully traded for Mr. Jack in New York.

The theme is awful and the gameplay is derivative, but it's not a bad game. It feels a lot like Blood Bowl Team Manager or Knights of Charlemagne, but I think BBTM has the better theme and gameplay, while KoC offers a more strategic and much less chaotic game.

I like the 'easy deck construction' that happens here, it would be interesting to see that implemented in a better/more balanced game.

I'm starting to think I like the idea of Smash Up more than I like the playing of it. Under the right conditions, this game is tons of fun. But there seems to be a higher likelihood of things going off the rails than I can tolerate. One of the best ways for me to judge a game's longevity is by how fun it is when you're losing. Smash up can becomes a hopeless slog. You're getting battered and you just have to sit there and pray for it to end. It doesn't happen every game, but it happens often enough to make me hesitate to suggest playing it.

Very light. Pretty chaotic. Lots of Take That! But it was still fun. The combos are neat and unique, and there's tons of room for expansions. And it's AEG so THERE WILL BE EXPANSIONS.

My biggest problem is that there's special text on the bases and all of the cards. So you spend a lot of time reading your own cards, reading your cards out loud to the rest of the table, and reading other people's cards (and the base cards) already on the table.

Also, some VP chits would have been nice.

This is fairly light, but can still be quite fun. It's random enough that I don't want to play it too often, but I enjoy myself when I do. I've only played with 3 or 4, so I'm not sure how well it works with 2 players. There are many possible synergies depending on which factions you select. Don't let anyone else get Zombie Robots. I've never seen them lose.

Thought the game was decent particularly when playing with the kids but with Battleline and Omen in our collection, and us playing a majority of our games 2 player, this game wouldn't hit the table enough to justify keeping.

Received in 2012 Secret Santa! Thanks Santa, but turns out it's just not a game for me. The theme is just so intolerably corny, and success is predicated on knowing how to play certain deck combos. I like the latter in some contexts, but not in this one. Fun for some, just not my bag.

Got to learn this at Lobster Trap.  Deck-building with goofy combos of zombies, pirates, aliens, etc. trying to take over different locations.  The limited amount of unique cards makes it easy for new players to jump right in and some of the cards make for neat combinations.  Not bad, but with the amount of deck-builders I have played, not one I need to own.

My friends dont like it because of checking the base score all the time, a lot of text for a filler but a short play time for a serious game. As for me - it's fun game, but to play it well you have to know all the decks. If you have a friend who like this sort of a games - you should try it!

I was so hyped for this game and played it a couple times at game night with friends it was fun and seemed to have a high replay value. I got it for Christmas and tried to teach my wife and daughter who hated it, they didn't want to read all the cards and try to understand it plus they didn't want to add up all the points on a base each time. So I introduced it to a buddy who loved it and went out and bought every expansion this game has. Now my copy just sits on the shelf, we play his copy all the time, still like the game just don't need my own copy.

We love us some Smash Up. True not all the possible factions are adequately balanced and sometimes the combat feels merely like you are piling cards on a base as opposed to actual battles to the death. However, the multitude of decks to shuffle together and all the interesting possible combinations makes this one of our go-to selections when we are in the mood for a quick "take that" style smackdown.  Munchkin has ever more back stabbing, but takes considerably longer to play. We have not been very impressed with how the Munchkin Smash Up cards meld, too often you need modifier cards that aren't in your hand. Probably it's fine if you only combine Munchkin factions with other Munchkin factions, but we couldn't resist Killer Plant Wizards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
A light area control game with fighting for territories or that's what it looks like – basically it's a simultanous bidding/trick taking card game not that dissimilar to Loot, but with special powers and take that effects. Different factions, of which you pick two to make your playing deck is an interesting way to kinda balance asymmetrical powers, also it's (thematically) fun. The theme, directness and light hearted approach really make this game – it's higly accesible, fun, has some hand management, but mostly it's in trying to stay afloat amids all the groupthink and take that effects. Deserves to be bigger than Munchkin (even if that is hard to achieve). I can't say it's very original, but is enjoyable and actually simpler that I expected with all [i]"too complex for what it is"[/i] comments – maybe the ammount of text makes it harder for kids of certain ages and that was seen as problematic (?). It's really simple. 

EDIT - is a bit clunky. Rating down a bit

Played one 3P and one 4P game. Smash Up starts off with a geek-friendly premise of mashing several pop culture tropes together. The artwork is top-notch and the factions feel thematic in their execution, with zombies returning from the discard pile and ninjas slipping in at the last minute. 

Unfortunately, the game is bogged down by the need to track the effects of several cards and constantly recalculate whether bases have been captured. The mercurial nature of the game also does not gel well with the oodles of card text, and the game can drag as players often have to reread card effects when their turn arrives. Familiarity with the cards helps a little, but can only go so far. Finally, some combinations are clearly stronger than others. As it stands, Smash Up with 3 players is tolerable; I would actively avoid it with 4 players as its drawbacks are simply augmented.

Players mashup two preconstructed decks of miniond and actions. Each turn they play an action and a minion in order to conquer bases for VPs. First to 20VPs wins.

Dead easy to play with plenty of hilarious (possibly broken or overpowered) combos. Who doesnt like undead leprauchans? Or steampunk scientists?

RATING: 3
They tried to fuse the complexity of a hardcore game with the rules of a casual game and failed.

Too many times this game ceases to a halt and turns into arguments and table flipping over poorly worded cards and a useless rule book, usually in favor of everyone but the person trying to make the play.

You can play this game, but it won't be a fun experience that boils down to each player trying to do something, and everyone else telling them they can't because the rules just aren't clear enough.

If the only way to figure out the game is to browse forums and find out what the hive-mind agrees on, that should be the sign of a bad game.

eh, not for me.  I played with 2 decks that didn't really seem to work for my style and overall the shuffle of the decks was rough.

This was a lot more fun than I thought it'd be! I thought it would suck, because the marketing seemed to be aimed at the generation that has made shitty YouTube videos and the like popular. So I thought this would be a completely brain-dead game full of bad humor.

What I found instead is what is in some ways was a more fun Blood Bowl Team Manager, but not sure about the long term trajectory on this one:

* There are a lot of cool things you can do, but I think once you know what your deck contains decisions are pretty light. Combos are cool but largely novelty that will wear off as result of light decisions.

* Game was about right length with 2 players. Concerned about length in 4 player, but other than that multiplayer may actually play better.

Disappointed in this one.  A cool idea, but very bland gameplay.  Some combinations are very strong and some are very weak.  With only 8 factions, that seems to be indicative of poor design/testing.

RATING: 6
I love the concept. Ninja zombies or robot aliens? Sign me up.I also love the art - beautifully illustrated and very thematic.

However I am struggling to love the game itself as I find too many aspects of the game more tedious than fun. The biggest drag by far - the constant reading of text on each card. Not only will you spend a lot of time reading the cards in your hand, everyone needs to read every card played by any other player as well. Plus the need to constantly re-read all the base cards every now and then plus minion cards around bases plus base or minion modifiers on top of them. This is in stark contrast to games like Race for the Galaxy or 7 Wonders, where you just take a quick glance at the iconography on a card and instantly know what it does.

Then comes the constant need to calculate and recalculate the total power of cards around a base or even every single card, if some modifiers happen to be included. I have now printed out some custom basemats with a power track and +1/-1 power tokens for individual cards, which will hopefully mitigate the problem, but without these, the constant book-keeping was sucking out most of the fun from the game.

Additionally there is nothing provided in the box to keep score with. We used some random cards from another game as victory points and I have now printed out a custom VP track to use in the game but really - is it necessary to keep costs down to a level where vital parts of the game needs to custom-printed at home?

My initial rating of 6 is based on the game as it ships without the basemats, power tokens and score track. If the custom additions happen to diminish the upkeep overhead and make the game more enjoyable, I may increase the rating but otherwise - I will most likely put it up for sale.

EDIT: the custom basemats and victory tracks diminished the cognitive overhead needed to keep track of base powers and victory points, but game enjoyment unfortunately did not increase. I generally dislike games, where knowledge of the deck can seriously impact your success in the game and unfortunately "Smash Up" is one of those games.

RATING: 7.5
It should be a total stinker, but this was a really well thought out design. There are lots of fun card combos and neat ways to manipulate play.  That said, this does suffer from two of my least favorite elements of game design: 1. downtime from people having to wait for people to read all the new cards that they got mid-turn and 2. Lots of super powers that strip the power away from things, what's the point of all the cool ideas when you don't get to see them played.

My favorite thing about smash up, and this may be unique to my group, is how "Relaxed" a game can be. Smash up seems presented similar to Super Fight, play your ridiculous faction and argue over the outcome, but instead it plays calm and collected. Each players turn is usually drawn out just long enough to allow the next player to plan a strategy, making the game quick and easy to understand and enjoy.

Played twice. A surprisingly good game. Works surprisingly well, in my opinion, with 2 players. Games with more than 2p are lengthier than I'd like and I reckon the base game could have come with more than 8 factions - which are all used in a 4p game, to give it more variety. Sure there are expansions, but these are relatively expensive. Even more so than the base game. Quite pricey as far as non collectible card games go.

This is my most played game (By count, not time) and for the sole reason of theme - It's just a blast to take your Cybernatic Ninja Monkeys into a fight to control bases against some Carnivorous Granny Plants.

That said, I've not played in a couple of years because my gameplay tastes have evolved - Smash Up is just too long for what it is and it's a big shame because I miss the theme ^^. Might have to try and get it played again sometime in 2018 and see how it holds up.

Components - .9/1 Cards box and artwork are great. The rules are simple, and that is actually where it gets its knock. There were a lot of situations where we felt the cards weren't specific, and the rules being a little more flushed out would have helped.

Fun - .3/1 This game is a big meh to me. Everyone else seemed to enjoy it, but honestly it's like a really bad version of a deck builder. There's all downsides of a deck builder (large down times for people who have large chaining decks) but without any of the strategy. You either have decks that support chaining or you don't, and since your deck is set at the beginning, you're stuck with whatever you draw. In addition there is a lot of tedium in maintenance. Every turn you're spending time adding values for multiple bases. If you don't know the cards, you also are reading them all because they be modifying the values. This equals a lot of downtime which isn't fun.

Replayability - .7/1 There's 8 decks, meaning there's a fair amount of combinations out of the core set. Then again, the same is likely to feel a little samey after repeated plays.

Strategic - .5/1 The biggest success/fail boils down to what you draw. As mentioned before unlike a deckbuilder where you are controlling the growth of your deck, this gives you everything at the beginning. With that you're purely stuck with what you get at the draw. If you happen to never draw any minions, you're going to be having a lot of short turns.

Theme - .5/1 The combinations of races sounds great. The problem is that during play, it doesn't really come through that the races are together. I'm not sure how, but it feels like there could have been something to more strongly tie them together.


Personal Rating - 2.5/5 As I've mentioned, the game falls flat. I believe that if you played enough to memorize all the different card's abilities, you likely could cut out a fair amount of the downtime, but the problem is that I'm not sure there is enough there to warrant investing that kind of time. In addition, if you ever played with someone who was new, you'd have to go through that pain with them. The game feels like there's a lot of potential with expansions, but I who wants to spend that kind of additional money on a mediocre game in the hopes that it gets better? Basically my feelings can be summed up that the game plays out like a deckbuilder without the deck building build up of your engine. You don't really have any control on the cards you get/have and games rarely have you getting through your whole deck (so your play is dictated quite a lot by how your original shuffle went).

1 play, 4er, to 8VP (GenCon demo)

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The game comes with 8 decks (ninjas, zombies, robots, aliens, etc.) which each excel at one type of thing. Players select (switchback style) 2 of these and create their own deck by shuffling them together. Draw a hand of 5. There is also a deck of bases: place n+1 face up on table. Bases show a minimum total to resolve, VP rewards for 1st-3rd places, and some text that triggers when it's resolved or during the game.

On your turn, you can play some cards for instant effects. Then, may play one minion and/or one action (any order). Minions are played to specific bases (put the card on one edge of the base, so you can tell who owns which cards); there may be some immediate effects that trigger. Actions are played like instants or enchantments (i.e., they either do something and go away, or hang around with ongoing effects). After cards have been played, check the sum of all minion strengths on all bases; if sum equals or exceeds the base requirement, score the base(s) (in order of your choice). More abilities may then trigger, after which remaining cards go to players' discard piles; the base is discarded and replaced with a new one from the deck.

If anyone gets to 15+ VP, the game ends and whoever has the most VP wins (if tied, keep playing till there's no tie)! Otherwise, draw 2 cards (if exceed 10-card hand limit, discard down). Finally, end-of-turn effects trigger, then the next player goes.

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
We only played a partial game to 8 points. 

It's a neat area-majority type of game, but the main draw is going to be exploring the variety of combinations (8 pick 2 = 28 unique pairings) of decks possible in the game. Each deck has a different flair, and it will be fun trying out the different combos. The game play itself is very simple, though. As long as the game plays quickly, it'll probably be fun. I'd guess that this will be better, at least initially, with fewer players; it was difficult tracking what all the cards on all the bases can do at any given time! 

I would like to see:
- a score track: I don't like having to track points on paper
- some way to indicate current totals on bases: didn't like having to repeatedly recalculate all the strengths of cards played on the 5 bases; especially annoying were the cards with one base strength, but a different strength on other players' turns or under specific conditions
- this will probably make for a fun iOS app

This was a bit of an impulse buy looking to get something that was more of a quick filler and easy-to-teach family game.  And it is that for the most part.  With the maximum of four it can play in about 30 minutes (a little longer if players are unfamiliar with the cards and their interactions but faster if they are well-versed) and is very simple to teach although because of the variety of cards and different factions isn't so simple that it gets uninteresting too quickly.

The references and art are goofy fun but the game is a bit more simple than I like.  I've decided to be okay with that though, for the purpose it serves simple is good.

The box calls this a "shufflebuilding" game, which is a new term to me but I suppose it fits.  It's essentially a deck-building game where you don't build a deck.  You get 40 cards at the start of the game (consisting of two 20-card factions) and draw randomly from that deck of cards and play them to fill up sites.  When they fill up they score the majority owners points (so there's a bit of an area control element as well).

Because of the different factions which play very differently it feels a bit like Puzzle Strike but simpler and quicker to play (and a lot quicker to set up and break down).

With expansions this could grow to be one of my favorite fillers and simple family games.

Lovely art work and a sense of humour

...which does not compensate for a fairly poor game. You play the cards you draw in as smart a way as possible and then shits happens. Which is fine - but the game feels too long for the level of randomness and the lack of control. There is text on everything - which requires some concentration and then someone chains five things together which wipes your position from the board. Contrast this with King of Tokyo which is shorter and has a lot less text requiring concentration and provides a better game experience. Here where the aim is light hearted fun more is less.

Surprisingly good game given how hard a theme like this could have failed.  I did like how the gameplay was fast and simple to pick up, yet had a high degree of variability.  Admittedly, though, some combinations just would not work but you might not discover that until you mix the decks together.  Such as wizards/ghosts; it's impossible to make card draw and hand empty deck themes work together, so people can get easily frustrated.

EDIT: sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's not. Many of the expansions actually make this worse than better. Not the biggest fan anymore.

The more I play this game the less I like it. It takes to long to play and simply comes down to how your, and your opponent's, cards come up. Choices and planning have little affect and the amount of card interaction slows things to much for what should be a quick game. I'm hoping it gets better with more than 2 players. With 2, if both players are trying to win the amount of card destruction/control makes winning a base take too long.

This game simply is a blast to play. Lots of geek culture references. Lots of strategy and endless replayability. Figuring out how best to use your two factions that are smashed together is challenging, fun, and rewarding -- especially as the game can be chaotic, but because of player decisions and interactions, rather than sheer dumb luck. This is more fun than I thought it would be and more fun that it has a right to be!!!

A light, chaotic filler that helps to pass a mildly entertaining 45 minutes.  The theme is far too memey for my tastes, although the card art is fun and I can appreciate how much work must have gone into balancing such a diverse cast of characters (I'm always impressed with games that have very asymmetrical play).  However, is it just me or is the game missing one vital component: a scoreboard?  So not exactly a raving endorsement from me, but the game is firmly "okay, I guess".

This game is interesting. I only played it once, but I don't see a lot of strategy choices. The strategies all seem to be mapped out for you on the cards to the point where I'd get a new card that I hadn't seen before and was able to accurately guess the effect of another card that I had yet to see. As someone who is accustomed to playing CCG's, half the fun for me is finding card interactions that few had ever thought of and fewer still would see coming. This just doesn't scratch the card game itch for me.

This game is fun and semi-light once players get familiar with the cards. The first game with any faction will require some reading. 

IMO, this is a 3-player only game. 2-players cause minor balance issues and some cards (especially bases) won't work as well. 4-players bring too much unpredictability and down time. 

A typical player turn typically has 2 or 3 interesting play choices, and in conjunction with board/score analysis, it offers solid gameplay. 

The main issue with the game is the propensity to get hands that are too heavy with either actions or creatures.

The game just dragged on too long for what it is. My wife is also prone to AP when playing  games with varying card effects.  My son and I loved the art work, theme, and the idea of the game.  We didn't enjoy the way it was executed though.

For us the game was  too long and this feeling was increased because so many of the cards cancel out previously played cards.  This just seemed to go on and on.  Ultimately, while it may not be a direct comparison...we much prefer King of Tokyo.

Update:  A couple of years after trading it away my daughter became interested in the game. So...I traded for a copy.  Hope she likes it.

After a couple of plays she wanted to get some expansions and I was  able to pick 3 of them up in a math trade.  She likes the art, combining her factions, and winning bases (and the game as she has won the last two).

My wife played with us tonight and it didn't go so well.  Playing on a Friday after a long week is not the best idea. I also forgot that my wife does not care for games with cards that have different powers/effects.  Smash Up is full of individual card powers, base powers, and you have to keep track of the powers of your opponents cards too.  All of this combined into some prolonged turns for my wife only to have my daughter or I let her know that what she was playing might not be a good idea.  This lead to her having to rethink her turn all over again.  Not a good game for her but I am glad my daughter enjoys it.  

This is the second game that I had traded away earlier and ended up trading for it again.  DC Deck Builder was the first.

I would be very surprised if this isn't a top choice for Spiel de Jahres for 2012.  The rules are very simple, and it has a good deal of choices to make as you play.  The replay is good because you have plenty of different combinations of decks that you can make right out of the box.  I was very happy to demo this at Gen Con, and I'm hoping that my rating does nothing but goes up as I get to play it more.  The price point is very reasonable, which makes it even more desireable to pick up.  I really look forward to expansions for this game as there is a lot of room for this game to grow. Then as there are more factions why not try variants like smashing up 3 factions together? Robot Ninja Zombies vs Alien Pirate Dinosaurs, why not?

After over 50 plays, I feel confident in rating this game (plays include expansions). Many of the reviewers who give low scores miss out on the main strategy of the game-it is not using the cards in a "take-that!" style that is the heart of the strategy, but rather deciding when to use them, when to gamble, and how much to commit.
I think of the game like a war. There are several battlefields (the bases) that you want to win in order to advance your goals in the war (gain victory points). If you commit minions and actions to one base, other players will now have the ability to come in and counter what you're doing, even though you have a jump on them. If you wait, you might be able to swoop in at the last minute, but you have to plan this carefully so you don't miss out. Spreading out your forces can get you a lot of little scores on bases, but rarely any big scores. This battlefield strategy will vary based on the factions that you and your opponents pick. Some factions excel at quick scores, some at spreading around, some at countering, and others at assisting. 
Scoring bases is not the only consideration, as you will generally be scoring more than six bases over the course of the game. The long game is just as important as the immediate gains. Do you decide to get that extra victory point, even though it costs you one of your best cards? Are you willing to solo-score a base, even if it takes a while? Will you concede to another player who is behind you? Sacrifice a potential winning combo on your next turn to prevent another player from potentially winning the whole game? Planning on when to use your cards is absolutely crucial to success (which is a reason Zombies are powerful-ability to reuse cards in discard). The importance of the long game also helps to make the random factor of card draws less of a factor, as players will generally go through at least 3/4 of their decks.
All of this planning, from the faction-picking stage (always fun to find new combinations, it's true) to the individual base battles to the long-game make for intense games and high replay value.
There are some flaws. In the base game alone, zombies, robots, and aliens are very dominant. This is mitigated somewhat by expansions (and house rules, if you so choose), but it's there. Other factions can still win (Pirates actually counter robots well)-it's more like Street Figher 4 balance than Smash Bros. Melee balance. The rules are brief, and with all of the cards (especially with expansions) you are going to run into situations where you have to decide a rule for yourselves. This is typically a very odd situation, but the potential exists (hopefully you have friends who are willing to reasonably discuss how it should be interpreted). Finally, if a game is short, players may feel like they had bad draws (as with most games involving decks).
In my eyes, the war-esque strategy more than makes up for these small flaws. While it is disguised under the "Hey! Look! You can combine robots and laser dinos OMG" promotion of the game, the strategy is very much there, and very fun. Highly recommended.

Pros: It doesn't make me hateful. 

Some of the artwork is pretty good.

Like being stabbed in the heart, it's over quickly(ish).

Cons: This game consists of almost no decisions (it's a small step from Cthulu dice and on a par with Zombie Dice) in that it basically plays itself.

You need to be aware of all of the cards on the table that have ongoing effects/interact with your cards when you play them/the abilities of the HQs. A lot of this will be upside down and far away.

Drawing the right cards, in the right order, at the right time is more important than anything you can do in the game.

Did I mention it basically plays itself?

I'm not entirely sure how a company decide to put this in to production, since the only good thing about it (the art) wouldn't have existed at the prototype phase... Ignore the hype (is there any?), ignore the pretty box, there's basically no game here.

Smash Up is elegantly simple fun. Undemanding fighting for locations using your servants and sending them to places was here many times before and could be a little old-fashioned, if it were not for one substantial thing. You use combination of two totally different races to play the game and no matter, if it is robots, ninjas or wizards. Each nation has specific abilities, which guarantee very dynamic and unique experience with each shuffling. Match takes place in several locations, which are randomly uncovered and player with most army there gets points, when it reaches an breaking point (power of minions there). But you have no place to mark these numbers, so you have to use pencil and paper and also have to count very often. Whole game contains untraditional graphics and enormous variability, which makes Smash Up to a really interesting game. Lightning fast turns of each player consists of playing a maximum of two cards, while maintaining chance to largely influence enemy outcomes. And this puts Smash Up for one of leaders in a relaxing games genre. Yes some might find, that this game simplifies stuff too much, while others will be thrilled, that it has become game for families and even children. And then there is also a fact, that dominating over cards in nothing new. But if you are just a little tempted by idea of combining races, then you must definitely give Smash Up a try!

Smash-Up rides extremely heavily on its "NEATO!" factor (heavy breathing optional). You can tell by its regular output of expansions, designed to cash in on the latest, dankest memes. There's some strategy in here, but in tactical execution it basically comes down to who draws the abusive combo in their deck first; the strategic bits are just there to inform you which cards are abusive. Then if you're not that person, you hope to weather the storm or draw your own obnoxious card soon.

If I were to play a game where the underlying premise is to strategically annoy the shit out of one's opponents, it would certainly be one where doing so requires some actual skill instead of random card draw, and also whose presentation weren't so unrepentantly twee.

My all time favourite game. The theming is really exciting and fun. I understand why it is rated so low, because it is truly an acquired taste, but once you in it just keeps giving. The game is not "fair" - as in some factions work much better the others, but you never know when one combination will destroy another, so discovering that is part of the fun. The multiple expansions add a lot of depth.

Really just too much math involved with 4 players. The available printouts to track score for each base are nice, but you have to remember (or constantly read) the effects of a lot of the cards, which detracts from how AWESOME this game is. It's fun, goofy, and there's a lot of back and forth, but downtime is also an issue.

Nagyon ki akartam próbálni és rettenetesen kiábrándultam. Körönként 1 szörny + 1 akció nagyon kevés. Volt 1-2 szuper kombó amikor lehoztam valami dögöt amivel score-oltam a base-t, majd áthajóztam a teljes gárdával egy üresre és azt is score-oltam, ezzel be is zsebeltem a játék megnyeréséhez szükséges pontok felét. Viszont nem tudok elmenni amellett hogy folyton tele volt a kezem lapokkal és alig volt valami használható közte. Mások is erre panaszkodtak, hogy nem lehet jókat kombózni, ott rohadnak az akciók a kezében és nem jön fel szörny vagy csak szörnyek vannak benne és nincsen használható action. Sokféle kombinációval kipróbáltam, nem hinném hogy mindig össze nem illő kettőt választottam.

A great concept, doesn't work super great in practice. The deck combining feature is a super fun idea, but it doesn't work, simply put... some combos are just way, way stronger than others... Letting players choose their decks can't be fair, letting them get doled out randomly means it's too likely for people to get way too lucky or way too hosed. Pulling the decks apart aren't the WORST tear down, but is still pretty miserable, considering how important it is you be sure you don't mess up and leave one in the wrong place.

I really wanted to like this game more.  I saw it on an episode of TableTop, and it looked really fun, but I find the whole thing kind of fiddly.  Every single turn (including other players' turns), I have to read every single card just to verify if a base broke; there's a lot of "Okay that's at 5…no, wait, 7 because it's not my turn.  And these are at 6…actually 8 because there's two of them.  But the base doesn't break because…oh, it does because this thing lowered its breaking point by 5."  I'm not opposed to math or anything.  I love math, but all the card effects kind of make this exercise.

A real dud for me. Tracking all the various powers active on the board I just found to be a fiddly mess. Usually a game that makes you track this much provides better visual design clues (MtG or games like that are great at this) so that you can scan to board to tell what is going on. But this never felt like that. Power scoring also felt kinda non-thematic for a game like this. Sure you might have Pirate Zombies or Robot Wizards, but when they just stack onto bases to score points it doesn't really feel like a battle.

Everyone should own a copy, based on theme, sense of humor (and price!) alone. Artwork is fantastic. Combining factions is borderline brilliant, and can offer some interesting strategies. My only complaints are that all of the games I have played have lasted far longer than they should have and player interaction never seems to be very high in my group(especially considering the take-that element of base scoring). Can't wait for more factions.

I have all the expansions (even the Cthulhu one which makes the main set almost unplayable), and will get any others they put out out of completism.

If I'm playing with committed gamers, it won't ever get to the table.

RATING: 6
Culled - First wave; Gifted to Steve

Why we culled it: Smash Up is an interesting beast. You take an ever-expanding pool of geek tropes and build 20-card decks around them. Players choose any two decks, smash (shuffle) them together, and have a unique combo designed to trigger geek'gasms of awesomeness - Robot zombies? Dinosaur ninjas?! Yeah, and we're just getting started. Smash Up is a great gateway, in that it features content that can excite and engage almost anyone, and it all feels (at least initially) very unique and personalized. 

The problem with Smash Up is that it sacrifices its greatest strength by simply taking too long to resolve. Players LOVE choosing factions and seeing what they do - for the first 15-20 minutes. After that, the hype has subsided, the game starts to get nasty as leaders emerge and are tackled, and everyone is too busy daydreaming about the next exciting combo to focus on the slogfest of the next 30 minutes. Smash Up should be able to play out in 20 minutes, not an hour. If people could return to the faction-selection thrills more often and avoid the often painful swings of the late game, this would be an unstoppable franchise. As it stands, expansions are cashing in on the few niches left, but the game itself remains too long and thus too forgettable. 

I still like the idea of Smash Up, and we have had some fun games. But in the end, we never wanted to play it so much as to just talk about it. "Bear Pirates are awesome! Let's play something else." So I found it a better home.

Far be it for me to come down so hard on a game I only played once. But it was an interminable bore. 

The only reason this game gets a 3 from me is its theme, which is superb. Great art, great factions, can't get enough. The quality of the cards and box are also top-notch.

As for the gameplay? Awful. It's like they wanted to differentiate themselves so much from Magic-esque card games, that they decided, "Let's not have all of these cool monsters fight. We'll just have them hang out in front of these other cards, and make the players add up points EVERY SINGLE ROUND. Yay!"

Overrated.

This isn't a very complex game, but the mixing together of various races makes it entertaining.

The idea is great - mashing two separate decks to be used together. Otherwise, the game play is a bit lacking as a base breaking game. My biggest issue with the game is that it really isn't that fun with two players. At four players, there are often a large number of card ability triggers to keep track of that get a little out of hand. Best number of players is 3. With three players, this game is pretty decent. TLDR: Good game but only with three players. Play a different game for 2 or 4 players.

I've had a lot of fun with this - especially in the beginning. However, it has since then faded a lot to me and my groups. To me especially, I get so annoyed at the wording on the Cards. I have read the rules so many times, FAQs and forum discussion and some Things just remain unclear. Basically when we want to play this game today we have to go over so many Cards to remind ourselves on the different agreements we've made with many different card interpretations. 

Also Zombies and Robots are stupidly stronger than the other races in the base game.

Smash up is not a deck-building game, per say.  At the beginning of the round, you combine two different decks and then fight it out with other players.

The game effectively revolves around area control, as you attempt to gain a superior force at the different bases on the table.  As each base succumbs to various forces, a new base is revealed.

I definitely enjoy the game, but it feels a little thin out of the box.  More factions would be great, although for the low cost this is a great multiplayer game that plays quickly.

One of the stronger elements of the game is the artwork and theme of the different decks; they are very diverse.  The production value on this game is very strong, and the manual is very well put together as well.  AEG did a great job with all of the bits.

One last gripe; they need victory point counters!  You need a pen and paper to play, although this obviously isn't the end of the world.  Dice are helpful, as they can help track the strength at a base which is an important mechanic.

**I do not recommend this game for 2 players.   I am in the minority here on the poll, apparently, but there are way better 2 player card games out there.  The "gotcha" nature of Smash Up is really geared towards multiplayer.

RATING: 6
I was dubious about this game from the outset.  I'm not a big fan of various themes like zombies, mechadinosaurs pirates, etc.  Even less so at the thought of combining them.  For some the "smash up" of those themes is enough that the game itself wouldn't matter.  So I didn't have a lot of expectations for this one.

But I ended up liking the game a little.  There is some strategy going on and I felt like I was making interesting choices.  

It definitely has the potential to be too "wonky" and probably too random, but that wasn't a big issue in my first play.  I think the biggest drawback to the game is that it was introduced as a light filler, but it ended up inducing a little AP and threatened to drag way past the filler time limit.

About [thing=122522][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=122522][/thing] is a card game in which the player mix two thematic decks to form her own play deck, composed of two different themes, like Zombie Pirates, or Dinosaurs Wizards, for instance.

The goal is use the unusual dual to destroy bases and gather points by doing this. The gameplay for [thing=122522][/thing] is really straightforward: the basic is, in a regular turn, to play a minion and play an action. Yes, all cards have some effect when played, even minions, but the cards are clear enough to leave little doubts about the use of them.

[thing=122522][/thing] truly pits players against each other, as even though there are several bases open to add minions to, naturally players will try to hinder others and get ahead in every point, be by simply taking some opportunity points when adding a single minion to a base, or to flat out destroy or move the minions of someone else, completely changing their objectives and perspectives.

While it is possible to prepare some later plays and build some skeleton of strategy, there is little control in [thing=122522][/thing], as there are so many things that can happen in the other players turns that try to predict what will is simply foolish. The gameplay, therefore, is much more tatical in nature: just do the best you can with the cards you have in hand and considering the state of the game right now.

Overall, [thing=122522][/thing] is a game with a low bar entry: simply mix two decks together and start playing, with very little to teach before the game gets going - the cards will contain the needed information for during play. There is fun to be had playing, but the game can run for too long considering the chaos and tatical gameplay - it would work best as a 30 minute game, not a 50 to 1 hour (and maybe more), and this can hurt deeply its chances of returning to the table often.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Mix two decks. In her turn the player plays: one minion and one action, in the order she chooses. Apply the effects of them.

Check to see if in one or more bases the strength of the minions reached the limit - in this case, the base is destroyed and points are awarded to the players accordingly to what is printed in the base.

If one or more players got to 15 points or more, the game is over. The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What cards to play. These are usually in consideration with the game state:
- what bases are in play;
- what is the strength the other players - and you - have in each base;
- what are the points of each player.

That is because you will need to pick a base to add a minion to, and the effect of it can have a greater effect in one more than in other, or the minion in a certain place will allow the use of a nasty action, or is simply a matter of adding strength to be in first/second/third when a base is destroyed and points are awarded - the same is valid for actions, but these are, usually, one shot type of use, while minions remain on play until the base they are in is destroyed. Therefore, the use of actions are even more tatical than minions - still, the decision of which to use and when are mostly an easy affair to decide.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and very quick to start playing;
- Highly interactive;
- The different bases and possible mixes make for a good amount of replay value.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Language dependant - almost all cards contain important text;
- Play can run for too long;
- Can suffer from bash the leader;
- Has lots of take that cards;
- Chaotic.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like living in the mind of a very imaginative 10 year old kid.

[thing=122522][/thing] is a design that would leave me frothing from the mouth when I was a pre-teen and I would dedicate months of my life to it, until, well, the next thing that would call for my young and fleeting devotion. Now it just got some smiles when talking out loud about "Ninjas Zombies" and "Aliens Wizards" and, after 1 hour, constants looks to the clock while hoping the game would end soon - but with all the killing of minions and changes of places, it would probably take at least 15 more minutes.

While the gameplay for [thing=122522][/thing] has some merits, it stays in second place to the luck of the draw and the reigning chaos. It is surprising that the factions are balanced, as the end scores usually shows, even though some do go better together than with others, but the margin is low enough for be lost in our also low quality play.

In the end I simply don't see a good enough reason to return to [thing=122522][/thing] with any sort of consistency. It works well for what it is intended to, but it fails to have resonance with me, both in the fun department and in gameplay, as either seems hollow to me, with many better options out there.

RATING: 4.5
Essentially a majorities game, playing cards with numbered strength to one of several areas, trying to place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in strength when an area "fills up" with the necessary amount of strength points.

Every player controls two unique factions, making it asymmetrical. The cards have take-that powers to destroy or move or protect other cards, and there's an annoying amount of reading/remembering the text on the cards in play.

The game also seems to want to resemble a deck-builder, with a distinction between one's deck, the cards in hand, and the discard pile. But as you can't alter the composition of your deck, it's a superficial feeling (and BGG doesn't call it a deck-builder at all).

RATING: 5.5
I really like the idea of smashing two factions together into a single deck, but this game has several flaws that I can't ignore.  The game drags because people constantly have to read each card's ability (not only in their hand but also all the cards on the field) to determine the best move.  Not only that, but the number of power on a base constantly has to be counted and recounted (and again all the cards on the base need to be checked to account for all the bonus powers).  The different combinations are interesting, and it does have a little bit of that TCG feel, but there are just too many special powers going on at the same time to keep track of them all.  Perhaps it would be better with 2 or even 3 players, but as of now, I'm not all that impressed.

My oldest daughter's favorite game, and I enjoy playing it with her. I think it's best with three, so I like to try to find one more to play with us. Mix two factions together and see how you can make them work. That's basically what you do. Sometimes it works out for you, and sometimes it doesn't.

There are serious discrepancies in the factions power levels that makes who you draw more important than skillful play.

Really fun hand management game. Would probably give it an 8, but it's become a bit of a solved game in my group, which dampens the enjoyment.

Updates: My enjoyment of this is growing with time and added expansions (notably the Sci-Fi double feature). My gaming groups usually exclude the Zombies from the offer because it's a bit too powerful. This is not a game I play with my wife though, who loves card games. There's just too much going on for her.

Sat down to really learn this game and it only took about ten minutes to get the concept.  Mixing all the different factions makes for some fun game play.

RATING: 4.5
This game seems EXCELLENTLY aimed at the Munchkin crowd- from the theme to the execution/gameplay (and with a better expected game length).  It's clearly not aimed at me, though, and the "shuffle-building" tagline is a straight fail on that front.  It's trying to make it sound remotely similar to a deck-building game (any deck building game)- which it's not.  And the "shuffle building" part is really just part of the set up of the game, not of the play.

Sort of area majority, with huge swings in game state from turn to turn driven mostly by randomness of card draws.  Don't expect a lot of strategy, do expect a lot of luck.

I'm not sure what people see in Smash Up. The scoring mechanic is boring. The power swings are crazy and unpredictable, especially so since the balance is pretty bad.

For a game that manages to have Dinosaurs armed with high tech weaponry, robots, aliens... it's amazing that this one actually manages to be boring.

First saw this game on Wil Wheatons Tabletop show. A friend of mine got this game and we've played it a couple of times sense. I really liked this game the first time. I liked it a little bit less the second, and a little bit less with each player after that. This is not a great sign. Basically my favorite part of this game is getting to draft my team and to imagine what they'd be like. ROBOT ALIENS? THAT SOUNDS AWESOME! However, actually playing the game is pretty boring and has so pretty bad Kingbuilding issues similiar to that of Munchkin. 

You play minion cards and event cards to try to win certain territories, however you'll get targeted if you are winning. Most cards are pretty boring and there will be multiple of them in your deck. Some cards are pretty cool though.

I'm fine only playing this on a rare occasion, and mainly just for the laughs of the combination that I make.

It's one of those games where the winning strategy is to save your good cards until the point where it is most crucial to play good cards.

Unfortunately, there are random things that can happen that make you discard your hand and start over.   If you put too much effort into actually winning in this game, it frequently ends up being a frustrating game.

If I want high randomness and fun cards, I probably would play Munchkin over this.  It's really not as bad as Munchkin, but the cards aren't as hilarious either.

I'm clearly not the target audience for this game, and only played it to appease a friend. Predictably, it was awful, with an extremely poor depth to complexity ratio.

Too much of the game outcome is determined in the first few minutes of play based on what factions you pick. If you don't already know the decks really well and know which ones will combo well together, you have lost before the first turn has even begun.

Smash Up has a lot of take that and interrupt cards, two things that aggravate me to no end.  So it completely surprises me that I like the game as much as I do.  Sure, it can be frustrating to the point of wanting to flip a table, and it doesn't move at a pace that I would expect (our games tend to run about 75 minutes each), but it's fun to watch the games develop, and it's satisfying when you manage to pull out a really killer move.

I'm just not digging this one. I think the game is too swingy, a product of the cards not having any resource costs. You simply play whatever you want, whenever you draw it. I also dislike the cluttered table. There's simply no great way to indicate who controls what, other than sloppy stacks that kind of point at your seat or just memorizing who controls which faction.

That's sort of nit-picky, because I know if I wanted to like it, I'd find a way to work it out. But I don't, it's just too sloppy and chaotic for my tastes.

Whatever you think of, at this point they have it.  This game is great card game that allows you to combine 2 factions to win and finding the best factions that work together is all part of the game.  Sometimes you end up with factions that really aren't  the best combo and that can stink.  Pretty easy game to play but learning how to combo the cards is what makes it hard.

I know I should love this game, right? It comes in a pretty small box (at least the German version does), it plays quickly. It has a certain degree of customization and you can teach it in a few minutes. BUT: when we played this and had plenty of cards on the table it was way too painfull to try to remember all the card effects. Ok, so, how many points do we have over here? Let's see, 14 plus 2 points for having these in play plus X plus Y etc. Keeping the upper hand over all the number magic feels too much like work and was not enjoyable. An app of this game would be a blast, but the physical version will leave the house soon.

A. Lot. Of. Fun. it is somewhat expensive for just cards and a box, but with some of the added expansions it is super great. (that doesn't fix the price point though, and I think it is better without the cthulu expansion as it doesn't mash up with the other races as well and kinda lessens the theme for me)

With only one play under my belt, I don't have a fully fleshed out idea of how this will play long term, but I did really like my one play as the Plant Wizards. I liked how you have to combine the strategies of the two factions and do your best to score one of the bases before someone took it out from under you. It's strange comparing this game to Gloom because both have that ability to mess with the other people, the difference is in this game you can't stop the base from scoring, and therefore the game from ending.

Preconstructed decks and lots of chaining of cards. HUGE replayabaility with the base game alone. The game can drag on a bit with some factions as turns take rather long. 
The first play has rather long rounds as everyone takes rather long to decide.

RATING: N/A
Love the tag line "shufflebuilding awesomeness". Combine two factions; dinosaurs, zombies, elves, ninjas, etc. And commence card play to control any of three central location cards for points and triggered effects. Your cards are minions with powers and effects and throw surprises with special effect cards. Cool art. Simple filler fast action gateway. One of my fav "take that" games. Only up to four.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's silly and fun - theme is definitely held at the forefront. The options are always a blast, though obviously can become one-sided if you have a combination ready to go (and sometimes, just by chance). Cards can be way too wordy, and terminology is progressively more confusing with each expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The only thing that has convinced me to play this game several times over the past years is the artwork. Otherwise there's nothing that makes me want to play it again. The decks are unbalanced, so unless you happen to know the tactics of every deck it's extremely easy to end up with two decks that lack minions, causing you to sit there bored for most of the game.

Overall it just seems like a very sluggish, unbalanced, my numbers beat your numbers card game with nice artwork.

Smash up makes you think and makes you use your mind.  This game starts off slow but once the first base is taken over the game speeds up fast.  Its a great game since you can turn on your friends and try to stop there whole process that they have started. great game want to buy.

It runs a tad too long for my tastes with the standard, 15 VP rules, but I've found that I can tolerate the game up to 10. I'm sure that probably unbalances the bases, but I don't think this is a game worth taking seriously enough to evaluate that sort of thing.

Played a few games and it is fairly enjoyable. At first it seemed to run too long for such a light game, but that seems to go away once people are more familiar with the cards. Still, it does seem to drag if people aren't quick with their turns. Planning is difficult to do when things can change so much between your turns.

This is one of those games that definitely benefits from repeat play and a little experience. Faction choice also makes a huge difference! My first play through, I confess I wasn't impressed. I randomly selected factions (GELF + Spies) that were not interesting to me at all, and I wasn't sure what all the hoopla was about. But my teen said she really loved it, so we played a few more times and I took the time to select faction combinations that seemed interesting and powerful. After a dozen plays, I can now say I'm just as hooked as the kids! Really great game with infinite variety in play, and lots of fun!

Slightly interesting game. You are trying to capture the most points by attacking "neutral bases". All players add to the attack strength and the points are awarded for 1st, 2nd, 3rd most attack points when the base falls. The fun is in using your deck made up of 2 distinct types of themed characters. Lots of replay value while you learn the different decks.

I don't understand the appeal of this game. It relies heavily on its pop culture themes to disguise the lack of solid mechanisms. Whenever I hear this game being described or explained, the emphasis is always on how cool it is to play a mix of pirates, ninjas, zombies, robots and wizards in the same game. This means nothing when the gameplay is so dreadfully dull. Truly execrable.

Not what it appears. From the tagline on the cover I was expecting something very different. 

This is a very slow game, at first at least. There is so much text to read, and there are so many combos you can create with your minions and other peoples.

While after a few plays I definitely started to enjoy it more, it's just so hard to introduce new players due to amounts of card text.

Holding onto it for now, but uncertain of it's future.

Played this as a two player game.  Didn't quite enjoy this game after a few plays as the game just felt a bit dry.  The theme does stick out when you combine decks but the game kind of drags with too many things going on at the same time and just takes forever to score a location.  Also without some kind of counting sheet (one can be downloaded from BGG) it can become quite tedious to keep track of the scores of each location.

From the name and art style I was expecting this to be lightweight and require little thought. It's way deeper than that though, there are a lot of decisions and sequencing cards so they combo properly is key. I enjoyed the few Cthulhu factions but they tend to be a bit unbalanced on the whole. The other expansions are better, the monster mash one is the best.

In the end I found the game to outstay it's welcome. Turns could be slow and the number of powers and constant status tracking of base break points became a drag.

If you like simplistic deck build game with geeky and nerdy theme. Then this is for you. There is not much to say about the game. It's just for geeks and nerds with tendency to have their favorite theme/faction battle out for supremacy. (hint: Zombie Ninja's RULES). That being said it's core mechanics are simple but the amount of things you need to consider when playing the game is that it gets slow if you play with people for the first time. Reading takes time people. But once you and your gaming group is finally used to how the game works it's definitely going to be fun filled geek and nerd battle!

Very amusing, but takes a bit longer than you might expect given the simplicity of the game.  Penalize half a point for lack of the score track that should have been included with the game.  I had to cannibalize my second copy of Android:Netrunner for some convenient scoring tokens.

Expect multiple expansions.  The game as designed takes up less than half the box.  For the price though, a good investment.

Nem rossz, még biztos fogjuk játszani egy piázós szombat estén, de annyira azért nem kaptam el.
Négyen baromi hosszú volt, de legalább rohadt unalmas. Ebből mondjuk velem együtt 3 embernek új volt a dolog, így rengeteg volt a holtidő.

Very quick.  The combinations can leave your head spinning and might overwhelm a new player (if not a big gamer). Looking forward to the expansions.

I did not like this game.  It just didn't seem to "flow" correctly.

Great game for strategy.  Knowing what your deck can do to your opponents is great fun and necessary for victory.

That's not a bad game, but the more you play the less funny it becomes.

It's actually more luck-based than skill-based when each player knows the cards and their effects.

I was gonna give it an 8, but the more I play this game the more I want to play it. I love the theme, I think the way it plays its unique, if you want to avoid deck-building this game is propably your best choice.

The core game is great and it offers some of the best factions cant say much abouts its replayability since I didnt play it much without any expantions, but I feel like 8 factions are a enough for good amount of time.

Great artwork. Unfortunately that's where the good points end.

No markers to keep track of anything.

Boring, random, filler-style gameplay, which drags on far too long.

Fun little area control card game. I really like the deck smashing mechanic.

It's cool to have all the different themed decks and combining them, but for some reason this gets tedious after the initial discovery phase. Perhaps because I've been playing exclusively 4 player, reports are it is really not good for more than 3. Also the deck imbalance issues are a bit of a pain, although supposedly the base set is the worst offender.

Ausgeglichenes und dennoch durch die verschiedenen Fraktionen abwechslungsreiches Kartenspiel im Stil von Magic the Gathering und anderen Deck-Spielen. Müsste es aber noch öfter spielen, um ihm mehr Punkte zu geben.

A silly, crazy, really fun game that is as unpredictable as it is enjoyable.

A set-collection puzzle game.  I hated it.  Graphics were somewhat lame, theme is non-sensical.  final placement of pirates to find the "big" treasure is worth much more than the whole rest of the game's treasures.  Pirate game Fail

This wasn't as good as I hoped.  It had a fair first half, moving [b]Hey! That's My Fish[/b]-style, but the second half was part bluff, part brain melting deduction.  I think I just prefer my deduction...well, overt, I suppose, like [b]Mr. Jack[/b].

Update: Traded away.  Not a bad game...just not my thing.

Your four pirates wander the island of Martinique picking up pieces of treasure map and "souvenirs" in the manner of Hey That's My Fish.  End a move on a vacated space and it's off to a stool in Hook's Bar to await the end game.  An element that adds interest is that if you move over an opposing pirate, your opponent must turn one of their map tiles face up.  

In an end game that brings a deductive element, your pirates climb off their stools to mark spots where you think the treasure may be. The end game also brings a Magic Carrot-ish element of chance, as a player who has been trounced in the thinky first half can steal the win with a lucky guess. Still, quite a pleasant game.

The artwork is very pleasing and production quality is good.  The rules are a clear and easy read.

Find the lost treasure on the island of Martinique.  First play, one player identified all the numbers and had a 4 out of 5 chance of identifying the treasure - and did.  Good, as they would have lost otherwise as they had fewer treasures in totaL.  An interesting two player (only) game I will be happy to play - occasionally.

RATING: 7
The board, tiles, and pawns is very "Pick & Pack" style. You have a board grid where pieces go, and you have to collect those using your pawns. Some pieces are map tiles that gives you clues to where the treasure might be hidden. If you find the treasure you win, if not, whoever has more valuable tiles collected wins.
It's an interesting game, where you have to balance between getting map tiles - which help you find the treasure, or souvenir tiles - which help you get victory points.
Nice theme. 2P only.

I really enjoyed this game personally, it's almost like Hey, That's My Fish! in some advanced version with some tasty deduction on the side.

The game while the deduction is important it still feels like the game is a tad light and luck based for a deduction game. I did enjoy it a bit, but my wife HATED the deduction part so lesson learned there. I could recommend this for anyone interested in a lighter deduction game.

Auctioned this off to a happy home.

Martinique received little buzz - I'm not quite sure why, probably it's due to it's 2 player only design and that the designer, Emmanuel Ornella, is not as well known as others.  We enjoyed his Hermagor, though, and 2 player deduction games are rare, so I was pleased when I got this one from my Secret Santa.  All in all, it's a nice, tense little game.  Not amazingly deep, but at the same time, it's one of the few games I've played where, upon winning, I've actually shouted "YESSS!!!" and shook my fist in the air.  Why does it inspire such excitement?  Well, the tension lies in the endgame.  At the end of the game, everyone uses their workers/pirates to "guess" which tile holds the treasure.  If you're right (which is rare, unless you've been taking the majority of the treasure tiles) you automatically win.  If no one is right, though, then it goes to a VP scoring.  If you were taking treasure tiles during gameplay, you better be right with your guess, or likely the other player has collected more sets of regular tiles than you.  On the other hand, you can still win by collecting sets if you are aggressive in terms of moving through opponent spaces (thus forcing your opponent to reveal his info) or you simply make a lucky guess.  With more than 2, this might be an unacceptable amount of luck, but it's just enough with 2 to keep the tension mounting.  The game is quick enough - my only complaint is the setup, which requires every tile to be drawn from the bag and placed on the board, along with special setup for the treasure tiles.  Thus, the game takes almost as long to setup as to play.  Otherwise, though, this one is a hidden gem - and lots of fun in a genre that rarely caters to 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mildly amusing tile-taking deduction game. Unfortunately the whole game boils down to turn order in the end, as both players know all information as to where the treasure lies, and just have to bluff their way to victory. I almost think it would be better to remove a tile from the board beforehand to keep an element of uncertainty in the bidding round.

OK game.  Very difficult to ferret out the treasure location, especially if the other player thinks they have more points and so deliberately makes wrong guesses to screw you up.

*6* (Initial Plays)
I was impressed with this 2 player game after the first play. It's easy to teach and the play time is quick. I wasn't expecting much and was surprised to see how strategic the game was. I found it very interesting moving around the board trying to figure out where the treasure is going to be and at the same time collecting tiles for scoring. The second half of the game, the guessing where the treasure is half, was fun too. The order of when a player comes in and therefore the order players guess in plays a role in the strategy. The end is anti-climatic if the treasure is guessed correctly because players don't do any scoring, it's an instant win, and all the collecting goes to waste. Luckily, there's a variant that scores a player 20 points instead of the instant win for finding the treasure.

RATING: 6.5
Es un juego con componentes vistosos pero a pesar del tema piratil no puede ocultar su alma profundamente abstracta. Las reglas son sencillas pero no me gustan las dos partes en que dividen el juego la primera la colocaciÃ³n de los piratas  (esta si que me divierte y es muy tÃ¡ctica) y la Ãºltima la bÃºsqueda del tesoro (que me deja un poco frÃ­o, con la sensaciÃ³n de estar en 6Âº de EGB - que viejo soy- jugando a los barcos). No sabes muy bien a que ir, si tiene mucho sentido mover los piratas para conseguir puntos o volcarte en conseguir los pergaminos para tratar de averiguar donde estÃ¡ el tesoro en la segunda fase. No me gusta eso de que si aciertas donde estÃ¡ el tesoro ganas directamente la partida, juego con la variante que otorga 20 puntos al que lo acierta que aunque son muchÃ­simos por lo menos da opciones al que no ha acertado. No digo que sea un mal juego pero la sensaciÃ³n que me deja es la de un juego un poco frio sin muchas ganas de repetir la partida. Si que me parece interesante la primera parte de colocaciÃ³n de piratas y obtenciÃ³n de puntos y tesoros.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice idea in theory; in practice unfortunately the hunt for the big treasure is a bit of a crap shoot with too great a luck element. You need rather a lot of scrolls to know the location of the big treasure for certain, and winning the game because you gambled better than your opponent, even though he hedged himself against the possibility by collecting small treasures in a cleverer way, does not aid the game's replay value. Switching to the variant where you just win points instead of the game does very little for the aforementioned uncertainty. As a result, the game needs some tinkering; and if you're looking for a game without the treasure hunting, you may want to try Hey! That's My Fish! which implements the movement rules in a more abstract way. That said, if you don't mind the random ending, then it is a nice short 2-player game with a good subject.

The rating is based on the game rules out of the box; I suppose that with a fixed treasure rule it will go up significantly.

RATING: 7
2 games in one: deduction and area movement. Similar to 'Hey That's my Fish' in terms of taking the tiles. 2 strategies: a) go for many loads of smaller treasure, b) go for the one big treasure. Perhaps better than many other 2-players only games (esp. Kosmos series), but not as good as many multi-players games for 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent game.  Though the only sure strategy has proven itself to be: go for the large treasure tiles primary/small treasures secondary.  The big treasure has been discovered every time I've played.  I've played games in which I dominated small treasure collection, but it still wasn't enough when my opponent deduced the location of the big treasure + a miniscule amount of small treasure points.

We never play 'whoever discovers the buried treasure automatically wins' but one might as well.

Winner takes all if you find the treasure, otherwise it's down to who obtained the most treasures. Some mildly interesting tension in the game: don't want to be the first to have all your pirates at the bar; want to work to get treasures but also to map pieces. Breezy 2-player fun that doesn't last too long.

Given away:
The end game is just never very satisfying. Many other games I'd rather play. This is probably good for kids.

A fast (20 mins), good little 2-player game with easy rules, strategy & deduction, and a game board that changes every time.  Also, a pleasing board layout.  Reasonable price.

The first time I played I thought going first for digging for the treasure was important.  It became immediately obvious, however, that the end game is a game of deduction, and if many map tiles have not been revealed, it is better to see how your opponent places his pirates when hunting for the treasure.

A rather abstract set collection game.  The guessing the treasure at the end of the game to win feels pretty random as you don't get enough information during the game to narrow it down to less than 8-10 spaces (less than a 50% chance).  Beyond that end condition, it is just a simple set collection game.  Just seemed rather dull to me.

This is a fun and light, 2 player deduction game of trying to find a buried treasure. It plays quick and is easy to learn/teach in just a few minutes.

The game would be good for a quick filler, families or for something when not in the mood for those heavier games. The components are decent enough, for what is needed for the game.

I'd have probably rated a little higher, but the setup can take a little while, due to having to lay all the tiles out on the board, but that's just a minor nuisance. I'm glad to have got a copy for myself.

This is a very simple game that I got for the kids to play.  The first phase of the game is very easy (i.e. boring) for adults.

This light set collection game is very pretty, but it's really, really random, to the point of potentially negating players' choices.  The "guess where the treasure is" mechanism at the end is kind of indefensible.  The other part of the game is a tile-hopping set-collection thing, and it's reasonably fun, but things change so quickly that there isn't much planning involved.  I'm a little disappointed; I generally like Ornella games. (1 play)

This is a great two player game.  I love the sunset stage where you're trying to determine where the treasure is based on the information you've collected throughout play.  For what seemed like a simple game, there's actually quite a bit of strategy that goes into moving your pirates to make sure you get as much information along with getting as many treasures you can just in case you don't find the lost treasure.  Great game!

I like this game. It's easy to learn, light, and plays quickly. Here on BGG I see that it is often compared to Mr. Jack, with Martinique losing in the end. For me, I actually think Mr. Jack is WAY OVERRATED. Martinique isn't a perfect game by any means, but I think the movement is much more strategic than Mr. Jack's, and while it is true that often times winning comes down to treasure victory points and not deducing where on the map the treasure is located, it still beats Mr. Jack's annoying habit of knowing who the guilty alibi is after one round.

You move your pieces around the board collecting map tiles and items. You can trade the items for matching sets of items to collect small treasures. The end game involves placing your pieces to try to find the large treasure. There is some deduction, but a little luck can help. If you find the large treasure you win. Otherwise the winner is based on the score from the collected treasures. If one person thinks they can win by their treasures they might place their pieces in a way to fool the other player. Items randomly placed with the small treasures have different values so that randomness may affect the final scores. The victory seems a little to luck driven for my taste.

LIKE:

* The aspect of trying to move your pawns around the map and trying to cut off your opponent reminds me a bit of "Hey, It's My Fish!" but is more difficult to pull off.
* Plays quickly and is easy to learn/teach.

DISLIKE:

* Deduction elements are usually not one of my favorite mechanisms in games.
* Secondary scoring if no one figures out treasure location feels rather arbitrary with little rhyme or reason.  It is okay, but can be frustrating.

Interesting, quick two player deduction game that includes a set collection aspect used to determine a winner in case neither player actually deduces the correct location of buried treasure.  I like the movement of the pirates and the way in which guesses are handled in the endgame

Many people have criticised this game for having too much luck, complaining that the big treasure hunt at the end can be a coin toss that determines the winner. I have to admit that after my first game, I almost jumped on that bandwagon, but after a few more plays, I don't think this is a particularly luck dependant game at all.

The obvious strategy in this game, which I'm sure everyone tries the first time, is to prioritise collecting map pieces above all else. This is a bad strategy though, and one that is sure to result in a coin-toss ending. Clever play involves collecting sets of smaller treasures, and on setting up moves that force the opponent to reveal a map tile. Even if you play without the official "advanced game" variant and determine the winner solely by who finds the big treasure, you can ensure that the game goes to small treasure scoring by intentionally digging in places you know there is no treasure, and thereby tricking your opponent into making bad guesses.

Anyone who sticks with this game long enough to learn a little bit of strategy (2 or 3 plays) will be rewarded with what is a light, pleasant two-player game.

Martinique is really three or four games in one, which shouldn't work but does -- and beautifully. You've got the deduction game, the movement game, the bluffing game, and the "sub-game" of collection points you may not need, all wrapped up with a two-tiered win condition and an element of pushing your luck.

Throw in a short play time, excellent rules, nice components, and a fun, original feel, and this is an excellent an underrated game. I don't have anything else quite like it in my collection (Biblios comes the closest, since it's two games in one), and I'm glad I own Martinique.

Nice game where you need to balance getting immediate smaller treasures and collect enough map pieces for the big treasure.

I do like to play with the variant rule where you score points for finding the big treasure instead of outright winning the game. It gives just a little more incentive to make use of the excellent movement mechanism.

Hey thatÂ´s my fish with a complicated scoring rule. And my "favorite" rule of the game is that you get 2 points (final score about 40) for having more stacks than your opponent. Ridiculous. If you play it ,try it only with the 20-points rule for guessing the right position of the lost treasure.

In one of my best trades ever, I managed to procure an entire boardgame (this) for an [b][GameID=31260][/b] expansion consisting of a few cards.  I guess the joke ended up being on me, however, as this game felt cottony soft and fluffy, with a deduction mechanic at the end that felt like closing one's eyes and randomly throwing darts at the wall.  As with most of these types of games, the theme had nothing whatsoever to do with the gameplay, which was pedestrian at best.

Fun little game, but there seems to be too much luck involved, and it seems to be very much about winning the main treasure only. The variant giving 20 points to the main treasure is good, but it should probably be 10 pts for the treasure.

Based on one play: A fun two player game, where you move your ponds around to gain points by collecting treasure sets and at the same time try to collect the grid markers to help you determine where the hidden treasure is. If you find it, you win, but if no one does, it goes to points. Also, you can peek at the opponents grid markers by jumping over them. A good two player game for adults and kids.

Short and sweet little deduction based game. There is a lot of randomness on the setup, but after that is how you play and move your "pirates". It manages to balance the need to find out the tile that has the map with that of making sure your cargo hold has some worthwhile treasure. The mechanic of having the first pirate out be the first pirate to pick a location on the second phase is interesting, as you will have to sacrifice being able to get more treasure in order to pick the end first. Also, I would not pass up a chance to "jump" over an opponent pirate as that allows you to reveal a map for free.

Decent 2 stage pirate-themed game.  In the "morning" (stage 1) you deploy your pirates onto the board and try to collect treasure as well as ruling out spaces where the treasure isn't located.  In stage 2, you take guesses at where the treasure is located.  If you guess the location of the treasure, you win the game.  If noone guess the treasure location correctly, the treasures collected in stage 1 will determine the winner.

RATING: 7
Pawn movement as in Darjeeling, blocking, tile collection, deduction, and a race element make for an engaging 2 player-only game. Movement can gain you souvenirs (for VPs that only matter in the endgame scenario where the treasure is not found), private tiles with information on the location of the hidden treasure, a peek at one of your opponent's private tiles, or a turn-order advantage in guessing at the location of the treasure. Well designed, good artwork, average components.

1 play

An abstract (well, there is a painted on theme), quick-playing game of set-collection and tactical maneuvering, with some bluffing and deduction thrown into the mix as well. It's hard to know after just one play, but it seems that the deduction element is much less important than the tactical movement -- trying to trap the opponent's pieces so they can no longer move (like Hey! That's My Fish!) -- and set collection (for the VP victory condition) parts of this game.

--- Summary ---
The randomly set up 8x8 board shows tiles of various types (bird, treasure chest, etc.) numbered 1-3, and 16 face down clue tiles (A-H and 1-8). 2 clue tiles -- the location of the treasure -- are set aside; 3 clues are face down in the center area, along with 3 joker tiles; 9 are placed in predesignated locations on the board. Random sets of tiles are set up in the display -- the targets for your set collection -- with remaining tiles going into the bag.

On your turn, if you have placed fewer than 3 pirates on the board you must place a pirate. Otherwise, either place your 4th pirate or move one of your pirates already on the board. Movement is orthogonal, turns allowed, moving exactly as many spaces as the number on the tile you leave -- MUST land on an unoccupied tile (or go to the "bar" -- place token in first available seat at the bar); collect the tile you left. If you move over another player's pirate that player must reveal one of their clue tiles (if any). After moving, if you can create a set of tiles matching one of the sets on display, do so: discard your tiles, then stack the tiles from the display face down onto your board.

Play continues till all 8 pirates are at the bar. Then in order they went to the bar, players place the tokens in the square on the board where they think the treasure is (the x-y coordinates specified by the 2 clue tiles set aside at setup) -- max 1 token per space. If a player gets it right, they win. If not, calculate VP: 2 to player with more sets collected on their player board + sum of numbers on those tiles + 2 per tile collected but not on the board ... most VP wins.

Despite what some descriptions say, this is not a deduction game. The number of clues you get during the game is far too low to make anything better than a guesstimate.
Rather, it's a typical game of point collection, where the treasure hunt is more of an afterthought. Not bad, but nothing special either.

A curious blend of tile collection & deduction.

For most of the game, you're moving your pirates around an island, hoovering up reward tiles & clues to where buried treasure [i]isn't[/i]. As each pirate becomes trapped it retires to the bar and when the bar is full the pirates each have a guess as to where that treasure is. If a pirate guesses/deduces correctly, then that player wins, otherwise the winner is the player who scored most from collecting rewards.

If this had been a Kosmos 2-player game I'd have jumped at buying a copy, but as published it didn't really grab me much. Call me shallow.

An awesome game that combines deduction with Hey! That's My Fish.  I really need to play it more, but it's an interesting mix of tactics.  If one person goes for the treasure but doesn't get it, the other will have tons of points.  I love the aspect of the bar seating for final pick of treasure location.  That adds a whole new level to the game.  A review will follow as soon as I get another couple plays in.

In a world of samey Kosmos 2-player small box games, Martinique is a breath of fresh air.

This is really 2 games in 1. If you do well in game 1, your chances for doing well in game 2 improve, but the correlation isn't really that strong. In other words, it's easy to lose in game 2 even if you do well in game 1... so why play game 1?

This isn't as much of a deduction game as you might expect it to be, based on the description alone.  Since there are only two players playing, and since the map tiles are likely to be distributed evenly between the two players, the deduction part if it is based on what you know and what you think your opponent knows based on how he places his own pieces.  But since there's an alternate win condition of having the most points if one player doesn't find the treasure, the game comes down more to bluffing than anything else, but that's not really a bad thing, either.  It's an intriguing game of movement and timing, and one that I wouldn't turn down playing again, given its depth:time ratio.

An ancient legend says a great pirate treasure is buried on the island of Martinique. Pirates would have attacked various merchant vessels, confiscated their loads and eventually sunk the ships. Afterwards they would have brought the stolen jewels, objects and coins to the island to bury the treasure over there. Many have tried to find the Lost Treasure, but nobody has succeeded so far. You are the captain of a pirate ship heading for Martinique. After dropping anchor in the morning, you set off in a rowboat towards the island with four of your most loyal pirates to find the Lost Treasure. Will you unravel the legend and add your name to the illustrious list of great pirates and rulers of the seven seas?

The core of [b][i]Martinique[/i][/b] is solid, but in practice the alternative scoring method (i.e., how to win, mark II) has never come into play, make it seem pointless. Perhaps with more experience, players would better be able to block one another and keep their map clues secret so that neither of them accidentally stumbles into the location of the treasure.

Perhaps, but I'm content to let sleeping games lie and move in.

A solid entry with 2 different victory paths. Melds set collection with deduction/elimination. My wife liked it although I was worried it involved a little too much calculating. Works well as a coffee house game with it's fairly small board although setup takes a little while.

After reading some of the comments for lower ratings I think the game is misunderstood. Hunting the treasure at the end is not a very random catch up mechanism. It is what makes the point collection interesting. There is no tension without this mechanism. If you focus on clues you will have a significant advantage in the guessing phase, additionally it is significant to position some of your pirates late at the bar so you can get later guesses.

The game consists of 2 phases. Day and Night. The first phase, day, will take the most time of the game. During a players turn a player can choose one of two possible actions.

    Place one of the four available pirates on the playing field
    Move one pirate the amount of spaces that is printed on the current adventure tile.

If a players chooses to move the pirate and he takes the tile that heâs leaving. If he ends on an empty space, he has to take the first available space at the bar. The day phase ends, when all eight pirates have taking a seat at the bar.

Then the night phase starts. The first pirate at the bar, can pick a spot were he thinks the treasure is hidden. Then the 2nd pirates chooses. This will go on, until all 8 pirates have picked a spot. Then the location of the treasure is shown. If a pirate has picked the right location, he wins the game. If none of the pirates have picked the right location (which most of the time will be the case, then the players determine their final score.

This is a fun game. Lots of tactics are involved in this little gem. This is not a game for an unexperienced player.

An interesting game for two that has a nice theme and a neat Clue-ish endgame, but the in-game mechanics are a bit too abstract for the theme to come through. This is a well-produced game, however, and if you're looking for a game specifically for two that stands out from the crowd, check it out.

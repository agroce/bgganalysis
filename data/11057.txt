Simply Great! One of the best games of the series. All is based on phalanxes, which is the truly unique features of this game in the GBOH series. A must, a  fabulous game for serious wargamers, which means for those who don't mind dealing with many table results and charts.

RATING: 8
Probably the best GBoH game I've played. Good contrast in styles between Macedonians and opponents. Very good range of scenarios. Easy to play solo.

RATING: 8
Some of the very best games I played were with this series and especially the climatic battles of Granicus, Issus, Gaugemala and Hydapses. As a Persian player I won at Gaugemala and Hydapses once and trounced in other occasions. Excellent game!

RATING: 9
(Truth in Advertising: I was a playtester for the Hydaspes scenario)

Great Battles of Alexander (GBoA) was a landmark wargame, and remains the definitive treatment of tactical warfare in the ancient world. The game simply but precisely contrasts the characteristics of the Macedonian and Persian military systems. Befitting a game named for a man who never lost a battle, leadership and command receive particular emphasis. Intricate without being complex, players weigh every move and hang on the result of every die. The game can see dramatic swings in fortune, as happened historically. This is first and foremost a simulation; games are not artificially balanced. Still, most games are tense and exciting, and there's nothing like pulling off an upset as the underdog. If you want to understand why Alexander was great, this is the game to buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an excellent simulation of Macedonian warfare under Philip and Alex.  The game gets even better when you add in the modules, thus allowing conflict with the Diadochi, Syracusans, and various Greek states in the 3rd century BCE.  Out of the box the game heavily favors Alex, but hey, it is a simulation, right?  Excellent quality, moderately complex but tight rules, and lots of replayability make this a great game.  Highly recommend.  Mick

I must begrudgingly give this a low rating. 

Although the system is a lot of fun, the rules create more questions than they answer; This is baffling for a system which has been around for many years.  There are no living rules so you will need to dig through errata and many posts on Consimworld if you want to play correctly.  Expect to have to ask your own rules questions, chances are you will come across something not covered in the forums.

To make matters worse everyone has a different interpretation of what the rules mean;  So don't expect to be playing an accurate simulation... you're going to have to make stuff up as you go.  Hope you know your ancient warfare well!

In a word, "frustrating".

Might amend my rating after more plays, but I am more interested in good gaming experiences than accurate historical simulation, and a lot of the scenarios are simply no fun from that point of view.

A system that I enjoy (both this and the Simple GBoH variant), and one that I'm willing to replay regularly. So why a 6? The main reason is a combination of replayability and balance. The battles in Alexander are a mismatch; a deliberate design intent. For me that makes replay unlikely, although the games can be balanced by those willing to bid to change the victory conditions. 
Personally, I'd much rather play the Tyrant module, which contains several more competitive battles, than watch Alexander's phalanx roll through the Persian masses another time. 

Nevertheless, a game that holds my interest and is undoubtedly worth a look if you're into this period.

Just started my adventures with this game, being my second GMT experience after Wilderness War.  The rules were a tough nut to crack, definitely more complex than most other wargames I've played to this point, but they are also very interesting as well.  I'm almost positive I'll forget many of the fiddly unit rules in the heat of the moment, but minor problems won't change the game all that much.  The initial scenario (Samarkand) was interesting enough to make me want to continue this journey.  UPDATE: This is an interesting game, but ultimately wasn't my cup of tea.  I found ASL to be more to my liking for these sorts of tactical skirmishes.

Wow...this is really an awesome game...I'm just now "revisiting" wargames after being out of them for a while and I thought I'd start with this one.  In terms of realism, accuracy, and detail this can't be beat but with it comes an intimidating, sometimes opaque rules system that although it maintains the simulation aspect it sometimes interferes with the fun.  That being said, it's not nearly as difficult or as impenetrable as some have made it out to be, I think the Simple GBOH rules are almost unnecessary if you take just a little extra time to learn the full system.  The scenarios are interesting (and educational) and the thrill of punching through the Macedonian phalanx line is unbeatable.  As far as "hardcore" wargames, go, I think this is one of the best.  After I play it another 30-40 times, this'll probably be a 10.

(2007-10-31) I like the GBoH system because of its detailed treatment of how and why the armies of that period fought the way they did and won or lost.  It does this without being unmanagable, so that a typical battle can be resolved in one afternoon.

It has its issues, and one of my pet peaves is that a unit with an enemy unit in it's flank is pinned by the enemy unit's ZOC and cann't even turn around to fight back, even if at a big disadvantage.

But otherwise it is a fine simulation and very competative game wise.  Some have complained that the "series" of games in the GBoH family are not compatible, particularly in things like command control, but I point out that the core of these games is the command control system for the era of warfare being presented.  So, I expect that Deluxe Alexander will have different CC than The Civil Wars, and they would be less meaningful if such was not the case.

The ultimate ancient warfare [u]simulator[/u] and the best of the GBoH series (along with [i]SPQR[/i]) and a step up in complexity from [i]C&C:Ancients[/i].

RATING: 8
Nice improvement over the original version, especially the addition of line commands for the Persians which actually makes the Gaugamela scenario manageable. The rulebook, player aids and maps are all a little nicer, too.

More importantly there are now more scenarios than originally provided, something the original version was sorely lacking. Combined with the expansions from GMT and C3I, players now have a lot more choice for scenarios instead of being relegated to playing losers like Granicus.

There are a couple minor/fiddly issues. The rally mechanism is definitely questionable from a historical perspective. In ancient warfare once a unit broke, it broke. It was [i]extremely[/i] rare for units to be rallied afterwards. Fortunately, this is something that doesn't happen a great deal in practice. The missile-low/missile-no rules are mostly silly, unnecessary and ahistorical. I pretty much only use it for javelin troops.

The one potentially major issue that annoys some people is the leader activation/momentum/trump mechanic. Here you either love it or leave it. Every once in a great while the Macedonians and the dice don't get along, and then you get some wonky results. But, for the most part, I think it works pretty well.

First realized now that there's a Deluxe entry as well as a normal one. :/ I have played them both but not sure the update needs its own entry?

Great game but fiddly at times. The rules are shiny with chrome as well. Try the Simple GBoH for a different and faster game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice system, though difficult to pick up at first due to all the chrome and some vagueness in the rules. Better than average Berg. Most of the scenarios are terribly unbalanced and for historical interest only.

**UPDATE**  I've noticed that this game is getting a lot more table time now that I've picked up the Simple GBoH ruleset. I think I actually prefer the game using the simple rules, as it plays much faster and still involves a lot of tough decisions and a sound strategy. Using the simple rules, I'd rate this game a 9.

As a board game these are fun to play but as ancient battle simulators I have some concerns about the behaviours I see on the battlefield. For example, I see too many incidences of a Macedonian Phalanx routing, only to be rallied very soon thereafter. 

I've not seen this at all in the history books. I suspect that if a real phalanx had routed, it would be gone for good...

Still, this series is fun to play, well researched and the most accurate simulation of ancient warfare that is currently available.

Excellent combination of game and sim.  Difficult to defeat the Macedonian phalanx, but that reflects the reality of the 4th Century BCE. Game clearly demonstrates not only the "firepower" advantages of the Macdonians, but also their superior "command and control" compared with their Persian opponents.  It's possible to win with the Persians as well.  A favorite.

Very Good: Tactical - Ancients - Easy

Pls note I have only played using the Simple Great Battles rules
Plus:
-Excellent components
-Simple GboH is a very accessible and sophisticated system. Not too difficult, not to simple. Just right for my taste
-Good set of scenario's
-Battles play in 3-4 hours, dependin on the scenario
-High replay value

Minus:
-Balance in certain battles :
-Ancient warfare is not my favorite era, I prefer Napoleoninc tactical toancient warfare. 
This volume gives an excellent nsight in the battles that were fought these days with a variety of weaponary and unit types. This is for those who want a more realistic depiction of a battle than Command & Colors Ancients. If I have little time I will play C&C:A but if I have an evening / afternoon I rahter play this. 

Have had no desire to play for a long time. I got a good offer and decided to sell it.

Sold it.

Wargame about the battles of Alexander the Great. My rating refers to the first deluxe version of the game, which GMT published some years after (very) the first edition of Alexander. The deluxe version adds physical components in the same (beautiful!) style as that of SPQR and the subsequent games in the series, and also a bunch of new scenarios, most quite small. IMHO, the scenarios are best appreciated using the Simple GBoH rules.

Interesting game which recreates the battles of the Ancient World in just a few hours. Some of its mechanisms (activation of only 1 formation per turn for example) are counterintuitive at first glance but do seem to work. Most of the scenarios are seriously lobsided though. A possible solution would be to crack open a WWII tactical game and place a few of the counters it contains (for example some Britsh paratroopers or a Russian shock army platoon) in the Persian battle line. But even then, with Alexander's obscene initiative rating I doubt if they stand a chance.

UPDATE:  Have now played a couple of scenarios and this is rapidly turning into one of my favourite systems (Simple GBoH) -- I miss some of the chrome present in the original rules, but Simple is so much more playable. 

Can't wait for the next game -- have started collecting the various modules.

Worth getting as a companion to the movies/books/whatever if you're into Alexander in general (cutie boy ;)

RATING: 8
The Deluxe edition was first released in 1995.  This is the second "deluxe" edition, covering the same scenarios of the first deluxe edition.  

I played the Granicus River scenario in this game using the Simple Great Battles of History rules. It was a kind of boom!  All nomenclature or concepts of the classical battle was covered: shock troops, phalanx, hoplites, front ranks, no-man's land, close-in, hand-to-hand fighting, push, spear thrusting, slingers, encirclement, outflanking, charging, morale, cohesion, rout....Oh man!  I knew all of them by playing this wargame!  

I also suggest to read the first chapter Gaugamela, October 1, 331 B.C. in Victor Hanson's book "Why the West Has Won".  His detailed description of the battle cause me to stifle it out in my closet of games.  It seems everything he mentioned in the book is covered completely in this masterpiece wargame. More is learned when I play a new scenario. 

A large part of wargaming is to recreate history, an authentic ancient warfare history. To that end, the GBoH series and the system serve it good. People say the system doesn't offer many choices to the players. As a game, players are deserved to look for that. I do think, however, there is a choice in the initial phase before both sides close in and contact - and that is, whether to withdraw a sector (be it center, left or right flank) for a subsequent envelopment. Ancient warfare is all about this. And whether that envelopment can happen depends on the leadership on the battlefield. 

The process of modifications to the dieroll result in GBoH can be quite mechanical without question and to a certain extent dry. SGBoH is pretty much a perfect streamlining model and feel-the-flow stuff. If you want more movements, Lost Battles is an excellent choice with more abstraction of the ancient warfare and easier forces disengagement process. It does give you more choices (at least on paper however illusory it is), less goofs.

This and the rest of GBoH has to be the daddy of ancients wargaming. Nails the period and the command mechanics. GBoA is very rules heavy but that delivers realism. I got Simple GBoH off the back of this to make it work for me in terms of time required.

Excellent package including 10 different battles, with different scenarios on each, and units for quite a few races. Theres a lot of fun to be had exploring everything this game has to offer. 
The rules are a little tough to crack at first but its actually suprisingly fast playing when you get the rules down.
What stops me rating this higher is the lack of clarity in many of the rules. For a game in its fourth edition this is pretty hard to forgive, especially when many of these issues have never been addressed in any form of errata or even in the 7000+ topics on the series at consimworld. A certain amount of "interpret your own rules" seems to be expected here. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
After a couple of walk throughs of the Chaeronea scenario. The basics work OK, but there's a lot of flipping of counters and placing/removing of chits. Given the scale I suppose that's to be expected. The rout/rally of skirmishers is a bit wacky - they come bouncing back to life with little or no loss from their starting strength way too easily. I also don't like the total lack of casualties from combat, as units can recover cohesion way too easily. OK, but not great, although we'll have to play some more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Definitive game of conquest of the world - pre Roman era.  Alexander's battles are meticulously presented in all their glorious detail.  Encyclopedic detail!  Great system of battle puts you in command of the leaders whose abilities move the units.  The difference between the disciplined Greeks and the forces that opposed them are distinct.

Awesome game - highly recommended.  The deluxe edition includes the 90s expansion.

Note I rank this heavy not because it's difficult to play the system, but because you will have a heavy time investment to play well.

Beautiful game, complex enough but simpler than just about any other GBoH.  Historical scenarios very, very unbalanced in favor of Alex, though a little tinkering can balance competitive play.  Not as interesting or as well supported as SPQR, but much better as an introduction and easier to play.  Almost no errata - from a game over 10 years old!

Dislikes - Hard to read charts, particularly the CRTs.  Rout conditions fixed - would have preferred a variable or sliding scale system.  Not as well supported with modules/scenarios as SPQR.

Date of comment: April 2010

UPDATE:

I’ve just played the meeting engagement scenario at Issus: My experience confirmed that the GBoH system is really not made to simulate Armies movement towards the battlefield. [You can also experience this in the Dara –Cataphract- scenario.] Of course, I rolled poorly for Momentum: Two “8” for Alexander and even two “9” for Parmenion, thus triggering a retreat during the deployment of the Macedonian Army! The end result was a complete chaos in face of the Persian Army. Darius had plenty of time to retreat his infantry behind the Pinarus River and move his Bactrian CAT HC to reinforce weak spots in the defenses! My opponent even regretted being so cautious in face of this complete mess! We were able to make only a few indecisive fights, so I cannot comment on the possible issue of the scenario.

SUMMARY:

This Series offers beautiful components and many scenarios that are often well researched, but the command system is totally unrealistic: Too bad! :-(

With the addition of Tyrant this is probably a better introduction to the serie than SPQR. The rules are slightly simpler, especially command and control and all the special rules for the legions, you got a lot of smaller battles and they seem, in Tyrant, fairly balanced. My only gripe with the system is the phalanxes, they often feel like a liability, not really an asset but it is probably because I don't use them properly.

Overall this game is good, but there are too many fiddly details in the full blown version.  "S"GBOH is better for this game in particular.  I also have some issues with a few of the scenario setups and particulars....the Macedonian system was superior, but it is so built-in to the game that the Macedonian player could eat a bunch of his own counters and still win moving the others randomly.  A little more sensitivity to player decision making should have been inserted into the system.

And don't get me started on hexspine facing...

One brutal playing of the introductory scenario. Lots of rules checking with extensive page turning. Rating will likely go up if I can overcome the convoluted rules. The play aids are also incomplete with more rules searching ensuing. Either the rules are poorly organized or there are just too many exceptions; maybe both.

An awful lot of rules that seem to indicate that the 'players' are merely the implementers of the mechanics of the game-driven destruction of the opposing armies once the orders to engage are given. Realism at the cost of fun?

The Granicus proved to be more interesting but still with excessive rules checking. A number of 'features' could have used 'less cute' and more informative Designers' comments.

I originally rated this game a 6 when I was using the Simple Great Battles of History rules, but now that I'm using the regular series rules, I've upped it to 7.  Why?  Well, I'm no historian, but I really love the feel of the combat system.  It definitely puts me in the frame of mind of what I think ancient combat was like.  Also, the command system is superior to that in the SGBoH set.  The regular series just simply have more flavor.

Very nice game - my first foray into world of GBoH... and I`ve stayed there to this day.

Fascinating battles with one of my favorite ancient characters. What I really like with Alexander is that almost in any scenario players are able to maneuver before decisive clash - you can rearrange your forces, try to win on the flank... many possibilities and usually different outcome in every game.

I`ve seen how Alexander loses, I`ve seen how he has won. Thanks GMT!

Though my edition is from 1995 - bought here at boardgamegeek marketplace.

This is a great game which "feels right" in its portrayal of ancient warfare. I started using the third edition rules; the fourth edition (harass and dispersal) really changes the punch of light troops, and therefore the game. The historiical research and variants - especially the variants - are interesting. Would like a campaign game; perhaps I will get the Ancients series from GMT and then play out battles with this one.

Following refers to original GBOH:

One of the first complex games I learned, and one I keep coming back to.  In part because it is excellent for solitaire play.  Emphasizes tactical maneuver and "system superiority", as there isn't much spread in the results of the CRT.  Which puts a premium on getting position on enemy units or putting better type units on inferior ones.  The command system breaks up the Igo-ugo routine nicely and puts some interesting decisions in your hands on when to go for momentum and when to trump with superior commanders.  

Rulebook should be lot better for a 4th edition in regards to clarity and organization. Makes learning the game much harder than it should be.  Previously rated the game an "8" b/c of it. Game plays smoothly once you know the rules with units quickly routing off the board.  

All battles are historical and hence several are not balanced, with a heavily favored side.  However, the bigger and historically important battles in this base game are fairly balanced, as are most in Tyrant. Best thing for the less balanced ones is to bid rout points for the favored side.

A big positive for the series is the number of battles you can get with the Deluxe edtions, plus expansions, plus scenarios in c3i, (GMT's mag supporting their games).  Also the c3i Ops website has uploaded all the GBOH scenarios from OOP issues.  You can download them for free.

Highly recommend the Tyrant expansion.  

I've played with the Simple rules which are misnamed, it should be Alternative, AGBOH. They translate combat factors into die roll modifiers.  This to me makes combat tedious as then there is a long list of drms to go through.  The command structure simplified, is really just IGO-UGO with a few "trumping" opportunities.  You command much larger formations.  The upside is it plays faster.

RATING: 7
An old warhorse of the hex-and-counter Ancients genre and (along with SPQR for the Romans) the progenitor of GMT's enormous Great Battles of History series. But I don't think it entirely lives up to its reputation.

The strong point of the game is developing a strategy around troop differentiation and then maneuvering your units to maximize their effect. Combat results are heavily influenced by positional superiority along with a comprehensive matrix detailing the relative efficacy of the various weapon systems of the era. And a slew of special rules apply to different units, allowing them to bend the core system rules in various ways. You really need to know your troops and use them properly in order to be an effective commander, which is as it should be.

But the flipside of this is an extremely exception-heavy ruleset, which is hindered further by sloppy editing. Just about every troop type in any scenario has at least a handful of special rules to remember, and the really unusual ones have even more. Furthermore, like most Berg games I've played, the rules don't usually spell out the interactions very clearly and are rife with editing errors and odd organization. This edition (itself based on a 15 year old design) has been out for 5 years and there are still regular revisions and clarifications as issues come up on CSW. It's just not a ruleset that inspires much confidence. Again like most Berg games, I can't help but feel that 95% of the effect could have been achieved for 60% of the effort if the rules were streamlined a bit. I haven't yet tried the "Simple" variant of the system, but I may give that a go and see if it helps.

Also, for all the fiddliness of the system, it still isn't much of simulation. The command system in particular, while enjoyable, is rather gamey. And the use of Cohesion Points to represent both casualties as well as formation integrity leads to strange situations where units take terrific beatings, rout away, and rally back the very same turn nearly as good as new. As a game it works fine, but I think the system is much less simulationist than it's usually made out to be.

Still, I do expect to play this some more and would recommend it to people interested in the era. It has lots of flavor and tense moments, and you can play out some interesting battles in a reasonable time frame. It's also a terrific value, with ten varied battles packed into the box. But I don't think it's the definitive tactical Ancients game it's made out to be. 

Update: Played a few more scenarios. Love the scenarios - great fun. But the rules questions never stop. It's *so* much more work to play this game than it should be.

After two plays, (finally, after trying to get together with a player who knows the system, for over a year), I found enjoyment through working the system of Command.  I am thinking of "doubling" all damage, so that the incremental losses occur more rapidly, and the game time is halved, through this process.

This wargame is a good recreation of Alexander's battles. You cant go in with the idea that you're going to win as the enemies of Alexander as the battles are heavily weighted towards him.

Deluxe Alex is the definitive Ancient Tactical Battle wargame covering Philip II and the Alexandrian era from the rise of Macedon until the death of Alexander and through the Diadochi period. 

Players must learn both what troops are good for as well as bad at AND how to use/reuse his given leaders. Especially important regarding use of leaders is when to/not to use the trump option during each leader's activation. This mechanic is utilized by RHB in many of his games and his widely misunderstood by many of his detractors.

The GBoH system (of which Deluxe Alexander is merely one part) stands as the mark by which all other tactical ancient battle games/systems are measured.

RATING: 7.7
This belongs to my all time top30. A card driven worker placement where the theme is surprisingly well integrated. The weather forecast for the upcoming round helps to make tactical decisions. Maybe best with 3 players but 2  and 4 work well also. We haven't tried with 5.

I like the artwork a lot. I also enjoyed my few plays of the game (two 2-player games and one 5-player game), but I feel its replayability is limited by the relatively low number of options during the game.

Theme not too exciting. Bit confusing rules regarding where to place your guests. It felt like a too complex game for a the small game it is, and too light to be a serious game.

A lightweight Sun, Sea, and Sand homage, Letnisko gives you plenty of entertaining decisions and a bit of look ahead to keep it interesting.  But it doesn't really vary things up enough for as long as it runs to be as solid as the game it's modelled after.

RATING: 8
Very good with 4 as it limits the number of actions you can do. With 3 - optimal - as it still leaves you lots of possibilities and does not block you as it does happen with 4, OK with 2. Only few options, only few decisions, however the game is tense :) Every move can change the balance and the leader. Something like alien frontiers. 
Letnisko made very good impression on us. Easy to learn hard to master!

Build your holiday resort in pre-WW2 Poland. The weather deck provides a different game each time you play it and it plays within the hour.

The number of workers you deploy in one action determines the cost and since you only have two you have to manage them well.

Initially I passed on this, but on second thought I really want to get this to the table regularly.

I'm really glad I located a copy, this is a fun and light worker placement card game that doesn't overstay it's welcome. I like the use of a weather mechanic for shifting supply of vacationers.

Very nice adherence to theme and a somewhat unusual theme, but please add more cowbell. 

That is, there are not enough strategic paths and there is not enough variability in play conditions. So each playing is pretty much like the last with only a little variation in the order of the weather cards. You always have the same basic aims with just some tactical variability.

The Start player on turn 1 has a noticeable advantage.

Best with many players, but better to play Sun, Sea & Sand.

Meh.

Light family game.  It works, but why play this one while there are dozens of better games in its category?  The lack of decent control is one of the main problems.  Apart from that 'Letnisko' doesn't have a spark, interesting twists or ideas and fails to bring any excitement.  

Maybe it's better with less than 5 players (I played only with 5), but I don't feel like trying any time soon...

The bidding (shopping) rules are a bit convoluted, but the gameplay is interesting and fast.
Maybe the theme is not so charming, guess a Theme Park retheme with some twists (ex. Gadgets House) could do the trick.

Nice short game with unusual historical theme!

I was a translator. (Note that a clarification was added to the Polish rules afterward which isn't in the English: passengers who were not invited by a player will stay in their train wagons, and might be claimed (along with future passengers) in a later turn.)

Tangential note: I highly approve of Letnisko's shelf-friendly and environment-friendly small square box; too many publishers put similar games in much larger boxes mostly full of air.

Fantastic little game with clever use of cards, ideal travel size, doesn't take too much table space and super duper thematic. As of right now, it's one of my favorite card games that I have played in a while. Imo, this is a criminally underrated game and more people should look into it. It works great as a gateway but I think serious playersmcan also appreciate it's subtleties. I love the Theme (super interesting and forgotten Era), the artwork, the simple rules, the clever mechanisms, and it has nice decisions throughout. This game has really exceeded my expectations and I am loving it.

Turn order is extremely important - avoid playing with 5 and probably even with 4.  Rating with 5 would be more like a '4', but I believe it's enough better with only 3 players to justify a higher rating.

I like bringing worker placement to a game purely made from cards so that aspect of the design is neat, but the gameplay is pretty lacking - insufficient options to really allow significant room for clever play.

Light game for everyone. Nothing wrong in here, nothing exciting either. Hand managment with a bit of luck. I felt no fun, just optimising. And light games should be fun! For casual players only.

In Letnisko players take on the role of couples running 1930's era resorts on the outskirts of Warsaw.  As the player's role might suggest, this is an economic worker-placement game.  As resort owners you:  Expand your resort facilities to draw more guests.  Improve your resort facilities to attract richer clientèle.  Hope for good weather so the trains from the city are full of vacationers.  Solicit vacationers at the train station to your resort.  At the end of the season the resort that made the most money is the victor.

All components except for the worker tokens are cards.  I like how the guest cards have a flip side that act as currency and reflect what the guest will pay; clever dual utility.  The art is great throughout and evokes  tranquil vacations from a bygone era.  An economic game that also happens to have good economy in components, game box size, table space, playing time, and price.  An elegant design with a pleasantly quaint theme.  I look forward to many more plays.

P.S. - Don't forget to check out the [url=http://www.andriollowka.pl/images/pdf/107_web.pdf]historic notes in english[/url] (the game only came with historic notes in Polish).

Quick card game where players develop a summer holiday location. Each turn the number of houses and the weather together determine the number and type of people that will take the train and visit your resort. 
Players place their workers to either improve their resort, or collect visitors from the train, trying to collect the most money. 
Art is very good, but game is a little more luck based than I expected.

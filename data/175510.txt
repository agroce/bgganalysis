This is a X3 game. You have to conquer, build and prosper. This game is mean. 

You can do up to 3 actions in a turn and they can be : Steal a token + Conquer an enemy territory + Steal a Lord (devotion card).
In terms of points, it means that it is 3 "points" (actually the Victory Point system is not that simple, but for the sake of simplicity, I will ignore the complex part) more for you and 3 "points" less for your opponent... The gap is 6 HUGE points!
Someone will cry if you do this trick 3 times in a row.

However, it is one of the best art ever. The gameplay is actually well geared. 

The only problem is how it ends. There are a few messages about it on BGG forum. I proposed an alternative ending which I prefer over the official one.

Interesting game.  Minimal components (but not exactly a microgame).  There's some interesting decisions that have to be made about which Lords to acquire and how to play cards while discarding others.  There's something all a little funky to it though which prevents it from being a highly fluid card game. The pace just feels a bit off.  Artwork is beautiful of course! "Area Control" mechanic felt almost non-existent, even though it's there. A rather confrontational game, so you have to be ready for that. Interesting scoring mechanism.  Opportunities for bashing the leader are great, which worries me, especially during the last turn. Overall, an interesting experience as card games go.

Pledged on Kickstarter on April 4th, 2015 - Estimated delivery May 2015. Only found positive comments about SmallBox Games and their previous games/Kickstarters, and Soulfall seems to have a nice Terra Mystica/Small World-lite vibe to it, which I am very interested in. For $30 and delivery next month, hard to pass on.

--
June 3rd, 2015 - Arrived safe and sound today with none of the box damage issues or ripped counters that some other backers have complained about. The box lid doesn't fit tight, but I'm not terribly concerned about that - I'll put an elastic or something around to hold it on and it will be fine. Artwork is stunning in real life, I'm really looking forward to breaking the game in.

Well run Kickstarter, lovely art, good quality cards.  Box is ... interesting.  On first run through there seem to be some quite large swings in scores possible some turns fairly randomly.  And not sure about the endgame.  Maybe it will be clearer after more than one play.

A very quick to play strategic placement game that surprised us with how quickly the tides could turn (pun sort of intended). The mechanics wound up being very use it or lose it, constantly shifting the momentum of the players.

We enjoyed it a great deal, and the only downside I can foresee to having it in our collection is the quality of the cardboard pieces standing up over time. I really don't want the art (which is gorgeous) to mar over time and a thin laminate or screen cover feels like it would improve the longevity of the pieces over use. Which I expect to get a lot of!

RATING: 5
Amazing art, but I fear it's too tactical? Or something? Not like I usually dislike tactical games, this one just felt kind of unmoored. A bad scoring mechanism (it may motivate exactly what the designer wanted, but re-counting your points is tedious) may be real flaw, though.

RATING: 6.6
Rated from a first impression.  I'd like to play this a few more times to form a better opinion about it.  The actions and play were interesting for how light and fast the game is.  The scoring isn't difficult but is more complicated than some might like for a 15 minute game.

[i]Obviously this is based on one play, but I was completely underwhelmed by the very basic game play. You can take 3 actions on your turn from a list such as draw cards, place tokens, flip tokens, play a card from your hand. Yes you could set up some very basic combos, but I never felt like I was accomplishing anything. 

Why, because it is very easy to have everything you do on a turn become completely undone by another player without any way to protect yourself. The the random nature of the card play basically kills the opportunity to set up actions you can execute on your next turn which means each turn is self contained and to be honest quite boring.

The scoring is fine if a bit formulaic (it feels like an inelegant Knizia scoring system that really just rewards you for treating each scoring currency with equal value). The end game trigger is extremely problematic because after it is triggered everyone gets one more turn (besides the person triggering it) making it a disadvantage to the player ending the game because they are out of actions and at the mercy of the other players. At that point the game could come to a stand still as people math out where everyone stands and then decide what the best play is for them. Not exciting to say the least, especially since some players will be so far out of it the only decision they will have is who to king make. This game feels like it needed more play testing and some streamlining of the game play. There isn't anything in this game that makes me want to play again.[/i]

RATING: 9.02
There is something I love about this game, even though each time I've played it no one has necessarily enjoyed it.  The art is obviously spectacular, but beyond that the mechanics feel so minimal yet maximal.  The board is so tight and simple it becomes brutal in a way.  And the cards let you do strong, creative things without being overpowered.

The issues I've had is downtime.  Each card has so much potential that everyone takes forever just reading them, trying to keep in mind all the possible things they can do.  The three actions for some reason take an unreasonable amount of time, and it suffers from the "nothing to think about when it is not my turn" phenomenon.  

That aside though, I love the vibe and experience of playing.  I think if I got a group together who was willing to invest enough time that they knew what all the cards did it and thereby avoid the downtime it would be an amazing game.  Maybe someday.

While there are definitely some rough edges, the charm of this game more than makes up for them. It comes with its own mini art book! 

The art is terrific and works very well in the context of the game. A lot of love clearly went into this game. There's even inexplicably an extra game board with a unique pattern included even though the rules don't mention it. Karmaka is the closest comparison for this that I have, and we loved that game as well. Both games present you with slightly too many things to do and not enough actions to do them, and both games have you constantly messing with your opponent. Soulfall has the extra piece of the spatial board to contend with. My favorite part of the game might actually be the scoring. You could definitely figure out who's winning before the end, but the math equation to determine it is really fun when everything is finally done. The scoring really rewards playing intelligently.

My biggest request would be for some kind of symbology for the actions - by midway through the game it  becomes easy to miss one of the benefits of the lords you're devoted to as well as remembering exactly which action you took (since there are several different actions that can result in the same basic outcome).  The six god cards don't need to integrate with the deck so maybe I'll redesign my own. Other minor things... It needs gems instead of gem tokens (easily remedied) and whoever designed the box is forbidden from ever making another game box.

Overall though we were left with an overwhelmingly positive impression.

RATING: 6
Some interesting dynamics with the multi-use card play and caring what's on the top of the discard pile, but this definitely feels like a Kickstarter that didn't get enough game development.  On just a component side, the action cards are a poor decision - it would have been much better to make player aids with the text on the action cards plus the 6 lords' abilities, and then instead have 3 action token - one for "Using a Card's Action", one for "Devotion", and one for "Standard Action", all with a backside for "Standard Action."  Even better if every player had their own set of 3 tokens. That would keep the bookkeeping of your 3 actions much clearer to all players and make gameplay faster.  On the gameplay side, having scores open and easily calculated along with many ways to steal points from other players makes the endgame very boring - you either know exactly what you need to do to take the lead, or know you can't win and need to decide who to kingmake.  The game really needs hidden goals for bonus endgame points, like 6 points if you have the least shards, or 5 points if you have exactly X and Y lords.

Great little card game (inside a horrible looking box). My favorite of the three Clowdus games that I own (Omen, Hemloch & Soulfall). When playing with more than two players the losing player(s) can easily be forced into the role of King Maker(s). As such I think Soulfall is best as a two player game.

RATING: 7.8
Great little vicious game. Don't play with people who are thin-skinned since the game essentially forces back-stabbing. My only complaint is a few of the cards would cause infinite looping without some house rules thrown in (for example, one card allows a player to choose a discarded card and play it; the problem is that if there are two of these cards in the discard pile one can do this ad infinitum if only the rules are followed, which might cause issues with rule Nazis.) The end game can cause AP for folks who overthink.

2015: 7. Giving it a 7 to start with, may improve to 8 later, but right now the end game is sooooooo draggy, and too much of the conflict is back-and-forth, tit for tat, with no one really pulling far ahead without someone else sweeping them back.  Amazing art, glad I backed it and have a copy, but right now...yea, I dunno...

2017: 6. Amazing art, but that end game needs fixing, or the scoring in general. Will play again but have far better options in my collection.

Unique card and chit based area control boardgame.  Components are a mixed bag: the card art is gorgeous (and the main attraction for the game).  The board art is murky and the boards themselves will warp like crazy and take forever to flatten back down.  The cardboard chits are functional but a bit murky and the actual cardboard is light and crappy.

All that said, the actual gameplay is a neat tug of war that never feels like a slog.  Scoring will take a little bit to wrap your head around, but it's unique.  Solid.

I hate say say negative things about anything from Small Box Games because John Clowdus seems like such a nice guy -- but, like so many of his others, Soulfall feels like it's made up of interesting ideas that have not had sufficient development. I prefer interesting failures to tedious polish but this one is just frustrating.

Players use three actions per turn, with no more than one of each type of action, to both expand their board presence and acquire shard tokens; their final score is based on multiplying the number of nomads by the number of shards (there's a bit more to it). Giving up a card to "devote" themselves to its lord provides a permanent passive bonus until another player takes the bonus away, and playing a card allows duplicates of the other basic actions. Most cards also give bonus abilities if the player is devoted to the relevant lord or if the top card of the discard pile (the "current lord") matches it.

It all sort of works but there are a lot of small pain points. The player to trigger the end-game gets five points, but all other players get an extra turn; the multiplicative nature of the scoring makes some actions so wildly swingy that this is a very poor trade. The devotion cards for Ginjinx and Tikoop are particularly problematic: a final turn by a player with Tikoop is unlikely to be worth less than 15 points of swing. In a two player game it seems very difficult to acquire a sufficient lead as the other player has no-one else to target.

Perhaps most irritating is the system of bonuses for cards matching the current lord. These bonuses are very powerful but are awarded almost entirely at random. The obvious strategy of building a large hand to better exploit synergies in future turns doesn't work because of the Zsrizer card that forces other players to discard and draw back to two cards.

The artwork by Sandro Rybak is wonderful.

Seems a fun little area majority game with special VP calculation (areas*side action). Artwork is great. Gameplay I'm not sold on, though it seems to be solid.

Try before you buy, however as Small Box is situated in US this will be too costly to do. KS lists on $35 which is too expensive for what you get. Unless you love the art, that is.

For people collecting boardgames it is a no-brainer. Small Box games, small printruns and much sought after. EU price is bound to go up. 

Will not be adding this to my collection as I have too many unplayed games already, with this being another one eventually to be traded/sold for a small profit. However, I'm in the game-playing, not trading business.

Sheesh, that endgame is a major let down, overshadowing everything that came before it. Once someone takes the tower, the game then becomes a series of tedious calculations to work out how to take enough points off of the players before you to edge to victory. Consequently, going last seems to be massively powerful (I went from last to first on that turn).

An otherwise promising idea - I like the card play - though devotion to a number of the gods seems pretty uninspiring and hard to rely on for scoring, the whole scoring seems underdeveloped and the nomads and outposts lack sufficient differentiation, especially in yellow.

Visually stunning on a barren landscape of Druid migration, Soulfall is a game about area and resource control.  There is a nice mix of build and grief in the action choices.  The end of game scoring requires a bit of math comprehension to play optimally.  The artistic direction is stark and breathtaking.  

One issue with packaging: The game boards should have been configured smaller, more modular, and aligning together as needed.  This would have allowed for a more card friendly game box like Small Box's recent Omen Omega Edition.

Otherwise great so far.

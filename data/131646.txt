Roll and move, and a bastard to set up each time, but wonderfully fun. The existence of this game always makes me think I like pick up and deliver more than I do in most every other iteration - usually my problem is I'm not playing this.

This is an interesting game, but I can see how it might overstay its welcome. However, that is easily controlled by establishing net worth limits at the start. 

This is also a lengthy setup/teardown game, even when all of the cultures are organized. Still, it's an enjoyable game, and while it's not very deep, I would recommend it and play it if asked.

Have played this game three times now.  I love it.  Have had fun all three times.  Played the Classic version once and the new Standard version twice.  I've won both times on the Standard version, and was very much still in the running in the Classic game.  I want to get more plays in of the Classic game and more plays with a full complement of people on the Standard game, since I've only played that version with two players.  Favorite part, being galactic taxi driver. :)

Have only played standard - like the game, but it's WAY too long.  Seems like they "FFG'ed" the game a bit too much.  Want to try classic.

First game with 2P took almost 4Hrs.  "Fast" game with 2P took 2Hrs.

RATING: 6
The play I've had is the FFG version of the game - which I enjoyed once and dreaded twice. Here's the main problem: the wheels come off the game. It feels like FFG didn't bother to think about the insane combination of abilities to be gained by players late in play: like being able to skip literally every color on the game board or gaining money without even moving. Insane really. I *might* try this one more time with the original rules which probably works much better.

Clasicazo de Avalon Hill de los 80' reeditado con 2 versiones, la clásica es un sencillo tira dados - muevo la nave - compro o vendo mercancías, gracioso pero muy muy light. La otra version standard tengo que probarla, pero es un juego que parece mucho más desde fuera y que ha envejecido muy mal.

RATING: 4
The game looks impressive, but unfortunately the spell does not last longer than for the first few rounds.

More precisely, the initial rush to explore planets and to upgrade your ship is super fun. However, too soon you find yourself in a situation where the galaxy is wholly explored and the game turns into a boring roll and move tedium. You are just hoping to roll the right numbers so that you would be able to travel to the other side of the galaxy. The game lasts for 30 rounds with the play time scaling linearly with the number of players. And the worst thing is that you spend most of that time without anything interesting to do.

RATING: 6
The action of each turn is fairly interesting, but having the game go for 30 rounds makes it very long and sometimes dragging while you wait for slower players.

Love the theme, the exploration, ship upgrades, trading, spaceports, factories and the demand and market token mechanism.
Don't like the downtime that is possible with very new players, but it's not too bad. We took 90-120mins for recent 3P games.
It would be very good for teaching trading concepts, arithmetic, probabilities and percentages.

I like the feel of the game (only played FFG re-print rules thus far). It's fun to cruise through space and maximize your pick up and deliver plan across the star systems. The only real weakness is how long the game can last with only moderately in depth decisions to make every turn. But it's good when it's the type of thing I want to play

RATING: 7
Solid space trading game. Lots of stuff in the box. I prefer the standard rules. The classic rules in this box are missing the original Rastur rules from the AH edition.

I found it to be more entertaining to play against my own highscore than playing with the challenge cards. These cards are extremely hard to beat and sometimes the game ends after just a few turns. I managed to beat the challenges once, but that only works with pure luck and is a stressful experience. Furthermore the challenge cards take you away from the original motive of the game: space trading.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable space adventure. Players try to collect as much money as possible by doing various things like trading goods, transport people and completing missions. Players can upgrade there spaceship and their pilot. There are a lot of random events. Deep space can be dangerous sometimes so you better be prepared. Components are great with superb artwork as expected from FFG. The only negative is that the game lasts for around 1 hour per playe. Thats too much for a game of this weight.It is also very fiddly with many many tokens.

RATING: 6.5
With slightly too much of randomness like drawing missions that are immediately ended or dice-dependance [says the person which had twice during a game beautiful throw of 1+1+1(+2), and for whole game usually couldn't move further than 12], but still interesting. Rulebook is a bit chaotic. 30 rounds seems scary, but the further the game is, the longer you want to play - and it feels slowly near the start. Some day I'll pla again, but we need whole day for that - it took around 4,5h for 3p... (5h with explaining rules)

With high expectations after hearing all the good things about Merchant of Venus, I must admit that I was a little disappointed. The game is not bad, a classic pick-up and deliver, but it does not do much more than that. Firefly is its younger but more developed brother. Still... a good game.

Merchant of Venus uses several different elements that come together to form an epic space adventure game. Players take on the roles of space traders who move their ships through interconnected systems discovering new alien worlds to trade with and many different obstacles along the way. As players start to make money delivering commodities in a unique supply-and-demand system, their earnings can be used to purchase better ships and equipment (shields, lasers, engines, etc...) and construct their own spaceports (which speed up trading) and factories (which create better commodities). Variations (standard, classic and single player rules) included in the rulebook allow for considerable replay ability. The player with the most fame and fortune at the end of the game takes the day.

Tentative rating after one play (of original version).  I don't feel that the game is as dated as many posts have indicated.  Nice pick up and delivery mechanism, with a good replenishment mechanism.  However there is a lot of writing on the chits which is hard on aging eyes.  Fun, but randomness and luck play a big part in this game.  Looking forward to a replay.  Rating will probably go up.

Clippers seem to be a favorite around here, and you need to start making runs/earning money quickly, because once you're behind...

First Impression: Wonderfully produced FFG components, the game is basically a roll-and-move route building game. There are lots of luck-driven mechamisms to the game. It's a pleasant game to play with more tactical as opposed to strategic decisions.

Very surprised by this one.
Merchant of Venus is a VERY good game, the rules are very intuitive and excellently written, answers to everything that arises...is in the rule book, that has an excellent index at the back.
Components are great, although the standard game (ffg) implementation should of had card dashboards, and the credits (currency) should be bigger.

It's a mammoth game in physical size and hours put in, but you know what?, it's very much worth it, a brilliant time, very absorbing game play, very satisfying, it's rich in theme and there is plenty to do per go.
You got 30 rounds to basically do what you want in the Venus universe to maximise your credits.

Not tried ffg classic implementation on the reverse of the board yet, but looking forward to it.

This is a game I was looking for in our collection, one with great absorbing gameplay, that we can play and leave up overnight to complete next day, or for a rainy Sunday game.
We are even planning to do the "super session" , playing 60 rounds over two days.
So much in the box, classic game, new standard version and a viable solo version, plus numerous variants you can play straight out of the rule books.
Awesome game.

It's a keeper .

Edit:

Played all games at all player counts and upped rating to a 9 based on the Richard Hamblems "classic" game.

Played this second edition like the original and it worked pretty well.  I wasn't very excited about the fact that the factory goods are named the same as the regular goods and look very similar too.  The extra cloud on the left side of the board was a nice add.  Overall, it played enough like the original to keep me happy.  I don't know much about the "standard game" or whatever the new FF version is called.

Pick up and deliver......IN SPACE!  A genunely funny game about trying to make a buck as some sort of intergalatic merchant.  This reprint includes the classic rules and some spiced up FFG chromatic shit too.  Two great games for the price of one.  This has been largely overshadowed since Firefly hit stores...but you'd be a fool to not give this great game a chance.  What other game let's you sell "the finest dust" to humans so they can keep produce rock videos!  Not Firefly!  Go get this classic before FFG decides they'd be better suited to retheme it to Star Wars.

This is such a solid game. I really love so much about it. The exploration is great and the way the game evolves as you play through  it and your strategy has  to emerge and change depending upon the board state  and how it grows in opportunities as you build  your ship. But it is DAMN long -but I don't know if it could be shorter.

Now the standard game with the action, mission & reward-cards was played 2 times. The ideal audience of players is indeed 3 player. But i'am not sufficient with Std.Game. There is for my opinion, a greater missing of tough decisions. So i had to try the classic version and indeed i was surprised? This is my version of MoV! And as a variant designer i'am, i spend some thoughts over the best of two rulebooks. I liked the Rastur Worm pirate tiles and the idea of a small armed spacetransporter. So i downloaded Michael Christophers (Dathkadan) superb artwork of 4 old known and 4 new spacetransporters and did them P&P. This 4x 8 spaceships are so well drawn, that i only want to play with them. My variant of  the thougher cĺassic version, accept the 14 equipment tiles and the market exchange tiles from Std.game. The relicts and other encounter tokens function as usual at the classic MoV. So actual i write the variant rules for a perfect MoV-Symbiosis. Release January 2018.

Hubby bought this and then we demo'ed it at GenCon. There was an observer watching and continually told me I was playing my turn wrong and was giving unwanted advice through the whole demo.  It was very frustrating and left me with a bad opinion of the game. This was one of my first GenCons= there is no way I would have tolerated that now. Anyway, because of that experience, it has never hit our table.

Good, albeit long game, about discovery and interplanetary entrepreneurship.

Components are all high quality but as per the norm from FFG, the rulebook is obtuse and intimidating for how simple the game really is. I suppose there are a few fiddly rules, but for the most part it's a straightforward game about making tons and tons of cash.

I'm interested in checking out the solo variant.

I love this game!

Merchant of Venus hits on some pretty awesome cylinders for me. It has a variable setup which will affect what your strategy will be, enough luck to keep you on your toes, fun sci-fi humor that's not too corny, and beautiful art/components.

This has quickly become one of my favorite games and one of my wife's favorite games (even though it's well outside of her normal length sweet spot).

One of the big upsides of this game is that it is incredibly easy to teach for how complex it is. For the most part you can just play through some turns and explain all the rules as you go (as long as the people you play with aren't too crazy competitive!)

On my first play, I was frustrated by the heavy luck factor, but I suspected that some of my bad luck had been caused by bad decisions. On my second play, I realized that my previous opinion was wrong and that the game was broken and a waste of time. My opinion has softened a little since then, but not by much. The roll-and-move mechanic is so stupid, made even worse by the random and arbitrary navigation hubs. Every 10 minutes you can expect to basically lose a turn (or lose multiple turns as you are jettisoned to a remote corner of the board for no reason). This is the Zombies!!! of space games.

The most disappointing aspect of the game is that it is actually pretty fun for about 40 minutes, but then gets really tedious and repetitive once the board has been explored. It is also the fiddliest game I have ever played. Full disclosure: We've only played the "Classic" game. Maybe the FFG revised rules will change my mind. 

UPDATE: I have now tried both the Standard and Classic versions multiple times. I do not like this game. Sold.

Durante mucho tiempo me plantee si merecia la pena jugar a este clasico de AH y tras dos partidas me tengo que rendir a el.

Si es azaroso y al final todo se gana en 1 o 2 turnos pero el juego es muy divertido, ahora me parece un delito que el Xia sea como es existiendo este juego. Si esto lo hubiera tenido en mi adolescencia lo habria jugado hasta la nausea.

The "standard" game has the same problems as the classic AH version (skewed very heavily towards speed, merchant ports, and high-value goods) while ballooning the complexity with ship upgrades at every port, frequent event cards, pilot special abilities, pirates, etc. to no real purpose. Also, 30 turns makes for a longer game, especially with more players, when things are really going to be over much earlier. In classic MoV, you could only leverage so much cash because your ship was a comparatively narrow pipe (the dominant Clipper strategy relies on delivering only 2 goods at a time). Now that you can both have 4 holds *and* be fast, early leads solidify pretty rapidly, and you're playing 30 turns but realistically it's over after 20.

The "classic" game is also included, which is great, but the problem is the graphic design is horrible to the point of virtual unusability for anyone over 30. The crisp, clean Avalon Hill design was not particularly attractive, but at least it provided minimal friction to actually playing the game. The FFG board and goods chits are so busy and use fonts so small it looks like it was designed by an 8th grader.

RATING: 7
Played with the more classic rules, not the FFG treatment.

I'm a huge fan of pick-up and deliver, and this game does a really great job of it.  The neat twist here is the bit of exploration at the beginning, so you're discovering civilizations that produce different things while discovering where they can be delivered as well.

Players also get to build ports and such to make themselves more efficient while also making more money, and upgrades are also available to your ships to allow you to improve as the game goes on.

The only downside is that the glut of chits can make the board situation a bit tough to read and analyze quickly, but overall, just a solid pick-up and deliver game!

Fun game which provides an interesting, although lengthy, ride.  Many neat mechanics and unique attributes make this highly enjoyable. 

On the downside, it is a bit long and luck plays a large factor.  

NOTE - I have only played the Standard version which I hear is not as good as the Classic version.  Looking forward to trying the Classic version out.

[Standard Version]I'm torn. In some ways I really like the game. A fun goofy theme with just enough strategy to keep it interesting. The problem for me is that it falls into a downtime funk: it's not interactive or meaty enough to justify the time in between turns. It reminds me of the crayon rail games in that way. If I could keep the game under three hours with 4 I'd probably really enjoy it. I will revisit after, hopefully, a shorter play. 

UPDATING: So here's the problem. MoV is kind of fun, but finally too random to justify the investment. Turns are your most valuable resource in these sorts of logistics games, and luck of the draw/roll can set you back beyond the capacity to make up for it. Chasing First Contacts in what later turns out to be the opposite side of the board from your homeworld will absolutely wreck your game. Plus it throws in handful of nasty pick-on-the-percieved-leader mechanisms that are more frustrating than fun. If there were more turns, it might be possible to catch up after getting hosed by randomness, but good God, I can't imagine playing this game for 5 or more hours. Swingy chaos need not necessarily be unfun, but if the system is going to take me along for a ride, I need to be immersed in theme and narrative. MoV fails at theme and narrative generation for me.

In the end it just feels like a fairly dry logistics game with a warmed over theme and the usual FFG overproduction. In other words, this sort of gaming is not for me. 

The Good: The map is cool and I love the use of the roll-and-move mechanic (although the dice can really end up fucking you over pretty badly). It's fun to plan your navigation through the gates and lost-in-space points. 

FINAL UPDATE (Maybe): logistics games like this just feel sort of repetitive and dry. MoV is not immersive enough to scratch my story-and-theme itch and has too little control for a real strategy game. That isn't to say that it's devoid of meaningful decision. It certainly isn't, it's just that your decisions will probably be outweighed by swingy B.S., which I'm fine with in other sorts of games, but not here. Still, I'd play again, but probably with only two, or at most three, players to keep the downtime manageable.

Aesthetically, this game has the usual FFG issues: overproduced, garish, and an overwritten, yet still incomplete-feeling and difficult to navigate, rulebook. I will almost never buy a FF game unless it's been thoroughly vetted outside of BGG fandom by me or someone whose opinion I really trust. The last several FFG games I've played have just felt half finished and amateurish.

Just took the Merchant of Venus (FFG-standard and Fast variant) on Aug 9, 2013.  The game took more than 2 hours even for using the fast variant.  Not quite excited with its mechanism and theme carrying.  The game is not deep enough for gamer.  I don't believe a serious gamer or war game lover likes playing this game. 

The game is something like an epic "康樂棋" with trading mechanism.  Spending an hour per player on the table may not be a good choice.  This game embedded an epic artwork and has huge amount of tokens but with simple dice rolling navigation strategy with sudden events.  It is not a bad game but also not a great and master piece game.  However, the game may be very good and suitable for solitaire!

A fun pick-up-and-deliver game. You can tell it was written in the '70's, but to me that's part of the charm of the game. Now having played both the Standard and Classic versions, I can say bot hare fun. However, the Classic version is definitely superior. Some of the changes made in the Standard game are simply clunky, add complexity & fiddliness to no gain, and slow play. Standard games have taken 3-4 hours, the Classic play took 2.5 with some delays--so 2 hours or under is easily attainable.

A game I bought early in my entry into the hobby. At that time I had nobody to play games with and I had got MoV to play the FF solo game that is in the standard version of the reprint. I didn't like it. The goals in the solo game seemed meaningless and arbitrary.

MoV sat on my shelf on shelf unplayed for 3 years. Every once in awhile I'd pull it down and read the rulebooks but even after some friends and I got a game group going I still didn't bring it out, intimidated by the longgg playtime.

Tonight I finally brought it out and played the 'classic' version and man it was great. A tight design despite it's age with just enough going on. A great deal of luck in the roll-and-move but it plays more like push-your-luck. Having to pick your heading before rolling made for some fun choices. 'Should I take the long route or risk those navigation spaces??' 
I doubt I'll ever bother with the 'standard' version again. In his review Eric Summerer made a comment about extra complexity layered on top of the design in the standard edition and that is also the impression I got from the rulebook. It's entirely possible that this is incorrect but I really don't think the original design needed to be 'improved'.

update: But ultimately this game does have some length issues. One of the main accomplishments of modern design if the amount of fun and story that can be fit into a relatively short play time. I like this game, I'll never get rid of it, but nobody in my group is going to commit the time it requires. When my boy gets bigger I'll make him play it with me:)

update: Played it with the boy and had a blast. We played 'classic' and left it set up in the basement. It should be treated like watching 2001 or the LotR movies: not appropriate for one sitting but broken up over multiple it's marvelous. Not a game to play with my friends but with the kiddo is great fun.

After a few plays at the Classic Game, it seems really good. I especially like the combination of luck and skill: it's not an headache to play, yet it's not silly at all. Several strategies and choices are open to the players. And, last but not least, every game begins different. So replay-ability is nearly infinite.

Good god what a horrible and epic mess of 5 hours this game is. Thankfully we all mutually agreed to end the game at 15 rounds after playing our 4th turn.

This game is a reprint of the same original game of Merchant of Venus. The creaking old age of this game shows in its old style "roll and move" mechanics and brain dead random game mechanisms everywhere else in the game. Its an old dying dog spray painted pink and trotted out to make its license holders some money.

People buy this game for the pretty pink spray paint and nostalgia value.

So many better games with better game mechanics that could be played in the 5+ hours that you will waste your time on this. STAY AWAY, you were warned!

i was not familiar with the original when i first played 2nd edition. now having played both i enjoy the standard game a bit more although the classic game has a few advantages.

the new techs introduce in the new game are really fun and I found the market shifts a reasonable replacement for demand tokens. the main downside the new game has vs. the old is that it's very long and there's not real good way to shorten it. playing to either 2K or 3K with the original game works better in my experience than reducing turns in the new release.

the main complaints you'll see here and they certainly have merit are that:

1. roll and move is by its nature super random which can be rough in a 4 hour game.
2. it's a 4 hour game

The original rules are excellent; I love the pacing, I love the theme and I love the dynamics - especially how Demands works out. And while the mechanics for demands is something that I'm also quite fond of with the new "Standard" rules, I don't enjoy playing with them as much as I do with the classic game :/ I just feel that FFG tried too hard and threw in too much stuff and too many components - less is more if you know what I'm saying, and while they HAVE presented a lot of good ideas, they simply don't come nicely together but instead makes for a very long and tedious game.

Merchant of Venus is a great game. It often hits the table during our weekly gaming sessions. 
The artwork on the board and the high number of quality tokens and markers make the game memorable. The spaceship miniatures are really nice and the dashboards give well the feeling of piloting a space vessel. The kind humour of the game makes me laugh all the time. 
Overall, the game is beautiful from all aspects, and at the same time it really expects planning and clever decision-making. There are many paths to choose from: you can buy or sell goods, upgrade your ship, level up your pilot or help passengers to reach their desired destination. All your deeds will grant you fame or increase your infamy, and all of these mostly depends on you. 

I haven't tested the game with Classic Rules yet, but concerning the Standard Rules, the game is challenging, entertaining and intelligent. It really can steal your free time and teleport you into a post-war sector of the galaxy where the rebuilding of commerce is up to you!

10 points


Update on 25 November, 2013.
I own the game since almost a year now. It's fantastic and attracts us all the time. We regularly play it, and I must admit it does worth the time and effort of preparing all the counters and markers on the table. I could seem to be tiring to someone, but this shouldn't hinder you in playing the game.
Of course I don't change my rating. :D

I've only had one 2-player (standard) game so far to get a feel for it. The 2-player experience certainly didn't wow me. I think it just took too long for the map to reveal itself so you could start making meaningful decisions in buying and selling. I'll try it with 3 or 4 players some day although I'm not sure the game length is really in my Goldilocks-zone. Based on one play.

Pick-up and deliver game with one of my favorite themes. This is the boardgame version of computer games like "Elite" or "Privateer": exploring the [u]space[/u], trading, transporting passengers, improving the ship, fighting pirates etc.
Two different versions can be played: Standard & Classic. The Standard version is more thematic and fiddle, with lots of dice rolling, card flipping, missions, pirates and random things. The Classic version has no time limits, is less thematic and less random and allows more tactics and strategies. Both are awesome and very enjoyable.
Works with any number of players, including [color=red]solitaire[/color].

Wished FFG hadn't gotten the rights to reprint this, expect board typos, rule book being ambiguous and an FAQ 6 months later. Can you say Elder Sign? Ah, but the FFG can do no wrong Fanboys will buy it. I will wait for the second printing of the second edition, I learned my lesson from past purchases of FFG phone it in products, would not get a D minus as a High School project effort. Was so looking to the reprint, not so anymore. I am not interested in supporting FFG's "ups and downs", like dealing with a professional drunk relative. FFG is at the bottom of my publishers list. There is no excuse for their poor proof reading and lack it would seem of one last test play with a fresh group before the printers start. The card typos in Edler Sign, a very simpe game, is inexcusable and is the their hallmark.

Yay! Traded this peice of shit for Gates of Loyang-so probably lost $10 or $15 but this game was SUPER clunky-to travel anywhere you had to go across innummerable blue, red, yellow dots and any of the red/yellow required you to throw a dice and then you might have to stop right there or maybe you went on-but did you throw a 6 and the red dot was #3? Or??? Just getting from place to place bad enough, then at its heart you just get stuff from one place and TRY to sell it to another-if you can get there before the game ends....not much fun WHERE IS THE GOOD SPACE GAME IN ALL THIS????????

Pick-up-and-deliver space themed game.  You play as a space merchant buying and selling weird and wonderful goods from one planet to another.  

I find it quite relaxing to play, so in that regard I really enjoy it.  I really do feel like I'm a space trading merchant exploring the galaxy and steering my spaceship through hazards in space!  

Players have their own mini-missions to accomplish as well as trying to buy and sell goods to make the most cash.  

The Fantasy Flight components are well made.  There's about 3 million chits so some clever storage is recommended to speed up the game set-up and take-down.

RATING: 6
Components: Gorgeous board. Good quality cards and tokens. Clear iconography. Cool plastic ships. Outstanding production quality.

Experience: Standard version: Too long and complicated for what it delivers. The thematic complexity of pilots, ships, ship upgrades, missions, encounters, rewards, fame, spaceports, mining, and fluctuating markets all obscure and protract the core pick-up and deliver mechanism. It took us three hours to play 20 rounds of a two-player game. If that same amount of fun had been compressed into 45 minutes, it would have been worth it; but spread out over 3 hours meant long, tedious turns. I can see someone would be attracted to this game if they're looking for a long, immersive economic game. I come to it hoping it's a medium-length (~90 minutes) immersive pick-up and deliver game, more thematic and involved than Logistico, but not to such a degree.

Having now read the rules to the classic version, I think even that would be too complicated and long. Planning a much simpler version of the classic game, and will try playing to just 1000 credits.

Only played this once, so consider this my first impressions. Setup was a chore! I think it took close to 30 minutes to setup, maybe longer, and even longer to figure out the rules (and I was playing with someone who had played it before). I found it an enjoyable and rewarding experience, but it took a very, very long time to play. Although I like the randomized locations of the planets in theory, it made planning what course to take rather more difficult in practice than it should have been (compared to Firefly: The Game).

I've only played the classic game.  A great pick up and deliver game that I've been playing at least once a year since the original came out. The board is always different, which means you need to explore to find good trade routes, and then modify your ship to work with the routes you find. I'd love to see a version of this using a historical exploration theme (which was the original design idea anyway). The new edition is certainly prettier than the original. Too bad FFG felt the need to 'update' a classic design with new rules...I've never actually used those since the original ones are so good (and included in the box!).

Monopoly in Space? What gets me to play this game is the space theme on top of an interesting pick-up-and-deliver with a slight exploration aspect. The roll-and-move is not so bad in this game when looked at from a space-faring-trading-is-not-an-exact-science perspective.

The setup is long and the gameplay isn't very deep but there are two rulesets to play with.

One play in, seems decent if a bit chaotic. Unlike what I've heard about the original version, this one dispenses with the different ship types and simply lets you upgrade a generic ship as you see fit. You can also upgrade your pilot, and purchase technology.

All of this upgrading and purchasing mitigates the chaos to some degree, though there's still the luck of the event deck and the placement of the trade goods. Despite the chaos, I definitely think there's some strategy involved.

Anyway, on the whole it's good but not great. I doubt I'll ever pick this up, but I'd be happy to play someone else's copy.

[i]Comment for the Classic Edition.[/i]

Normally I don't rate games after just two plays (of which one was incomplete), but since I fear that I won't get a chance to play the game again in the near future, I went ahead and gave it an 8. While I do enjoy Merchant of Venus (MoV) immensely, my gaming group seems to have dismissed it as a mostly luck driven game. I won't argue that everything else equal, some bad rolls may decide the winner. But I see the game more as a game of risk management. Based on the current state of the board you value your options and decide which route to take. If you don't want to mess with the navigation spaces and risk a turn or so, go ahead and find a more secure alternative.

Here are some thoughts about Merchant of Venus:

* I do like the story arch that unfolds when playing MoV. While you focus on exploration to identify the best trade routes in the first turns of MoV, the game changes to a more efficiency focused exercise in the later stages which can easily end in a race for the win in the last few turns. Great!

* I like the way demand and the availability of goods are handled in this game. Since the number of available goods normally decreases over the course of the game and the demand rises, the value of trade routes changes over time. The trade route that was great in midgame might become suboptimal in a later stage of the game. It's up to you to deal with this ever changing conditions in the best way possible.

* There seem to be some quite some viable strategies to apply based on the current board state. Do I use a heavy freighter to earn my cash on a short trade route or do I prefer a faster spaceship? Can I afford a spaceport now so that I can save a turn later or won't I be able to deliver to it again? Can I afford to lose a cargo hold to buy a drive to gain some speed? Decisions, decisions, decisions.

* Downtime can be a problem. MoV isn't a short game and it could be that you're waiting for some player to finish their turn most of the time. A reason for this is that there's quite some math in the game in that you have figure out how much money you need this and the following turns to achieve what you want. Together with the ever changing market and the not so easy to decipher board, there's some potential for AP to arise.

* Setting up the game can be a bit of a chore because of all the tiles.

To sum it up: I do really like pick-up and deliver games and MoV with it's ever changing trade routes is a great one in my opinion. It's not a short game but I had a lot of fun every time I had the fortune to play it.

This feels like an old school American game (which it is).  There is a lot of down-time, a lot of looking through counters to find the right one, a lot of fiddly, a lot of cross-referencing charts and cards and backs of counters, and a general lack of polish that you don't expect to find in modern games.

I know some people enjoy Merchants of Venus, but it's not my type of game.  I think the people who enjoy it create a story in their mind when they play it.  Although I love role playing games, this one doesn't feel anything like that to me.  It is just tedious and boring, though with a glimmer of a game that could be developed if someone put a lot of time and energy into it.

I played a 3 player game.  Their was one time when I had a full ship, no money, and all I had to do was go somewhere to deliver some goods.  I needed to roll an 11 with three six-sided dice to get there, so I knew it might take 2 turns.  I rolled a 5.  That was the end of my turn.  Then I rolled a 5 again on my next turn.  That was the end of my next turn.  Meanwhile, the next played was taking a long time to think through their moves, and the other player was looking through counters and organizing chits.  So I had nothing to do, and no one to talk to.  Simply put, I was bored and hoping the game would end as soon as possible.

Travel between the stars, buying and selling goods and ferrying passengers between different civilizations.  As you earn more credits, you can purchase various upgrades for your ship and level up your pilot.  Pirates, wormholes, and various other hazards remain a constant threat, so you will need to upgrade your lasers and shields to make traveling the galaxy a safer experience.

Fantasy Flight has set a fine example of how to do a reissue of a classic game.  They give you not only a reprint of the original, but also an updated version of the game.  The games are different enough that it is getting two games for the price of one.

The Classic version is a freewheeling family game.

The Standard version is much more challenging, longer game.  

I think is important to realize that the two games are very different experiences meant for different kinds of game groups and are not just variants of each other.  It is great that FFG game us two games for the price of one!

8,0 : Classic Game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
STANDARD GAME (FFG):  Haven't played it, and likely won't.  Typical FFG bloat, requiring about 10,000 additional tokens and counters.

CLASSIC GAME (FFG):  A pretty light pick-up-and-deliver affair with a cool space theme.   The exploration element is one of the primary charms.   The basic strategy boils down to finding the fastest and most lucrative delivery routes and then exploiting them.   However, the demand tokens may (and likely will) throw a wrench in your plans, as suddenly more profitable shipments will emerge elsewhere on the map.   So, there is a fair amount of luck -- both in movement rolls, and what tokens come out of the bag.   I'm not bothered by that, but I can see where some people might be.  The game seems to move slow at first, but rapidly accelerates towards the end as people start making $400-$600 deliveries.

I have one major complaint about the FFG version.  It is visually exhausting.  Busy, busy, busy.   The factory goods are nearly indistinguishable from the standard goods.   Destination numbers are cluttered by pointless icons.  Good names are very, very small.    Maybe I'm just getting old, but this game made my eyes weary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even though I've only played the game a handful of times (it's certainly quite hard to get a game going), I always enjoy the overall story that a round of Merchant of Venus tells. It starts with a foray into the unknown, discovering the various races of the universe. But soon, as more knowledge about the board is revealed, the game turns into a race of efficiency: should I improve my ship? What's the best distance/profit trade-off?  So many decisions, and a long game in which to make many of them.

It turned out the price for the game match the components you get in the box. Tonnes and tonnes of cardboard pieces.

I am less interested in this each time I play it. I still respect the design but i think i ultimately find the efficiency savings of pick up and deliver a bit boring. I had a cycle courier job for a short period and that was actually more interesting than these sorts of games. Who'd of thought that real life work could be better than the game.

-------------

I much prefer the old Hamblin rules. It seems a more focused game, with less ffg junk over the top. It doesn't induce as much analysis paralysis and it has simpler cleaner mechanics. Also the when you hit a situation in which you need a shield you loose money rather than end your turn. I really dislike games that stop you from playing them and would much prefer to sacrifice some points.

Based on the Hamblin rules this gets a 7, thanks Stronghold games.

--------------------

Only played FFG new rules and i wasn't that impressed. You can't do that much on your turn, typically either move, or buy and sell. But even with 4 players, you only need one with a few dice determined upgrades for it to really slow down. Lots of waiting to carryout an action you'd determined 15minutes ago in 3 seconds then pass the turn on. Further more there are lots of mechanics to end your turn even earlier, so that you do even less. The map and all the chits promise a world of opportunity, but the game tries to stop you from doing anything interesting in it.

I'm torn between leaving this rating as it is or lowering it.  The game is not at all bad.  In fact, it's pretty good.  I just have no desire to play it.  Although I never got a chance to play the classic game, which by popular vote is better than the updated FFG version, in the end I felt no reason to bother with learning it.

I am more than happy to play it again, so I suppose on that front, the rating is fine.  I just got rid of my copy because I couldn't see myself getting people together to play it; there's just so much more that I would rather play than this one.

2015-07-28 : I’ve known about this game basically from the year it got published by AH back in the late eighties, and it immediately attracted my attention, yet it would take nearly 30 years before I actually got to play it. Compared to its contemporaries it has aged really well in the sense that if you said it was designed just last year, people would believe it.

With the dice and the variable distribution of races over the planets its of course a hugely random game, but I knew that going in and just treated it as an experience – finally being able to play the game I drooled over in the AH printed catalogue so many years before. 

As I had some luck with the dice and the races my experience was fun, but I can (and did) see that continued unlucky rolls and getting stuck on routes can be hugely frustrating. As this is not a short game, getting behind and not being able to catch-up is not fun.

I would play it again, but only with people who knew what they were getting into and treat it as an experience and not as a competitive game. 

The nice graphics and layout earn it extra points

5/2013 ... rating after one play of Standard Game.

Very enjoyable and thematically rich.  Multiple options for a roll and move.  I'll be interested in the replayability of the game.  Moving the races around will contribute to replayability but I wonder how long it will take to discover the boundaries of the MoV universe.  I'm not a dice hater but I'm always a little nervous that there won't be enough options to mitigate risk and the dice will take over.  A bit of a learning curve and a fairly long game.  2-player took just over 4 hours ... not including learning the game.  This could easily be cut as players become more familiar with the game.

Sept 2013 ... okay, this if fairly arbitrary but I'm cutting the rating from 8.7 to 7.7 because the classic game is so horrible.  Wow.  It's probably not fair to cut this an entire point because of one (extremely late night) play of the classic game, but ... wow ... Classic is bad.

7/16 ... Good grief what was I thinking?  This game is horrible.  It's like waiting 4 hours to die.  Dropped it to 3.7.  On the Boardgame Geek 1-10 scale it should probably be lower.

Merchant of Venus is a terrific game. As others have said, the Fantasy Flight board design is too busy, which makes it hard to eyeball the length of trade routes.

This game needs to be played correctly!
1. Should only play classic version until you really feel comfortavle with the game, because there is so many things to handle even ind the classic version, that it's very easy to get lost....

2. Works well with 2 players, best with 3. DO NOT PLAY WITH 4!!!

3. First game's goal should be 1000-1500 credits.

This is really a good game! 
I guess it's the only old school game that my group is willing to play.

Roll&Move mechanic is terrible, but works just fine in this game.

A normal 3 player game lasts 2.5 hours, which feel a little bit too much.

Deserves more than a 7, but less than an 8. I think it's closer to an 8 (classic version only)

A classic válzozatot próbáltuk ki. Hangulatos űrbeli mászkálás. Új fajokat fedezel fel, árukat veszel és adsz el jobb áron a világ másik végén, nomeg utasokat fuvarozol. Mindezt 2000 pénz eléréséig. Nekünk annyira nem is ment túl a játékidő, 2 óra alatt lezavartuk az első meccset. A játékmenet a 24 oldalas szabály ellenére aránylag egyszerű, és elég elemiek a körök ahhoz, hogy ne legyen túlzottan holtidő. Mély döntésekre azért nem kell számítani, de a jó hangulat adott. Talán az lehet benne a legügyesebb, aki hamar átlátja, hogy milyen útvonalakon lehet egy rentábilis kört csinálni a cuccokkal, úgy hogy mindenhol tudjál eladni és venni is valamit, és mindezt hozzá igazítja a folyamatosan változó kereslethez.

Annak ellenére, hogy szánalmasra sikerült az első játékom, szívesen ülnék még le vele játszani. Nomeg hátra van még a standard változat kipróbálása is.

the Classic game is super.  Did not enjoy the pirate version - found it too bitty, and I hate having my goods stolen.  the dice in that version made the game too volatile.
the Classic game, however, leaves the players to strategise - the whole experience is more enjoyable and much better fun.

RATING: 7
(Note: I've only played the Classic game so far, so my comments only refer to that version.)

MoV is an old-school pick-up-and-deliver system with quite a bit of complexity although the condensed underlying ruleset is fairly simple. Random factors play an important role, especially considering that it's a rather long game. On the other hand, this long playtime provides some opportunity for these chance results to even out a little.

Even though the mechanisms are ultimately very simple the game manages to evoke a surprising amount of narrative. There is some sense of exploration, racing for the best trade deals, and just straight out profiteering throughout. The galaxy awaits.

I'll have to say the usability design of the FFG edition is somewhat suboptimal, however.

This game is a great game, and a lot of fun. There's a bit of learning curve for the rules, but it's not too bad at all. Once you start playing it really becomes quite fun. I've mostly played solo games. You basically move around in space to be first contact on planets, deliver passenger, buy and sell goods, attempt to fill out your spaceship with cool upgrades. Gain fame and get rich in space. The solo challenge is pretty difficult to win, but not impossible. Solo feels... hard to describe... a bit lacking.

It's a long game when playing with a group. I tried it with 2 other players who were newbies at these types of games and it got a little late and we ended it after only 3 turns. It takes 30 turns to complete the game and there is a much longer variant where you can play 60 turns. 

I'm missing a blue ship with stand, if anyone has one they wanna give up.

(Classic game) The game begs for unique player/ship actions that provide more control over dice rolls. While on the first play, I thought the roll-and-move mechanic with the navigation die was quite interesting, on the second play I felt it was a major liability. Not being able to go where you want to go in a game that requires you to get somewhere to do anything at all (especially if you have no money) is simply not fun. There needs to be an alternative to simply dumping cargo or seeking out new planets for getting back to a playable amount of money if a delivery didn't work out.

Another lumbering, over-chromed FFG mutant monstrosity. And I mean that in a good way. The game tells a story and has plenty of theme. The problem is that it's a caramel apple with a razor blade inside. It has resource-management pick-up and deliver gameplay AND a capricious card-and-dice fate system that can kneecap your best laid plans after an hour of setup. It has rout planning and optimization AND a diabolical, dice-based movement system that can see your ship spinning about and heading for the back of beyond, or have the table rolling their eyes as you count, re-count, and count again trying to determine the best path to deliver your impossible furniture or whatever the hell. These are two great tastes that DON'T taste great together. Plus player interaction is minimal and the downtime can be considerable (which I don't mind, it gives me time to visit). Played both versions and I prefer the standard game, but neither is an especially clean design.

The FF version of the game is really bad. They add unnecessary heaviness to the game with components and things that does not contribute to the original designer's idea. It just increase the length of the game without improving it. Lots of useless things, lots of useless junk, cards and tiles.

The FF version is really not worth a penny. But their classic version is enjoyable even though they are not the ones who designed it.

I think they could have done a much better job at their version... they really blew it this time. It's a really bad game compared to the original one.

I only got it because it was 30$... I would never pay more than that for this game... and all of that 30$ I paid for the classic version, not the FF game which sucks royally.

EDIT: I then sold it it, good riddance.

Don't buy this at full price, get a deal pay no more than half the price max, since only half the game is worth anything (classic version).

I give the FF version a 2 out of 10, it is really crappy. I give the classic version a 6.5 and it is with the original game instead of here.

UPDATE: I have now played a second time, this time with 4 players using Classic rules. It was significantly more enjoyable than the first game (Standard Rules, 2 player), and I can't tell if it was because there were more players or because the Classic rules are just better.  I'm inclined to think the rules are more of an impact than the number of players.  There were a lot of things I really enjoyed more in Classic mode and a lot of things I really hated in "Standard" rules. 

One annoying thing is people seemed to stand around taking forever to take each turn; sure, it was new for all of us, but it shouldn't take so long after the first few rounds! Not sure why people took so long... there aren't THAT many decisions to ponder in a turn, and it's definitely a game where you should be plotting your next move while other people are taking their turns (since their decisions rarely affect you anyway)

I'll bump this one up to a 4 overall... 5 for Classic edition with 4 players (probably the best), 2 for Standard rules with 2 players (probably the worst.)  Still, I feel like I should create my own new game with these components, more of a "Galactic Privateer" game in which more strategy is involved (not so much dice rolling for movements), and maybe you could attack/steal from other players...


ORIGINAL POST: This is an interesting game. (Notice I said "interesting", not "fun"!) Played 2-player, Standard version (haven't tried Original or Classic.) I feel deceived by the high ratings on BGG -- perhaps those people are giving ratings out of nostalgia more than anything else.

Way too much luck involved, kills any "strategies" you might want to try. Takes half the game just to reveal cultures and get into full swing... then you don't have enough time to make any of your planned strategies work.

I really wanted to like this game. I spent $50 on it, and don't know if I will ever play again (but I will have to give Classic a try, and I feel it is probably better with 4 players.) Took me 3 turns to move 8 spaces, thanks to die rolls (you could move 4 spaces -- or you could move 18. Big difference here, and you really NEED big numbers because the routes are long and the board sprawling.)

Took us nearly an hour to set up, then 2-3 hours (about halfway through the game) just to reveal all cultures and start forming plans. By that time, there weren't enough turns left to enact those plans or strategies. Nobody could even get License to Drill tech until round 16 or 17.

Many encounter cards, abilities, and spaceports have pretty much zero effect on a 2-player game. Many upgrades/tech don't even give good return on investment, while others can be ridiculously lucky and imbalanced (Fuzzy Dice comes to mind.)  

Total game time: over 5 hours with 2 players. My wife was begging to just give up and end the game about halfway through (and she was the one who urged me to buy it in the first place, based on seeing the game board, premise, and sci-fi traveling merchant theme.) She has proposed we make an entirely new set of rules using the board and components to create a game that is actually fun.

The only reason I am not giving it a 1 is because the theme, art, and components are enjoyable, and because I have only played it once so I am holding out hope that it will be more fun with 4 players, or Classic mode (but Classic sounds even MORE luck-driven and less strategic), or maybe we just had bad luck (Examples: low speed rolls; Combo Drive located in asteroid system -- possibly the worst location to get to; License to Drill didn't appear until LAST culture/race was discovered; telegates appeared RIGHT NEXT TO existing telegates on the board -- this makes them a hindrance and strategically useless, and it happened TWICE; Pirates never appeared a single time in the game.)

Man, am I glad I have a copy of the original. I haven't tried the "classic" version (which is not identical to the original, and the changes seem for the worse), but the new "standard" version is a serious downgrade. Standard "draw a card and something crazy happens" nonsense. Techs are silly and unbalanced (the fuzzy dice are an obvious offender). It's also the case that 30 turns is an awkward time frame; it often results in too little being discovered. Played swiftly, the original was not overlong, so I don't see why they needed to fix this.
The graphic design is overly busy and altogether distracting. I was not a huge fan of the original's graphics, and I was looking forward to keeping the newer version for its improved components--but having now used the new version, I don't think I will.

The 12 year old me playing the original would rate this an 8. 20+ years later... not such a high rating.

Nostalgia for the Avalon Hill classic brought me to the FF reboot. Fantasy Flight offers the "classic" AH version and rules set, which I liked playing a lot less 20+ years later. 

Fiddly, long, and far too dependent upon dice rolling as the main pillar of gameplay, which is traveling from point A to point B. There's some interesting gameplay with economy and efficiency, and you can mitigate your need for dice to travel with upgrades. But a bad run of rolling can make or break you. 

I haven't played the FF souped-up version, but from the looks of it, it seems to inject the Fantasy Flight Touch™ to the game. While on the one had the game is given a finite number of turns instead of "first to $2000 credits wins," the addition of combat, more cards, more bits and counters seems to add more chaos and Ameritrashery. 

The theme and the idea of pickup & deliver and exploration all appeal to me. And the sense of humor with the goods and characters and chrome has a great upgrade with FF's production value. But because all this is founded upon getting hosed or not hosed with dice, it's not enough for me to want to play again. 

I recommend this if you love Twilight Imperium, Cosmic Encounter, or the Avalon Hill vintage boxed games in their heyday. It scratches all the same thematic and mechanic itches.

     Standard : A lot of randomness, but also a lot of choices.  Actually a pretty good and interesting mixture of the two.  
     The fact that there is very very little player interaction has a pro and con.  The con is well, that's boring and makes it less of a game and more of an activity. Sure someone wins, but not really against their opponents. they just did better with the same puzzle that was presented...make sense? The pro is that the game is long and sometimes turns can take a while AND sometimes your turn (actually a lot of times) consists of ...doing nothing.  Well, since you don't really have to pay attention to what others are doing too much, it s a great game to 'space off' or find a different activity to do on downtime.
     Its a long game, but it is fun.  A little pricey for the gameplay, but I think the nice components are necessary since the gameplay is not super deep.  Good humor; easy to learn. 
     I'll play it anytime, but I won't be purchasing it.

Good game, but setup takes a long time (at least the first couple of times did) but seem to decrease with every play as you learn how to identify each component. Components are great, as is usual to FFG games. Playing is actually easy and fun. The game seems to go by fast when you're playing. I like it a lot. I recommend it.

At first I wasn't sure I liked this version, but after playing a couple of games, I have decided to keep it. The board is very 'busy' and there are a lot more pieces than the original game which makes set-up, clean-up a bit of a chore, but a dozen zip-lock snack bags speed things up.
Edit: I purchased a wooden organizer that makes setup and tear-down a breeze. Now this game hits the family table more often.

The classic pickup and deliver game has a fun theme, but it's really starting to show its age. There's a huge dose of luck, some of the relics are huge (Jump Start, Yellow Drive) if they come out, but it's the lack of a story arc that bugs me most. Goods don't get more valuable with time, it's just the same nickel and dime action from beginning to end, only the ships get more powerful. At 4 hours this is too long for what it offers, either play to $2000 or play Logistico instead.

RATING: 6
I was leery of the Fantasy Flight remake of Merchant of Venus, a game of which I'm quite fond.  There are certainly improvements to be made, but I was concerned that FFG wouldn't make them, but would focus instead of changing the core of the game into something unrecognizable.  As it is--I think it's still Merchant of Venus, kind of, but the original is much the superior game.  The flaws in the original were the length, the randomness, and the turns in which one doesn't get to do much due to bad dice rolls/random space obstacles.  The new version makes it more difficult to get past the space obstacles, which is irritating, and although the fixed number of turns possibly could have shortened the game, it really doesn't.  Meanwhile, they tinkered with demand for no obvious reason, and they added a bunch of other silly things for no obvious reason other than that they are Fantasy Flight.  

If I'd played this without playing the original, I suspect I'd think that there are a lot of cool things about this game but that it's kind of a bear to get out.  As it is, I find it kind of disappointing and frustrating.  At least you can still play an only slightly modified version of the original game with this!  But there's no goods cup.  Boooo the lack of a goods cup. (1 play)

A modern classic of the pick-up-and-deliver variety. The visuals and background design are well-done, and the new "standard" rules provide more depth and choices, but the classic rules are good as well (and, because it is simpler, mostly my first choice). Lots of fun to be had roaming the galactic cluster buying and selling stuff.

I played the "Classic" version.  I think if this game were 45 minutes I'd give it a 5, but 3 goddamn hours?  No, just...no.  This is the most stultifyingly boring game I've ever had the misfortune of playing. The only reason it doesn't get a 1 is to stay true to the BGG ratings - it is clearly a game, and not "broken" as far as I can tell, but it [i]is[/i] excruciatingly bad.

It's difficult to know how to feel about this one.  The astounding production value and shine are really the main attraction here for me, the game itself has fun dice rolling and some element of planning but it's just too looooong.  A two player game takes hours and can get a bit boring, but it's still interesting trying to get your cargo to the appropriate spots on the board, and dealing with some of the pitfalls along the way - even though there are slightly too many of the dice checks and pirate encounters which can drag turns out even more.

I don't want to sound too negative because the game has it's upsides, but I'm hoping in future plays I'll have a bit more fun and will be persuaded to increase my rating somewhat.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

It's a very fun and satisfying pick-up and deliver game as you work hard to make the board work in your favor. It's important to measure risk vs reward while always having a back-up plan. Me and Yuki always find ourselves coming back to chase a higher pile of cash and break out own records. 

[b]Solitaire Review:[/b] 

The single-player challenges are very rough and unlike in the full game, you can really feel the lucky of the draw here as finding key cultures quickly is more important than ever. With that said, when I managed to successfully complete my first solo run, it was one of the most satisfying board gaming experiences I`ve ever had. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- It's very satisfying to upgrade your ship and reach your destination in one roll, a feat that seemed impossible at the start of the game. 
- Event cards add a lot to the epic feel of the game.
- There isn't too much down time between turns and you're always planning the next best trade route. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Can run a little long for how deep the game really is at times
- Can get frustrating when you can't get to where you want on the board because of the navigation points. But once you learn the ins and outs of the board you can negate this. 
- There are a lot of pieces to fiddle with but most of everything serves a purpose
- Events requiring random Lazer and Shield checks can get annoying
- Set up is pretty quick if you keep everything in Plano boxes, but the clean up is enormous.

Merchant of Venus was one of my first gaming loves and Fantasy Flights version completely sucks the fun from it. Simply put, FFG breaks the game's economy and punishes players with random events that could halt you unnecessarily. The original game had a rule that anything removed from the game was replaced but FFG's version produces new things by triggering random events (which disappear as the game continues) or doing market actions but naturally these dry up over time. 

A remake of the original is included but changes to factories and restriction on 4 players ruins the magic. Try to get the original or print and play it.

Preorder received.  

Will only rate this edition if/when I play the "Standard Game" (i.e. FFG's full revisions) and rating will be based on the Standard Game only.  Though there are minor changes between the AH Edition and FFG's Classic game I don't consider them drastic enough to warrant changing my rating at this time.

11/2/2012 - played Classic Game.  Components are adequate to play classic version in my opinion, as long as you don't want to play with 5+ players.  Yet to try Standard Game, maybe later this month.

This is a surprise purchase for me. I love the theme and the idea of space adventure and trading. I was worried about the excitement level, game time, complexity of game play, and replay value. After two plays, I find it real cool, with lots of potential to house rule and play the way I like it. Will rate it again after my game group decided on the variants suitable for this game. Overall, fun and potentially very engaging game. 

[Update] After bought two years ago, and now played it more than eight times, so far only on the Standard game. MoV is certainly a wonderful and enjoyable game. Tomorrow our game group will play it again and add a variant that we enjoy playing (which I will post later to share with others). This game is exciting to play, especially when we incorporate our variant into it. What an excellent explore and trade game!

Pick up and deliver game set in space, very appealing theme so why not?


The system works really well, the board can be a bit crowded but if you keep the resources and tiles etc all off to the side in a divider box or either just in stacks that would be much better, also if the game had like numbered tokens to go next to each planet once they have been discovered that would be a huge bonus as sometimes trying to see which numbered race is on each planet is confusing.

RATING: 8
A long, meaty, meeeaty game that is - effectively - a light venture-capitalist simulator.  I thoroughly enjoy it; especially that it's clever enough to feature dice without hinging on the rolls you get from those dice.  It has bags of variety and many different winning strategies.  Not for gamers with short attention spans!

2 major criticisms:

1) 
OTOH: there are numerous rules and complexities to the game; some of which are almost daft (the variable event cards are ridiculous to keep track of, as are some of the ship upgrades)
OTOHa: the price you pay for goods doesn't fluctuate with a planet's market! In a game like this, it's the simplest oversight in the world!!
What the hell is that about! Had they stripped off some of the superfluous mechanics, there was scope for a much better set of market mechanics (which, in my books, would have earned it a 9)

2) Perhaps only for licensing purposes, this game features the original and an updated version of this game.  The original is neither distinct nor elegant enough to sit happily alongside the revision.  It feels like an expense that has been tacked on to appease the original publisher rather than a new audience... then again, maybe the die hard fans just wanted a remake.

RATING: 4
My rating only goes for the revised edition included in the box.

Hey you guys, you know what the original Merchant of Venus was missing? More randomness and game length! Well wait no longer as the "revised" edition includes both those elements that we all long so much for in modern games. Seriously fantasy flight? You decided that it would be a great idea to make this 3+ hour game longer? At least in the original you had an idea how well you were doing throughout the entire game as money was open. In this game you can be blindsided in scoring as someone scores upwards of $300 more because he rolled doubles which actually happened in my one play. Seriously because someone rolled doubles at the end they win? That's some grade A BS. That junk belongs in relics like Talisman, not Merchant of Venus. Oh boy I forgot, another element they though would be really cool to add in an attempt to spice up the game is take that cards. Cards that basically negate points from other players for very little to no reason. How do you get said cards? Oh yeah, they are absolutely random and arbitarary again? Forget strategy and skill as you can just draw a card that makes someone lose tons of points for very little reason. Just stupid decisions all around. 

At least this version includes the original game which is a masterpiece that did not need a broken "revised" edition. You should just go ahead and throw away all the components that are only needed for the revised edition, you won't be using them anyways.

I really wanted to love this game, and I forced my way through it, but man..the fun factor wasn't mind blowing enough to warrant the tedious setup.  Also, there was almost zero player interaction.  Turns take a long time, and you have to sit around waiting A LOT.

The first meaty, long game I've really enjoyed in a long while. There's quite a bit going on here, nothing too overwhelming once you understand the rules (but also some weird exception rules which are annoying to remember).

Players are space traders jumping from system to system, buying low and selling high. Along the way there are random encounters and hazards and the occasional pirate. None of the encounters are too harsh, everything just fit right in.

Fame seems a bit weird to me. Completing missions, for example, earn far too little to be worth the trouble unless you already happen to be in a particular system. The rules for drilling asteroids also seem a bit weird to me (maybe I got these rules wrong).

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed exploring new aliens and finding searching around for bargains and maximizing profits.

[Classic game]
Even better. Every problem I had with the standard game seems to be fixed in the classic version. Missions, drilling and pirate encounters are no longer a drag of excessive rules additions.

The only thing I would've like is a way to mitigate bad rolls as per the standard game.

Solitaire possible.

I rate this 2nd edition version of the game slightly lower than the Avalon Hill version, even though it has more content in the form of an addition "updated version" and a workable solo version, because the components (and some condensing of the race tokens) are, IMHO, very difficult to distinguish when playing.  The old AH version did a very good job with making it easy to tell what each piece was and did.

Part efficiency optimization puzzle, part space pilot career simulation, with helpings of chaos and randomness throughout. May certainly appeal to those who don't get a headache from the former and aren't put off by the gratuitous trimmings of the latter. There are some neat design solutions, but the whole is not a marvel of cohesion and it's certainly not brief: we cut our game short after 20 turns as it had begun to wear out its welcome (although it would probably not have killed us to continue). I wouldn't mind playing the classic game for comparison.

Finally got to play one of the traditional board game classics at BGG Con 2014... and it left me somewhat underwhelmed.  It's probably the game that invented or at least defined the pick-up and deliver genre but it's not the first pick up and deliver I've played and I just never got into it. First, it's a beast to set up, then it has a lot of rules that are not intuitive, and lastly it has very little theme. 

I'm glad I played it, but if I never play again it wouldn't bother me in slightest.

There is a new "Standard" version of the game along with the Classic version of the game, so I will have to try both.  Nice touch adding both versions, Fantasy Flight!  :-)  So far, I have played each version and the jury is still out as to which one I prefer.  I do hear that more people tend to prefer the classic version, though.  So far, though, this is my favorite pure pickup-and-deliver game.  (Xia beats it, but Xia is also a sandbox game, so pickup-and-deliver isn't the pure focus in that game.)

Based on one four-player game.  This is a fun game but it has a lot of set up time and the game can play very long especially if any of the players aren't familiar with the game.  I would only be interested in playing this if it went much faster and/or we were sure of all the rules.  The scoring at the end is really wacky given the potential for odd mulipliers and such.

I have ordered a copy just to have a chance to explore it more.  Ultimately I think I will prefer the original.  But I want to see what all they did to this game.  I think they did a good job of innovating.  I'm just not sure if I wanted the game changed.

Then we played a two player version with my son in less than 2 1/2 hours. I think this is a perfect three player game.

Wavering between 7 and 8 based on number of players. I think it can be a bit long with 4 but works very well at 2 or 3 players. I  find it extremely thematic with lots of options for the players. Sort of an Empire Builder on steroids. It's fiddly but that's actually part of the charm in this case.

[Update] Full game starts to drag around round 20. Once everything has been discovered it becomes a mathematical exercise and loses the sense of adventure. Might work best with the light speed 15 round variant.

Merchant of Venus uses many elements which come together to form a very interesting game. Players take on the roles of space traders who move their ships through interconnected systems discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities in a unique supply-and-demand system, their earnings can be used to purchase better ships and equipment (shields, lasers, engines, etc...) and construct their own spaceports (which speed up trading) and factories (which create better commodities). Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat. The player who first acquires enough total value ($1000, $2000, $3000, $4000) in cash and port/factory deeds takes the day.

Not sure which version I prefer.  Both will take a while although the classic should fly once you get the game down.  I really enjoy the drawing from a cup to determine demand instead of FFG changing it to cycling through three different tiles and settings.  FFG version is also quite a bit more fiddly and more random, but there is some fun chrome with missions, honor, and rewards.  Hated the laser and shield checks early in the game as I felt I could get nowhere as making the checks is highly unlikely the first third to half of the game.

I played the original Merchant of Venus years ago. I liked it then, I liked the look of this edition, and I bought this copy specifically to have the original (more or less) game. Some minor problems with this edition (no good place to put demand and passenger tokens on the board) and one major problem: WHERE IS JELLYBEAST LANDING??? But all in all I'm glad to have a copy of this, and I plan to give the "Standard" game a try soon. (Rating is for "classic" rules.)

c10 tokens became a problem straightaway, so I cut sticks from the original punchcard to make c20 tokens so they would feel as similar as the other credits.

As far as pick-up-and-delivery games go, this is a weird one.  It's much more luck dependent than many other ones, and sometimes you spend too much time looks for answers rather than looking for different questions.  The solo game is good but brutally difficult with bad luck.  I find this hard to recommend when you could just play Merchants & Marauders.

This is an old AH title that has held up very well.  It is the best implementation of a roll and move mechanic in any game.  You pick up and deliver goods from different planets making money. You can upgrade your ship, deliver passengers, buy factory's, etc.  The game only has a 4 player count rather than the original game that has 6 but that is good as I have played this 6 player and it is not fun.  

There is FF specific game in this edition as well.  I have not played but my understanding is that it runs longer than classic to 2000 credits.  

This is one of my favorite games and it only gets better each time I play it.

E' un gioco molto complesso di movement, compravendita merci, sviluppo dell'astronave e risoluzione di obiettivi.
Ci si muove sulle rotte tra un pianeta e l'altro mediante tiro dei dadi, non mancano imprevisti ed eventi casuali sul percorso.
Ogni pianeta, una volta scoperto la prima volta, rende disponibile la razza che lo abita e le relative merci e potenziamenti da essa vendute.
Il gioco si basa poi sul portare merci e passeggeri da un pianeta all'altro secondo l'andamento dei mercati e dalla domanda di acquisto.
Una partita dura diverse ore, a mio avviso sarebbe più godibile con un numero di turni ridotto. Esiste una modalità secondaria per giocare solo 15 dei 30 turni previsti.

After 3 plays I am very disappointed.  The movement system is horrible.  One game a player got to go nowhere for 5 turns.  Some fun.  Bleh.  I guess roll and move isn't my thing.  I have seen a movement variant using chits instead of dice.  As is, I rate this game a 4.  The dice rolls seem to dictate the winner - lots of high rolls or the 'right' numbers provides an easy win.

I do like this game: the aesthetics appeal to me, I also appreciate the cleverness of the design with some clever choices of mechanics that lift it above other pick up and delivers. However, it's a dice-based game and I really do struggle with dice - despite the number of dice that get rolled, I never seem to get the breaks and consistently lose against those folk who do. Because you don't draw routes like you do in crayon rails there's a lot you have to keep your eye on to make sure that you're always on the best "run-rate". I struggle with that aspect of the game.

The rating is basically for the revised original version.  I give the AH version at least an 8, but this eyesore is jaw-droppingly bad.  SO much clutter makes looking at the board so much more difficult than it needed, and the plethora of useless components and overwrought graphics was just awful.  It even made learning the game for the newbies tough, and the drives looked like separate areas so we forgot they took hold space...  Why?  WHY????

I like the variable board layout. I can see this being fun to play every once in a while just to see how the layout changes each game. The big reason why I don't rate it higher is because the game is about ten turns too long. I feel like the game should end about five turns after exploring the last secret ending just because the rest of the game is nothing more than depleting the resources left on the board. The economic system is amusing, but it is hard to take the game seriously with how much luck is involved in traversing space.

Rating the standard version here, as I haven't played the classic yet. It's long. Really long. We unanimously agreed to cut it short at the half-way mark. The gameplay is mostly decent, though I have to think it gets quite repetitive after all of the aliens are discovered. I don't mind a bit of pickup and deliver, but another two hours of it would have surely killed me. The worst part is the randomness of the dice. Now, I was pretty forgiving of the roll and move initially; the assignment of the dice to various controls and equipment while still counting them in your movement is both clever and flexible. But when a poor roll can send you off the wrong direction, quadrupling the length of your path, that's quite annoying--especially near the end of the game. Speaking of which, how do you plan for the end? Without any confidence you can get to your destination, it's quite risky to purchase goods for delivery, as that just lowers your score if a bad roll keeps you from completing the objective. Does everyone sit around for the last three turns of the game? This one is not for me. I'll try classic sometime.

More than anything else, MoV seems like a "nostalgia game" to me.  It is like a good game from my youth that is fun to revisit.  It has a cool retro-vibe that feels fun without being tense, stressful, confrontational or tight.   It has a charming sense of humour, a pleasant look-and-feel and an arc that nicely escalates from being slow & simple to moderately multi-faceted. It's more of a turtle than a hare, but a winner nevertheless.

After 2 turns we all become kids again staring at the stars with a sense of marvel and the pleasure of discovering strange, funny cultures to trade with: the galaxy is alive. Very low interaction, and a bit on the long-ish side with a lot of luck; also, I don't like the flimsy player ship boards.

Very likely this is not a game for everyone, but hardly a game you won't like AT ALL, given the 3 very different versions included (classic, standard, solo); personally I like the standard more, but it's just great to have all of them in one box.

First game was light speed 15 round Standard. Second game was full 30 rounds Standard. Took 4.5 hours. Our game group all had a great time. We were a bit tired, since we were not used to playing one game for such a long time.

Amazing game and it's so satisfying to make some profitable trades. The only problem is the game length. I have quite happily played it solo. But my game group is never really small enough to play this without too many players (or a couple of people feeling left out because of how amazing it looks!). Another in our group has Firefly still sitting unplayed (he's not even attempted it solo yet). Even though I spent a lot of time to organised this with special storage to reduce the set-up time to a few minutes, I feel I should let this go to someone who will play it more :(

I won my first game, but only because luck was on my side.  I had a great start and was rolling dice well.  Another player was really rolling poorly.

Good game, I like it.  But... waaaayyyy too long (first game with rules explanation was 6 hours) and fiddly.  Dice may screw you over too.  Glad I got a chance to try it, but NOT a title I would be seeking to play in the future.

I had been wanting to play Merchant of Venus for a long time, so I was pretty pumped to receive it in a math trade here at BGG.  When I got around to playing the game, however, I couldn't have been more disappointed.  My wife and I couldn't even get through a whole game due to how bored we were.  I was convinced we were potentially playing the game wrong; all it seemed like we were doing was slowly moving around the board and trying to calculate the easiest routes to slowly start building up money.  After reading more online, it turns out that's all the game is.

Our favorite part of the game was all the different races of aliens and their funny goods.  Outside of that initial discovery period, however,  there just wasn't anything there to hold our interest.  I can't see myself ever playing this over something like Xia, a space game that gives you a lot more freedom in what you do from turn.

Feels like a game well ahead of its time, even if it is a roll-n-move. I swear I'll get through an entire play without realizing I made some rules error.

One step forward, two steps back. The technologies and random encounters are nice, but the shield/laser system and the fame that goes along with it are much ado about nothing. I prefer the classic version.

Nicer components, rules are still fairly large. Missing 5+6 players and planets run dry too often. I also miss the sacrifice you make in choosing different ships.

New pilots and missions+rewards are nice and of course FFG couldn't resist adding cards to the game :)

Overall still a good game, but it seems to run on for too long. Maybe 25 turns is more appropriate.

After playing a FFG game (not original rules): It feels like a decent pick-up-and-deliver game with a touch more luck than most PUADs and an interesting level of Talisman-like explorations (which can be avoided altogether by missing those routes).  I can see why it's polarizing people.  But it's still good fun and I'd play it again -- with people who've played it before.  Rate this version 7.

After playing a classic game (original rules): SO much better. I get why FFG updated the rules to make it a more campy space adventure but... it really wasn't needed.  MoV is a solid PUAD with just enough luck to keep it interesting, a number of possible upgrade paths to victory, and still plenty of charm.  I can STILL see why PUAD purists might not like it, but it's great at what it does and still holds up on its own terms 30+ years after its release.

I'm only going to review the new version here, the classic game is fine.

This is not Merchant of Venus. Imagine you had a Ferrari. You take out the engine, the gearbox, and everything else except the body and replace them with the components from an old Yugo. If you told someone it was a Ferrari, and then they drove it, they would be pretty upset with you. That's kind of how I felt about this game. Except for the map, this game only bears a modest resemblance to MoV.

Movement in the game has been completely redone, in what I consider a negative way. Before, except for the possibility of having to pay a bit of cash, it was pretty easy to reliably plan out a travel path. Now, you need to make numerous die checks, and the penalty for failing is pretty high. The cost for movement in this version is significantly higher than in the original, where you could trust that you could bypass hazards if you invested properly.

Selling has been tweaked, again for the worse. Now, when you sell somewhere, the demand for the good changes, pseudo-randomly. You don't know how it will change at first, but eventually you see what order the +/=/- markers are in. If the demand changed based on units sold or bought or something, then I could understand changing how demands work, but it doesn't, it's random.

The ship has changed. Instead of a simple ship with holds for cargo and fares, and the few pieces of equipment you have, you now have several different things you need to upgrade in order to make hazard checks, adding more complexity. This also has the added affect of diverting more of your money to maintaining your ship instead of buying goods or infrastructure.

Overall, they have completely changed the nature of the game. In the original, you could find routes that were relatively safe and profitable, or you could try riskier routes. Now all routes have similar hazards. Before, you could choose to spend of your money to mitigate risks and improve your movement, now risk is still dependent on randomness and cannot be reliably mitigated. Before, demands made reasonable sense, the longer something went without being sold, the greater chance of getting more money for it. Now, the bonus or loss to sales is completely independent of this and is mostly random. In short, they've injected a load of randomness into this game, which fundamentally changes its nature from what it was.

This is not Merchant. I almost get the feeling that they had a mediocre pick up and deliver game in the works and bought the MoV name so they could sell more copies. No, no, a thousand times no.

This solves some of the math and runaway leader problems of the beloved (to me) first edition. It remains quite long and with significant luck involved (not usually a good mix, but pretty decent here with theme). What really makes it soar is the solo version, which I have played dozens of times. Superb.

RATING: 8
The "Classic Rules" are a tightly designed 2-4 player intergalactic trade/economy game that doesn't get bogged down with rules so you can really focus on the most optimal trade routes while investing in your ship and lucrative factories and star-bases!

As stated, the score and comments are based on the "Classic Rules". If you want to throw all those tight rules out in favor of bloated, unwieldy rules with a hefty helping of randomness, then try the "Standard Rules". I would give them a score of "5" if I was feeling generous...

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]8[/COLOR]):

[i]My son and I are still enjoying this game and I have also managed to get in a few 3/4p games. MoV is still my favorite pick up and deliver game, partly because I also enjoy the exploration that takes place in the beginning of the game. I also love the theme and humor found in the game. The only downside to this game is the set up and clean up is a bear, which holds this game back from getting played even more, but we have been making more of an effort to play this more since we both have a blast when we play and it's an excellent 2p game.[/i]

Initial thoughts and rating (9):

[i]- The sci-fi theme and the pick up and deliver mechanic found in this game. 
- Having to explore before you can really start selling goods because you are trying to find good trade routes to exploit.
- Even though this is a roll and move it actually has some thoughtful choices you need to make when navigating.
- The artifacts introduce some nice perks that may be found throughout the game.
- For a game with so much depth, it is relatively easy to teach once you have the rules down yourself.
- Plays great with 2.[/i]

First impression after one play through is rather weak. We were two players that randomly flew around the galaxy and occasionally managed to make good deals. The problem for me is the game length - I would like to distill this game into half of its length. I was hoping that this game would "explain" the pick-up-and-delivery mechanism. It seems like this game using this mechanism didn't enthused me either. 

I'll try it on three players before I let it go.

Based on one play (new rules): This is quite a dull game. You move around pickup up merchandise form one race in order to bring it to another. There are very few surprises and the one who finds the best route first, likely by simply discovering two races that can ship to each other in close proximity will win. Not much strategy or fun. Very repetitive, so play the short version first to ensure you like it.

I'm a big fan of the original, but I'm OK with this being a different game. As expected, this one focused less on buying and selling and more on tricking out your ship, beating up pirates, and completing quests. That's fine with me; I tried to play to that. The execution was lacking though. Wasted turns--an occasional occurrence in the original--happened a lot more often here. Graphic design was way too busy; it was nearly impossible to tell which goods were "gold", "silver", etc. And, if anything, the game was even more random. I think I'll stick with the original.

A classic game that I'm glad finally got reprinted. Unfortunately FFG got the final say on it instead of Stronghold. I'm glad they worked out something together as I fear the only version we would have had floating on the market had FFG won is the new "standard" version.

First the bad. The board is gaudy but it works well enough. The biggest foul in my book is how they decided to rename the factory good and use a slightly different coloring on it. It's incredibly difficult to figure out which one it is at first glance. The standard game is not good and a waste of components as well as increasing the price which I'm sure put a lot of people off. This game retailed for $80 and could have been in the $50 without all that unnecessary crap. I'd rather them include various expansions or optional content for MoV instead of making a wholly useless and terrible new edition. I really wish Stronghold had gotten it as I'm curious to see what the quality would have been as well as if they would have continued to support it.

The good. The game still holds up today, although asking someone to calculate 10% of their total sales/buys on a spaceport can turn some people off even though the math is incredibly simple. Not to mention it's a roll and move, but it handles it quite well. Sure you can roll a 4 with 4 dice, but it doesn't happen often and it can be funny when it does. The rules are written well enough, but it's not the easiest to find everything. Overall, a game that I've enjoyed my plays of.

RATING: 6
A lot of rules to crunch through when playing the standard game. Have yet to play classic. 

The Standard game was enjoyable, but seemed a little long for what it is when playing with 4. 2 or 3 would probably be better. Lots of pieces and long setup and breakdown. Organization is a must.

The game is sort of like a sci-fi Merchants and Marauders in space but, with less Marauder and more Merchant.

edit:
after one standard game and two classic games I will say that classic isn't as good of an experience as standard. Classic is a little less fiddly and complex (it also plays faster), but the extra chrome in standard makes for a more enjoyable experience despite it's particular problems. I'd rate the classic a 7 or 7.5. It's ok. 

The main issues I have with this game that kill it for me is the large amount of different shaped tokens that make setup and breakdown a pain along with the fact that you are also trying to keep classic and standard components separate. If this was a great game to me I wouldn't have an issue with this. But since it's merely ok I'm not encouraged to deal with the setup and breakdown of the game. 

The other issue is that the game is essentially long for what it is. I think the Roll and move mechanic in the game is and old school design that definitely should have been replaced. It slows things down and just gets tedious after awhile. Need to be in a patient mood to play this.

Overall I think I'm going to give this game a 7.5 (7 for my bgg rating since I don't do .5's anymore) I'll definitely play it if someone suggests it, but I'm not going to own it anymore.

For what it's worth I prefer Railways of the world and Merchants and Marauders over this game (there is a bit of overlap there). Had movement been handled like either of those games I think it would have improved the game quite a bit.

While I like the game I just don't feel it's quite there. It just barely misses the mark and I find that kind of frustrating as I want to like the game more. I think someone could do the idea of this game better. Maybe Firefly the board game is better?

Played the standard game which was quite a success! Played it with 4 player, all beginners, and total playtime was about 4h although it didn't feel that long. Sure there was some downtime, but it was surprisingly minimal. At first 30 rounds seemed like too much, but it was really awesome to see the progress of my ship and visit all the places around the galaxy. I really liked this game and see a lot of potential. Hopefully it gets more expansions, since more stuff is definitely what this game needs! 

This game was probably the best surprise this year, I'd want to play again soon! At some point I also have to check the classic rules.

Since none of us had played this before, it took us almost 2 hours to set up the board and get playing.  We had a blast once we were underway, however.  Very well fleshed-out game with high replay value and interesting dynamics.  It's not without its flaws, but it's a whole lot of fun.

Classic Game:

I really enjoy the humor in this game and the general mechanics work very nicely.  I really love the different ships and how each of them helps you out.  The randomness of the movement can occasionally suck when you don't get to do what you wanted this turn, but it's all part of the game.

Standard Game:

After learning the classic game and loving it, I started reading the rules for this version and just gave up.  Seems really bloated and unnecessary.  I'm starting to seriously question FFG's design goals for games.  I can't imagine anyone thinking the original game needed these many updates/extras.

Love this game.  So much to do, so many ways to play.  It has a lot of strategies you can do.  Do I do missions, buy and sell goods, transport passengers, explore early, kill pirates, get fame, money, etc.

It takes for 4 people about 4 hours, but you don't even notice the time go by because there is so much to think about and do.  

It is not as deep as "Twilight Imperium" but has a similar feeling.  

I added a war element to the game and even though you wouldn't play it as a war game, it adds another factor to consider as you decide where and when to go to certain places.  I think that was the only thing lacking because flying around doing all I mentioned is great but the war element adds just a little more tension.

Without the war element is what I based the game on and I think it is definitely a "10".

Cool game, if it would not take that long. The game features great components and it has a lot of components! At your turn you start with dice rolling. Three dice and the outcome will limit your opportunities. I found out that navigation can be frustrating and you possibly will be sent in an unwanted direction. Getting a good overview is also challenging. You have to look closely to see who is where and then the ways to get there are not always as straight forward as it can be.
The game has a lot of text where you have to cope with and this slows the game play down. What other players are doing is hardly influencing your game play. The universe is that big, there is space for everybody.

RATING: 6
I would have enjoyed my one play of this game (not the classic version, and only 2/3 of the game finished, which took us four hours) if I were consuming beer. That way, my opponents would be more prone to chat while waiting for their turns -- there really isn't much to pay attention to when it's not your turn. Or I could have been more relaxed and unconcerned by how luck dependent this game is; it's not a particularly strategically deep game.

Although it's not strategically deep, it's quite analytical. The core mechanic of MoV is pick-up-and-deliver, and I truly love the logistical challenges that this offers. However, as with many games that share this mechanic, it's a lot of fun planning your turn, but it's not fun doing them, especially if the main mechanic of moving is roll-and-move. At least the game allows the players to mitigate the luck somewhat with special powers that can be purchased.

Like the majority of Fantasy Flight games, the artwork induces visual vertigo -- individual icons and tiles are striking, but they do not work together as a whole.

Verdict: If this game lasted a maximum of two hours, then it would be great, but at 4-5 hours, MoV is way too long for what it is.

RATING: 7
Thematically speaking, Merchant of Venus is an amazing game. It's easy to get immersed in the world of these aliens and their wacky exports, especially with the aid of the beautiful components.
That being said, this game isn't for everyone. There is quite a bit of luck involved with space travel. Rolling the dice for movement can lead to some sticky situations, but can be mitigated by certain decisions.
My real problem lies with the artifact tokens. One player can collect massive amounts of power while another keeps running into hazards. This doesn't affect my rating too much because I think I could tweak this during setup to fix it.

Overall: I waited a long time to get my hands on Merchant of Venus and it didn't disappoint. Delivering space goods definitely has it's ups and downs, but the journey is ultimately very enjoyable.

This was kind of a grail game to get to play.  First time this week w/c 5th Sept 2016 !
Pick and delivery games take a long time, period.
If you can't accept that , then perhaps the genre is not for you.
This is kind of how i feel, having played a variety of pick and delivery games, i really do need to be in the right mood and have friends with lots of spare time.  They tend to leave me knowing i've lost, but with 2 hours additional game play to go.

This was easy to pick up (no pun intended) and plays relatively smoothly.  Dice rolls can hose your progress between turns, but less so overall than, say, firefly.
The game evolves well by splitting the story from one of planet discovery and a cash grab into a pick up & deliver and achieve missions to earn rewards.  The fact that both are required for your final game scoring just show how well designed it is.

I think we might prefer the new version over the original (we haven't tried 2nd edition Classic). We prefer the lack of fiddliness and percentage math, but the movement seems slower than I remember, and the pacing isn't as satisfying. It'll take a few more plays to come to a final decision.

RATING: 2
(+) Colorful game with enough humour to somewhat counter its dreadful and unnecessary weightful nature

(+) Starting mechanic in which inhabitants of plantets get randomly distributed while 'exploring' and the planning of routes using dice feels somewhat thematic

(-) This games takes waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long for what it is. 30 Rounds of pure luck dependant agony: a brainless waste of uninteresting an repetitive play for hours and hours and hours in a row.

(-) This game is frustratingly luck dependant in each and every aspect of the game: the position of inhabitants by drawing random cards, drawing encounter cards with totally random events which could reward you richly or slam you down badly for no reason at all, the constant rolling of dice to fight pirates, to determine your route, simply to get or lose points, ... 

(-) Rules of this game are far too heavy, and text on encounter cards often is too lengthy or unclear for the brainless stupid gameplay it offers.

(-) Gameplay starts getting dreadfully repetitive after the first 10 rounds: find a few systems close to each other which can trade and which are connected with a path in which you won't encounter too many annoyances. Pick up some tiles, deliver them making some profit. Repeat. Over and over and over and over again.

(-) According to BGG there is commodity speculation in this game. This is ridiculous! The prices of goods are not determined by supply and demand, but by simply looping through the same 3 tiles uncaring wheather you sold little or much. The price difference is also too low to really care about this mechanic anyway

Awful, awful game - stay away unless you are willing to spend hours getting lucky or getting crushed by rolling dice and drawing cards!

Approx game time: WAY TOO LONG!

If I can get a copy of this cheap, I will probably buy it.  I really like the components and the minor rules additions to the "Classic Game" but do not like the reduced player count or the cosmetic changes to the aliens (the Shenna are cat people and there are no furries in the game at all anymore!).  I have not played the "Standard Game" and cannot speak to that.  If some other company decided to redo this one (I'm looking at you, Stronghold!) and does it right, I'll get behind it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This rating reflects the standard version of the game primarily.  And what were FFG thinking?

Almost every change is for the worse!

-  Artwork:  Comically overly busy that it makes it hard to play the game.  They embiggened the counters and placed them inside each system which embiggened the systems, so much so the board is completely crowded.  Does this game take place in the vastness of space or in phone booth? 
-  Why the "market shifts" that minimally change the prices (so you have to have 3 on every regular good), encourage "chicken play" and cause fiddling around with the prices every turn.
-  Why add wristage the penalty spaces?  In addition, to slowing does movement, sometimes to a dead stop, because they are still arranged so you often have to go through different ones in sequence, it means you have develop all 3 ways to pass them:  laser, shields AND pilot.  Or you WILL get stuck.
-  Why add fame that you have to track, though you probably will earn plenty of in spite of yourself?
-  Why change a replenishment system (aka the Cup) the works well to one that randomly spills out the entire supply of goods in a system all at once?
-  Why the pirates that are nearly impossible to defeat and so they simply block the board?
-  Why are lasers so much better against pirates than shield or pilots?  Then why do lasers cost the same price as shields?
-  Why "personal goals" that completely imbalanced--some are extremely easy to get that you probably will do anyway (deliver two goods to this system), others much more difficult and/or expensive and require going out of your way?
-  Ships now have no tradeoffs--you can get maximum space AND maximum speed (subject only to cash limitations)  Extra holds are ridiculously cheap and do not slow down your ship.  A drive takes up no space.  Only 2 of the new ship technologies take up any hold space at all and only 5 take up your 3 "ship upgrade" slots  (Will you ever need more than 3?).  The rest take up no space at all.
-  Why the Fuzzy Dice?  They cost $30 and essentially the WORST get you is 3 fame points worth $30 and they they could double the value for your fame, if you roll doubles, usually worth $200 or more.  AND IT TAKES UP NO SPACE ON YOUR SHIP!  No reason ever to not buy one!

With all of these changes you get a game that takes nearly double the playing time with far more randomness. 

Even the classic game has some questionable changes:
-  Using IOU purchases not being a "buy" (making discovering system even more valuable than they already were.)
-  Demands paying off on Factory Goods (making Factories even better than they were)
-  Paying Factory commissions immediately, but forcing you to wait for port commissions until the end of the turn.  Why the picayune difference?

At least these aren't completely game breaking as the Standard game changes are.

RATING: 4
Rating based on playing the "classic version."

A game I thought I would like given that I enjoy economic games and generally don't mind the fiddlyness of old AH games. But it doesn't seem to quite work as an economic game. 

If this were a wargame, I'd say that the designer got the scale wrong. What I mean is that the game requires players to go through too many turns repeating the same action over and over again to get the proper payoff for the actual  decisions you make. It's not that there is downtime, as I've seen others criticize the game for, but that there are too many "empty" turns. I understand part of this is to incentivize building space ports since they allow you to land on one turn, buy/sell as much as you'd like and then take off the next turn (rather than the limit of one buy and sell for planets/neutral stations).

Movement has similar issues. I don't mind roll-and-move per se, and I think it could have worked in this game. And the problem isn't really with the rolls for raw movement. The problem stems from the navigation spaces. The 2-4 d6 rolled for movement normally would give a pretty reasonable distribution for movement, but the navigation spaces mean that one ship may be stopped in its tracks for one or two turns, while another gets a perfect roll and flies to its destination in a single turn. And that wouldn't be so bad...if there was anything else you did on your turn when your ship is stuck in the middle of nowhere for a couple of turns. But you can't do anything else, which results for the potential for multiple turns without any decisions to be made. 

As a thematic game, MoV also fails. There's just really nothing of interest to build a story or immerse you into the game. At its heart, it's an economic game, which would be fine if didn't fail as an economic game. The different races, ship attributes, etc. just don't matter. They're simply defining who can trade for what and providing some decisions about how/when to invest your capital.

And then there's FFG's presentation. The board is extremely busy, as are all the components. Just sorting out which pieces you need for the standard game is a chore. Even worse, a ton of basic information that could have been included is absent from the board:  movement costs, relic uses, explanation of what the spaces are, etc. Most of these become secondhand after playing for a bit, but they could have been included on the board for easy reference by the players. And the rules. Oh my, are the rules bad. What should have been 2 or 3 concise rules has things scattered seemingly arbitrarily throughout the rules. Early on the rules tell you to choose a navigation die...but it doesn't tell you how to use that die until somewhere else in the rules. The rules fail both at teaching the game and as a reference.

I would try the new/standard version, but rather than trying to fix the economic game, it sounds like it tries to make the game more thematic. But MoV isn't built to provide a thematic experience, and trying to make it more thematic would seem to just make it worse.

RATING: 10
Really enjoying the new standard version, and I think this is a good improvement on the original.  Having the automatic 1 pip thrust control from the start can help a lot with bad rolls at the beginning before you've improved your ship much, and it's much rarer that I feel like I spend multiple turns between planets because of bad rolls. You still have the fun and frustrating aspect of having to get through a maze of nav points and telegates. I originally felt the game still took at little too long, but using more dice and taking simultaneous turns can really speed it up (when 2 players wanted to go to the same place, then we use turn order, but at least with 2-3 players it usually only happens once or twice a game).  The light speed variant doesn't seem that attractive, since half the fun is exploring all the worlds and figuring out possible trade routes as you go.

Update: Still playing the standard game, but I think the fame points are really undervalued. It is really not worth going out of your way to complete missions or do much of anything that earns fame for such a meager return of $10, and Fuzzy Dice is just stupid luck at the end.  I think 2-player, ideally with simultaneous rolls if you're very experienced, is the best way to play.  There is so little interaction, there is little benefit to having more players at the cost of so much downtime.

Update update:  finally played classic with the new edition, and I feel stupid for waiting so long. After playing 3 games in a row, my wife and I agreed classic is so much better than standard.  It plays a lot faster and just focuses on the main point of the game, pickup and deliver.  Finding your home world is nowhere near as important, and as long as you get 1 shield, you can basically ignore hazards, as opposed to the constant shield/laser/pilot rolls, using them up and buying them again.  Raised my rating to 9. I don't know if we'll ever play Standard again.

Upgraded to 10.  My wife and I just enjoy it so much. We really like how we can modulate how much money to play to win depending on how much time we have, and that determines how best to invest in ships and spaceports to get a return on investment.

This is definitely what I term an "event" game.

I like that Merchant allows a player to formulate and actually carry out a plan, but it does it at the price of a long playing time and tons of chits. I loved the way it felt while playing -100% engaging (What will I do next? What will my best route be? How can I get the resources/upgrades/fame/income that I need???)

On the other hand, I would need plano boxes or the set up and break down time alone would deter me from ever playing! (It would be the best game  just sitting on the shelf, but still.)

I played AH too long ago to remember the components, but for FFG:

* Before playing, separate out the goods and other counters by culture into baggies. Use the upper-right corner.

* Separate player components by color.

* Get a large dice bag as your cup.

Which cultures needed the good was pretty easy. Just check the next four numbers in sequence.

FFG's Merchant of Venus is a best-case scenario for a reprint.

Although I wanted to like this anyway, it is continuing to grow on me, and I think I'm seeing increasing depth, as a result of which I am enjoying the game more and more. Movement is a particular delight.

Haven't played the 'Standard Game' - will probably try it eventually solo. I'd like to figure out a way to use some of the nice bits for Standard in the Classic Game.

I never played the original, but have done my best to study up the differences. I am inclining to 'house rule' that factory goods can't earn demand bonuses, as factories played very strong in our first few games and they seem to need to be trimmed back to the original edition's strength. Not sure about the missing orbit point - if it was left out for balance then the new edition's map might be worth sticking with.

FFG seem to have taken a bit of a kicking over this one. The differences between this edition's Classic game and AH PnP are minor and easily changed; the design is perfectly functional and it is nice-looking. I like the corny 50s/60s SF art of the original edition, but the cover is great on this new game, really in the spirit of the game, but different, and new. The board is entirely functional (although you do have to unfold it carefully). And maybe the Standard game is a mess (don't know, haven't tried it), but I am sure that eventually someone could come up with some neat variants by cannibalizing the pieces/rules.

The money is pretty crap, but entirely a non-issue for me - I have plenty alternative chips and money sets, so very rarely use the money in a given game anyway. Game designers - please do keep your printing costs down by including crappy money in your games, I implore you!

I would run out and buy an Ace Trucking retheme in a heart beat, though. 10-10, good buddies!

[b]Classic game[/b] - 1 game, 1 solo run
rating = [b]2[/b]

Not sure why this game depressed me so badly, but maybe because: This is a MPS game and I like those if there's a strong story element. In classic game there is none. The game is thematic, it's just not narrative as it's just rinse and repeat. It's pick up and deliver where you are deliver stuff from A to B and roll dice to get from here to there. And it's 2 hours: pick up stuff, deliver stuff, repeat and repeat and repeat and you would like it to stop, but it's not quite there yet. It's one of those "it feels like work" games from days of yore where work was not as stressful as today, but was instead sometimes boring and meaningless. 

[b]FFG game[/b] (aka standard game) - 1 solo run
rating = [b]3.5[/b]

A couple of levels better. At least for what I want out of gaming. Yes, it's also longer by at least 50%, but there's more of feel of story progressing. Decision to swap different space ships with only one you can upgrade is just so obviously better as it gives you the rewarding please of building your ship and there's narrative in this as well. The random events add not only a bit of story (tiny bit, but still), but also much needed variety to the game. I'm not sure the interaction makes much sense: you can attack other players (via random events) but take infamy points, so you have to calculate if it's worth it. Seems to me it's a bit too long, but truly I can't find a reason to play the classic game again. 

[b]as remakes go it's a 10[/b]
Hard to admit it, given other FFGs misses and some hits (for sure). Idea to keep the old game and add a new version works as the new version modernises the game and makes it into something new and more suited to today's players (of certain preferences), and for the others there's the classic game. New version reminds me of old school computer games of running a ship and flying around space, so there's the much needed emphatic connection to basically a game of micro economy (buy stuff, sell stuff).

EDIT: maaybe I'd like to try FFG version one time. that's it.

Да, нет войны, да каждый занимается своими колхозом... А она (война) сюда разве нужна? Да и разве плохо что никто никому не мешает, главное ходы бегут быстро и особого даунтайма в игре нет. Плюс можно играть и одному!

(played standard version)
I think being a space merchant is a great theme for a game and FFG has made a nice looking reprint of the classic. But as a remake of a classic it also has some baggage. For me Merchant of Venus takes wayyyyy to long and gets boring to the point of "Please be over soon! Why can't this finally end?". In the right mindset I can enjoy the game, but propably don't want to play it all that often.

Fantastic fun.  Played Standard and Classic Rules, and both versions are good. Great components, nice rulebook, and stellar artwork (maybe the best box art I have ever seen).  Gameplay was fun with a good mix of strategy and luck.  Excellent reprint, Fantasy Flight!

Also played a solo game which was fun. Quite difficult with the Challenge Cards.

This is superior to the first in graphics and perhaps gameplay, although I don't have eyes to play the advanced version.  The base game itself is good enough in my mind, for when you are of mood.  It's probably the first pick-up-and-deliver game, and it might be the best.

Rating based on FFG 2nd edition rules.

Absolutely torturous game. 30 rounds of monotony you will wish you had never sat through. Luckily we decided to call it quits at 16. The epitome of multiplayer-solitaire. We actually walked away from the table when it wasn't our turn. All you do is roll dice to determine which direction and how far you can move (which becomes frustrating as hell when you don't get the right number to go where you want to go), do random tests, draw random event cards and try to buy goods to sell or wait for passengers to magically fall into your lap. Painful. Plenty of better pick-up and deliver games available out there today.

I consider this the second true pick up and deliver game I've played after Kings of Air and Steam.  In my comments for that game, which I also enjoyed, I said that most pick up and deliver games turn me off by how dry and mathematical they seem (you know the ones, with the trains...it's always trains).

Merchant of Venus is nothing like that.  We are still picking up goods and delivering them but there is also intergalactic discovery, upgrading your ships with alien technology, and fighting pirates.  This game is not dry at all and I loved the variety and the thematic joy the game gave me while still also just trying to make sound economic deliveries to get more money than my opponents.

Now, I've had this game for close to 6 months before I got it to the table and that's mostly because of the time requirement.  My first game of this was with 3 people and it took just under 4 hours.  Granted that was with setup of which there is a lot and a complete read-through of the rules since none of us were familiar with it.  Actual gameplay with 3 was probably closer to 3 hours or maybe a little bit under.  This is because the game lasts 30 turns so you figure with 3 people an average turn of 2 minutes per player adds up to 3 hours and that sounds about right.  Sometimes a player will get a bad movement roll and not do much on his turn and be done in 20 seconds.  Sometimes, especially during the last 3rd of the game, players may need to analyze their decisions a little bit more to finish strong and take closer to 5 minutes to finish out a turn.  With a serious group though AP shouldn't be a huge problem because the status of the board changes little between player turns so most of your turn should be planned out before you actually take action.

Now, I should point out all these comments relate to the standard second edition rules set and there are things about this game that aren't for everyone.  Most pick up and deliver games have very defined mathematical boundaries while this game has a healthy dose of chaos.  Movement is dice-roll based as are all the checks and several other effects in the game and missions and rewards are based on deck draws so sometimes a player will get an achievable mission one move away while another will get an unachievable one on the other side of the board.  This really is about tactical and strategic gameplay and managing that chaos.

One of my opponents in the first game became quite upset when I beat him because of a doubles roll on fuzzy dice which doubles the amount of credits I received from fame from 10c to 20c.  I should point out though that I knew I was behind this opponent and planned around this item as a Hail Mary to win.  I purposely accumulated as much fame as possible since I couldn't compete with this player's efficient taxi and goods delivery engine.  I ended the game with between 50-60 fame so yeah, the lucky doubles amounted to a 500-600c gain but I still only beat this player by 300c and he finished the game with 20 infamy robbing him of 200c AND he had fuzzy dice as well but failed to roll doubles.

The classic game doesn't really interest me.  I've heard it is shorter but that is mostly because the end condition is based on a player receiving a certain amount of money, not a turn number.  I tend to prefer games with turns over point goals because with turns you can plan your strategy better and a lucky turn by one player can more easily be overcome by others.  Whereas with a point total the number of turns is variable and sometimes the first player to get a lucky turn can win just because of that.  But really the reason I don't want to play the classic game is a lot of the variability is lost with the random hazards and alien technology.  It sounds to me like the classic game is much closer to those dry pick up and deliver games I tend to avoid.

The volume of my comments and how much I defend criticisms toward this game should show how much I really enjoyed it but alas I'm not sure I'll be able to hold onto it.  At 2.5-3.5 hours for a 3-4 player game (that's where I put game time now knowing the rules and if it is setup ahead of time) I don't think my usual game group, which really only runs close to 4 hours, will be interested in too many plays.  There's a reason it took 6 months to get it to the table and that was for an impromptu Saturday gaming session, not my usual weekday gaming evening.

Merchant of Venus is a more than decent game about Space Exploration andtrading amongst different alien races. Each player takes Control of his og her own spaceship. By using Three (sometimes more) dice, players are then rolling and moving through the Galaxy in order to Discover New alien cultures, and trade their wares With other alien cultures. 

While the roll- and move mechanic may sound outdated, it should be said that in this game, it Works. It's actually fun! Furthermore, both art work and Components quality ishigh (typical FFG standard). However, the game is a pretty long one (3 - 4 hours), and it feels more than just a little too long for what it has to offer. There is quite a lot of randomness going on (both with regards to roll- and move and random events that may appear) and player interaction is kept to a minimum.  

All in all, while the game is not a great one, it is definitly better than mediocre.

[b]Classic Game[/b]

Good pick-up-and-deliver game with a nice arc to it, progressing from exploration (finding where the cultures are!), to small trades, and then on to immensely profitable runs.

The theme is great; the humour in the flavour text is a particularly entertaining touch (thank goodness Fantasy Flight did not make it Deadly Serious Merchants of Twilight Imperium). The components are top-notch.

It's clear that a range of strategies is possible, and while the dice can be vexing, they tend not to feel capricious: mitigating their effects is simply part of the overall optimization puzzle.

Excellent, though downtime is perhaps excessive with four.

I know it's basically a pick up and deliver game but it's still fun to me.  I like the theme a lot and the board is very pleasing to look at.  There is a little bit of strategy in whether you pursue upgrades scattered throughout the galaxy first and then go for earning cash or immediately try to start earning cash to get a jump on everybody else.  I prefer to play with the standard rule set ported from the original Avalon Hill edition.  I have not played with the new rule set introduced in this edition but after reading it over (and talking with others who have played it) I don't think it is a good way to play the game.

Amazing game of pick up and deliver.  It's mostly multi-player solitaire but it's a fun race to see who can do what.  I love the market tiles in the FFG version.

Great fun 2 player and 3 player, if lengthy.  Our 2 player games=3 hours, 3 player games last 4.5 hours.

Great components, great fun adventure!.  Only played Standard rules.  Although it is long, its one of those games you think about after youve played, it is fun and immersive, a experience game. And i like those!.

Havent played the classic game, but i dont think id want to after playing standard.  I like all the extra stuff in standard.

Regarding Fuzzy dice we just double the fame of the dice(if you roll doubles), NOT the total fame.

I have a couple of variants avail in the Variants section.  One for a simple Player vs player Combat option and another Merchant Ship Variant that uses some of the classic edition (included) components.

A classic FFG update to a classic Ameri-trash pick up and deliver game. It was fun, but the dice can make your turn a "nothing turn" and then there can be a wait while other players complete their turn. Also, the game feels too long. Four hours for a three player game - about 90 minutes more than it needed to be.

When Fantasy Flight re-released Merchant of Venus, I was quite happy. Finally, the game would get a wider distribution, and I'd be able to play with more people. Little did I know they'd actually release two versions of the game: what they now call the "Standard" version (which is actually, in my opinion a completely new game) and the "Classic" version (which is almost but not quite the same as the Avalon Hill original). This review is only for the Standard version.

The bottom line is that I'm glad I played the Standard game, if for no other reason than to satisfy my curiosity. I have been playing the AH version of the game for years. I consider it a tight engine, spruced up with some fun flavor text, and a bit rough around the edges (but in a charming way). If you are going to play Merchant of Venus, I can now confidently say that you should skip the new Standard game. Go right to the Classic game.

Overall, I'm very happy to see Merchant of Venus re-released. I'm happy that Fantasy Flight upgraded the components and included the double-sided board so that fans like me could play the Classic game with new players. However, the Standard game has some major problems. Depending on what you want out of your gaming experience, you may not consider these things "problems." I do.

First, FF gutted a lot of what made the original game streamlined and, in my opinion, fun. The trade-route building game is no longer really there in its original form. Now, the game is much more about thematic experience, lucky dice rolls, missions, rewards, and lots and lots of chrome. Yes, there is still trading. But the trading has been de-emphasized by FF's choice to include a ton of extra stuff piled on top of, or sometimes in place of, the original mechanics. For example, there are no demand tokens, no cup to replenish goods, and no factory goods. Despite these deletions, there are lasers, pirates, missions, fame, infamy, and reward cards. The list goes on. Why? Because it would seem that FF's general philosophy is that more is always better.

Second, my biggest complaint is that the game is now heavily luck dependent. Don't expect to have a lot of long-term control in the game. Just enjoy making a few tactical decisions each turn while the thematic cards and events wash over you. Yes, there was luck in the original game, but that luck was limited to movement rolls, asteroids, and the initial placement of races. Each of these areas was a known entity, and could be mitigated by smart play. Your ability to mitigate bad luck in the new FF version is minimal. The space pirates are especially frustrating in my opinion.

I can't say that I had a "bad" time playing the new Standard game. There was enough of a feel of Merchant of Venus to get me through. But this is not a game I wish to play again. It emphasizes completely different game-play priorities, and they are not what I want from my gaming experience. Heavily thematic FF games are among my least favorites boardgames, and in the case of Merchant of Venus, it would seem that FF chose to remake the game in its own image. No thank you.

The many intricacies of gameplay means it will likely take more than one play to fully comprehend all aspects of the game. A "brain-burner", this game is for gamers only, in my opinion. As a general rule I enjoy pick-up-and-deliver games, but I don't find space or alien themes to be up my alley. I also find the luck factor to be too high for the time commitment and mental engagement required. Thus, this game garners a below average rating from me for those two reasons. 

Update: I had rated this game a 6 after my initial introduction to the game several months ago, and thought perhaps my rating would go up with additional plays after I became more familiar with gameplay. However, after my second play I now doubt this will be the case, as I have further reduced my rating due to the reasons outlined below.

-Overall gameplay is largely dependent on luck, in the form of navigation. I don’t mind this for games like King of Tokyo, which provide a light, enjoyable experience. However, MoV requires high levels of mental engagement and time commitment, yet still relies rather heavily on chance. While there are certainly elements of the game where the effects of luck can be somewhat mitigated (drive upgrades, various technologies), navigation is still highly reliant on the result of die-rolls and directly affects how many cargo deliveries can be made per player. This results in a game which, for my tastes, relies on too much chance in relation to the amount of time commitment and mental engagement required.
-Most of the bits are fairly small in size but also contain a large amount of both information and iconography, making it difficult to locate the desired information during gameplay. Notably, this makes it difficult to identify the location of the various numbered cultures, once they have been discovered. This makes navigational planning very difficult. This could perhaps be resolved by incorporating some form of more easily identifiable flag to represent said locations.
-The game is extremely “fiddly”, with large amounts of bits to organize / manage / comprehend.
-The game requires extensive setup (30+ minutes).
-Lack of a way for players to track distance traveled during the course of a turn. This would be helpful as there are many interruptions to movement during the course of a turn, such as pilot, shield, and laser checks, encounters, and pirates. These all require additional die rolls or card draws, after which it is sometimes difficult to remember previous distance traveled and remaining movement available. Player aids similar to those available for Tikal would be helpful, though they would require even more table space and would likely add even more to the “cluttered” feel of the game. 
-Sci-fi theme isn’t my favorite.

In summation, I probably won't volunteer to play this game again in future unless we can add custom markers to gameplay to make the locations of the various cultures much easier to locate upon a visual scan of the board. I think markers of this type would make the navigation planning stage of the game much easier and will speed up gameplay.

Overall this is a slight improvement over the original IMO, as the added equipment, rewards, and encounters provide a richer experience. The added variety does increase the play time some as more options must be weighed, overwhelming the streamlining that was done to the original by removing the fiddly process of selling goods and distributing demands and replacement goods. Play this one when you are not in a hurry- relax and enjoy the experience.

About [thing=131646][/thing] for the [b]classic game[/b]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
Is the essence of pick and delivery game, with a racing aspect (the first to X money). This mechanic counts for around 85% of the game, with the remaining 15% being exploration, ships upgrades, finding planets and revealing obscure points of the cosmos, building spaceports and factories, etc. And you will be bound to take goods and passengers from point A to point B for a long time, as the playing time clocks around 3 hours.

Therefore, the game is all about finding the best routes, trying to take the best deals, and make every stop counts towards the final goal.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
At first the board starts with all the planets in need to be explored - no one knows, beforehand, which place sell what and where to sell stuff - not even the home planets for the races of the players. In the turn the player can: move (by rolling 2 to 4 dice, depending on the type of ship) and if she manage, stop in a planet or trading post. In the planet - or trading post - the player can sell 1 good and buy 1 good. Buing for ship upgrades and building spaceports and factories count as a buy, therefore you can't build a spaceport and buy an upgrade or a good of the planet in the same turn.

 If the player builds or uses the spaceport of someone else, there is not limit to the amount of goods sold and bought - the player owning the post gets 10% of the amount of money spent and gained (this applies even if the spaceport is yours!).

Some races have science that allow the player to not only buy goods, but also purchase upgrades for the spaceship - these are shields, drives, and in some the possibility of changing your ship type for another - there are 4 types:
- Scout: the starting ship. Hold: 2 goods. Movement: 3 dice;
- Clipper: faster ship. Hold: 2 goods. Movement: 4 dice;
- Transport: balanced. Hold: 3 goods. Movement: 3 dice;
- Freighter: lots of space. Hold: 4 goods. Movement: 2 dice.

During the game, players will keep buying and selling goods, trying to attend to the demands of the planets, which make produts sell for a higher price. This requires a good amount of route planning, not only the starting and final destination, but everything in between, as, except with a Clipper with a combo drive, travel will usually demand a few stops along the way. So, even if you are in planet 4, which sells something that planet 11 wants, oh so badly, is probable that you might need to stop at planet 14 along the way. Maybe is best to take only one good from planet 4, and another in planet 14, this one not to sell in 11, but next to 11 is planet 3, and you can then sell that there, while taking its good to sell in... and so on.

The game will proceed until one player reaches a certain amount of money. When this happens, the game is over and the player wins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What to buy and where to go. This isn't a difficult game to grasp at all. It do requires some vision not only to see what you will buy/sell next, but also your next step from there, and even the next after the next. This, of course, is if you want to play well. Otherwise, you can just live in the moment - hoping for some luck in the demands of the planets and/or in the appearance of passengers.

When and where to build spaceports (more than factories) can also serve the players well.

There are some tatical decisions during play, but most serve in a long term aspect, specially when considering the ship upgrades, as, from my experience, games are less decided by which type of goods you buy/sell, and more because of the fine tunning of the spaceship doing the job. You might want a fast Clipper, with a drive, in order to sail across the board in a blur of movement, trying to take all the highest demands before the others. Or you might want a slow and steady approach with a Freighter, carrying loads of goods to make fewer travels, but gaining time building (or using) spaceports to make several transactions at once. Or you might prefer the more balance Transport. Either way, though opportunity still plays its part, the ships is that most likely will make the players game.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Straightforward mechanic, without several mini-games built in;
- Both strategic and tatical, with long-term decisions and the ability to see and use the best opportunities that appears along the way;
- The gameplay is smooth, almost relaxing, as once the board is fully opened, there is little surprises and no agression between players; 
- Random set up makes the replay higher.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Long playing time: this isn't always a bad thing, but in a game in which players do the same thing over and over, I prefer a shorter playing time, as it can get dull fast;
- Luck of the dice: movement is made by rolling dice, and you might not be able to reach your intended destination, as fast as you wanted, because of them;
- Luck of the draw: the demand of the planets (which make goods more valuable) and passengers are drawn, randomly, from a bag. This can make a passenger just appear in the planet you are, or a demand appear in the planet you are going, making you gain more money just by pure luck;
- Low player interaction: though there is the possibility of trading between players, this will seldom happen, as if you have a good, you already have a destination for it (and you are probably in the way to there), so usually there is little reason to make trades. Other than this, the interaction is all indirect: someone delivers a good, fulfilling a demand, before you, or you use the spaceport built by someone else;
- Runaway leader: with little interaction, and no risk in sells, is possible that a player, with some luck, can pull away and open a big lead. There is little to be done, except hope for Lady Luck prefer you, or that mistakes are made.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like being in the easiest job done by Serenity. In Merchant of Venus there are no risks, except for a few unkown spots in the route, but even the nastier one (a cost 40 to pass) will only stop you, if you can't pay.

There is a lack of excitement in the gameplay. There are no high risk with high reward deliveries. No devious passenger that pays a lot, but might put you in trouble. No unstable good that can blow you ship, that cost cheap and sell for a lot in the right places. Though there is an asteroid field on the board, deliveries to or from there pay nothing more than other places.

Players do the same thing over and over and over again, with the full knowledge that they will deliverthe goods and be paid. This makes for a lackluster experience and helps in the runaway leader problem - if someone is leading, you might want to go all in and accept a highly dangerous delivery in a killer route - you might  fail, but, if you don't, you could turn the game around. No. The highest paying good might be right beside the consuming planet, connected by the smoothest of the routes.

Merchant of Venus is simply left in the finest dust by [thing=138161][/thing] , as, for me, is a much better game, with more options, more to do, more excitement and in about the same amount of time or less.

Still, Merchant of Venus offers a pure pick and delivery experience, is easy to teach and play to the point of being relaxing, just listen to the space radio while the spaceship, in autopilot, sails the in between the systems. Overall, the low confrontation and low complexity of Merchant of Venus can (and, for quite a while already, do) appeal to many players.

So far it's ranked a 7.5, but that's only after a 3 or 4 two player games with the Classic Rules.  We started with the Classic Rules simply because the rule book was shorter.  lol
Very interested in seeing where the 2nd Edition rules take the game.

Got to play at ConnCON 2013 in Stamford. I got off to a bad start, which effected my experience well into the game, but ultimately got a really good feel for the game, and found I like it a lot! I can't wait to play it again, and will play it very differently the next time. I want to play 1st edition now, also.

Not a bad game if you don't mind the old style, roll and move mechanic.  The best thing about this game is the humorous names of tradable items and the descriptions of the races.

My wife and I may be the only two people in the world who prefer the FFG update to the classic game, but both are pretty damn good. Super fun exploration element. Insane amount of stuff in the box.

I think that Classic is better than Standard and there's a definite sense of exploration. After 2 games of this, it feels very static since the map doesn't change at all.

It's okay, but for the length, I think there are better experiences out there. There may not be better equivalent experiences out there, but just there are so many quality board games, this one definitely feels dated to me. 2 games in and I've had my fill.

Played the "new" version, having never played the old one. It was very enjoyable and seemed to play faster that the 3.5 hours it actually took to play.

RATING: 9
Seems fun; pick up and deliver mostly with a twist; different set up of pieces every time for the discovered worlds keeps the game fresh and changing; luck of the dice rolls are mitigated with prospecting and trading/selling of goods, mixed with a small tech tree for your ship improvements -- not bad at all; race to see who can reach the pre-set cash goal the fastest!

Only played once.  I really enjoyed the first exploration phase, and it was a fun degree of action efficiency.  It did feel like it dragged a lot the second half, likely because it was at 5 players.  Rating would likely shift after more plays

The game left me wanting to play it again, which is good. It felt like an adventure playing it, so in that way it was good. But on the other hand it felt very random as well with most of the game success boiling down to the roll of the dice.

This game feels like it could have been designed this past year, rather than a remake of a 1988 title.  The game is charming, particularly the goods and the different alien races.  The mechanics are pretty clean, and the basic pick-up-and-deliver gameplay makes intuitive sense.  There's a bit of 1980s cruft hanging around on the framework, but largely it's pushed into the background.  It is among the best pickup and deliver games, along with [gameid=168] and the rest of the crayon rail series.

All that said, It's still far from perfect.  The game takes a long time, especially when you add setup time, rules explanation, and teardown.  The wrong group can push the game into the 3-5 hour range, which is much too long for the caliber of gameplay.  The expansion phase has a tendency to become a bit of a slog, as you keep hoping that the next place will want to buy the goods your ship is carrying.  The board state changes enough that long-term strategy is difficult to plan, and players will often have to rethink their turns on their turn, slowing down the experience.  

The Classic Version is definitely the better ruleset if you're wondering which to play.  The FFG dolled-up Standard Version has filed away some of the rough edges of the original, but unfortunately it's added on some other unnecessary cruft as well.  There's even more randomness tacked on, and the game has a tendency to have an even worse runaway leader problem, as things like lucky market timing or good early discoveries can make a leader impossible to catch.  The 30 rounds that it takes is often much longer than the number of rounds to finish the standard game.  Finally, the addition of missions, pirates, and different ship construction serves to add more mechanics and things to track, which is mostly a distraction from the game's strongest points.  The Classic Version is far from perfect, but it's better-balanced, shorter, and less fiddly than the reimplementation.

RATING: N/A
This was ok, but like most big box Fantasy Flight games, simply too long and fiddly. After rolling the dice, we were repeatedly counting up various possibilities "ok, I could move along here 1-2-3-4...12, so I could reach this, but I would have to deal with this pirate and I'm not sure I could do that, maybe I should try this route instead..." Lots of time taken doing that it seemed, and it was very easy to miscount or lose track. Then lots of busy work putting out new passengers rotating through the goods when buying or selling, taking your cash for discovering, and so forth. Individually it all seems easy, but it was just taking way too long.

We played the Standard game, and definitely should have had some sort of accelerated start. At the beginning of the game there was nowhere specific to go, and nowhere to deliver because you hadn't found race 4,5,6 or 7 yet, etc. So it also took a long time to develop anything fun. The random event cards were really frustrating as well, it seemed like every one stopped us in our tracks or was negative in some fashion.

I'm glad I played it once, but it cured my desire of owning it.

Perry Rhodan (the two-player pick-up and deliver game) stretched out into a multi-hour chit-fest. Better than most epic Fantasy Flight titles.

As this was a grail game, I expected it to be good. I guess it might have been if you were a bored teenage boy with an interest in business, before the age of video games.

Besides the randomness of the roll-and-move dice mechanic and it's seemingly simple nature, this game is deceivingly tactical and requires some keen planning. The components and board of the new FFG-edition are pretty and of a very high quality, making it a joy to behold.
The game itself is pouring with theme and really feels like exploring Merchant Space. Works best with some amounts of alcohol.

The new "standard" rules -while appearing really interesting- are a dud though.. Better stick with the classic 1988 rules.

The classic game seemed too simple for my thematic tastes and the standard game was just a train wreck of fiddly token shuffling and what seemed to be an incredibly long play time. I wanted to love it, I really, really, did...but not once did we play a game where someone wasn't clock watching waiting for it to end. It was random in all the wrong places and predictable every where else. I think Fantasy Flight usually does a bang-up job of remaking and modernizing games, but in my group this one was a colossal flop.

Wanna play it first before buying.  After watching the preview/review, the length seems like a real issue.

Might not even buy it after all.  Kind of annoyed that it dropped off the map all because a bunch of groggy grognads hated the idea of FFG reprinting it.

Unfortunately too long, but that could probably be treated fairly easily. The theme of supply and demand, combined with the types of goods offer so much hilarity, there needs to be a better way to compact it in an accessible time-frame.

Nice to get the new "Standard" version and the rules for the classic version in the same box.  Fantastic FFG components.  I have the old AH version as well and this one blows it away.  The new standard seems a bit more streamlined in play and reduces the number of players from 6 to 4 which is probably a good thing in terms of downtime and game length (which will still take in the 180+ range).

Definitely play with 3, not 4.  4 doesn't really add anything to the game except time.

Also, with 4, last few turns seemed anticlimactic, as the goods had exhausted themselves.

RATING: 5.5
the basic idea of the game isn't that bad but it turns out terribly slow and repetitive. You are always doing the same thing mechanically over and over again. Of course there are so many games where you are doing the same thing over and over again but in a game like this it does seem a constraint. You are going into loops taking from "civilization number 5 to civilization number 8". It's an excercise in graph theory.
the economic engine at the beginning is also very very slow and it feels like it takes ages to start ding smthing meaningful.

boring.

A long game, but a fantastic one. I love having the ability to go around, upgrade your ship, buy and sell goods, establish spaceports, and everything else in this game. It reminds me of a non-violent Merchants & Marauders, which is probably why I like it so much.

Roll and move galaxy exploration. Discover new worlds and make first contact with new alien races, trade goods and upgrade your ships and avoid hazards. I like the demand system drawing and returning from draw pile. Reminds of Privateer. My wife will like this one if she can get passed the nav system (might have a house rule to scrap the nav die). Long game could be adjusted by lowering dollar target.

HUGE THANK YOU to my husband's (redbear) beautiful Secret Santa 2012! 

I really like the pick-up and deliver/economics set in the alien/space theme. The mechanisms of the game could have been themed in other ways, but the alien/space theme allows for creative items, fun with words, and all sorts of silly frivolities to enter into the game, lifting it above the base economic and territorial mechanisms that this game employs...in a very satisfying way.

I have only played the Fantasy Flight/Stronghold re-release of the 'original' version, which we are happy with. I do not foresee 'erasing' this game from our game registrar.

Of all the games that I traded away, this is probably the one that makes me the saddest. The toy effect on this one just hits the roof!
However, I had it for more than a year and it was was one of the games that I always thought "I'll never gonna get it to table, being a 2 or 3h game of pickup and delivery space game." I know, that's what's it is, but the theme is not the most attractive to some of the people that I play with. And the worse was just to get it up and running, that's a full afternoon business! 1 or 2 hours for teaching it! Nah, That made it impossible.

FFG has found the sweet spot for a Euro-Ameritrash hybrid - a thematic game with many choices and strategies.  While the new rules add some randomness, complexity, and make it longer, they do add to the theme.  My rating would have been higher if the card text would have been more creative - several are a bit boring and it is a missed opportunity.  The quality of the components is very good as would be expected.  The rulebook was actually pretty good with only a few forum checks required to get clarifications.  If nothing else, I now have a copy of MofV whereas I probably never would have paid the $$ to get a copy of the original.

the game is solid enough, it's just too long for what it is.  Cut out about 5-10 rounds and it'd be perfect, save the 30 rounds for a convention or something.  Of course you can do this yourself as houseruling.

After one play:  LOOOONG, but fun.  If you don't have a minimum of 3 hours, don't try.  And that's 3 player.  4 player would probably be a minimum of 4.  This is an old school grind game.  I don't have a basis from the first edition so can make no comparison, but I did genuinely enjoy myself.

Have now played both the classic and the new "standard" versions of the game.  Liked the standard version much much better.

Trader is an extremely simple game in terms of mechanics: buy a card or sell a pair of them are your only options.  Of course, you don't want to be buying if that would reveal a valuable card for your opponent.  Early in the game money is also a constraint - you may find yourself obliged to sell when what you'd prefer to do is build a higher value pair.  The four-player partnership game adds concerns about your partner's cash.  Nice.

I like the Cocktail Games tins and the cards in them are good quality.  The money cards in Trader are nicely done, I wasn't so impressed by the share cards, but at least they are entirely functional, even for the colour-blind.

I knew as soon as I saw this that it would be right up my street. I bought it mainly for the 2v2 partnership. It has very simple rules, two choices each turn, buy or sell. From that though come some very interesting choices. A card game with no luck and a decent ability to look a head. 

The whole board is set out at the beginning so from the off you can begin to make plans for the game. A random board every game will give Trader some decent replayability.

I actually like this as a partnership exercise.  I could see that it could be frustrating though to play with someone who wasn't paying attention or wasn't entirely aware of how the game worked.   It's the sort of game where a single error can doom you, so efficient team play is key.

Very quick filler that is more about color recognition and multiplication of single-digit integers than it is about stock market transactions.   The partnership aspect is nice and works well.

A reasonably interesting filler that works well with 3P and 4P as teams (the main attraction here). There are five rows of 7 overlapped colored/numbered cards. Each turn you can either buy one of the cards on the bottom of each row OR sell two cards of the same color. If you sell, say, a green 3 and a green 5, you get the product (15). It sounds simple, and it is, but the decisions are fun because you frequently don't want to buy a card on your turn because there's a higher card (like a 6) that would be freed up for your opponent to buy. So the game is as much or more about what card you will free up than what card you should purchase. 

In team play, when a team wants to sell, each player must supply one of the cards, so the challenge is to navigate those decisions in tandem. The cooperative card play is pretty unique in this regard. In the 3P game, there’s a “Market Closed” card which you get to place after your turn and block the next player from purchasing one card. Some turns may be obvious, but others offer interesting decisions as which card to entice another player with such that they free up the card you want. 

I couldn’t locate a copy in the US, but during a trip to Belgium, I had an Outpost shop order it for me and send it to me. I paid the guy cash in his shop and told him I’d email him my address when I got home. Of course I got the game with no problems, and I enjoyed the quaintness of such an old-fashioned transaction.

Good game for the price I paid (3 €), to spend some minutes without thinking so much. It seems a solitarie with two, you must choose the card is better for you trying to avoid that your opponent get a good card too.

Lack of availability makes the price high for what it is - it's the type of game you should just make up with a deck of cards and monopoly money.  That aside, there are some interesting decisions to be made in the 4er game, but it's quite chaotic and made for a frustrating and aggravating experience in my 5-6 plays last night.  I'll try it again but it's not really high on my list.

This is Combit/Ka-Ching re-done as a partnership game for four players.  Playing in partnership adds an interesting additional level to the game - and this is a game that probably needed an additional level.  You're much more restricted in what you can do, since (1) all sales must involve one of your cards and one of your partner's, and (2) there are now two people on your team that have to worry about running out of cash, since the person who sells can't share the proceeds with their partner.

The partnership version helps take away some of the zero-sum, stalemate-y feeling of the two-player version.  Trader is also more attractively presented than previous editions.  It also includes rules for two and for three players.

The bottom line is that I traded away Combit, but Trader is enough of an improvement that I'll definitely buy it.  For reference, I rate Combit a 6.

This game hit me totally by surprise.  I understand it to be Combit with partners.  Fast playing, with agonizing decisions, all the while coordinating with a partner.  Really good stuff.

RATING: 7
A very simple change - making Combit/Ka-Ching into a partnership game - was a great idea.  The game is much more interesting that way.  It is particularly fulfilling (and frustrating) when your partner makes the right (or wrong) move.

Petit jeu simple et rapide, un bon filler. Devrait sortir plus souvent :).Juste essayé à 2, et c'est la configuration idéale, afin de prendre la bonne carte, tout en laissant un choix pas trop bon à l'adversaire, vendre au bon moment...

Based on one play: In teams the game is slightly interesting, especially if you make all the communication silent. But otherwise, I can't imagine it being fun as there is not much to it. Buy a card, block a row of cards and then sell two cards on your turn, that's all. In teams, you must sell one from each play (always of the same color) thus the column you block is important since the next player (an opponent) cannot re-block the same row. But even at four it is not much fun.

Very simple, very clever. I especially like the 4-player game, 2 against 2. 2-player game is ok, 3-player game rather looks like a quick variant pulled together in order to print "2-4 players" on the box instead of "2 and 4 players"...

Rating based on fantastic four-player partnership version, which requires careful look-ahead planning. Even though it is an entirely "open information" game, there are times when deducing the "obvious"  move is not straight-forward, but the game doesn't seem to invoke AP.

Cool simple game. Played it with 3 players and liked it. It's very difficult to control evcery aspect on the game but I guess that with experienced players (all of them) this could be a good medium weight short game.

[Cocktail 2009 edition] {trading; card-drafting, partnership; optimal 2/4p} When I have Combit, buying this game seems a waste of money; however, I still bought this game for its nicer illustration and additional rules/cards for 3/4p games.  (It's easy for owner of Combit / Ka-Ching to create a DIY 3/4p version.)

The game is as elegant and nice as the original game.  I particularly enjoy the 4p-partnership game, which is very fun.  I prefer communication is not allowed between players.

I love Combit / Trader!

New 2-4 player retread of the old 2-player game Combit / Ka-Ching. Quality cards, quality art, nice tin. The (original) 2-player game is good, the 3-player version with the moving "closed market" is better, and the 4-player partnership version is even better.

Rating based on the 4-player game; with 2/3 I'd rate it an 8.

Trader is a great little game with very simple rules.  I like the choice between buying cards or selling cards.  I think it really works nicely for two, but is likely better with 3 or even 4.  I'd like to get this game as a quick filler.

Played once.  A clever little card game where you buy low and sell high.  On your turn you can buy ONE card from the bottom of an open row for $ equal to its value or you can sell TWO cards in the same color for $ equal to the multiple of the two values.

eg.  buy a 2 and a 3, total cost 5, sell for 6.
eg. buy a 5 and a 6, total cost 11, sell for 30.

The game ends when 3 rows of cards are empty.

Running out of money is bad because your opponent can buy two cards at the same time, digging down into a row to a big card they need.  Lots of fun trying to maximize your profits.  There's also an odd number of cards in each color so you can get left with stuff you can't sell. 2009/07/16

It's a decent game, but there's so little that's going on (and the 2-player game is soooo scripted) that I don't see myself playing this again unless someone really wants to get it to the table.
This is the sort of design I would never have sent to a publisher: it just doesn't feel finished.

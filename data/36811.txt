PoMP is a bitter higher on the complexity scale than Hamburgum... at least the decisions are perhaps a little less obvious. I enjoyed my initial learning game, but I think all the players felt that we didn't really get it until the end, when it was too late. I do believe there are a number of strategies to employ, which really makes me ready to play again. And the theme is fantastic... I loved my trip to Machu Picchu and am quite happy to remember it while playing this game. I hope I can bring this to the table again soon.

Didn't really enjoy my first game - apart from the dual ending themes, it just felt like a generic euro.  Moving your piece around the board felt like a frustrating chore.  Want to play it again before I make my mind up.

Played at Essen - at first a confusing game - so many options - simplifies rapidly as you enter the cycle of obtaining resources, trading and spending resources so well-known of the Rondel games - but with  a difference since the effective rondel formed by the different areas you can move into is mixed up quite well, and you can cross from one place to many others.
The starters game encourages a Machu Picchu victory which is not a good reflection of the real game, I suspect, (where a Spanish Victory would be more likelyt than it was) but it was very enjoyable with a close finish.
Edit: in fact at Essen we played it wrong, thinking you could trigger production or sacrifices more than once a day which is incorrect! So we all had far too much resources! Played again, and was also still very enjoyable, altho not all the group were convinced - needs to be played again.
Edit: gaming group didn't like it, finding it over complicated and not liking the fact that points are not visible until the end. I still like it though!

RATING: 7
An interesting game.  Pseudo-worker placement with resource collection, a market and some other unique things thrown in.  I like the possibility for different endings that entail different scoring.  I also like how players have to balance resource production against climbing up the mountain for cards (which enable VP accumulation).

I once won on a Spaniard ending when I would have come in last on an Incan ending.  Kinda cool.

While minorly complex, the game is not terribly deep.  Plenty of choices, but they don't lead to dramatic divergence.  I don't get the sense that there's a lot going on or too much more for me to figure out.  Doesn't hook me.

Excellent bits, though.  And llamas.  LLAMAS!!!  (Though the llamas are sacrificed by the priests and virgins...)

RATING: 6.5
This could have been so much more beautiful!
And (despite winning)I may agree with David about point tripling being a tad too strong.
I'm thinking multiples like +60%, +40%, +20%, +10% for respective place in gold totals.

Update: We played with just adding the gold to other scores. seemed to be balanced.

RATING: 4.5
The board is hideous. I love how some have tried to defend the game in spite of the board; look, the board is part of the game; if it sucks then the game comes closer to sucking as a result. The sun dial mechanism at the end seems to let everyone think "oh crap, I didn't properly anticipate the endgame, so I'll just throw all my stuff in the crapper at the last minute and get the stuff that REALLY does matter in scoring". Yuck.

First play with two.  We activated all the priests and virgins in time but forgot to finish immediately and decided to play to the final phase.  Much to think about.  Nice theme.  Not fond of the board artwork but got used to it.  Will happily play again.

Second play with 5.  Engrossing.  I lost due to a careless last move which enabled the penultimate player on the last round to prevent the Spannish invasion.  A hard lesson.

An economic/resource management game. In comparison with other Gerdts games I was not satisfied. Overall though it is a nice game. Yes, I do wish for a less random delivery  of the scoring mechanism although as a scoring mechanic it is balanced. It could be the first artwork I see that uses live pictures next to sketches, and doesn't look that bad.

I have several issues about that game:
* Scoring is very confusing (partially set-collections multiplied with placed inkas) and not elegant at all.
* The Inka village - with all those vibrant colours overlapping each other it is surprisingly hard to evaluate board state and adjacent action spots
* Game is primarily a big resource conversion engine (not my taste)

Before that game I was interested in playing (and maybe even buying) Concordia. But as both games share this special style of scoring, my enthusiasm for Concordia plummeted...

1 play, non-Cortez ending.  Interesting set collection game.  I'm curious to see if the Cortez ending (2x or 3x scoring for the persons who collected the most gold) feels "broken" because that is the opinion of several of my friends.  Note to self: Get workers out early (especially a shirt guy) since it's hard to get cheap resources otherwise.  Also, focus on running up the mountain for extra VP cards... this will take llamas, priests & tactical plays.

Why oh why does this game not have more fans? The staffing requirements are confusing to teach, but they are balanced and perfect. The recruit vs. sacrifice actions are confusing to teach, but they are balanced and perfect. I love games that allow all players to benefit from a single player's action. You have to weigh the personal bonus against the position you give your opponents. Mac Gerdts is definitely my favorite game designer.

RATING: 7
Another Rondel game, but this time the rondel is the map - which is quite clever. There are cards for some needed randomness, and 2 routes to victory - either collect gold and priests (to get a spanish win and x3vp) or workers for a native win.

Problem for the priests is too many and the natives win anyway.

Main downside is the fiddly scoring at the end. Meeples are fun (although the t-shirts don't really fit the theme)

Overall, solid game but nothing remarkable. I'd trade for a copy and play it occassionally but no desire to buy it.

** Update, now traded for a copy, and played it more and like it more.

Quick start variant is good too for beginners. Certainly more here than first appears.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game is for me an evolution of hamburgum. It shares a lot of mechanism and brings some new elements (Inka-path).
It´s fine economic game, where you try to get VP driven by cards (which tell you what kind of workers and priests counts for yor). The number of workers are mutiplied with symbols of the offer cards. So you wander around on the map (similarities to the rondel are apparent), which could be designed nicer and clearer, collecting resources and buying workers/priests. The cards will be granted by climbing the 20 spaces long Inka-path. For every time you achieve the top/end you will get one card (Take three cards and discard any one card in your hand).
In the alternative ending (the spanish find Machu Picchu) the player with the most gold symbols (also found on the offer-cards) will triple his VP count, the second most doubled. The spanish will come at the end of round 9. So if the game takes longer the gold symbols are more important then the others. The duration of the game can be controlled by the players.
At all a very good eurogame.

The Princes of Machu Picchu is another take on the rondel mechanism. In this case, the different districts of the Inca city make up the rondel. As in other rondel games, players gather resources and then transform them into VP. What makes the game stand out, however, is the tension that comes from the two possible game end conditions, and that will pit players against each other.

Note that most players will probably not understand how all the mechanisms work together until they complete a whole game. This is a good game but will benefit greatly if all players know what they are doing. One of my favorite rondel games.

RATING: 7
The verdict is out. Will need replay. Making the scout to move up the mountain multiple times to get scoring cards seemed really difficult in a 5 player game.

Based on one play at Essen 2008.

Update: The second play was better. Was able to to summit the mountain 5 times. It's a decent resource gathering game. Nothing startling or new here, but quite playable.

RATING: 8
Enjoyed this game quite a bit.  The trade-off decisions between producing, buying priests, and sacrificing is not obvious. 

The spanish invasion element is also very interesting and gives players even further choices to make.  

I'd rate this game a 9, except that I really don't feel like playing it that often.   That may have to do with the fact that although it is a deep game, it does take a while to play and is mentally taxing.  I think my brain is at a point where it far prefers short and succinct games.

RATING: N/A
Interesting production engine game that requires some future planning and management of opponents' moves in order to do well.  I enjoy it, but it doesn't stand out to me as being an exceptional game.  The Spanish conquest is an interesting twist.  The 3x/2x/1x multiplier overrides everything if it happens, and it seems like it will happen more often than not - especially in a 2 or 3 player game.  I think more players may make the conquest/no conquest thing more relevant, but also adds to the downtime between turns - which can be significant sometimes because there is a lot you want to accomplish with only a limited number of turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very good first impression, with the 'whole board is a rondell' quips being spot on - a couple of things that escaped me when reading the rules (they are clearly spelt out there but you know how it is, some things only become clear when you play the game) were that each area of the board can only be activated once each day and that you can add a number of Incas to the board in a single turn - so long as they're in different places, but these became clear quite quickly.  My other misunderstandings only became clear at the end of the game - my fault for saying "it's OK, I've read the rules, let's just start" - I had multiple scoring cards for llamas plus an interest in pots and woven goods and had built up a big supply of goods - especially llamas - with the aim of sacrificing the surplus at the central temple - I was well ahead of the others on resources and the sacrifice should generate at least one extra score card from the Inca trail - I thought I looked good for a win.  There were three problems with this.  First, you can only sacrifice a maximum of one of each good at the central temple (darn).  Second, the player before me who'd been collecting moon tiles consistently all game swooped on the final priest card instead - ending the game instantly before I could even get to the temple, rather than taking a moon tile which would have given me an extra turn (dammit).  Third, well third was my complete misconception that you scored resources at the end - instead you score your Inca markers on the board - so my piles of goods were a complete waste of effort and the Inca I'd removed from the llama fields to the sun clock to generate some extra resources for my temple sacrifice was a particularly bad move (b*****).  Still, I enjoyed it despite that, I'm looking forward to playing again and I will know better next time.  I hope.  Quote of the game - "But I can't afford a puma - pause - I don't have enough T-shirts"!

There is no problem of the game to gather resources and place incan with using some specific trading mechanics.  However the scoring system ruined the game.  The game gets even worse if the game ends with the conquest by the Spanish. It doesn't make sense to use 2x and 3x mechanics to calculate the score.  Totally irrelevant to the theme of the game.  It also should be very hard to beat the player with most gold. Good components but the art design of the board should be much better!!
I love this theme so much, but the scoring system makes me stop thinking to buy this game.

From one play: This kinda follows the "I have no idea what I should do" theme that Mac Gerdts games usually result in for me on the first play. But I felt a little less excited about exploring the system than I did with Antike and Imperial (still haven't played Hamburgem as of this writing). A couple of the resources seemed to be completely interchangeable and thus not very interesting. The board is atrocious. And the end game scoring is completely wonky. I sort of feel like I understand the rules, and while I admit I don't have a good grasp on strategy, the bigger problem for me is I just don't feel like I know what the game is trying to do. And I don't really like how the (good) choices available to you get so constrained by what others do that it feels a little tactical. It's sort of interesting, and I would certainly give it the benefit of the doubt and play again, but not optimistic about my revised rating.

Only played this twice so far (3p both times) but I have to admit, it's my new infatuation.  We'll see if it can hold on to the 10.
There are so many things to manage that all feel well integrated to me.  The movement on the map, the interaction with the timing of the sacrifices, the management of resources, the recycling of the Incas (I'm still not sure the sun clock pays off, but the winner of both games used it a few times), the concentration of the Inca placement, and the potential tension of the two different endgame conditions (thereby resulting in different scoring modifiers), all add up to a great game.  
In both games it was not apparent at all who was going to win, and most of the moves on the last couple rounds were very tense.  It feels like there are important decisions to make the entire game and we have only scratched the surface of trying to "play defense".  There is so much going on that the first couple plays you pretty much only worry about yourself.
I'm optimistic it will hold on to the 10 rating!

The Princes of Machu Picchu played well with 2.  It seemed like it was a little long, but turns got shorter as we got a few rounds deep.  I like the scoring being secret until the end.  The scoring also was heavily influenced by the gold count.  I also liked the mini game with start player.  So...good solid game.  Nothing stands out as being clunky or broken.  Worth a play.  I think it would play well with any number of players.

An interesting game, given the variable ending VP mechanic. A good worker placement game, with some scarcity of resources but a way to manage it. No dice, which is also a plus, although the variable amounts of gold on the drawn sacrifice cards can change the game. I'm not too big a fan of the hidden objectives (sacrifice cards), since there is no way to predict what others need, but you can't really block other players anyway other than buying priests they need.

A solid game.   The dual ending scenarios spice it up, and can cause a race condition in the later turns, which is fun.  I think the game may be overly complex for what it is.

I definitely need to play again, because while I thought I understood when we started I clearly did not.  Even by the end, I had to see our scoring to understand fully how it worked (and even then a rule was discovered later that might have changed things).  There are some interesting things going on here, and a lot of questions of opportunity.  I really like the different end conditions causing a different scoring.  I feel like a player who needs one kind of end can try to push for it, to give him a better chance.  That's different.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after one play. Rating might go both ways depending on replayability of the game, most probably up though.

I liked it but as it seems now the Spaniards will often win which makes running up the mountain vital (and getting high value gold cards as well). Still an interesting game. I especially like the llamas. :)

Update: Much better on second playing. Tight race between the Spaniards and the Priests/Virgins which we didn't see last time. Game actually ended with a rescue this time.

RATING: 6
This game has great mechanics, it is fun to play, but the end fizzles out.  Something doesn't seem right with the scoring.  The triple for most gold is just too valuable.  Basically whoever gets that triple is going to win.  So then it comes down to card draw.  I find it strange how the game was really well done, but they missed the boat w/the scoring.  Reminds me of a TV series that was a lot of fun to watch, but they could never seem to wrap it up right...X-Files?

Another play hasn't changed my opinion.  The Spanish victory needs to be eliminated or fixed so that the swings aren't so enormous.  If a player had control over the victory condition, that would be better too.  But there are too many hawk/puma/virgins to buy for one player to have much effect by himself.  And if you don't draw 7's and 6's, forget winning.  This game is so close to being really good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good initial impressions. The Princes of Machu Picchu is one of the more innovative designs I have scene and firmly puts Mac Gerdts in the small category of "designers I keep an eye on."

The interesting balance between short term and long term investments as well as the threat of triple scoring from the conquistadors really makes this game feel like it has tons of potential ways it can play out. The presence of movement aspect to a resource gathering/management only makes the game more intriguing. 

It is unique enough to have a place in my collection.

Very good resource management game, with a spatial twist: to take an action, you need to move to it on the board. However, the scoring can be a bit random and the swing too wild depending on the type of ending.

Nice rondel-less rondel game.  Build an economic engine and let it run.  Nice.  Good length.

Needs a house rule to mitigate the power of the Spanish.  Tripling and doubling two players scores is just too much.

Jó hosszú szabálymagyarázat. Aztán hosszan is játék, persze kezdőkkel is. Ugyanakkor esélytelen volt, h az inkák győzzenek. Viszont az h a spanyolok: érdemben nem változtatta a sorrendet. Azaz ugyanaz maradt a pontsorrend a szorzás után. Maga a játék szép. Jól kidolgozott, ötletes. Sok kombinációs lehetőség, át kell látni.

I'm not a huge fan of the gold/spanish mechanic. It puts a huge variance on relatively small swings in a random quantity. You can control it somewhat through choosing which cards to keep, but getting cards which both go well together (ie, lots of the same symbols) and also have a decent amount of gold on them is nigh impossible. Otherwise, this game is pretty awesome.

It is soooo hard to explain this game as it has so many different parallel focal points. Plays very well when you just try it and play the first rounds, but it does tend to get pretty mechanical towards the end. Seems too long to keep the interest in it alive throughout the entire game, although there are changes in what you need to do to optimize your situation. I strongly believe this game can only be appreciated once you've played it more than just a few times - hoping you've played it all correctly. Although the rules are clear, you tend to make a mistake or two at first.

Time for something very unique.  It has various Euro mechanisms we've all seen before but twists them in interesting ways.  

First it's been described as a worker placement game.  Well, there are workers in the game and they do get placed to gather resources for their owners but people can do nothing to block people from getting the resources produced by their workers.  You do have one Prince piece which moves around the map and activates regions.  Some of the regions have incentives which go to the person that activates the region.  Once the regions with incentives are activated, they can't be activated again.  So I guess the Prince is more similar to the average worker in a worker placement game but when these regions with incentives are activated, every player has an opportunity to use that regions abilities if they have the pre-requisites (resources, workers, and/or priests/virgins).  It's almost like Puerto Rico role selection, except this selection is done by area movement similar to Risk and other territory games.

That's just the tip of the iceberg.  You have a resource market similar to Cuba but anytime the market is activated you can add or remove a resource from it before starting your exchanges which is as much selling and buying as you want.  These resources can be used to get currency, other resources, place workers, get priest/virgin tiles.  These tiles are the typical way for people to attain VP cards (a little similar to Stone Age VP cards except that no one can see what cards you get).  You're not completely thrown to the card randomness wolves either... when you get to draw VP cards you're allowed to draw three, combine with your hand of cards hand and the discard two... am I exploring in Race for the Galaxy?  The game feels like an an efficiency engine game because usually what you can accomplish will snowball as the game progresses but there are no auctions.

Rounds last a number of turns dictated by the players.  Some will want to end rounds early and some will try to make it last as long as possible based on how they want the game to end.  The game will end in one of two ways which have different scoring methods.

Even though some of the elements of this game are well known there are two outstanding mechanics that lift it up above the rest. One is the action space/free movement combination that makes one think where one actually places the action marker. And the other is the "race to the mountain" mechanic that is an all important (perhaps TOO important) way to maximize your points.

Mac Gerdts' area control games like Antike and Imperial came across as flawed but his effort at a worker placement game seems much better. No overt flaws here and a lot less deterministic. 

I like it that this game has a lot of uncertainty built into it. The leader is not clear and the victory conditions can swing depending on how the game turns out - either a Spanish win (which means get lots of gold) or the Incans win (which means have workers in the right place and having the right cards). Good thing that switching strategies halfway is not too painful here. Yet, players have, right of the bat, several broad strategies they can embark on.

Not sure if the theme works but frankly, some sort of theme will stick to any game about riding Ilamas and sacrificing virgins. This game is ripe with sexual innuendos!

RATING: 8
This is my favorite Gerdts game and one my group still enjoys nearly 10 years later. It’s definitely one of the most unique games you’ll play. Instead of moving around a rondel, the board itself is a quasi-rondel whereby you move to a space and take the action. Here’s the catch -- for most spaces only one player can take that action each day. Say what?

And this is where the fun begins. You put out workers in action spaces who get activated on other players’ turns to produce goods for yourself (think clients in Glory to Rome). You want to get a workforce out early so you can passively produce goods on other players’ turns while you run around the board using these resources to create more workers, make some money, and purchase priests and virgins. Say what?

The other part of the fun is trekking up Machu Picchu (something some friends of mine did recently and it sounds like a helluva thing). You need to visit your favorite priest or virgin and sacrifice some llamas so you can move your dude up the mountain (I just wrote that, it is accurate, but it sounds ridiculous). Your reward at the top is an endgame VP card. You desperately need endgame VP cards because they’re essentially all the points you’re going to get. After repeated plays I’ve come to value getting up that mountain more than a large workforce and tons of resources. Whoever gets up that mountain 6 times will probably win the game. Unless the Spanish show up and ruin everything. Say what?

The weakest part of the game by far is the scoring. There are two ways the game can end which affect how VPs are scored. Either MP is saved (VPs per usual) or the Spanish show up (VPs are tripled and doubled for two people whose VP cards have the most gold on them). You might finish 3rd with 15 points but have your score tripled to 45 and win. 

After several plays, we’re OK with this as we’re savvy enough to play for the endgame we prefer but I do wish Gerdts would update this game because the rest of it is so rock solid. Really, this is a classic that keeps getting better the more we play it.

RATING: 7
The mechanics all fit together nicely, but it's ultimately undone for me by the variable ending conditions.  I think they add a lot of tension to the game, but the problem with them is that pushing for one victory condition or another is ultimately inefficient for scoring in the victory condition you're pushing for, benefiting those who do not take sides.  The all or nothing nature of the thing can make it pointless for you to have even played.  Best demonstrated in the three player game, once two people decide to go in the opposite direction from you, you lose.  Gold is worthless in the Inca victory, and unless the player is absolutely playing like crap, the 3x multiplier in a Spanish victory is impossible to beat.  I've won games where I had say 21 points and another player 31 before the gold, but I ended up winning because I had ONE more gold.  I can see why some people like this tension, but it seems clear to me the other player played the much better game having nearly the same gold, but beating my pre-multiplier score by 50%.

The game is dominated by which way the game ends, and it lessens the value of the rest of the game.  I'd only find it acceptable in a much shorter game.  

Even with these problems the game is interesting enough to beat out Hamburgum and Antike for me.

[b]Design:- [/b]:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:  [i]Resource engine with shared actions; area influence scoring combined with build scoring.[/i]

[b]Execution:- [/b]:star::star::star::star::nostar:  [i]Allegedly uses a variant on the familiar "rondel" mechanism which feels more like movement because that is exactly what it is.  Movement has a function in the selection of an action, but comparisons to the good old rondel are pointless - the restriction is geographic not linear.  The value of resources is very changeable, giving an interesting economic background; however the ultimate purpose of resources means this is overshadowed by the semi-arbitrary draw of the cards.[/i]
 
[b]Experience:- [/b]:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:  [i]There are few problems to solve; get the right resources to place workers and take priests and virgins.  Difficult to tell if you are actually able to control much of what happens .[/i]

[b]Presentation:- [/b]:star::star::star::star::star:  [i]Beautiful components help this game's aesthetic feel immensely.  The rules are well laid out and good examples alleviate confusion.[/i]

This is one of those games that is fairly enjoyable to play but doesn't really do much more than other games in the economic enginge genre.  The added uncertainty of the card draw when your scout reaches the peak helps convince me that this game is one of those in which you could plan for victory only to see it scuppered by a dodgy card draw..

Worker placement with a twist.  There is great subtlety in the traitor aspect. An independent strategy won't work - one must play to the group think.  I'd like to play a game when with lateral thinkers/  non gamers who don't go for the build an economy option and see if we could get through the sacrifice deck instead

RATING: 7
Whatever your opinion of The Princes of Machu Picchu, there is no denying that it is a fairly unusual resource management game.

The centerpiece (and also the single most controversial game element) is the scoring that differs significantly depending on which of the two ending conditions is met. The major points of contention seem to be how well players can actually engineer a particular ending, and that the multipliers for the Conquistadors scoring are essentially based on hidden information. In both cases, experienced players seem to say there is no problem. I'll take their word for it right now, but I do have to admit I'm not totally convinced of it myself although the outlook is positive after the first few plays.

The rondel system is introduced as the game board itself.  Gerdts seems to have another winning design here as there is a lot going on; each mechanic seemingly has an interesting synergy with other mechanics generating what appears, after one play, to be a lot of depth.  I do however, wonder if gameplay will differentiate enough in subsequent outings to keep the interest high .  Are there really a lot of things happening, or is it a well crafted mirage?  Is the core game really only a series of minute tactical adjustments to the card draws?  Is there synergy between players' decisions? Machu Picchu is definitely a title worth exploring.

The end game scoring and purchasing placements with multiple resources is similar to Concordia. The mechanics and board are much different though.

Action selection is mildly restrictive and lends itself to quality tactical and strategic decisions.

Lots of beautiful theme in this game.  The moon tiles are more fun than the candle in Luna but no one ever mentions that.  This is a hidden Gem.  One I am glad I own.

Played 3+ Played with 4 players and with 2 and both worked well. This is a wonderful design but the board is ugly. Oct 08

*UPDATE* My third play and this is the game that is getting to the table ahead of our other Essen 08 games. There is a very bold piece of design in this game regarding the victory conditions. The game can end one of two ways and the way victory is determined is completely different dependant on this. You will not know which system is to be used until the game is almost over, players do have some influence over which condition is triggered but an individual player’s actions can not guarantee which way the game will go. This is a very bold move by Mac Gerdts but it works and I admire him the more for having the confidence to put this dual end condition into his design. Gerdts has just become my favourite designer (Knizia lost the crown when I played Strozzi and I saw the good doctor had no more to give to our hobby) Nov 08

*UPDATE* Played with 5 and I think it is probably at its best with this number, very enjoyable. I based my whole game around getting a Spanish end game. This added a very exciting ellement to the game. Mar 11

RATING: 3
Rating after one play with 5 players:

After Mac Gerdts' brilliant games Imperial and Antike this one really sucks.  

A good gamer's game should be complex, challenging and elegant.  Unfortunately this one is rather complicated, tedious and confusing.  Took us almost 3 hours and after that everyone was exhausted and rather glad that the game was over.  

What bugs me most is that this game seems to be missing clear and recognizable goals both for the end of game and while playing.  In Imperial, for example you can develop a long term strategy by focussing on a series of intermediate goals: buy armies, conquer a territory, collect taxes.  In "Princes of Machu Picchu" it's more like a confusing mess of separate actions which hopefully will make sense after 2/3 of the game is played.

Maybe it's better with fewer players but I prefer to spend my time with the author's other games.

RATING: 4
Gather resources, build stuff, repeat. Very uninspired design that is not even good at combining old mechanics, as there is no tension nor interesting strategic decisions. But the worst is the scoring system, which gets even worse if the game ends with the conquest by the Spanish. Either way, it clearly favors simple card accumulation, but in the Spanish conquest ending, it also should be very hard to beat the player with most gold (although the rulebook tries to state otherwise with very unlikely numbers). And the amateurish art on the confusing board shows that the publisher urgently needs to hire a better artist - Macchu Pichu has never been so ugly!

Fascinating game from the same designer who brought us Antike and Imperial. The Rondel is gone, sort of, and now we have a total departure in theme, transporting us back to the days of the Inca Civilization, on the eve of the Spanish conquest. The rondel has been replaced with a bigger "rondel", where you don't necessarily have to go in a clockwise fashion, but can go to an adjacent space in one of several possible directions. The usual spaces where you collect resources are there, as well as the spaces where you spend the resources to get additional workers, priests and virgins, to enable scoring, as well as progress up a mountain path. At the top you get sacrifice cards, that coupled with the worker placement and/or priest/virgin collection allow you to score at the end of the game.

The initial play is somewhat confusing, as it takes awhile to understand the intricate sequence of actions that are necessary to get the all important sacrifice cards. This reminds me of the intricacy in Reef Encounter, but the reasoning inherent in Machu Picchu makes sense. Rules are straight forward, and it is strongly recommended to print out the player aids here on the Geek, because the ones that come with the game show only half the info needed to play the game.

We have yet to finish a complete game--our first one took over an hour to get past turn one of a six turn game, with 5 players. We had yet to get a sacrifice card, so clearly, we are still flailing around trying to get our bearings. Still, there is a sense this will be a good game. Update to follow.

Update (6/30/09) - Finished our first 5P game at 2-2.5 hours. It was a close game, where the VP spread was one point: 3 players got 13 pts, with tiebreaker coming down to a one resource difference, and 2 players got 12 pts, for an Inca victory. Neat game; it will take several plays to figure out the flow, sort of like Reef Encounter, as it is not necessarily intuitive.

Update (09/17/09) - Finished 5P game in 2.5 hours, with all veterans. I finally won with 29 pts, with the spread being about 5 pts apart, with the "corn" strategy! It's the sacrifice cards... stupid! Every action must somehow translate into scout movement, to get the cards, not units or buildings like in other games. Also, the inca placement and the cards must complement each other, like in Oasis. Concentration on one or two items, and get lots of inca workers on that space and/or lots of sacrifice cards. The "Llama-Warp" (TM) cannot be underestimated either.

Update (08/17/10) 4 plays: The strategy is now to let Machu Picchu fall... unthinkable, but the best way to win huge points, as seemingly insignificant scores get doubled and tripled! Thus, this creates tension in the game as players accuse each other of conspiring to let the Spaniards in! There is an interesting balance in the sacrifice cards, in that the ones with the fewest gold statues reward inca placement on commodities, such as corn, llamas, coca leaves, pots, or shirts, while the ones with the most gold statues reward collection of virgins and priests! Thus, the players collecting virgins and priests may be tempted to somehow sabotage and accelerate the game end! This is contrary to the other game end condition where the players are trying to rescue all of the virgins and priests! Fascinating push-pull mechanic that is hidden in the scoring.

Update (1/8/11) 5 plays: Finally got my own copy, first play. 1 newbie + 4 veterans = 3 brutal hours for a measly 12 to 30 pts. One virgin away from saving Machu Picchu, but we let it fall. The guy with 30 pts had the most gold statues, for tripling his score to an unheard of 90 pts. It can be depressing to put in that much time and only score 20 points, but that's the game. Overdid production at expense of climbing the mountain path--It's the sacrifice cards, stupid.

Update (1/22/11) 6 plays: First 3 player game, which seemed to go fast. Do NOT let a single player have the first priest/virgin for several turns! That guy went on to collect 10-11 sacrifice cards to turn 24 pts into 72 pts! Finally evaluated the distribution of gold statues:
7 statues - 3x (virgin + priest)
6 statues - 5x (condor priest + commodity)
5 statues - 5x (puma priest + commodity)
4 statues - 5x (virgin + commodity)
3 statues - 10x (commodity + commodity)

Best way to get most statues is to go for sacrifice cards with both priests and virgin (or the condor priest if coupling with the commodity strategy). Although relatively expensive, having a virgin card gives the fastest track up the scout trail for even more cards. Having three of the same virgin/priest cards and sacrificing for 15 to 21 steps is just sick! Don't let anyone get three of the same!

Update (11/20/11) 9 plays: Do not let anyone get three of the same priest! In a 3 player game, one person managed to get three puma priests, and swiftly went up the scout trail to collect the most sacrifice cards. The 3 player game has an interesting dynamic where one player wants Machu Pichu to fall, one wants to save it, and the third has to decide which condition to go for. Will he/she have enough gold to have their score doubled or perhaps tripled? Or will they have enough Inca worker presence on the board and win with a straight (non-multiplied) score? The decisions each player has to make is simultaneously traumatizing and delicious. If everyone is a veteran, the game is perfectly balanced to go either way within one or two movements on the board. We've gotten the game down to two hours and some change for three. It is vitally important to have the game explained well, as the sequence of actions is not intuitive at first, and takes several plays to "get it".

Update (12/29/12) 10 plays: We've managed to get a 4 player game down to about 90 minutes, not including setup and tear down. It plays as fast as Antike in terms of downtime if everyone knows how to play. We played fast, but did we play well? That remains to be seen.

Update (01/03/2014) 13 plays: 3-player game, where all three conspired to let Machu Picchu fall. Very few incas placed early in the game, so very little production build-up. Corn production was relatively untouched, as the needed corn was gotten via the path or moon tile. It seems significant to get at least one of the 7-statues sacrifice cards early to determine if you're going to let Machu Picchu fall. In our 3-player game, two of us went for it, ending up with 41 statues each! (I later found that the other player should have had 2 extra statues for their position on the scout track.) The third player was the odd man, and knew early on that not getting gold statues was trouble. With its very intricate decision space, temporary semi-cooperative nature with hidden agendas like in Archipelago, this makes it a medium-heavy weight game with a lot to sink your teeth into--this is one great game in that regard; easy mechanics, but tough to play well. There's plenty of postmortem analysis, meaning there's plenty of tough decisions and exciting gameplay. I would up it to a "9", but it does require some mental preparation. Set-up is involved, so it doesn't see the table as often as it should.

Update (04/05/2015) 15 plays: 3-player game, where all three let Machu Picchu fall. Opening uncovered where placing prince in Potter's Quarter or Coca Plantation (if not already taken) is possibly very strong, with follow-up move to Royal Hut to place 2-3 Incas elsewhere. After that, there is less worry about being "locked" out of not being able to produce on the next day due to not having an Inca in a given district, but you still need to reserve a piece of corn or two for feeding the Inca(s). This means placing your very first Inca in the Corn Plantation, so you can immediately generate corn on your turn and be ready to feed. This may not work in a 4 or 5 player game. However, as a general rule, you probably do not want to visit either the Workman's or Royal Hut until you have enough resources to get at least two Incas. This is because every visit is expensive in terms of time. Also, essential to have at least one Llama in reserve (and one corn) for potential sacrifices (if you have priests and/or virgins) or for the "Llama Warp" to grab double cylinders or resources on the other side of the board.

After playing it sporadically over a period of six years, I now consider this is great game, even if it isn't a "10", but it admittedly has a very high learning curve to appreciate its greatness. The individual "micro" actions may seem tedious to some, but the underlying "hidden" team, temporary cooperative alliance, push-pull mechanic caused by the race for gold statues in the sacrifice cards is pure genius of board gaming design.

Fun game but maybe a little bit too "Euro" for my tastes... the game can be summarized like "place workers to get A, B, and C; convert them to D; use them to buy E; get victory points".  I love the theme though and that's what elevates it from a "meh" game to a "pretty good" game.
Going for the Spanish Conquest victory really annoys those who have amassed LOTS of victory points!
Also - having now visited the Inca Trail and Machu Picchu and learned a lot about its history, I can see where Mac Gertz got inspired to make this game.  The economic system makes so much thematic sense and the paths to victory are very nicely integrated.  Rating is upgraded to 8.

" A nem túl szép tábla Machu Picchu városának valós térképét ábrázolja, ré¬giókra felosztva. Ezek a régiók jellemzően toborzó- és termelőhelyek, valamint templomok. Érdekesség, hogy a templomok elhelyezkedése a térképen megfelel a valóságnak.  A játék kilenc nap történését öleli fel. Mind a kilenc nap során a játékosok felváltva mozgatják a hercegeiket és látogatnak meg bizonyos helyszíneket. A meglátogatott helyszínhez tartozó akció aktiválódik. Bármikor ingyen léphetünk át a szomszédos helyszínekre, vagy elutazhatunk bármelyik szabadon választott helyre egy láma beadásával. Ez a mechanika egy módosított rondellának felel meg, ami valamivel több szabadságot nyújt, mint a klasszikus társa, ahol csak előrefele haladhatunk, és mindig csak egy-egy szomszédunk van. 
Bizonyos helyszínek aktiválásával nyersanyaghoz juthatunk. Ezek a helyszínek mindennap csak egyet¬len egyszer aktiválhatóak. Érdekes mechanika, hogy maga az aktiváló játékos csak egyetlen nyersanyagot kap, illetve aktiválja az összes ott dolgozó munkást, akik viszont bárkihez tartozhatnak. 
Ötféle nyersanyagot tudunk termelni/készíteni a játékban, és mindhez tartozik egy megfelelő helyszín. Két másik területen munkásokat helyezhetünk fel a táblára. Ők lesznek azok a munkások, akik akkor termelnek nekünk, ha valaki aktiválja a megfelelő termelőterületet. Minden munkásért különböző nyersanyag-kombinációval kell fizetnünk. 
A játékban az áldozatok bemutatásához fontos, hogy megfelelő papokat szerezzünk. A három istennek külön papjai vannak. Igen drágán tudjuk őket megszerezni. Papjaink száma meghatározza, hogy mennyi áldozatot tudunk bemutatni az adott istennek. Az áldozatok bemutatásáért cserébe a felderítőnkkel léphetünk a tábla tetején található inka ösvényen. Ha felérünk az ösvény tetejére, akkor kapunk három áldozati kártyát, amik közül egyet megtarthatunk, és rögtön megkezdhetjük lentről az új zarándokutunkat. Az áldozati kártyák kombinációja határozza majd meg a játék végi pontjainkat. Ha valaki aktiválja a templomot, akkor mindenki maximum annyi lámát áldozhat fel, ahány adott típusú papja van. Érdekes mechanika, hogy ahogy egyre több pap kerül játékba, úgy válik minden áldozat egyre kevés¬bé értékessé. A főtemplomhoz nem kellenek papok. Ezt aktiválva bárki mutathat be áldozatot különböző nyersanyagok beadásával. 

A játékosok a fenti akciókat hajtják végre felváltva egészen addig, amíg véget nem ér a nap. Bárki dönthet úgy a körében, hogy gyakorlatilag passzol, és a cselekvés helyett elvesz egyet a hét holdlapkából. Ezek különféle előnyöket biztosítanak, amik nem is olyan gyenge bónuszok. Amint 3 lapkát elvittünk, véget ér a nappal, és jön az éjszaka, valamint a következő forduló. 
A játék során, ha ügyesek voltunk, akkor egy csomó áldozati kártyát szereztünk. Ezeken a kártyákon vala¬milyen szimbólum található, erre ad pontot a játék végén az adott kártya. Ezek jellemzően valamelyik isten papjai, illetve a táblán egy adott mezőre lehelyezett munkások lehetnek. Minél több kártyánk van az adott szimbólummal, annál több pontot érnek a munkások, illetve a papok, így a jó magas pontszámok reményé¬ben muszáj valamennyire specializálódnunk a játék során. 
A Princes of Machu Picchu egy közepesnél nehe¬zebb, de nem vészesen nehéz eurojáték. A játék ügyesen lép ki a rondellás megszokásból, mi¬közben az alap ismertető jegyeket továbbra is magán hordozza. Ezzel és egy pár jó ötlettel sikerült egy tel¬jesen egyedi játékot összerakni, ami biztosan nem fog azért kikerülni a készletből, mert „olyan, mint a…”. (by fisha)

In spite of the designer's protestations this IS a rondel game, it's just that this time the rondel is two-dimensional and fills most of the board. In all it's nothing very different: get resources, trade, build things ('priests' in this case), get victory points. To be fair, I think this is Mac Gerdts' best design to date, but it's still quite a modest portfolio.

I am a huge Mac Gerdts fan; He might be my favorite game designer. I was curious about the Princes of Machu Pichu but I knew it was probably his least regarded game. Y'all need to desist with smoking that crack. The Princes of Machu Pichu is fun. I would buy it. It is slightly convoluted and the graphic design of the board is mildly messy--the lines indicating adjacency of the different regions which trigger different interesting actions: these lines could be clearer possibly, if Mr Gerdts wasn't trying so hard to overlay these regions with a illustration of the ancient city ruins. This game has flavor. It is stimulating and fun. It doesn't take all day to play. The Princes of Machu Pichu does induce analysis paralysis, just like most of my favorite games do. There are elements of the Princes of Machu Pichu that remind me very much of one of my all time favorite games, Concordia. In particular, collecting differently shaped and painted wooden resources which are used to invest in building my engine or investing in one of several victory path strategies. And then, get this, the game either ends with Spaniards wiping us all out and the player with the most gold wins, or we buy out all the priests or collect all the victory multiplier cards. What a cool and fun game. Well done, Mr Gerdts!

RATING: 5.7
July09: Overly ingenious without any real room for different strategies.  When viewed as an efficiency game, it seems rather convoluted.

Anyway, it's still better than Antike or Hamburgum.  It's not on the same level as Imperial though.

The turns *should* come fast and furious.  You care what the other people do because often it triggers your own production or sacrifice.

The game map actually does force you to plan out your moves.  The adjacencies take a game or so to get used to, but from there it's solid.

But in the end, it's just not that jazzy since every game is going to play almost the same.  I mean, sure, the Spanish may or may not win.  But I bet you the player with the most cards is going to have a heck of a chance at winning.

It also takes a lot longer than it should.

Gioco interessante, con due finali.

RATING: 8
Very initial rating 1 play 5 players Essen 08

First I have to say, this is, much_better_than_Hamburger err Hamburgum. I like Mac's other two games but that one really got dull fast, like half way through the first game. Ok, now that thats out of the way...

Truthfully this game is one of those ones that is a hard one to judge on just one playing, and we played a full game. The game seemed to relate well to the theme, his most thematic to date I would say. 

Several things are intertwined together here, as you most likely know already the whole board becomes a rondel in this game which was the most logical progression for the rondel I would say. This doesn't really change it a whole lot and as usual it works well.  You are mainly trying to climb the mountain which is represented by an incremental track on the board in order to get some random VP cards. Why these are random is the card you get dealt after a succesful climb has different symbols on it, these mutliple for points at the endgame in a StoneAge like way. So getting these sooner is important for planning but ultimately the later ones you get you will have no control over how much they help you. 

There was more than one way to climb the mountain but the main one involved collecting resources by visiting the various board regions and then obtaining Priests. Priests are then used for sacrifices at temples which help you to climb, the importnat thing here was when other people do this if you have the same priest you could ALSO climb. 

Essentially thats the game, there was also another ending condition that could be triggered which would mean whoever had the most gold symbols on their VP cards were going to have their score tripled! Next most was going to double, wow, talk about changing the endgame. In our game we found it quite hard to climb the mountain but I think inexpereince with the system contributed to that a fair bit. Our scores at the end of a 5 player game were: 14,13,13,12 & 6. 

The Jury is still out for the most part for all of us that played but the game seemed fairly solid and kept our interest unlike Hamburgum, more to explore here than that game I would say. I dislike the random score cards but trying to get some early means you could work towards them, not sure that will be enough consolation. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 7 => 8  Son of a ____!  The RGG guy in Essen missed a HUGE rule, the game is WAY better with the correct rule. I hope this is right, when you pick up a scoring card you pick up 3 cards and throw 2 away AND you can even throw away old cards from before which makes mixing and matching WAY easier.  

Anyway I really like the game, it’s a engine resource management game and a pretty good one.  The ending can be a little uncontrollable if it gets down too one of the two conditions being met AND the 9th round ending.  This was quite an exciting ending actually as no one knew whether or not gold was going to become a HUGE factor with a triple and a doubling of score coming in to play, in our game where it came down to the very last turn and the last priest was bought up and gold was nullified! Exciting but this obviously determined the winner. I’m not sure yet how much I like this, more play to determine, it might only happen 1 in 5 games in this way but either way by it being a threat I think it adds quite an exciting if not somewhat random element to the game.

I love Concordia, but I generally dislike Mac Gerdts rondel games. When I bought The Princes of Machu Picchu I didn’t know if it was a rondel game or not, gladly it isn’t and I liked it :D. My expectation for the game was low but it surprised me.

The rules of the game aren’t complex. You can teach it under 10 minutes. Playtime is from 90 to 120 minutes, it depends on the number of players.

The game´s components are good, the board is big and colorful. It is double sided but both sides are exactly the same except for the language. The board looks gorgeous on the table with all components on top of it.

The theme is novel, I kind of like it.

The Princes of Machu Picchu´s decisions are interesting and non-obvious. Timing is key to win the game. In the game you can move your prince to a position in the map, if it is near its free, if it is far away you need to pay to move there. You can also pass and take a bonus token, when three of these tokens are taken the round will end. Among the actions you can do are: Getting more Incas to work for you, get priest/virgins to make sacrifices, getting a kind of resource, making a sacrifice to move your scout, buy or sell resources and go to the sun clock . Most of the actions are communal if players have the requirements to play them, so analyzing your opponents moves and time your movements accordingly is key. The game can end in two different ways, either the Spanish arrive and then gold becomes very important or if players take all priests and virgins the Incans win and the player with better sacrifices wins the game. It is very cool. I would think the game ends most times by Incan victory but I need more plays to verify this.

Best with 3 players as it flows fast and it can end in either Spanish or Incan victory.

The Princes of Machu Picchu feel somewhat similar to Concordia in many ways.

Bottom line, The Princes of Machu Picchu is a good Euro game, it rewards careful planning and timing and I liked it. These days I’m enjoying Marc Gerds´ games, this means I already pre ordered his new game (Transatlantic) and perhaps I will revisit games I didn’t like in the past (Antike, and more important Imperial) to see if I can appreciate them now.  I will keep it among my game collection for now.

One of 2008´s favorites.

Princes of Machu Picchu has a lot of innovative elements to it.  The dual ending is inspired in theory - although I'm not sure whether it works yet in practice.  To an extent one is at the mercy of the cards, though there's an attempt to mitigate this by making all card draws "draw 3, discard 2."

Theme binding is a little sloppy - why is there a llama stable two-thirds of the way up the mountain?  But I don't think any game where one can ride llamas and grow cocaine can be accused of having a poor theme.

This game could end up among my favorites once I figure it out.  Or it could fall just short.

After a few plays, I'm not sure what 'strats' there are.  Sure, you need to place workers and collect resources and buy priests/virgins, but I'm not exactly sure 'how' to do that best.  The games generally end with all players pretty close.  Something tells me that I'm missing something, but I keep coming back for more!?

How many different mechanics can you stuff into one game? Hideous to explain, but ultimately pretty quick to play once you FINALLY grasp it. The theme choice is pretty arbitrary and executed in the form of llama sacrifice to priests and virgins (which you must buy), worker placement to produce goods, but with the requirement of paying goods to place the workers, which is a bizarre chicken-and-egg situation. Game actions are taken by moving to different areas of the map, in what is basically a spatial rondel. Scoring takes place at the end and comes in two wildly different forms depending on whether or not all the priests or scoring cards were bought up or taken during play (why????). 

A frighteningly bad game that is needlessly abstruse and seems to have followed a design philosophy of turning any process into 5 steps when just 1 or 2 would do fine.

Interesting resource management game with two ways to end the game which impacts the final scoring. I think our group has had some difficulty working with others at the table who are looking to have the same end game scoring come about. This has left us with a lot of Spanish victory end games.

Essen 2008. Played twice and like it, but tripling the score for the Spanish conquest game ending condition seems a tad powerful as I've won both games by accumulating the most gold (which is affected by luck-of-the-draw). Time will tell if this is a real problem, or if it is a newbie problem. That said, I still like it enough for an initial rating of about 8, and if it is a real problem it shouldn't be too difficult to adjust the multiplier as a variant to make it less so.

Machu Picchu is one of the weirdest games I've come across in a while. Expect a huge WTF factor upon seeing board/components, hearing the theme, and enduring the rules explanation. But also expect to get over it half-way through and realize that you're in the middle of an expertly designed game that you're playing badly. Some games take existing elements and rework them into something elegant but overly familiar - Endeavor would be a good example. Less often, a game will take such confident ownership of its sources that you experience revelation instead of recognition. Machu Picchu is such a game. It incorporates elements from Glory to Rome (clients/bonus actions), Puerto Rico (cumulative value for unused spaces), Amun-Re (private scoring cards which influence board placement), perhaps Caylus (pacing control), and the designer's previous Rondel games. You need to build up infrastructure to keep a steady flow of resources going. You need to plan sequences of moves depending on your opponents' likely courses of action. At a certain point you need to recruit priests from the various temples and send them on pilgrimages up the Incan Trail. Each time you reach the summit you get a scoring card with private incentives for certain board placements. There's also a major twist in the scoring system. If players are not able to recruit all of the priests by the end of the game, the Conquistadors show up and skew the scoring heavily in favor of the players with the most gold on their scoring cards.

Is it a great game? I have no idea.

Update: Rating raised to a solid 8 following a second play. We're starting to get the hang of it. Could actually be my favorite Mac Gerdts title. 

Update: Following a third play I'm feeling much more at home with the game. I think it's settling into an 8 for me. The game's overall arc may end up feeling tighter than I'd like - not sure. You really need players who know the scoring to get a satisfying game out of this.

This game requires building up an economy to produce resources. There is a market for trading. Resources are used to buy priests or virgins through which sacrifices allow one to move up a mountain path. Getting to the top if the mountain gives the player a sacrifice card and restarts the climb at the bottom of the mountain. The sacrifice cards have icons that are multipliers with the priest and virgin cards. This is an interesting game, but is somewhat complex and can take a couple plays to fully understand.

The princes of Machu Picchu is a fun game, with lots of game bits. 
The main goal is to collect as many sacrifies cards, with in combination with how many incas you have played on the board, will add up your victory points.

Of negative comments on the game, the lack of interaction between the players is mentioned... except when the prince is entering an area with other players incas.

The game can in this way be compared to Thurn & Taxis, where everybody are doing their own thing. 

Besides that the game is deeper than expected. There are several ways to win the game.

The Princes of Machu Picchu certainly is Mac Gerdt's most controverse game. Half of the players in my group were really annoyed by the alternative Spaniard victory condition which introduces VP multipliers that can lead to huge gaps in scores. To make things worse, we played with 5 which makes this game overly long to accept the seemingly random multipliers. Sad, as it will be very hard now getting it to the table again. They'll miss out on the sublime additonal strategic level of working with/towards the victory conditions and timing the end of the rounds accordingly. Other than that, it's clearly recognizable as a Gerdt's game with action restrictions imposed by the board (kind of a hidden rondel), getting your engine to run efficiently and choosing your VP multipliers. To put it into the context of his other games:
First tier: Imperial / Imperial 2030
Second tier: Navegador / Princes of Machu Picchu
Third tier: Hamburgum
Fouth tier (won't play again): Antike

The rondel game without a rondel.  I think it has very clever mechanics for gaining resources and grabbing priests and virgins, and I think the two ways the game might end puts different priorities on how players will act.  I look forward to more plays of this one.

Too hard to get a good grip on the game after one play.  I applaud the unusual theme, though it still does seem very thin.  But we could use more of this stuff.

I would definitely like to try this again to firm up my rating.

Excellent but strange and intriguing economic strategy game. During the game there is no luck, only the choices of the other players will influence your actions and choices. The victory points depend on an element of luck (card draw) which is quite acceptable (a lucky card draw might influence who wins, but in general you can control this a little bit or build up strength on the board based on the cards you already collected). Nevertheless, timing of key decisions is crucial, because tripling or doubling your base score depending on the end conditions could have a huge impact on the final scores. This is the most intriguing and antagonising element of the game and makes it a nailbiting experience until the very end! Final scores can be very close and rather low (when Machu Picchu survives) or with very big differences and high (when the Spaniards invade at the end of the nighth day). Playing with three allows more planning on the board, but playing with five is also fun.

A multi-faceted resource management/economics game.  There are two different ways that the game can end (Inca wins or Spaniards win), and thus, there's two different scoring methods to be concerned about.  Keep in mind that players will usually be motivated more or less, by one method or the other.  I tend to think that Inca might tend to win more often but I could also see (a) player(s) push to end each round quickly.

RATING: 6.5
Decent Euro with smooth mechanics that encourages players to maximize their benefits and handle their resources as effectively as possible.  The gold scoring end game for the Spanish victory condition seems over valued and makes it difficult in a four player game at least to take any cards that don't give one the biggest gold bang for the buck.

Fairly pedestrian sort-of-worker-placement game. The only thing that really stands out here is the staggeringly hideous board. Parent game boards tell their small game boards that if they don't eat their vegetables, they will grow up to look like this.

RATING: 8
Very nice. Longer than the other Mac Games because the Rondel is spread all over the board. The borders can be difficult to 'demarcate'. I like the board, but it makes this game more difficult to get into than it should be. I expect this will ultimately wind up with a lower rating than the 3 prior games, and I blame the board in large part for this.

Still... I'm dissing the game, yet I rate it an '8'. It's another fun resource optimization machine, with the nice Mac Gerts touch of feeling and being chaotic enough to be subtly flexible with what you ultimately end up doing.

BITS PIMPING: We replaced the Grain Chits with wooden Agricola Yellow Grain and Orange Pumpkin bits, counting as 3 and 1 respectively.

I'm a bit torn about this one. Everyone, including my self was engaged by the variety of decisions and the sheer timing challenges involved in Princes. The whole game was tense, and in all there seems to be a ton of strategy.

It seems that running the sacrifice deck out isn't too difficult, which mitigates my major concern of the Spanish showing up and giving the random tripling or doubling of someone's score my pure venom toward the game.

Indeed the goal of a player who is ahead is to get priests/virgins, get 4+ cards, manipulate their pieces to fit those cards and run the deck out FTW.

Tentative 7 until I find out if my feelings are correct. Could easily be an 8, but I suspect the random element keeps it a solid, enjoyable 7; even if the game is a tad long for my tastes.

Played once, at the end of a long day in Essen. Good strategy game although without many original elements. The trade-off between the two possible endings of the game seemed interesting, but since both favour the player who collects the most Sacrifice cards, it may not matter in which way the game ends (as was the case in my one playing). So one strategic aspect of the game (which kind of ending do I aim for?) might not be such a big deal, and the rest is really another "collect resources and use them to either increase your potential of gathering resources, or to collect victory points" game. A good one, sure, but I'm not sure I actually need another good game of this kind.

Usually, winning a heavy strategy game gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling. So it can be safely regarded as a major bad sign that my main reaction to winning my first game of Maccu Picchu by the breadth of a hair was an exasperated sigh instead of a self-satisfied grin. I was mainly glad that it was over, which might have been due to a lot of downtime in our inexperienced group. However, some postprandial discussion helped my to pinpoint my main problems with this game.

Now, the fact that Maccu Picchu tries new things both with regards to its theme and the mechanics - especially the victory conditions - automatically gains it some bonus points. However, it is mainly those new things that make it a failure for me. Hinging a victory point multiplication factor of 3x or 2x to a game condition that can be influenced by all players is novel and brave, but the fact that the decisive resource for getting this factor is a) hidden and b) doled out randomly only a couple of times (four to six, I’d guess) per game turns it into quite a crap shoot, which I find hard to tolerate in such a long game. Discovering after 150 minutes that you’ve got 24 gold to my 23 and therefore get your VPs doubled whereas I get nada is no fun for either side, I feel.

Furthermore, the fresh theming of precolumbian cultures is let down by the extremely unsatisfying implementation. First, the game never feels like more than an abstract with window-dressing. Second, a game of this length should have a satisfying narrative arc. Doing the same things in a marginally more capable way round after round while your VP card gatherer is literally running in circles did not feel satisfying to me.

All in all, this is one of the weaker rondel (or quasi-rondel) games for me, and it is the most disappointing one due to its unfulfilled potential.

After one play, reminds me of Caylus. There's plenty of things you should be doing, so the hardest part is choosing and balancing between them. I'm fairly comfident my strategies would evolve if I played this more. Now it seemed sometimes a bit random, cause I wasn't quite sure what's most important and where to begin.

I like the fact that is impossible to calculate the progress of each player and that it has the sense of a "rodel" game. Besides that it's a solid game but not as good as the masterpieces Imperial or Antike. It has similarities to Hamburgum that I also like very much.

I think I like this one, but it needs more plays. Acquiring your goods, make offerings and run up the Inca-trail, where you get to pick one out of three cards each time, which give you the points or gold to win. Some luck in the cards though, but I do like the two different win-conditions.

A great combination of mechanics you're familiar with mixed with a unique game play experience.  The pace of the game is great since you're just activating a small action each turn but the overall strategy is quite intriguing as there are a number of opportunity costs with your decisions that may only be netting you short term gains.  When you need to travel across the board to arrive at "the" action you most want to trigger, since it may take a few turns you'll need to try to figure out which spaces to invest your time and resources in who you might be helping on the way.  Or you could sacrifice a llama to get there quicker spending one of the most valuable goods in your hand.

The stock game is interesting.  On the main map if you invest with others you're more likely to have that action triggered more often at the potential cost of having too many goods of one type produced thus driving down the value of them.  If you invest with others on the Priests and Virgins then your ability to sacrifice to them will be increased but then the end-game VP value of that commodity is diluted as less are available to you.

RATING: 7.3
A really good game with an "imaginative" theme! for a game that runs for 2 hours there is always plenty to think about between turns so time doesn't appear to drag.
The other feature is that it is difficult to see who is winning during the game, so this avoids the problems of the trailing players feeling that there is nothing they can do to recover their position.
Game mechanics mean that this game is more suitable for gaming groups than families.

It's basically Hamburgum taken up a level, with slightly more blocking and slightly more positional considerations. I rather liked it, though I don't really have a good sense of how to strategically control which of the win conditions happens (both of my games resulted in an Aztec victory). I'm curious to see how viable the conquistador strategy is, and whether or not one person can force it.

"The obfuscated rondell...", I don't think that this game offers enough options. You either win by getting the most cards on Mount Pichu oder you win by getting the most points on Mount Pichu after you counted your gold pieces on the cards. Either way, you need to select your actions, move around the board and get up the mountain. No real decisions I think.

After one play, it seems like the Spanish end game is the easiest to bring about. It's pretty easy to push the round to an end if you think you are ahead, and there really feels like there is limited opportunity to gain priests. An afterthought was that you could bulk up in the corn market and then just buy what you need. Or bulk up in one of the item markets and sell them to get other items. Still, I'm not sure how easy it would be to prevent the Spanish end game.

RATING: 7
First impression (5 players): The game feels a lot like Hamburgum in a good way. In both games the players gather and manipulate resources in a similar way. Princes of Machu Picchu gets some bonus in my eyes for a little different theme than usually. Not that it really shows too much during playing. 

After one game it is a bit hard to see how frequent different ending conditions are in the game. However I'm a little bit worried that the end scoring multipliers coming from cards decide just a tad too much. Getting a lot of one category is very strong and eventually quite random. This actually is probably biggest problem with full five players so in games with fewer players you might get a little bit more of cards and therefore better chances of finding what you need.

RATING: N/A
A wonderful gift from our Secret Santa in 2011. A hidden gem of a game. It is rather simple but with many levels of strategic complexity. The mechanics are all well integrated. The bits are outstanding and their are a lot of them. The little shirts for weavers, the llamas, the little clay pots and leaves for coca...wonderful! I love the dash to the summit of Machu Pichu to earn sacrifice cards. Matching the symbols on the cards to earn victory points in combination with all the Incas you place out on the board is fun and reminds me a bit of Oltre Mare. Maneuvering one's prince around the board is tricky, you need to think ahead to be sure you maximize your progress in the game. 

One of the most interesting features is you never really know how soon a day will end. You can take what seems like endless turns before someone triggers the end of day. A delight to play and works very well with 2 players and probably is a lot of fun and a faster game with more players. With 2 players the game does take awhile to play, but I feel like if we really race to try to beat the Spaniards by buying up the temple cards and collect up the sacrifice cards we may have a real 90 min. game. Needs more plays.

I'm a fan of the rondel, and this is a very neat take on it, modifying the linearity to effectively allow moves in either direction or sacrifice stuff to move anywhere. Try and collect stuff and move more efficiently than others. You're pretty much led to collect bits of everything to collect scoring cards, but these cards will then lead you to invest down different paths than other players. A game I'd like to explore further. My one concern is that you can be easily knocked out if you commit early to a spanish or non-spanish win, which might tend to lead everyone towards a balanced strategy, which makes for perhaps a less interesting game.

Compared to mr Gerdts Imperial, his newer "The Prices of Machu Picchu" felt like a less straightforward affair. It's an ambitious design I guess, but it was an rather awkward experience early in the game. My brain had a lot more struggle with this one than Imperial, despite it's lower weight-rating on the Geek. It is a great theme, but I think the actions you did on the board felt somewhat arbitary and dispached to the theme. 

It was fun and really interresting, but the "Conquistador" ending killed a great deal of the joy for me. Alright, I actually won in my first and only game, and by quite some margin. But I was in third or fourth place in a fiveplayer game before the last parameter - gold - was to be counted, and then I suddenly got an awful lot of points because of the Conquistador bonus. I did not do better than the others on the board, but when the alternative ending was triggered I was lucky I had chosed card with lots of gold.

This rating could change with more plays of course.

RATING: 7
Now 5 plays in, spread across the range of players (twice with 4) and I'm still trying to work out if I can implement some kind of strategy. I strongly believe it boils down to knowing the sacrifice deck distribution (7 of each symbol) and their coin values (priest cards worth more) & what your odds are of drawing a card of that symbol, whilst deducing what cards maybe held by opponents from their priests/virgin holdings and/or inca placements. (Yet the latter may be difficult to do, especially as the game even with 5 runs at a clip, and such analysis will stall proceedings). 

I no longer think you should focus at the beginning to play according to sacrifice cards held, rather get the priests/virgins then sacrifice to increase and modify your cards then play to boost your vps. Doing the former leaves you too open to luck of the draw.

The game then builds upto a climax as it seems in every game there will be two interested parties wanting to sway the game in their favour: the "priest" player(s) who want the Spaniards to invade (as they hold the most gold) or the "inca" player(s) who are anti-Spaniards. So you have the player(s) either wanting the days to end quickly or those who want to exhaust the priest/virgin tiles or sacrifice deck. It appears now that fundamentally the game is a balancing act as there are so many contrary actions ('priest' players don't want to exhaust the priests pile or the sacrifice deck), with a player imposed time-pressure ending the day, which coupled with the imposed vp objectives made the last session exciting.

However, I'm not sure if the game is suitable for a family audience as despite easy to play and pick up (though there are some counter-intuitive rules that are often overlooked), mechanically there is alot going on: selling/buying rules, scout movement and payouts, day ending conditions and night resolutions. Also the main complaint is that although the game is interesting and at times tense, it is not a fun game so I don't think it will rate higher than a 7. Also working out you vp is alittle cumbersome and anti-climatic, and I feel I need to implement a reveal rule for the scoring i.e. each player in turn plays a sacrifice card and moves their prince up (and an inca for gold if necessary), increasing a more dramatic game end.

Plays better with 2 than Hamburgum(no zero sum problem). However, I found it too chaotic with more players. I am lukewarm on the game.

It feels like it has too many bells and whistles for its own good. Did it really need a commodity market, for instance? I’m not sure the ‘draw 3, discard 2’ mechanic does enough to mitigate the chunky scoring either, especially in the event of a Spanish conquest which can see one gold here or there deciding the game.

RATING: 4
Second play less impressed because of scoring conditions. Assuming everyone plays equally and grabs his share of the scoring cards which is reasonable to assume given the winning conditions, the winner will be determined by random card draw because he drew more gold symbols then the others.

If one guy falls out of it for whatever reason and tries to push for the second winning condition to flip the tables I'm not sure he will have enough to make a difference to the outcome.

I don't like games where the winner is determined by random card draw. In our second game J and I played differently from K and A. They grabbed the most scoring cards. Who won? They both had the same number of cards but Alfred had one extra statue. So did he win because he was the better player? No, he won because he drew better cards than K. Yeah, really lame!

Played at Essen 2008. Bought my copy & got it signed by Mac Gerdts. Very nice chap!

Really liked this one from the get go. Takes one play to get to grips with how it all works & it works very well. Have played with 2 & 4 players & works very well with both.

Use your prince to activate workers or actions around Machu Picchu in order to add workers, gain resources ,priests, virgins or make sacrifices. The sacrifices move your man up the Inca trail where you get rewards from the sun god which translate to victory points relating to the areas your workers may be in or to the number of priests/virgins you have.

Usually results in close scoring, but beware the possible Spanish conquest endgame. This can result in triple multiplication of the points of the player with the most gold, double for second place, to offer the Spanish. An interesting possible twist that is hard to prepare much in advance for.

Really good game.

Not my favorite Gerdts game by a long stretch, but not bad in its own right. Some of the mechanics aren't very intuitive and the terminology is hard to link to the actions at first. A better written rulebook would go a long way. It can be very satisfying traveling around the board and timing actions just right, but I think the core of the game is too basic for how potentially clumsy the whole process is.

Another winner from Mac Gerdts, featuring a somewhat-disguised variation of his famous rondel mechanic. Also has another Gerdts  trademark: you don't do too much on any given turn, so play goes quickly and with little downtime. Not sure yet, but we think it may play better with fewer people. Five players was awfully crowded and left little room to maneuver. Plays great with two!

RATING: N/A
Turn resources into VPs, but do it WHILE building your engine, which might also score you points. I dunno. A fairly simple game when all is said and done, which is not a bad thing. The board and pieces are cute and there is a bit to think about. I'm not sure how much depth there is to think about long-term vs just drawing the right cards. Turn order also seems crucial and only partly controllable. Feels like it needs another round of development, though the basic idea is sound.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Goods acquisition/production and exchange along with a race element for VP cards with missions/goals. Action selection on a rondel-like board.

The game can end in one of two ways: if all tiles are collected before the end of day 9, Macchu Picchu is saved and victory pints are tallied by mutiplying player workers with the effective location-missions on their tiles; but otherwise the Spanish have discovered Macchu Picchu, making gold much more important and a key multiplier for the wealthiest players' final point tally.

Mac Gerdts is a great designer.

This game is a fun resource management game that has a tense feel to it because you can really push the tempo of it if you want or need to.  Different than any other resource management because there is a lot of unknowns but also can have a deduction feel to it.  Granted there is some luck of the cards but it seems that it's not too much of a factor unless you let the Spanish take over.

This is the kind of game I really like.
Worker placement, gathering goods, trading, nice theme.
The only thing I liked a bit less, are the graphics of the board.
When playing it upside down, I lost a bit of the connection with the theme.
After our first game, I noticed we did some things wrong, like forgetting the first sacrefice card at start up.
So we have to give it another try.

Can't resist wooden llamas!!! I've finally cracked and bought it. A few games in and I'm not sure whether it will stand the test of time or not. A source of dissatisfaction is the luck-of-the-draw element (especially as the 1st card is random). I've tried a 'waiting' game, seeing what everyone else is collecting before starting to build up in a particular area in anticipation of the cards - and it almost worked. Keep feeling it could do with one more round so may try that some time.

--Feb2009-- Why am I susceptible to these acquire stuff to acquire other stuff games?  I'm not quite sure.  This one is a nice instance of that genre:  the tradeoffs for acquiring one sort of item against another are interesting; there are a couple different victory conditions that must be considered; the theme is original; it doesn't overstay its welcome.  On the other hand, that's damning with faint praise when one would prefer only to play truly excellent games.  Still, I'll be happy to play it again.

I can see that this game is cool, but I really don't like it. Fact is, the 2 times I have played, the game ended with the Spanish conquering and the game was completely decided by the draw of the sacrifice cards. Unlucky draws (which I got in the second game) with small money or lucky draws with big money basically decided the game. I did not feel like the moves I made made much of a strategic difference to the ending of the game.

RATING: 7
Solid economic game along the lines of Hamburgum, but with a more variable points reward in the form of cards rewarding investment in certain commodities. The map connections can be a little hard to view, so make sure you get those worked out before you play. There's a bit of last minute scoring control adjustment possible with the card swap. The whole scoring feels a bit weird with cards rewarding massive specialisation, but there's some nice tension possible with the arrival of the Spanish and the scoring bonus - maybe as a catch up mechanism? Certainly specialisation an a gold bonus would be the only way I can see the score needing the whole use of the scoring track. Anyway, the game ticks along nicely and it's light and fun. I like the way the path up the mountain drives you, but at the same time you have a range of options how you'll get those steps. I like how the game rewards early sacrifices and the value decreases as players acquire their priests and virgins.

It's all just another variant of the usual Marc Gerdts offering, so if you own Hamburgum or Navigador or Concordia or this you probably only need one in your collection, but they're just different enough that it's still nice to play them all. Another Marc Gerdts game I'm happy to play.

RATING: 9
Tentative rating until I can figure out whether the end-game scoring is completely out of whack. The game is fascinating and tension-filled. Just like with his other rondel games, I feel like I'm playing catch-up--only this time the rondel is the whole board itself, which is just awesome. 

Some didn't like the artwork, but I did--or at least the layout. I can't wait to play this again. 

Update: Okay, played again and I'm starting to think this might be one of the greats. I can't stop thinking about it, and I want to play again RIGHT NOW to try a different strategy. From an 8 to a 9.

Ok, let me start by saying that I love rondels and this is essentially a rondel, albeit an weirdly-designed one.  I also like Gerdts's Navegador.  Also, I was enjoying PoMP throughout the 2 hours of play (it seemed to run really long for the type of game it is).  Then came the scoring.  Let me just say that if the conquistadors win and it comes down to gold, it's essentially going to boil down to whoever gets the triple scoring.  If you are playing correctly, and you get the triple scoring, you are going to win.  And how is that determined - by card draw.  Whoever has the most gold on their cards at the end gets the triple score.  I hate that about this game and it left such a sour taste in my mouth that I doubt that I will be keeping my copy.

Great take on the rondel system.  I am a big fan of movement in Euro games.  This is a wonderful relief from just placing a "worker" where you want to go.  This has a tough little economic engine.  

There are some great timing decisions to make as you don't know what is going to be available. Quite a satisfying play. 

It is a shame that the art on the board removes you from the time and place.  It is hard to read and looks like it is from some crazy futuristic Sci-fi game. I'm not sure if I would play this with more than three players though...

The rondel mechanic is nicely hidden and adapted to this resource management delight of a game.  It is fairly thematic; you have a feel that you're spending some time walking around the city of Machu Pichu.  The theme also helps to make sense out of the complex interplay of the resources. I enjoy how the resources build upon each other in order to get the Sacrifice Cards, which ultimately drive your victory points.  An enjoyable two-hour Euro with solid game weight.  As an added bonus, this plays quite well with two, although it's best with four or five.

After 1 play ...

Mechanically, a relatively straightforward game -- but it still took us about an hour to go through the rules! It's similar to his other games, but probably different enough to warrant owning it. Instead of choosing your actions by moving around the rondel, you choose them by moving your prince around the board. The economy here consists of acquiring stuff (mostly via workers) which you use to buy priests which accept sacrifices which moves your scout up the mountain path, which gets you sacrifice cards which give you multipliers for having workers/priests of specific types when the game ends. The twist is that there can be a big swing in VP (2x and 3x multipliers!) if the alternate end-condition (Cortez attacking) comes into play. Not sure yet if that's a viable path -- rushing the end to get the multiplier -- since it seems like that'll result in you getting few VP cards to multiply anyway!

--- Summary ---
Players start with 1 of all 5 resources (use 3-corn token), and 1 Inca in any region. Place prince in a region (and activate) on first turn. Each Day round begins with adding a bonus to each of the 4 temples and 5 production areas (use the 3-corn), max 2 bonuses/region. Then, on your turn, either move the prince into a different region (adjacent for free; discard llama to go anywhere) and activate it, or don't move and take a moon token instead (when 3rd moon taken, also take Sun token; also triggers end of round --> each OTHER player gets 1 final action, then go to Night). Prince may activate production region only if it has any bonuses in it: take the bonus, then Incas in the region may produce appropriate material. If activating temples, players with appropriate priests or virgins may sacrifice (1 llama per appropriate priest/virgin, or goods at Main Temple) for appropriate steps to move on path up the mountain (get a 3-corn if land/pass step 7; a llama if land/pass step 12; draw sacrifice cards if land/pass step 20). Royal Palace and Watchmen's Tower allows prince to deploy workers into production areas (max 1/region/turn). Sun Temple allows you to pull workers out of locations; will collect 3 different resources/Inca removed during Night phase. Central Market allows you to buy/sell to the market (may first add or remove 1 item). In Night phase, player going last gets 1 free 1-corn. Then players turn in Moons for appropriate bonus. Incas in Sun Temple are removed now and players collect their bonuses.

When drawing sacrifice cards: add 3 to hand, then return any 2 from hand to bottom of deck.

Game ends immediately if all priests and virgins bought, or after 9th Day round. Players get VP based on the # Incas and priests they have x # matching symbols on their sacrifice cards. If game ending after 9th round, count sum of gold statues on sacrifice cards; players with most and 2nd most multiply their VP by 3 and 2, respectively (generous ties). Most VP wins.

This is the first time I rate a prototype and I'm only doing this because I really think that this is an excelent game that everybody should try.

I've playtested this game (spielportugal) and it is really clever, as usual. This time the game doesn't have a rondel instead a prince moves from place to place taking actions.

The victory conditions are very well balanced and so are the resources/production mechanisms.

The thematic is very well implemented also.

It's very close to be done and I know that lots of people are going to love this game. Playable within the 90 minute range it's very well balanced, elegant and very tense and fun at the end.


Edit: after its release I have to say (sorry Mac :)) that I don't like the way the game ends and the final scoring. It happens that the way we play it in our group the spanish win almost everytime. And the final triple scoring of the biggest traitor makes the game very unfair. We have to think in some variants to use. Until then and the way the game is by now I rate it a 7.

Odd little game from Mac Gerdts with a number of unique mechanisms hiding behind the worst box art I have ever seen.

The deployment of Inca discs for production as well as scoring adds a minor but pleasant element of incentive management, and the bizarre scoring adds another level of tension. If the game ends by tile or card exhaustion it is scored normally; if it ends on time, the player with the most gold (all scoring cards show a gold amount, more gold on cards harder to score points with) triples their score and second-most doubles theirs.

It's hard to imagine there are many cases where the triple score would not be decisive, so the late game sees the kind of ominous frisson you see in semi-cooperative games as players pursue their competing agendas for the end-condition. But while this is undoubtedly exciting, there is enough randomness to the drawing of cards with high/low gold -- where a difference of 1 could be vast -- that it can easily seem capricious.

I don't know whether the game was too thick, or I was (probably the latter). Anyway, it took me almost a full game before I really understood how the game worked. I wonder if it had alot to do with the board, which is an almost indecipherable nightmare. I found the iconography to be lacking and the map had no real sense of place or geography. I can take this action *here* but not *there* -- because the map says so. Perhaps I'm nitpicking, but this abstraction seemed to be an unnecessary liability.

Once I understood the game, I liked it better, but not enough for it to be a favorite.

At the start we had a rough time figuring out the actual end scoring and what we had to do to get there.  As we played we figured out the micro managing of the system and slowly made progress.  I finally figured out the scoring was majority based and plowed full steam ahead.  It's a good game of economic conversion and moves rather quickly once you have a strategy.  All the turns are very, very short.  If there is not too much AP it should move briskly.  In the end it's long just because of the process of constantly reacquiring supplies.

I love [person=6045][/person]! He seems incapable of releasing crappy games! That being said, I don't own all his games. And this is one of those that I don't own. I don't know why I never got it, but I guess I wasn't sure yet about Gerdts when it came out.
Now, having finally played it, I must also say that this is one of the least interesting games he has done. That is a first impression mind you, but I think there is a good reason for thinking that: there is only one way to score points: having the cards that give you points. Gaining those cards than only be done in one way: having virgins and priests and using those to offer llamas to the gods. This makes the game more one-dimentional than most of Gerdts other games.
This is a very solid game, but not up there with [thing=124361][/thing], [thing=66589][/thing] or [thing=24181][/thing].

It's hard to balance between all the actions you should do. "If I do this, I don't have enough corn to do that. Or if I sacrifice these goods now, I won't be able to place more incas, but if I don't, then I won't advance on the inca trail and I won't get more cards. But then again, I need those incas, so I could produce more next turn, but hey, still not enough corn and I would really need those goods to buy priests too..."  

I like games which involve thinking and decision making. I like this game. And it's not every day you get to say "hey, I'll sell some coca leafs". :)

Does not work with 5 players. You hardly get any cards and that makes the luck of card drawing too big for my taste. Also conquer is very likely, no tension there.

Mac Gerdts is certainly in the top 5 of my favorite game designers. His games are straight forward but still tense and gut wrenching. This one is probably my least favorite of his titles so far not sure how he got off track and in fact I at first thought this was prior to Imperial but have since been corrected about that. Still it's an interesting game and there's some fascinating things going on.

Another great game by Mac Gerdts. Production value is very high with a lot of wooden components. The game this time does not have a rondel. But it has a board that acts like a rondel. The game rules are simple for each area of the city, but extremely interconnected and with a lot of balance. The ice in the cake is the scoring mechanism with the two different endings. This alone is a gem. Many people will criticize the 2 different endings, but they add so much more strategy to this game.
The only issue is that this game is only for players that like to play games like Caylus or Byzantium. In complexity (although simple rules) it is above Antike, Imperial, and Hampurgum.
Go and get a copy!

It's a fairly straightforward game where you move to a contiguous space on the board and get the stuff/do the thing there and a bunch of spaces give bonuses to first player in. You spend resources to further your production abilities or get priests. Priests let you sacrifice stuff to run up the mountain, which gives you some stuff but mostly let's you add vp condition cards to your hand. The vp conditions are tied to which production abilities/priests you have. You draw three and return any two. So running the mountain often lets you craft a hand geared towards whatever you want. There's som funky stuff with teleporting llamas and taking moon tiles to end the day. I enjoyed it but I'm not going to be pining to play again.

Good game but too "patchy". It feels like too many mechanics just to make the game work. Could be a masterpiece otherwise.

Very much fun Mac Gerdts game, no action rondell but the map serves the same purpose.  The VP goal is mostly dependent on acquisition of cards only attainable by completing runs by your scout on the Inca Trail.  Figuring out how to grow your resources and speed your scouts' travels is key.  Everyone seems to really like this game, it's likely to come out again and again.

Great bits!! Many favorite games come with camels, this one has LLAMAS!!! Also, shirts, pots, Coca leaves and CORN (which is the primary medium of exchange, no currency.)

(Also see Antike, Imperial, and Hamburgum.)

When the Spaniards conquered the Incan Empire, only a few princes managed to flee into the mountains. Well-hidden high above the river Urabumba is a place the Spanish would never discover: The lost city of Machu Picchu. But beware! Is there a traitor among the princes, ready to reveal the location of the secret city to the Spaniards?

Each player represents an Incan prince, whose workers will grow corn, feed llamas, plant coca, and manufacture ceramics and cloth. They try to engage Priests of the Condor, Priests of the Puma, and Virgins of the Sun. The game can end in 2 different ways:
either the Incans win by activating all priests and virgins in time,
or the Spaniards win when they discover Machu Picchu.
With an Incan victory, the prince who made the wisest sacrifices to the gods will win. With a Spanish victory, the princes who accumulated the most gold will get a multiplier to their score... but it may not be enough to win the game.

Players choose their actions by walking around with their prince on the city map.

Oooooooooooooooooooo!  I spent Xmas '99 exploring the Urubamba valley.  And even after having seen Kransnaya Ploschad, Venetia in the spring, and sunrise in the Alps, Machu Picchu [i]still[/i] took my breath away.  In short: I must have this game.

THIS, this, THIS, is what happens when you marry a neat theme to a decent game, but without really matching the game and mechanics.  Ugh.  I understood the game after reading the rules several times, and playing through it, but even though I did fairly well - I despised it.  NOT FUN.

After having playing Gerdt's Navegador, I much prefer this game instead. While the game has a "rondel", it is not really similar to the rondel of actions found on Navegador. Princes can move back and forth on the map and can jump from one area to the next by sacrificing a llama. So, in the strictest of sense, this is not a rondel game. The wooden components are wonderful, solid and quite large. The map is bright and huge, but the districts could be drawn with better layout or contrast. It is tough to differentiate the borders between districts.

I enjoyed the tension of an alternate ending of the Spanish invasion. It turns the game upside down and allows folks to pursue different paths to victory. Though, a Spanish invasion doesn't mean automatic victory for the person with the most gold as you still need a strong base score to take advantage of the triple multiplier. The Inca track is neat as it is the only way scoring/sacrifice cards can be obtained. Unlike other scoring tracks, one has to work hard to move the runner up the hill to get the scoring cards. This is opposite from all the point salad designs that have proliferated recently.  Actions are also tight in that you can visit a district to collect a good and claim the bonus, but by doing so, you also allow all players with a worker in the district to cash in and purchase the goods. So, all actions should be meaningful and purposeful and not out of convenience (or greed). Every action you take will also contribute to the welfare of others.

Thematically, I think the game is less pasted on that other Euros. It makes sense that Incans princes are working together but also against each other to hide Macchu Picchu from the invaders and that ultimately, enough priests and virgins need to be recruited to obscure the capital. 

There is one small mechanism I particularly enjoy and don't see it implemented in other games: Being able to  swap new scoring cards with previously collected cards. This allows you to change your strategies half way through with scoring and dump cards that are no longer beneficial. Surprisingly, I don't see it often in other games.

A successful evolution of the rondel. I enjoy having a map to move around on, and the game is interesting in a typically euro way. The board and the art are rather hideous, although the bits are nice. I wouldn't want to play with 5 again.

Moderately inelegant, with a handful of awkward small rules to remember.  The economic engine is nothing terribly special, but functions well-enough, with some rough trade-offs to decide between and planning ahead to not waste movement much.

Scoring is potentially very swingy and kind of insane - both with some luck in the cards you get, and the variable final scoring condition.  1 gold can be the difference between 1st place or 5th, and getting that one gold can easily be effectively random happenstance.

The board is also pretty poorly designed visually, but this doesn't relevant impede gameplay.

I also recommend not playing with 5 - it adds chaos and downtime with no real benefit.

The scoring rules are at first blush controversial, but they work once everyone at the table is experienced enough to understand when they should push for the Inca vs Spanish victory. Unfortunately in our era of people only playing a game once or twice, Machu has gotten a relatively chilly reception due to the fact so few give it the repeat plays it necessitates to really shine.

Pretty brain-burner.  Economics were pretty harsh when two players were sharing the resources - could be pretty brutal with more.

The dual endgame is pretty important - has a huge impact on score.

A resource management game but felt it had quite a lot of depth to it. Not sure about the value of second way of calculating victory points - it made no difference other than widening the gap - maybe future plays would prove different. Excellent producion and a good theme.

Played with 3.  Interesting game.  I like the components and graphics more than others it seems.  May go down a little on future plays, but probably won't go up.  While it is a good game, it has that distinct Euromash feeling - lots of mechanics with a slight shortage of heart.

I liked it better the second time, but am leaving rating the same as I'm not sure that the gold scoring works right (or at all).  How often does this game end in Spaniards winning?  If it is the "natural" ending, then the game doesn't really work well because the strategy is to get lucky and draw big gold value cards.

Overall, my favorite of the card/set-collecting worker placement games (Egizia, Stone Age, etc). In particular, it doesn't feel nearly as broken as the Stone Age exponential multiplier. When I explain it to people, I think of it as a cross between Notre Dame and Stone Age with a very slight supply/demand aspect. In the end, this style of game (the card collecting) isn't quite my thing and I'd much rather play a worker placement game that's more head-to-head (Carson City) or something more polished (Le Havre).

I had not heard about this game but recently received it as a Christmas gift. Given the designer's pedigree (Concordia, Navegador) and how much I love those games, I've very intrigued with this one and how Mac Gerdts will implement the "rondel" mechanic. Each game that I've played has used it in very different ways and they have all been great. The fact that there are variable win conditions here and it seems like it could be a more punishing game... just makes it that much more interesting. Hopefully I'm able to try it out soon.

Player interaction is moderately high as all players get to partake in the action taking when a particular player visits a location. However, the game is a little bit thin on the theme. Artwork is average but the game components are very nice, in particular the wooden components.

Totally misunderstood the endgame scoring.  I had thought that in a Spanish Conquest only the gold on the sacrifice cards would count as points, so since I had fallen behind on the production building, I decided I would take a different approach by pushing the mountain track to collect as much gold as possible and accelerating the day/night cycle.  Unfortunately, I later found out the gold only served to award you a multiplier if you have the most.  You still need the Inca tokens in the appropriate districts as well as the virgins and priests in order to receive points.

With that said, I still enjoyed the game quite a bit.  The movement around the board is much more flexible than the rondel system in Gerdts' previous design.  Careful planning is often required as certain city spots become less desirable once someone else has already landed on it.  You also do not want to give people the chance to produce and/or sacrifice if it will benefit them more.  I'm not sure if I like the magical llama which allows a Prince to enter any district, it seems like a tactic that can be easily abused.  I'm also kind of ambivalent on how turn order is determined, it feels far too chancy to be something you can arrange to happen intentionally.

Tus trabajadores cosechan maiz y coca, cuidan llamas y hacen ropa y cerámicas. Deberás hacer sacrificios en los templos para obtener el favor de los dioses. Quien cumpla mejor sus cartas ocultas obteniendo más PV ganará (a menos que los españoles logren conquistarlos y gane quien tenga más oro).

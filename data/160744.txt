The production values and concept of this game are quite nice. It feels original in several ways: the landing/movement of your delivery actions, the pacing of the game in two distinct haves - split neatly in half by the game board design. But it doesn't play in an interesting enough way somehow. I think this is mainly due to the hand management and card play - it is forced into the design. The special powers on the cards are also awkward. And the recipe system has a run-away-leader feeling. Over all, rather average in my estimation.

An interesting puzzle.  Essentially a resource conversion/action optimization game, you need to plan how to use your limited actions to have the required resources on your ships to purchase goods and upgrade your ships.

Plays in about 20-30 minutes as offers a good solo challenge.

Lovely art, and the theme was top-notch.  There can be some problems with runaway leader - your options in the second half of the game are only as strong as what you were able to do in the first half.

Ultimately, this game is a hodgepodge of different mechanisms, which produces something quite unique. On one hand, you have Uwe Rosenberg's resource conversion... and there is a lot of it; players will need to move resources 4x, by the end of the game, in order for those products to score. On the other hand, you have a strong abstract element with the rondel; players attempt to maximize their efficiently while gaining the right station bonuses to optimize their turn. And lastly, you have a bit of an American-style element with the die and special powers of the aliens. 

Now typically, whenever their is dice-rolling in a game, I tend to be fairly critical. But honestly, I'm not sure how influential the luck is in this game. For instance, players can mitigate the die by not rolling it (and thus using its current value) and by bribing. But even if a player gets lucky and is able to transport a massive amount of goods, chances are it won't be much use; that's because players can usually only transport to one thing, and everything has a transportation capacity. 

Furthermore, the rondel mechanism has an almost ingenious synergy that balances each turn. For example, if you land a shuttle (transporting goods to the station) and it takes a long time to land (shuttle spaces are filled), you will have a high transportation capacity. But if there are tons of shuttles, that means players (including you) have already transported to the station. Which means, you are probably already close to capacity. Thus, transportation become less useful to players as the action becomes more powerful. 

Finally, because of the abstract/tactical nature of the game, I suspect it plays best with 2-players. But ultimately, this game is unique, brain-burning, and has a very high production quality.

More than anything else, what strikes me about this game is just how drop-dead gorgeous it all is.  When it's set up, it really is a work of art.  

The aesthetic appeal admittedly takes a toll on the ease of setup, since there are a bunch of pieces to place together, but it's not that big of a deal. I agree with the critique that it *could* have just been a board, but I don't think that we have to make a federal case out of it... again, the modular board gives the game a unique and attractive look.  If you think you'll be playing the game often, consider getting about eight itty-bitty containers to hold each type of good--there are six each of eight different types of goods, and after you select which goods will be in the game, you have to dig through a pile of 48 identically-colored tokens to find the goods you're going to use.  

Still, once it's all set up and ready to go, the game moves quicker than you might think.  It's true that you can't really plan ahead on your turn (because your eventual action is based on the placement of ships by other players, the available/most advantageous actions aren't apparent until it's your turn), but this is remedied by giving you a maximum of only three options each turn and limiting you to a single action.  So, decisions are easy to make and turns move fast.  The mechanics are not thematic, but that doesn't make them any more difficult to understand--you play a numbered card and, if the space matching that number is already occupied, you leapfrog to the next available space.  The number of spaces you bounced at and the one you finally land in is the number of tokens you can move from one place to another.  It's pretty simple, and the rules are well-written with a bunch of visual examples.

The game is split into two halves, wherein the first is focused on cultivation, and the second if focused on the harvest.  I greatly enjoyed the gameplay during both halves of the game, but I disliked the limitations of the second half.  If I can get really reductive for a moment, the second half sometimes felt like an extended "End Game & Scoring" section--after planting your seeds during the first half of the game, the second half essentially has you counting up and selling your crops.  If you're neck-and-neck with your opponents, then this is fun and exciting.  But if one player falls behind in the first half, it might be a tall order to ask that person to patiently go through the motions after it's clear victory is impossible--even if someone with fewer resources is able to charge all their products and upgrade their freighters, the final scores in both of the games I played were commensurate with the resource count at the end of the first half.
 
Despite that complaint, I still really enjoyed the game and look forward to more plays with more players.  Happy to own it!  Acquired via Kickstarter.

This is the same game publisher that made Ophir. I read about FSF during the Ophir campaign and while I was waiting on the delivery of Ophir the FSF campaign was started up. I basically backed this game on Kickstarter because of Ophir. 
I gave this game chance even after watching Tom Vasel's review, but in the end (or not since didn't even finish the game) I had to agree with Tom on what he thought about this game. Some people will enjoy playing this game, but it is just not for me.

The logistics conundrums (packing and transit) in this game are interesting, as is the tension over how much cargo-space to bring to station B (given that more cargo is good, and spaceships let you bring more pilots which provide more and better actions at B, but each additional ship can cost you up to 4 points if not-full and un-upgraded).

But the action selection - at least with 4p - was too chaotic for my tastes; you [i]could[/i] plan, but only in a very loose/heuristic sort of way.

I found Station B more engaging than Station A; it's great  that the game includes rules for playing either half on its own. {101}

This game is one that is often misunderstood. 
Better 2 player

It is a one of a kind however it takes 3 plays at least to adjust to the genius in the Rondel mechanic

This game has the resource mechanic and complexity of strategy of Agricola in a 45min Play time

I would give it 10/10 but it just isn't that great on 3+ players. Which I don't play much so not a big issue

Far Space Foundry is a superb, challenging puzzle of a game. It is incredibly variable and offers numerous routes to victory. I've gone from thinking it was interesting, to thinking it was great, to thinking it is an absolute favorite in the space of 4 games. This one demands several plays,but once you get started, you won't want to stop... At least I don't. I'll be playing this on a daily basis for the next couple of weeks.

The expansion material is great fun too! All in all, a gem!!!! The precious purple kind!!!

In Far Space Foundry, players spend the first half of the game trying to collect resources and load them on their transports, and the second half trying to unload those resources, upgrade both the resources and the transports, and then reload everything.  This is done by playing number cards that correspond to docks in the station, and depending on whether you're coming or going, the amount you have to travel from that dock determines the number of goods you get to transport.  You have absolutely no control over which docks will be occupied from one turn to the next, which makes this almost entirely a tactical exercise.  I didn't like how the Commander die worked--in most turns you choose a number card and use that, but rolling the die and essentially choosing a random number doesn't often feel like a good alternative.  Additionally, I wish there was some pre-seeding of the board before each half of the game; with the board empty it really feels like the first player always gets screwed the most.  On the whole, though, it's an interesting tactical puzzle.

Not for me. I can see why people like it. You really have to plan accordingly. You can't plan until it is your turn and then you get screwed. Might be better with 2 or 3p but with 4p way too chaotic and not of my taste. I think they did a great job with the art and components but game play was overly complicated for something that should be simple. Too fiddly. I won't be seeking out another play of this.

The solo game is even more mathy, although there is enough imperfect information to avoid it from being solvable.

I had to look at the box three or four times to make sure this wasn't a Stefan Feld game. Far Space Foundary manages to deliver on its theme of space mining and shipping fairly well, yet the primary mechanism that drives it is pure number game nonsense. You play a card with a numerical rating then either count the empty spaces in front of it or behind it, depending on what you are trying to accomplish. That number determines the strength of your action. On top of that the games has storage limitations on all of your goods, adding a bit of complication to figuring out what card to play and which way to count so you aren't being wasteful.

It's a fine game that demands a ton of concentration and forward planning to play well. Unfortunately, I didn't find all that work to be very fulfilling when it was all said and done. It feels good to precisely ship exactly what you need or to fire off your manufacturing plants a turn before everyone else, yet none of it really feels like a mining or logistics game. Rather it just felt like counting to six and moving a chit, over and over and over again.

I know I am being too harsh on this, because it is not too long and I did get a good brain burn out of it. I guess it simply didn't fire my imagination as much as I had hoped it would. Besides, when I am spending all of my time playing it actually thinking about other games, that tells me this simply isn't a game for me, for whatever reason.

Far Space Federation in a peacekeeping mission needs supplies in a pickup and deliver logistics game at the space foundry hub. There are two main game phases that begins with production and delivery and ends with finished goods conversion and distribution. Production involves extracting crystals and ore from the red and blue moons and optionally processing them into purple metal. Contract with pilots and freight ships for loading and delivery from the foundry to the warehouses. In the second phase, activate robots to complete random recipes cards using stock from the warehouse and fabricate finished goods.  In both phases, players play cards from identical numbered decks to activate different actions in the hub.

The finest tactical game on WWII desert warfare. Gives an excellent insight to what desert tank battles was in WWII. Contains small - to large sized battles. Lots of tanks and armor. Get all the expansions and you have 96 scenarios!

An excellent tactical gaming system. Streamlined and playable. Very deep research evident in the system. Casualty-based infantry combat system. One of the few systems where the armor rules and the infantry rules actually work together pretty seamlessly.

RATING: 9
The milestone of a new kind of tactical gaming. This system is what I've been looking for since I came back to wargaming. Detailed, strictly historical, fast and fun, with tons of modules covering almost every theatre of WWII, with special attention to less known though highly interesting battles. 
ATS was born here, in the desert, were his full potential is displayed in a seemingly endless flow of scenarios, historically well researched, balanced and fun to play.

RATING: 6.5
edit:  Not sure the status of ATS anymore.  Seems like Critical Hit has abandoned most of ATS for a newer version.  Not sure if the latest version is backward compatible.

Wanted it to be an update of Tobruk.  Turned out to be a reasonably successful attempt to simplify ASL.  I like the armor rules.  For the infantry game, the impulse system allows you to react on the fly, but in my opinion, takes away the feeling of a plan.  I seem to revise my plans impulse to impulse.

Entire game in a box concept makes you buy many components over and over.

Great maps!  But if you are into ASL, they port all the modules to an ASL compatible module.

As an AFV game I give it an 8 as an infantry game i give it a 6. 
This system is enough complete and complex to let you game big tactical battles, and you can complete them in a manageble amout of time.
Try the big tank battles and let infantry where it belongs (to ASL).
Certainly worth a try.
Confused rulebook and the costant change of rules is rather disappointing element of this system.

RATING: 10
TOBRUK was the first tactical game with high detail in AFV vs AFV mechanism. This and many other concepts were later copyied in Squad Leader. I think the Advanced Tobruk revitalized the genre with simple - yet coherent and crisp - game mechanisms. The somewhat feeble rulebook had since been reworked completely and the ATS range now offers a lot of unique situations and Campaign Games. I even switched from designing and playing ASL material to devoting my efforts to ATS instead...and I have sold all my ASL gear!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
ASL light - in terms of rules and decision-making. The game struck me more as a solitaire system marketed as a two player game. If you play ASL, you will likely feel that something is missing with this adaptation.

RATING: 8
I am definitely a fan of this "style" war game. AT offers just the right amount of complexity to make the game playable without constant reference to the rules. Some minor "bugs" in the first printing of the rules will turn off some of the rules lawyers out there, but all in all, it is a very solid system. Future modules will be based on other fronts of the war besides the desert.

This is a very approachable tactical battle system. It is easy to get into, but has the depth  to keep it viable for years. The production quality and support from Critical Hit are both great.

Interesting and rather bloody squad level tactical system.  Several scenarios and expansions available for Tobruk, and the game system has moved into Europe.  It&#039;s fiddly, but becomes intuitive after a while.  I couldn&#039;t get into ASL, but this I can.

RATING: 7
Flagship game of the ADVANCED TOBRUK SYSTEM/ADVANCED TACTICAL SYSTEM (ATS) which finally saw Critical Hit! refine its COMBAT! system into an effective alternative to ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER.  Best of all, ADVANCED TOBRUK had all those favorite scenarios from the old AH TOBRUK game that many of us grew up on and developed calluses from all that die rolling--thankfully the new system spares us all that.  ADVANCED TOBRUK is not really "ADVANCED" TOBRUK as much as it is a completely redesigned game.  The scale is the same, but instead of the Operations Analysis/Operations Research angle (similar to a miniatures game) it's much more like most of the other squad level game systems we've gotten familiar with.  Lots of scenarios and expansion kits for this game, so you get lots of replayability.  And it sure plays faster than a lot of those old WEST OF ALAMEIN scenarios in ASL!

My favourite tactical system, better than ASL that I know very well and of the majority of the most recent titles on the subject. Graphic is still primitive but rules are accessible and scenarios are balanced and well studied.

RATING: 7
{this is my rating for the whole ATS system, not just Advanced Tobruk}

For the most part I like the ATS game system, especially its armor rules.  The rules are easier to absorb than ASL, the impulse system feels very natural, and AFV combat is well thought out.  I also appreciate that most of the games are self-contained without OOB prerequisites.  About my only dislikes are the dense rulebook (I would prefer more pages, larger font, and more extensive cross references), and burdensome morale check modifiers in congested scenarios.

The quality of the components are hit or miss though.  At least half of the ATS games I've ordered had a missing or damaged component.  This was corrected by CH quickly, but that's not a great track record.  Also, CH seems to change the contents of its games frequently: do not look at a game's BGG image and assume that it is an accurate representation of a game's contents.  On the plus side, all of the box games contain everything needed to play without prerequisites. Kind of like a self-contained HASL.

I love the system, I'm not really fond of the desert war.

RATING: 8
Nice back and forth flow using an impulse system; the decisions come fast and furious.  ATS has a fairly simple, intuitive armor combat system and great components to complement.  ATS is also somewhat compatible with ASL maps and scenarios (if you have the ATS equivalent game pieces).  Make sure you have the latest rules set - the original version leaves a LOT to be desired and forces one to overlook/change some obvious errors.

One knock that is hard to overcome is the markers.  Infantry hit markers are a pain...particularly in stacks.  I would rather have kept infantry units to a 2 hit capacity vs. 4, or added replacement counters for step losses.  Other markers detract from the experience as well, such as moved, fired, etc.  While needed for the system, they're not very attractive.

While this sounds critical, ATS is a very, very good tactical WWII game.

I'm not sure yet, but I think this is becoming as complex as ASL...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While I know I risk the Flames of ASLers, I do prefer ATS to ASL.  It feels lighter, and for tank-v-tank I find the system feels more like what I'd expect in reality.  Small arms combat (pre-4.0) is a little more bloody than ASL, but again, it "feels" right in the end.  I really like the stepped unit approach, versus the clunky half-squad model in ASL.  Command seems a little uninspired, but for a 15 minute firefight, it works.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Complex and detailed, but fluid and easy to learn. Desert rules are easy and let you maneuver around the map.

Pros: Very good AFV combat mechanics; fluid; interactive.

Cons: Difficult; changing game rules. Forget and avoid TT versions of ATS.

PbeM suitability: high, although there's always the possibility of opportunity fire spoiling one's plans. The impulse system would seem to be a problem for email games, but in actuality after the first few each turn you can usually be a bit more flexible and let the attacker do a few on the assumption that the defender will pass.

RATING: 7
This is a fast paced game with interactive turn sequence.  It's easier to learn and play than other tactical wargames.  It comes with a 4 page basic game that allows you to get going within a few minutes of opening the box.  The full rules set is 48 pages and covers all theaters of World War II (north africa, europe, pacific) and all types of combat (infantry, armor, artillery, aircraft, night, etc...)  The 24 scenarios in Advanced Tobruk range from very small (3 armored cars per side) to large, all arms battles lasting 12 turns.  

I think recent (2010 to 2012) changes to the rules have added complexity without any value in game play. Also, the switch to smaller counters in table-top games isn't a great move considering the aging of the wargamer population and the fact that other systems are using larger counters.

The best game in the series to introduce in full Advanced Tobruk System. Three nationalities (UK, German, Italian), 24 scenarios, many of them armor only, where the system really shines. Open ground, where maneuvring it's crucial, and easy terrain rules, without many issues about LOS or variable heights.

Good "light" alternative to ASL. I feel that for tanks battles this game is better than ASL, for infantry is the opposite. You can easly play big battles, and the game is an impulse system so you are always doing something. Great, expecially if you found ASL too much demanding in terms of rules.

RATING: 7
An obvious ASL contender with a far superior sequence of play and brevity of system, but still inferior rules quality (but much improved over the beginnings).

I came to this as an update to the original Tobruk and that system has been massively streamlined, but I'm less convinced by what has been done to the original Tobruk's scenarios. Still, for tank-to-tank combat in the desert (which is what I want) this is certainly vastly better and cheaper than getting into ASL.

This rating is for version 3.0 of the ATS rules.  Not quite ASL, but close.  This boxed set gives you a ton of stuff and a lot of scenarios for battles in North Africa.  Once you get the hang of the rules the various game systems work well.  My only complaint is that at times the clockwork sequence of the game leaves few surprises and it can seem like an exercise in statistics.

Plays very fast and by alternating impulses (in which players may shoot OR move OR move and shoot) keeps both players in the game at all times.    Advanced Tobruk also possesses the smoothest working set of armour combat rules in this genre. Very well put together, well-supported and an excellent value. (See my review for more details.)

A tad more playable system than ASL--which I love. I think I prefer the "impulse" system over the Igo-Ugo system. There are some details and rules that I like in ASL that don't seem to be present in ATS , but ASL can be excessive sometimes. And I think that the ASL rulebook is a better written. Preliminary rating after one play is '8'.

RATING: 8.25
While derided as a 'cheap immitation of ASL', Advanced Tobruk and its modules would be better thought of as an innovative simplification of ASL.  There are clear similarities between the games, however, ATS' use of players alternating impulses (wherein they can move or fire as opposed to ASL's strict "fire phase" / "movement phase" and IGO UGO structure) make these very different games in play style.  Similarly, where a squad in ASL can 'absorb' a great deal of firepower, break, run away and rally to 'full strength', in ATS that squad will very likely have taken real and permanent casualties - a more realistic result, IMO.  Those who refuse to try this game on 'religious' grounds (i.e. it's not ASL!  Ewwww!) are shorting themselves on an enjoyable gaming experience.

RATING: N/A
I don't know what rating I should be giving to Tobruk. If I had to rate the rules included in the game, I'd have to rate it as a full 4: a chaotic unreadable mess full of errors. But CH thought they had a good game at hand, and went on updating the rules to a playable state. The rules became much longer in the process, but much clearer too, and many ugly things disappeared in the meantime (I had a full list of evident bugs found in the first edition, and almost 99% of them were corrected in future revisions of the rules). The system in itself has it strong and its weak points: compared to ASL, pure vehicle engagement play in a much more convincing way, expecially because of the addition of the impulse system and because in Tobruk moving vehicles are not as disadvantaged as moving vehicles in ASL, making the whole "tank in the desert" thing a much more playable scenario. Infantry conversely plays a little bit too fiddly in Tobruk, and all in all, ASL has a much more convincing treatment of infantry: Tobruk play much more like "I'm copying ASL but I'm trying not to appear like it" than a different system, and in the end it's not as fun as ASL when playing infantry... and difficulty-wise it's even harder than ASL in this respect (the fact that I had to read and learn 3 different revision of the same game which dramatically changed some big parts of the rules didn't help). So, in the end, what we get by buying (and playing) Tobruk? A system that plays better with tanks than with infantry, which is not at the same level of ASL when you sum up all its parts, that has a lot of scenario available but much less balanced than the official ASL ones, and with a lot of historical map on which is really good to play on, but which definitely will leave you with the need of a campaign game. In the desert the system shines, exactly where ASL partially fails, but elsewhere ASL is superior in every sense. I have got Advanced Tobruk, and sometimes I think about getting more desert modules for it, but in the end the system is not worth the time investment to learn it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Advanced Tobruk is the tactical system that I have always wanted.  It's detailed, but not overwhelmingly so.  (I never got into ASL because I have limited gaming time and like to play a variety of games).  The game is very interactive and plays well both solitaire and FTF.  The components are very good and the many scenarios range from short infantry or armor only clashes to lengthy combined-arms ones.  The game system works just as well in a dense urban environment as it does in the desert.  ATS provides an excellent narrative and gives good tactical insight. It's interesting to see the differences in weapons systems and how they (along with terrain) shape the battlefield. Be sure to get the most recent rules & charts!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

And you can buy every edition.
Or even buy the same edition every six months, as the rules are changing from the beginning to the end every three months, you get a new game each time.

Some of the low ratings here seem to be based on a review of the old version of the rules.  It is my understanding that the rules have undergone significant clean up.

While the idea of an ASL which treated armor better appealed, this just didn't work for me. It seemed to give slack to the infantry without appreciably bettering the armor game. It also seemed too derivative of ASL.

A really FUN WWII squad level tactical wargame, much easier to learn and play than ASL, but still lacking a bit of the chrome that ASL does so well.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] I loved playing the original Tobruk with my Dad when I was a kid - I'd love to try out this updated, more detailed version.

UPDATE: decided to stick with regular Tobruk. The AT System looks "too similar" to other system games, which we don't need more of (a friend is getting into the Panzer Grenadier system from Avalanche).

UPDATE: I got a copy of an ATS starter kit in a trade, so need to try that out before deciding if I want to get into this system.

UPDATE to end all UPDATES: I think Panzer will fill the spot for a Tobruk replacement for me. I played MBT once way back in the day and liked the system, and from what I hear the new edition of Panzer has all the tactical, detailed armored warfare I want along with a more streamlined, accessible rule set. I think I'll have to leave dreams of ATS behind for now.

This game (system) is, IMNSDHO, the One True Tactical Game.  It's everything ASL could have been:  all the action, more than enough 'realism' for anyone, and only a fraction of the ridiculous mountain of rules.  Make no mistake:  this is not a simple nor an easy game!  They've taken Hal Hock's dice-rolling-frenzy Magnum Opus and streamlined the game flow while sacrificing none of the attention to detail. If you were bitten by the 'broken' rules of the Combat! series of games, you're in luck; they learned their lessons well at Critical Hit.  ATS is a return to the roots of Tobruk, and all the old Combat! games are being (or have been) re-released in the ATS format.  The 2.0 ATS rules (and the master tables) will be available for download within days of my posting this, but you can get 1.95 right now--it's well worth the read.  This isn't just for Desert any more!  Kursk, Omaha Beach, the Scottish Corridor, it's all ATS, folks!  No, I'm not a shill for Critical Hit, nor do I do anything with or for them except buy and play their products.  I play ASL; don't for a second assume I love ATS because ASL is too complex.  It's as I said: ATS is everything ASL could have been had the designers not gotten too carried away with far too many needless and persnickity rules.  Besides, what's not to love in a tactical game that handles armor with as much detail as any miniatures game?  Put that infantry in the back seat, where they belong!  ;-)

All punched, clipped, and in craft/Plano boxes. All ATS titles are being traded together - check my collection for the list of ATS games/expansions. This is a huge collection, so PM me to set up a trade.

Initial release suffered from rulebook problems but this game system has matured to give ASL a run for it's money.  As release a 7 rating but with rulebook fixes up to a 7.5

Enjoyable for smaller armour encounters, but not so much for combined arms

Rating after a couple games. A little complex for my taste but rating may go up when more familiar with the game system

Now on it's third edition (or is it fourth now?), the first game in the ATS series takes Hal Hock's original tactical level desert WW2 game Tobruk and streamlines it for much smoother play. Including the expansion packs, there are now a total of 96 scenarios! Includes two generic desert maps, and overlays that represent the various terrain found in the scenarios.

This is the one that started the Advanced Tobruk System, now known as ATS for short. All the action is at 50 yards a hex scale, with lots of fun tank vs. tank, infantry vs. infantry, and combined arms scenarios.

My favorite tactical system. Not so hard to learn but really tough to master. The detail level is exactly what I was looking for,and the whole range of ATS games allows you to visit many other topics. It's really worth the time spent learning the rules.

My prefered tactic game system. Highly playable, fast. Scenarios with vehicles are better with it.

I have terribly mixed opinions about this game system. I really, really want to like it. As much as I love ASL, I do recognize that it can be pretty obsessive-compulsive at times. And despite ATS' similarities to ASL, there are some genuinely nice innovations (like the morale system for example) as well as many sensible simplifications that should make for a cleaner game that requires less of an investment to play well.

However, I can't escape the feeling that the system is sloppy and unsupported, more concerned with pumping out new material than actually refining the system. The rulebook (I had 3.08) looks halfway-decent at first glance, but closer inspection reveals a number of holes or inconsistencies. After setting up the first scenario, I realized that a couple of rules (on hillocks and FOW) were so unclear that I really didn't know how to sensibly continue. A post at CSW gathered no replies. A post at the company's message board got a response from one player who basically said he didn't know most of the answers and offered a few suppositions (which ended up being contradictory) on the others. Ultimately, I'm going to reluctantly concur with the opinion of my ASL buddies that this system is sloppy and unsupported. And that's a shame, because there clearly is some real potential to the system.

Update: Over a week after my initial questions, and after a slightly pout-y farewell post on my part, some knowledgeable people finally answered my questions. While it was nice of them to do so, it's too late for me with ATS. ASL is more complete and consistent, and has an enormous community of active, supportive players. I see no reason to invest in this system.

This is a vast improvement on the earlier Tobruk, which was a great game itself. The system has been cleaned up considerably and the new mechanisms work very well. Advanced Tobruk has the same nine scenarios from the original Tobruk plus many more.

I like this a good deal better than Squad Leader (a game it resembles in many respects).  Impulse system makes for more player interaction, armor rules are surprisingly fun.  Biggest downside right now is waiting for the 3.0 rules (although the current rules are perfectly playable).

I've never really been interested in ASL but ATS seems like a fun system with managable playtimes. This might rise with future playings!

ATS is a lot of fun. It's more accessable than ASL from a perspective of learning and playing a new game system. As much as I like ASL I've never spent enough time with it to be able to play quickly. ATS is easier and therefore I've been able to jump right in and play. And as a father of two young children I need to be able to just jump right into a game and not spend all night researching rules, etc.

Great tank combat. I have both ASL and ATS but I am currently playing more ATS. This is a placeholder for ATS. I have most ATS releases.

I'm a fan of the original counter pattern and all my boxed games are of that pattern. I'm up for Vassal/Skype play of any modules I own.

Unplayable out of the box due to a poorly-written, poorly-organized rulebook. I recently gave it another try using a newer edition of the rules, but was again stymied by the lack of any discernible logic in the order in which the rules are presented. 

It doesn't help that Critical Hit's customer service is the worst in the hobby.

GAME: Codenames Duet
RANK: 148

RATING: 9
Codenames Duet is my favourite game from the Codenames series.  In the other versions there can be a little downtime as you wait for your turn, but in Codenames Duet you're always fully immersed in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
We like this one even better than regular Codenames due to the fact that there is basically NO downtime. You are both making guesses and crafting clues, so you always have something to think about.

RATING: 8
Codenames Duet is the logical (and I think) complete evolution of the original Codenames game. Now played 2-player, you both get to give clues to each other, simultaneously working on the same board, but with different information. 

Your goal: 15 spies in 9 rounds. You both have 12 spies on your side of the board: 9 in common, 3 unique. You also have 3 assassins: 1 in common, 1 each on neutral, and 1 each on each other's hints! This will mean that some cards can only be guessed by one person or the other. 

This is a great 2-player game, and I believe Duet is more fun than the original. Being the codemaster has always been the best part of this game, and with Duet you both get to be the codemaster at the same time! 

Additionally, Duet offers several challenges (cleverly themed as different destinations on a world map). Some will have you winning in fewer rounds, while others give you fewer missed hints (neutral hints). The whole mechanic of combining neutral players with the round marker is sheer genius. Overall, this is a highly recommended addition to the Codenames family -- we've skipped all the others and only plan to own this one!

(+) Everyone gets to think of clues now, more assassins, variable difficulty, easy to teach, non-gamers LOVE it, price is excellent, different looking agents and civilians was a nice touch, best filler game available

(-) Theme is not really brought out, even though it is the best filler game on the market its rating is capped by a lack of depth that other types of games provide.

Having 3 assassin per side plus shared green cards feels like it adds significant tension to the game.  I think this is a great thing, but the players must understand the rules and truly ignore the clue cards when they are guessing.  Attempting to meta-game didn't seem to end well.

Not something I would own, as my family doesn't enjoy word games as much as I do (and my hints seem to be too niche/weird for most people, oops).

Still, it was quite enjoyable for a binge play session.

When I was left underwhelmed by my first play of Codenames two years ago, little did I suspect the number of versions of the game I would be obliged to play by more enthusiastic friends.  So here is Codenames the coop game, in which two players or teams play both spymaster and codebreakers for each other.  It's no worse than the original.  I look forward to Codenames Dice and Codenames the Deckbuilder.

The copy I played was a prototype, so I won't comment on production quality.

Personally think it's the best version of Codenames I've played so far. Unlike regular Codenames, it's not a party game, since it's just for 2 players, so it avoids the biggest problem of the regular versions, where a supposed party game makes a group of people sit and stare at the table.

The two-player version of the ingenious Codenames takes it into the realm of the very compelling partnership games, with simple small touches to the rules.

Well done!

This version of Codenames is an improvement on the original. The co-operative aspect just feels perfect for this game. Everyone can take a turn being the spymaster, everyone is invested in uncovering the spies, and everyone can feel like they've won. This game can be played with nearly anyone.

An excellent iteration of the original. Now you can legitimately play Codenames as 2p. The only negative is there's effectively a timer mechanic that forces you to get all your clues done by a certain points whereas I enjoy the team-vs-team aspect where you can kinda "go big" or hold back based on how you're doing. On the other hand, the biggest negative with the original is the relatively high downtime for the team that isn't guessing which this pretty much eliminates since you're always either guessing or giving clues. I think I like the original a tiny bit more but really it's worth owning both especially because you can mix the cards.

Really cool twist on the system.  I have always liked Codenames, but I think I like playing this way best.  This is probably more of an expansion that adds a "Co-op" mode than an actual new game, but this was really neat and one of the best 2p games to play from 2017 for sure.

If you like codenames, you'll probably like duet.  The game provides a few different configurations for play with regards to how many turns you get, and how many innocent bystanders you can trip.  These modifications force a strategy adjustment.  We often feel like, as with the base game, the card configuration can often trump ability but the challenge is a fun one regardless.

Codenames Duet is a nice way of playing Codenames with just your partner. It's nice but a) the 2-player only gamma contains amazing games that Codenames can't come near and b) wasn't there already a way of playing regular Codenames with just two players?

Perfect addition to basegame because it plays so well with lower player numbers. The existence of 3 assassin cards per side changes a bit - you have to be more conservative.
Still, I like the considerations of the competitive environment: like which word to explain first or which to spare to make it harder for opponents. That's why I'll give this a 9 for the moment and the original a 10.

My other half and I have thoroughly enjoyed this since picking it up. And it really translates well as a two-player implementation of the base game, losing none of what makes Codenames so brilliant.

This version turns it into a pure co-op game, yet still split into two teams, which is an interesting dynamic I've not seen in co-op games before. The big benefit is that you're not reliant on choosing quarterbacks properly and sometimes excluding less skilled players from having the fun of creating the clue. Plus your side can share in the guilt when you realize you gave a bum clue, rather than having it be one player's fault.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoyed this better than Codenames, and I already enjoyed Codenames.

Duet is a cooperative game where two players or teams sit across from each other, each seeing one side of a key card. So, a word one player might be trying to get their partner to guess might be an assassin on the flip side of the key card. This creates a pretty interesting dynamic in that cards you're trying to avoid your partner guessing actually end up getting successfully covered up and out of play if it's a useful word on your partner's side of the key card. So, threats often get removed as the game progresses.

However, out of the 25 words, each player has three assassins to avoid, so things can be very challenging and risky out of the gate!

There's also a very clever difficulty system which adjusts the number of turns you get to succeed, and also adjusts the impact of accidentally choosing the innocent bystanders.

Overall, I really thought this was an improvement on Codenames, and would probably choose to play this over it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Love the original Codenames and Duet has managed to turn the party game into an excellent 2-player experience. The goal of the game remains the same but I love how the 2 players share some agents and the 3 assassin words on each side of the cards that are different for the other player. Hundreds of new words that can be mixed and matched also add some extra variability, which is always welcomed! Definitely a great option for couples or a couple of friends that may not have access to a big group to play one of the predecessors.

A Codenames version we can play 2-player! When this was announced, I was very hesitant about it, but after trying it at Origins, we had to have it. Part of the reason Paul didn't always enjoy the regular game is that he never felt entirely comfortable as clue-giver, but as we were often teaching, he felt obligated to take on that role. Now we have a really fun way to practice both our clue-giving and guessing!

Oh god are we bad at this.  But still have fun!  It's an interesting co-op, as it feels mainly like regular Codenames at first, but then there are some moments where the overlapping agents/assassins/bystanders come in.  You gave me a hint, but it clearly looks like an assassin on my side... is it an assassin for you?  Or, your hint is an agent - are we sharing it?  Or do I have the hint wrong?  This, plus the fact that there are non-overlapping agents, makes for a very fun co-op experience.

This is such a welcome version of Codenames.  With the original, I mostly played with two teams of two, just because I'm not usually in larger game groups.  I have played with teams of 3, which makes it more of a "party game".  

This one is very easy to break out with anyone.  It is highly challenging and fun.  Each player is more actively involved in the game because they are playing both sides (clue-giver and guesser).  

I have a terrible win-loss record, but the vast majority of games came down to the very end.  Very addictive and fun.  

(I didn't see the point in using the map variant.  But that's not to say it's bad.  Maybe I'll try it.)

Nice, two player cooperative variant of Codenames.  Players are capped to a limited number of turns, and are using a two sided key card that each features 9 agents to identify.  Clever touches include three assassins on each side, and the ability to deduce through the common shared rules on the key cards.  I really enjoyed this version of the game - possibly more than the original.

Younger brother of Codenames, mainly for two to play cooperatively but more are welcome as well. It has some different strategic points, like deducing overlapping assassin and agents. Pretty cool game for a quick brain exercise for couples. Also map of the world to use for a mini campaign by traveling through the connected cities with variable difficulty assignments is a very nice touch.

2017-11-11 : First play. Played it as a 4-player and though this is listed as a co-operative game this immediately turned into a competition between the 2 sides to see who would be first to find "their" nine words. In essence just a variant on Codenames, but a good one if you only have 2 players. With 4 I'd rather play the original game.

Codenames Duet is a 2-player cooperative game that's much more satisfying than the 2-player variant that comes in normal Codenames. You can play with more people and have teams, but I think I'd prefer playing competitively at that point. This is easier for me to get to the table and also has the benefit of each player being both a guesser and clue-giver. I guess people who aren't comfortable/dislike giving clues will enjoy this version less, but for me it's nice to get to do both. Even if you aren't interested in this as a cooperative game, there are 400 new (and more difficult) words that can be used as an expansion to your base game. The unique key-grid allows for deduction in codenames as 3 clues are common to each player and each player has an assassin that is their teammates agent. Conveniently, there are many ways to tweak the difficulty, but you won't see me using the map. I really enjoy that I'm able to fit all of the necessary components for the base game, Pictures, and Duet all in the one box. This is a great entry into the series and I'm looking forward to what CGE (not USAopoly or other licensees) will do with the next.

RATING: 7
Codenames Duet is a great couples game. Where Codenames explored the broad and ambiguous nature of words, Duet drills into the shared lexicon of two people. Reducing the guessers to just a single person allows the clue giver to reference personal experiences in their clues, and adds an interesting new dynamic to the game. Additionally, the extra Assassins dramatically increases the game's drama. Since one of your Assassins is your partner's Codename, there is an added tension that was absent in its predecessor. Its also a much harder game, as transitioning between guessing, and cluing is a worthy challenge. Duet is a hallmark of iterative design, and a must play for any scholarly (or not) gamer.

RATING: 8.7
I waffled back and forth about whether I like Codenames or Codenames Duet better.  Duet turning the game purely cooperative gives a lot of opportunity for more robust deductive gameplay.  You can start figuring out the overlap between the two grids and using that to inform your decisions or to glean more information.  You can always be on the lookout for clues, so you have minimal downtime.  All in all, I think it might be the [i]better game[/i] than the original Codenames.

So why do I have Codenames ranked higher?

Simple - the laughter and trash talking is better.  There's no reveling in each others' failures, and even celebrating successes is much more muted, because everyone has too much information.  Codenames Duet might be the better game, but Codenames is the more fun one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 6
2 player version of a massively multiplayer co-op game? :what:  

Interesting concept and actually this is much harder than the standard codenames game due to the time pressure and also the fact that you are guessing on your own. 
in original codenames you can have a sort of group discussion and thus words you would not have thought about suddenly can seem to fit the clue. In this version you are on your own.

I like the idea of a campaign map whereby you vary the difficult of the games however after 4 abortive attempts at the first 'simplest' version I am certainly not ready to up the difficulty just yet.

The Game principle at its best. As both players take the role of the spymaster and both have to guess you are very involved the whole time.

I think this is a straight improvement on regular Codenames, which I already really like. The best part of Codenames is giving clues and this makes everyone be able to be the spymaster. It's also more satisfying to cooperate and win against the game rather than another team. The difficulty also forces taking risks, in the original you only had to keep ahead of the other team, sometimes rewarding careful, boring plays. To balance this, there are 3 assassins, which is another improvement since sometimes in the original, the assassin was really easy to play around, but in Duet there's always at least 1 assassin that's annoying. Finally, the fact that each codex card has specific colour matching rules on the other side just makes the game that much more strategic.

RATING: 9
Brilliantly fun. You and a partner take turns creating word puzzles which the other has to solve. Way more fun than it sounds. The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because the game completely lacks visual appeal. It is really the most boring looking game ever which makes it hard to convince people to play. Look at Lost Cities for inspiration on making a simple game look good. If the cards were themed using some cliche'd 60s cold-war stereotypes it could have been a ten. I'm thinking satellite images in the crosshairs, pasted newspaper headline messages, long distance surveillance photos, 60s computer blinkenlights, top secret or redacted files, self destruct messages, or anything along those lines. What a wasted opportunity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hoo boy is this one a brainburner.

The knack you need here is the ability to find connections between very different, essentially random "green" words, and then communicate them to your partner with a brief clue. The idea isn't to find the words you'd associate with the clue, but what your PARTNER would.

Sometimes finding the connections at all is tricky; sometimes the connection is obvious but you have to communicate it without accidentally clueing one of the "black" words that spell instant doom.

It's fun, but that couple of minutes of contemplative silence while both players desperately scan the board for something to tie together into a clue is exhausting for me.

Tip: when trying to indicate a single word by means of synonym ... don't use the words you remember from the SATs? (Even if they did actually get that one [i]right[/i] ...)

I find it ever so slightly sad that this isn't included with the base game; it's 'just right' for 2 players in the same way as the original is for larger groups, and the original has a printed 2p variant that's just not as good as this. But it's extra stuff some people would never use.

Still, this feels like it was discovered rather than invented. If you want to play Codenames with 2 this is the way to do it, and if you don't this won't change your mind.

Utterly genius!  When I saw that there was a codenames 2 player only(ish), I thought "this is just a cash grab.  This can't be any good.  It is just a cram-fit version to sell another codenames..."  Boy, was I wrong.  This game is fantastic.  I truly admire the designer for thinking up a truly ingenious fix to playing codenames with 2 players/teams.  When my friend bought it, we played like 10 times in a row, every game was fun.  10 stars!

I'm generally not that into word games but the 2p experience of Codenames Duet makes it a fun co-op puzzle you can work out with a friend. Both of you are giving clues and guessing so there's not that one-sided stress the original had. Also, Duet is fully compatible with all the other Codenames. This is a big bonus for me because I prefer Codenames Pictures far more than the plain word versions and Duet enables me to play Pictures with 2p aswell.

Co-operative codenames for 2 people or 2 teams and provides a whole new set of words to use and expand base codenames.

RATING: 7.75
Better than the original Codenames, Codenames Duet works well for 2 (or more) and retains all the flavor of Vlaada's popular gem.

Duet removes the competition between sides, adding in a timer to tighten the cooperative action. 

Players must now take turns identifying 15 agents from the field of 25, each player needing to identify as many as 9 agents.

When the timer expires, players must try to identify any remaining Cards by previously provided clues in a sudden-death round.

In addition, Duet provides some logic and some 'fog of war' in the dual-sided clue cards: each players sees only one side of the card, but what they know may or not match what the other player knows, as only some of the Agents appear similarly to both players.

This means that at least one of the Agents to be identified looks like an assassin, and some look like bystanders, which adds to the knowledge, but also the level of logic required.

Finally, Duet adds a challenge map which allows player spymasters to travel from City to City, with more difficult challenge levels.

The base game is terrific, but this version raises the game.

A great way to enjoy the word association of Codenames with two players.  I have yet to play it in teams so I cannot say whether I prefer it in general to Codenames, which is a claim I have heard a few others make.  The notable change (improvement?!) in this version is that there is effectively no downtime since each player/team is both guessing and clue-making.  All words are different to Codenames, so the words of each can be combined into a single pool, making this - at worst - a 400 word expansion to whichever of the two you prefer!

I actually like this better than the original -- it's very interesting to try to figure out which are your shared cards, and kind of mind-bending to move between clue-giver and clue-guesser.

In any case, I'm thinking of getting a copy; this is something I could imagine casually breaking out and playing in an evening, and there aren't many games of that sort that I actually like. (1 play)

While I enjoy Codenames, I personally find it best with at least 6 players... Codename Duet on the other hand fits nicely with a smaller crowd (2-4).  I also like that both sides are having to work at being the spymaster and so it feels like less wasted time as each spymaster is working out the perfect clue.  I also like that it has additional challenges to make the game harder as you learn how the person you are playing with thinks.

We will also try it with other codename cards. This possibilit is a huge plus for the franchise.

This is a really good two-player implementation of Codenames.  My wife and I will sometimes just take it to a (non-fancy, non-busy) restaurant and just set it up and play.    The game offers a challenge system based on a world map (to tick off such-and-such, you need to get all 15 words in X rounds with no more than Y mistakes) that helps with replayability.  The words are fully interchangeable with the original version of Codenames so if you own both you have twice as much stock for playing either game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2017)

I, absolutely, love Codenames. I have purchased every version of the game and I like them all. Codenames was my favorite game on 2015 so I was very keen to play Codenames Duet. The game continues to be very engaging and I had lots of fun playing it.

This new version of the game, uses the same core of old Codenames, but now the game is fully cooperative. The new rules are easy to teach. If you are familiar with the game you can do it under 2 minutes, if you are not familiar with the game, the game explanations takes under 5 minutes. Codenames is a very simple game. Playtime is around 15 minutes.

Among the changes are: 1. Players are now playing a cooperative game and both players will give a clue and have to guess in each of their turns. 2. Now you can try to guess as many clues as you want. The number in the clue doesn’t limit you any longer. 3. There is a “campaign” mode that considerably adds to the difficulty of the game. 4. Now, there are 3 assassins per side and 3 common green spots per side, it introduces a small, but significant, deduction element into the game. 5. The words now include a wider range of topics and names. 6. The downtime is greatly reduced in this version of the game.

This edition of Codenames can be combined with any other edition of the game (a huge plus for me). It also has a distinctive mark to tell the cards apart, I really appreciate this.

Best with 2 players. You can still play in teams, but I prefer 2 players only.

Bottom line, Codenames Duet is a good game that feels very different from its parent game. I’m not sure how often I will play it as a two player game as I generally prefer heavier games in this slot, but I will definitely keep it among my game collection. I want to play it again and I want to play the campaign. I still like more the original Codenames, but this is a very solid game, Vlaada Chvátil does it again (he is my favorite game designer).

Attention! This game is not as good as the normal one. Why? It is cooperative and both players have some same words they need to guess. That's why the players can not talk to each other.

One of the very few cooperative games I really enjoy.
I like the interactive, creative and puzzly aspects in this one. A few lucky and strategic elements mixed in.
Sometimes risky/conservative clues are more rewarded in specific "scenarios" (which are as non-thematic as can be). You may sometimes deduct a word by the position of the card in the grid, which is a nice addition.
I love the fact that the downtime is reduced by the rule that the first player who finds a good clue automatically becomes the starting player.

The 2p coop system works like a charm. That being said, I'm not a huge fan of the Word version of Codenames, so my criticisms here are the same as for the other one, but I might buy it only to play Duet CN Pictures.

A co-operative version of Codenames that I actually prefer to the base game, meant as a two player game but it works well even at 4 or 6 players because teams can discuss the best clues to give the other team to try and win.

Codenames Duet doesn’t replace Codenames for parties. It does provide that same wonderful Codenames experience at a much smaller player count.

+ I like how Codenames Duet is nothing like the 2 player variant for Codenames, which I dislike. 
+ The game has higher player involvement than Codenames as both players can think about their clues simultaneously.
+ I like playing with less players so the two player only nature of the game works well for me.

Captures the magic of Codenames for only two players. Very good game for couples on date nights. The ability adjust the difficulty up or down is also an added benefit.

I had high hopes for it since I adore the original Codenames. It really does work well with only two. All the angst of struggling to link words in meaningful ways for others to comprehend is still there, but now it's just you and one other working together to solve the puzzle/challenge. I'm happy to see this evolution of the Codenames series into a great two player experience. I thought the calming green color scheme was a nice, subtle touch to emphasize and distinguish the totally cooperative nature of this iteration from it's older cousin.

RATING: 7.9
A two-person variant of the hugely successful Codenames franchise, Duet is a cooperative game that really delivers.  The mechanic is very similar to the original, and it's quite easy to learn; the 'judging' component isn't nearly as random as it is in a lot of games, but that doesn't reduce the difficulty one bit.  Maybe the most surprising thing about this excellent game is how fiendishly hard it is!

The design is basically the same as the original, with its simple party-game vibe.  It's lots of fun and has a bunch of competitive variants built right in, but what's really shocking is that this is a damn difficult game -- albeit one you'll want to play again and again.

Codenames Duet is a very nice sequel to the original game. This game is a great couple activity, as it sometimes makes you discover how your love one thinks differently than you first have thought. The mini-campaign in the game is a neat addition to the game as it changes the challenges of the game and brings a feeling of accomplishment as you progress. The fact you can mix the words with the original game makes it a ''must-buy'' for me.

While it is cool that yuo can have some phrases overlap and so can strategically save harder ones for later hoping your partner gives you a clue that kills 2 birds with one stone, there is just some tension lacking when you are just racing against a timer rather than an opposing team.

If you had told me that there was a two-player Codenames, I would have scoffed, then told me that it was coöp, I would have been intrigued but still scoffed.  Remarkably, it plays pretty well.  Annoyingly, there can be no-win scenarios well before the game ends, but I have to applaud the out-of-the-box execution of the brief.

LOVE this game, and this coming from someone who was never that into the original. Having everyone get in on the cluegiving changes everything, and coming up with a fantastic clue gives the group a satisfying feeling that didn't happen quite the same way in the original. You can play this game like eating popcorn. I've also tried it with up to six people and it both retains its fun and evolves in interesting ways--one teammate wants to consult on every clue, while the other will decide to just blurt one out, which angers the first until the clue works fantastically well.

Rating based on 2 players.

This game solves all the problems I had with Codenames, which I liked the gameplay of but found too slow with too much downtime. In Duets you're always engaged, as even when you're waiting for clues you're also using that time to formulate ones of your own--and being Codemaster is the most interesting part of the game for me. The added time pressure also strongly rewards multiple word clues, virtually eliminating boring "_____ 1" hints.

This was a very good entry game for my girlfriend to get into board games ... since then we've made several other board game purchases (largely based on the reviews here at BGG) - and we look forward to playing those games soon!  Worth the money - worth the laughter that comes with it :)

Fantastic co-op game with a simple idea and great execution. Deduction skills can be used to a huge advantage for harder challenges.

The cards are interchangable with the other Codenames games, which is great!

In my experience, one playing round is usually far more than 15 min though, closer to 45 min.

I think the original Codenames are slightly better, but this 2 player version works really well, but in the long run, I think the joy from the original game is better, though this game contains a campaign to challenge yourself even more.

Like the original game, this one misses an inlay which would have been very benefitial.

Very good two player implementation of the Codenames system.  Fixes some of the clunkier elements from the original game's variant.

Wish they had brought out a smaller upgrade pack for those of us with the base game.

With this version being co-op and suiting a lower player count, I think I enjoy this a little more then the original Codenames.

Great co-op version of Codenames (works best with two, but I could see it working okay with more). Still has the same problem that the game can stall out while one person is trying to figure out how to clue the other, but that doesn't bother us much when we're playing as a couple. You can also use cards from Codenames: Pictures with it, which is cool.

I already love Codenames and we actually already played the basic one with 2 sometimes, but I like that this now gives you an actual goal. 
My personal feeling is though that the (german) words of this set are slightly harder, at least for us it often felt a lot more difficult to connect bigger groups, maybe they used the "best" words already in the first one? :D (or we just declined in our codenames skill :D )

Codenames Duet is a two-player cooperative version of the word game Codenames. Word cards are laid out in a grid just like in Codenames. However, the key card is double-sided, and each player has a number of cards they need their partner to guess as well as three assassin cards that end the game. These may or may not be different for each player, so I may be trying to guess a card marked as an assassin on my side for my partner's clue. The goal is to guess the combined 11 clue cards before a set number of turns and without hitting an assassin. I didn't know how they'd manage to make Codenames work with two, but I think they really succeeded. Additionally, the boredom I felt with being exclusively a guesser was eliminated, as both players are clue-givers.

If you like regular Codenames and you like being the clue-giver, this is perfect for you. It's a very good light two player cooperative game, where you try to guess what the other player is thinking.

You can play the game with four players, but that makes it less strong of a game. I would prefer regular Codenames with four players.

One thing I didn't like is the mission pad. It "dictates" how you should play, but it's totally superfluous. I DO like the option to set your own difficulty and type of "mission", but you don't need the mission pad for that.

two player version that can be played with more people cooperatively if you wish. Some what improved version of original game. 

This version makes it so everyone is involved in both clue giving and clue guessing. This helps keep things more interesting for everyone and from getting bored as they will be more actively engaged in the game play.

It's a good game. It might go up to an 8 with time. But I think I actually enjoy this game more as a party game rather than just two. For a two player a game I think there has to be more to it.

Brings a legitimate Codenames experience for the 2-3 player game.  With 4+ I would almost always rather play regular Codenames (the exception being when there is no way to balance teams, like 3 friends and a stranger).  Fortunately the word list should mix well and it can all fit in one box (skip the Duet agent cards if you must)!  I am a little concerned about possible pattern memorization but have no way to investigate without causing a problem for myself...

Wife bought this one.

The changes to make it 2-player are interesting. I look forward to trying the campaign style map. Since most of my gaming is done at a 2 player count I see this getting played more than Codenames.  The original still has a place, but it does seem they know overlap greatly in terms of usefulness in a collection.

A 2 player version of this game was just what it needed. They did a fantastic job of adapting it to the new player count. A great game to play for couples. The campaign is silly, but the thought behind changing the difficulty by reducing rounds or reducing how many you can get wrong is fantastic. You can really ramp up the difficulty to the impossible.

RATING: 8.3
Clever implementation of great party game.

Same game "engine", same thinky fun, although this is not a party game. This is the only reason for lowering a rating a bit, but the game itself is perfect. And there is even some advantage over it's party counterparts (vanilla/pictures) that for you are still IN (you give hints and guess all the time)

RATING: 7.1
like a really clever version of codenames, except that you're trapped with only one other person on your team and if that person's thoughts don't parallel your own, then you're going to have a bad time. my wife and i finish each other's sentences and still have yet to beat the 9-9 game. luckily it can be played as teams which leads me to think that this version will fully replace our old base set game. it's definitely fun and can easily be played twice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The best version of Codenames so far.  Eliminates the downtime of the other larger player-count versions, and lets you play both roles and full time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In the original Codenames, the spy master could be thinking of a clue the entire time the other team was taking their turn, but in this game, you have to think of a clue and guess at the same time (pretty much), and it's a lot more difficult to juggle those roles without dragging the game out. There's more assassin spaces so more opportunities for the game to end suddenly as well, which I'm not sure I like. 

This game also seems to disincentivize talking out your reasoning behind guessing, as you could very easily give away what spots are good or assassins tiles on your side if you're not careful. For example, I tend to sound out the clue with each card on the table, but I found myself skipping over my assassin spots.

Additionally, except for a deck of double-sided key cards, I don't really see what this adds that's not in the base game. I understand why they made this a separate product, and I certainly don't fault them for trying to make as much money from this smash hit as they can, but it feels like they could have offered a pack of just the new key cards for owners of the original game, and I would have much preferred that. As is, you can probably just wait for the inevitable companion app and use just that.

Finally, I thought the original was perfectly playable with the 2 player variant, and didn't have the drawbacks in this game.

All in all, a good enough game, but I already own and prefer the original.

Another fun twist on the Codenames franchise. Time time they figured out how to do a two-player version. I really like that it's cooperative and that there's overlap on the card. It doesn't feel like a tacked on game just to squeeze more money out of the brand, nor does it jam two-player rules into a system that can't handle it. I really enjoyed it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this new coop variant. You play face-to-face racing to identify all the agents in a limited number of rounds, with a two-sided key card that gives each side an asymmetric view of the board with some overlap to keep you from deducing too much, and your guesses are scored by the other side's key.  I think it works even better as a coop game than as a competitive game, as the fun comes from coming up with clever clues with just the right amount of stretch and the accomplishment of deciphering them correctly, and coop removes the disconnect between being impressed by great plays and feeling bad over losing to them.  Now, you're working together to be as awesome as possible, and, best of all, you get to do more of the clueing and guessing since there's no other team taking time while you wait.  I highly recommend it. The words are interchangeable and unique between this and the original, so get both and combine them to play whichever way you feel like at the moment.

We mostly purchased this game as a way to double our word count for Codenames, but the two player variant is super fun as well. A lot of folks online claim it's the best version, and we tend to disagree. It is a lot more difficult since there are five potential assassins on the board, which is nice. But a large amount of the enjoyment from Codenames is the banter back and forth between teammates and opponents. So while Duet is very good, I think Codenames shines brightest as a party game.

Excellent follow-up to the Codenames system. Makes my favorite game even better. I used to play the vanilla co-op game with non-confrontational people but it was definitely missing something and this fixes that. Also somewhat fixes the (minor) issue where essentially nothing happens for the first minute of the game while the starting codemaster is looking for their first clue. Since every player is a codemaster, everyone can be actively engaged at all times.

Fantastic iteration of Codenames that, to make it function with two players, turns it into a co-op with a limited number of attempts allowed. Each player sees a slightly different grid and alternates between giving and receiving clues.

The biggest problem with the original game was the potential for downtime, which is gone here; everyone is engaged. It scales to any number of players by just putting them in teams. For me it completely kills the original game.

[CEG 2017 Edition] {Deduction, co-op, word; 2p} I do admire the design from Vlaada Chvátil.  He is prolific and innovative.  His games is fun and refreshing, and usually interactive.

Codenames duet is an awesome 2p co-op variant of Codenames.  The game play is essentially the same.  Players give out a clue with word and number and let his fellow to guess which words on the grid are agents.  It’s challenging due to the time pressure.  In a standard game, players have only 9 turns to complete the guesses.  It is very fun and challenging.  Players have to understand how his fellow think and interpret the clue and must try to maximum the number of guesses each turn in order to win.

The choice of words are nice.  It mixes with different difficulties and categories.  So it would be suitable for players with different English levels.

The illustration of agents is dumb, though.

The Mission Map is fun and is even more challenging.  It serves to be a good record track of achievement!  Some cities are particularly difficult.  It is very good to play with the map.

Played at the UKGE: pretty much fixes the only issue I ever had with Codenames, since you don't need to decide who is the spymaster anyone, since everyone plays both roles now. No competitive aspect but I think the puzzle element present in the game is deeper than for regular Codenames. A high point of my play of the game was managing to correctly guess the last agent on the very last turn.

:thumbsup: The amazing experience of Codenames, which now scales perfectly to 2P. And in fact, Duet is even MORE fun with 4P+! At higher player counts you get more strategy talk at the table, which is great for a co-op.
:thumbsup: Other improvements over the original Codenames include: no downtime (you're constantly either guessing clues or thinking about your next clue), everyone is a clue-giver (which is the best part of the game), and co-op Codenmaes is a shared fun where nobody ever has hard feelings (not that it was an issue for me in the original).
:thumbsup: Codenames is both a deep gamers' game AND an accessible gateway / party game at the same time! You might ask, how can this be? This is possible because Codenames uses your language skill, which is the most advanced skill every adult human has pretty much mastered. Humans excel at language by nature, and Codenames taps into this potential, allowing every single player to make expert-level decisions with no learning curve. It's amazing how much you can enjoy the decision-making process in Codenames already in your first game!
:thumbsup: The game is HARD! Like any good co-op should be. There seems to be an almost infinite potential to improve in this game even further. You can't ever "solve" it.
:thumbsup: Codenames is educational! You will learn a lot from other players, and not just words, but actual facts about the world. E.g., some one gives a clue WIND 2 for SUN and PRESSURE, and after the game has to explain how wind is actually created, because nobody guessed it correctly. How cool is that!
:thumbsup: It's also double the amount of words for the original Codenames, and the other way round.
[b][color=green]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:?block: When playing with 3P+, we find it best to use pen and paper to discuss what clues to give privately. It's just as fun, or even more fun, than giving clues alone. 
:!block: Codenames might not be exactly what you expect from a party game. While it's fun, somewhat socially engaging, and accessible, it's also really thinky (if you want to win).
:!block: We never had this problem in our games, but "anyone can give a clue anytime" rule may potentially invite alpha gamers to do more than their fair share. To counter that, the rulebook has a variant for taking turns giving clues.

This feels exactly like Codenames. However, since Codenames doesn't work with two players this game just isn't very good.

Some reviewers have said that this feels totally different from regular Codenames and I completely disagree. You still just want to give the best clues possible while avoiding the assassins. It feels exactly the same. But instead of the great group dynamic that Codenames has, here you're just giving clues to one person. Sure there are multiple assassins and some overlapping words, but that doesn't change the thought process from round to round.

This may be as good as it gets when it comes to a two player version of Codenames, but for me it just proves that Codenames isn't meant as a two player game.

coop codenames for two? yay! Damn hard, though - be prepared to lose a lot. But then, we banged out four games on our first run, since they go quickly. Words feel much harder for us than pictures (which is the version we played before), so after a few plays we switched to the pictures and the rating is for that combination - words felt far too stressing and annoying to us.

Codenames Duet is a variation off the popular Codenames. It allows players to play cooperatively against the game instead of against each other. Each side has a different set of words they're trying to clue their partners into (some of which overlap). Each side has three assassin words (which are different from side to side). There's a limited number of turns to get all the clues. If you get all the clue words before time runs out, you win.

Overall the feel of the game was very much the same.

Takes the Codenames formula and makes it 2 players which is amazing. Our biggest issue was Codenames was it was no fun to play with under 6 people meaning it never saw much table time. Now we can play it whenever we want!

Only 2p so far, but this co-op version will stick. We have yet to win (0-3), but that only makes me want to try again with players of all types and skill levels.  Especially those with reflective glasses.

Better than Pictures and Deep Undercover, to be sure, and the cards can be used with the base set (and vice versa).  Unlike the other sequels, I'll definitely seek out my own copy.

I like that it forces you to come up with good clues, both through the timer mechanic and the necessity of convincing the guesser that something is different from what they see.

Not entirely sure it's necessary since we have both the words and pictures versions

Best co-op game I've ever played, and I detest co-op games. All players are engaged during the game. Limited turns and pressure not to let down the team keeps game tension high. Combines with original Codenames so worth owning both.

My wife and I have enjoyed Duet as much as regular Codenames, and maybe even more. The cooperative element is much stronger since both sides have to give clues.

I hope for a danish version of this.

Given the choice I would play the original over this but it's a twist on the rules. Perfect for when you have fewer than 4 players.

Torturous, cruel, evil, and so fun. It took a duo that is unstoppable at Codenames Pictures ten tries to win Duet the first time.

Harder than Codenames which is good. But for some reason very rarely played.

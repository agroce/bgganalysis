I mostly enjoyed this thematic game, though I've removed it from my wish list because I didn't really like the parasitic nature of building things.  Maybe I just played poorly, but it seemed like every time I built a mine or a sawmill, someone else got more use out of it than I did.  Even so, I came in second, but it seems like that kind of system would promote a really mean style of play where you do nothing that could potentially help any other player.  I'd probably play it again, since I enjoyed the thematic nature of it, but it annoyed me a lot to have built a mine and then have another player zoom over, use dynamite, and take 2/3rds of the lode before I could even mine once.  Definitely unique, though--it felt like you could do a ton of different things in a fun world of possibilities, and it actually played in a reasonable amount of time.

I've only played this once so my comments may change.  First off, the rules are not well written so it takes an age to work out what's going on.  Having said that, when you get going it's a pretty simple game.  I think it will be a lot of fun and may be a good family game as well as being suitable for gamers.  Lots of really nice pieces.

Gave it as a present to my niece who wanted a "grown-up game" (she turned 10 this year). Nice concept. Good gameplay. Needs a few games to grasp the concept, the strategy and the rules. Even the rules seems simple there is a good chance to play it wrong the first few games. Glad I gave it as a present so it will be played often.

Two games played with incorrect rules, so I won't rate the game yet. There seems to be some potential but some problems too.

Fun game, but leeching other players is annoyingly easy.

it's been a while since i've played this one, so i'm rating pretty retroactively.  we played 2 3-player games on the first night, and i think i might have later tried it with 4.  a lot of rules clarifications were necessary, and although bgg helped out with files and faqs and whatnot i was a bit disappointed.  i love the bits and the theme, but the game seemed to be all about getting there second and taking advantage of a mine someone else opened or managing to be left alone while others quarrel.  clearly the latter effect is more exaggerated in 3p games and i'm willing to give it more of a shot, but i don't see how this could ever reach the rating heights that so many have given it.

Using the correct rules, this game is quite good.  It is possible to spend time racing out to explore, but it appears that it may be more beneficial to attempt to get as much goods as possible, even if means slower exploration.  Claim jumping will make the game more competitive.  Highly enjoyable game and a touch better than Goldland.  [GTI: TPSL]

RATING: 3
The production quality is great. The art on the tiles is excellent and the mid game map example in the rules suggested that the terrain would develop. The freedom to explore and locate your own way, along with a wide array of mining parafanalia and transport for sale seemed to offer a game with great depth and re-playability. We read the rules and worked out the need to build up equipment by shuttling back and forth to the Trading Post in order to obtain those elusive 10 gold nuggets. 

So off we went and 4 turns later one player has piggy-backed a mine, built a saw mill, emptied the mine and strolled back to the start with 11 nuggets ably assisted by whisky. Including 25 minutes to absorb the rules the game was all over in 40 minutes. The random nuggets on the counters mean that you can get lucky in a few turns and the game is over regardless of what the other players do. Mountains are the place to go, mine and win. Whilst thats the case, other efforts to pan for river gold are fultile.

It really seems like this wasn't play tested properly and with substantially rewritten rules to adjust the randomness of the nugget distribution there may be a decent game in there struggling to get out. But for now, what a stinker.

I was really looking forward to this game.  My wife and I like exploration games like Goldland.  We didn't finish our first game of this-- we didn't even make it past about a dozen turns.  The game seemed like a chore.  Multiple turns were spent just moving to a place to get some resource that would then take multiple turns to get to where you wanted to use them.  All to get money that you would then have to trek back to the beginning to cash in for better equipment.  We've played many games where you have to build up money and then supplies, but this game just felt like wading through drying concrete.  My only thought is that maybe more actions per turn should be allowed.  It shouldn't take multiple turns to achieve the most basic game goals.

Theme and mechanics are extremely well integrated.  Reasonably fun, but it's the play is quite incremental.  There are a few minor ambiguities in the rules, but I think we resolved them all with common sense.

First Play: We had terrible draws of the tiles and it made it impossible to irrigate the river gold behind a mountain range.  Something needs to be done with the randomness of the tile draw.  A player said that they played the game before but it was much better as they didn't have the tile drawing problems.  I will give this game another try as I love the theme and exploration.

Second Play:  I just purchased.  I will say I was going to try again and I really like it.  Very fun game that I will try to get into the rotation on a regular basis.  Increase rating.

Feels fun.  Somewhat imbalanced with regards to the limited availability of carts, dynamite & other items.  Seems like it would be near-impossible to win if you solely collect River gold.  Feels like the miners cannot carry enough items... maybe because we were all stingy about building sawmills.

4/24/06 - need to get this game played soon.

Update: have played this a few times now and enjoyed every game. In one game I employed a strategy of loading up on items which would help me mine gold but fell behind quite badly since the others playing simply loaded up on river gold and ended the game - leaving me last. So, while you can enter the game with a strategy in mind, you need to pay attention to the other explorers to make sure you don't fall victim to a quick end to the game.

My rating could go up or down with repeated play as it is based on one playing.  I was taught the mechanics but not any of the strategy for optimizing my gold collection and was therefore left in the dust by the people who taught me the game (two of whom got carts and dynamite and cleaned out the mines).  I want to play again now that I understand more of how everything works and how some combinations of items will help me out better than others.  The game seems light at first but actually has some depth to it that deserves exploring.  However, I'm uncertain if the strategy of cart + dynamite is the only viable strategy or not.  If it is then the replayability of this game will drop quite a bit.  Only a further playing will determine if that is the case and whether or not I will want to get this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A bit boring and really long.  I think further plays will reduce playing time (as long as you play with people who've played before), a lot of options available, and some are obviously better than others.  I'd play again, but I won't be asking for this one.

I haven't played it yet, but it got good reviews from friends who played it at my game night recently.

Finally played this one.  My wife and I took 2 prospectors each.  The game ended after about 2 hours when one of my prospectors with 10 mountain gold pieces headed back to the trading post to end the game.

It was a blast, and my wife said she wanted to play again.  The game seems a bit "fiddly" in the early going, but once you get the rules down it develops a really nice flow.  Wargamers would like this one as you have many choices to achieve victory.  You can go for the river gold, which is easier to obtain but less valuable, or you can go for the mountaingold, which is harder to get but more valuable.  

You can purchase lots of stuff to help you get gold, including fishing rods, hunting rifles, dynamite, horses, boats, and carts.  You can even build fish traps and sawmills which help you take more food and lumber.  

My only criticisms:

1.  The rules aren't entirely clear in all places. This did not hamper our enjoyment of the game but it did slow things down.

2.  I'm not sure that dynamite is a cost effective way to mine mountaingold.

Other than those minor criticisms, I highly recommend this game!

Some fun stuff in here, and almost a rather good game. But the cart is a big problem, there is a huge first-mover advantage to getting lucky and finding the first gold nugget and coming back to turn it into a cart - this is a game of efficiency and the cart is the biggest efficiency boost available, and there are only two of them for no apparent reason.

Also the "cooperative/competitive" balance doesn't work very well - you need someone to bite the bullet and build some infrastructure for you to leech off of. The person who builds first is not going to win. So a bad dynamic there.

Also, it's too fiddly. You spend a few moments making a decision then a few minutes pushing things around to actually do it. Getting things done requires too many steps, and each turn gets too little done.

Lastly, the game too frequently puts you in a position in which you can make no forward progress and have nothing productive to do. You just want to wait until some else cracks first so you can jump on their investment.

Anyway, clever stuff, nice art, but for me no dice. I really wish it were better, but I just don't think it is.

Ok exploration/resource management game.  It just seemed as if something was missing, and that each turn was kind of tedious and boring.  Spend a turn sitting in one spot and fishing; spend a turn cutting down some wood; use the meat and wood to mine a gold; repeat a bunch of times.  It was still kind of fun, but I thought it left something to be desired.

Tremendously fun game.  What this game lacks in tension, it makes up for in it's puzzle nature and tight gameplay with respect to your options on your turn, and availability of items, etc.  Much better than Goldland, which is pretty much totally different, but same thematically. It scales well, looks great and inspires onlookers.  The rules are very vague....check the FAQ before playing.

I traded for this game without ever having played it (a rarity for me, as I like to try things before I buy).  But the concept and theme are what sold me on it, so I am looking forward to playing.  Seems to be a well-liked game here on the Geek, so really, how can I go wrong.

EDIT after playing:  This was definitely worthy of the trade that I made to acquire this game.  This combines both elements of archealogical exploration (ala Thebes) as well as an engrossing tile-placement strategy (ala Alhambra).  It really is a disappointment that the guys at Kronberget Speile couldn't find a way to get this into the American market for distribution - I think it could be a well-liked game on this side of the pond.

This is a fun game that for some reason reminds me of Roads & Boats light.  You build out a network that generates resources - and these resources can be used by anyone.  Even though it's lighter than Roads & Boats, there is a lot going on here, and it's not as light as it looks at first appearance.  I'm not sure if it gets a little scripted after a while, but it's a fun game that I would play again.

I'm excited to play this game again. The theme is great and I really enjoy the exploration aspect. Movement feels a bit limited though. I felt like there were always a bunch of things I wanted to do, but was not able to. I think that is a good thing unless it becomes clear that there are sure fire ways to win. Right now it seems any strategy could win it.

Updated from an 8 to a 9 after five plays. Only having one action and a limited carrying capacity is what makes this game really great. Preparation and adaptation are really important. The game has played out so differently in every session. It is fun watching everyone develop their strategies and try to set up big mining scores that no one can mooch off of.

Unfortunately, my fiance thinks the game is boring. She thinks that there isn't enough to do in the game. I think the real problem is that there is too much to do. If you don't have a plan things can get rough and lots of turns end up feeling wasted.

A good Euro that features most of the good elements of the style but few of the bad- there's plenty of optimization and efficiency planning but there's also a healthy dose of a goldrush theme that makes it work with the mechanics very well.  Similarities to GOLDLAND are actually pretty superficial and both games have pretty different outcomes, but in the end I have to give the nod to LOST VALLEY if only because it's more specifically themed.  The rhombs make for some interesting placement options, the equipment system works very well, and the game is, in the end, just fun to play.  It does seem that with 2 or 3 players the competition isn't really there so it seems to really need 4 players to work properly.  A good production is marred only by the crude, washed out art on the player cards.  Overall, a winner and a great choice in term s of the simpler exploration/adventure games.

One play.  Interesting.  One of my first reactions was that the game reminded me of Roads & Boats (must be the gold mines), and the more we played the more I felt my comparison was valid.  I don't think it's as deep or strategic as R&B, but it's a lot shorter.  That's the trade-off.

The first play of this game was rather disastrous as me and my fellow players expected it to be something it wasn't. Will replay once I have read the extensive FAQ and studied some basic strategy guides.

Fun exploration game, though I find myself slightly disappointed at how the river tends to segregate prospectors from each other. (Not everyone can have a canoe.) That, long setup time, long-ish play time, only takes 2-4, limitations on equipment inventory feel slightly too restrictive...all minor dings, but they add up.

Nice game, but I thought the movement was a little too limited. I was able to completely block an opponent a little too easily. The limit on items is also a little frustrating. (Only 2 players can get fishing poles, etc.)

A pretty solid game experience, but doesn't quite reach the next level.  I enjoyed buying goods, hunting, fishing, and mining, and 'leveling up' my prospector with more equipment.  If you go into it thinking that you just want to 'be a prospector', and aren't necessarily looking for a heavy euro experience, it will fill that void.

RATING: 7
Every Lost Valley game session is a little different because of the way tiles are drawn at random and placed on the board (table). It seems to have a balance between luck and strategy, but leans more towards strategy then luck. Sometimes I will change the rules a little and set up all tiles and place all the gold before starting the game. The saw mill and fishing net are not set out before the start of the game and require building. I also will trade with another player if they are on the next corner, or there can be a co-op sharing of resources to build a mine. It took me a few games before I could remeber the original rules.

I only played this once, and we had a horrible time.  The game seemed very fiddly and half baked.  I learned a week later that we may have been playing by the wrong rules, but I'm still not sure.

So take this rating with a grain of salt.  The components are beautiful.  I was so taken with the entire theme that I couldn't wait to play...  So perhaps I also had my expectations set a bit high...

Not really much in the way of player interaction.  But who cares?  I'm a reclusive prospector when I play this - rather like Daniel Plainview in 'There Will Be Blood'.  I shun interaction.  I'm quite happy panning for gold, dragging my mule and cart up the mountain. 
It's all rather processional I suppose, but it has a randomly produced map, excellent bits, fishin, huntin, and dynamite. I love it.

Explore the regions gathering wood and food.  Seek out the rivergold and mountaingold tiles to exchange the wood/food for gold nuggets. There are a variety of wares that you can purchase to assist in this process.  But you can only hold so much!  Long-term strategies are tough to come by.  This is more a tactical game of read-and-react based on what tiles come out and what other players do.  Enjoyed my first game.  We immediately played it again...which is a rarity in my group.  Starting at 7, could go up.

RATING: 6
Fun exploration game.  Players represent prospectors setting out from a Trading Post at a waterfall into the great unknown.  On a turn, you can move/explore, and take one action.  Movement is conducted along the tile dividing lines, revealing new terrain when you hit unexplored territory. Actions are mining gold, trading gold for new stuff at the trading post, fishing, hunting, building, draw a special tile, or chop down a tree.  In performing an action, you will either gain stuff or lose stuff so in effect you have a logistical puzzle akin to Roads and Boats.  You can only carry so much stuff, so economical use of movement/actions is where the game pays off.  The game ends when the river freezes over, or when a prospector has drawn ten gold counters and declares the end of the game at the Trading Post.  Excellent exploration game, initially bewildering in terms of your movement/action options (not at all difficult to play), but plays extremely quickly once you're familiar with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Probably the best exploration game out there... tile-placement and lots of smooth supply-chain systems. Far superior to the similar Goldland. The drawback here is the open-info tactical nature of the game coupled with low interaction. Even if you're averse to "wait for your turn, find the best move" games this is the best of the bunch, so try it out!

This game has grown on me as I've played it.  As an exploration game I don't find it as clever as Mesopotamia.  It still provides some clever moments and the art reminds me of camping as a boy scout, and the boy scout survival journals which is a warming memory.

The title and box art are a little misleading.   The game is essentially a gold-rush exploration type of game, with a notable influence from Settlers and Carcassonne.   Once you learn what's going on, turns are very, very fast.  Move and take an action, in either order.   Actions usually involve gathering resources or spending resources for VPs (gold nuggets).   Nothing new there.  There is a slight problem where a player can follow behind another player and reap the benefits of their work since building things costs you resources, but once built they can be used by anybody.    Mountain gold strategies seem to be better than river gold strategies as well, so I'm not sure how many viable paths to victory there are.   We under-utilized the triangle tiles in our games, those appear to be significant and should be aimed for.   Fast and fun enough that I'd be willing to play it again even though it's not perfect.

More of a theme-first, simulation game than an euro. You are playing a gold digger, and to support that quest you need food and timber. There are a plethora of items and tools that can be helpful or even necessary to dig gold, hunt food, or cut timber.

Only one play so far and I am really drawn into the exploration theme. It seems there are multiple strategies one can pursue which would seem to lend to high replayability. Really looking forward to playing again.

Great theme, nice components. Once you know the actions it plays quite fast. Our first game with 3 players (all new) took about 90 minutes. The game ended because of one player returning to the base camp with 10 gold pieces (but losing with 17 nuggest to 19 nuggets). But the ice (alternative ending condition) was only 5 tiles away from the waterfall...

Why this goes to a nine?  I like that I've found a euro game that has mechanics that are deeply wedded to a theme.

Best exploration game I've found so far.  Just because you stumble upon the motherload of gold doesn't mean that you can exploit it.  Instead you need the gear ready to start extracting gold and that means carefully organizing your choice of equipment to carry and where you want to move on any given turn.  Thus it doesn't all come down to who happens to move to a sweet spot first.

The game looks good, the artwork and little details adds additional flavor to a system that already stresses a theme.

I look forward to an expansion!

This is a unique game that delivers thematically but always left a little to be desired in terms of game play. We attributed this disappointment to the fact that the game is about not being poached or taken advantage of so that you frequently would not do things in hopes that people would move away from you. The experience of not doing stuff or doing stuff that benefits someone else as much as you (though you had to pay the resources!) is not particularly inspiring.

Fortunately, we stumbled onto the idea of playing this 2 vs 2 instead of individually and this game is suddenly a LOT more fun and interesting. The team aspect opens the game up such that players do more instead of waiting to see what other players do and infused our play with a lot more energy than is usually there. People were excitedly planning on what they were going to do in concert. Later on, my teammate and I got horses and then invaded the mountain range the other two players had discovered and stole most of the gold. It was great fun, and the game finally reach the level I had hoped it would. 

UPDATE: I was very disappointed in the new Kickstarter version. For all the delays, the game was released with mistaken components (which they did correct) and rules that weren’t much better than the original. It seemed like every time we tried to play there was some rules confusion. I finally tired of trying to make this game work (first as a team game and then with the new rules) and sold it off.

After waiting a few years to finally print off the English rules, I open the game to find it contains English rules.

A nice exploration game, the rhomboids work well, but the rules are just a bit too basic. Some more idea of what to do would help. How do you spread out from the river and so on? A bit more of a sim than a game, it's too hard to cross the river, and the players coming later get to exploit your work building saw-mills and fish traps and mines.

If you find it cheap, snap it up, but give it plenty of leeway when playing. The gaps in the rules will need your imagination.

Hmm, hmm. Nem lenne ez rossz, de:

- kicsit szenvedős a játék, főleg az elején, gyakran a a saját farkába harap a kigyó: a bányásznék, de ahhoz kaja kell, de ahhoz meg, de ahhoz meg arany, akkor bányásznom kéne...
- már három játékosnál is előjön, hogy nem éri meg semmit építeni, mert gyakorlatilag a többieknek építed. Mire újra sorra kerülsz már el is vitték a bányádból az aranyakat.

Node azért vannak pozitívumok is:
- gyors, pörgős játékmenet, ha már valaki megértette egyszer a szabályokat.
- hangulat, tematika
- Nagyon szép, épülő pálya.

Első hiányosságai ellenére mindenképp megér még egy próbát.

RATING: 6
At first glance, Lost Valley looks like an adventure game: exploring the Wild West in search for fame and (most importantly) gold. When you actually play the game it becomes clear pretty quickly that it's really an optimisation game, though. You try to collect the most gold nuggets as quickly as possible. That means you'll spend some of your hard-earned wealth on tools just so that you can improve your success ratio later on.

The game nevertheless captures the feeling of exploration quite well. Once the first claims have been set up it also becomes a sometimes fierce competition about who gets how much. It's not easy to defend a gold mine from those human vultures!

Luck does play a role mainly with the tile draws and when hunting. The former seems pretty much negligible while the latter can lead to huge swings since you either lose one turn or can end up with loads of valuable food. Since you can buy a rifle to improve the hunter's chances or go fishing instead (which has deterministic results) that's not too much of a problem.

Excellent theme that fits very well with the game mechanics. This game really gives the feel of an explorers adventures through the wilderness mining for gold. There are many different approaches that you can take within the game, which means there are different tactics that will be used be each player.

The componets look great and are decently made. It's a nice change to see the diamond and triangle shapes as opposed to most square tiled games. I also liked the way the explorers move along the edges of the tiles. Rather than on the tiles themselves. It gave it a nice new feel and was something a bit different from most tile laying games.

I actually liked this game more than Goldland. It just has more of an exploration feel to it and seemed to play better. I think what really made the game shine was the incredible amount of things that can be purchased at the trade stations. With so many items available. Explorers are free to suit up for their trek in many different ways. This feel of customization really added to the feel and strategies in the game.

If you are looking for or like exploration games. This is one you don't want to miss.

Exploration is one of my favourite themes and so I was looking forward to trying Lost Valley. After one play I think it is a good game that evokes the exploring theme well, with lots of opportunities for combination moves that make an amusing narrative (I'm going to chop down two trees using my axe, load them in my cart, move two spaces along the river bank and then have a slug of whisky to get the strength to mine those two river gold tokens using my sieve). We totally missed the importance of the triangle tiles and our game got a bit bogged down as a result. I'd recommend working the triangles into the tile placement wherever possible. Looking forward to trying it again.

Very neat exploration and exploitation game.  An adventure game without the fantasy!  Quickly one of my my favorite games.

Exploration games are maybe not my thing, but I do like tile-laying games generally.  Lost Valley was ok, but it did feel a little dry and I doubt it would stand up to repeated plays.  It's not a bad game, but it isn't one I would go out of my way to suggest.

It can be compared with “Goldland” because of the theme but apart from that, this game puts you more to the test when it comes to make decisions when moving through the wild.
Good balanced game where action will lead to reaction. Iittle hint, do not move too far away from the river.

After two plays, there are some good ideas here, but the game clearly needs more development.  Where do I start?  The triangle tiles are needed to add variety and strategic options to the game, yet they're nearly impossible to get onto the board except for a couple spots along the base edge.  Perhaps players could each be given a token at the start of the game that can be used to place a triangle tile instead of a rhombus?  The cost for building a mine is too high.  Without a cart, a player cannot hold enough raw materials to both build and operate a mine.  As a consequence, others are likely to gain more from the mine than the builder does.  The event tokens are also too expensive in terms of time and materials, making them all but worthless.  There are not sufficient controls on the random layout of the board.  For example, in one of our games all of the tundra rivergold was separated from the river by a mountain range, making it useless.  There were a total of four pieces of rivergold available throughout that game, leading to a horrible experience for all.  Finally, the rules are poorly written and poorly organized.  For instance, there is no specification for what it means to move "along a river."  Can players move from one river branch to another adjacent but separate river branch, without a boat?  Another example: the rules and the play aids offer conflicting information on the cost of experiencing an event. 

Maybe the game could be repaired with some rules changes, but it's not worth the effort in its current form.  Even if Lost Valley is fixable, I'd never choose to play it over the similar but much better Goldland.  I've now permanently sworn off Kronberger games after my repeated disappointment combined with the bullying behavior of the proprietors.

MUST PLAY MORE.

The beautiful combination of play and theme is exactly what I needed at this time in my gaming career. I am very excited about this one. Only complaint currently is that I feel like it takes so long to actually accomplish anything. After playing Tikal I am considering developing an Action Point variant for Lost Valley. I really love this design though.

Also, only really want to play with 4. Makes it very hard to get it to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
One play with four players; very thematic and enjoyable, and should be a good every-once-in-a-whiler. One thing, though: in our game people were throwing tiles down as quickly as possible so as to have more on their side of the river than the other guys, and that spoiled some of the atmosphere of "exploring the wilderness." Know what I mean? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Preliminary rating that might rise with further play. We all liked the theme enough to feel the game was worth another go, but we also smell some balance problems. Rules are unclear in places and the translation is a bit dodgy. Traded when it didn't get back on the table after several weeks.

I think there's more depth here than I originally thought; by the end I realized how much strategy and maximization is involved.  It's another action maximization game, like Tikal or Mexica, but with more things to keep in mind.  Less pure, and more complicated.

A nice adventure game where ppl can "steal" from other player buildings, since once build, anyone can use them. However, this "stealing" is what makes the game any interesting and it's not as bad as it may sound.

I find it better than Goldland, but luck is still a factor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I rate this game very highly because it really does bring something original and interesting to the party. Alongside a strong and very well implemented theme (gold panning in an undiscovered valley) come some great mechanisms; you're collecting gold to win but need to spend it to be able to get better items; while progression is easier if you make equipment - but that equipment can then be used by other players. There's lots of randomness and luck, as the theme demands, as well as fun exploration (in the style of random tiles and items). All in all, a gracking game.

Nice thematic game about going to wilderness and washing gold nuggets from river or mining it from the rocky terrain. You can buy about dozen different items/tools/vehicles at the wilderness trading post, so there are nice mini-goals (e.g. 'I will get that boat to travel faster along the river as I plan to get my gold fast and effortlessly from the river').

The game has potential for even higher rating from me, so the current rating is initial rating.

Played twice with 3 and 4 players. Lost Valley has very nice components and is well-themed. It seems more interesting with 4 rather than 3 players - indeed I wonder why it was not designed for up to 5 players. I'm not keen on the role of chance in the game, but I must admit that it is appropriate to the theme.

RATING: 6
OK game.  We never got one triangle in at all...I think we were missing something in the way we layed tiles somehow, and not getting any triangles REALLY slows down the game.  If played again, I would be tempted to allow the triangle tiles to come out easier.

after several more plays and seeing errors in our rules interpretation, this is a pretty good one.  Worth playing every once in a while

Exploration: p/u & del:resource management:tile-laying:screwage

Quite a good exploration tile laying game with some very neat elements really adding to the fantastic theme.  Very fast turns, theme integrated into play, a dose of luck, multiple paths (dynamite does seem strong) and just plain fun. 

It is easy to see Goldland influenced this game and they are quite similiar while still being different in execution. In its defence it would be hard to make a good outdoor adventure game without including things like wood, fishing and a backpack. GL is a little more puzzle-like with no real screwage factor and this is more interactive and slightly more fun. I do like both about the same but they scratch the same itch so owning one is probably enough.

Oh and yes download the FAQ before playing, very short rules, a little too short...

RATING: 6
Quite disappointed with this one. Too long and fiddly for what it is. I felt like I had very little meaningful choices to make. Go here, pick up stuff. Go here, pick up stuff. Go here, buy stuff. The worst part of it all was how little you can do on a single turn. It takes 5 or more turns to collect resources to build a mine and get gold. There was a lot of sitting around and waiting. We eventually rushed the end game so that we didn't have to play any longer. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
I love the theme very much and this does a great job giving you the real feel of exploration. Yes, there is a deal of luck involved and the dynamite strategy is tough to beat, but overall it's a very enjoyable game.

Played a few times now...I really love the theme - maybe the theme-iest game I've ever played.  I love the feeling of exploring - as well the idea of inventory management as your backpack can only fit so much stuff!  My only challenge is that the dynamite seems to powerful...in future playings I might increase the cost of dynamite to 7 gold.

Game of exploration and prospecting. My experience with Lost Valley isn't particularly good. The game is certainly based on a sound idea and building the board from rhombe-shaped tiles is a fine piece of design.

But the game is burdened by a number of problems; first off, the rulebook is horrible, making the game seem extremely complex (which it isn't). The game also has a number of imbalances; the too high cost of mines being the most obvious and often-quoted one. Also, the game is quite slow-moving (at least with new players) and on the whole feels quite a bit fiddly.

Unfortunately, exploration games are a difficult genre to implement. Lost Valley might be more thematically strong than Goldland, but the various problems with LV drags it down. :(

Wow!  I've been on and off the fence with this game of exploration and resource management for far too long and I really like the dynamics of it a-lau-aught.  The special 'triangle' tiles are somewhat of a challenge to develop with the surrounding 'rhomboid' shaped tiles, but well worth the co-op effort 'if' a Trading Post can be drawn and placed.  My rating will most likely go up with more play.

Nice exploration game. Good quality components. Theme fits very well. Game has a certain uniqueness about it. Extra points for using whiskey as a means to get extra actions. There is a bit of luck in tile drawing and possibilities to exploit the work of others or blocking it, but that fits the theme of competing gold-diggers. Point of critique: works best with 4 and 4 players only.

Felt a little bit like playing an old fashioned computer adventure game, where you have to go here to get that and put it together with this to build that. The player mats even resemble the "inventory" screens on computer games. The game itself is a pleasant time-waster with nothing too taxing on the senses.

Had watched a couple of playings at BGG.con, found a copy online when I got home, and finally got it on the table this past weekend.  The river went very oddly in the game, so we actually ran out of the normal tiles first, and there was a ton of mining, unlike the other games I had seen.  I enjoyed myself, despite my unsuccessful horse and cart strategy, and look forward to trying several other strategies soon.  I don't think there is one optimum way to win, which is why I like the game, you have to adapt to the circumstances of what is revealed on the tiles, you can't just doggedly play the same thing everytime.

Exploration, gold mining, hunting and fishing, not to mention the funny-shaped tiles. This sounds like my kind of game, but something seems to be missing...can't put my finger on it though. Perhaps the tokens are just too tiny for my huge hands, I don't know..

OK game. The best part of Lost Valley is that every player "has to go" (that's not necessary but you really need those equipments) for shopping every now and then.

Lost Valley is a different kind of game and I'm ready to play it occasionally, but it's little bit boring.

A pretty exploration, tile-laying (rhombs & triangles) game.  It has a bit of a learning curve to it but only b/c of the menu items of options.  I didn't really like Goldland all that much but this one definitely felt more explorative.  Obviously exploring (finding tiles) is important but even moreso is planning efficiently (using your resources and building, acquiring, carrying all the "right" things necessary to find the diffent types of gold.  Planning well can overcome the luck factor of exploration as well as taking advantage of other players' potential plans (by following along).  In any game of exploration, luck is always involved and this one has a good balance of luck and skill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Exploration game where one seeks to have the most gold nuggets at the end of the game.  Mostly, one can gain nuggets from either river mining or mountain mining.  One can return to the trader's hut to purchase extra supplies that allow you to cut more wood, aim your gun better, fish more fish, or mine more gold among other helpful transportation items.  There's definitely a fine line between investing in extra supplies and saving your nuggets for points.  The most important thing to watch for is that your mines don't get poached by other players.  If one player is more successful using another person's mines, they will win since they can save their resources for the actual mining action instead of building the mine itself.

Very nicely designed exploration game.  I prefer this to Goldland.  The means of exploration itself seems to flow more naturally.  The limitations on movement and action make the game tense.

7/2007 First 4-player game was interesting.  There's LOTs to do with very limited time and resources.  Sifting for river gold with a cano was the winning move this time, but that won't necessarily be winning next time.  Mining for gold didn't pay of; It costs a lot to develop a mine and you're likely to get only half it's content.  Will try some other approach in another game.  Some early equipment apart from the cart seems good.

We've played this a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed it. It has a real Puerto Rico flavor to it with the resource management element. We are suckers for tile laying games as well, so this fits right in. The theme is fun and engaging. The only reason we don't buy it is because it really takes a round of play to be competitive. Unless it supports two player play, we usually play games with friends that have not yet played them. Lost Valley doesn't lend itself to this, since the experienced players usually handily beat the newbies.

The typical Kronberg tiles are put to very good use in this game of exploration and gold digging, whose only weakness might be a possibly foreseeable winner. If the latter should become less of a problem with more experience, it might very well climb to an 8.
 
Played once.

Update 2011 after another two plays:
Although the exploration part of the game is still enjoyable, everything else is a bit too tedious and fiddly. Apart from the resourcivitis that plagues most underdeveloped Euros, there is too much luck for a brain burner and too little adventure for, well, an adventure game. Since all tiles are in the mix from the start and you tend to get your equipment together in the first half of the game, the narrative tension dwindles towards the end with worthwhile tiles being removed further and further from the base. I'd play again, but see no further need to keep our own copy.

This game has been sitting on the shelf for quite a while, but lately I've tried it with my older son (four and a half years old) and he enjoys it. 

It has been compared to Goldland, but to me they feel totally different. I like Goldland better, and this game feels a bit mechanic (doing the same things over and over) but it's interesting enough...

Roads and boats redux. Just not my type of game, I guess. Basically you're trying to gather ressources that will allow you to gather more ressources down the road, and stay away as much as possible from the pack (but not too much!) so they don't steal the stuff you built. Not enough ways to prevent an opponent to follow his plan (unlike, say, Caylus), which removes a lot of the tension in the game. Most actions can be planned 3-4 turns ahead. Feels more like a puzzle to be solved than an interactive game. Like I said, just not my type.

RATING: 9
Fantastically fun exploration game that I find to be very well balanced with a ton of resource management and tough decisions.  Players explore the lost valley starting off with just a few supplies.  As players explore, new tiles are added to the board.  The goal of the game is to get the most gold by mining it out of rocks, out of the river or by discovering it.  One can build mines, canals (to divert the river in order to pan for river gold), saw mills, fish traps, etc.  Players can buy carts (to hold more goods, a horse (to move quickly and across the river) a boat (to move very quickly along the river, a fishing pole (get more food), a rifle (shoot animals for more food), an axe (get more wood), whiskey (for more movement points), etc.  You can only hold so many supplies and you need to watch out for fellow explorers who may piggy-back behind you and exploit the mines, etc. you build before you get a chance to mine them, etc.  You only have 2 action points per turn (3 if you have the whiskey) and everything has a price (a la Catan).  Probably a bit more gamey then Goldland.

Then it might well become a 9.

Played once with four players.  Players move around a parallelogram-based map to collect resources and build structures that allow them to gather gold.  The map starts out blank, and is only extended by players traveling to the edge of the map, whereupon they then place random tiles to extend the map.  This map extension is a cool feature, and seems like it should enhance replayability, but it means that the map created can be _very_ unbalanced.  For instance, in the game we played, one area (far from the base camp) was filled with mountain gold, forests, and food; two players got to reap gold there forever without moving, while the other two players got to run around collecting resources to get a pittance of gold in another area of the map.  This ability to create unbalanced maps wherein some players have no hope of winning is a big drawback for me; this would be a great game if it weren't for the unbalanced map possibility.

Tile-drawing, exploration type games are not usually my thing, but Lost Valley was actually quite fun.  In fact we played two games back-to-back so that says it was far from boring.  The various methods of collecting gold nuggets provide multiple paths to victory.  Sure there is the luck of the tile draw but planning is still possible.  Unfortunately my plan to get food by hunting animals with my rifle went very very wrong when I rolled a 3 or less on five consecutive tries and the opponent rolled a 6 each time.

This game is great, but didn't end up playing it as much as I had expected so lowering from a 10 to an 8 on that factor.  A hidden gem.  Has so many elements I love: exploration, planning, competition.  The variable board and bits are wonderful and the game does have English rules and parts as well as German and French.  I've played it multiple times now and have always wanted to play it again, right away!!  What a neat game...a true treasure in my collection.  Elegant design in so many ways....not too long, not too complicated, but challenging and most importantly FUN!!  High replay value as well!!  Many different courses to victory.  Start chopping trees, fishing and hunting to mine gold and win!

RATING: 6.5
Players explore for gold in the Klondike. Players explore drawing diamond shaped tiles and triangular shaped tiles. Mining for gold requires food and sometimes timber. There are a myriad of items one can acquire or build (buy cart, fishing rod, rifle, canoe, horse, saw, etc). Only played once with 4 players and it turns out we were playing wrong; you need 10 gold tokens to attempt to win, not 10 gold nuggets, which was the incorrect way we played. I thought there might be a lot of luck involved, but I need to play this properly before making an informed opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I played a prototype of this game quite a while ago - and I was fascinated by the fact, that luck seems not to be the dominant factor in this game although it's all about exploration.
I love exploration games and "Lost Valley" appeared as a perfect combination of a new mechanism and suspenseful, tactical play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Only one play so far, but I thought it was great.  The game is very open-ended, so it was hard to decide on a strategy for my first game.  I'm looking forward to the second game so I can avoid my previous mistakes (while probably discovering new ones! ;-)

RATING: 3
I played the game with Mario Lanza and he was correct that we played using the wrong rules. Unfortunately for Lost Valley, if we played by the correct rules, my rating might have been lower! You see, we thought the game ended when you collected a total of 10 gold NUGGETS. It's actually ends upon collecting 10 gold TOKENS (each containing 2-4 nuggets) and then returning to the Trading Post, which means the game would have lasted at least another hour, which means I may have been forced to give myself electric shocks to keep myself awake that long! There's no denying this is a beautiful game, and the components are super. The gameplay, though, is about as bland as it gets: Decide where to explore, flip the appropriate tiles and then do what you need to do to find gold. This is a game about resource management, but the way you go about this is tedious and boring. I felt more like I was playing a game about chit-collecting than I was exploring the game world. I saw so little potential here that I don't think I want to even try it a second time, as I doubt that extending the gameplay time will make my opinion of it improve. Sorry guys, but this is my literal sleeper of the year. ZZzzzz.

Quite a cagey exploration game. The limited resource allowance means it takes a great deal of time and effort just to get to second gear. Having to take two turns to do anything is thematically appropriate but makes for a kind of slog feel. The tile-built game board provides a different set of tactical considerations each time, but after one play I think a strategy of focusing on mountain gold is the winning one.

More thematic than an average eurogame. A great exploration game that can be played in a little more than an hour. Plenty of ways for victory. Some better than others depending on how game proceeds. Should you spend some gold for equipment and hope that investment to pay off or just try to end game quickly? I like how you're balancing between the two. Rules leave some little things without a clear explanations but FAQ here on geek is helpfull in most cases. One of the very few minuses of Lost Valley is that it requires exactly four players.

RATING: 6.5
Played twice.  The learning curve is steep, and the game's rounds feel longish if people don't know what they're planning to do.  This is because you can only carry out one action, so it usually takes 2-3 turns to accomplish something.  If others hem and haw on their turn, the game drags very quickly.  If played at a reasonable pace, this is not an issue.

The only real complaint is that the mines are too easy for others to 'claim jump' onto.  One possible (and easy) fix would be to allow two lumbers to be carried in the same two spaces instead of two spaces per lumber.  That would allow people to carry enough material to immediately mine a gold most of the time, giving the mine creator the lion's share of the riches - most of the time, and only if they plan well.  Will maybe try this next game.

RATING: 8
Luck is a huge feature, and it's under developed in that the lure of all these magic techs are aching to be tested in super combinations, but they all seem too expensive to get value out of before a non-invested player hurries the end of the game. And yet, when you do invest, you do tend to at least get back to where you might have been and sometimes the game goes long enough to get good payback. River gold seems too low in value - anyone concentrating on river gold has to ensure that no other person gets 3 or more mountain gold, otherwise they'll be toast, and they should try to steal a few of these themselves to help make it so. But great bits, great theme and quick turns make up for it all and I rarely knock back an opportunity to play.

Very, very good exploration and logistics game! The rules are very simple, the game couldn't be more German, and yet the game experience is really evocative of the gold rush. Whoever said that eurogames were devoid of theme is just plain wrong!

There's a good amount of luck, but it makes sense in the context and there's still enough depth to reward good play.

It's also extremely cheap (in Europe, at least) so there's absolutely no reason not to buy it.

Gold digging at its best. I liked the big number of equipment but while playing, it seemed as if quite a many of them are useless compared to some others.
Exploring is always fun but the game ends before anything can be truly achieved, so at the beginning you have to choose your tactics and I don't like that. It takes a lot more time than it feels while playing.

While I enjoyed the exploration / discovery aspect of this game, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Too many small fiddly aspects of the game made for a somewhat non-intuitive first-playing. For instance, traversing along the spines of each of the tiles, while it may be somewhat unique, was a little disorienting. The symbols on the tiles are a little hard to correlate to what they represent. And the differences between what can be carried in the rucksacke vs. the karte vs. .. , well let's just say I'm not quite sure which items (dry goods vs. raw materials vs. consumables) can be carried in which slot of the inventory pad. It's possible that more playings will result in more familiarity with the finer points of the game, because I really want to like this one.

RATING: 8
Lost Valley is a decent game.  I've played it 2 player a few times but I wouldn't consider myself to be a veteran.. so, take this rating with some salt.  The next time I get 4 people together to play games, it may be on the request.  

Good points - exploration, conquest, discovery, gold - and done well.
Bad bits - not alot of triangle use, a pantload of chits, forgettable rules.

Update: This game maintains its '8' status on account of the fact that I really want to play it, again, with at least 3 people.

A very fun exploration game of the gold rush.  Limiting each player to one action per turn keeps the game moving, and also allows you to react to your opponents latest moves.  Using your gold as purchasing power for special items is an element I really enjoy.  Anytime you have to spend VPs to get more VPs, that's a tough decision.  The theme of the game is great, and comes through in your purchases and your actions.  Though there are many things you can do in the game, they are simple and common sense.  Easy to learn, quick to play, but quite an interactive, challenging game.

I remember seeing this reviewed in Brett and Board awhile ago but wasn't really interested; however, that changed when I played a copy and it was an instant love (winning on first go made things rose-tinted). Since then I'm finding that not everyone shares my passion. The common complaint in four player session is that the game pace is slow, but more significant is the frustrating gameplay: you move, explore but can only do one thing (if you have no whiskey left), which for most is staccato in feel, rather than a sense of tension. As I'm the one explaining the game I don't feel this stop/start. Even if I wasn't explaining I find the game fascinating not only in theme, but also as a cost effective exercise in racing against others. One joy in the design is the use of the die to countdown game end which notches up the tension but also provides hope. I think newbies are overwhelmed by the gameplay and not interested in what others are doing. It is interesting to see that laid back personalities aren't put off by the frustration, where adrenal junkies are.

A game with Euro mechanics (somewhat reminiscent of Tikal) that doesn't forget to tell a great story. I like the setting (gold prospecting), I like the components, I like the fast-paced turns (make a move, take an action), I like the wide range of action choices and I like the diversification promoted by the upgrades you can purchase at a hefty cost. At the start of the game it seems terribly difficult to do anything but by the end we were frantically racing across the board to mine the last gold before the river froze over. Although there's not a huge amount of direct interaction, it's an immersive, laughter-filled, shared experience and I'm looking forward to my next game already.

Played couple of times and it seemed fun. There's some heavy optimizing going on under the hood, so the players need to be careful with the initial strategy. Overrall, the theme is excellent and I always was excited about the exploration of the game area.

Lost Valley mixes worker placement with RPG elements and serves it with a slice of action/movement point dessert.  Each turn is insignificant in itself, which technically should make the game go fast (but not with AP-prone players).  The theme and the mechanics are tight.

RATING: 5
After several plays, I find I'm not really interested in playing this again. Lost Valley alternates between boring (when there are no other players near you) and irritating (the rest of the time).

The boring parts: if there's no one near you, it's usually obvious what you should be doing, and you're just turning the crank. The irritating parts: if there's someone near you, then they can leech off of what you're doing. The player who does the most building is likely to lose because of that, yet turtling and waiting for someone else to do it (so that you can be the leech) makes for a slow and boring game.

Plays poorly with three players, so you really need exactly four people.

I expected more of this game, so I think I might be giving it an unfairly low rating because of that.  I felt like I was just walking in circles, but I guess that's thematic for a wilderness exploration game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A bit more to think about than Goldland in that tiles need to be prepped often before the action can be taken (or one doesn't have enough actions left), so timing and relative proximity of other players is more critical.  But plays a bit slower than the other two.  I can see that experience will have a benefit in this game, but the question remains - how steep is the learning curve.  Does one get proficient after a handful of games (as I expect) or is it a bit longer?

The exploration component of this game is great and makes each game different.  The limited actions make for agonizing decisions.  This is a game I should be good at, but I always seem to overestimate how many turns the game will run, and am left still building my position while someone else is returning home with their gold.  Plays better when players don't immediately spread out and burn through all the tiles quickly.

Deserves the title of 'best exploration game out there' (maybe on par with Goldland). The theme in Lost Valley works very well. You really get the sense of exploration when playing.

The idea behind this exploration game is a simple one, and everything about it from theme to playability is executed well through the entire game system. Once you've got a bit of experience behind you the game moves along at a quick pace and you can start enjoying it. Unfortunately it suffers if the players don't cooperate to some degree in that the game stalls with no player willing to blink and forcing players to try and get some space between themselves and the others. This can be a bit frustrating. Still reasonably fun though.

RATING: 7
Players are prospectors looking for gold in a hidden valley.  To do so they explore the surroundings; build mines, traps, canals and sawhills; fish; hunt, and cut trees for wood.  They can use some gear that they find or buy to help them in their labor.  At first, you can be suspicious about lack of playing interaction, but when you play you find that it isn't true.  All the game is about getting advantage of the things that other players build up.  Certainly, it is the best exploration game that I've played.

Here's a lesson in making sure people hate a game. Teach it to them, but don't point out that X or Y will be important as the game goes along. 

Then you take advantage of your knowledge of those important things, and by the time the newbies catch on you're destroying them. Isn't this fun?! 

The same person taught some friends Roads & Boats, and they hate that now for the same reason. 

Well done, BGG admin who lives in Colorado! You're the winner!

RATING: 7
I ended up liking this game much more than I thought I would.  The game really has a feeling of exploration and the twist at the end with the player that has the most gold adds a lot.  Even though a player might think they will win upon getting the tenth gold marker, during the journey back to the trading post, the other players can spend those last turns mining and maybe pull out a win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players are prospectors trying to mine gold from mountains and pan gold from streams. Some similarities to Tikal. Players need food, timber, and tools to do any work. They must hunt, buy tools, cut down trees, and build canals. Players may also purchase or locate gear to make these actions more profitable. Each player gets a player card to enforce gear and materials limits. The game does a good job of capturing the feeling of being a prospector. I'm luke warm about it. I like that you can invest in structures like saw mills for increasing the effectiveness of gathering timber, but these structures are useable by ANY PLAYER. This means most players will avoid such structures unless they can use it up first or if they're very isolated from other players. I didn't like that. I did like the map tiles and exploration aspect. The game has a strong solitaire aspect, you can frequently just ignore your opponents. I'm luke warm about this title, but I'd give it another shot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very overwhelming for the first-time player with so many tiny chits and their costs to keep track of. Charming well-themed game though, and I'm seeing more with each play. There's a big balancing act between staying close to leech off the efforts of the other players, and exploring all by yourself when you have the gear to ransack the surrounding landscape. Love the exploration and public works. Wish the triangle tiles can be easier to bring into play.

Problem is this game is only good with 4 players, because the player who wanders off alone in the 3-player game doesn't seem to do much. I wonder if 2-player will work if you constrain explorers to one side of the river.

Great stepping tone from Eurogame to Ameritrash, since it conveys the adventure feel without actual magic, combat and death. Nothing beats hanging around near your opponent, waiting for him to build a mine, then running in and using your dynamite to swipe all the mountain gold before he can. I have moved on though: I want to kill my fellow explorers instead of just being mean to them.

Not made up my mind about this game yet. Much less interaction than I hoped. The game definitely has a good thematic integration, but at it's core is a sort of efficiency euro. The leeching of other people's effort is an interesting aspect - probably the same people need to play it a couple of time for this to fully develop. 

For now: not loving it. Too much optimising, not enough interaction. Theme works, but that's not enough. Maybe really needs more plays with same group. 

Traded it away - what looked like a thematic euro-ish game had too much optimisation, too little interaction and showed how boring gold prospecting was.

If I were the sort to wish that I had invented a game, I could do a lot worse than to imagine that I had invented this gem. Although the rules presentation is a little strange, once you begin playing you will discover the economy of the game.

In Lost Valley, which incidentally plays best with 4 (by a loooong shot - I'm not inclined to play with 2 or 3), you are a prospector sniffing out gold in the Yukon Territory. On each turn, you may move somewhere along a tile edge. If you move to the edge of the playing space, you will draw one or more tiles to fill out the landscape. This makes the game "board" different every time - a mechanic I really like. Then, you can do different sorts of things, like hunt, fish, chop wood, pan for river gold, or dig for mountain gold. Performing these activities is aided by purchasing items at the trading post or hunting/fishing/chopping - and in some cases, specific items are items are required. For example, you cannot build a mine without wood, and so you must chop wood down on a forest tile and bring that wood to a mountain tile in order to build a mine. Whiskey, purchased at the outpost, allows an extra move!

Lost Valley promises great potential for player interaction. Letting other players build mines, and then moving in to steal their gold is extremely amusing. And so some careful planning is required in order to avoid players stealing "your" gold. There's a lot more to say about this game - but just go get a copy and play it. It's excellent.

Man, oh man, is this game good.  I'd been hemming and hawing about picking this up for a year now and now that I've finally played it, I'd bummed that I never picked it up. The bits are gorgeous, and the game play is clean and the theme is steeped into the system.  This is a must own and my next buy.  What other game will you hear "I'm going to drink my moonshine so that I shoot this here rat for food, run to the hills and use my dynamite to blow up the mine and steal the gold!"  There is potential for multiplayer solitare, but there is a nice amount of interference and positioning so that people can't jack the goods before you can get it. This is really the best exploration/pick up & deliver game that I've had the pleasure to play.  Why play Roads & Boats or Goldland when this beauty is around?

First game was pretty rough getting started.  I started to feel more interest as we got used to the rules, though I feel like the exploration aspect can get lost very easily once people start to find advantageous positions and hunker down to collect as much gold as possible.  Downtime is pretty bad with 5 players, I'd probably never play again with that many and I'd think twice playing with 4.

This game is kind of intimidating at first because of the different chits, the rather poorly translated rules (not horrible, just not clear in some situations), and the only partially translated character cards. However, after explanation and play, it's a breeze and a fun sort of pick up and deliver game. After playing this and Return of the Heroes within a week, I'm not sure which I like better, but they're both fun and thematic games.

My rating should be taken with a grain of salt, because I've only played 2-player so far, while the game is designed for 3 or 4. I do think it's cleverly done. I enjoy both the theme and the decision-making process presented. Some of the abstractions feel wrong to a player with my wargame simulation background, notably the ability to speed river movement with a canoe and simultaneously use a wagon to carry extra items, but all in all a better job of evoking the theme than in most Euros.

RATING: 8
It's "Carcassonne", but fun!  Okay, that statement is both overly simplified and overly unfair to poor Carc, but that was my initial impression!  I picked up this one for my wife because she enjoys games that involve exploration and collecting things, but I was surprised by how much I've enjoyed it too!  A few of the concepts seem rather confusing initially, but once a player is familiar with all the little details, turns flow quite smoothly and there is minimal downtime.  I think the coolest feature of the game is how open-ended it is - you just get out there and do what you think is going to get you the most gold (and my customized starting inventory variant... http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/431412 ...adds even more open-endedness to the game).  The artwork is all hand-painted which is pretty neat, although many of the images are simply too small to be able to tell at a glance what you're looking at (which makes "Keythedral" still more appealing from an artistic standpoint).  I think this game would not play as well with 3, but with 4 players or 2 players controlling 2 prospectors each (one on each side of the river, unless a boat is purchased), the game plays out very well.  "Lost Valley" was a delightful surprise!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

[Kronberger Spiele 2004 edition] {Exploration, Gold digging; modular board, dice-rolling, resource management; optimal 4p} I like exploration game and I like to have some in my game collection. I came across Lost Valley when I was searching for exploration game. The exploration theme really attracts me and it includes Indiana Jones! LV soon becomes the gem of exploration game in my collection.

LV is very thematic and has nice player interaction. Players have to plan for at least 5 steps ahead in the exploration; otherwise, they will find that their earnings are shared by many others. Some players may take advantages of others build works. I don't think it's a serious problem because it's the problem of the players but not the problem of the game. Actually, I think the game system is quite balanced.

LV is not available in English publishers, but the game itself comes with multilingual components. The quality of the game bits is good but a tray should be included to hold the game parts nicely like Attika.

It'd be much better if it can be played by 5-6 players despite longer down time and game time. The FAQ mentions that expansions are coming. I am looking forward to playing them.

RATING: 7
The game is over when somebody with ten or more gold markers leaves the valley (not gold nuggets, each marker is for 1-4 nuggets). You need to plan carefully in this game and e.g. buy the right things at the shop. You'll want to buy a cart to be able to transport more things, but there are only two carts in the game, so others may beat you to it, and maybe you should choose a different strategy. If you build something, the other players can also use it, but if e.g. nobody builds a mine, no gold can be mined. You need to choose the right time to do things, and use your whisky when you need an extra boost (for extra actions).

First impressions: Box and contents bigger and better than I imagined. A lot of rules for a simple game, but all of them are straightforward.

After one play: A very nicely themed game. Exploration is great fun on its own. You'll need a few turns to form a strategy for mining, though. Things tend to be quite interlocked, and a player will have to figure out the dependencies. Our first game had to be aborted after two hours, as everybody was busy checking out the endless possibilities of play. Looking forward to playing again. Excellent!

A very open-ended game; it feels like there's a lot of room and possibilities for how to explore and how to make money. Its got a lot of neat features.   Playing it feels like an excercise in frustration; there just doesn't seem to be any way of getting things done without other players stealing most of your points.  This may be more of a problem with my playing than with the game. After getting some advice, focusing on getting river gold to gear-up early and spreading out before trying to mine, I think this problem may be dealt with.

A decent, but mildly flawed game, that everyone else seemed to like a lot more than I did.

It runs about 30 minutes too long for what it is and there are too many options that aren't appealing enough and so don't seem to get used (a canoe??).

I like the 2 different values of gold (river gold vs. mountain gold) which keeps scores hidden but restricts the effect luck can have on the game.

I suspect, and have been told, that the game is pretty similar from play to play and I can see this being a major problem over numerous plays.

I had a lot of fun playing this. Since the number of things you need to do for a task are split up over a few turns I think one person who doesn't plan their turns while others are playing can grind this game to a halt. Turns have to be about 3 seconds.

I don't think it's bad like some make it out to be. I wish there was more room for some wares because it REALLY gets tight. Makes for some good decision making. The limited supply of some wares direct your strategy. May be a problem in future playings.

03 DEC 2010 - In my 3 games total so far I did horribly, then really well, then horribly. There are so many ways to play and approach the game, plus depending on what the other players do (and how many there are) can really change this game up. Is it time to play this game again?

Lost Valley has possibly the best exploration of any game I've played.  It all feels very thematic, too.  There are a lot of options for actions and gear, so I feel like there is a lot of strategy to be found.  I can't think of any other games that really compare.  Very well done considering it was made in 2004.

One of the most thematic games I've played. Tense and interesting from start to finish, you really feel like you're finding gold. Too bad it really works only with four players: with three it's unbalanced since two of the players will go to the one side of the river while one player gets to dig all the gold from the other side.

My rating may go up a bit if we play a 4 player game, but our 3 player game of this was lopsided in favor of the guy on the riverside by himself. The Game seems to end too quick also. Doesn't seem to have room to develope as much as I was hoping for.

Good little adventure game with interesting mechanics. It's tough traveling back to base camp every time you need something, and making the right plans for each journey is a gamble. Additionally, you never know what kind of luck you will or won't have once you get to where you want to go. Hmm, sounds exactly like the Klondike gold rush. So as I explain it, I appreciate its thematic accuracy even more than while I was playing it.

RATING: 8
Starts off kinda slow, but picks up pace about 2/3 of the way in.  I'd almost say that the starting player has an advantage, since they get first pick on exploring.  A couple of good draws and they can create a place for a triangle tile and have almost exclusive access to it unless someone just follows them wherever they go.  I'm learning that in a three-player game, going off on your own is a surefire way to lose when the other two players are taking advantage of each others' experiences.  I'm still trying to convince myself that's it's possible to win without the box of dynamite.

(Two plays) Not much to point to and say is 'wrong' with it, but it didn't really excite me. I felt that poaching others claims was a little too big an effect, especially with plenty of dynamite sticks running around. Well... the second game didn't have as much dynamite. My impression is that with good play the poaching effect might be minimal, but also that getting good enough at the game isn't really worth it.

A great exploration game simulating the gold rush. Players are prospectors traveling the land in search for gold. 

The game reminds me of Plunder in many ways. It is a very thematic game with lots of details and facets which create a rich and engrossing experience.

For players who like theme, you will not want to overlook this game. I can't imagine a better exploration simulation.

The game takes a while to set up and play, so we don't get this on the table as often as other games.

This is definitley one of my favorites that never gets old because of its very solid design and randomness that leads to a new experience each time. . .the options are always different as well. . .sometimes you want a horse and dynamite, other times you take the boat and the cart. . .the limited amount of items makes for a special challenge each time out. . .highly recommended!

This game has amazing potential. The best theme I have ever seen and certainly solid gameplay. However, small annoyances (such as a triangle tile placement limitations and a superior dynamiteman strategy) prevents me from making this a 9 or 10 game. Nevertheless, I highly recommend buying this game if you can get a hold of one.

Saw this mentioned in a journal by Chris Roberts as being a good adventure-like game without combat.

I finally played this at BGG.CON.  I really liked it.  There is just a touch of player interaction; just enough to keep it interesting, but not enough to change the focus.  The focus is on exploration and exploitation of resources, and it makes for a great variation on an adventure game.  Too bad it is only for 4 players.

I just played again, and I really should have printed out a faq first.  There were alot of unanswered questions in the rules.

Very thematic game, exploring and mining for gold, buying equipment as soon as you can afford it to maximise storage and gold removal. And of course trying to empty your newly constructed mine before someone else drops in and nicks it!

We play 2 player games with both explorers on one side of the river. A fine game! Not including set up, games take 30-45 minutes this way.

Interesting prospecting game, where you build up the terrain as the players explore it. Outfit yourself with horses, dynamite, rifles and whiskey, then set out to find the gold in them thar hills.

Can be quite confrontational, as there's no ownership of mines, so one player can spend a lot of effort to buy the materials to create a mine, then another player can swoop in and get the gold while you're away.

Very good, fun exploration and "pick up and deliver" game. So many options and only so few actions you can take - very hard to actually get anything done, especially on your own. Do not stray off on your own - it is very hard and not very profitable being a lone gold digger, and a lousy hunter, far out in the wilderness. I knew this, but was still tempted to just go one step further to see what was around the next river bend, and "got lost", until another trading post appeared at the spring of the river but by then there was little time left.

RATING: 4
I have to give this game an immense amount of credit for simulating so well the feel of the era it is trying to represent, and doing so without TOO complex of a ruleset.   Fundamentally this is a game about knowing when to switch from increasing your efficiency (by spending early VP's to acquire better equipment) to making the run for the victory (by snatching the required number of VP chits). What annoys me is that because you have to return to your home base in order to upgrade, and additionally there is alot of having to return to place A in order to get more of resource x which is required to obtain resource y from place B, and back and forth, the ratio of important decisions to time spent actualizing them is a little low for my tastes, especially since turns are not simultaneous.

First impression: A bit luck driven and it punishes players for acting and awards predators, lurking in the backgound, that's the down time.

very sturdy components; my very favourite style of pencil illustrations - lonely yukon, klondike woods and rivers. The cardboard evokes a true sense of the barren cold, I can almost smell the smoked salmon and hear a crackling camp fire.

it's kind of like a mini Roads and Boats; and in that sense, i like it.  There may be some balance issues, with mines for one, and with the limited carts for another.  Mines seems to seriously punish the builder of the mine.  The limitation on the number of carts is also contentious.  However, it does have a neat aspect of exploration versus development, and is relatively quick.

Lost Valley is a very cool exploration game. It features Tile Placement at its core, but it's almost an economic engine building game. You have to manage your resources, make tough decision as you can't possibly carry all the gear and resources you would like to have along.

The best part might be how thematic it is in capturing the feel of exploration, and that it still plays in just 60 minutes, even including the rules explanation.

Fantastic game!

One nitpick is how it is many times better to exploit the work of others, and then turn-order becomes very important, but there's no mechanism in the game that allows for changing of the turn order.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Marred by a burdensome rule set and an overlong play duration.  The thematically densed Lost Valley still ended up more like a chore than fun.  The exploration and the tile placement was probably the best and cleverest feature for the game.  However, the cyclical process of collecting raw materials, exchanging for tools, and finally the acquisition of gold became a repetitive exercise that I found little joy in.

Not recommended for three because inevitably the game will end up with two competing over resources on one side of the river leaving the odd man free reign of the other side.  Although it supports multiple languages, it seems that there is only one set of player aide and character sheet in English.  Which to me was an awkward decision and an annoying inconvenience.

The exploration in this is superb fun!  There are a few slight vaguenesses in the rules which your group will need to make agreements on, but no show-stoppers.  For instance, no more than one prospector can be on an intersection of tiles, and no more than two if that intersection is along the river bank:  Can you pass through that "full" intersection, though, as long as you don't stop there.  To us, "Yes" seems a very sensible answer.  There are  plenty of angles you can take on this game in order to try to excel, so in addition to the exploration itself making each game fresh, the number of strategies available, as well, should make every game of this interesting to play.

After our first playing of it, one of the other players said, "Honey, I have a new game I want to get."

All I can say about this game is that you'd better freakin' read the FAQ where it states that the game can be ended by returning to the trading post with 10 gold MARKERS rather than the 10 gold nuggets stated in the rules.  After 3 games of playing by the rules, nothing made any sense.  Looking forward to playing it properly.

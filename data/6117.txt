GAME: Nobody but Us Chickens
RANK: 3876
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun card game that's great to play with your kids.  I'd imagine we'll take this on holiday a lot and if there's a rainy day, it's perfect.

Fun for adults and kids alike.  I suppose it's a little like Hearts in that you can win good cards and bad ones with tricks.  A lot simpler than that and with a fun theme - but nice.

All of the members of our group gave this game a '7', because, well "it's just fun". There's not a whole lot of strategy here, in fact one of the players chose cards to play at random and came in 2nd place. The art is Warner Bros-ish, which is effective for this type of game. The production value is first rate, and comes with everything you need to play, including a score pad and a pencil (sharpened!)

I heard a lot of good things about this game.  So without any prior rules read I decided to pick it up on a whim to play with some of my younger cousins and siblings (ages 6 to 12).  After opening the box, looking over the components, and giving the rules a quick read through I was a little worried that the game would be TOO simplistic and ultimately uninspired and boring.  BUT this game proved my suspicions WRONG!  Yes the rules are simplistic (with the game easily taught in a minute) but as a whole Nobody But Us Chickens makes a great entry point for bluffing/ simultaneous action games.  A lot of fun for kids, with kids, and gives enough to keep the gamer in me happy.

As a sides note, the game components themselves don't take a lot of space (just a deck of cards), making this an excellent game to take on travels and bust out at hotels or wherever you find the time to game.

RATING: 5
Okay bluffing/guessing game that I enjoyed more for being a new title rather than anything else.  The graphics are cool, and the rotating Head Fox and Top Dog mechanic is a nice touch, but this genre already has enough better games in it for me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played a four-player game and enjoyed it, though I would call it more of an influence game than a trick-taking game.  You try to out guess the other players and earn the most points by either capturing chickens and/or saving them from the foxes and rats that want to catch them for dinner.  A solid, light, filler game that seems like it would play better with five or six players than it does with four.  It is also a game where the theme of the game helps in explaining the rules.

RATING: 6.5
Like a lot of childrens games and a fair number of other games this one has the familiar second guessing what your opponent is going to do element. I guess I'm at the point where this doesn't seem like strategy to me. It can be fun but there is no reason to own more than one of these games in your collection. Just took a look to see what BGG calls that type of game. BGG calls it Bluffing. I'd recommend you do an advanced search using bluffing and a rating of at least 7.5 and see what turns up. I wonder if anything will. Ok, as it turns out only one game did. Dune. It does have bluffing in it and much more. I guess I'm not the only one who thinks bluffing isn't enough to carry a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good fast card game. Got to anticipate what your opponents plan or count cards, more fun if the players talk a lot, e.g.  "now I put this for you guys, just send your fox its worth it, believe me". Simple fun.

Pointless game of card selection followed by the card resolution. Gaining points is done by either using your rat, fox, or dog cards. Catching a leader is impossible.

A very silly game of bluff except with a full complement of players it becomes a bit of a crap shoot. With a few less, you've some chance of working out the playing styles of each player and capitalising on it. I know its a filler, but I think there's better fillers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's all about predicting what your opponents will do. I generally dislike that kind of game, although this one is more tolerable than most. Game play isn't very interesting unless you have at least five players, but the game feels lengthy with any more than three players, so what to do?

Good game for a younger audience. Limited value for an older audience as the best play in a given situation is too often obvious. I personally prefer Hick Hack im Gackelwack, which shares a similar theme and some mechanics, even though it involves more luck.

Light game probably best played with children but fun once in a while with adults too just for the group think aspect of it.

RATING: 7
(As of [b]1[/b] play) It would be easy to dismiss this, but it is actually a great bluffing, second-guessing, psychological thriller disguised as some filler fluff about chickens. Ludicrously simple, but one of the best games of its genre that I have played. Fun fun fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a great filler with some excellent bluffing moments. Extremely simple to teach/learn and good with young children. Not a huge amount of strategy as this is more about reading your opponents and knowing when to go for it and when to change strategies to act more unexpectedly.

Always feels like a game of "chicken" as you try to hold on for a big score but hope that no-one else snatches the points out from under your nose. It is really fun and the simplicity makes the bluffing become the focus, as it should be. The only con is that the cards are quickly getting bent.

I've won 3 out of 4 times and the one I lost was very close.  This is not a game of luck - small kids will rarely win.

We have fun with this one as a family. The theme makes it enjoyable and the kids get into the whole chickens/foxes/dogs theme. A fun blind bidding game that is very easy to teach. 6year old had no problem whatsoever learning it in 10 seconds.

A very simple doublethink game -- easy to teach, and no matter how the first hand goes, people will understand the game by the second hand and then you're off to the races.

But is it fun? It's more fun than most games you could easily play with non-gamers. And yet it's rare that I'm in the situation of really wanting to game with non-gamers instead of accepting that now is not the time to game. It does happen, though.

I found this in a dusty corner of John's shelf.  I was about to ignore it when he said "I'd forgotten about that.  It's a great little family game". And you know, he was right.  We played it with 6, and my 10 year old son won twice!  Well, I had to buy it and we've been having fun with it ever since. The main activity you will be engaged in is trying to outguess your opponents. It's simple, fast (simultaneous play) and the theme enhances the experience. Edit: we now play with added chicken hat.

RATING: 5
Fun little game.  Good for kids, as many have mentioned.  Works better with 4-6 than with less players.  I would prefer a random hand to the preset ones so that card counting is not needed.  Although perhaps it would just be too random then.  Whatever...doesn't really matter as this is just a game to play with kids.

Strange little game.  Lot of bluffing (or chaos, depending on your outlook).
Good for a few laughs when the Fox is forced to heat a batch of sickly chickens, or 2 Guard Dogs show up and both are sent away empty handed.  But really kind of light-weight and not the kind of game I enjoy.  Of course, I was playing with adults--probably this is better with kids when expectations are adjusted accordingly.  For kids, I'd rate it a 7.

Nobody but us Chickens is a simple game in which the players compete to collect the greatest score using simultaneous action selection. "Score" in this instance is points for stealing the best and greatest number of chickens from a poultry farm.
The players have identical decks of cards- some show chickens of various quality, the others show foxes (come to steal the chickens), dogs that protect the chickens etc. Players select cards simultaneously, all are revealed together. If only chickens are played, the "coop" jackpots. Foxes take the pot if there are no dogs played. If dogs and foxes are played, the dogs "rescue" the chickens, but if dogs are played without foxes there is no effect and the coop jackpots. There are some other cards but fundamentally that's it. Repeat three times, scoring after each. Short and sweet.
Yes, it's a kids game: rock/paper/scissors with bells and whistles. But it is good: there is so much bluff and counterbluff that it works really well as a filler for hardcore gamers

A fun simultaneous revelation game in the vein of Pick Picnic, played over 9 rounds, where people are trying to guess when best to play their big scoring cards - the fox, the rat and the dog, when other players aren't playing theirs - and when otherwise to play off their various chickens which provide the points. Best at the max 6 players. Watching the groupthink change over multiple rounds always provides some fun moments (when everyone plays their rat on the first round for instance). Enjoyable.

Although mechanically similar to Hick Hack in Gagelwack, for me NBUC is better because: a)there is less luck involved as each player has an identical deck, so by watching cards played and the rotation of the king cards, you can relate to players' hands and consider potential plays; b)the pooled points are accessible to everyone, increasing the focus and drama of the jackpot win; c)quicker and less fiddly in round set up and resolving card play. Only played with 4 so far but I suspect it will be more fun with 5 or 6 players, so rating may go up.

Wasn't keen when I read it was a tricktaking game. But it is nothing of the sort. It's a terrific guessing game with elements of bluff. Friends whinge about it being luck but I've never lost! Love the steely resolve you need to make big plays. Reminds me of the tension of poker. It also provides one important element Euro-card games sorely miss: fun. Laugh-out-loud, point-the-finger and trash-talk fun. Unlike American games that attempt the same it doesn't overstay its welcome. Question its longevity but at the moment the perfect filler.

A silly game with lots of luck yet quite tense. It plays in 5min per player involved so that's a plus. In this game you'll have to base your decisions on what others think about what other people are thinking about them! It is a lot of fun to play nevertheless.

Excellent psych-out game with a party feel.  Blind bidding with a rock-paper-scissors component as foxes, rats, and guard dogs fight for control over a variety of sick and healthy chickens.  Especially fun when you play it multiple times with the same group.

RATING: 6
A quick game of set collection (sort of) and bluffing. Feels very much like Pick Picknic in a card game version, but I'd rather play the latter.

--- Summary ---
Players have an identical set of cards in hand (with different backs): 6 chickens (values -1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4), fox, rat, and guard dog. A random player is the Fox King, and another the Top Dog to start.

Each "trick", player pick and reveal a card simultaneously:
- all chickens: leave them in center
- dog(s), no foxes/rats: add dogs to your score pile
- foxes/rats (no dog): starting with Fox King and going clockwise until all chickens taken, players take a chicken from center. Rat players only take 1 chicken total. All taken cards, and played fox/rat, added to your score pile
- dog(s), foxes/rats: starting with Top Dog and going clockwise, all dog-players take a chicken from the center as above; fox/rat players take cards back; all taken cards go to score piles
After 9 cards played, score VP for all chickens taken.

At end of hand, pass Top Dog and Fox King markers to the left. Play 1 hand per player. Player with most total VP wins!

See my review. I usually prefer meatier games, but this makes a nice light and quick game of second-guessing.  

My two-year old son likes this ("the chicken game").  He doesn't grasp all the rules, but he knows when he plays a fox or a rat, "It goes over there" to a separate pile.

I like it's fast pace, the bluffing aspect, and how it's easy to learn and has a wide appeal.  I remember Kelly O outguessing us every single time, so much so it was becoming scary!  I'd like to play it more often.

[Dancing Eggplant Games 2003 edition] {Farming, kid; simultaneous action; optimal 5-6p} {basic 7, 'health' 7} Interesting family double-guessing game. It's hilarious to see someone played a fox / rat with a dog or a dog without predators! Or, watching someone is forced to get the sick chickens! 

There is no strong strategy in this game but you can use the first one/two rounds to understand the mentality of other players.  More players, more fun but game is longer. The rule is very simple and clear. It can be learnt and taught within 3 minutes. Timing is very important in this game. To get more chickens, players must determine the right time to play a dog, fox or rat.  The health variant can be used, but I would make it 2-point bonus instead.

The quality of the cards is quite disappointing. The cards must be protected with card sleeves to increase its durability. Without protection, they will wear card with several plays. The game is a bit over-priced with the content and the quality. Actually, I don't like game packaging with pencils and score-sheets.  It just drags up the cost without improving game play. I would rather this is produced with a small box with cards for more efficient storage (esp. when I have many games.)

This is an excellent game for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

The game is a solid 30 minutes of fluff.  There are some interesting 
decions to be made.  However is does use a mechanic I am not truly fond of which is Simultaneous blind play.  You have to guess what your opponents may do.  to lovers of bluffing games you will like this one but I am not fond of this mechanic unless I have some control.  Although I have to admit I like Dragon Delta and Diplomacy this mechanic for such a lite game is not my taste.

PS  I know the author and consider him a friend so take the notes above with that in mind.

Wife loves it.  Daughter loves it.  It's quick.  It's fun.  And it's really cheap at most places.  I got it for $4 at a Tanga sale with no shipping.  Best deal around for a fun family card game that even my 3 year old could play.  Deal!  Addendum:  Tried it with various groups of students at my high school.  They all loved it.  Truly unfortunate that BGG doesn't have a separate site for fun games.  I literally don't even look at the top 100 anymore.  The site is not balanced--all long, brain burner games with the uncommon exception.  I'll stick with the 300-3000 level games.

Nothing more than a guess what the other players are going to pick type game. Basari/Edel, Stein, & Richt is much better for that style of game. Best with 4 players With 5-6 the game becomes too random. Four at least feels slightly strategic.

Nobody but us Chickens is like a brand new car,  coated in quick drying invisible paint. 

It all sounds and looks so good at first glance - but it won't be long before you demand a return......of your money back from the car - or in the case of the game - of the time that was embezzled while playing it.  This game has serious limitations in it's longevity - especially so when played within the same group.

Considering the bare bones approach to the design,  I found the sickly chicken to be somewhat revealing in this manner.  Pick Picknic offers a little more in this genre,  but only by a smidgen. 

For me,  Felix The Cat In The Sack scratches this itch much better ( pun intended ) and in a much more significant way.

Everyone starts with the same cards, chickens, a dog, and 2 predators (rat & fox).  Play a chicken (worth points) and it goes in the coop. Play a fox to steal all the chickens and gain points.  Play a dog when another player plays a fox to take the chickens since you saved them.
What's the catch?  You do this at the same time.
Play a dog and no one played a fox?  Chickens just stay in the coop and you wasted your only dog card.  Play a fox and everyone else played a sickly chicken worth -1 point and you'll be sorry.  If there's multiple dogs/foxes, you have to divide the chickens, so you may only end up with 1 sickly chicken.

Example:
We all have 2 cards (rounds) left.  I have a chicken and a fox.  Did Josh already play his dog?  Is Will going to play his dog this round or next round?

Normally, when a game is short, I see that as a positive thing.  This game is very fast to play, but unfortunately, there's not much too it.  You can randomly play cards in 80% of your turns, and probably do better than the players who try to psych each other out.

It's not good for kids either, since the rules are a bit too fiddly for them.  There were a lot of edge cases that I didn't catch at first, and this is not good for a game designed to be short and easy to play.

There don't seem to be enough foxes, rats, or dogs to do much out-thinking in this game, and it's so much like Hick Hack in Gackelwack (in theme and mechanics) that it's inevitable that the two games will be compared.  Frankly, I'd rather play HHiG.

An great game for mixed kids and adults, especially if those involved are new to 'real' games.  You can teach people to play in a minute, and gamers and non-gamers alike have a pretty good time.  4 year-olds should be able to handle it pretty easily, and have a chance against adults.

Best game I've ever owned.  Been collecting Football Board games for almost 40 years.  Grew up playing Nintendo Tecmo Bowl Football thru high school.  Waited a long time find a board game that allows as much creativity, flow and quality football gamesmanship as Techno Bowl offers.  Hats off to Brent Spivey.  Cleaver game mechanics, excellent components and plain and simply More Fun than all the rest.  It gets a 10 from me!

Own prototype copy, and it's an excellent game. Blew me away to be honest. I'm not a huge American Football fan (I enjoy it, but I'm not super into it) but this game is great. Just from the perspective of game mechanics it's worth checking out, doubly so if you like football.

RATING: 8.4
Rating based on prototype and subject to change.  Extremely fun football game that shocked me how deep and clever it was.  The activation system utilizing the Apocalypse World dice curve is outstanding and revolutionary in the context of a sports game.  No other game I've played has felt this dynamic or energetic.

It feels like an evolved gamer version of Battleball with a huge amount of additional depth while still being very easy to internalize and understand.  It's a longer game though, clocking in at 60-90 and appears heavy upon reading the rulebook.  The mechanisms are quickly grokked and players are up and running after a play or two.  

The 8 bit veneer and Tecmo Bowl lineage is just icing on the cake to give this game as beautiful a presentation as the mechanisms.  

Football fan or not (I veer more towards not), you need to check this out.

Unexpectedly good!  While dice determine the outcome of events, one can mitigate the luck in the game through proper planning and knowing when you use bench cards to bend the odds in your favor.  Additionally, the flavor in this game is excellent and does not disappoint in bringing you fun, arcade-style football to yoru tabletop.  Definitely a must-buy for anyone who enjoyed Techmo Bowl or NFL Blitz, but shouldn't be overlooked by those that enjoy the tactics and strategy of American football.

RATING: 10
OK, I've only scratched the surface here, but I'm giving this game a 10 rating already. From my limited experience and what I've read, my instinct is that there's much more strategy depth to be plumbed here than is evident upon the first few plays. I absolutely love the dice mechanism as it provides the right amount of risk management to create the back and forth of a real football game.

In short, you apply modifiers to your actions and hope for a 10+ which gives you a successful action plus an activation with another of your players. A roll of 7-9 is a success but gives your opponent a half-move activation. And the dreaded less than 6 is not only a failure but a full activation for your opponent. 

By positioning your players and using your cards, you jockey for the best DRMs you can get. You use one player to generate an activation for another. Sometimes lower player skill numbers are better and sometimes higher. There are rules for adjusting your play on the fly that add other nuances to your decisions. I can't say enough how smart the design is. Sure, dice recreate the chaos of a football play, but there's a surprising amount of player agency; this IS a Thinking Man's football game.

There are five different modes you can play, starting at 7v7 with no skills to the ultimate goal of 8v8 with skills and field goals. The skills open the game up tremendously. IMO, use the 7v7 simply for learning and get to the skills asap. Having players who break the rules makes for much more interesting decisions and strategy. 

From what I've read from the designer (who is very active in the forums) to more experienced players, sweeps, inside runs, and sophisticated plays in general are all possible when you get to the next level of skill in the game. I'm very excited and committed to getting there.

We haven't had as much fun an excitement with a game that isn't Race! Formula 90. 

The mechanisms are tight, thematic, and make intuitive sense. For the most part.

The difficulty level, for lack of a better term, scales well. There are various ways to play 7v7 and 8v8, and there's even a crazy Inferno mode, for fans of NFL Blitz, NBA Jam, NHL Hitz, and similar video games.

The teams are thoughtfully constructed, the abilities make sense, the hand management is brilliant... there is an incredible amount of love put into this game by the designer.

Oh, speaking of the designer, he actively supports the game here on BGG, and frequently communicates with players.

The only real critique I have is the player aids are not very good. They could stand to be condensed heavily, and remade to better serve as a reference. Honestly, this applies to Race! Formula 90 as well. Unfortunately this game is newer, meaning fewer fan-made resources exist. We're considering making our own, actually.

I digress. Ball sports fans need this game, much like motorsports fans need Race! Formula 90. No other game captures the thrills, strategies, and tactics. Even if you aren't a sports fan -- like our one friend -- the mechanisms are appealing enough to at least give it a shot.

This is amazing.  It FEELS rules-dense at first, but isn't bad at all once you get going.  (And, like any good, robust wargame that FLOWS, the system doesn't break down at all if you forget the exact details of crits or miscalculate a modifier or something.)

Like many of my favorite games, this is chaotic, but not luck-dependent.  A better, more experienced player will win this an overwhelming majority of the time.  There's a real art to playcalling, and risk management, etc.  But two players with similar skill levels?  Magic.

A special call-out for the art and graphic design: it's some of the best I've ever seen in a board game.  Amazing, original, thematic, and just plain fun.

ANOTHER special call-out: I lost a counter when punching it out (LITERALLY the most important counter, since I live in Dallas - Hall of Famer Roy Cakeman!!) . . . and Brent had me a replacement in the mail within a couple days.  Not only is he receptive and helpful on the forums, but he's quick to save klutzy idiots like me, too.

I was just shown a prototype of this at Gen Con 2016, and it's hard to overstate how clever and well done it is. There is almost zero downtime for players as the action goes quickly back and forth, and it's amazing how well it represents real football without overly burdensome fiddliness. I'm very excited to back this on Kickstarter.

Nicely implemented miniatures-game-as-sport implementation, with a potent dose of good humor. Only played the basic game so far, but at least adding skills is a must asap to give the teams their full character. Inferno looks like a heckuva lot of fun also. You don't need a lot of football knowledge, but you at least need a mental framework for how football works. Beyond that, the rules *are* really pretty straightforward, as the designer himself suggests. The player aids are a miss for me; while they're probably genuinely not needed even halfway into a game, they aim to be comprehensive (two sheets, three columns each) but, unless I missed it, seem to omit the movement rules and an overall sequence of play and, regardless, are just overloaded and little different from referring to the rulebook--give me a good one-pager with key rules, and I'd be happy. Components--rubberized playmat, cards (many, many cards!), player chits, other chits, and time cubes, and "8-bit"-controller-style "bench racks--are very good, particularly for the price point, though one yearns for the DIY pixel-block players that would make the critically important jersey numbers really pop. The rulebook is, to use the game's term, a partial success: most everything's clear, if not always where you expect it (and arguably written "backwards," with the player actions explained before the setup and sequence of play), but there are a few minor issues. The rules seem to imply that "as part of a move action" actions are only available on "move" and not "move plus x" actions, but the designer has ruled the reverse. Half-activations are just moves, not skill-check-action eligible, but that's maybe not as clear as it could be. "Critical success/failure" isn't defined in a way that stands out. Still and all, an admirable effort, and I expect to play a fair bit.

Techno Bowl captures the flow and feel of football excellently. This game is seriously a flat out blast to play. The freedom to design formations and plays, as well as improvise during a play mean that you as a player feel in control of the action and no two games will be the same. Such a great game, especially as a football fan.

Techno Bowl is 7-on-7 American football as a board game. It's got an arcade-style pace (no new first downs, just four downs to score) but is otherwise very recognizably football. Contrasted with Blood Bowl-style fantasy football games, this is not a rugby derivative. Coaches (the human players, as distinct from the playing-piece football players) can set up formations and plays based on actual football and reasonably expect them to execute like actual football. It's a really good distillation.

Complexity for the base game is quite low: a player's stats are tied to the lead digit of his jersey (3 through 7). That number is a player's speed and passing range, and the difference in numbers modifies blocking and tackling (where lower numbers are better, representing the big uglies in the trenches). Actions are resolved via 2d6 roll. Standard "successful" actions give the opponent a half-move to respond to the play mid-stream, while failures or strong success results award bonus full activations to one team or the other to break a play open.

Additional game modes add superstar abilities to impact players (a QB who can run the read-option when a defender approaches, a sure-handed CB who'll haul in any off-target pass in his area for the INT) and Inferno Mode where players catch fire for additional bonuses as they make spectacular plays.

Game of the year for me in 2017!  Spirit Island and Gloomhaven coming in a distant 2nd and 3rd.

Seriously, this really captures the feeling of playing football.  I went into Techno Bowl expecting it to be a distillation of football, just like Baseball Highlights: 2045 is for the game of baseball.  BH:2045 is a great game so I had high hopes.  This completely exceeded my expectations.  You're in complete control of the whole team.  Each play is fully formed from decisions you make - where each player is placed, order they are activated, and the actions they are going to take on the field.  The only place you lose some of that control is when you roll for success/failure, but even then by smart positioning and boosting your modifiers, you can start to tip the rolls in your favor.  Those dice rolls are what add the excitement to each play and make your decisions extra difficult.  You have to constantly weigh what your opponent might do if you fail the roll.  Is it worth the risk? 

Minor complaint - the rule book makes this seem way more difficult to learn than it really is.  Highly recommend watching a video of game play first and then read the rule book.  Much easier to learn that way.  I'll even admit to watching more than 1 game play video and I NEVER do that.  Not because I wasn't understanding it, but because it was fun to watch the match up. Even more fun when you're the one making the decisions!

You can easily tell how good a player is at something based on the first # on their jersey.  This represents their skill level.  Higher #s are faster and low #s are better at tackling.

Brief summary of how to play:
1. Offense sets up their play by arranging the players on the field.
2. Defense sets up their play by arranging the players on the field.
3. The offense and defense simultaneously pick 5 cards and place them face down in a stack.  
--Each card represents one player on the team.  By putting them in the stack, you are saying you want to activate them during the play.
4. Offense is then allowed to "motion".  Then, defense is allowed to "motion."  Repeat for a 2nd chance to motion. 
--"Motion" just means moving a player into a new position.
5. First card in each stack is flipped face up.
6. Defense is allowed to "read and react." If defense "reads and reacts", offense is allowed to do the same.  
--"Read and react" means you no longer want to activate the card you flipped face up, but instead want to activate a different card that isn't currently part of the stack.
7. Higher card chooses which person activates first.  If a tie, then roll a die.  Still a tie, then the offense decides.
8. Each card takes an action - whether it is full movement, tackle, block, or pass, or half movement + tackle, block, or pass.  
9. After both sides have activated their card, repeat steps 5-8 for all 5 cards.
10. If the play is still going after all 5 cards are activated, then you continue to do steps 5-8, but you pull from your unplayed cards 1 by 1.
12.  If you play through all of your cards, then start over at step 3 until the play is over.
--Play ends with a touchdown, a tackle of the ball carrier, the ball carrier going out of bounds, or incomplete pass (advanced rule option).
13.  You have 4 plays/downs to score.  Otherwise, the other team gets the ball.

When you perform a skill check (tackle, block, pass, etc) to see if an action is successful, you roll 2D6.  You will be able to modify these rolls up to +3/-3 (see rules for details, but very straightforward).
1-6: action was unsuccessful so the opposing team gets to fully activate one player
7-9: action was successful, but the opposing team gets to move one player up to half their movement value
10+: action was a complete success so you get to fully activate one other player

It's amazing to watch plays unfold in front of you. Lots of fun decisions to make each turn.  You'll make moves that give yourself the upperhand on the field by playing to your players strengths.  You'll position your players for favorable match ups against the opposing team.  Very tactical.  Once you get the game play flow down, it's nonstop action, too.  

Lots to explore in the game.  You can start out with 7-on-7 and no skills.  This makes it easy to focus on the gameplay and learn how to play.  It's also easier to score with more room to maneuver on the field.  You can work your way up to 8-on-8 and add in skills.  This gives you more to consider each play.  It also helps differentiate each team since they'll have players with different skills.  There's also an Inferno mode that should make it feels a little more action-y and over the top, but I haven't had a chance to try that out yet.

I pretty much knew I was going to love it after I watched a video to learn how to play.  So clever!  It's all I want to play right now.  Can't stop thinking about how to play better or what to try next time.  Easily one of my favorite games!  Dropped Blood Bowl and Guild Ball off my wishlist after I played this.  It hits all the right notes for me and I don't see either of those games topping it.

This game feels like real North American (CFL/NFL) football.  Line up in your formation, call the play and run the play.  It can be a pass play or run play.  You can move guys in motion.  Send guys on a blitz or drop back into coverage.  As a fan of football I love it.  My friend who isn't into sports also loves it.

Excellent implementation of a football game.  I've played a lot of football sims, and this one is the best of its type, better than [gameid=15985].  Very little simulation to this, but nonetheless quite interesting as a game.  Doesn't make the mistake of having too many plays simulated, just a few and the game is over.  Design and components are great.  The theme may be a turnoff for people who aren't football fans, but the mechanics are interesting enough that it is an interesting game regardless.  It's particularly nice that very little of this is about outguessing your opponent, as is the case with most football sims.  Instead, the focus is on the execution of the players, and the game is better for it.  And of course, the fact that this is based on my favorite video game of all time is really the icing on the cake.  This is fantastic, and for any football fan, there's a ton to enjoy here.

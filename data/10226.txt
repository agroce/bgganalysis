Best civil war game of the ones i owned. The written orders were a nice feature and adds some nice realism.

A great Gettysburg game with innovative command rules and just a fun game to play.  Plays well solitaire too.  A bit heavy in terms of rules, which is the only thing that stops it being a perfect wargame.

Good grief. This is an interesting system, but it takes far, far, far too long for any enjoyment you get out of it. I once played this for three Saturdays running, 7-8 hours each, and we didn't even make it through the first day. While not unsympathetic to what they're trying to do, the playing time for this game is absolutely insane, given how much really happens. You get *way* too bogged down in details.

RATING: 8
The CWB series does an excellent job of portraying ACW combat at this level, but this isn't a light game.  There's a fair amount of bookkeeping and the rules have subtleties that need to be learned through practice.  A great system that I'd love to have the time to get on the table more often.  The first day scenario is a 10.

Great system. Good solo. Hard to get competitive while playing this one - it's like watching history unfold. I've found myself fascinated by the casualty track. It's easy to see how deadly some of the pockets of fighting could get.

The orders system found in the BCS bring this conflict to life in a way not found in previous games.  However, you get out of the orders system what you put into it - it is not a free ride.

Part of the CWB series that I'm a huge fan of.  Covers this iconic battle and can be played in a reasonable amount of time.  We did find that we needed to tweak the Initial orders for the Confederates a bit to better reflect their limited knowledge of the actual terrain, otherwise you see the Rebels going full bore for Cemetery Hill well before that historically were even aware of it.  Another excellent game that is highly recommended.

Have this and most of the CW Brigade Series. These games are a great alterative to the GBACW games as they are easier and quicker to set up and play. I especially like the writing orders style of play as it adds a touch of reality to the game. I also have the games in the sister series featuring the Napoleonic battles.

I've heard great things about this game for many years, so when I finally nabbed a copy at a reasonable price I got it on the table as quick as I could. It did not disappoint. Love the combat system, the level of detail, the orders system, the graphics....ehhhhhh....but they are very functional. After the disappointing 3DoG and it's massive rules overhead and mountains of counters...this was just the Gettysburg game I needed. The Gamers=a great game company.

Lots of good stuff, but still a monster game. Also artillery is so powerful that the defender has to set on the reverse slopes (like Wellington) to survive. I saw Pickett's charge succede once when the Union line on the foward slopes was decimated by the Rebel guns

RATING: 6
Gettysburg at the Brigade level.  The written orders system captures the chaos and difficulty of getting multiple Corps to attack at the same time.  Combat resolution and movement mechanics are appropriate to the scale and allow historical flavor without too much complexity.  However, the repetive die rolling (6 to 8 dice for each fire combat) and combat results tables look ups take so long that great orders system tends to get overwhelmed by the monotony of the chart lookup.

CWB and Gettysburg situation are a terrific combination.  My favorite Gettysburg game by a mile.

RATING: N/A
Want it because it is about Gettysburg, not because of the system itself.  The second edition is worth looking for as some say.  I still have doubt about myself whether I could get indulged in this game and this system, and whether "written orders" in a competitive gaming actually work or not.  The one in the series that I would have wanted from the sea of games in the series. One of the tactical level map nicest I have ever seen.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best Civil War System with its brilliant command rules, and in the 2nd edition the best Gettysburg game I've played, by a long shot.
Minor drawbacks: Slow to play, and the meeting engagement nature means that skewed command dierolls on the first day will likely decide the battle.

(Review refers to second edition).

To my mind, the best Gettysburg wargame.  The orders system, although frequently frustrating ("their flank's wide open - attack d*mn you!") perfectly captures the stops and starts of the historical battle.

I have played this any number of times.  Have played with the variants (including all the Confederate additions) and have seen the gray tide roll over Cemetery and Culp's Hills.  The Civil War Brigade Series works incredibly well in creating the fog of war that the commanders had to deal with.

This is a blast to play and I have found it to be a very reasonable presentation of the options.  A first day assault on Culp's and Cemetery is not a guarantee.  Early and Ewell were not clearly nuts.  At times one hopes for a bigger map (a la Summer Storm) in order to try out different manouvers which is a hallmark of hte CWB system.

RATING: 9
If you love the CWB system, with all of its orders writing, bookkeeping, straggler recovery, etc, this is the best of the lot, although it could use an updating, which is why I rated it 9 instead of 10.  Rules are a bit long in the tooth, too, and could use a facelift.  Still, much more managable than any of the regimental games on the subject such as TSS, 3Dog, or even THG, and more realistic than any smaller G-burg.  Campaign, from start to finish, can be done in about 20 hours between 2 players who know what they are doing.  Great set of variable entry rules for gamers who want to mix things up a little.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Extremely long game. Once the lines settle down things get a bit repetitive, mechanically. Rules are pretty straight forward, the orders system being the big draw. Definitely use the 3.2 rules rather than the incomplete 1st ed. rules.

On the strength of this game, I'd play more of the CWB series but I don't think I have the appetite for another 60 hour battle. It's not interesting enough for that length of time

A solid treatment of the battle in the CWB series format.

IMHO the CWB series truly shines when the player is "confronted" with historical leaders like McClellan, Pope, Bragg, Buell, McClernand, etc.  Not quite the case here...

The large number of optional units is cool.  TATC might not the best showcase of the command system, since most units enter with historical orders. The game could benefit from a "McLellan points" mechanism to keep a tight leash on Heth & Pender on day 1 of the battle.  This is true of most Gettysburg games, though. See Champion Hill for CWBS comments.

The best game in one of my favorite series. Plenty of troops and maneuver space for both sides...if and when they can get orders to take advantage of them. If you're tired of Gettysburg games where every regiment or brigade instantly responds like a radio-controlled toy...if you're tired of games that use random chit pulls that don't really do anything more than interrupt and restructure what is an artificial sequence of play to begin with...then you're ready for CWB's orders system.

Want to maneuver? Want to launch an attack? Write an order. Wait for it to be accepted. Cringe when it's sometimes misunderstood. Fume when it's delayed or ignored. Revel when it's accepted and the attack hits home, crippling or routing a portion of the enemy's line...but remember that these are huge armies that won't be swept away by a single attack. Write some more orders to take advantage of your successes or spread the attack farther down the line. Plan ahead...keep the initiative...without having to rely on lucky card draws or chit pulls. This is what the old Avalon Hill blurbs only dreamed of when they trumpeted "now YOU are in command."

A great (the greatest?) showing for the CWBS games. 
Two armies at the prime of their training (if not command structure), fighting an epic battle. The orders system really gets a good workout and really captures the "odd orders" and "false starts" that happened historically.

RATING: 8.5
Thunder at the Crossroads is among the best of the Gettysburg titles. The order system relies on player interpretation, which may pose a problem sometimes. One of the problems caused is that orders may be used in not very historical ways, such as interposing small forces to provide obstacles for reinforcements. Artillery seems way overrated, especially as an offensive weapon. Apart from this the game is surprisingly streamlined, even if the dice rolling is extensive. After playing the first day the results are very close to what actually happened.

Update: When playing with gamers using the properties of the order system to actually win the game, I actually found that game session to be probably the worst (in terms of history) simulation of Gburg I have ever played!

RATING: 4
So far I'm actually liking this but I've only played it with five which isn't great, hence the rating of six. I think with fewer players it would force more interesting decisions and maybe make the hand management (which feels kind of vestigial) shine a bit.

I use the variant where the profit cards are guaranteed to be deep in the deck but that doesn't seem like enough for five player, let alone six. I was thinking about doing the first run through the deck with no profit cards and then shuffle one in to the bottom of subsequent decks, just to give everyone a chance to build a conglomerate before profit comes up.

update: lowered to a four because I can't really imagine getting it back on the table. The set collection of the money cards is so weak that it undercuts the cleverness of the set building with the property cards. If there were a way to make this into an auction game it would be great. By modern standards this feels like half of a game, something of a running theme with many of Sackson's designs. Looking at other games of its era I would have to rate it very highly against them but it falls short today. I still enjoy owning it because the vintage copy is just lovely.

RATING: 3
Horrible, horrible game.  The only decision is whether to buy as much as you can whenever you have the money or save up to buy another card later.  The money is far too random - if I draw a 1, another 1, and a 3 of different sets when the guy across from me is drawing a 12, a 16, and a 20, what chance do I have?  

Even if I do manage to hold on to my crappy money cards of the same set long enough to collect a set of three, that only adds up to $32, when the guy across from me already has $48 from those same three cards.  That's just not enough to compensate for drawing bad cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interesting stuff from Sid Sackson that still holds up when playing with three. With four, you not only get fewer turns to do stuff (and you need them, since some of your turns will just be hand-builders), but there are fewer company cards available for you to stack and then re-order later, which, let&#039;s face it, is most of the fun here.

Got a complete 1970 copy in good shape from e-bay after reading this as a recommendation from a BGGer.  This is a good Sackson game, though missing the nicer appearance of today's games; and, I can see the potential for some serious analysis paralysis.

What a cool little card game.  When I picked this up in trade, it sounded interesting.  When I played it, it met my expectations.  As the game moves along, you have the chance to make more money (score points), but it gets harder to 're-org' your companies while purchacing new companies.  The rules were more complicated than the game.  Once the game got going, it was fairly easy-breezy.  It was fun with two!  Glad I got to play this old gem.  But then, I'm a sucker for a good card game.

Update 1/2010:  Have played numerous times with a varied amount of people.  Plays well with 5 or 6 but probably best with 3 or 4.  Still a 7 in my book.

Looking for 3M butterbox version.

This is a total blast from the past, and a pretty fun little game.   Although it's overshadowed by newer games, it was good for a single play.   The problem of random money cards (a staple of those years) makes this a very random affair however.     Rating a 7.

A very intense brain burner.  This game does not seem very luck dependant for a cardgame.  If it seems so just make a house variant for the proxy cards.

No bells and whistles, just a fascinating set of strategic and tactical problems.  So much to think about on every play!  Including: the cards available for purchase; what you need at the moment; the capital combinations in your hand; adding to your collection now vs waiting for a better combination; the value of reorganization; whether you're tempting a theft; when you should use a proxy.  Few games offer so much to think about within simple rules.

We play this 2-player which takes about 40 minutes.  There are lots of options, so we wouldn't want to play with someone who must constantly calculate all the possibilities!  You should also avoid this if having to do frequent (basic) arithmetic during a game bothers you.  Otherwise, this is a really nice game with multiple ways to score, despite the compact ruleset.  We can see alot of elements in this game that have been incorporated into much later successful games.

Highly tense and competitive game, quasi-abstract but with thematic tropes. One can see a little of the brilliance of Acquire in Venture, but it's a much lighter and quite luck-prone game. It's mostly about not letting your opponents get too far ahead, while prepping up a huge hammer to allow you to win the game at the end. Simple and streamlined, and quite interesting with 4+ gamers. Don't mind the take that element, since it follows the theme.  Quite enjoyable.

I think I need to play this again to fully evaluate it, but the overall game struck me as a little bland. It's all about making melds with as many like letters as possible, but it played a tad long for what it was and seemed sort of processional. The currency randomness also seems as though it makes the game swingy.

Not a bad game, but not really remarkable either.

I absolutely love this game. Although it is American in origin it plays and scores very much like a German game. Since it predates the German game craze I can not help but feel that it was a leader in this type of game. I had a 3M version but about a year ago I lent it out never to see it again. I was lucky enough to find a German version, Wirtschafts Wunder, recently and the world is much brighter. I think this game ranks up there with Acquire as Sid Sackson's finest.

Sid Sackson's card drafting game from an era before we knew what card drafting was. A little too long though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Clever and classic Sid Sackson game, lesser known but up there with his best, with some of its mechanics later appearing in modern euro games.  Abstract financial theme, simple rules with complex decisions that can be brainburning at times.  Interaction comes in the form of proxy fights, which can be vicious.

Venture is truly a classic Sid Sackson title. It's not for those who require a convincing theme, or who are particularly AP prone. But it will appeal especially to those who enjoy brainburning and complex choices, and who thrive on the challenge of being engaged with difficult and deep decisions within the context of a relatively simple ruleset, and don't mind some degree of luck through card draw, as well as moments of real interaction. It's a very clever, tight and constrained design ... The publisher Gryphon Games has done us a real service by bringing this title back into print in a handsome new edition.

This is a nice card game and has a definite Sackson feel to it. Essentially, you are collecting cards and making sets in order to score the highest points. You have to buy stocks with resource cards from a draw pile. There are occasional moments of screwage on your opponents as well. A brain burner at times for sure, but engaging from beginning to end. Nothing revolutionary, but considering its age and who designed it, I think it's a solid entry in the card game genre.  I will complain given all the games that have come after it, Venture is very dry and feels more light straight mathematics with a little push-your-luck and take that! on the side.

1983 AH & 1970 3M. Both missing a couple cards, but can construct a full set by combining. Hints of Alhambra, but so much better. Lots of potential for screwage, so maybe that's why.

RATING: 6
A set collecting card game that holds up surprisingly well for its age. 

Players try to collect combinations of cards (corporations) in sets that increase in value based on size and commonality. These cards are bought from a central display or stolen from opponents with money cards, which can also be played in sets for increased value.

The turns can go quickly as long as players use the downtime to examine each other's cards instead of waiting until their turn. There is some "take that" play, but it's limited to drawing the necessary cards.

Overall, I liked it quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game has some great qualities to it. There are many choices to make on each turn. Whether you want to buy multiple lower cost and less versatile corporations or save your money in hopes that you can land one of the more expensive and more versatile corporations on your next turn. As the game plays out you also have the choice of stealing other peoples corporations with the proxy fight cards, which adds a nice interaction element to the game. Reorganizing your conglomerates can also help you hold on to your more expensive corporations. The one down fall is that there is a lot of math involved on each turn, and with each strategy. This makes it hard to play many times in a row without your brain hurting. I like this game quite a lot, but wife is not a fan. She would much rather play Dominion.

RATING: 6
Two decks of cards: one for funds, another for corporations that you stack into conglomerates based on the letters they have on top. Of course, the money deck includes the opportunity to steal corporations as a balance mechanism and only conglomerates of a certain size earn profit (or points) whenever the trigger cards come up. This is a game of building up power while trying to keep your opponents down… but it never seems to reach the intensity that draws you into repeated games.

PLUS: not hard to learn, theme
MINUS: lack of intensity, no end goal to victory (unless you count getting through the company deck)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The best economic card game I've ever played! (The only economic card game I've ever played?)

In this game you purchase cards (corporations) from the table in order to build sets (conglomerates) with unlike suits but matching values. You score points whenever a scoring card pops up (there are two in the deck, but the deck gets reshuffled a few times in a game). You can also use proxy cards to purchase cards out of other player's tableauxs or pay to reorganize your cards in order to protect your most valuable corporations, as only those on the top of a set can be stolen. There's quite a bit to think about here, but as in all card games your options are limited by what's in hand, so the game stays fairly light. Very enjoyable for an economic game fix that plays in under an hour.

You have to admire this game for how it was head of its time.  It's still definitely playable today, though not as convincing as Acquire.  It seems like there's probably a little too much luck in the money card draw, and a potential for serious AP problems in the reconfiguration of the conglomerate cards.  I think that with a few tweaks the game could still be really playable.  As it is, I don't think that I see myself pulling it out all that often.

This game works well, and is a snap to teach.  It is sort of mean, as you can target other players with the proxy cards.  But this allows for the players to level off the luck of the cards.  Good hour game.

OK set-collection card game. Element of luck is a bit too high: profit cards appear at random which causes a first player advantage during scoring. The proxy cards can be nasty, but require to reorganise your own collection (as defense against a proxy card) and keep an eye on the other players (as offense to take away a card of the person in the lead).

Hmmm...my game smells its age...:-)  Primarily this appears to be a set collection game where you are seeking to align as many diverse sets of 6 as possible that involve as many of the same letter as possible which allows for a considerable bonus.  Cards in the money deck also allow for you to raid a stock from an opponent at the top of their stack.  When purchasing stock, you often look to purchase a cheap stock to protect your investment for later scoring when you can hopefully re-organize before scoring to maximize points.

Clever little set collecting card game.  Dry as toast and completely abstract but the proxy cards give it some player interaction and the decisions of which cards to draft, how to arrange your conglomerates etc. can be meaty.

Sid Sackson game with two decks with money and businesses.  Lower value money cards can form sets that are worth more.  You can buy businesses from a tableau or have a proxy fight to steal another players business.  You form conglomerates that when scoring cards come out give you points.  The business haves letters on them that must match and the more letter that match with more businesses in the conglomerate the more points you get.  

I like the game, but it does show its age.  The letters are a little unthematic, but if you can get this one cheap it is worth a play.  


Fairly light and probably family friendly in terms of weight.

Fun game that might be just a little too long for what it is.  One could shorten that by removing some of the corporation cards though.

It's got one 'take that' mechanic where you can take other people's cards.  That might be a deal breaker for some.

If it is, just remove those cards.

I don't own any other game like this.

Another of 3M's beloved finance plots (here it's all about speculation) fortunately doesn't get on the way of this complex but very accessible card game. As often happens with Sid Sackson's creations, rich play is squeezed out of a handful of rules - some of the delicacies here are the way weak cards can be joined to become more powerful than strong cards, the way restrictions at combining bought industries lead the player to surprising choices, the tactical use of reorganization against opponents trying to pinch industries off you, and the way evaluations can appear at every turn. All immaculately balanced, hence the better player wins regardless of the odd card draw. 

Venture guarantees fun and tense play every time - even though it's not a game to play twice in a row, after one round I'm always looking forward to the next one. A deserved classic, and arguably one of the summits of Sid Sackson's already impressive output.

Not a good set collecting game. The early leader runs away (there’s so many scorings) and if they can protect their sets by putting ordinary cards on top, there’s little personal gain in hitting the leader, so play for position, and pray for an early end.

This is a card game about building a giant company, that pays you dividends whenever a "profit" card came to the top of the deck (a little like the Alhambra scoring).  The game involved some clever set collection via both color and letter matching in the company cards, and shapes in the money cards.  I did enjoy building up my assets, and knowing when I had to scoop something up before other people would.  The one area where this game fell flat for me was in the "proxy" cards--these cards let you steal other people's already played company cards, with no reimbursement to that player (you had to pay the bank instead).  It created a situation of an undirected take-that, where you might blast people who aren't in the lead just because they have the card you need.  I thought at the very least, the payment for the proxy should go to the targeted player.

A rare Sackson disappointment for me. The basic set-collection structure works fine, if not exactly evocative of building a business empire. And the balancing of the low and high-value money cards by allowing low cards to be built up into more valuable sets is classic Sackson elegance (later used by Knizia too). But the random, swingy take-that cards seemed oddly out of place in a Sackson design and the game really dragged for us. I won't write it off yet, but it was not a good first impression.

August 2017: Still, some flaws: The game is *slow* moving, perhaps because of all the arithmetic involved as well as the set collection part of the game really does feel like a Sudoku puzzle -- both of which make the game feel very, very dry.

Jan 2007: What Alhambra wants to be.

Die Bosse: I usually dislike card drafting games. What makes this better than the rest, and why a game like this will never appear today in the Euro market:

a) The screw-the-leader proxy cards. This adds a refreshing element of nastiness usually non-existent in Euro games, and serves as a balancing mechanisms for the large point gains one can make during the game. (Those large point swings are somewhat atypical in Euros as well.)

b) There's usually something good to draft from; no need for players to draw from the face-down stock because everything's crap.

I found it not as heavy and brain-burning as other commenters here have stated.

Well it's from the great Sid so I'm loathe to say anything bad about it.

The takeover rule seemed bizarre to me - surely the cash should go to the player who lost the company rather than to the bank but the rules do say otherwise.

AH gamette in shrink. Well, I just unshrinked it. Strange to think that this game has finally been opened after 22 years...

The genius that is Sid Sackson is all over this game. It has many mechanics and hallmarks of 'euro' games that we have come to love. Designers like Alan Moon and Dirk Henn have obviously 'used' Sackson mechanics in their games...

The game does bog down with AP (lots of possible combinations). Some variants should make it a shorter game.

Nice abstract card drafting/set collection game. 
Normally plays very fast and easy but last turns can take very long in order to form the optimal card sets.

Works well with non-gamers too.

Venture still remains a great classic up there with Acquire despite its age. I like only a few games with only cards (Jambo is a current one I like), but this one has enough to it to be worthwhile. It would be good for either family fun or with other gamers. It's really a kind of Rummy on business/finance steroids, but still strangely plays like a fresh interesting game.

RATING: 7
Build up a the perfect weapons developing corporation.  Halfway through my first game I realized what kind of company we were making.

With three this is a tight little math game.  The money works beautifully and the development of your corporations become more provokingly constrained as you progress.  It is possible to plan for card combos that won't come up as some matched letters are more infrequent than others.  You need to actively attack the leader otherwise they may end up running away with the game.

We tried playing this with 6 and found that it was just way too chaotic. It is entirely possible that the 5 other players could take 5 (or more) companies from you by the time your turn comes around.  

I see a decent game here, but not for 6.  I'll only play this with three.  

This would get a higher rating, if the end game didn't bog down a bit with A/P.

1 play, 3er

An oldie! A business-themed set collection card game. There are some very clever (especially for its time) ideas here: for example, card drafting from a central pool, balancing low-value money cards by making sets more valuable, the randomly timed payoffs (like Union Pacific). But the things that killed the game for me (us):
- the totally random money card draws, despite the set-collection thing, is annoying
- the proxy cards, which allow you to steal cards from other players (with no compensation to them, and very little defense): VERY annoying! 
- the game play was too long ... the end painfully dragged on well beyond the point when it should have ended

Strictly speaking, the game should probably rate higher than a 3. For me, though, it fits: I'll not play this again unless someone else really really wants to; and in that case, it's really just to confirm whether my rating should be a 2 or a 4!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A well-designed, fun game that doesn&#039;t take too long to learn.  Would rate it higher except it often can easily lead to the dreaded analysis paralysis, especially towards the end of the game.  Maybe next time I should try it with a timer.

Interesting Sackson game about building weapons manufacturing conglomerations from smaller corporations and then grafting off of military contracts. For the amount of luck in the game coming from the two card decks, it feels really well balanced. That Sid Sackson really knows his math. Speaking of which, the math seems especially designed to frustrate the heck out of you, which itself is fun. The proxy fights can be vicious, especially as you watch the one company you need for so many reasons get reorganized to the bottom of a huge heap.

There is only one winner, but the rest of the players are still multimillionaires, so that's pretty good.

RATING: 6.5
Old Sid Sackson set collection card game, where you buy cards and try and arrange them into sets. The trick is that the cheaper the card, the less flexible it is. The cheapest card has a single letter on it, A, B, C etc, and can only be grouped with other cards that share the same letter. The most expensive cards have 5 letters, allowing them to be grouped with almost anything. It's also possible (but expensive) to completely re-arrange your cards, should later acquisitions make better groupings available, or you wish to hide a card at the bottom of a pile from an opponent. Because...

There's some real "take that" as many of the cards in the money deck allow you to simply purchase a card from an opponent's stacks, and put it on yours. And they receive nothing for this, as you put the money in the discard pile, rather than give it to the person you stole from! The first time it happens to you, it's "WHAT?!" :angry:

Venture has many of the typical "Sacksonisms", as money and scoring climb when grouped. For example, a set of 3 cards with the same letter is 1 point, 4 cards is 3 points, 5 cards 8 points, and 6 cards 20 points. Similarly, the money also groups, if you can get the right cards. A 1 and 3 combine to be 16 instead of 4, if they have the same symbol. Add a 5, and they combine to 32 instead of 9. This leads to tense decisions as you have to worry about spending the cash you have, vs drawing the right cards that could make the money you have worth a lot more than it is now.

An old card game of company building. Build your company by colors and letters. Larger companies make more. Play cards to enhance your companies or punish your opponents companies. I liked it enough to give it an 8. Would have to play again to see if that rating will still hold.

I remember playing this back in high school.  Certainly a Sid Sackson classic.

Like the artwork on the cards - of it's time. A set collecting game with a difference. Seem to be led by the cards but I suspect more plays will show there is more to think about.

Played once and got crushed.  I kept getting $3 and $5 million cards and 1-1/2x proxies, and my friend kept getting $14 and $16 million cards and 1/2x proxies.  I think it's a good game, but there is a bit too much luck involved for me.  Maybe I'm missing something though.

(30) a sid sackson classic... simple card game where you spend resources (cards) to create conglomerates of corporations (set collection of cards) and collect profits (points).... person with most profit wins the game... my gaming group really liked the ease of play of this game

RATING: N/A
Finance stock-based card game to launch start up companies with sets of money cards where value scales exponentially. These companies can be targets of proxy take overs or can grow into conglomerates sharing letter attributes. Amusing that they have a reorganization action.

Dry dry dry.  It's not a very exciting game.  Not to say it's not good...but I'm not sure this is something I want to play over and over.  Brain-burning, to be sure.  And the payout cards are awfully random.  Withholding final judgment for now.

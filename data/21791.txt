An interesting puzzle type game.  There is a lot of figuring out how to maximize your points based on what cards you have, but if you wait too long you may miss your chance.  I'd like to play it with more players, as I think it will change from a strategic game to a tactical game very quickly.

Odd game where you try to set up the board to match potential scoring opportunities from your cards in hand. Tactical and luck-heavy as cards cycle through your hand on a regular basis throughout the game.  Still, it plays rather quickly and feels quite novel.

At first Masons looks like any other abstract strategy game with rather simple rules and lot of tactical decisions. But there are two big design flaws, at least in my book. First, you cannot do anything meaningful with a bad roll but increase the victory point potential for other players. Secondly, the scoring cards are terribly unbalanced with the VP potential ranging from a couple of points to 20 or more. There is not much you can do against an opponent with a better hand even if you played a perfect game maxing out your own cards. This reduces number of meaningful decisions and brings the game down to the level of more or less meaningless past time activity. 

But I have seen worse games and fortunately the game plays fast. At best players have an equal chance for victory and such games could be tight and entertaining.

RATING: 7
A good game if you realize going in that a)it is not a brain burner, and 2)there is a fair amount of luck - deal with it.  It's one of those games that to me is relaxing and just enjoyable.  Games that combine a good deal of luck are ok with me, as long as there is some strategy to help counteract it.  This game has that.

RATING: 6
An okay game.  The scoring cards, which are drawn at random, make or break you.  Kind of annoying like that.  Still, a decent enough almost area control game.

Quick play, fun - my sister and her bf seemed to enjoy it! But the global tower point scoring cards are OP!

I wasn't too impressed with the overall appearance of both board and bits, and as for the Mediaeval theme? Well, let's just say that (by comparison) Carcassonne is a scholarly dissertation on the Middle Ages. I can easily imagine Masons re-themed as "Trench War", a World War One game with the walls as trenches, towers as machine guns, houses and palaces as infantry units, etc.
Having said all that negative stuff, Masons is a LOT of fun! Huge amounts of luck involved, but fun nevertheless. At best, this is definitely a tactical game, and not strategic. Simple rules, too.

RATING: 5
{3 plays, 4 players} I wanted to like it... it looks kinda cool, and has a nice idea - everyone's placing pieces in such a way as to create stuff that matches the scoring cards in their hand.  All players score when scoring is triggered, and your hand is very fluid, so the "patterns" you want to create are constantly shifting.  But... minor quibble: you roll dice to determine what pieces you can play. They are slightly forgiving, but even still, a bad roll or two not only hurts you, but potentially helps others, especially since... major quibble: the scoring cards have a really wide range.  In every game I've played now, the players who were in it each got several cards that were worth 14-16 points, while the others were lucky to score 6-7 per, and often threw away cards that only scored 1-3 (you can ditch 1 card and draw 2 new ones instead of scoring... but of course, you don't score then, right?)  At first, I just thought I was placing badly, having not "seen" the game yet.  But even after "getting" the game, I still saw this happen.  Oddly, it felt very random and capricious, which is *not* what I think of Colovini's games being.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While I enjoy the idea and the theme the game keeps coming out with a decided "Meh" with whatever group I play it with.  I come out on top consistently so I have to agree, meh!

It doesn't help that a few walls broke from simple transport of the game.  Makes me saaaaaaaaaaad.

RATING: 6
experiences on this one can vary greatly based on player styles.  i can see how quickly it plays, i like the dice system, and it's relatively easy to explain.  the tower scoring cards seem exceptionally powerful, though, and it seems that proper play might be closing off cities as quickly as possible without scoring them so that you can replace your cards - at least until hot-scoring ones are drawn.  i'll look for an online implementation to test that out some more, but it looks to me like it might be tower draws trying to score vs non-tower draws trying to reduce their points.  and supposing it doesn't come down to that, could it still just be scoring draws vs people trying to cycle for scoring draws?  still not without its merits, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Typical abstract Colovini style design.  This one is a bit more random in that the cards drawn initially are hard to cycle, so a great draw can lead to a big lead.  This can be a hard game to feel like you have much control.  If you do not like a little chaos in your games, try this one before adding it to your collection.  Not Colovini's strongest, but a respectable game nonetheless.  [GTI: AGCL]

I rate the game as intended a 7 
Luck plays a bit too large a role, but I like the way you're cooperatively building while at the same time jockeying for position on hidden goals. The artwork of this is somewhat cringe-inducing, but the wooden components are good, and the full board at the end of the game looks awesome. 

Unfortunately after having played a couple of times, it turns out that a few of the goals are seriously overpowered, and the winning strategy is to cycle through the deck looking for them. If other players aren't aware of this, that effectively 'breaks' the game. Either way, being "forced" to play for these cards ruins a lot of the enjoyment in the game.

RATING: 3
While the game may by inexpensive and have great components... the game itself is lacking. I have nothing against luck in a game, as long as you feel like your decisions influence the game; but in this game, you will feel like you are simply going through the motions without much control over your fate. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very interesting game. I still don't seem to get the hold of it, though. Rating may vary as soon as I learn it better.

UPDATE: It's an interesting idea. The randomness of the game comes not only from what you can place in the board, but from your scoring. Other games have bonus scoring cards, but here, cards are all that can give you points.

And therein lies the problem of the game. You are more at the mercy of "luck of the draw" here than in any other game I've ever seen. The fact that you can't decide what colors to place only makes matters worse. Maybe if at least you could first roll and then decide where to play, it would mitigate a bit the luck factor. But as it is, the game is way too luck dependent for me. Down to a 5.

Is it just me but as I'm getting more and more into the game, there are more options, cities are developing then GAME END! What? Already? But I wanted to make this a really big city etc... 
Oh well better than 'When will this ever end' scenario and I got the wife to play twice in one night.
My wife likes this too (the board is very pretty). Scales well and don't believe all the non sense about the luck factor. This is easily managable. Probably go higher after more play.

Indeed - this game is good. The most indepth strategy game I own that plays between 30 and 45 minutes.

Got this game because it was on sale on Amazon for $10. I had never heard of it before. Turned out to be a great purchase! My wife and mom like this game a lot. All of our games are very close (which for some people could be a bad thing I guess. Sometimes, it seems like someone can get a lucky card at the end that can make the difference in the game. But for us, it's great). Turns go quickly which is something we like in our games. A good, lightweight game that takes under an hour to play.

Nice components too!

Fun, fast moving building game.  Game also moves on the principle of tearing down existing walls to keep the game going since it ends when the pieces run out.  Good decision making game.  I may move this up with a few more plays.  UPDATE: After more plays, this game is very good.  Approachable for young players, but strategic enough for hardcore gamers.  Random enough for some light drama.

First off, this is THEE solo game, if there ever was a solo game.  It's got just enough in your control, and out of your control, to really do some damage.

I liked this game, but if my wife asked me, "honey, what game do you want to play", I think this would be 15th on my long long list of games to play.  It just doesn't really emotionally connect with me.

...and that's what I have to say about it.  It's a good game, I just don't know if it's THE game.

RATING: 7.9
You're faced with a lot of tough decisions throughout the game. Perhaps most importantly when do I use my precious scoring cards. Use them to early and you will not score to the fullest potential, use them to late and you will have missed your chance to win! Nice balance between tactics and luck. Scales well! Board can become kind of a blur with all those different colours.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I think the biggest draw of this game is that every player can score when a city is completed, even if they didn't do anything to complete that city.  The different styles of scoring cards are also very intriguing because they have a fairly even mix of scoring for the just completed city vs. scoring for things outside that city.  The game also has a very well-designed catch-up mechanism that will help a player come from behind (but doesn't hand that player the game.

BUT (and that's a huge but) this game is agonizing if you ever play with someone who suffers from analysis-paralysis.  Because you don't know where or when a city will be completed it becomes quite difficult to plan ahead any scoring.  And since the points for each card are completely calculable, a player can sit there when a city is completed and spend 10 minutes figuring out which of his cards will score the most points.  This drags the game to a screeching halt and makes it something that I've traded away rather than something I will keep in my collection.  Played with a group of fast decision-makers this could be fun, but played with my family it's a disaster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There doesn't really seem to be any possible way to plan a complete strategy throughout the game (other than your placement during scoring; the catch-up mechanic is very powerful), and luck can get in the way of your strategy working anyway, so the game seems to be a succession of short-term plans.  The mechanism for helping the last place player might be a bit too powerful, so I guess the way to go is stay behind the pack, hoard some big point cards, and blow them all on the last few turns.  Needs a better endgame mechanism.  Certainly visually appealing with high quality, colorful wooden pieces.

I like placing walls and building cities.  But, the hand of cards as scoring goals takes a lot of potential strategy out of the game since players really only know what their current goals are and not what any of the other players are going for, or what their own future goals will be.  Still, I think it's a nice filler level game. Could also work for non-gamers as it's not much more complicated than Yahtzee (and about the same skill level).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a fairly family-friendly game which can be lost because of a series of bad card draws, but there are mechanisms built into the game which do work to prevent that from happening.  I'd play it most times, though the face on the cover and the backs of the cards might give nightmares to children!

I enjoyed my single play of it.  If you draw the right card again and again late in the game, you can score a tonne of points.  This makes it feel like your early decisions don't matter as much as late card draws.  I could be wrong though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good stuff.  I enjoy how this one flows...you want to work on scoring with your cards, but at the same time, you want to use what others are doing to your best advantage.  Don't underestimate the power of being in last, as you can change out your cards, if need be.  Even tho I squeaked out a victory, I was never trailing and wasn't able to maximize my score at the end of the game. 

Update: Not sure if I'm going to raise the rating, yet, but the game clicked even more for me.  It's tactical, but at least with two, you can work for something with some planning.  You will go through scoring cards so you do want to make sure you have something at the end that is worthwhile and will net you some points.  Hold on to some, discard to give you more options instead of scoring minimal points.  Sometimes you might want to create scoring and not score just to give yourself more and better options with your cards (discarding gets you an extra card) and if you can fall back into last, you can swap.  What is also interesting is certain cards are better at certain parts of the game.  I really enjoyed this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Masons is a light eurogame but it has some nice ideas like cards vs. time managing. I like the decisions you have to make in order to keep a card for a later (and probably better) scoring phase against finally being unable to play all cards you have planned because the game could end before you expected.

Update September 2014: after playing a bit on Yucata, I have to walk back my comment about always having a big city develop. In fact, in most of the games I have played against experienced players there, the city count is usually low and the city size average very small. Makes the game MUCH better. I may have to make this a 10 after all!

The ONLY thing that keeps this from a '10' in my book is that the variation in the usefulness of the scoring cards is a little too wide, in my opinion. I kind of wish there was a legitimate chance of not having a 'mega city' (defined arbitrarily by me as consisting of 20+ areas) by end of game, because it devalues some of the scoring cards. Nevertheless, I always have a fantastic time playing Masons.

This is a fun game.  Don't let the apparent lack of control fool you - there is quite a bit you can do to influence the pacing of the game and put yourself ahead.  All your decisions are made "at the margins".  It's relaxing, because to an extent you're at the mercy of the dice, but at least it doesn't have the angst of card drafting like TTR. You're trying to influence the city's growth to some small degree - that's all you can really do.  Certainly not a brain-burning "gamers game" but there is definitely room for clever play and baiting your opponents.

Regular scoring based on pieces inside the current city and outside all cities makes the choice of scoring interesting.

Good abstract game with dice-rolling and card-drawing mechanics.

A mediocre game from a mediocre designer. Yawn.

RATING: 4
[21/8/06] I consider MauerBauer another bland Leo Colovini design. The pasted on theme doesn't really work on a number of levels. How and where walls are placed, for instance, has little bearing to reality. Same can be said of the way the region is transformed and parcelled out by the walls. You may say this is of little importance (as Colovini is bound to believe), yet I consider a good theme-mechanics match a criterion in examining a design's quality. 

Mechanically, the cards greatly differ in their usefulness and card draw luck has a too decisive impact on the game, making it lighter fare than it'd otherwise be. Yet, such calculational gameplay and effectively themeless nature rarely make a winning combination when coupled with such randomness.

Not only do I personally not enjoy it, I also consider it a rather mediocre design.

Excellent game this one with loads to influence the game starting with your placement of wall and then the random choices of which side of the wall to put the house and whether to complete a city and score and which cards to use when you score. 14 Plays.

A good, tactical game with a little bit of deduction, with no screwage factor that so often accompanies tactical games.  Light, has a pretty good luck element.  Although, to counteract that, I would say that you should just go in to this game with no strategy, and work around your hand.  If you have a plan in mind, you are going to miss out since the board can change drastically with every play.  Once you have an idea of what is in the deck, this will guide how and when you score, and when you draw more cards to give yourself chances of seeing strong scoring cards.  The game is quick, beautiful, and gives players the opportunity for really dramatic and clever play.  A winner in my book.

Good easy game to play with hidden point cards. I think some of the cards seem unbalanced and the dice rolls are a bit frustrating at times. The game still does interest me because it is lighter and plays quick without direct confrontation. It's also pretty to look at end game to see the final results on the board.

I actually don't think this is that great of a game, but on the other hand, I really liked playing it.  It's hard to explain.  It's very lucky.  You basically get a handful of score cards giving you a certain number of points for a variety of conditions on the board, such as tower pieces on the coast.  Making those conditions occur as much as possible for scoring time is the trick, and that's not easy, since a lot of your placement depends on dice-rolling.  It may get more strategic as you play it repeatedly with the same crowd, and people develop an awareness of the pool of scoring cards.

This is a very nicely balanced game with really nice bits.  The only problem at all is the yellow line that divides the board into territories is hard to notice, especially once the wall pieces start covering it up.  We generally play 2-player, and played once with 4.  It works great and offers thoughtful choices either way.  This game has exactly what we like: a short, clear ruleset and interesting gameplay.

The varying importance of different cards depending on how far into the game everyone is, combined with the luck of the draw for those cards, makes this game a little too luck driven for me in spite of the choices the game offers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I enjoy the colorful components and the tactile nature of the game. The turns are quick and fluid, so down-time is minimal. It feels like luck may overwhelm decision-making at times, with the dice rolling and the luck of the card draws for scoring.....but it plays quickly enough that this is forgivable. For a light filler, I like Masons. The tension between trying to play more scoring cards (by game end) and limiting your hand size is a particularly nice touch.

I really like this game. Leo Colovini has impressed me in the past and this game follows along some of the same principles. Their is some luck as to what gets built but you control the where, when and what to score. Card management is really the heart of the game. You also need to pay close attention to your opponents and try to counter act what they are building on. Easy to teach and quick to play.

Castello (the Dutch name) is a bit of an oddity for a Colovini: usually his designs are luckless, but not this one. Players take alternating turns in building walls in a grassy landscape, and then after throwing three dice, towers and a house on either side of the wall. As soon as an area is enclosed by walls a 'city' is formed, triggering a scoring round. All players can play up to 2 cards from their hand, indicating what they want to score. It all plays smoothly and quickly: it has that indescribable feeling of 'polished' or 'finished'. As with all Colovinis, the subject is quite abstracted, and could have been easily left out. But somehow, it seems to 'fit' the game rather well.

The main problem plagueing this title is that there is no way to predict what cards your opponents are holding onto. There might be some merit in watching patterns like someone placing along the coast or something, but it doesn't tell you how much points they intend to bag. What I did notice is that it is rare that other players can match the amount you yourself obtained in a scoring round, leading to the obvious strategy of scoring as efficiently as possible on your turn, and as high as possible on your opponent's. While you have quite a few liberties how to set up such scoring events, you are mostly playing your own game, with only unintentional interference from your opponents. This is exacerbated with more than 2 players, where you *really* have to make the most of what you are dealt.

Initially, I harboured some hope that there was more to Castello than throwing dice and scoring as well as you can, but repeated plays proved me wrong. It is friendly, and good starter material, but there is almost no [i]game[/i] here, unless you want to equate a variant of 'throw dice and see who has the highest number' with 'game'. I've dropped my rating considerably because of this. The only reason it stays in my collection is because it looks kind-of nice, and therefore cannoy be wrong in the eyes of my partner.

[b]Update[/b] There are numerous people who claim that there is more control than meets the eye and that the game is consequently underrated: bollocks. Given a situation on the board some cards score [i]significantly more[/i] (up to 1 order of magnitude) points than others, and if [i]you[/i] don't draw these, then you're only increasing the odds that someone else [i]does[/i]. There is no way the odd rules regarding card draws allow to compensate for this, making Castello skirt dangerously close to the precipe of a broken design. Rating degraded by another point. This game is a dysfunctional mess and should not have been released in this form.

This game is very addictive. Best for two or three.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** Uno de los juegos más adictivos de los últimos tiempos y muy probablemente el mejor juego de Leo Colovini. Con un factor suerte medio-alto. Se convertirá en un clásico porque se jugará mucho.

Masons o Mauerbauer: la adicción moderna en estado puro.

Masons o Mauer Bauer es un juego hecho por Leo Colovini. El tablero esta dividido en zonas triangulares al estilo del Transamérica. Al principio de la partida se reparten 6 cartas a cada jugador (son las únicas cartas que hay) y se coloca el marcador de puntos del color del jugador en la zona para puntuar. Cada jugador va tomando su turno uno detrás de otro haciendo lo siguiente:

1) Coloca obligatoriamente un muro en un lado cualquiera de los lados de los triángulos del tablero (no se puede colocar dentro de ciudades completadas). Hay 33 murallas todas del mismo color; son las piezas alargadas blancas.
2) Lanza los 3 dados; si se lanza los dados antes de colocar el muro se resta -1 al jugador (no se puede tener menos de 0 puntos.
3) Uno de los dados indica el color de la torre que se debe colocar obligatoriamente si puede a un extremo del muro colocado (son los vértices del triángulo), si el otro extremo esta vacío, el jugador debe coger la torre del color que quiera y colocarla allí. Existen 3 colores de torres con 10 fichas de cada una. Si no hay torres del color del dado se coge de otro color.
4) Los otros dos dados indican los colores de las casas que se deben colocar a cada lado de la muralla puesta este turno, se debe colocar una a cada lado si es posible (una solo si se esta a una orilla) como el jugador elija. Hay 12 casas de cada color en 5 colores. Si no hay casas del color del dado se coge de otro color.
5) Si al colocar el muro se cerró completamente una ciudad (están todas las murallas unidas) se pasa a una fase de puntuación en lo que se hace lo siguiente:
	A) El jugador puede quitar uno o varios muros de la ciudad que se acaba de completar para así unirse a otra ciudad (no se pueden quitar muros para unirse a otras 2 o más ciudades de golpe).
	B) Todas las casas de dentro de la ciudad completada se consideran como dentro del mismo espacio. Cada 2 casas del mismo color se debe sustituir por una pieza de palacio de ese color si queda.
	C) Se debe quitar los muros y torres incompletos de dentro de la ciudad completa.
	D) Cada jugador puede puntuar o no puntuar jugando cartas , el jugador activo empieza y elige entre (luego siguen el resto de los jugadores):
		D1) Puntúa una o dos cartas de la mano y roba una o
		D2) No puntúa y se descarta de una y roba dos.
	E) El jugador o jugadores con menos puntos se pueden descartarse de X cartas y robar X. 
	F) Fin del turno.


El juego se acaba al final de la fase de puntuación cuando se acaben las fichas de un tipo en todos sus colores. Las cartas si se acaban se barajan de nuevo. Gana el que más puntos tenga y en caso de empate gana el que más cartas tenga.

El intríngulis del juego está en maximizar la puntuación de las cartas que tengas en la mano de tal manera que las fichas que coloques sirvan para eso y para estorbar al contrario, lo cual es muy importante. Por ello es bastante importante tener algo de memoria para saber las cartas que se han usado y faltan por salir, creo que a la gente joven le puede venir muy bien este juego por eso.

Hay 60 cartas 2 de cada una y se diferencian básicamente en 3 tipos:
Las que tienen el fondo verde sirven para puntuar en todo el tablero en las ciudades incompletas o abiertas; las del fondo blanco (sin fondo) solo sirven para puntuar en la ciudad que se acabo justo de completar. Luego existen dos cartas especiales que puntúan 1 punto por todas las ciudades completas incluyendo la actual.

En las cartas de ciudades completas existen estas cartas:
	1) Puntuar por el tamaño de la ciudad completada: 6 puntos si tiene exactamente un triángulo, siete puntos si tiene dos, ocho si tiene tres y 9 si tiene siete o más, hay dos de cada una con un total de 8.
	2) Puntuar un punto por cada casa y 3 puntos por cada palacio. Hay 2 cartas para cada uno de los 5 colores con un total de 10.
	3) Puntuar por el color de las torres 2 puntos. Hay 2 cartas por cada uno de los 3 colores con un total de 6.
	5) Puntuar un punto por cada torre sea del color que sea, 2 cartas.
	6) Por tener dentro de la ciudad casas y/o palacios en varios colores puntúas: 4 puntos con 2 o 3 colores diferentes y 7 con 4 o 5 colores, 2 cartas.
	7) Puntuar un punto por cada palacio de la ciudad, dos cartas.

En las cartas de ciudades incompletas existen estas cartas:
	1) Puntuar un punto por cada casa que haya. 2 cartas en cada uno de los 5 colores, total 10 cartas.
	2) Puntuar un punto por cada casa que haya sea del color que sea pero tienen que estar dentro de las zonas de los escudos de la carta que indica. Hay 3 zonas de escudos cada una con 2 cartas con un total de 6 cartas. En el tablero están marcadas las zonas de los escudos por las franjas rojas.
	3) Puntuar 2 puntos por cada torre que haya, 2 cartas en cada uno de los 3 colores con un total 6 cartas.
	4) Puntuar 1 punto por cada torre sea del color se sea, 2 cartas.
	5) Puntuar 2 puntos por cada torre sea del color que sea pero tiene estar en la zona costera con mar. 2 Cartas.
	6) Puntuar un punto por cada muralla incompleta. 2 Cartas.


Es uno de los juegos más adictivos de los últimos años y seguramente el mejor juego del autor. Es un poco difícil saber a quien recomendarlo, tal vez sea un juego que valga para gente tanto jugadora como no jugadora pero lo que no cabe duda es que el juego es muy sencillo y hecho siguiendo las pautas de juegos mas modernos.

Gran juego con un factor suerte medio-"alto" con un poco de matemáticas en las cartas (las cuales son todas matemáticamente muy iguales) y muy bueno para dos personas. Las cartas son pequeñas y los gráficos y materiales son muy correctos. Creo que se convertirá en un clásico porque sin lugar a dudas se jugará mucho.

Al final me quedo la reseña mas larga de lo que pensaba y aun así se me han quedado algunos detalles en el tintero cómo los siguientes:

El juego es totalmente independiente del idioma y se juega y en 40 min. o mucho menos con un poquitín de práctica (3 partidas)y que es bastante abstracto. Los dos dados iguales son los de poner casas los cuales en el dado de 6 caras usa una cara para cada color mas un interrogante con el que puedes poner la del color que quieras. En el dado de torres tienes 2 caras para cada color de torre lo que hacen las 6 caras. Cuando puntúas las cartas las tienes que descartar.

No dudéis en preguntar lo que queráis de este juego que personalmente me encanta y el precio que vale seguro que amortizáis el juego por el número de partidas que vais a tener.

La reseña que escribí te puede valer para jugar el juego perfectamente sin errores que es una de las cosas que pretendía con ella y los pasos que puse te valen para hacer una chuletilla de ayuda.

En las fases del juego, hay que añadir una cosa en la sección FINAL DE JUEGO, en las reglas españolas e inglesas se entiende perfectamente.

El Mauerbauer casi es mejor jugarlo con 2 o 3 personas aunque podrían jugar 5 (o 6) sin problemas. Parece que es un juego que tiene bastante azar, el caso es que en la mayoría de las partidas los marcadores acaban muy ajustados (sobre todo si son pocos jugadores) por algo será.

Yo creo que es un juego muy apto para una gran parte de la gente no jugara o para enseñar a jugar a un amigo o la novia y en el que la gente jugadora lo puede pasar bien. Por cierto, en http://www.yucata.de/ se puede jugar.[/COLOR]

Played once with 2p. There is a lot of randomness in this, with the die rolls and card draws.  Not something I'd play often with serious gamers.

Production: Great wooden pieces in elegant, interesting shapes.  The board is attractive.

Play: Part of me thinks that there is very little interaction in this game, as it seems impossible to predict what an opponent's scoring cards are, and thus we might as well work together to build a very large city, since it is as likely to benefit me as my opponent.  Nonetheless, I found it to be fun and interesting.  I also like the rapid turnover of the scoring cards, and the way the cities merged. (3+2+1) (2 plays)

A fun building game where you need to make things happen based on the cards in your hand. It seems to have that perfect balance of strategy and luck. The rules are well thought out and the game itself has beautiful components. 

Unique dice, cards, towers, walls, buildings....they're all used together in perfect harmony. Fast turns and excellent balancing features keep everyone involved until the end. Everyone has a chance to score, but do you want them to score? 

Place a wall and roll the dice....

Players place wall sections onto a game board, filling it out with houses and towers.  When an enclosed wall area is created, a city is completed and players each get to drop scoring cards down (or exchange them) to achieve goal points.  Very colourful game, with about three rules to remember - the rest is in the scoring cards.  Nice balancing elements - if you shoot out to a lead, your scoring cards drop down, forcing you to trade up (and not score) during future rounds.  I wasn't expecting much from this one, but I enjoyed it.  I should trust Hans im Glueck more.  Good game.

It's a glorified connect the dots and color in the squares game that you play on kid's menus in restaurants.   The kicker here is that everyone is playing cards to score the spaces (triangles, in this case).   Big wooden pieces look cool, but the replayability is probably fairly low.

Another good Colovini game for the family. Mr. Colovini always seems to come up with an interesting mechanism for each of his games. I particularly like the ability to determine how you score and when. There can be a bit of luck with the cards, and the three sectional cards can be overpowering if used towards the end (and the board is open). Update: The boys never really warmed up to this one and there are other games I prefer to play with the wife. Traded.

Masons is a strange little game.  You will place a wall and roll dice to place houses on each side of the wall and towers at each end of the wall.  If a number of walls enclose an area, scoring for all players happen.  Each player has a hand of scoring cards which influences where they will place their walls throughout the game.  When scoring happens each player can play 0, 1, or 2 scoring cards followed by drawing one scoring card from the stack.  This allows people to alter their hand size.  After scoring happens, the person in last place on the score track can exchange cards in their hand for cards in the supply as a catch-up mechanism.  Overall, it's pretty quick but didn't really feel overly enjoyable.

Supposed to be a light "gateway" game but there are many better games in this category - Settlers of Catan, for instance. For one, randomness from the dice in SoC can be planned for. Not so in Masons! And Masons has the kind of theme that has absolutely no connection with the mechanics. Overall, nothing here that really grabs me.

Really good, modern, constructive game. Once you understand how the scoring cards can optimise for you, the game is surprisingly open. The possibilities change throughout the game. Sometimes the open field cards are worth more, sometimes the towers become important. You have simple choices and see what cards the other players discard can be informative. The scoring can create very wide gaps, but the players stillcaught up and finished very closely. The artwork on the box is horrible, the board could be better too, but the cards and pieces are really nice. Not quite a 10 for me, Leo Colovini has re-used the coloured dice from Carolus Magnus so luck can matter, but it may still rise in my favours. Definitely a must buy game. *** Actually lowering my score to 8.5 simply because I am tiring a little of it. It's very good for what it is, but it doesn't offer a lot of choice after several plays. A solid, original board game design, but I'm not getting a buzz.

Initially, I didn't like this game, as it seemed like the game just caused the players to constantly merge cities until one giant massive city sits in the middle of the board.  After talking it over briefly with my opponents and then thinking about it more, my impression of the game improved a bit.  The big strategy in this game seems to be whether or not to merge adjacent cities, followed distantly by wall placement.  Everything else is largely random.

RATING: 7
Probably the game that Colovini wanted to improve on Carolus Magnus.  I prefer Masons because the randomness here is not the entire balance of the game.  The choices of how and where to expand drives the scoring opportunities for all; this keeps everyone in the game in unusual and sometimes unexpected ways.  Plays really well for the dreaded 3 player situation.

An interesting game of laying walls across a board to build and complete cities of various sizes.  Points are scored when a city is completed based on the cards in each players hands.  It's a neat game that certainly looks very nice, but it seems that the luck of the draw in which cards each player acquires adds too much luck for gamers to play too seriously.

Maybe not as dry as other games from this designer, but that's is not due to the theme (totally absent here) but more from the unusual randomness for a Colovini. This randomness makes it so that you're never quite out of the game, but it also means that a couple of lucky draw, especially late in the game, can throw the result one side or another.

Lovely game and easy to learn and play after you figure out the cards. I found it relaxing to play as well. Something short for gamers and non gamers alike. I found it was a bit abstract (dry) though just because there is not much of any player interaction. But its beautiful like that. Thanks Kara (Kara31) for the Christmas gift!

Két kétszemélyes játék után nem igazán tudom, hogy mit írjak. Az biztos, hogy egyszerűek a szabályok, és elég egyedi a játék. Sok-sok kártyát játszunk ki, de elég egyedi módon, itt ezzel nem a játékot vezéreljük, hanem pontokat szerzünk. Sok-sok kisebb nagyobb pontot a kártyák időzítése szerint. Eközben egy térképen városokat, városfalakat, tornyokat építünk lehetőleg úgy, hogy a kezünkbe éppen aktuálisan lévő pontozókártyákat majd minél több pontért tudjuk kijátszani egy-egy város befejezésekor.

Az biztos, hogy messze nem elhanyagolható benne a szerencse szerepe. Gyanítom, hogy ez több játékossal még dominánsabbá válik, mivel kevesebb ráhatásunk lesz az építkezésre. Ugyanakkor egy-egy építésből lehetetlen rájönni az ellenfél kártyáira, így nem annyira lehet ellenne tenni, innentől pedig pusztán a szerencsén múlik, hogy mennyire játszunk az ellenfeleink alá.
Mindeközben ez valahogy mégsincs annyira az arcunkba tolva, és elég sokat lehet agyalgatni, miközben nincs az az érzés, hogy minden mindegy, mert úgyis a szerencse dönt.

Szóval nem is olyan rossz ez játék, ha ennyit tudok róla írni. :)

Masons is a very tactical placement game with a significant luck factor. Some scoring cards are clearly better than others although which is which can and will change throughout the game. There is, however, almost always a way to improve your scoring opportunities regardless of which cards you got.

The catch-up mechanism that lets the last player freely exchange scoring cards seems to be very strong, and is more likely a late addition from the publisher rather than the designer's choice.

This game is great! At first, it's a little disorienting having a great big board and nowhere to start, but it quickly gets interesting. I have played it with 2, and I like the lack of confrontation without becoming multi-player solitaire. Spouse really enjoyed it, too.

My beef with it is the instruction manual. While it has good examples of scoring, the rules and odd exceptions are a bit spread out. Some are easy to miss. A summary page would be nice.

Forget the complaints on the luck, and the randomness of the dice rolls, Masons is a clever game that offers interesting and often difficult decision making.  Masons is a game dependent on a player's timing and ability to make tactical shifts to any stategies developed by card holdings. The dice in Masons, as in other Colovini offerings and other titles (Carolus Magnus, e.g.) forces you to make the aforementioned tactical decisions.  By the color of tower and buildings being determined for you, it then becomes about the players ability to change with the greatest effect. Timing is a key issue here in relation to scoring.  If you choose poorly when to score you can put yourself in bad standing, and aid your opponents more than helping ones self. This kind of reverse thinking, and in games like Mammoth Hunters, where decisions have to be made that inevitably will help others are the charms that  make Masons so enjoyable to me. I find Masons to be a light weight game with real decisions. Naysayers in my opinion are gamers who dislike the necessity to have to constantly adjust to an ever changing board.  The feeling of chaos that games like Masons arouse in my opinion are misunderstood.  This isn't a game that penalizes creating strategies, it is instead a game that penalizes gamers who get to rigid in their thinking.  Colovini may have a reputation for providing dry abstracts, but for me his offerings provide various exercises in solving problems effectively.  Colovini games although thin in their adhesive to applied themes allow for freshness where gaming really matters, in thinking.

UPDATE:  With more plays I have raised Masons to a 9.

Masons is a very fun and well crafted abstract game. Though it does have a tad bit of luck involved. Even so, it is a pretty well balanced game. It looks great with bright distinguishable colors and lots of wooden game pieces. Game length is perfect. It neither seems too short nor too long and plays well with any number of players.

I'd say this is a midweight game only because it may take a few plays, before some of the strategies become apparent to you and to get a better feel of how and when to play your scoring cards.

This is a really good game that is a lot of fun to play. You can't go wrong especially for the low cost of the game which is another huge plus.

Plenty of room for clever play, with just enough luck to keep you on your toes.  Don't let the ugly and bizarro box scare you away.  Why is the Mason wearing a smoking jacket?  Maybe it's a gown?  Is he in the Stray Cats Fan Club?  Who knows.  This is a fun game.

RATING: 6
A game that is largely about hand management and timing. After one play the key seems to be to manage your hand so that you keep the potential very high scoring cards for the right time, while staying close enough to the leader without falling behind. With more experience it is probably more about recognizing if someone is going for a lot of late game scoring and either riding coat tails or accelerating the game end making several smaller cities to prevent large scoring cards from realizing their potential. I liked it more than I thought I would as there is not a whole lot of interaction between players. Looking forward to another play but not as interesting as Bridges, Clans, or Carolus Magnus.

An otherwise enjoyable game spoiled by (1) the "Dots and Boxes" nature of the wall placements, in which the player bringing the walls within one segment of creating a city will lose control over the shape and size of the city, and (2) the inability to prevent a determined opponent from creating a mega-city.  A neat idea, but mathematically flawed.

My secondmost favorite Colovini game (after Cartagena). Not nearly as random as some people claim as you can relatively easy deduce what people are trying to score by their actions, and if you keep getting lousy cards will you be able to dump them all to acquire a better hand. Knowing the right time to use the different types of score cards is important.

I think I'll enjoy it more with more players, but I still doubt it will be anything special. *UPDATE* Played again with 3 players, and enjoyed it much more. It seemed to play a little quicker as well. It's a very nice game. The player aid showing all the cards is a great help for new players. Bottom line, it's a nice, light game. I think the random draw of the cards can be unbalancing, but the game doesn't last too long so it isn't a big deal.

The scoring card system feels pretty fresh: You don't own anything, or even temporarely control anything. It works fairly well for a light game, but there's one catch: The game length can vary significantly based on the board's development. If I read the rules correctly, whenver anything is removed from the board, it's put back into the supply. This means that if there are many city mergers, the game can take significantly longer than what the box claims. I;ve played a 2 player game that took 80 minutes!

Update (10/01/11): A number of people in my gaming group detest this game--I don't understand why. It is a cute little Euro.

Update (01/16/12): A friend gave away this copy to me that he thrifted for a couple of bucks. It's not a bad game. Light, easy to teach, interesting choices. Players accumulate VP by trying to develop the board to match patterns depicted in secretly drawn cards. Like Ingenious, some structure that you develop may eventually garner more points for another player! There is luck of the draw of the cards as to what structure/pattern you must create, but beyond that, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's a great way to relax after an intense evening of heavy games, but I wonder if it would work as an appetizer? It's a solid '7'.

An interesting variant on Dots & Boxes, wherein each player has a number of hidden (and randomly determined) goals.  A lot depends on the luck of the draw--I think the cards are much more random than the dice here--and it's very helpful if the other players happen to draw goals that are compatible with yours.  A decent filler, but it can be a little frustrating to have so much depend on whether others are willing to help you out.

Tile placement:hand management:

Not bad for what it is and a touch better than I thought it might be after my slight disappointment in Clans (clans being formed too obvious). This did remind me a little of Clans but this has more elements, is better and not quite as dry although still no real theme. However there is more luck, while Clans has none really this has quite a good dose even though some can be mitigated. 

Mission based cards score you points and timing them is critical, a few are too good while some are quite bad, these can be discarded but for a price. Very scalable from 2 - 4 and I couldn't see why even 5 won't work but not sure if it would be any good, more players will mean more chaos in this game also like Clans. The catch-up mechanic works quite well, maybe a little too well, rating could fall slightly with more plays.

After one play, it seems obvious that those who complain about the "luck" of the scoring cards are not seeing the possibilities of this game.  The cards give you a way to help you determine the style of play you should be pursuing.  This is a "lighter" game on first view, but there are hidden depths here. 
UPDATE:  Moved down.  I'm less convinced that luck doesn't have a big part to play.

I have mixed emotions about this game. It was fun to play but so much depends on what cards you draw to put more emphasis on luck than skill. Like Amun-Re you can play a great game but lose because your opponent got the right cards at the right time and you didn't.

RATING: 7
Played a few times now and can see why people consider that the luck of the draw can make or break your chances of victory.

My game last night was a prime example... I was leading for most of the game and then I could not draw a card that scored more than four points for the last few scoring rounds... I watched helpless as each of the other players passed me.  I discarded my entire hand before the final scoring and managed to draw only one usable card!  I came in last, but I was still only 16 points behind the leader... it was that close!

I find the game to be well balanced and, with average card distribution, should come down to final scoring to determine a winner.  A great addition to any collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid, fast-paced fun from Leo Colovini, whose other designs generally leave me cold. The potential for poor card luck is well-balanced by several card exchange mechanisms. I particularly like the fact that the trailing player may exchange any or all of his/her cards. This not only helps keep the trailing players close to the pack, but also introduces a nice element of strategy in the decision about whether or not to score in certain instances. The fact that the game plays in 30-40 minutes is another mark in its favor.

My rating would be higher if the scoring cards were a bit better balanced. The potential value of most cards depends upon the board setup at the moment of scoring, but some almost always seem to be less valuable than most of the others (e.g., the cards that score 1 point for each completed city or 1 point for each temple in the just-completed city). By contrast, the tower scoring cards may be slightly overvalued. Despite this qualm, Masons is a game I can easily be talked into playing.

So far so good. There are a lot of different kinds of scoring cards so you are always trying to make a move that will benefit you even if you're not the one causing the scoring to occur. The game does seem to have an ebb and flow to it as I've seen players break out to big leads only to have the rest of the pack close in on them as they begin to play with fewer scoring cards. Players really need to decide when they want to score vs discarding and drawing two cards in the hopes of getting better scoring chances. An enjoyable game for me.

RATING: 5
The board is made up of connected triangles forming a grid. On a turn, a players places a wall on one of the lines and then rolls dice to determine what color towers go on the ends of the wall and what color houses to put on either side. When a wall placement encloses an area, players play cards from their hand to score points. All the pieces placed on the board, whether within the city you are scoring or placed onto the board in total, can get you points depending on the card you play. When all of one type of piece has been placed on the board the game ends with a final scoring round. After a scoring, the player in last place can discard and re-draw as many scoring cards as he wishes. Staying in last for the first half of the game in order to build the hand you want for the second half seems like a big part of the strategy.

While placing walls and pieces on the board is pleasant enough - the game has lots of nice wooden pieces - the uneven scoring cards just sap any of the pleasure you can really get out of the game. In the late game, cards that score for the board in total are FAR, FAR more powerful than city scoring cards and really unbalance the game. If you got those cards, you're good. If you don't, you're screwed.

RATING: 8
Playing this game kind of felt analogous to trying to time and make money in the stock market, without being able to choose which "stocks" you got (i.e. scoring cards), but being able to exercise some influence over "the market" (i.e. the cities, walls, towers, houses, etc.) You can identify trends happening on the board that help you evaluate how good/poor your cards are and need to make decisions on which ones to dump.  After one play I enjoyed it, but one criticism I have is that it didn't seem like you could realistically do anything to thwart someone else's plans.

UPDATE:  I was on the verge of putting this title in the trade pile but I have decided its a keeper and raised my rating to an 8 after playing a nailbiter of a 2 player game.  I think what did it for me was realizing that hand management is just as important, if not more important than what is going on on the gameboard.

The game looks nice with the walls, towers, houses, and palaces. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer much depth. Put down a wall, roll dice to guide the color of palace and houses to place. Once a city is completed everyone has a chance to score based on the cards they hold. Some of the cards allow more strategy to set up for a score, but most seem like you need to get lucky to score them. Getting lucky enough to get the more strategic cards seems like it gives too much of an advantage. I think there is too little strategy for most adults to enjoy this, but maybe too much strategy that when playing with kids you would likely win.

Luck doesn't play the important role as it seems on first sight. I won almost 3/4 of my more than 60 online games. Interestingly, you have to make happen on the board what you have been dealt in  your cards.

The balancing mechanism gives the player with the least points the possibility to exchange as much cards as he wants. Hence, the right timing for the switch from staying behind and building up the right cards to scoring big points usually decides the games. This mechanism is too strong. This might kill the game for me in the medium-term.

Mechanics are very Colovini. I don't think I like this as much as Clans or Cartagena or Go West; it's about on par with Alexandros, maybe a bit more going on.

A city-building game with many interesting options. Everyone is developing the same cities and sharing the same buildings.

It's not that it's boring or fiddly or difficult...it plays fairly fast actually, and the rules are pretty simple. However, it quickly becomes apparent that you have very little control over what happens. You can plan for very little, when most of what you place are determined by dice. And scoring? You're just along for the ride, based on what cards you get. I think all the players easily breached 100 points in our first game--it's too easy, and strategically shallow.

The game is a bit dry for my taste and it has a lack of theme. Players enclose cities with walls. As a city gets completed people may play up to 2 of their score cards witch allow one to score an aspect of the game, for example one would get points for all the white towers that are not enclosed in any cities. The game seems a bit too random for such a dry game. Over all OK game. 3 stars.

It's a tricky little game by Colovini. It has dice rolling to determine colors that you place on the board, also scoring cards that are randombly drawn; still, I believe it's more than meets the eye (there is more strategy to it than it seems first, also as soon as you start to know the cards you try to play in a way that you don't set up nice scoring options for the other players). At the same time I would guess my non-gamer family (my mother is 71 years old, sister is 42) enjoys it more than gamers would. But who knows: it seems Hungarian buddies, also on average the members of the Hungary guild rate it higher than the average BGG user. Maybe it fits us more? Rating is after first play, but I believe it can get higher with time.

For me, it's easily one of my favorite Leo Colovini games (which isn't my usual cup of tea).  This one has multiple paths towards scoring and hand size can be modified to suit your strategy.  Randomness lies in card draws (but that's where the scoring cards are) and dice rolls so they usually balance each other out tho I'm sure there will be occasional games that will favor/disfavor the lucky/unlucky.  I also really like that half (15) the types of cards score for outside the city and the other half (15 also) score for inside the city.  This creates subtle placement choices (walls especially, placing and taking away) on whether to grow an existing city to make it extremely large, or place walls to make plenty of small or medium sized cities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid game with 2 or 3.  Key decision usually revolves around how far ahead one goes early in the game as the player in last place always has the opportunity to discard their cards and pick up new ones to give him/her a better opportunity to score next time.  You generally want to hang around in the back as long as the opponent(s) don't get too far ahead (fyi - 20 points is not a large deficit in this game!).

I like the abstractness of the game but the scoring is odd. If you can get the right cards at the right time, you will do well. If not, then you're screwed. Also the game seems to reward hording at the beginning. I recommend staying in last place, then hording and swapping cards as needed. Play just enough cards to keep up, but remain in last place. Then when you make your move, you will have all the cards you need to score big. 

I don't see much that can stop this, unless everyone tries it, which would be pretty dull. In short, the random scoring was a bit of a turn-off.

Fast-playing, nice bits, and very easy to teach.

This game is fun, don't play it angsty. Don't think [i]too[/i] much about the 'theme', just play the game, and enjoy the cool wooden bits.

Have picked up playing this again recently, and, this game is ... Fantastic, potentially, with the right people. Maybe only at the right time, and we've gotten lucky. But, somehow, we played again today (2007-12-10) and it clicked, was brilliant. The last game was loooong; everyone played their hearts out. If this happens again, then will rate this a '9' for sure. Until then, rating an '8', in case it is just a fluke. Great game either way.

Possibly Best with 3 *good* players, but may be just as good with 4 *good* players - time will tell. Works well with 2 in any case.

[2007-12-11] Played a fantastic game again today with 2 *good* players, the spread for the win came down to 3 points (I won this time - last time I lost by 1 point!), so raising the rating to 8.5! Oh, this last game was won by me with a final of 208 to 205 - the highest scoring I have yet seen. It was breathtakingly fantastic (will surely be a '9' soon, but I'm just *so* stingy!).

This is a very pretty, VERY abstract game, It's quite soothing and pleasantly rhythmical to play at first but suspenseful toward the end as you wait to see whether you'll get to play the high-scoring cards you've saved up in the hope the the configuration of walls, towers and buildings on the board plays out right. Its main flaw is that there are far too many different (sometimes wildly esoteric) ways in which cards can help you score either to plan ahead much or to guess at what your opponents might be up to.

I want to like the game for the nice bits and the basic mechanics, but when the guildcards show up, the game breaks.

The guildcards are wildly varying in power, and it doesn't really even out over the game - in our games a coastal tower card can usually be scored for 20 early on, and 10 at the end, and that is still way better than most other cards.

I think we need to try some variants, because there is a good game in there, somewhere.

4-26-12--Discovered this game on Yucata.de (great on line turn-based gaming site) and liked it immediately.  First f2f play today w/Miles and I can see it's a winner.  It's a little fiddly with the pieces sliding a bit on the board, but simple and fun.  Iconography on the cards is very easy to interpret.  We liked it!

One of the nice things of this game is that you build all on the same board, building the same stuff. Nothing is owned. It's the goals that are different! 

This is true for many other Colovini Games, e.g. Clans, Incognito, Trans America), but I like this one the most!

A neat little game which just does not work with 3 players. The reason is scoring cards. If two other players have same interest then the 3rd players is just screwed. 

But I am willing to run another 5 games with 3 players to see whether it was just the lack of my own playing skills, but I do not see my rating "6" being upped.

I also did not like the massive unbalance between the scoring cards. Some of them are next to impossible score more than 5p/card while some of them are automatic 8+ points with any extra effort.

Acquired in a trade with Jordan Stewart (JordanZS) for one of my extra copies of B-17.  It arrived on 04 MAY 2010.

Played 2 games at John's with Andrew there as well on 04 MAY 2010. It was the first time for all of us. We did not handle the rule about removing city boundaries very well. Everything else worked just fine. I liked it and so did they. Definitely lots to think about. It is interesting to have the cards, but not the bidding.

Have taught to family and to a couple of guys at BGoM.  Everyone has enjoyed it so far, including me.  5 games and 5 wins (2 were in one evening).

An abstract game as you would expect from Colvini where players are trying to meet conditions on there score cards.  There's a bit of planning and hand-management along with attempts to obstruct your opponents although this last part is hard because you don't know what scenarios are on their cards.  Need further plays to see how much depth there is and if the luck can be minimized with a better understanding of all the scoring possibilities.  UPDATE: after several further plays knocked game rating down a point.  Several opportunities for clever play but quite a bit of luck and even with that I just don't find it too exciting.

There's a fair amount of luck in the game, although you've always got plenty of choices per turn.

RATING: 6.5
Each turn, players are putting a wall, tower and two houses onto the map. Whenver a city is formed, players may use their scoring cards to earn points. The scoring cards give points on either completed cities or award points for buildings outside cities (eg score 1 pt for each tower not in a city). The score cards are key to the game, and it is possible to recycle cards to get more desirable cards. It's a fun game, plays quickly and fairly simple. When you get the right scoring cards, you will have a good game, when you do not get the "right" scoring cards, you game will be just mediocore. Based on this variance, the game isn't something I want to play that often. It's simple, and not complicated, but the luck factor in the scoring cards is fairly substantial.

Rating after one play. Seems like a fun game, but the lack of control may become tiresome over time. You know how many points you will get if you score, but have no idea as to how many your opponent(s) will receive, so scoring is an unknown quantity and there is really nothing that you can do to mitigate.
Plays pretty fast (~45 mins our first time), so just roll with it and have fun.

RATING: 7
Following Leo Colovini's thread of dividing boards into different areas and filling them up in one way or another, Mauerbauer allows great freedom at placing different pieces of wall on the board and enclose areas of different sizes; at the same time, at each end of the wall there must be two towers and at each side two houses, the colour of all which is determined by dice throws. When an area is enclosed, players can score them using cards in their hands, trying to use the most fitting card for each situation.

Considering that Mauerbauer offers players both scope for decisions and lack of control over much of what happens on the board, the ideal pace for it to be played is relaxed, without taking too much thought and learning more through experience than through deep analysis. Taken that way, it's extremely replayable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An excellent Colovini, with just a pinch more theme than usual. Lots of great wooden bits make it a striking, if slightly blinding, conceit. The timing of scoring cards makes for a very interesting parallel strategy with the randomness of the dice decreasing towards the endgame.

RATING: 6
Check out your scoring cards, which could be for big areas, small areas, specific colours, lots of colours, all sorts of things ... and then each turn place a wall to carve out the areas, roll the dice and place towers and cubes, and then each time you create an area score some cards. The more players there are, the less control you have over the construction of the board so you're more dependent on the luck of the cards matching what happens. The catchup mechanism is nice, where after each scoring the lowest scoring player can exchange for better scoring cards. But as the board gets more populated and the score cards score bigger, the scoring cards in the latter half of the game become too unbalanced for mine, and the abstract gameplay itself doesn't warrant playing for the ride alone. As a 2 player it worked ok as you have more shape over the board. Still, there's too much luck involved to make it any more than an occasional play.

In this game, players are attempting to earn points by configuring the board to have various arrangements of towers, walls, and colored houses.  This is good in theory, but the goal cards that people acquire in the game end up making it very random.  Since the goals of both you and your opponents are constantly changing throughout the game, there's really no way to formulate any sort of long-term strategy.  I wish there was some better way of distributing the cards that would fix this.

A surprising little find.  The game lies in the use of the scoring cards.  Score now for what is on the board?  Hold on to them, anticipating even more points on a later turn?  Trade in some seeming 'duds' in hopes for something more profitable?  And at a moment's notice, your opponent, or the dice rolls, can ruin or aid your current thoughts.  Ending on a city build is a bit anticlimactic, but all-in-all, a quite enjoyable abstract with some options.

Superior light and fun game! After 4 plays Masons gets uprated to a 9. Plays quickly and has fun elements of randomness that can be manipulated to some degree, with many decisions to make that will gain just the extra few points needed for the win. Last place card exchange idea is excellent. Cards do impart a degree of luck but it should al  average out in the end. Bits are more to my liking that Cleopatra: SoA, only the region delineations are poor. An excellent comments suggestion has been made to place border wall upside down. This should prove to be a great introduction to Euros game.

Typical Leo colovini games where chance interact with strategy at different level. Some people will find chance to much present du to the cards and dice used through out the game. The theme is not realy relevent. The material is superb. Surely one of the best Colovini. 

Jeu typique de Leo Colovini ou la chance et la stratégie interagissent à différent niveau. Certaines personnes vont trouver le facteur chance trop présent du à la présence des cartes et des dés.

Another hohum Eurogame with a new twist in mechanics, where everyone scores during each scoring round.  The little twists in the Eurogame aesthetics can be troublesome for someone like myself.  The game is short and sweet, and there seems to be a adequate learning curve.  The dice mechanic is rather nice.  Rules from what I could understand from the person explaining them could be a touch better.

This game was very entertaining.  During your turn you place a wall, tower and two colored houses (you roll three dice to determine which one of the three colored towers and which two of the five colored houses).  Scoring occurs when a city (enclosed space with walls) is created.  Everyone has an opportunity to score by playing one or two cards from their hand. Cards determine points.  If you can't score you can discard one card and get two from the draw pile.  What I really like about this game is everyone has a chance to score.  Your plans to create your own city to garner maximum points can be futile since anyone can come along and finish your city causing a premature scoring.

RATING: 6
This is an o.k. light family game. It's an abstract where player moves are partially determined by a roll of some dice and what pieces are available to be played. Because of the system, the scoring cards can yield wildly different point values for different players during different phases of the game. To be sure, this is mostly by design as some cards are meant to be more powerful in the endgame when the board tightens up and some cards are meant to give players a way to score points during the beginning of the game, when the board is more open. There is a little bit of a catch up mechanism, but the randomness of the dice just make some scoring opportunities more lucrative than others. I'd like to also mention that the theme is super weird.

 I like having light games on hand to play with casual and non-enthusiast gamers, but the theme of this one is kind of a hard sell. "Hey gang, let's play a game where we are building walls to score points in some nondescript era in Europe's past." Also the game is not great looking either. The game pieces are attractive, but the map, scoring track, and cover art are hideous looking. I have no idea why the publisher doubled down on the dude on the cover art and put his douchey face on the back of the cards and the game board. It's a hilariously bad drawing and having it plastered everywhere is a hilariously bizarre choice.

Decent, light, abstract/euro strategy game.  Depending on player inclinations, this game can range from chaotic (very quick, highly random, and not much scoring) to fairly controlled (tight, lots of card turnover, fairly strategic, but a bit long).  Overall, this game feels a little too long for what it is.

I've only played this once, with someone who I don't game with often - but I quite enjoyed it, without ever feeling it was a game I'd want to play often. I suppose it's really a bit random, in terms of which cards you get and which other players do, but timing when to play each scoring card - and whether to score 1, or 2, or none to draw more cards - is really quite an interesting decision, even relatively late in the game. And where to place your wall, given that you don't yet know what you'll roll, isn't straightforward either.

But while I did quite enjoy that one game, I also didn't think that I'd be sad if I never played it again - and while very playable, it's certainly nothing special. So I think a 6 rating is fair, although I think it's fairly close to being a 7.

--Oct2007-- After one 3p game, I'm not quite convinced that the player isn't completely at the mercy of the cards drawn.  It may well be that skillful play would allow one to maximize the potential of any hand drawn - but it appears that some cards are much stronger than others, and the one that draws the most of the strong ones will win.  I'd be willing to play again occasionally to test the hypothesis; but I fear that if confirmed, my rating would fall.

Colovini is one of my favorite designers which is odd since I generally don't like abstracts.  Masons is a light, quick game that has quite a bit of luck but this can be alleviated by clever play.  Try to play to the strength of your cards and hope that others don't ruin your plans.  Its a game where it is necessary at times to try and work with others in order to be successful.

You can guess it's by Leo Colovini - Clans, Carolus Magnus, etc. If you like those two games of his you might enjoy this one too. There's some interesting ideas to be had in this one for an abstract game, but overall it's a dull affair.

Experience is really going to count - managing your cards and seeing how to get the maximum points out of each type of card is what wins it. That said, the game is so easy to pick up and understand that by about a third of the way through you'll already have a fair bit of experience under the belt. Enjoyable and solid game as usual from HIG, but it's not going to knock my socks off. From Colvini I still prefer The Bridges of Shangri-La for thinking things through, or Clans for light and fast - hard to see me asking for this to come to the table. The game plays close, downtime is minimal, choices are plenty. Good with two - might be best with three - my experience with four is that it's a bit chaotic. I refute the luck of the cards argument against this game - there's so many opportunities to manage your cards and wait and engineer good card scoring. I especially appreciate that games can play so differently with varied city sizes and the merging of cities.

What a pleasant surprise! 

At first the mechanics seemed rather clunky (read: unnecessarily complicated) and altogether too random (read: dice and card drafting), but after one play my pre-misconceptions were proven to be just that - misconceptions.

A fun and tactical game that works well as a "gateway game".

Another solid Colovini. Simple to explain, short, and very tactical. I'm fairly concerned about the randomness of the cards--especially since that's what determines your score. "Awesome! I drew the one card that lets me go from scoring nothing to scoring 18 points! Yes!" The dude on the cover is the creepiest mason I've ever seen...

RATING: 2
The wall placement provides some interesting spatial strategy, and the dice determining what color you place emphasizes the importance of flexibility. But the objective cards are too atrocious. Complete your objectives, hope your opponent doesn't complete as many... it takes away the blocking aspect that makes abstract-strategy games fun. Colovini likes long-term objectives, like that in Clans, but at least that is deduced from a set of 3-5 choices, creating opportunities for bluffing and signaling. This has too many secret objectives, and it's stripped bare on Yucata when you literally complete your objectives and don't even see what cards your opponents play (which reminds you that "hey, I don't care what they play!).

Disappointing, as there seemed to be a good game in the interesting spatial placement.

1+1

It's a pretty decent game, though a bit too random for me - and that's saying something!  It feels like regardless of the cards you get, your decisions don't have that big an impact.  If you get crappy cards, you are doomed, simple as that.  I do like the catchup mechanic where the guy in last gets to cycle out some of his cards.  Still pretty decent though.

After some additional plays, it seems that the best strategy is to not play cards at all if you are the 2nd player in hopes of setting up a single big-scoring play in the last round.  I have dropped this to a 5 and it immediately goes onto my For Trade list.

Comments like, 'Classic Colovini' worry me because his games have been hit and miss with me. I like Carolus Magnus (had a strange charm to it) but I didn't enjoy Clans and Bridges of Shangri-La...so the jury is still out for me on this one.

Update: Wow. What a game. Designers are known for rehashing their designs. In some cases, it turns out badly. In this case, Colovini has taken many aspects of his other abstracts: Carolus Magnus and Clans and given a new spin on the game.
The board evolves, grows and shrinks in a strangely absorbing fashion and players are always trying to place pieces in order to score high for themselves whilst restricting others. Hand mangement is another issue: do you discard a low scoring card in order to draw 2 cards? Do you play 2 scoring cards now instead of trying to wait for a better opportunity later?

Turns are fast paced but decisions are hard. I think that the luck of the mission card draw and the dice is evened out over the course of the game. Scores were surprisingly close and games are tense and tight. A very compelling game.

For those looking for something more out of your normal games of "Dots and Boxes" look no further.

It is a highly tactical abstract.  Expect a game to be very swingy pointwise, as getting the right cards at the right time helps more than most of what you do.  Sure there is a little bit of planning, but all in all you shoot for immediate goals, score where you can, pass when it doesn't seem worth scoring, then see what happens.  I do like the hand management aspect of the game, and with it the catch-up mechanism works more or less.

All in all, a fun little diversion.

Works fine with two. I can't imagine the chaos playing this with four players, ack.

The board is divided into triangles, with coasts along the both sides. On your turn, you place a wall on an edge, then roll 3 dice: 1 tells you the color tower to place on one side (white, gray or black); you pick for the other side (only 1 tower per vertex, though). The other 2 dice tell you the color of house to play on either side of the wall. It you create an enclosure, this forms a town. Pairs of like-colored houses in a town are removed and replaced with that same color palace (if available). Then, starting with current player, players may play 1-2 scoring cards and draw a replacement card; or discard 1 to draw 2. Cards give you points for various combinations of things on the board (e.g., all white towers unattached to towns, all black towers in the town just formed, coastal towers, etc.). Keep playing until the supply of any type of item (walls, towers, houses, palaces) is exhausted, then everyone gets 1 final scoring opportunity. High score wins.

An abstract game with a pasted on theme, but it seems to work pretty well. I can see the rating falling, though; this might blend in with all the other abstract games about putting cubes down and scoring points.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First of all, forget Caylus, the guy on the cover of this box is the creepiest character in board games.  Do not let this man build your walls.

This game is basically an abstract puzzle game.  In front of you is a grid where each turn a player will place a wall.  Then the player will roll 3 dice that dictate what colors of towers and houses he is going to place around that wall.  When an area is completely surrounded by walls it makes a town and a scoring round proceeds where players play cards from their hand to score points.  Points are scored based on the size of the town, the number and color of houses and towers inside and out of the town, etc.  The goal is simply to make the most points before the number of one of the components runs out.

I don't typically like abstract games which is all this really is but it does have some flare going for it.  The way you can use space and the nice balance of control and randomness are all nicely done.  Deciding when to score a small number of points and when to hold out for bigger pay days is also a nice personal mini-game players have to wrestle with.

That being said there are certainly flaws to this game, the main of which is all the goals are not created equal.  Some are much easier to achieve and worth much more points.  One of the best of which for example is the one that will score you 2 points per certain colored tower in a town.  It is not uncommon or difficult to make 12+ points on this one card which is a lot for this game (the average for a high-scoring card I would put at about 8 points) so drawing a card like this at the right time or multiple times can give you a clear advantage.

I like it enough and think it is a good game but abstract, puzzley titles are still just not my thing.

I've played this mostly at Yucata.de but also in person once. I'm not normally a fan of randomness, but this kind I can deal with. If I place a wall with both ends free, I can get a tower of my choice at a particular spot, and frequently you can get the colored houses where you want them as well. The cards can be vexing, but they don't bother me much for whatever reason.

Yaaaaugh!!!  That guy's face on the cover and the backs of all the cards!  There's something just... icky, and creepy about him!  I dunno!  But it's a fine game in the box anyhow, thank goodness, and I'll rate it an 8 as long as I don't have to have that mugshot in my line of sight.  The simplicity of what you do on your turn (place a wall, the towers if any, and a house on either side) makes it easy to learn, and the odd twist of the cards in your hands being managed to choose your scoring opportunities instead of your action opportunities gives the game character.  I do enjoy many of Colovini's quirky designs, but on first impressions it seems that in this one, everything falls into place, and I think this is going to be my favorite since Cartagena.  (On second impressions, it appears we're going to have to get the ending straightened out!  But I still like it.)

RATING: 7
The standard game is a little more luck driven but can easily be fixed by allowing the players roll the dice before placing the wall. 
The game not only looks good but the gameplay can be so totally different from game to game depending on the collective choices. Some games will have many Cities built from the start. Others will see little development until the end. There will be games finishing a lot earlier than you anticipate if one of the resources runs out and some that turn into marathons.It's all withing the collective control of the players.

Timing your run to the the front and adapting your stratgies to take account of all of the above make this game a real challenge. The components are great to look at and fill the board quickly. Even newbies to boardgames seem to love this one.  

Masons has more wide ranging appeal to gamers of both light and middle weight games than any other game that I have played. It's a game that I would recommended to almost anyone.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very nice strategy game from Colovini.  Feels a little like the children's pencil and paper game "Boxes" but whenever an area is completed everybody scores.  There's just a little too much riding on the luck of the card draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The cards you draw dictate how you can score: some dependent on a city being completed, some dependent on the wider unfinished countryside. This influences your strategy so you work towards certain objectives, while trying to spot & prevent other player's plans.

One snag: my brown-green color blind son cannot spot the region borders (the normal triangulating lines are OK, its just those fuzzy brownish region dividers).

RATING: 10
LATEST NEWS -- Masons plays up to 5 players just fine!  Part building, part hand management, and part timing.  There is a lot going on in this game but it's not overwhelming.  Very good even with 2 players.  Colors of the bits are a little strange but easy to distinguish which is what counts.  I like how little downtime there is -- everyone needs to stay on their toes to be ready for a scoring round no matter whose turn it is.  Some things to watch out for:  if you don't have enough palaces of the required color then leave the houses as is; you form palaces after merging cities; and, the player to take the last piece of any type gets to finish placing and merging before the final scoring round (major error in the English rules).  I like the catch-up mechanic where the last-place player gets to swap cards -- keeps the game very close!  I lost a 2-player game 117-115 -- argh!  And I won a 4-player game where the scores ranged from 178 to 198 so I call that pretty close, and every player had been in the lead more than once.  I'm finally rating this a 10 after 10 plays and still will play this any chance I can.

For the most part, this game is a fairly simple exercise in staying behind, and trading your bad cards, until you got a good hand, and then time the use of these cards to empty your hand just as the game ends. Boring.

A game of trying to fulfill secret objectives with a shared board. Usually I dislike Colovinni games, but this one hits the spots for me. There's enough randomness and uncertainty to keep the abstract play fresh and entertaining, and there's enough planning to keep you thinking.

Interesting, in so much as the scoring your play is determined by a system of cards with different scoring options.

Is this Leo Colovini's best work?  Masons lightens the brain-burn found in many of his titles with nifty use of dice and Eurotacular scoring cards.  The secret is to keep flushing ones hand while occasionally setting up a big score.  Masons is accessible and the metagame of hand management provides an interface point for gamers who are not spatial.

RATING: 7.5
I really enjoy this game. I think maybe I was a little surprised by how much I liked it, even.  

I went through a period when I thought I didn't like abstracts. Colovini changed that. It's not that I didn't like them. I just wasn't playing the right kind. 

So many abstracts are perfect information mental power struggles. Colovini introduces a little chance or unknown into his abstracts (i.e. the cards in Masons, the secret identities in Clans). 

I should have known this years before because I've always enjoyed Backgammon.





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) -4


Overall - 1

RATING: 7.5
Quick, engaging and enjoyable, despite the impact of the luck-of-the-draw (and the roll, I suppose). The ability of the last place player to swap out bad cards every scoring round helps even things up considerably. The great lead swings that can result lend a lot of tension to the game. 

Another plus is that gameplay can be wildly different each time. I've played games with almost no castle building, as two of the three players tried to maximize non-castle towers. Other games can be much more drawn out, with players teaming together to close up small castles and leave fewer non-castle towers.

Has a community play area which is always changing.

I played part of a demo game, but I couldn't finish it.  This is certainly the most thematic Colovini game I have tried.  I like building games in general and this appears to be a good one.  Some people complain that the scoring cards are too random, and I can see how some would have a problem with that, but I play very tactically.  I doubt that I would have that objection.  I look forward to trying a full game or two to find out.

I tried a full game, and I was right.  I don't have any problem with the randomness, and it plays pretty quickly.

Pretty solid.  As far as components, the cards are a little small and the 3 territories are hard to distinguish during the game, but we filled the walls the opposite way to mark territory boundry and it worked pretty well.  Game has a nice mix of skill and luck.  The game seems to replay quite well, as some games will have tons of small cities, while others may have one or two larger ones, and I've even seen games where the first city wont show up on the board for many turns.

I puzzle at my own attraction to this game where the only visible evidence of rivalry is on the scoring track. Action is very mild but you should watch everyone else's move. There is engaging competetion, yet no player ever gets undermined.

Simple, easy, inoffensive fare that is typical of the light, simple Euros that were in vogue in the late 90s and early 2000s.  It feels rather dated, now.  It's interesting enough to be enjoyable enough while it's on the table, but not individual enough that it leaves much of an impression afterwards.  I had a strong feeling of "Oh, this again," but I struggle to remember the games which make it feel so familiar. [gameid=4636], for sure, but beyond that I have difficulty remembering.  Which is what this game is almost certainly going to be for me when I try to remember it in a few years.  "What game?  Masons?  Isn't that the game with the guy that has the crazy hair?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fast tactical, almost abstract game. You place walls on the board, then place towers and houses around those walls. When the walls form a complete area it's called a city, and scoring then happens where each player decides which cards in his hand he'll cash in for points. Cards vary a lot, some give you points for different colour houses, some for towers, some for locations of items, some for city size, etc. So, you're constantly evaluating if a given score card will give you better points now vs later. Or maybe you'll draw a better card. Over time the cities merge into larger cities, so the board can change quite a bit.

I'm not usually into abstract games, but this is very pleasing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 7
Euro style, bit chaotic game with a little tension.  Plays in about 45 minutes to an hour.  An overlooked game by many that takes a few plays to really understand some of the depth.  The choices seem to be made for you based on your dice rolls, BUT you control which cards you will score and how many cards you will score.   The "in the field" cards are more valuable early on and then the "in the city" cards gain more value near end game - especially if walls keep getting removed.

You build walls and towers. You have to roll dice to choose the color of the tower and 2 buildings that you can place. You get points by achieving goals that are on your handcards. Those cards are played when you create a town.

What a deceptively simple game!  The rules are straightforward, and the scoring cards make perfect sense.  Once it all starts getting put together as a whole, though, that's where the challenge of the game comes in to play.  Understanding how to meet your own goals without making it easier for others to complete theirs is key, and it reminds me a bit of Medina in some ways, because you also want to make it easier for someone else to allow you to score your own points.  It's interesting, and seems to be one of those games that takes a lot of plays to develop an optimal strategy.

Update: Haven't played in a while, but a pretty fine family-style game, as the dice keep things from getting too structured.

I love Colovini games.  Many of his games are an optimization of random events.  Because of this, one may see a lot of luck in his games - drawing cards in [gameid=826] or [gameid=11081] or rolling dice in [gameid=481] or Masons.  However, the luck aspect is usually saddled with an optimization choice.  Give one thing up to get two more of that - be it cards or cubes.  In the end, however, it isn't so much as luck but as playing the best with what you have despite the random events occurring around you.

I think people get hung up on the luck aspect of this game such as not getting the right color of tower or house in order to get the really big score.  While that may be disappointing, the object of the game isn't necessarily to build the proper houses or towers, but to score your cards at the proper time in order to maximize your position on the board.  And then there is one little Colovini twist - if you are in last place you have the option, at the end of scoring, to refresh as many cards in your hand as you want.  So, if it isn't final scoring, you may not want to have the best score - only be close, if you have some dud cards in your hand you want to get rid of.

Great conflict - excellent design.  Unfortunately, like many Colovini games, my wife doesn't enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very nice light game with excellent components. Creates the illusion of needing to plan in advance to take advantage of scoring cards, but with so much changing from turn to turn it's hard to do anything other than optimize your current turn while making adaptable plans for the next. I like the ability for the trailing player to cycle scoring cards, as some cards are far, far less valuable than others and the values change frequently during the game. Should "feel" lighter, but does cause some Analysis Paralysis.

I love the bits and presentation of this one and I generally like games that feel strongly abstract... even ones with a healthy dose of luck.  I rather like placing my walls to create the best scoring opportunities for my hand... and the individual rolls usually seem to only give a point here and there (runs of the same house or tower can be a big deal though if you draw the card to exploit them) but wall placement and when (and when not) to join cities seems to be the key to doing well in the game. 

All in all MauerBauer delivers as an enjoyable light abstract-ish game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lots of neat little mechanics such as how the houses are built and merged into palaces; how walls can be torn down to combine cities.  The scoring cards, on the other hand, are just down right unbalanced.  Especially the fact that probably a good half of them become useless as the game progresses, and the most common action people take is to discard in the hopes of drawing something that will worth more than a couple of points.  I would much prefer hidden objectives that you hold and tally at the very end.  Instead of complementing each other, the overall design suffered because of this.

01-30-2015: The picture version of Apples to Apples. I'll play it but I'm not crazy about it.

I'm not sure we will keep this one much longer. We have Mysterium now which is very similar but a much better game.

UPDATE 6-17-15: Traded for Time's Up! in Dice Tower Con Math Trade.

Lovely art, will most likely purchase at some time, maybe when the next Dixit comes out.  I'd ditch the oddessey cards and insert the new artist and mix it all in.

RATING: 7.5
Visually, this game is stunning and the card art is very imaginative. It's fun to see how other players interpret their images to fit the theme each round. It definitely has a party game feel to it, though, meaning the gameplay isn't that deep. If you're in a situation where you need a light game to play, though, or want to play a party-type game, Dixit seems to be a great choice.

While Dixit Odyssey comes with a new voting system, scoreboard and components to support up to 12 players, I really do not see the point of making Dixit: Journey a stand alone game. You get your new cards in an unreasonably big box. That's it. Frankly speaking, the Odyssey could have been just an expansion as well, but here that is even more true.

But never mind my ranting, Dixit: Journey is still of the same quality as any other Dixit game. You might have some personal preferences about the art of one over another. I deem Journey just as an expansion, nothing more.

But remember, the game is fun and excites your brain into work.

Dixit es un juego muy simple, pero que posee una riqueza superior a muchos party-games o fillers, es estupendo con cualquier tipo de gente.

No puede faltar en ninguna colección, realmente excepcional.

A mi parecer, esta versión es la que posee las mejores ilustraciones, pero hay gente que prefiere las ilustraciones más sencillas de otras versiones, en esto es cosa de gustos.

Evidentemente el juego se va quemando con el tiempo, sobre todo para quien lo juego siempre (El dueño del juego), porque son las mismas ilustraciones todo el tiempo, pero aún así se disfruta, y la solución es complementarlo con otras de sus versiones para dar variedad.

While the pawns are far less interesting than rabbits, I do find myself generally enjoying the artwork of Journey more than Dixit (I've not played Odyssey myself to know where I stand on that).  It's the same game besides that though, which means it's some sort of brilliant, really.

RATING: 9
This game has gone over extremely well with non gamers. It is my go-to game at family gatherings. Everyone laughs and has a great time. It's an excellent breakaway from Apples to Apples. I usually tell everyone it's like Apples to Apples but with pictures! I wouldn't play with less than 4 though. Not so good with 3. Still, it's an outstanding game to have in your collection.

P.S I never win, but I don't mind. I'm giving it a bonus 0.1 for fun without winning factor :)

Update: I won a game eventually. I like the fact that winning is almost irrelevant to the level of fun you're having.

RATING: 7.5
The game is a nice light filler, bonus points for testing players creativity without overwhelming the average person.

Not too long, but possibly right on the edge of being too long.  My biggest concern is its vulnerability to over-play and long-term replay value.  Will the fun and enjoyment drop off noticeably at some point?

btw: three-player wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  It's worth trying if you enjoy the game and can't get those players necessary to get it into the four-plus range. Three-player isn't nearly as good as the 4-7 player range, but Dixit holds up.

LBeautiful and wonderful little game.  Quite nice.  

Horribly broken ... by its beautiful and wonderfulness.

Explain: Adults playing with children (100% of the time) can read any subtle (or not so subtle) reactions to the beautiful artwork and are able to instantly deduce which card was played by what player.  Then the game is the parent playing nice, pretending not to know = broken game.

Maybe older kids can keep a better poker face and not be so obvious.

But then the trouble is how horribly subjective everything is. 

And it gets very repetitive, people begin to see the same cards over and over again.

This was kind of a surprise how much I enjoyed it. I don’t typically like party games but this has been enjoyable so far. There’s some thinking and creativity and it plays relatively quickly. Everyone likes the art on the cards. I think the biggest surprise is that our five-year twins can play and hold their own in it. When they said they wanted to play it, I told them it would be too difficult. But when we played since we were trying to get them to guess our card, we weren’t using clues they wouldn’t understand and the game adjusted to their level even though we didn’t consciously try to. We are already looking forward to new cards.

More of a good thing can't be bad.  Dixit Journey is just that, but I like the artwork on these cards even more than cards from the original game.

NOTE: The promo cards from BGG go much better with this set than they do the original cards.  Original cards look like water color paintings, cards in this set look like oil paintings. Very crisp, almost animated in some cases.

More awesome Dixit goodness. The new art is spectacular, although if I had to choose I guess I would slightly prefer the older more "dreamlike" art.

Yet another superb game which finds its way onto the table at parties and Christmas. You each have a card with an elaborate and beautifully designed image on it, and a lead player must say something about a card in their hand that the other player then follow suit with to play their cards. The table then places bets on which card belongs to the original player and scoring occurs based on voting results.

Dixit is a really fun game that is difficult to explain without playing it.  Its very artsy and forces the players to, not only interpret the art on their cards, BUT to guess how the other players will or will not interpret it based on your clues.  Each game of Dixit will change depending on your cards, your frame of mind, and the players you play with.  This is my first game of Dixit, so I can't compare it to the other versions, but I really enjoyed this and will probably buy expansion cards in the future.

Look at that...ANOTHER DIXIT!  What sets this one apart from the others is the art.  Almost every card is stylized and attractive. It also is a stand alone game. It's like an Americanized version of the original. I steered clear of it because I already own Dixit why would I NEED another board or voting tokens or pieces? Then I saw the box and looked at the art....I HAD to own it and am glad I made the purchase. I grabbed all teh cards, left the rest and added them to my original Dixit collection

RATING: 8
The first few times I played this one I hated it. Now I love it!  I seriously avoided this game like the plague for over a year before finally giving it a second chance. This game can be a bit dependent on a couple factors: player number and player creativity.  As far as the player count is concerned, don't play with three players.  It's not even worth it. I think that the game really shines with six but five works great as well. The second factor is not a huge deal but a player who lacks any kind of a creative bone can make it really hard to play (at least when they give clues.)

Dixit is great because it can be played with both non-gamers and gamers alike and still be enjoyable.  I think it is the most accessible game I own for non-gamers.

Great social game that makes you think and the artwork is amazing! I want posters of at least half the cards.

RATING: 7
A sort of inverse Apples to Apples. Players still choose the card they think best fits, but so does the player whose turn it is. Everyone else tries to guess which of cards is the active player's, after that player comes up with a verbal clue, anything from a song lyric, movie quote, book title, or any random choice of words. He could even hum a tune. This clue is based on his interpretation of one of the beautifully, fantastically illustrated cards in his hand.

Anyone who has trouble placing or coming up with such cues will probably not enjoy this game so much, unless they have at least one other player who understands how they think.

I highly recommend this as a party game for creative individuals. The expansions make replay all the better.

Fun game that you can teach in 5 minutes.  Impressive how such a simple game can be so entertaining.  The biggest flaw in this game is that it needs more cards.  After a couple plays you have seen all the cards and make the same connections with the artwork if you are playing with the same group.  Or worse...  you are playing with some of the same group so you can give the same clues for your card and you are guaranteed to have at least one person pick it.

We just put all the cards together with the standard Dixit.  I treat this like it is an expansion because of that.  HOWEVER:  The score board from this edition is the one we use.  It makes game playing easier to manage.  We use the wooden bunnies for score markers from the original Dixit.

More Dixit goodness!  The artist is different from the first few sets of Dixit cards, and while I think I like the art a little better, it also seems like it may be a little less vague with less going on.  But this is still a worthy member of the Dixit family.  I wish this took more than 6 players (Odyssey allows for 10), but you can always use this game's cards with other Dixit games.

I now own all of the versions of Dixit and I am only slightly disappointed with Dixit Journey.  It's still a great game but the artwork is not as whimsical as the previous editions.

Overall it's still a great game.

The reason this gets such a higher rating than the original Dixit is because of they changed the artist in this version. The card art seems more crisp and detailed. Still just as wacky, but I love it!

One negative, they removed the bunny meeples and replaced them with plastic pawns. Kind of took away that whimsical nature a bit.

:thumbsup: fantastic illustrations

The optimal strategy is to either give a targeted inside-reference to a friend, or give a random clue that has nothing to do with the card you play, so that it's impossible for [i]all[/i] of your opponents to choose your card. To counter this, your opponents' best play is to do the same thing, effectively making Dixit completely broken or random. Is this strategy against the "spirit of the game?" I don't care. Any rules implemented to disable this strategy are unenforceable.

The cards in this game could be used for an interesting variant of Codenames: Pictures

Great game, but my only problem is I find you can't play it to many times, to frequently with the same people. I love the idea, but once everyone has seen the cards once they get a little deflated though the words used to describe things do get more abstract…in a good way. expansions help it, but there just isn't the replay amongst same friends as opposed to other games.

RATING: 4.25
Dixit feels to me like it'd be best played with a group of random people. Knowing other people opens up the easy out of inside jokes and such that just make the game dull.

I don't like having to try to turn off competitiveness for a game. It's not a bad game by any means, but it's just not my kind of game.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (May 2013)

I was wary of trying this because I have read many times that the art of the game was regular. I’m glad I bought it as the art is excellent. 

It is the same old good Dixit but with 81 cards with new art (It comes with a card from Dixit, Dixit quest and Dixit Odyssey for a total of 84 cards), that alone makes it a must buy for me. I would have preferred to buy only the cards (Dixit 3) and not the complete game which is redundant if you have Dixit or Odyssey. I heard they sold Dixit 3 in Europe only.

If you like Dixit you will like Dixit Journey, a great party game that has never let me down in any circumstance. I think I will be playing this for years to come.

Decent game. A lot like Apples to Apples, but with art.
One player will pick a card in his hand, and then try to describe it in such a way so that some people, but not all will guess what card it is. Once they have described their card, they will put it face down, and every other player will choose a card in their hand that they think matches the description. Once they have done that, the cards will be shuffled and turned over, and the players will each votes on the one they think the judge played.

The game is a bit dry, and can require some imagination, so it is better suited less-serious players with an artsy personality. The artwork on the cards is magnificent... only wish there were more than 80.

My issue with Dixit is that it's not what I want it to be.

Large player count, whimsical art, and simple rules screams to be pulled out with a casual group at a party or something.

Instead you get:
- A bunch of in-jokes that can isolate people from the game
- People spending all their time waiting for their turn thinking of a clue
- No real laughter or fun except mocking the person for their terrible clue which isn't fun for the cluemaker

I liked this game at first, but the more I played it, the more I realised that it was actually just rather dull. I'd much rather pull out a game like Concept, or The Resistance, or Codenames, or Spyfall, or Panic on Wall Street or especially Monikers.

Dixit just fails to live up to what I would expect from it, and I've since acquired many games that I think fit the same crowd dynamics in a far more fun and engaging way for everybody.

RATING: 5
Simply put, the artwork is not as good as in the previous sets. There was a childish naivete in the style of Marie Cardouats paintings that made the images feel like they were the dreams (and sometimes, nightmares) of children, and Piero's cards in Dixit Odyssey emulated this mostly with success. However, Xavier Collete's cartoony style is too practiced, and the paintings feel less like they are from the minds of children, and more like they are for the minds of children. 

The whole game feels like a dumbed-down version (if that's even possible) made for mass-sale at Wal-Mart - the 7-12 player rules from Dixit Journey are gone, and we're back to the voting tiles from the first Dixit. The scoring track is hideous, with fully one half of it dedicated to explaining the scoring system. This frustrates me because I've had no problem memorizing the scoring system without this (there's only three ways to score points), and really, if players needed reminding, a card-sized player-aid would have sufficed. The images on the cards also seem too obviously inspired by real people, places, and pop-culture. This means that the likelihood of players giving clues in the form of a description of the mood or feeling evoked is reduced, while the likelihood is increased that play revolves around inventing sufficiently obscure references to, say, Mount Rushmore. As a consequence, the chances that someone will be able to play a card that will distract others is significantly diminished, and players who choose the wrong card will do so simply because they didn't understand the clue and had to make a random guess.

Unless you desperately want more Dixit, avoid. Either of the previous two boxed games make a better entry point.

This game would easily be a nine in my book, except that it does not play well with mixed groups. A group of 7 year olds can play it easily, as can a group of 40 year olds, but mix the two and it becomes a far worse game. Everyone has to be the same basic place in life and that makes it a lower rating, but a good game of this is fantastic.

This is a very abstract game so it's hard to define in concrete terms, but imagine that you're an artist applying captions to your paintings for a museum. If your caption is too obvious for the painting, the viewer will be uninterested and think less of your work. If your caption is too vague though, the viewer likewise won't "get it". Your goal is to get a healthy mix of the two reactions for your paintings.

Dixit: Journey is the most unique and beautiful game in my collection.  the entire game is largely baed on each persons individual response to unusual imagery.  There is no strategy, no player elimination, just a "journey" of image and response, limited only by the players imaginations.  This is a great alternative board game especially for those who do not necessarily excel at logic or strategy games, but are good storytellers or image-makers.  The only reason this game does not score a 10 is because it's replayability may be limited.  After seeing a card several times, it is hard not to draw or get trapped in previous responses.  This is helped by having a very large pile of the wonderful cards, but the "expansions" are almost as expensive as the games themselves.  All that aside, this is a wonderful alternative to the "typical" party and strategy games and a favorite of my family's.  My kids love it, too.

Great party game. I personally enjoy playing to see what people come up with, but it can be a bit competitive too. Where this game lacks is using it as an ice breaker. This game definitely works better as a game for people who already know each other pretty well. The mechanics alone suggest that the people sitting at the table should use "inside" clues. The Artwork is fantastic and there are plenty of expansions to keep this interesting.

Great fun the first couple plays but can get old real fast. To combat this you need to either buy more Dixit sets or find some interesting off-the-wall people to play with. 

Each player always holds 6 cards and everyone is playing one per turn so you see everything, even in large Dixit decks, pretty quickly.

First I thought it'd be great to play with kids, but so far they seem to have a hard time giving good clues. Theirs are usually too obvious. Kids are great at throwing great contender cards into the fray though.

Totally did not live up to the hype for me...although the game was played under less than ideal conditions.  This was the boardgame disappointment of the year for me in 2016.

We only had 4-5 players, and it feels like this game would be more engaging if there were 7 or 8 players participating.

We also had lots of distractions on both occasions we played - with people walking away from the table to attend to kids, etc.  

Overall, this was a frustrating experience...

Dixit is generally a great game, probably a 9. The artwork in Dixit: Journey is a step down from the original; not necessarily in art quality, but the actual images themselves lack the surreal imagination of the original and are a bit harder to work with. However, Journey partially makes up for it by doing away with the annoying rabbit board of the original and using a much more straightforward scoring board.

At first glance my thoughts on Dixit Journey were: Cheap components. The hollow plastic pawns drift around the board at the slightest bump. The most important part of the game, the cards, aren't given any kind of coating to protect them from normal wear during gameplay. Also, the cards are too large for conventional shuffling making them even more likely to get damaged.

The game itself is elegant in its simplicity. Although dependent on the cards, which remain unchanging, the mechanic focuses on what the players see in each image making the game a Rorschach test of those playing.

When compared with other iterations of Dixit, I would say this one's artwork theme could be described as Tim Burton-esque, so don't offer that as a clue! I liked the original Dixit box that had no board, but integrated the victory track into the box itself far better than Journey's pointless gameboard. Plus, the rabbits from the first game had far more theme than Journey's cheap, characterless pawns.

One point less than regular Dixit because my copy came with ugly plastic pawns rather than cute bunnies. (I guess later printings correct this, but that doesn't help me.) I'll have to pick up a copy of regular Dixit to rectify my bunny situation.

Good game with the right group.

It is just another dixit version, but with two or three good things to have in mind:

-The boxing is very good and has enough space to put 4 dixit card sets. Even foiled cards fits.
-The "art" is, in my opinion, better than in Dixit 2 and Dixit.
-As it brings a board and some few nice tokens it is easier to introduce it to new players.

Dixit is one of my favorite board-non board games. Its 8.5 for me as I realy liked it.

Use a phrase or word to describe an illustration on one of your 6 cards.  But don't be obtuse! If nobody votes for your card, you earn no points!  But don't be obvious! If everyone votes for your card you get no points, and everyone else gets two points!  And if we are not voting  for a card you named, then try to fool other people into voting for your card to earn a point...  A stunning looking game and a very unusual game mechanic.

Dixit expansions and additions don't usually provide much opportunity for commentary, since they never do more than add new cards. But Dixit: Journey does deserve some mention for the nice production. The board is very useful for remembering the scoring, and the insert manages to hold what's in the box and what can be added from several expansions. The only downside is that the illustrations are just a bit less abstract, which is more a preference issue. Still, a great game.

RATING: 7.25
Like Apples to Apples, but there is a storyteller each round who plays a card face down and can say anything they want to about it.  Then, each other player tries to play a card face down that they think most closely matches what the storyteller said.  If the clue is too obvious and everyone picks it, the storyteller gets no points.  Points are given to anyone who can get other players to pick their card.  Now, the absolute best part of the game is the amazing surreal artwork on each card.  In all honesty, sometimes I just pull this out just to look at the art.  It's that good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another great set of cards that adds to Dixit's replayability. I don't like the plastic pieces nearly as much as the wooden rabbits in the original, but I do like the smaller scoring track (even though it's not as pretty). Pretty much the only thing this adds is cards if you have the original, but that's just about all you need. I may have preferred to get the edition with just cards and no other components, though, since this one costs a bit much just to add some cards to the deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Really liked this a lot when we first got it, but I'm not as excited to play it anymore, I definitely prefer something with more strategy. There's for sure a time and a place for it though, and I'd never get rid of it - it fills a certain niche perfectly

This, and all other similar Apples to Apples variants are all plagued by one issue: limited variety. The first playthrough of this game will be extremely fun - all the cards are new to you and you will have a blast making jokes about them. The problem is, once you see every single card at least once (which will happen within 2 games), your interest and "fun" factor for the game immediately drops. The game will feel suddenly boring as you lose the feeling of discovering new cards.

You can easily see the publisher take advantage of this, there are many empty slots in the box that are meant for the purchase of other expansions (which is literally just more pictures to play with). Once you see all the expansions, the same thing happens. You get extremely uninterested.

Easy to learn and play.  Great game for children and nongamers.  Plays similar to Apples to Apples except with pictures.  Same scoring mechanism as original game; however, different score board which is easier to use and clearer.  This version also has different cards than the original.  Game components excellent - thick cardboard score board and durable cards with very nice artwork.  Game time is about 1 hour which feels right.

This game was done in a sort of annoying way. Advertised as having 84 new cards, but the American edition only had 81 new cards, plus three cards with art from other Dixit games. ALSO, the European edition had a few (two?) extra cards that the American version did not have.

You hear about some sets being "misprinted" and missing cards. According to the publisher that was only the European "Dixit 3" edition, some printings of which were missing the two extra cards.

If you want a full set of 84 cards that doesn't overlap the other sets, buy the set of "2012 Asmodee Special Cards" from the BGG Store -- two of these are the "missing" cards from Dixit Journey. The card showing the Tree with the harp in it is shown in the rules (and the box cover) for Dixit Journey; and the "flying" card is the cover art from the European "Dixit 3" set.

The Dragon promo card is the intended 84th original card. You'll note that it appears on the box cover.

Just like Dixit, only more-so. This time there's a new art style, and it is completely different, and just as captivating. The aesthetic is even more to my taste than the previous aesthetic, but all of the sets I encountered are gorgeous. Odyssey has my favorite voting system--a system scalable up to 12 players--whereas Dixit has my favorite player pieces as they can be either squirrels or bunnies (repeated in Journey). I wish Journey and Dixit had different player colors so that customers who own both sets in order to get ahold of more cards could mix-and-match pieces better between sets. As it stands, I have a lot of same-colored bunnies. Here's my review of Dixit:

I typically describe this game to friends a Apples to Apples with French surrealist artwork. While it isn't necessarily the best description of the game, it tends to get people on board quickly.

Like Apples to Apples this is a game about knowing the people you play with. It has a slightly more complicated scoring system that, in practice, creates a nice tension between making clues too difficult and too easy. There's a sense of creative license here that simply isn't found in Apples to Apples and is found to a still-lesser extent in Cards Against Humanity. And it's that combination of solid, tested party-game mechanics with creative spice that makes this game so brilliant at the table.

I feel like this game is deserving of a ten. The artwork alone makes me think I'll always enjoy leafing through the cards ... we'll see how I feel in a half-year or so.

This game is pretty clever.  Light enough that it could be viewed as a party game, although it only plays 6, but also deep enough that it considers a little thought.  The trick is, as the active player, to give clues that are vague enough that not everyone guesses your card, but are also good enough that at least somebody does.  Then as the "guesser" you need to play the card that will be guessed over the active player.  Of course easier said then done...

More cards for Dixit, which is awesome, but one begins to feel like they're being charged through the nose for a few extra pieces of awesome art. Then one shuts up and plays more Dixit, and forgets all about that. At least this one is an expandalone, so you don't *need* the other sets.

RATING: 4
Like Cards Against Humanity, there doesn't seem to be much replayability. Once you've seen all of the cards then future plays aren't as fun, and the gameplay isn't all that interesting to begin with.

Update: Another issue with the game is that your best move can sometimes be really unfun for most of the group. For instance, in a recent game I gave a clue that was basically an inside joke between myself and one of the players. Since the clue was essentially a made-up word for which the other players had no reference, they just had to hope to get some points completely at random.

There can also be an issue if there is a generation gap between some of the players, or if they have completely different knowledge backgrounds.

After more plays, I still don't see why this game is so appealing to so many gamers.

Dixit Journey doesn't do much different than other versions of Dixit. The main difference, and the main draw, is that it provides new artwork.

Overall, I think Journey is a little less impressive than the original game. It limits the number of players to cut down on costs. And they got rid of the peg and board selection method, presumably to also cut costs. And the neat wooden bunnies have been replaced by hollow plastic pawns. The artwork, while very good, doesn't quite appeal to me as much as the art from the original game. But Dixit is a game that grows stale after you've seen the same art over and over again, so Journey does exactly what is needed by introducing something different. Unfortunately after two or three plays, I'll be right back to being bored by the new art.

The idea of this game is just brilliant. Very unique party game that has been a hit basically every time. This is also one of those few games that i can easily play with my parents. The only problem with this game is that after a while the cards can get a bit "samey" (expansions help this) and at the start my group played this so much that recently it has been a bit hard to get it on the table. Another problem can be that some people just don't like it because they don't like to give clues/they are bad at it. With these people you should just let them pass the storytelling part.

This game really comes through when you need a game for a double date that is friendly, cute, and easy to explain (esp. when even sushi-go is too complicated). Newcomers will love their first look through the card art. Once you've been through the deck, things get a little stale. However, you also get better at giving clues only your spouse will guess correctly.

This one gets high marks for the art.  The game play is a bit more "party game" like, being in the same vein as Balderdash and Apples to Apples (both of which I also like), but the imaginative and beautiful artwork elevates it ahead of those.  Always fun to play with new players just so you can see them experience the cards for the first time.

I think this is either the type of game that you love or you hate.  Personally, I love trying to figure out just the right clue to coax 1 or 2 other people to pick my card, as well as the challenge of picking a card to try and match the other player's clues.  So simple that it's easy to play with non-gamers, but interesting enough to keep gamers interested.

All variations of Dixit are the same good party game. Good with creative fun people.

I always change the rules to give you 1 point per person who guessed correctly (while keeping that if everyone guessing it then 0 points) otherwise its too tempting to tailor your clue to the person you know best keeping it completely impossible for everyone else.

Love. This. Game. As a creative person, this game provides a wonderful outlet for creativity in a board game. I was never a fan of Pictionary, as my artwork is terrible. So naturally, the ability to get rid of that portion of the game, and utilize the beautiful artwork of the Dixit series to describe your clue is excellent. Really light, really fun, and a great game for all types of people. Real winner for me.

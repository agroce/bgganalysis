RATING: 8
Very cool and simple flight combat game. Plays in about 30 to 60 minutes depending on the optional rules you add in and the number of players.

I think the game captures the essence of air battles perfectly!

Fun, fast and seems to simulate aerial combat pretty well. Sometimes the game gets a little repetitive, and I worry about its longterm depth. But as a fast game to fill time, it's excellent.

First playing and I liked it quite a bit. Components are classy and the game play is fluid. More playings and my opinion hasn't changed. It's a fun WWI flying game. Well done!

I see it as the precursor to X-wing and Armada. It's a solid system that now seems kind of quaint in comparison to its fancy descendants.

RATING: 6.5
I have lowered this from an 8 to a 6.5 after repeated plays, basically for the same reasons given by Tim Benjamin above.  However I still like this as a multiplayer game that is simple, tense, exciting.  The first FAST dogfighting game that I know of.  No dice rolling, energy computions, or complex damage charts.  Everything is handled quickly with cards.  Just make your move and fire your guns.  Best played with team squadrons, where each player flies his own plane.  It is a little thin for just two players flying one plane each (in fact in this case I would only rate it about 5.5)  I prefer to play this as a game of pure maneuver, and don't use the damage cards...if you are acquired five (or any agreed upon number of) times as a target you are shot down (close range acquisitions count double).

Not a bad game... a highly-oversimplified combat flight simulation mixed with a little Roborally. Certainly not the best game, but hardly the worst either. It's a novel approach to an arena that is done VERY well in the computerized world, as opposed to the boardgame/cardgame arena.

First game.  I like planning the 3 moves and seeing what your opponent does.  I think I'll get better at that as time goes on.  It will also take some time to see which planes should fight against which others, to make a fair game.  Very enjoyable, though!

Totally fast fun. I love the way it feels like you're actually flying around a field shooting at each other in WW I. I recommended it - albeit a bit pricey it you go for all the miniatures - which you definitely should! The FFG base game is a complete rip off. Don't bother with it. Get the miniatures. Get the play mat (it's a beauty). And set your mind for a very fast miniatures game.

Quick and a good game! WoW is interesting and still simple, perhaps this is just the thing for weekends at the cottage... :) I also own the Barker Sopwith Camel and von Richtofen Fokker Dr I minis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice simple and fun game.  It plays a bit like a simplified Sea-Strike in that you manoeuvre in the same way and play cards for damage - some of which can cause your weapons to jam or can result in an automatic kill.
The rules are simple (wisely not including height variations) and it's a blast to play.  It would be great if future expansions were to include Zeppelin busting and ground attacks, and I don't think that would be too hard to do in a very simple way.  My score may well rise on repeated playing.

Excelent (filler and easy to teach) game! I needed a game where the rules can easilly be explained and where the playing time would be fairly short. This game offers exactly that. But it still requires tactical skill as the planes dance with eachother, trying to get in position for a perfect shot.

RATING: 7
Fun,light ariel game. One fault I do have with this product is that you cannot play all the planes that come in this set without buying the Watch Your Back set. The reason is some planes use the "B" damage deck and this product only has the "A" damage deck.

RATING: 10
Played this for the first time a few weeks ago with my wife and 8 yr old daughter.  My wife asked to add in all the optional rules next time and my daughter asked if she could fly two planes instead of one.  

I was hoping for a game with good playability, some historical flavor, and that would be a good introductory game for both my wife and daughter.  Based on their responses, I couldn't ask for anymore from this game.

As a bonus, we played using Wings of War and Wings of Glory miniatures and Wings of Glory playing mats.  It was fun, the rules were easy to understand (with the exception of the red/green guns jammed indicator on the damage cards - which was figured out online later), and we all wanted to play again.  Excellent game.

I used to play and love Blue Max back in the day (yes I'm that old) and that's what initially attracted me to this game. Wings of War is different than the old Blue Max, and it's better! It's a great game if this sort of stuff blows your hair back. I prefer the WWI versions to the others, but that's just my personal preference. Recommended!

RATING: 6
Reasonably fun game without a whole lot of thought to it but enjoyable nonetheless. Don't play with one plane per player unless you play with more than two players (and use teams). The game can drag a bit with new players as they struggle to find the maneuvers that will get them into position. The optional damage rules usually bring about a quicker ending. 

My complaint with this game is that it can get kind of boring after a while. It comes down to guessing correctly in many instances. If you guess what your opponent is going to do then something interesting happens but if you don't you end up spending the next 4 turns just trying to get back into position.

RATING: 8
The grand-daddy of X-Wing. This is a great idea, great theme, and fantastic minis. Let down slightly by clumsily trying to move via-cards, but it is still a great mechanic when combined with the 3-card plan ahead stage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great fun. Must choose carefully the playing surface: too big and many turns will be spent just to get an enemy plane in the firing range, too small and everyone will be flying in circles or in straight lines with plenty of Immelmanns. Also, while its playable sharing manoeuvre's decks, it's much better with a deck for each player, thus limiting a bit planes choices.

Wings of War. The Original. A must have for any fans of flying games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game mechanics are great. Fast, simple, and virtually no learning curve to    have a great experience playing. You can pick up the mechanics in a matter of minutes, and the replay value of it is wonderful so long as you aren't a hardcore fan of games that go extremely in depth (i.e. ammo count, fuel count, etc.). Even if you are, however, you can quite easily draw up some house rules to suit your needs. I highly recommend this game, at the very least to try, for any fan of aerial combat games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Like all Wings of War boxes... full of game-y goodness!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
This is a game that seems much better in theory than in practice.  You are the pilot of a WWI fighter plane and you can choose from a large variety of different planes.  You maneuver around the open battlefield (table) trying to get a shot at your opponents, while avoiding shots on you.  While this seems like a fun maneuvering game, there is very little strategy or tactics and mostly luck.

Cons:  Planes are too similar.  Other than their outward appearance, planes are nearly identical.  Some may have slightly sharper turns than others while traveling slower, but in general, the deck you use doesnt really affect your strategy.

The Damage deck is terrible, having you draw a card each time you are hit.  Cards range from 0-3 damage, which a majority  of the cards being 0's and some being instant death.  This means that you could take 10 hits with only a few damage, or you could take 3 hits and be completely destroyed.

Pros:  This game scales extraordinarily well by player numbers.  You could play with a virtually infinite number of players without much downtime (since you can all move simultaneously).

It's miniatures gaming with out the minatures.  The card stock is thin plastic, which looks like it will hold up for a long time.  The box it came in looks like it was designed by a monkey...  Good graphics, poor layout.

The game play itself is quite interesting and quite challenging as you fight for position (and control) of your own plane.  This one is a game which will take some time to master!

I'm a pilot and I work with pilots.  Pulling out WoW at lunchtime is always a hit.  A one on one dogfight quickly turns into a classic turning battle which becomes unfun before long, so the more planes on the table the better.

{2 plays, 4 player partnership} I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one, even though I was killed with 3 hits my first game (5, 4, and 4!).  Second game was more fun, and not just because I wasn't destroyed right away.. but knowing the various card decks - yours and your opponents - really helps.  It's tough to outmaneuver or doublethink your enemy if you have NO idea what he's capable of.

RATING: 5
Pretty fun game. Specially when it's two o'clock in the morning and you're too burnt out to play anything that requires more than 0.5% of your brain capacity.
It gets much better with the airplane minis, which are very well done.
This game is classified here as both a card game and a wargame. I don't think it's neither.

RATING: 8
See WoW - Burning Drachens.

Where Burning Drachens allows you to get away with flying one plane per side in a two player game because there's so much other stuff involved - gun emplacements, primarily - you can get away with flying one plane per side, since those scenarios normally aren't out-and-out dogfights. If you're playing straight-up Famous Aces, I strongly suggest y'all play with two planes per player. It gives you more to do in the planning phase, adds some tactical depth to gameplay, and drastically reduces the tedious looping and weaving required to set up a good shot when you only have one aircraft. (People say "well, that's what it was like in real life," but nobody said those guys were having fun, either.)

Famous Aces receives a score one half point lower than Burning Drachens only because BD included so many neat additions, and FA is a little Plane Jane in comparison.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast and simple game. I love the way the movement cards aproximate the actual perfomance of the planes they are supposed to simulate. Additionally the game is just fun to play. A lot of the game is trying to guess where your opponent will move and respond accordingly.

This is a really fun game.  Luck is a factor, which may bother some (if so either remove the explosion, or play with multiple planes).  I enjoy the planes in this box slightly more than the ones in Watch Your Back, but either set (or both!) makes for a fun light game.

Creative use of cards to recreate a WWI air battle.  The movement decks capture the elements that make the planes unique.  Plays well with various numbers of players.  Game scenarios are quick.  Lots of possibilities for expansions and adaptations.  Nice system.  It would be neat to see a campaign book put together with a series of scenarios that allow players to create a pilot and try to get Ace status.  Hmm... maybe I should work on that...

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play.  A light fun game that creates a lot of table talk.  Not for the overly analytical.  Unlike many wargames, a game that remains balanced with three players with one person taking 2 planes and the 2 players on the other side taking one plane each.  Good production values, and great artwork for the aircraft.  To me the fun during the playing of this game is much more important than who wins in the end.  For more details please read my review of this game.  

Plays well with 2-4.

Sopwith, but fiddly.  You need a higher plane count to make it interesting, but the fiddliness bogs down with many planes.
After some repeated play the fiddliness seems to reduce a bit.  Still, this would be better served by hexes, like Sopwith.  Adding the randomized damage model and per plane-type maneuvers to Sopwith would be better.  This sounds alot like Blue Max...which I suppose I should try to get off of ebay.

Reading all the comments and the reviews, this sounds like a very fun game that can scale up to at least 6 players.  Although, I have to purchase two sets and I don't know which ones yet.

This won't work for my couples group since there is player elimination.  People would end up waiting when they get eliminated early.

Initial Play: 6-1-2007
This is a fun game.  It reminds me of Roborally because you pre-program your plane 3 movements ahead.  You try to out guess what your opponents will do so you can position yourself very well.  Also, unlike Roborally, your cards are never random.  You always have the same set of maneuver cards to use per turn.  This minimizes the luck considerably.  The game is nice and quick and is very easy to teach.  There is a learning curve somewhat as you try to get familiar with what kind of maneuver cards you have with your plane.  I really like this game.  I think this is definitely a buy.  Will see if I can try to play with the minis first.

RATING: 8
Initial Impressions: This is a fun tactical game which captures the feel of aerial dogfighting in WWI. The planes each have their own characteristics, such as maneuvering limitations and structural points. Optional rules for elevation and damage can be added as players become more experienced. A simple game to teach, the real fun becomes outguessing your opponents maneuvers and surviving long enough to exploit them.

10 Plays: I'm still enjoying this game but not playing nearly as frequently as I'd like. Although the 1v1 dogfights are fun, I'm finding that multi-plane fights are even more fun. I have yet to play with altitude rules and have only begun to experiment with ground units. I think I'll try some solitaire sessions to become familiar with the planes' capabilities.

20 Plays: We've just started playing with altitude rules, as well as varied missions. Although they add more complexity to the game, I find that altitude rules are essential for maintaining balance between heavier planes that pack more punch and lighter, nimbler planes. Given the choice I will opt for including altitude rules every time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

a nice system makes a fluent and original game. After ten minutes of playing it was a fantastic game, but when two planes couldn't catch each other easily, it became a bit boring. So the rating goes from brilliant to good.

Robo Rally in flying crates, or a Nova battle book game without endless page-flicking. What took 'em so long? Very inviting artwork, simple mechanics, secret simultaneous action selection, interesting play. There aren't many wargames that my partner will sit down for, but this one looked good to her even before I tried my most persuasive tricks. A miniature game without miniatures, or a dogfight without altitude. It really should not work as a card game, but somehow it does. This is a blast.

The rulebook wasn't as clear as it could have been, the "instant kill" card got removed without thinking twice, and some of the optional rule are really needed to bring the game alive. The handicap rules for aggravated hits could be clearer, but we made them work, and once you spend three quarters of a game pulling a damaged plane out of its constant nosedives, who cares if you've got them right!

It is obvious the game screams out for expansions, more manoeuvres, more planes, optional rules, cool miniatures, and altitude rules. It is equally obvious this is exactly the sort of game that will find a willing flock to be milked for all they are worth. The basics are rock-solid, or is that air-tight?

On its own it can be a bit repetitive, even more so if you are playing with one plane each. They could have included two more basic manoeuvre decks to fill the table up for a real dogfight feast, without having to shell out for the duplicate boxes, expansions and extra decks, but I guess that is successful marketing for you. On the other hand, even with just 2 planes each this is a great way to sample its potential, and few will need more encouragement to dive in and build from there. This game will get better as more expansions are added.

The rating is for the basic set only. The potential of the system is closer to a 9. If this was going head to head with "Watch Your Back" I would prefer the latter by a whisker as the variety of planes in that set is more distinct. However, as this was the original introduction to the system, my rating for this one as a stand-alone release just gets the better of its twin. I do feel both sets should have been released in a single box right away, as only by combining the two sets do you get a whole game that offers all the variety needed for enjoyable repeat plays, instead of a skirmish taster that quickly gets repetitive without additional sets.    

I wish they had used the back sides of the flying crates cards for duplicate images of other machines, so you could keep an identical copy of your plane on your battle board, and I also wished they had found a clearer way to distinguish the manoeuvre cards than just using a letter. It's easy to get them mixed up in large battles when you control multiple machines, as they all look so similar. It wouldn't be the first time I pull off a K-Deck escape with my A-plane. But these are small niggles and easily forgiven.

A fun game and cheap compared to its more complicated offspring like the X-Wing Miniatures game.  If you're wondering if you'll like the X-Wing game, you might want to give this a play and see how you like the general system before investing hundreds of dollars in X-Wing miniatures.

Great dogfight game---controlling your little plane is a lot harder than you think, and is a little like learning how to drive.  I've only played this two-player, but I can imagine the fun and chaos that can be had with four.  You can definitely get skilled enough at this game to be the Red Baron of the cardstock set.

One playing, with 3.  At first glance, a nice simple system, seems to capture pretty well the dogfight and historical feel.  Long term may not hold my interest, but really nicely placed to appeal to my 11 year old son (especially with the minis, which are visually very good).

Great bridge to a miniatures feel using cards.  Production is top notch. Play is quick and does not require more than round table, and immerses you in the feel of a dogfight.

By itself, the game isn't bad...  but I can't appreciate the mechanic of bumping a card one way or another and essentially winning because of it.  It's almost like you have to, or end up inadvertently, cheating at it.  It would make a great turn-based videogame though.

It really needs a referee.

All that said, do I enjoy it?  Yeah.  I just need to make sure I don't sneeze.

WoW is easy to learn and play. The authors manage to hide the complexity of the capabilities of the planes in their Maneuver Deck, which is nice. In this way, inexperienced gamers can just go for the fun. Veterans will try to find the hidden capabilities and push their plane to the limit.
While vaguely reminiscent of other airplane combat game, still improves on the qualities of each of them.

Surprisingly fun WWI dogfight game. Players plot their moves using cards (three at a time like Robo-Rally) representing flight paths, choosing from tailored decks that represent the manoeuvres each individual plane was capable of. If a plane has a shot (using measurements within firing arcs), the opponent takes one or two damage cards depending on the range. The damage cards are random numbers which are collected until the total damage equals the plane's damage factor at which point it is considered shot down. Special icons are also on the cards to represent special types of damage that may limit what the plane can do (fire, jammed guns, engine or control damage).

The game can be played in several ways - two player duels with one or more planes each or in teams of almost any number desired. There are lots of expansions to add extra interest in terms of missions (ballon busting, photo-recce, etc.) and more planes!

Small miniatures are also available to add spice - which also allow for variable altitude representation for extra realism. Great little game!
++++++
The WWI version which is the most colorful and interesting in my view has been discontinued in favour of a WWII version that I don't find all that compelling. Odd. I'm glad I obtained a good variety of decks and models while they were available.

The game is easy to play but not so much interesting and a bit boring with just two planes. Rules are not so detailed to make a fight between just two aircrafts interesting. When played with 4 or more planes/players it's randomness makes the game funnier. Anyway if you want to play with more than four players you have to buy another copy or wait for the next expansion.

This is a very clever implementation of Ace of Aces
(essentially) in physical space. It suffers from the
same issues as the earlier game though (play limited
by number of books available). Use of cards hinders
number of planes that can be used. It also introduces
issues into the firing, by limiting how many of given
criticals can happen (especially important for engine 
hits - which CANNOT be doubled up, even though there
are rules for that).

All in all, Blue Max is a better game for anything other
than one on one duels at the same level of complexity.

I started playing Mustangs and Messerschmitts years ago, and about that same time I was introduced to Fighter pilot and other air to air games.  At the time I thought they were the best games out there...  Then along came Wings of War WW1 and then later WW2 by Nexus games.  Andrea Angiolino and his partner devised and put together an air war game like no other.  After playing it a couple times, I found the rules system simple and easy to learn.  All I needed to do was develop the "Eye" for figuring out where the airplane will end up when I plot it's movement.  That comes with experience.  Overall this is a very easy game to learn and play.  I love the pre-painted aircraft for the game, but sometimes I just cannot help myself and either repaint one or get an alternate source of aircraft and then paint it myself.  That is the model hobbyist in me.

Easy to learn. The model planes look very pretty. Minor quibbles: I'm not too keen on the collectability issue (I would want to play with 3 aeroplanes of the same type for instance which would require buying booster sets). Also one has to rely a great deal on the honesty of other players. There is a lot of scope for turning and moving cards to get into / out of range / arc of fire. Whilst I like the card system I would prefer to use hexes. Early elimination is also quite possible, particularly with some of the special effects on the damage cards.

There's just enough meat to be interesting.  The most attractive aspect is the degree to which all excess chrome, fluff, and other extraneous chaff has been be excised to leave pretty much as minimal a game as could be managed.  My refinement of Mike Chase's variant (see article) further improves that quality.  The surprising thing is that while the maneuver choices are essentially akin to blind bidding, that the impact cost of those decisions is low enough, the information level high enough, and the game short enough that what emerges is quite surprisingly and suspiciously deep fun.

My one playing of this game was quite fun and fairly quick. Others have mentioned the problem of there not being enough movement decks in the box, but this is an understandable decision on Nexus' part.  Play on a cloth surface, though.

"Ok" at best. The idea of the actual position of the cards on the table being the main mechanic of the game is nice but it's not as fun as it might seem - mostly due to the extra luck elements involved in the damage card draws (you can completely out-maneuver someone and still end up on the short end of the stick because the damage deck's extra events can be too significant - which robs the game of some of its enjoyment).

I've played this game a lot - partly due to being involved in organizing events for it back when I managed a game store. Every time I've played it, I felt like I was just going through the motions to be a good sport. This game just doesn't do it for me.

What fun.  Taught it to my sons aged nine and six and we played with no difficulty.  Played my wife, and we chased each other around and she riddled me with bullets.  Cool game mechanic.Cons: You're paying $20 for a tiny deck of cards on thin stock, with some overproduced game mats and a box.  I'm mounting my cards on mat board, something of carcassonne quality.  I have a desperate need to buy an expansion, but from a distance this game   an expansion shouldn't cost $40.  For that price you could get memoir '44.  This game on sale would be a perfect value.

update:

Famous Aces is a good game, but having more planes turns it into a great game.

I had Famous Aces over a year ago and my sons weren't too into it. I enjoyed the game, but  part of the problem was that one of them was too young, and our first game was on a playing space that was too large, so there was a lot of hunting and not a lot of shooting.  So I traded it.  

When the minis came out I bought Burning Drachens and then four, no five, no six miniatures and also bought the recon patrol deck.  Wow, what a difference!  Having all of those planes and incorporating the advanced damage makes for a much subtler game, as does choosing a playing field that matches the number of planes.  When playing with the minis, just *watching* the game is pretty fun, as a bunch of newbies all fly towards the center and start slugging it out.  I haven't even incorporated the artillery or other Drachens components yet.  The variations in the planes and beginning to read the historical background have made this a much richer game for me.  There were some amazing tales of gallantry and ruthlessness that came out of the war's aerial combat.

I have since printed off lots of game aids from the yahoo group and am waiting impatiently for additional miniatures.  Two seater planes with rear guns and the occasional flying tank like the Breuget change everything.  And I haven't even played with altitude rules yet!

By the way, my favorite line from WoW discussions on this board relates to the "explosion" card.  Someone wrote that they felt it was too lucky, and someone else responded, "I'm sure the real pilots in WWI didn't like exploding either."  Heh.

I look forward to playing a 16 plane dogfight at an upcoming convention!

Another update: the convention was a while ago.  The guy who told me to leave my Wings at home for the convention didn't bring his, and I haven't played it since.

I lump all three of the Wings of War games together (Famous Aces, Watch Your Back and Burning Drachens), as I generally mix them all into a game, whether it's a basic dogfight or balloon busting.  The basic rules are very easy to teach to new players which makes it very simple to add a number of the advanced flight rules into a second (follow-up) game.  The addition of miniatures makes the game very visually appealing and can usually elicit airplane noises from even the most serious of gamers, given the right mix of players, as laughter and moans ensue from the chaos of the game.  After a number of recent plays (with miniatures) I have changed my rating from 6 to 8.

Production: Nice artwork, and the arrows are surprisingly easy to utilize.  The game is basically a deck of cards and could have been packaged as such.  Play: A well-made game, with a good core system, but not my type of game.  I'd rather play a turn-based computer version, in which I can see my intended move simulated before I commit to it; like in Robo Rally, I found it very difficult to just figure out where I was flying to, and what direction I'd be facing, so trying to anticipate my opponent's move as well was just too much.  The rules need to be clearer as well.  The fun I had playing this game was more from the mirth it inspired in me (sound effects followed by shouts of "hard right!") than from the game mechanisms.  (2+0+1) (1 play)

A very simple yet fun game.  A gamer for over 45 years, thought this recommendation would be too silly.  But after a few very quick, 15-30 minute games,we were laughing and having a good time.  My 11 year old enjoys it also.   We look forward to playing it with our big group.  Have bought all 3 of the games and the miniature planes.   After 3 or 4 missions it was time to put it away and do something more serious.  A great appetizer though.

Wings of War does a great job of distilling air combat into a very fun, simple game system.  It is pretty lucky and with only a couple of people left things may drag out a bit.

Fun, fast, lite game.  The movement cards are brilliant, but not as clean playing as a hex based game.  The components are great, but pricey.  The rules are clear and easy to understand.  A very good buy, especially if you do not already own Blue Max or Ace of Aces.  One caveat: much like a miniatures game, this is not a game for sloppy players or cry-babies (which rules out most convention opponenets).

Prefer playing with the miniatures instead of cards for a couple of reasons: 1] They're miniatures! and 2] The card's stock isn't very durable. My plane card was starting to fray at the edges after only one play of the game.

I enjoy this game, but not enough to have as part of my collection.  The game suffers from endless expansions and collectibility.  There's significant luck involved with drawing damage cards, but not enough to make it unfun.  The mechanics of the game are brilliant and mimic what it seems a dogfight would be like.  Also, it's easy enough to explain and play in a fairly short amount of time.

Traded away for Hansa and Babel.

RATING: 8
You need to field more than one plane per side, however, otherwise you just chase each other around the table top. Cards skid and warp slightly. We have resolved the former element by using a wonderful Hotzmat depicting European fields, which really adds to the atmosphere. I treat this as a fun light game, and we're still only using the FA/WYB rules at present (i.e. no altitude) but have incorporated all the booster and set cards into our game. I am enjoying the game mechanics. Clearly, a lot of research has gone into making the manouver decks reflect a plane's attributes. Historical accuracy without the sweat.

This is my first impression after one 4 player game. I really enjoyed this quick and streamlined game.  The movement system works very well, and each plane performs differently.  The hidden damage is another nice feature - you're never quite sure how much more damage your opponent can take especially since some of the damage cards are 0 point cards.  I definitely prefer this game to Crimson Skies (although the CS models are really cool).

A bit thin and dry as a game if played with only one plane per side. However, it really comes alive when trying to co-ordinate teams of planes on each side in a swirling dogfight. Good laughs and fun. Requires a bit of a steady hand to play though.

A game of WWI airplane combat. The thing that I like the most with this game is the simplicity of the rules. It can be explained (at least the basic variant without the optional rules) in one minute  The drawback I suppose, is that it is vastly overpriced for a bunch of cards (they should include at least one expansion for that price) and that the cards are really thin and can be thus moved around the table by accident.

RATING: 8
A light game themed on World War I aircraft dogfights.  Players take one or more aircraft, represented by a card, and "fly" it around the table by playing three pre-programmed manoeuvre cards.  These are revealed one at a time, the aircraft is moved according to the movement arrow on the card, with a check for a possibility of firing after each move.  The really clever thing here is that each aircraft has it's own manoeuvre and damage decks, based on it's historic capabilities.  The Camel spins on it's wingtip to the right, thanks to it's powerful rotary engine, while the Spad and Albatros DVa fly like fast rocks but with turning circles similar to the Titanic.  This is really clever stuff, wrapped up in a package kids can play.  Very impressive, and a great example of historical simulations meeting "Euro" mechanics and working well.  Downside is the teasers of aircraft you can't fly (no "B" damage deck in the base game), but it's a delicious promise of what's to come.  Great stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yet another base hit for Fantasy Flight! A great little miniature game that uses cards for the pieces themselves, just like Wreckage. Awesome production values and some cool little details: planes turn right faster due to the propellors, damage is hidden from your opponents, different maneuverability options for each plane, etc. Low-maintanence fun.

Good.  What a fantastic concept.  Like all great ideas, it's utterly simple, in the "why didn't I think of that?" way.

The main criticism is that it doesn't feel like there's that much game there.  It's fun flying around and trying to outguess people, but mostly it feels really light.

Another small knock is that I wish it was easier to balance the sides using different planes from different sets.

Freakin fantastic game.  All the fun of tabletop boardless gaming with minimal setup.  Rules clarity is great, fiction is great, lots of mechanical and historical accuracy built into the cards so you don't have to manage things like turn rates being different on different planes in different directions, etc... lots of players making rediculous biplane sounds as they take their turn.  Man, this game rocks. (Look at "Wreckage" too for a similar take on Car Wars)

Card game simulating WW1 dogfights, although perhaps takes up too much space.  The newer WW2 seem to have improved the rules, and also come with 6 instead of 4 decks.

RATING: 7
WW1 aerial dogfights and missions, played with cards? Works pretty well, and the hidden maneuvers provide some exciting situations! Highly recommended, although the newly added miniatures take away some of the "blandness" of mere cards. But it's still a great game.

This game is stangely addictive.  Play it once and you will be running to the game store or ebay trying to buy the planes.  Easy to learn, quick game play (20 min with 4 players).  This has quickly become one of my favorites.

RATING: 6
A unique filler game where you get to experience WWI dogfighting with your friends. The game play is actually quite interesting even if the damage chits are crazy random. Flying around as hunter and hunted both offer different challenges. Setting yourself up for the Immelmann turn is a lot of fun. We usually play teams for an added bit of competition. The minis are required here for better effect IMO.

Once you get down to 1 on 1, though, things can go on forever.

A purely analog (no hexes) war game.  Abstracts plane battle in an interesting way.  Playing pre-programmed moves from your hand makes it interesting with just enough hidden information.  But the fiddling with the analog part is a nuisance and the actual play becomes a lot of just second guessing the other player's whim.

(2-4 players) Rating based on one play of basic game. Decent enough beer & pretzels fare, but it gets repetitive with all the flying in circles stuff. I'm not sure how the advanced rules would fix that aspect of it. (Yeah, I know, real dogfighting *is* a lot of flying in circles).

Great short game.  A two-player dogfight can be played out in 15 min, which is perfect if waiting for another game to wrap up or people to arrive.  

Can also be played in a more-involved fashion, which I haven't done.

This is a great game, but you need more than 2 players.  It can really drag when it's just 2 planes maneuvering around one another.

Played 1 time. You mean that's it? I expected more from this game somehow. I found it to be a little dull, and worse, in a 4 player game, one plane got shot down (mine), and the other players sontinued to play for over 30 minutes! One of the reasons I like 'German' games is no player elimination, so a thumbs down on that. But the game is overpriced, has a horrible box-insert design to hold components, and includes a pile of stuff you can't even use until you buy the expansion. Disappointing. [orig]

RATING: 5.5
played it once.
first, we had a big "discussion" over shooting  obstruction that the rules weren't clear enough on. as a result of that shot, my buddy drew the card of death.  He wasn't too pleased.  We kept circling around each other for another 30 minutes and i eventually gave up.
It was neat, but the cards tend to shift a lot and at some point I kinda gave up on being a perfectionist with maintaining their exact position.  This is a case where heavy cardboard planes would have served much better. and the rules weren't clear enough on several issues.  I can't imagine I'll bring it out again anytime soon.  It's not bad, but I don't care for games that require a referee.  BTW, This is the worst packaging of a card game I've yet to come across.

not much depth, and too physically finicky.

A lot of fun. Frankly, however, this is a strict subset of the X-Wing Miniatures Game. X-Wing does it better, if assuredly more expensively. I would purchase Wings of War (now Wings of Glory) only if you're either an extreme history buff or as a taster for X-Wing.

Nice little light WWI dogfighting game. Not a lot of strategy, just second guessing the moves of the opponent so that they end up in your sights. Innovative movement mechanics with the maneuver cards. Am less impressed with the damage cards, but it's not bad. Take out the instant-kill cards, period. Fun for a game every so often, but not something I'd suggest or want to play repeatedly. Component quality is a nitpick - the planes should have been tiles and not cards (something like the asset tiles in Uberplay's High Society), considering they get picked up so much. Otherwise, not much to complain about.

Needed a good 2 player game to play when the rest of the family does not feel like gaming.  This game is fun, but there needs to be more published scenarios.

Sopwith Camel - Barker

Ok, this is just the niftiest thing.  The cards actually fly around the table.  It's somewhat immersive, like you have a bird's-eye view of the dogfight.  You need to play on a slightly fuzzy surface to help keep them in place, but when you do, the gameplay is just sweet.  With 4 players it's CRAZY.  With more it must be unbelievable.

RATING: 6
Pretty cool system for WWI dogfighting using cards. Since manoeuvres are always preprogrammed three turns in advance there is a lot of gambling and out-smarting involved. There is also quite a bit of luck when drawing damage cards, and I guess you need to approach the game with beer and pretzels in mind rather than as a serious simulation. Coming from that angle it works very well.

I have ony played free-for-all dogfights with very basic rules so far, and I don't think the appeal will last for more than a handful of matches this way. I do, however, expect my rating to go up with some of the optional rules and scenarios thrown in. On the other hand, the collectible aspect scares me a little bit.

Having played this game a handful of times, I like the premise and the presentation but I rated it low because despite playing quite a few times I never felt like I really grasped how to take my strategy and apply it in the flight controls, I felt like my opportunities for fire and even the outcomes of firing were very random and chaotic.  Also, the lightweight cards have a tendency to slip and mess with their critical orientation especially during situations where two planes cross.

Purchased 8/11/04. First game 8/19/04. A lot of fun. Played with a 13 year old and he absolutely loved it and begged me to play again. Light fun. No heavy thinking, but there is a measure of tactical maneuvering. I put this game in with those that I play when I want to laugh and just have a good time. Perhaps additional expansions will make the game a bit more strategic. It is a bit clumsy as you can so easily move the cards while placing them and removing the old cards. But, if the game isn't taken too seriously, this will not be a problem.

Looks good but unfortunately my set came without the manouvre cards. It seems I got a double lot of the plane cards and the "A" damage cards by mistake. I'll rate it once I rectify the situation.

This game is fun, although can become a chore if you play against very anal people.  The movement mechanic in this game is brilliant. Although it's only played on a two dimensional field I always get the sensation of the physics controlling the planes potential manuverability,  Wings of War is a quick romp unless, as mentioned, you play with people over concerned with slight shifts in the cards.  When we play we call this turbulence.

UPDATE: After the initial honeymoon with this the fun runs thin, and the mechanics, although novel, become a little cumbersome.  It is an enjoyable romp on occasion, but over all is just an average game.

I absolutely LOVE this game. I will never turn down a game of this. It's very easy to learn and play. Best played in teams. 2 player with only 2 planes can be a little dull. It is best played with 4 or more players imo. You have to play a few cards in advance, so things can turn around on you very quickly. This is a very tense game that has lots of feel to it and is a blast to play.

Many thanks to my friend James who introduced this game to me.

This is my entree to tabletop mini games via aerial combat, and I liked it.  It's not something I'll play too much since I just don't have too much interest in tabletop gaming, but this simple, easy, light game had a depth of tactics and strategy.  

Luck element feels right, as does the mechanics versus the simulated experience of the dogfights. I don't mind the "expansion angst" that others feel (seems like the nature of the beast regarding successful games in general).  Not something I'll play a lot based on our gaming groups' taste, but fun once in a while.

Wings of War reminds me a lot of Roborally, a game that I am not a big fan of for many of the same reasons I am somewhat neutral about this game. The simultaneous action selection is done in such a way as to require blind luck, not good bluffing. Movement is fiddly in the sense that a small bump to the table can change the game and it often requires measuring and re-measuring.  Targeting, especially with models, is very subjective as well. It is interesting from a historical standpoint, but many of the planes and pilots are functionally the same. And it does have the "real people died here" problem as well, which may or may not bother you personally. Nevertheless, despite the vast amounts of randomness, it is a fairly solid effort. And although the distinctions between planes are few, the ones that exist are interesting. Nothing about it especially stood out as new and exciting, and nothing about it was very annoying either. I think most of the people that like the game are primarily excited about the models, which are admittedly very nice. Sadly, they are less functional to use than the 2D cardboard pieces that come in the box.

RATING: 6.5
A fast playing air combat game.  Each turn players pick three maneuvers they will be performing, and players reveal each maneuver simultaneously, then resolve any combat before playing the next one.

There are only 4 decks of maneuver cards, which means that one cannot fly two planes of the same type unless one picks up another copy of the game or the maneuvers are written.

After five plays, then cards got sticky.  Using card protectors of some sort would not be all that great as it would make moving more troublesome.

I concur with Jody about the punch being off centered.

One thing which prevents this game from hitting my gaming table more often is the problem with ensuring the cards don't move and/or stick to your hand.

RATING: 7
Exactly what I want in a dogfighting game: quick pace, simple manuever system, and tedious detail kept to a minimum. You MUST play with the minatures for optimal fun. Reminds me of Pirates of the Spanish Main, but less fiddly. The only downside is that it requires a lot of table space.

It is a pity that it was initially released as a 2 dimensional game and the altitude rules added in as an afterthought that feels a bit clunky now that the miniatures are the way to play. However, this is simple, fun, quick and a blast to play, if subject to clumsy fingers when moving the cards (I attribute the unavoidable small errors in measurement and placement to puffs of wind).

This is a great little head-to-head biplane game.  It incorporates differences between some planes, and maneuvering strategy of dog-fights. It is easy to learn, and straight forward to play.  

The downside is that the cards are not as inspiring (but much cheaper) than the miniatures.  I would also recommend not using the altitude rules untill all players have had 3-5 games played.  

Good game, and a good entry into WWI arial combat.  I strongly recommend getting some miniatures if you like this game.

The absolute best implementation of table-top combat I've ever seen.  The rules can be explained and understood in under two minutes; the simultaneous movement turns and superfast combat resolution make the game feel like a real WWI dogfight, with all the attendant frustrations, elations and terror.  

The rule-set is excellent‚Äîneither too much nor too little.  It plays fast and  captures the milieu perfectly.  I was amazed how quickly I adapted to the different performance characteristics of each plane; getting the results I wanted out of a given manuever deck became deftly intuitive.

The only thing missing is the pistol on a lanyard for when you catch fire...

Very light and small. I thought this would be a complete game, but it only has a few rules and 4 plane types. The rest comes in other expansions, as expensive as the core game. There's a slot in each player mat to place a second plane "in the case" you choose to buy THE SAME GAME A SECOND TIME. Eventually you have to spend 200 euros or more to enjoy a game that fits with all expansions in a 35-50 euro format. I hate when publishers make things like this.

The only point of this game is to milk money from Blue Max fans. As a game = 6. minus 3 for the greedy format, total: 3.

Also, burns very quickly even if you buy everything. The minis are cool, they could be revamped for another game.

Traded away.

A classic game that, to my knowledge, started the trend of the template-based miniature dog-fighting games.  It's a fast system that can be tailored to suit taste.  I have only ever played it with the miniatures and I've never used the cards to represent the planes.  I don't play this one anymore (replaced with X-wing) but it is quite good.  I wish it would have started with the WWII version as I find that era more interesting.

I love the easy and advanced rules.  Also the amount of varibles and customization is really nice.  Play with 2 planes each or play with teams, deathmatch, capture the flag, straffing, blowing up balloons or protecting them.  There are a lot of missions in the various rule books and online. The more planes on the map the more fun the game is and engine damage on the first shot to hit you is hilarious.

Nov08: Well, it sure does have it's theme down.  For having so few bits, it really does feel like you're in a dog fight.  The planes are reasonably thematic (for those who care).  And flying around is a lot of fun.

However, it just takes too long in it's current form.  I think I'll switch to drawing double damage cards just to speed the game up in the future.

Also, it could be much better with wingman I imagine.

Still, there's just something about Snoopy versus the Red Baron.

After trying Dawn of war and enjoying it, I picked up the three WW1 games.  I think that the original WWI system is even better than the newer WWII system. (but just barely)  Famous Aces is the first module I'd suggest you pick up if you want a 2-4 player game.  The Flying Drachens set adds in more detail including ground attack missions, elevation rules, balloons, ground based machine guns and artillery units, and rules for solo play, BUT is limited to 2 players out of the box.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hmm..  Quite difficult to judge this title.  One thing is sure: it plays much better with 4 persons than 2.
Most important: this game does not make excellent first impression, you don't get this feeling that you want play it more and more.  
And that's rather sad.  Optional rules from the net might be the rescue.  Didn't really have time and patience to test them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think a 6 or 8 player game of this would really see the system shine but 4 works good. Normally I frown on chaos but that is exactly what will make this game fun and the more the better I think. (did I really say that? :P ) 

Its a nice themactic game of bluff and second-guessing what your opponent will do (where he will fly). It uses programmed actions (3 only)like Roborally, so everyone playing has all the same move cards and the pick 3 of them and put them in the order they want. You play Cat and Mouse here with your opponents or go head to head and battle it out! You feel the theme at work when you just pass by an opponent and must circle back to try and get him in your sights, only your not sure which way to circle!

So everyone reveals their first card and moves their plane accordingly, if planes are within range the firing occurs. Then moves 2 & 3. Essentially thats the game, LOS is checked and damaged is calculated and if taken you get random damage from a draw deck. A fun game that playing in teams is also a fun option, I don't see 2 players being fun at all and even 3 would be pushing it, 4 to 8 or even more would be best here.  

Negatives are the very limited decisions, pretty much pick 3 moves cards thats it. Also the random damage, this is not too bad but there was one card that outright kills you? I would remove that one. 

Nice fast fun filler type game

Initial Rating: 4.0 (February 2012)

I was disappointed with the game (and I played with the advanced rules) but I can understand why so many people like it. In my game group there are a few Wings of Glory junkies‚Ä¶.so I believe I will play it again :S. 

I gave it a 4.0 because I don‚Äôt enjoy the theme nor the mechanics (which I feel are clumsy). The game CAN be fun if you play it with the right crowd, however it is not a game I will request nor buy ever.  For starters it is a very light game, and has way too much luck in the form of the damage cards. The gameplay is short but I feel it was too long as I don‚Äôt enjoy the game as much as my friends.

Perhaps I don‚Äôt like the pre-programmed cards mechanic as I also don‚Äôt  like RoboRally.

The game is beautiful, I give you that. Moreover if you play with the miniatures :D But that¬¥s not enough to make me play the game again. With miniatures the game is a 4.5 to me. Also I like the fact that the miniatures are replicas of actual airplanes, but that is not enough for me.

Perhaps I can like X-wing the miniature game a lot more because I love that theme.

**A fun, light, dog fight game with style.**

--I'd start with this set if you're curious about the system.

I love this one right now and it's a personal favorite; this is Fun, quick, easy to play, and has led to laughs. 

The wild battles have been a blast and I feel the anticipation of trying to keep my enemy in my sites and bring him down. It really captures dogfighting in a simple, clever, and fun way. Each plane flies different and it's brilliant in how it captures the feel.

I must admit to being a bit of a WWI dog fight lover, but that is in no way needed by anyone playing this game. Really, it's just fun and can be played by anyone in the family.

Why does it appeal to me? In part, I grew up loving a "Red Baron" arcade game in the 80's, TSR's "Dawn Patrol" game hit an unexpected chord with me in my youth, and--because of an uncle who died much too early in life--I grew up with Snoopy battling the Red Baron in the great blue.

This is a fun fast game that has a theme that appeals to me and it's a game that can be enjoyed by anyone from 9 years old and up.

A very clever aerial game design that suffers from poor production quality.  The 'plane' cards should be of heavier card stock providing more stability for line-of-fire accuracy and the counters should have been centered better before punching (mine were way off!).

I'm not into WWI simulations or aircraft simulations, and I found this
to be a really FUN game.  It's dripping with theme, and it really
feels like you're flying around the table (weaving in and out and
around and around).  Make no mistake, though, this is a German game,
so it's not a detailed simulation (and serious gronards will be
seriously dissappointed).  What it lacks in detailed perfectionism,
though, it makes up for in FUN.
 
I've played it all different ways: 2-player with 2 planes per side,
3-player (every man for himself) and 4-player (2 teams of 2 planes,
one per person), and they all play really, really well.  I think I
liked the 3-player free for all the most.  I've also played it solo, 2
planes per side, and had a blast.  Pure, simple fun!  Did I mention
the FUN?
 
P.S. I  strongly  recommend taking out the instant kill.  It serves no purpose....

El juego b√°sico, sin miniaturas, es un juego de cartas que se mueven. Una vez que compras un par de miniaturas, la cosa toma otro aspecto, y te da la sensaci√≥n de un juego de aviones.

Despite the efforts made to add some historical flavour (beautifull plane designs, names of real pilots, plus an attempt to simulate the advantages and limits of the various planes), there are only a couple of historical scenarios or situations in the box, which is a bit disappointing.

This is the non-Star Wars version of "X-Wing Miniatures." It's a game where you use tabletop minis (in this case WW1 and WW2 planes) and battle them. Really fun, but I play a lot less of these 1v1 battle games these days.

Being a WWI buff, I have a soft spot for this game.  But I think I would like this game more if I got the mini-models & replaced the well done illustrated cards with them.  I'm always looking for a great WWI game & this comes close but only scratches the surface.  Don't get me wrong--I'll play it with anyone who wants to.  But I really think I should get some of the models & give it another serious try.

Seems like this is going to need more than 2 players, 2 planes to be a lot of fun. Lots of turning, flipping, going 'round each other without mcuh contact with just 2 on a large-ish table. Now I think I also need a smaller table or just a more confined space. I also figured out we were making getting hits harder than the rules say by aiming at plane diagrams rather than plane cards.

RATING: 7.5
Don't play with the explosion card. I know it happened in real life but in a game it's not so fun to get taken out early and have to sit and watch everyone else have fun. That being said the game is quite fun and the mini's really add a bit to the whole experience although far from nessesary. Plays great right out tof the box.

Wings of War is a very fun game.  I first tried this game on one of my many WESTPAC deployments, after going in with a Navy friend to by a copy in Singapore.

RATING: 7
Cool idea for a game.  I have no interest in miniatures gaming, but I'm assuming that this is a drastically simplified version of it.  I like how the different planes have different abilities, making for some interesting match-ups.  The total random nature of the damage deck is thematic, I guess, but frustrating.  It can be a little boring when you keep buzzing around, missing each other, but it is still quite fun, and plays pretty quickly.

VERY fun game, just the right amount of randomness. Love the fact that the planes are true-to-life (like the Sopwith Camels doing hard right turns but no hard lefts). Very much looking forward to getting the other two sets and blisters...

This game is a lot of fun! I'm not a big fan of steep learning curves, preferring more simple rules that scale up with add-ons or rely more on the overall strategic skill of the players. I'm not a great strategic player by any means but I still love a fun battle game (whether I lose or not).

Anyway, my game group had this (and I think an expansion as well) and we decided to play on one of our "off" nights. There were five of us in total, all newbie WoW players and one a newbie for gaming overall. The range of player skill ranged from the bigtime tactical guys, to the middle ground (me) to the completely inexperienced. We all walked away after 2 hours of play LOVING this game. The aerial battles are abstract but still have a degree of authenticity to them. There's also the added bonus that your playing field is the size of the table you're using and a map or terrain isn't needed. Just set up and go in less than five minutes.

Wings of War is easy to learn, doesn't burn a hole in your wallet, and seems to have good replay value. Some of the round-to-round damage condition tracking can be awkward at first, but not enough to bog the game down.
One of the guys in my group is even teaching a stripped down version to his elementary age kids, I'm assuming with some of that damage tracking simplified or removed. 

If you want a "party" game that isn't some sort of mainstream buy-at-walmart variety, I recommend this.

Wings of War has a great mechanic - using cards to move cards.  The way the cards have flight paths on them is just beautiful.  It really makes you feel like you're flying a plane.  With the three-maneuver rule, you never really know who's going to be where at the end of a turn.

Edit: 
I ran a campaign for this from 2010 - 2011 and had a blast.  Raised rating from 8 to 8.5.

The variability of the maneuver cards and the different specs make this game an instabuy, but I have to admit it takes a bit longer than I'd like with two.  I'll bet with five or four you'd get a bunch of planes flying in and out of each others' firing arcs, the game would shine (and be a bit quicker).

Light weight WWI game.  Very simple rules, with additional complexity if desired.  Plays very quickly, a simple game taking around 15 minutes.

Suffers a bit from not having enough manuever decks (for flying more than one of the same type of plane, although there are workarounds) and not having a B damage deck for the tri-plane, all of course solvable by purchasing another kit.  But it is playable as is.

Lots of fun, for the table or floor.

First of all, I don't know if this is the right game title to rate as we simply played with available components and not necessarily the pieces strictly from this (or any one) game title.  Based on three plays; three players (two planes against two planes), five player free-for-all and a three player free-for-all.  This was interesting and fun.  I'd definitely like to play it again and am looking to get some of the minis for my Burning Drachens set.  However, I'm not sure I'd always want to play this; I think I'd have to be in the mood for this type of game thus I'm rating it a six.

I should like this game - aviation theme, simple gameplay - but I don't like it all that much. Cards seem too easily moved, fudging of gun cone and range can lead to problems - and it's waaaaay too expensive for what it is. If the price were halved, or even reduced by a quarter, it'd be fine, but as it is, too much to buy new.

(I rate this an 8 with people who haven't already played it a couple of times, ha ha.)

The good things about this game: it's super-easy to teach, even to kids & non-gamers (the burrito boy, age 6, likes it); it plays quickly; it's "different" from everything else I own.

The not-so-good: the scenarios included in this box range from "you each have one plane... fight!" to "you each have two planes... fight!"  (The rules include more interesting scenarios, but they require other sets, which bugs me.)  So people enjoy the first couple of games, but then never ask for it again.  Replayability might improve if you buy other sets, but... at $30 for four planes, that's a lot of money for a pretty light game!

I LOVE biplanes, but this game is bad.  I wish you could cut out little planes, put them together, and fly them around!  Then, I would give it the same rating I gave Pirates of the Spanish Main. EDIT:  The artwork and the effort of making a biplane game is cool.  I raised my rating to that of the Pirate game.  I would like to see an updated version of this game, possibly with non-cards.  The game was quite boring actually.  Its one of the few times I put the game away while in the middle of play.  Its was almost a stale mate...

Want a quick game of Roborally?  Play this game instead.  Fun little plan ahead movement game with shooting after each maneuver.  Take out the explosion card though to avoid a quick kill which is rather indiscriminate and just a tad unfair.

RATING: 3
Flight combat using cards.  A bit fiddly to me. Player gets to choose 3 manouver cards from the set of cards relating the class of the plane.  The cards indicate the directions of the plane moving with arrows linking each cards.  The plane card would arrive at the final position by following the arrows and get to fire at enemy aircraft within range measured by a ruler.  At close range, it would score 2 hits and 1 at long range.  The hit cards have some special effects, spicing up the generally manouvering dominant game.  Overall, not a bad game but I don't get excited about it either.  If you have a kid, however, this is the perfect choice of introducing wargaming to him or her.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great production values, brilliant mechanics, fast play from solo to six.  I have played and enjoyed WWI flying games from Richtofen's War through Ace of Aces flip books and Blue Max, plus Crimson Skies.  I like the way the cards run the game system while allowing the player to concentrate on flying.  If you play fast, like we do, what you lose in some of the detail of other games you gain in an almost visceral game experience of flying.  The hidden damage system builds in tension: how much more will it take to finally finish this guy off?

If someone would print a tablecloth with a bird's eye view of the trenches I woul
d so buy it :-)

EDIT:  Now with the miniatures everybody will play this.  Even my wife.  If you don't like something, it is easy to modify.  For example, instead of blazing away, we played where you can "pip" the enemy and not jam except on a red symbol; damage is -1 per card, though.  Cries out for a campaign system.  The minis are nice, by the way, and come with their own manuever deck.

Ok first things first - no card game with only a few counters should cost ¬£19.99 in the UK.  A lower price point would allow entry into the series for a greater number of people and increase the success of the subsequent expansions, miniatures etc.  Gripe over.

Once past the price point which I feel is a very big barrier to many people(which turns my rating from an 9.5 to a 8) , the game does offer real value (I know this sounds contradictory but a bit cheaper and it would be the game I would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone), entertainment and interesting challenges in a wonderfully evocative system based on real attention to detail by the designers.

Simple rules means this game can be played out of the box in only a few minutes and will capture your imagination for a lot longer.  Sadly I feel in the UK fewer people will discover this for themselves because of the price point.  Oh well maybe gripe not over.

RATING: 6
A fairly good lightweight Air combat game. A bit too simple, with no speed and altitude rules (until Burning Drachens and the Dawn of War WWII game). The use of maneuver cards makes it possible to simulate the differences in performance easily and simply.

However, the downside is that you need a copy of the correct maneuver deck for each plane, making it difficult to have more than one example of a type in play at the same time.

And, seriously: An air combat game that doesn't feature any altitude rules at all (note: until the later expansions)? WWI may not have been big on energy fighters, but you can't fight in the air without the vertical

My rate could be a 7: sometimes I would play it, but I think I wouldn't choose it among other games to play.
I rate it 5 because damage cards are too much fortune dependent: there's too much difference between 5 and 0. And there is also the explosion!!!

RATING: 6
A great concept and a good game. It's actually close to being better than that, but some little nits like worrying about disturbing the plane cards, having enough maneuver decks, and players forgetting/not knowing their damage score and damage icons limit it a bit. I don't miss the lack of 3D movement (altitude at all)--game works fine without it.

2-4p, 30m.  Basically a combat miniatures game, but using cards instead of figurines.  Uses a ruler to measure line of sight.

Big surprise of 2009 (new to us).  Tons of fun little game.  Our 4 player battles are outstanding.  For a $20 game this is a best buy for replayability.  Of course it comes with getting hooked and wanting lots of new planes!

Sadly replaced by X-Wing.  We got our money's worth and then some out of this one though.

RATING: 4
2P played several times.  I'm sure the strong theme and simple mechanics replicate the chaos of biplane dogfights of WWI, but it's a frustrating game. It's rare to find yourself able to shoot your opponent when he can't shoot you too.  Nor is such fortuitous guesswork rewarded - damage is too random (loads of zero hits) and planes are too sturdy.  This results in a game fundamentally undone by its combination of light-weightedness, repetitiveness and excessive length (2hrs for 4 planes last night).   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting system so far. Need to play it more to really decide if I'm super stoked or not. I don't know that I'm interested in jumping in and owning it myself, since I'd really not want to play without the minis.

A very thematic cardgame about dogfighting in WWI. It's a bit slow and fiddly to play, but I like the strategic thinking and the amount of bluffing required to play this game. 

You do need a playing area large enough for some intersting moves but don't go overboard when you just want to play a one-on-one dogfight.

My 6yo and I have played this game 3 times this week and it's by far his favorite game of the moment.  Of the 3 games, he's won 2 by his erratic flying alone!  The rules are easy enough for him to grasp without many reminders.  Damage and special damage is very well done with the cards and the symbols help tremendously.  I also have "Watch Your Back", so during one game he had a 2-seater and I had a very maneuverable fighter.  If he didn't fly his plane off the table, I'm sure it would have been a close game.  I can't wait to get my 8yo involved with this one.  Great for kids!!!

RATING: N/A
I really like this game conceptually; in reality I think this game requires a certain situation to shine.  First off, I think you need a group about 8-10 people interested in playing.  Each person should buy 1 miniature for each side of the conflict (2 total).  This way the cost to play is relatively low, but you have sufficient planes in the air for scenarios and dogfights.

Note: 2p this game is either two plains circling endlessly or, with more planes, too much bookkeeping.

This game is undoubtedly fun, however, I would have prefered more manouver decks included in the base game.  I like the way different planes have different movement characteristics - it is a nice touch!!

All planes during WWI were not created equal. The designers of the game have did their homework to recreate the planes attributes.

I am very excited to play a huge multiplayer battle of Wings of War. It would be an absolute riot.

Our favorite way to play is on a pool table with the edges the available play space.

A great game and my favorite plane game without a doubt!  It would be nice to have an expansion that added a detailed campaign component similar to that found in TSR's Dawn Patrol.

RATING: 7
05/07/07 Received. Many have complained this isn't a whole game; that you are almost forced to buy other games in the series to have enough planes and maneuver/damage decks to play a "sensible" game. The answer isn't a straight yes or no, but falls into that gray area in between. You *can* play Wings of War with just one of these sets, but its rather unsatisfying and very limiting. I initially bought Watch Your Back! and Burning Drachens but then felt I *must* buy Famous Aces to have what many players would call a complete set. Is this sneakiness on the part of the publishers, or simply economic reality (what you can realistically put in one box for a reasonable price). Probably a little of both.

This game reminds me of the game Aces of Aces.  It's great fun and in fact play relatively fast. This set has a couple of High profile pilot, which can add some value to the historical background of the game. 

The fact that it is a collectible is a bit of a turn off, but since i play on someone else copy, it's a slight turn off rapidly forgot.

Upping my rating after a few two- and four-player games.  Yeah, it's beer and pretzels time, but what a good time it is.  Chaos AND strategy.  I like it...a lot.  Reminds me of Crimson Skies (table top).  I'm trying to figure out how I can use those minis with THIS game.  Maybe paint arrows on the bases of the the minis?

Looked promising, but after a few plays found it too simple. Also, I can't stand card-based games that have tiny cards. In this case, it's magnified because you have to be fairly exact in your card placement on the table (for firing arcs and distances).

RATING: 5
A light filler game, held together by the unlikely adaptation of tile-laying to WWI air combat, which turns out to be a pretty clever mechanic. It is what it is: if you want detail and realism look elsewhere. I do think it succeeds in capturing the flavor of the subject, aided by the nice visuals.
 
However I share people's frustration about the flimsy production values for the cards. One of the real attractions of this game should be the tactile pleasure of laying down the cards and watching the dogfight unfold. Instead this is overshadowed by the minutiae of constant fiddling to keep the cards in place. Too bad. And yes, people should have been able to fly two planes together on patrol from the kit in the box, instead of having to buy additional manuever decks.

Very playable and easy to get into.  Helps to play on a cloth table top or some other surface that keeps the cards from slipping.  Endless scenario and campaign potential.

Has all the elements to make it feel like a dogfighting game, without all the unecessary fluff. Almost as good as Canvas Eagles, but so much more easy to explain. Altitude rules would add more realism but also more complexity; I would play WoA with more casual players/when I have less than 1hr of free time, and CE otherwise. 
Update: Lowered my rating from 7 to 5 after discovering wreckage, which offers the same game but in a much cooler package/theme

RATING: 5.5
I was a bit disappointed with my first two plays of this game.  I respect the simple elegant system but overall I didn't feel like I had enough control.  There are some tactics but it seemed too much of a guessing game for my likes.  However, it is probably a fair simulation of WW2 dog-fighting and future plays with expansions and more players will hopefully result in a higher ranking.  UPDATE: Moving rank down again.  If I had to play a dog-fight game I would much rather play Zero! since I seem to be spatially-challenged.

(Note: Same as my review for WoW Burning Drachens) This game really scratches the itch for a light, accessible and quick playing war game.  It is incredibly compelling.  It takes only a few minutes to explain (the basic rules); can be played in a half hour or less; is customizable with minis; and really lends itself to getting involved in the storyline of the mission.  The variety of possible missions is wonderful!  Can't wait for even more expansions!

RATING: 10
Wings of War was a delightful surprise for me when I took the plunge and bought the game.  It is a quickly learned game, that almost any age can enjoy.  I have tried many WWI flying games and WOW tops them all. The mechanics are simple, but the individual flight characteristics of the different aircraft are modeled well.  The game really rocks when you get the miniatures and put them on the table... we have played as many as 8 players, and the game went smoothly and everyone had a great time.  This game will attract a crowd!  This game may not be for the overly anal, as the planes (especially miniatures) can be bumped and said person may freak by seeing planes not place exactly.  The game works very well with one person playing as a referee that can call any close shots.  Fun, fun and more fun!!  Have now played a scenario with 3 DH4's bombing a village with 5 escorts opposed by 6 Germans... woot!!!  (DH4's didn't complete the mission, but oh my they are dangerous!)

[played 10+ times]

A good easy game. Set is intended for 2-4 player, but you can combine with other to play with more fellows, ore use some tricks to play up to 20 (!) with a single set. I like more with advanced rules (tail & special damage).

A really fun game, and the miniatures add a lot to it - giving the game an additional layer of theme. Definitely an antidote to heavy going euro games, Wings of War plays quickly and generates a lot of talk and laughs as the manoeuvres pay off or fail miserably. Reminded me of Roborally in a way.

Gameplay is easy and quick and entertaining. I don't think that the components are worth the $30 list price (or $20 at most on-line retailers). It's annoying having only one maneuver deck of each type in the box--I can't imagine that it would cost that much more to include two sets of each letter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very light tabletop game.  Each player controls one (or more) airplanes, and then plays movement cards to move the airplane along the tabletop.  Movement occurs in real space, but aligning the bottom of the movement card with the top of the airplane card, and then moving the airplane to the top of the movement card (i.e., if a movement card has an arrow drawn to the left, the plan moves exactly that far to the left).  

The game is quick to play and easy to learn.  There is a ton of randomness (damage is done by randomly drawing cards) and un-predictability, but it's so quick that it's not a problem.  It gets an 8 from me because it seems like a great way to start an evening of gaming, or a nice light break between meatier games.

So far I've only played with two players, but it looks like it'd be chaotically fun with three or four.

To be honest, I had seen this game on BGG and thought it was sort of silly initially.  Played it once and found it fun though.  I'm not sure how this game managed to spawn so many expansions though (I guess there must be a lot of World War I enthusiasts out there).  I guess gameplay can change with different plane maneuvers but it's still the same basic game.  Still a fun game though.

Really lovely game of world war 1 combat. The rules are pretty much as simple as you can get without losing the feel of the real thing. However, dont play on a slippy surface and DON'T SNEEZE!!. The miniatures look really cool and give a whole new dimension to the look of the game.

RATING: 8
A clever and simple but effective design. Really fun how the various movement decks generate widely different plane performances. (That Hanriot HD1's sure a nice little plane, isn't it?) I can't say I enjoyed the one dogfight we tried with the altitude rules: for us they turned a fast, fun game into a frustrating one.

Also have several expansions, including [i]Watch Your Back!, Burning Drachens, Top Fighters, Dogfight Pack[/i], and twenty of the miniatures--beautifully done! The game really comes alive with the minis, and they've actually helped me to better visualize my maneuvers. [29 plays]

Light and fun wargaming! I use this as a filler cause easy to assemble the game on table, decide the scenario and just start flying. I am hooked.

Sometimes it is fun to use altitude rules and tight damage rules and sometimes you just want to play it arcade style.

A gem of a system!  Vastly surprised to have missed this until now.  Exceptionally fun, quick, and accessible.  Rating likely to climb.

Not so fond of the Insta-kill card and the fact that damage to the plane is entirely separate from the parts that may be affected.  You could be zooming alone fine with one hit point left, or have one 2-point hit and be vaporized.  i know there needs to be some randomosity, but it could be dealt with a bit better.

Nice, light game, with excellent art work on the cards.  Plays out quickly and has an historical feel and simultaneous movement without overly detailed rules.  My 7 year old boy enjoys it.  Bit pricey (at least in the UK) for what you get, especially if you also get the expansions.

The rating system doesn't really fit this one.  On pure mechanics/look I'd give it an 8.  Unfortunately the box lacks enough decks to really make it a stand alone game and all of the expansions follow the same model.  See my review below.

A lot of fun! Trying to out maneuver and out guess your opponents is a good time.  I play without the auto-kill damage card and I've only played with 4-5.  Only downside is getting eliminated early and watching the others play for 15-20 minutes.

RATING: 5
Demoed this game at GenCon 07, and ended up buying it along with 4 of the bi-plane minis.  I've since played it three more times, and each time it has been quick fun.  I dare anyone to play this game and not make cheesy airplane noises and "rat-a-tat-tat" sounds.  I got the game thinking that it would work well with my daughters (9 and 12), and yeah, it did.  The mechanics are quick to pick up.  It requires some simple planning ahead, and with the minis there is a nice tactile / visual component.  Usually, rather than a free for all, I make it them versus me, or make it "cross the table twice without getting 5 hits," etc.  And yeah, there is something about it that reminds me of those old book vs. book games.  The ones with 1st person p.o.v. illustrations, and where you're picking maneuvers in your book and turning to various pages depending upon your opponent's maneuvers.

Update 1:  It would REALLY help if the original box had space for storing the planes in a secure manner.

Update 2: Lowered score.  There's something missing in this game...there's no tension or changes in game pace.  The card movement mechanism is great, but there is NEVER a sense of panic or suddeness.  It's like a battle of attrition, but with planes.  Not sure why or what I would do to fix.

Update 3: Raised score based on purchase of "Burning Drachens."  This turns the base game into a much better game.  This is where you'll find the altitude rules, and now you are not only dueling with another plane but worrying dodging anti-aircraft fire while attacking / defending zeppelin-like balloons.  Still, not really my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A very elegant and simple WW I airplane dueling game. Each player has a deck of cards with directions for movement (left, straight, right, stall, etc). Players plan three moves in advance. After each move, players can fire if the enemy plane is within your line of sight. Damage is drawn from a common damage deck - damage ranges from 0 to 5 and the hit points on the plane range from 13 to 15. Short range hits cause your opponent to draw 2 cards, instead of 1 card at long range. It's very light, fun, but there is a huge luck factor with the damage cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Light card game that's easy to enjoy during a lunch break. I like the fixed damage values. Would like to see the maneuver cards semi-randomized by drawing from a deck. I liked the turn structure and the timing rules.

RATING: 6
I've only played 1-plane vs 1-plane so far with this game and we spend a lot of time circling and trying to get into position. 2-planes per side would certainly bump up the interaction and thus, assumedly, the fun factor of the game. 

I got some of the miniatures for Christmas and they certainly bump up the appeal of the game. Having tiny planes "fly" around is more entertaining than sliding cards. 

We played a 4 person free-for-all and ran into a problem with the base mechanics of the game, using cards to get into position with multiple people trying to move cards and planes. Place the card, move the plane, but maybe the card slipped a little or you bumped the plane either into or out of firing range. A little too imprecise for some people's taste.

I'm also rating all my Wings of war collection as one game since I keep them all together. Without solo rules it's a solid 8.

I'm not sure if we used the entire ruleset, but this seems like a light flight sim type game. I liked how quickly the turns could go, and the free flowing aspect was pretty cool. The approximate nature of the movement worked with the theme, I think, since there would always be some variability in how you placed the cards down. It was a bit annoying not being able to tell at first where you'd end up specifically, but it worked out in the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression: Interestingly different card game concept as cards are being used as "miniatures". Short and fun filler. Works pretty well with 4-players but the original card sets aren't best balanced for that. You need at least some expansion to have more balanced teams.

Doesn't seem to do anything for me.  I can see it being fun for some people, but I consider myself a fan of the theme, and still didn't enjoy it.  Part of the problem for me is that the rules are too open-ended.  Anyone who has played an Eagle Games product in the past knows what I am referring to.  Do we really need so many optional rules?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good fun. Loads of potential with missions and custom rules such as squad rosters. But a great game to play just using the boxed rules. This game can  outstay it's welcome if manuevers don't coincide and the planes fly in circles forever. (7)

I feel that this game is just a reworking of Ace of Aces, except much less portable, and prone to being upset by bumping the table.

Great game for my HS game club.  Get a game going with 12 planes in the air and you'll have a blast!

BTW - we take out all of the zero damage cards and ignore the effects.  This streamlines the game for younger players and makes it go faster.

This is great team building game as well.  6 German planes vs 6 Allied planes = FUN TIMES!

Rating based on one play.  Very engaging light wargame that heavy on tactics.

A very streamlined design that took less than five minutes to learn.  Recommended.

A quick, fun little game. Easily taught, easily played. Some of the planes are painfully limited in their tactics... I guess that's just the historical reality of things, but it must have driven those pilots crazy that some of their planes were incapable of, say, a 90 degree left turn, or even a 75 degree left turn?

Oh well.  It's so quick and playable that you can use this as a break between games or as a diversion for people eliminated from the big bad boardgame X happening on Table #1.

Tried basic rules demo with 2 on 2 dogfighting. Liked the idea of using the cards  for maneuvering your planes but the mechanic became tedious after a few turns. Some type of terrain(clouds, mountaintop) and scenarios would add a lot.  Nice "light" wargame when looking for a break from heavier more involved table top. Would definitely play again but don't think I'll invest. Reminded me a lot of my experience with Crimson Skies. Preferred the single card & movement tokens of CS over the multiple cards of WoW.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The base set feels stripped down, the A and B planes manouver quite badly. If you use bigger area where planes can fly in, it gets boring because you just fly around a lot and neither side gets to shoot anyone. If you choose a small play area then the battle is more tense, but may end quickly for the A or B planes because they just dont manage to maneuver well enough and fly off the playing area. Solution would be to use more planes at once (like 8 or so) and with better maneuver decks so that there is always a threat of getting shot at. For that you need to buy another sets of the game and I don¬¥t like this kind of marketing. With the base set the solution would be to use some house rules (like respawning) or create some missions to fulfill for one side and let other side try to hold them back.

Seems like it should be more fun than it actually is. It just seems like there's something missing from a game where you move little airplanes around your dining room table with rulers.

Great miniatures. The system of movement by cards, well I do not like it, as simple as that. I love hexagons or areas because they avoid any fake movement by mm.. The minis are fantastic, this is the reason of my rate, and I use them to play with otehr WWI air combat rules.

Excellent recreation of WWI aircraft battles... War games can't get much better than this and the minis on this game are friendly and beautiful.  This game plays so smoothly and introducing the adavanced stuff is easy to grasp and doesn't slow the game down.  This is a benefit over Ace of Aces where the game could bog down as you added additional advanced rules.

A simple, pleasant simulation of WWI aerial combat.  However, the damage effects are seriously random, and the strategy too often amounts to a rock-paper-scissors decision.

Cool miniatures game.  I still suck big time at calculating my space and crash into things all the time. But I like the idea a lot. Definitely a different game with the miniatures and the mat than it would be with just the cards.

EDIT: The luck of the draw on the damage decks does mess up the experience for me. Positioning the plane in a good spot is a lot of work, which can go to nothing if you don't deal the right damage.

The planes are not balanced, and I played a campaign, meaning any issues with the mission design were lopsided. Perhaps playing this only two player (vs. four in the campaign) and doing matches would improve the experience.

When I bought it, I expected a lot more than I got.  In the end, it was way too fiddly for me and my friends.  The cards don't stay put, the ruler is annoying, and blah.  If the components were different .. say .. Thick-stock paper for the planes, and connected to it is a  string to measure firing distance - OK.  But no, that's not what you get. You get a pile of tiny, flimsy cards, a few rulers, and a headache. Blah. Wake me up when it gets revised.

Only tried the 2-player.  Just not much there, flying around trying to get a chance to shoot the other, dependent on drawing good damage cards, finally miscalculating and flying off the edge of the table to end the game quick, but not quick enough.

Fun game. The faster planes (with lower manoeuvrability) seem to be a bit underpowered, but I like the way this game works.
I'd recommend you play with the Explosion card in the second half of the damage deck, to avoid people dropping out to early in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mechanically, this is a wonderful simulation with attention to detail as to who flew the plane as well as the unique manner in how the plane performs. Can be a little fiddly and there can be an issue amongst fiercely competitive players about being 1mm within shooting range. I found two players gave a sparse feel, with 2 teams of 2 better in that there is more to target as well as increasing the interesting speculation of where will the enemy planes go next (once you relate to the individual movement decks). However I'm now finding even with 4, there are moments of no progressive results which feels dull (similar experiences with Adel) and strongly suspect this plays best with 6-8 with the necessary house rule of first plane down, the opposing team wins.

I thought it was conceptually very interesting.  I also loved how well they integrated the movement and combat of standard miniatures games into a card system that you don't have to think about or break out a ruler to check.

The accessibility of this game to a larger audiences is really astounding in how well it was designed.  

My only gripe is that the miniatures themselves are the clear draw of this game, especially for non-gamers.  And they are themselves the most expensive part of the whole package.  I'm glad they sold the game separately so that the cost wasn't quite so high, but I wish the miniatures didn't cost an arm and a leg.

Terrific WWI aerial game. Play is easy on an open table ala miniatures, cards are a visual delight, and aircraft distinctions are more than adequately included in painless ways. Very good as a filler game and can be played with teams or in a free-for-all. No altitude or ammo depletion (but with jamming) rules. The biggest drawback (but historically consistent) is the extreme range of outcomes in damage; one game I had 5 'hits' but 4 were for 0 damage, in the next game my plane exploded on the first shot. Exciting but not for serious competitive play which keeps this from rating an 8. I do intend to purchase it and all expansions though. Play with miniatures and altitude rules add a bit to the game. OK, the miniatures make it an 8 just for the pure fun of it.

Something like "Blue Max" (miniatures edition) would be a far superior choice and just as easy to play. Simplified Blue Max even easier than WoW. Canvas Eagles would be an overkill though due to the extra detail. Overall, WoW is a good kids game or a simple game that is good on family night (Substitute for Monopoly).

Fast simple dog fight game.  I love the way the movement cards aproximate the actual perfomance of the planes they are supposed to simulate.

Additionally the game is just fun to play.  A lot of the game is trying to guess where your opponent will move and respond accordingly.

Only problem is there is no 3rd dimension (fixed by Burning Drachens expansion).

A decent filler game, simple rules, quickly played, with interesting decisions to make and none of them obvious.  No luck in the play of the cards, except as far as guessing what your opponent will do is "luck" instead of skill.  Some luck in how successful your hits are (greatly mitigated by throwing out the "critical hit" damage card).

fun game. maybe a little over-priced for what you get, but if you enjoy the game i guess that doesn't matter too much. better than roborally gamewise, as this game is much more flexible and less random. need to play with the advanced rules, i think. i've only played this with the basic rules and i thought that the game was pretty good, but not so much fun that i had to but my own copy or have the desire to play it much. i would happily play this if other people were interested in playing though. could move up ratings wise for me after a few more plays with the advanced rules.

I like the basic concept and the flying aspect is modelled quite elegant. But there is not much variation in game play and it can drag on quite a bit. Use more than 1 plane per player otherwise there is not much action as you keep missing your enemy.

RATING: 6
This is what Car Wars and Battletech should have been: fast, simple and fun. Still, I think console games do action sims better than a boardgame ever could, and WoW is still too slow to get me into anything more than just a quick dogfight. I grew bored after 20 mins.

Excellent game that is extremely playable, easy to teach and very fast... the cards are high quality with great art--of course, the game is made much better when you use the miniatures... supports large groups and is a perfect filler or main event for game night... without the miniatures, this is a good 7+...  the Deluxe Set includes all the rules, damage cards, and other materials PLUS four miniatures and is the better buy...

Good stuff, this comment also applies to Watch your Back as I found both of the sets pretty similar (i have 'em all in the same box). It's easy to learn, yet has nice depth to it with knowing the abilities of the different planes. The gameplay is easy even with a six year old and all in all it flows pretty nicely. All in all, I had doubts about this game for ages (not sure why), but I'm glad I was wrong!

I got this for my father for Christmas 2009.  He loves it.  I am hoping this will be the gateway to other games that he might like.  If not, at least Wings of War is interesting enough that I would enjoy playing it with him.  

I really like the way movement works and the way combat works.  I also appreciate the time the designer took when designing the movement for the planes.  During our first game my brother was perplexed looking at his cards.  He finally had an "ah-ha!" moment and asked my dad if the plane he was flying had a rotary engine.  My dad told him that it did which explained why my brother did not have the tight turn in the direction that he wanted.  It was impressive. 

There is plenty of tension and hidden information, which keeps the game exciting.  Also, it's very unpredictable.  The minis are very cool, and I would not be interested in playing without them. 

Even though I know very little about WWI airplanes, Wings of War makes me want to learn about them.  Famous Aces makes me interested in the pilots.  I want to know who they were and what made them fly in all of these famous battles.  I am not a history buff.  But this game makes me want to try to learn a little more and expand my knowledge of the past.  That's got to be a cool thing, right?

***Update***

Rating lowered to a seven.

So playing Wings of War every week is getting a little bit boring.  It is still awesome to have an activity that allows me to spend time with my father, but it has become much less of a game.  I absolutely adore that my father has embraced this game.  He has bought all of the available planes and has been doing research on his own.  It's really cool.  He even put in an order to BoardsandBits and he hates the internet!

Recently, he picked up Burning Drachens, and I have high hopes for how this expansion will affect our game play.  We can all play as a team destroying balloons and have the artillery on the ground attack us.  That will be awesome.  It will basically play like a co-op.  Very cool.

Been waffling on this title for a little while now. Finally read a review that gave an idea of what the game is like. Sounds very interesting.

ACE OF ACES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY -- Bought this for my 8yo son's birthday.  Definitely a hit!  Owes a lot to Ace of Aces (I mean that in a good way).  While it lacks the novelty of the flip books I think the progression of the aircraft cards over the table make it more entertaining for the younger set.  Pretty much just a tactical exercise but a very pretty and entertaining one.  I expect some of the other products in the line will be under the Christmas tree this year (if I succeed in waiting that long).

Neat concept...your deck of cards is used to fly your bi-plane around and you try to line up behind your opponent for the kill shot. In practice, it feels rather random though like nothing you choose affects the outcome much unless your opponent is highly predictable.

RATING: N/A
(12/26/07) - Got this as a Christmas gift. Looks like a lot of fun.

(12/28/07) - [4] - Played for the first time today. I like the concept, but don't really like how much luck is involved. Since there's only 3 cards per plane, you're essentially flying in a random pattern and can only shape the order in which things happen. 'Tis a shame, because I was primed and ready to order all of the expansions for this based on concept alone. For now I will stick with just this base game.

(4/28/08) - TRADED AWAY

(8/11/08) - Reflecting back, I don't think I gave Wings of War a fair shake. I tried it once after a long day of gaming and before really taking the time to read the rules. Previous rating is rescinded.

(8/20/08) - Back out of the shadows and into the light, Wings of War is back for another shot!

Unfortunately this is so simple that it is a bit of a dissappointment. However, the cards are beautifully drawn and the game can easily be improved on with a few extra rules. As is it is perfect for the "non gamer" but a bit dull for those of us who have played flying games before.
Upgraded from 6 to 8 after playing several sessions. Yes it is simple but it means that novices pick it up very fast. (But what was the point of the boards ? A complete waste of space).

is fun - i think u should have a rolling card thing instead of rounds of 3 but other than that my only complaint is mb its veers too much towarsd realism over gaminess - i think they should have taken the idea then put it in a future airsports setting so all poss manouevers etc are possible then mb introduced the roborally card limitations so each move is suboptimal etc

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 full game. Wings of War is the system X-wing is based on. Originally it apparently came without miniatures.

WOW works. You pilot several ships (cards), which you program to move. After a move, if you are in range of an opponent you can take shots. IF you kill your opponents ships OR have him fly them of the table. You win.

WOW is good, but I think X-wing firmly replaced it completely. The programmed movement is featured in X-wing as well, but uses a dial instead of cards. That is SUCH an improvement it is amazing.

Really light fun game. I love choosing my actions and seeing the outcome unfold. Sometimes it works perfectly, other times I laugh at how bad I did. And when you can laugh while playing a game terribly, that's what let's you know the game is good.

RATING: 7
Fun game in principle, and I really like the mechanics, but a bit too long for what it is. The picking up and replacing the cards can get tedious - I can see the miniatures making it a lot more fun, but quite an investment for such a light game.  It also gets less fun as the game progresses and there are less planes in the sky.

This is an EXCELLENT game to play with kids in the 6-10 age range.  Well in their reach.  I'm am very much enjoying playing it with my buddies too.  Well worth the money.

Update -- After 20 games I've discovered that everybody loves playing this.  I have the models and they attract attention, and when someone comes into the game they always enjoy it.  Age of Steam players, Agricola players, Bolide players, even Scrabble players smile after a WoW dogfight.  Well worth the purchase price.

I really enjoy Wings of War. It's fun and fast-moving, an all-important trait for an air-to-air combat game. The only thing that can slow it down is analysis issues in choosing which cards to play. I've been able to teach this quite easily to a number of people, and have bought two sets so we can have up to eight planes in play at once. Most everyone likes this game, though the spatially confused will have a hard time with it (and even they enjoy watching their plane fly off into space...).

The only modification I play with is not using the "Boom, you're dead" instant-kill damage card.

Love this one, the capability for 20+ people fighting all in one confusing battle at once. Played Blue Max as a youth, and this captures the same feeling with less fussing. Have struggled somewhat to get good, big games of this going, but I think that may just be happenstance...and also that I'm a little shy about bringing out a wargame for non-wargames, even though I know it's something which goes over great for about any group. Have the battle mats, and they're completely useless (possibly even distracting), but I couldn't help myself.

Have had very memorable games of this. Can't stand minis in most capacities, so have the OOP card version (all of the cards!).

for trade: have both big, heavy, mouse mat material WoW battlemaps, and a mass of cards from all of the sets before they stopped making the card sets only (clash of giants, famous aces, watch your back, burning drachens, some of the booster packs, Wings of GLory). I can't say if I have any complete sets, though, I think a bunch of planes got lost, as well as a bunch of counters (none of the wings of glory ones, though). But I do have all of the maneuver decks, multiples of some. Also I have 2 promo decks from BGG that have to do with pilot skills. I have only one original box: wings of glory. THe other cards are in a 800 count CCG box.

RATING: 7
First half of the Wings of War card game. I refuse to call it a whole base set, as it just includes too little of everything, and some planes for which you don't have manoeuvre decks.

With both sets, you can finally make some more interesting scenarios with 8 planes in the air, and it starts to be a good filler, playable even with small kids.

Of course, the game really shines when you add Wings of War or Wings of Glory miniatures, which fixes the problem of choosing planes so you have enough manoeuvre decks and adds +1000 points to presentation, but then it stops being an easily transportable filler and becomes a game in itself, especially with optional rules. I always play the WWII variant where instead of planning three moves and then executing them one-by-one, you start with planning two, and then execute one and plan one each turn, always having planned one ahead. It almost eliminates situations where each opponent independently decides to fly in separate direction, requiring future rounds to find each other again. Some other optional rules, including altitude, are included in Burning Drachens.

Wings of War uses cards (or miniatures, if you buy them) of planes to duke out dog sights over WWI Europe.  By having a manuever deck, players choose manuever cards for their respective planes and play them on their planes to move them along "flight paths" on the table.  This creates a miniature games using cards and it works quite well.  Online rules for altitude and its twists, along with hidden damage and effects, make this a pretty decent, light miniature game, especially with team.

A very light and simple WW1 air combat game. I think the design here is REALLY cool. That this has the feel of a real (albeit light) miniatures game in the body of a card game is incredible. You can teach this in minutes and just get down to blasting one another, which is what this game is about.

I played the WWII one first, and then got the WWI sets. I do like WWI better overall, but there are some gives and takes. The WWII seems a little more realistic in how you plan your cards. (Not that you can't do that with the WWI sets) I like pulling counters instead of cards. The movement cards in WWII also had a helpful 'card back' outline that you could use. But, WWI plays faster, and has a lot more 'stuff' for it. I like having observation balloons, all the AA guns and such, and planning three cards at once (those less thematic) does make the game go faster. Overall, I prefer the WWI version, not by a huge margin, but enough.

 On game night at the FLGS, we've had as few as two and as many as seven planes at once.  An easy game for new players to jump into with just a quick review of the rules.  If you're playing just the basics can be taught in a five minutes.

I've found that the dynamics of the various planes add a great deal to game play. Some are faster planes - the move further on the straights - and others are better in the turns - very tight turns that allow you to come around behind your opponent quickly. 

I have picked up one mini so far - my favorite plane - the Sopwith Camel.

Have only played dog-fighting with teams of 2... but it was a frikkin hoot!  We had the most excellent mini's which I think somehow added tonnes to the fun of the game - they just look so darn cool.  Very simple to play - over in less than half an hour, a whole bunch of luck too but it's still so fun trying to guess which way your opponent is gonna go, then follow them around with a ratatatatatatatatat.  I imagine it would go down very well with kids too.  If you can afford to get the mini's - do it - they add an incredible amount of theme and fun to the game.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] This is a visual air combat game. Cards are laid out to manuever biplanes and triplanes around the table top (use a big table.) Very worth it if you can get it for around $20. Most recent play in 12-04.

Update: Have now played again, a 7 player scenario with minis that was entertaining. A fun experience that more than made up for random damage outcomes. Good times. With Michael, Corey, Garrett, Donovan, Carter, and Bob L on 12-17-11.

RATING: 7.5
Fun WWI air combat game played with manouevre cards that need to be lined up. Best played in teams using scenarios. Do NOT play this game with players who take things too seriously as the margin for movement and firing arc error is too great. Arguments will abound.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The simple rules work surprisingly well. The maneuver cards were an ingenious idea and the damage system creates diverse situations. Feels like WW1 aerial combat most definetely. I was not that taken with Wings until I got my copy of the Deluxe set, with the miniatures.

I LOVE THIS GAME.  Simple mechanics but a lot of head-to-head strategy.  This is a perfect game to give to someone who loves mini's but not boardgames and vice-versa because it easilly blends the two types.  You could change the components from WWI aircraft to tugboats and it would still work as a dynamic game...mind you, you'd have to equip your tugboats with some big ol' guns.

i think this game deserves to be played again. My first attempt with my gf was a flop as we defined too big a "table" as our boundary. We could hardly shoot down each others' planes. But the game play is really interesting and unique. Will find time to give it another try and I will change my rating then.

An enjoyable game that may be too simplistic for hardcore simulationists/wargamers. I find it best when played by 4-6 players in a real "dawn patrol" manner. Definitely use the altitude rules from the latest exp. (Burning Drachens).

RATING: 8
Wow.  What a cool, simple system for dogfighting.  I love the different movement for each plane.  Very clear design so that movement is easy to chart out in your head.  Beautiful cards (different backgrounds for each card even).  The planes are great to look at and the play boards make things easy to move all the cards status and layout when planes fly to close.  I esspecially love the little additions, like listing the sequence and number of cards on each card.  Overall just a lovely design.  My only complaints, and they aren't that serious is that I wish the planes were on a heavier stock of card and I wish that they would have printed the backs of each decks with their letters on them rather than having to look in the bottom corner to differenciate the different player cards.  Still, this might have been too much of an added expense.

It seemed a bit trivial to me, and the damage cards seem overly random.   It is neat how the planes fly around, but I'm not sure there is enough tactical interest in it to make it worth playing often.  It's no Ace of Aces, that's for sure.

Interesting system.  To me it seems like a card-based miniatures game where players secretly choose movement actions while attempting to anticipate opponents' moves.  Do your best to get into position to fire while avoiding their guns.

Not bad, and I can see why it's popular with my group.  I enjoy the programming aspect of it, but I think it drags on a little bit, as it takes time to shoot people down, not to mention that sometimes you might sit out for a while if you have been eliminated.  The minatures are a must for this.

I really want to like this game, but it is a tad slow for me.  Wouldn't mind trying out the miniatures version to add some life.  I Will keep persevering with this game for a while.  If the cost wasn't so high I would have collected the entire miniatures set by now, even if I didn't play that often.  UPDATE:  the game comes out occasionally and we have a max of one game and it is light entertainment. Sold.

I've cooled to Wings of War since being introduced to the DiF series (specifically Zero!).  Being a big WWI plane buff, the theme is very appealing to me.  Too bad the gameplay just doesn't hold up.  And sadly, the production value doesn't even come close to justifying the game's cost.  Still, I'll play it in the right mood (typically when I need my Red Baron fix).

I really despise RoboRolly and am not much of a wargame guy, but I had great fun with this one. The theming is great for such a simple game. Even the standard rules do a very good job of simulating a dogfight; you don't need to play a scenario to get that feeling. I prefer to play in teams of two rather than two-player, which lacks the cooperative aspect.

This is a cool quick game to play. The maneuver system is really unique and intuitive. The basic game is super easy to teach and pick up but takes skill and practice to master.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I liked this one.  I admit just seeing and hearing about this game I was very skeptical about it, I almost lobbied for us to play something else.  In the end I was glad I tried it.  How the planes move by laying out the cards like that is cool.  I really enjoyed playing it.  It was quick, easy to learn, I felt at least partially in control of what was going on.  The damage cards seemed pretty random.  I definately would not mind playing this game, or any of this series of games again.

Neat quasi-miniatures card game of WW1 aerial combat.  The first two times I played we used the actual plastic model miniatures, which I thought made the game a bit messy.  Using just the airplane cards seems to make game play much smoother/quicker.  Have a big table to provide maneuvering room!

RATING: 5
Neat little game, very good representation of dogfighting (at least, to the best of my knowledge).  The problem is that dogfights just take TOO LONG!  Circling each other endlessly to prepare for your next pass and hope you get a slight edge...It's occasionally fun, but won't come onto my table much.  And the damage cards, while realistic, take away a lot of the interest gained by maneuvering around--you have a reasonable chance of just losing even if you've done 7 cards worth of damage and only taken 4.

So--great design, difficult theme.  I loved Ace of Aces back in the day and this is more accessible (than the advanced AoA, not the basic game), but I don't think the subject matter is actually a good one for a board game as opposed to a video game.

Wings of War, without the plastic planes, but with added pilots with variable skills.

Alas, we didn't use the pilots, so this was basically vanilla WoW. Oddly, I didn't miss the plastic planes as much as I thought I would, but others commented on how much more fun it would be with them.

The rules, whilst not necessarily being that clear, are wonderfully simple so you can pretty much jump straight in.

Doesn't look like my type of game.  I watched/played a good sized Dogfight.  This might move up if I play a couple of the scenario's of the game where there is actually a mission sometime.  Kind of the same problem I always had with First Person Shooters.  I can't stand deathmatches (Doom) but love when I'm part of a team accomplishing a task. (Halo/Call of Duty)

I've played this game a few times.  I don't like it.  I even bought it once at a game store because I really wanted to buy something there, ended up selling it away right away after playing it twice with the kids and game group.

Great simple little beer and pretzels cardgame.  Really captures the dog fight feel and has some fun mechanics.

But its fast to play, and focuses on planning in advance.

This is a simple treatment of aerial combat to make it fast moving and playable.  For me it lacks the detail that would make it both more realistic and provide greater differentiation among the aircraft, which might allow you to exploit their weaknesses or take advantage of their strengths.

RATING: 8
The first few times I played this I just loved it, but after 6-8 games it seems a little repetitive and not one of the games that get requested all the time at our house.  The airplane miniatures are TOTALLY cool - but especially in a one-on-one duel there's a lot of flying around in circles without much actual firing going on sometimes.  And unless someone really screws up, most of the shooting is both planes firing at one another when they come together head-to-head, rarely does anyone get on the other guy's tail.  

But boy are those airplane miniatures cool!

I bought this game with 4 minis: Fokker Dr.I (Richthofen), Sopwith Camel (Olieslager), Spad XIII (Rickenbaker) and Albatros D.Va (Udet).

I've played solo so far, and while it seems the gameplay mechanic works and is a lot of fun, the card laying is a bit fiddly. Planes overlap often and the difficulty to remove maneuvers obstacled by their own plane is a constant problem.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent filler game.  Fly aroun and d the table, shoot your friends, cat and mouse tactics.  It is super light, luck filled with chaos, but the game is short enough that it won't be an issue for me.  The two player game is a slower game of  planning to tail the other player, while the 4 player game needs you to keep your head on a swivel and constantly look for what is next.  I enjoyed Techno Witches but this blows it out of the water.

This could rise if the laughter and fun remain after more plays, or it could drop a point after the "playing with my new toy" factor wears off and all that remains is a solid filler.  

The differences between the flying decks are fun.   I can't control the faster plane but fortunately I am tougher to hit with the fast.  The short rule set manages to bring out the theme quite well.  It has many options to toggle the depth.  So far I have only played super light, but I think if I added all of the optional rules it would hit my personal disdain for games which can't decide if they are light romps are heavier strategy fests.

An appropriately sized playing surface is necessary for this to be fun.  Too small, and there is not much room to maneuver, and too large and the combats will be too far and infrequent. 
  
I am amazed how easy this is to get to the table regardless of the gamer's tastes.  Which surprised me because my geekbuddies are tepid on this title.

RATING: 7
Wow, this was surprisingly fun. I'd heard of Wings of War before but never seriously looked into it and figured wrongly that a game about WWI airplane combat couldn't possibly resonate with me. It turns out that it's remarkably accessible and enjoyable. We played a six-player game divided into two teams of three people each, so we set out the 6 airplane cards on the table, and just started flying around the table trying to shoot each other down. It's a free-form version of RoboRally where you can fly anywhere and the secret and simultaneous movement selection makes for some unexpected results. Fortunately the planes don't collide since they're presumed to have flown at different altitudes, but unfortunately your teammates can surprise you by flying between you and your target enemy. It's very light, but there's enough there to keep it interesting for the quick time it takes to play, and the rules allow for customization depending on how many layers of complexity you'd like to include. Fantastic game for large groups if you purchase enough expansions so that everyone can have a plane.

Appears to be getting better with more planes in the mix through the expansions

The problem is taht each player really needs their own manoever deck, which doesn't really happen.

Acquired March 2005 in BGG trade.  Very simple mechanics result in a fast playing, fun little game that moves quickly while keeping a sense of air combat.  The planes have very different performance characteristics which can help or hender you and are a big part of the strategy.  All in all a solid game that was well recieved and has a good chance of jumping up to an 8.

RATING: 5
Original little game with elegant, simple rules. Too bad the airplane cards are so fiddly to use on any smooth surface: You should really play this on a carpet to avoid accidentaly moving the cards. Moving a card even a few millimetres can have quite an impact on the outcome of the dogfights! Also, game length can vary greatly: With four planes it could all be over in 30 minutes, but at one time we had to call it quits after two hours of play. I guess, however, that could be true of all guessing games in which you have to guess right in order to score points.

RATING: 6
Clever design, planning manuevers directly  rather than plotting hex by hex.  Seems a bit of a one-trick pony, though, and needs more scenarios/objectives than just dogfighting.  Worth some plays though.  Make sure you have a cloth surface to play on, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoyed it alot.  I actually like the system better than other minatures I have dabbled in.  There's a satisfying feeling to how the manuver cards control the plane.  Playing the game felt like dogfighting, and that's the way it should feel.

Played once at Kids Day at Game Night Games. Intriguing setup. Similar to Crimson Skies and Top Gun (both games I have played). I do like the idea of project three manuveurs out at a time. This both increases the game play time while adding a bit of 'DOH!' factor. My son quite enjoyed blowing me out of the sky.

Fantastic game system and mechanism. Remind me of the good old child days when playing on the floor with my toy planes. It is possible to play all from very simple games to very complex war games and it works fine - at least for us - to play without the miniature planes and just use the plane cards. You can easily create your own scenarios and campaigns and add new home-made components if you like (I do!). Only downside is that you quickly want to have all the expansions but I will recommend you to spend your money on them before starting to collect the miniature planes - the game works very well without having them (the miniature planes)

You need more then two people. I don't get the expansion system at all, what do you need to buy to be able to play this game?

RATING: 6
Great concept; easy to set-up and get started, plays well with lots of players. There are rules on-line for energy conservation which make the game a lot better.  Anyone who has ever flown a plane knows that the biggest weakness for most air combat simulations is the lack of rules about energy conservation.

I'm not much for miniature games or war games, and this seems to be a blend of both.  I will give the game credit for capturing the sense and feel of a warplane dogfight, though.

Very fast and simple filler, with game mechanics that do a lot to immerse the player in the aerial dogfighting theme. Very well done, with all the different planes having very different characteristics. Really good for two players, even better with more.

RATING: 6
A very lightweight and simplistic approach to the dogfighting concept. Granted, you can learn it in 5 mins, but it doesn't feel like you have a lot to do in the game, just pick some cards and flip them.

Would have been considerably better if the "dakka" was delivered through dice.

This is a miniatures-like combat game.  This is described as a simplified Robo Rally, which may be too true, in the sense that it's not as fun.  Maybe it's sour grapes on my part with only one play -- playing a five-player game in which I kept to myself at the far end of the table while the rest of the players shot it out.  Once I engaged, I got shot for three hits, took two points of damage and drew an instant-death card.  I don't appreciate any you-lose-instantly cards (nor you-win-instantly cards) in any game, because it makes playing the game completely pointless.  Perhaps it would be fun with that card taken out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fantastic WWI dogfighting game that plays quick and provides a very satisfying air combat experience. I strongly recommend getting the miniatures for this, as they really make the game pop.

The designers did a very good job making all the planes feel different, even though they are fighting in two dimensions. (You can actually play with altitude rules, but they really bog the game down and add very little to the experience.) This game absolutely buried Crimson Skies for me and I have never looked back.

RATING: N/A
What a ridiculous set of components. Absurd to have these huge and entirely unnecessary playing mats printed on thick stock, while the planes themselves are ordinary cards and have all kinds of problems if not played on a thick cloth or carpet. And let's see: five mats, each of which could've instead been 8-10 planes...absolute no-brainer. The A/B/C/D issue is bizarre, but the notion that you would do this with the *only component that must remain stable and durable* is so utterly weird I suspect massive drug use or clinical insanity over at Nexus.

Oh, the game? Definitely original and creative, but...I think I'm just not a minis gamer. The little ambiguities annoy, the possibility of running away into endless space, the lack of clean structure all press the wrong buttons for me.

Clean dynamics, and the miniatures give the full 3D perspective.  Simple approach without the headache of casualty percentagce grids.

For a more realistic odds for jammed guns, we draw two cards for all rages.  Long range makes lowers card damage, medeum range makes highest card damage, and close range makes total card damage.  You think twice before shooting at long range.

I really like this game.  I love the planning, the theme is fantastic.

I dislike the fact the games are so short.  I've played with a maximum of 4.

I also dislike the fact the cards warp too easily and become tops on a smooth playing surface.  It does get a bit frustrating especially when two planes overlap.

Overall an 8 on concept and design but a 6 on implementation.  And because I like it a little more than a 7...

Played a 2-on-2 game tonight, which ended on a mutual kill on  a head-on pass. I think the minis actually just make this game fiddlier - the cards play better. But the minis do LOOK good...Simple rules, a bit confusing when you play more than one aircraft each, but a good game.

The game plays very well for all the apparent simplicity of it.  A lot more depth is in the detail provided by the maneuver cards than you would assume from first glance.

The damage model is interesting - it certainly provides a lot of "flavor" - but could be accurately pointed at as a weak spot in the system.  It really is quite random, and doesn't handle variations in how aircraft take damage very well...essentially, damage is allocated randomly based on the weapon firing AT you, and the only difference in HOW the damage effects an aircraft is in how many points it can take before being destroyed.

Like the combat rules, but movement often lead to a lot of LOS misses and dead rounds when only two planes were alive. Started great with four planes, and would probably be great with four teams of two, but once the board cleared a bit we circled for a while.

3-player was much more enjoyable but we still used two planes each. I'd probably always prefer 3 or 4 players with two planes each to keep the board crowded and the action happening.

RATING: 7
Honestly, I never thought a fighter plane miniature game could be this much fun.  The massive 11-player Wings of War session I participated in was a riot.  There were plenty of taunting and trash talking from the two opposing sides, as each of us trying to outmanuever the other to gain the best attacking position.  I love the interaction between everyone, coordinating our offensive efforts as well as giving defensive suggestions to those that are tagged or surrounded.  The ability to step back and visualize the fight as you survey the action on the tabletop was an exhilirating sight to behold.

Even so, there were things during the game that was somewhat frustrating.  The movement phase with the cards was fairly clever, and it required strategic planning due to the simultaneous action between all players.  However, the actual execution of it was less than elegant.  It was impossible to be precise, as the stand that holds the miniature often gets knocked over or moved as everyone trying to shift their plane to its next position.  Often two or more of them will overlap near the same spot, which would then cause additional problems.  Without a question the miniatures are an essential part of the gameplay, it added so much flavor into the game, but the fiddling around required is also what bogs down the session.

Then there was the damage cards, the randomness of how it was dealt was pretty annoying, especially when someone who got shot a dozen times only has accumulated 4 points compared to your 10 from two shots received.  Part of me wished that there would be more to assigning damage than just down to the luck of the draw, but that will probably make the game unnecessarily longer.

Disclaimer: I'm pretty sure we played with a bunch of expansions, so uncertain which one I should be rating, I decided to just choose the base game itself.

This is a very nice design all over. I particularly liked how the designers paid homage to a lot of predecessors, not the least Blue Max which was insanely fun. It is a light family game to a large extent, but with strategy enough for av avid gamer to get the upper hand. Personally I would consider it a little bit too light for my taste. I am not that enthusiastic about the collector part of it, even if the models of the planes are nice.

RATING: 7
It is a good little game with a couple of problems. 1- With one box it's not possible to create varied matches, they are always the same planes fighting each other. 2- The special damage rules are poorly designed: not only they are hard and not elegant to track, but also increase the weight of luck. Fortunately, you can forfeit weapon jams, engine damages and fire by simply ignoring the figure on the cards, taking just the numbers into consideration.

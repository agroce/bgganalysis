Dog is a pleasant mix of Parcheesi and Sorry and is usually played as a 2 on 2 team game.  It's a lot of fun!

RATING: 2
Played one 6-player game, which fell short of it's promise of being short. Had multiple problems unrelated to the game play, including having 3 or 4 rules wrong and corrected during the game ON MY TURN.

Reminds me of a euro version of Sorry, but longer and more drawn out. Our game lasted an agonizing hour and a half, with most of that time being spent sitting and waiting for people to decide on cards while I had no legal cards to play.

I first noticed and played this on BSW. I enjoyed it and thought it would be a good purchase for my family gaming.  We’ve only played it twice and it’s gone over ok so far. I’m not sure if it’s going to get played a lot or get dusty on the shelf. I enjoy it, so I’ll push for it to be played and I can’t see any objections to it coming to the table as of yet. The Schmidt Spiele version I’ve got, for me the board is a little small and with sweaty fingers it’s hard to let go of your small, light pieces on the correct spot. I’d like to make my own board for these reasons. 

UPDATE: Turned out this is one has become one of my most played games. Me and my partner play against her friend and partner nearly every time they visit. It’s become quite a hit with us both.

UPDATE: This game just gets better and better! Played a 6 player game last night, it took a while but what a laugh.

RATING: 9
Played about 15-20 times now on BSW and I can certainly see why people might not care for this one.  But I totally dig these kind of games, the ones that mix a little thinking with a lot of luck.  Make it a partnership game, and I'm in heaven.

It's light - it's more Sorry! or Trouble than it is Pachesi (and full disclosure: I really like Trouble) - and yet there's definitely some neat hand management stuff, and more than enough room for some clever play.  But, yeah, there's also a boatload of luck.

At about 30-40 minutes, it does feel a little long for what it is.  I think a lot of that comes from the both-partners-are-jointly-moving-one-last-single-pawn endgame, which isn't nearly as satisfying as the midgame.  The middle 70% is where all the fun is, I think.  And also where most of the "cool" decisions are, though since it is partnership, it can be tough if your partner misses some move you were setting up, or doesn't pass you the "obvious" card.

When you're way behind, you still have a chance, yet good early play is definitely rewarded - the game strikes the right balance between the two.  And did I mention it's a partnership game?

*** UPDATE October 2009 [initial rating:8] ***

Well, with another 75+ plays under my belt, this game continues to delight me.  The middle is still the meat, but the endgame (now that I really know what I'm doing) is just as tricky and fun and satisfying.  And that pawn-on-its-own-color-blocks rule is GENIUS.

Bought 5 or 6 from Amazon.de, and after bringing the game out at a local event, I've had to fight people off who want copies.  That's a pretty good sign.

A take on Pachisi  with a take that element and random card draws. There's a partnership mechanic that could be interesting, but it seemed that you can just lose the game based on what cards you are given.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A "racing" game with card based turns.

Move your figures around the board to bring them "home". Various cards let your figures move and if played in the right situation, abeles it to take other players figures back to their starting position


If you like Parcheesi or "Mensch Ärgere Dich nicht", you might like Dog.

I play the game a lot with my family. 
2 Player "Tag Team"-Games are a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Pachisi is one of the games I despise the most, for there’s nothing appealing in it but an endless source of annoyance and boredom: with my astonishment I found that Dog manages to even worsen that feeling, since it takes out the only diversion in the game (rolling the dice) and replaces it with a bunch of cards, thus trying to make an obnoxious euro out of an irritating abstract.

The Schmidt version looks flashy and cheap, but the Swiss one locks great. Now THIS is a good filler game. Of course there is luck, and no small portion of it, but there are also meaningful decisions to make, a lot of interaction and generally lots of fun. I prefer to play with 4 players, 6 feels too chaotic and random.

Little if any improvement over Sorry! and Parchesi, except that it's played in partnerships.  Luck of the cards is almost the only thing that matters.  To be fair, there is a small amount of tactical card play.  Takes way too long to play.

This game suffers from a pretty obvious flaw:  if you don't get any cards that allow you to start pieces, you sit there doing nothing.   It is very easy for one team to get a lot fewer of these cards, making this a pretty random game.

RATING: 7
One wouldn't think a cross between Sorry and Pacheesi would be too exciting, but I actually had a good time playing this one!

One thing that makes Dog slightly more interesting is that you are playing in partnerships, so you're always looking out for your partner's interests as well as your own.  You also get to pass your partner a card at the beginning of each round, which helps keep players suffering from crappy draws, as your partner will hopefully pass you a useful card.  Otherwise, the game is much the same as its parent games with the addition of a few extra types of cards and a couple rule changes.

So really nothing special here.  However, for some reason, I just plain enjoy playing it!

RATING: 7
By adding team play and eschewing dice for cards, an annoying old random-based game is suddenly transformed into something fun and interesting. How strange.

Fast game. Some tactical decisions to be made, but not too thinkey. Good as a filler, but I could play it five times in a row too. Must try this with my colleagues at work.

Amazing how replacing dice with cards and adding team partners can turn the abysmal, almost decisionless "Mensch ärgere dich nicht" into an average game.
I like team games (see the 12th general preference about games in my profile)!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It certainly improves on Parcheesi / Sorry, but also needlessly carries over a number of things from those games that I find arbitrary and annoying.

I like the partnership, the use of cards instead of dice, the swapping, the 'if you can move you must', the 'may move backwards' card, and that you can't just set up a blockade anywhere on the path. I dislike the use of required cards to bring a piece into play, that while you only have one piece in play your choices are very limited, that some cards are immensely powerful (7s, I'm looking at you) while most are just movement, and that blockades can still last long enough to bring one player's game to a boring halt-state. (With some prayer of involvement due to partner-passing and the "swap pieces" card, but still.)

RATING: 4.5
Dog is a partnership variant of Parcheesi, Sorry, or trouble, but with added depth.  It has some interesting strategies mixed into the massive amounts of luck.  It would probably be fun with 4 players, but I recommend against playing it with 6 players.  Our game went on for an hour and a half.  It was fun for the first half hour, tolerable for the next half hour, and aggravating for the last half hour (even though we ended up winning).

Here are the two things that I dislike the most about the game:

- There are times when you have no legal move, so you simple discard your hand and watch other people play.  This happened to my partner on the first hand of the game. It seemed really silly.  My solution would be to say that any card allows you to move your pawn out of the starting space. 

- The game can technically go on FOREVER, and our game almost did.  I will never again play DOG with 6 players.  It took a long time between turns, and then it went on for 1.5 hours!  This game should be a 30 minute game.

My guess is that my rating would go up by a point if I played it with 4 players.

RATING: 10
Light, fun partnership game. A game this simple should not be this good. 

8 to 9: I really enjoy the nostalgia factor Dog brings to the table. The game I probably played the most of growing up was Trouble, and although I'm not going to be busting out the pop-o-matic bubble any time soon, Dog is a great replacement. Sure the game has some problems - bad draws can ruin a team's chances, the game can drag towards the end, but considering these problems I'm still enthralled with a game the combines my favorite youth game with partner play and good choices. If you enjoyed Trouble or Parcheesi growing up, but your tastes are a little more refined these days, consider Dog a viable game. 

9 to 10: What started as a 'Tichu for beginners' interest in Dog has blossomed into a true love for the game. Is it less complicated as Tichu? Yes, but it's still rather deep and more importantly FUN! This partnership game is my new go to game for couples. And again, unlike Tichu, I would suspect that beginners would have a chance against experienced players. Sure, the game favors experienced players, but beginners will have some sort of a chance. I don't think I could say the same for Tichu. Plus, what to do to help your partner is often very obvious. 

I regret the fact that I can't find 4 people in real life who enjoy this game nearly as much as I do.

Yes, it looks like Pachisi. Yes, even the objectives are the same. No, it doesn't play like Pachisi at all.

Dog is a team game where players try to get their pawns home before the opposition does. Instead of rolling dice, pawns are moved using playing cards, and most cards provide special actions instead of just "move X spaces". This allows for a lot more control and tactical play.

In the right setting (ie. casual play with a couple of friends) Dog is lots of fun and it might be the perfect gateway game for people who don't know any games beyond Pachisi and Monopoly.

This game is a deceptively simple looking partner game where you get to do nasty things to your opponents from time to time. Saying it is a Pachisi varient doesn't really help - this game is to Pachisi as playing Clue is to actually murdering someone.

Rating (10) for Brändi version.
Rating (8) for Schmidt edition.

Excellent family game!  I love it, my kids love it and my kids' friends love it, too.

Comes in two versions:

The German edition by Schmidt is rather low-priced (~18 Euro) with decent card quality.  The board and bits however are sub-optimal because you can very easily knock your pawns over.

The Swiss edition by Brändi has a really high price (50-60 Euro) because the game is produced by handicapped people. It is however of far superior quality: a thick, polished wood board with beautiful marbles as pawns. Knocking over the bits is virtually impossible here.  Standard cards are used which might be a slight disantvantage when playing with young children.  

All in all I definitely prefer the Brändi version: it's beautiful, robust and by buying it you support the work of handicapped people.

Have you played Ludo? This time work in pairs !

This is a more fun version of Ludo. Players are give 6,5,4,3,2 cards each turn and repeat this process. On each turn, teammates swap 1 card and play the cards they have. Cards can be from 1-13 and careful there are some special powers which can bump your opponent back to their home and they wasted their entire time circling the circuit !

A very easy game to learn and fun for the family !

After one game of Dog, I thought it had some interesting things going for it, and would probably rate it around 5 or 6.  Then I played my second game of Dog, in which I had the misfortune to not draw any cards that would let me get my pieces into play for three rounds in a row.  My partner had the same problem for the first two rounds, and only got one in the third round, so she still couldn't pass one to me.  True, this is highly improbable.  That doesn't change the fact that we both missed the first 11 turns of the game, and I missed the first 15.  I find this an inexcusable flaw in the rules.  At the very least, a player should be able to escape one of their pieces when forced to pass a round, so as to make certain they never have to skip two rounds in a row.  Or _something_.  I might play again with some house rule, but I can't see myself ever playing again with rules as written.

After 4 plays, this game has really grown on me.

A fun little game, Sorry done right.  It can be really frustrating if you don't get dealt any start cards and you sit out the whole round, but the game moves quickly enough that you'll probably get one the next round, unless you're extremely unlucky or your partner is not paying attention.  The partnership aspect of the game is what makes this tolerable, and even interesting.  The endgame is kind of fun, though I could see how it could theoretically outstay its welcome.  Playing with AP-sufferers would be a no no.

I remembered it as a fun game, but when I played recently you really felt how antiquated it was. I didn't get a card to come out the first 5 rounds and my partner didn't have one either or 1 maximum, so I wasn't really playing for 65% of the game. At least the other team got good cards and it was over fast. Not keen on playing again soon.

Dog has several small differences compared to Sorry's often overlooked partnership + adult rules, but the games aren't radically different. A couple of Dog's differences are noteworthy improvements: passing cards and a protected start.

The two-point BGG rating gap makes me wonder if Sorry is rated for its worst variant (kids' rules) while Dog, which also includes a much less interesting non-partnership variant, is rated for its best.

RATING: 4
Lives up to its reputation as "Sorry, but with cards", and suffers from the same "Oh I guess I can't play for the next 5 turns because RNG hates me" bearing-off problems.

Gets a _slight_ boost on account of strategically walling other players from travelling past your home by sitting in the spawn tile.

Fun simple couples game, that everyone's familiar with with their childhood tribulations with Trouble! or Sorry! or some such inferior game. Recommended: get prospective players past the game's name, emphasize that no dice are involved, and tell them it's the national sport of Switzerland (they won't bother to check) and you'll have a good time with this.

Sure it's a souped-up version of Trouble but it's fun.  I enjoy the partner aspect, hand management and card-passing.  Solid filler for 4.  Haven't tried the 6 player version but sounds fun if not a bit crazy.

Very luck dependent, but also easy to explain and quite fun. Would be nice to have slightly more team actions (used: passing one card per round, playing 7s moves also on team-mates pieces, playing team-mates pieces when done yourself).

Negative: Having to skip a round with many cards (4-6) when the team has no king, ace, or joker but you have no active pawns. Were discussing an optional rule of allowing to pass the entire round but as a consolation getting one piece on start.

The Brändi Dog (1997) version is really pretty.

This was quite a treat to play, and a surprise to enjoy! I was skeptical of the look and design of the game as it looks like your basic Parcheesi or Sorry! board but I was delighted to learn you control your pawns' movement with cards from your hand, not dice! The other wonderful aspect of this game was the cooperative partnership, making the experience much more like a card game of Spades or Hearts. I was immediately in love with the mechanics of the game, calculating moves, crossing my fingers that my competitors wouldn't block or send my pawns flying back home. Dog is a full on tactical game with very little given to chance. It's a blast to play! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's Sorry being played in teams, with each round a descending number of cards being played (increasing the luck) but with a card swap between players (reducing the luck). Which are inspired design decisions because the game is definitely more interesting and fun with a partner to enjoy it with. There's a couple of other minor twists, but all the main features remain - moving pawns around the board, start cards, swap cards, backwards cards. The Sorry pedigree ain't a great base to work from in a game sense, so the game is never going to reach stellar heights, but the improvements lend it an air of respectability that drags the game into playable heights at the least.

Needs good strategy and team work to win, as it's not a luck game! I recommend it to have fun with your friends.

But, this is obviously a better version of Pachisi.

Dog -- 

Played once; four-player.

From what I had read, [thing=2633]Dog[/thing] is [thing=2136]Parcheesi[/thing]/[thing=2407]Sorry![/thing]/[thing=1410]Trouble[/thing] done right, so I was looking forward to the experience.

But in the first turn, the opposing team (Rich and Eric) were sharply disadvantaged.  Rich couldn't release any of his tokens in either turn, and Eric only did so once.  Meanwhile, John and I could hardly have fared better than we did.  I got two of my tokens to my target area in the first two turns. (Or was it three turns?)  And John got one of his tokens to finish, as well.  Furthermore, we continued to draw really useful cards, while Rich's tokens never managed to stay away from home for long.  

I realized quickly that the game [i]would[/i] balance out once the range of numbers required to land a token in the target area was reduced to one, but I still had a hard time enjoying the game while Rich was facing so much bad luck.  (I felt guilty that I was enjoying how inordinately luck was favoring me while it was thwarting Rich.)

Still, the game [i]did[/i] last long enough that it [i]did[/i] balance out.  It actually lasted a little too long for its weight, but once the game got going (read: we [i]all[/i] were playing), I really enjoyed it, so the duration didn't reach the point of bothering me.  

I especially enjoyed the partnership aspect.  The card-passing mechanic added a nice element of communication between partners, and often allowed us to ensure that our partners had the right cards at the right moments.  During the midgame it was nice to have someone out there on your side (trying to [i]not[/i] send your tokens home).  But it was in the endgame that the partnership aspect shined — once I had finished with all four of my tokens, I was able to help John with his tokens.

We played the Schmidt Spiele edition, and the card stock was very good quality, and the iconography made their functions intuitive.  

The play itself was intuitive, comfortably familiar, and (at the end) surprisingly tense.

It looks like Sorry and if you read the rules it seems that it should play like Sorry, but once it gets going feels like a fantastic partnership card game.  Lots of fun to be had here. 

UPDATE: I have to say that I think the Question Marks are too powerful.  I also think the game drags too long at the end when you just have one piece running round and around waiting to get a question mark.  I'm interested in trying this where you end the game with 4 and 3 in rather than all in and ditching the question marks entirely.

RATING: 7
Player each have 4 pawns, in the home space. Play in rounds where you're dealt 6 cards, then 5 then 4 then 3, then start over at 6. First, pass your partner a card. Then on your turn, play a card: need 1/11, 13, or wild to leave home and enter the board; then move forward as many spaces as the card you play. If you land on someone, send them back home.

There are several special cards:
- 7: movement can be split amongst several of your pieces.
- 4: allows movement forward or backward. The goal is to get your pieces clockwise around the board, and then to the end spaces (with exact movement).
- 1/11: either 1 or 11
- a card that allows you to trade positions with any other pawn on the board.
- wild: can be ANY other card

If one player's pieces are all in their end area, their partner's will be playing to help them! Your pieces may only enter the end area if they are coming from the spaces prior to (counterclockwise from) your entering space, so your token can either travel the full circuit around the board, or move backwards past the starting space! Those two little rules, plus the card exchange at the start of each round, really make the game much more fun and interesting than you would think from a game that is "just like Sorry"! We'll have to get the travel version, which looks really cool!

This game is Sorry! but with a partner and no slides. I like the partner mechanic and feel that it plays a little better than Sorry!, but it's essentially the same game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is very similar to Sorry, except it is played with 4 players divided into 2 two-person teams, and it is played with a hand of cards to choose from and you pass a card to your teammate. Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as you try to get your piece out of the starting area, around the board, and safe at home, including bumping opponents back to their starting area along the way, and avoiding getting bumped yourself. It's certainly better than Sorry as there are some decisions to be made along the way, and of course everything is better with teams, but there's not quite enough there to get this one particularly high up my interest list, especially given the stiff competition for table time.

Great card game. There is more than it meets the eye here. A lot of strategies are workable. The rules are a pain. Neither the official site nor the file here in the BGG has the complete rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Dog is essentially Sorry! with a bit more strategy. There are a few tweaks. It's a partnership game. Start cards are 1/11 and 13. There's a wild "anything" card. You have a hand of cards each round. You pass a card to your partner at the start of the round. A player's pawn on their start space can't be passed. Etc.

There is almost no art in the game. The only visual reference to canines is a paw print in the O of Dog. And other than the name of the game, there's little to let you know that it's supposed to be about dogs. The rulebook refers to your start space as your kennel... which I guess is thematic? So we're dogs trying to get home? But if we land on another player we send them back to their kennel? So we're canine dog-catchers? They put so little effort into the theme I'm surprised they bothered at all. Apparently there's an advanced version of the game, Dog Royal, which adds the specialized player pieces king, knight, citizen, jester... 'cause you know... dogs.

The changes from Sorry! make it more interesting than that game, but it's not a game I would particularly seek out.

Homemade copy with Aggravation board and cards from four decks so that all special cards are red and all numbers are only black.

A hidden gem! We've all played Parcheesi/Sorry/Aggravation, but not like this.  They threw out the dice and added playing cards and teams.  With a full group of six this game is a blast.  Luck is a factor, but strategy and teamwork counts for a lot.  If you want a family game or introduce folks to what a game could be (it's as if they purposely made Sorry boring) check this one out.  If you don't want to make your own copy you can buy from Amazon.de or sometimes timewellspent carries it.

A good team vs team game. Each player has 4 color specific pawns and the point is to take your's around the board ending back in your base while preventing the other team's pawns from doing so. The first team to have their pawns in their bases wins. Simple card play for moving and some special actions make this game a good choice that works great with non gamers.

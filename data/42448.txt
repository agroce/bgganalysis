Full of randomness, but that's the exact design of the game.  Feel like it will go the same way as CAH, i.e. great at start, but the more you play, the less enthused about playing it you become.

Can be used with the base game or as a stand alone expansion.  More of the same fun, but with a different flavor.

RATING: 10
Love it.  10 because it's even more stupid (i.e. "stupider") than the first one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
very silly.
very abrupt.

we had more fun with a 2player variant when we gave everyone a specific number of "lives" so they could add/remove from the count when the win/lose.  when someone loses all lives, they are actual out of the game.  This makes game last longer and more fun.  Also whatever cards made a player win, would be discarded after the win is tracked.

I have a feeling the variant above would be fun as a drinking game, instead of a "number of lives" approach, have someone drink when they "lose" and have everyone else drink when you "win".

can be fun and funny with the right people.

I cannot believe that after 20 plays I still want to play it more. So stupid, so funny, so random, so quick and I don't know why I still love it.

Adding the blue cards is a unique mechanic which I liked as well as more cards for the normal deck good mix up and a life line in the blue cards in certain situation where you are likely to lose or a the complete opposite and a useless fish

Much of the same as the base game, though it does add in the all important alternate to 'cake or death'.

My comment for this expansion will be brief, because this is basically just more of the exact same as the base game. All it adds is variety. I love that variety, because when we start playing this it's hard to stop. It's also worth noting that this is perfectly playable without the original base game.

I'm a big fan of the base game so I picked up this expansion and mixed it in. Sadly it turns out that I don't like this expansion at all. There are too many new elements with long text to read, and the deck becomes uncomfortably gigantic. Also, our games often finished before the first round even ended (something that happens occasionally in the base game, but seemed to happen far too much with the expansion). I sorted out all the cards, leaving in only the much-needed second 'Cake or Death' card, and haven't touched the rest of the deck since.

Más cartas para el Playtest! El problema es que si juegas con la expansión, vas a mezclar las cartas... y luejo separarlas es casi imposible. O las divides y au. Es mejor comprar una caja de magic y meter ahí el básico y la expansión. Ojo que la expansión añade un poco de complejidad al juego, si lo que te gusta es la simpleza del juego base, puede que este no te termine de convencer. Si lo que te gusta es el absurdismo... Tarta!

The same game, with slightly different cards. Or, if you own the original, more cards. Playable standalone, which is certainly a plus.

RATING: 5
This game is forgettable though I suppose it fills its purpose. As a filler, the game is lacking, but it's not a filler; it's a super-filler meant to fill 10 or even 5 minutes while you wait for someone. You can do this activity while you wait and have a few laughs doing so. Though you could just as easily have a conversation.

This was kind of dull. It's a filler game, there's really no point to it, and the game length varies too much.

Doesn't do much to add to the zany fun of the original but if you play the first you must own this one too.  It's written in the rule book that you must buy this one.

RATING: 3
Played with 5 players. During several game, the 5th player never got to play a card because a player starting before him/her won the game.
The 11 year old girl at the table loved it. It is not even a filler since games last 27 seconds on average. You might as well each roll a dice, highest roll wins, re-roll ties. For a change, lowest roll wins. By the way, such die rolls are common text on the cards of this game. So, nope. Not fun.

Much better than the original, though we usually mix them together.  Kind of a whack-a-doodle version of Fluxx - more madcap and silly feeling. And that's not bad! It's a good time-killer/filler game for lighthearted gaming in between heavier games. We do have a lot better filler games to choose from, though, so it hasn't been played since my sister bought it.

A little disappointing to be honest. The "You win" cards are funny the first time, frustrating the second. The game felt like we couldn't even really get started before the game ends. Maybe the expansions (when they eventually arrive) will fix this. I'm all for short games, but this didn't allow us time to enjoy it before starting over. For now, it gets a 3.

Bought from The Game Preserve the same day I bought the original game, because we had so much fun playing the original over dinner.

The cards are too small. Really. It's hard to shuffle these together with the cards from We Didn't Playtest This At All, and if you hold the resulting deck loosely by the ends and shake it, all the expansion cards will drop out on the table.

At the same time, they're too big, because just like the other cards, they don't quite fit in a standard plastic card box.

Works well with the "no testing" theme, I guess.

The title pretty much says it all. The game could easily end in an instant. If you love "random" games, then this one is for you. A word of caution though, some games end rather fast which can easily turn people off - actually, the game is sometimes so short (and pointless) that many people will never want to play it again (there is absolutely no variety as the game will usually end always in the same way).

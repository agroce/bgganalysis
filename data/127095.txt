Very nicely themed game which has a good level of playability and decision making. Bought this on spec at Essen and very pleased I did. A question about the use of specific action card - that allowed you to Swap with another player's tribe pawn of superior size - but everything else seemed pretty clear. Didn't feel abstract to me - more like a middle weight euro with beautiful playing pieces. Recommended if you like this sort of thing.

This is very light-weight in terms of strategy - we are in the realms of Takenoko here. It looks stunning with beautiful wooden pieces - I have rarely seen a more attractive game. The rules are very forgiving - players pick up points from doing just about anything - but it works seamlessly. This would be perfect for families or casual gamers.

A tail-wagging puppy of a game that just begs to be loved.   The poster paint colours of a stylized world map and the charming wooden figures are a large part of that.  There is also a degree of thematic fidelity in its simple mechanics, with humanity evolving, stronger evolutionary branches muscling out the weak and nomadic tribes wandering the globe.  Origin is quick and pleasant to play.  Yet I do have a few reservations.  Some early momentum seems critical; saddle yourself at the start with time-consuming objectives through bad luck or stupidity and you will lose as others churn through the objective deck.  Also, I suspect some imbalances between player options (evolve happened a lot more than move or swap) and the benefits on the permanent cards.  

Production quality is to Matagot's usual very high standards.

WARNING: I am part of Matagot - You must judge if I'm fair !

Finally ready, after 5 years and many, many, many trials...

It's now by far my favourite light game (I'm a reasonable hardcore players).
There is a bit of luck so that it remains a true family game but much less than Takenoko or River Dragons for example. I build plans within plans optimize minor choices hoping for the right combination of events and take satisfaction when they occur. My wife still has her fun playing cards as they come and grabing points wherever she finds them.

The junior version, which is quite different in the end from the original game, is striking the difficult balance so that our little daughter and older son can play together.

Finally, I love to look at the board at the end of the game too.

----------------------
The game works, but it's just not much fun.  It felt like Takenoko, but with the players having much less control.  The game has pretty cool pieces, and a neat theme, but I wasn't having very much fun during the game.  Something I'd be willing to play again, but not something I am looking to explore more.

One play with three players. Visually stunning game with a reasonable game underneath that won't wow players with its mechanisms but is still a joy to play.

I love the theme, look, and idea of this game. It's also quite engaging, with some interesting decisions to make while also being very casual and quick. I'd almost call it a "filler" if the set-up and take-down were slightly shorter.

I do think one central rule breaks the game, and that's the ability to draw a new pink scoring card right after you've scored a different one. This makes going for the pink cards far more valuable than wasting the time and effort going for spears/orange special powers. We house rule the game so that you can't draw a new pink card unless you actually land on a pink spot.

Normally, I dislike point salad games. However, while this game is most definitely point salad, I find it very enjoyable to play. The theme goes a long way, humanity spreading across the globe is a great little idea. Plus, evolution being able to go back and forth along the colour line is a great touch. There's a fantastic anti-racist message in there. The physical aesthetics certainly play a part, I mean, those wooden pawns are simply incredible looking and feeling. However, I suspect it is the broken nature of the cards (very Chudyk) that you can base your strategy around and the constant presence of private Objectives to strive for, that make it shine as a game.

Meh. I guess it’s an okay medium-light game, but it just didn’t feel very inspiring to me. It certainly didn’t help that some of the goal cards seemed quite… Unbalanced. I’m usually a sucker for secret objectives, but it didn’t really work too well in this game I think. Maybe it was because it was the first game among three of us, but we all kind of agreed. There are also other cards, not objective cards, available, but while some seem quite strong some were weak. 

The differently sized pawns were an innovative twist, but it didn’t really do too much. We didn’t play with the dice as that would only have increased the amount of randomness. There are a couple of different ways to score VPs on, and while you do have to plan ahead, the game was a little too boring. Would try it again, though, just to be sure.

RATING: 7.5
Way more engaging and interesting than I thought it would be (have to admit I bought based on looks...). It's fast but with just enough decisions to keep it interesting. Every turn is about maximising points - there's no real build up, you're thrown into it from the first turn which my group (4 players) has really enjoyed. 
The production values are outstanding - just playing with the wooden figures alone makes it worth breaking out from time to time. And this would make it a good one to introduce to non-gamers.
This isn't going to replace your Advanced Civ, but if you're looking for a light, quick, area control game with a whiff of civ-building then this is a great addition.

An abstract at heart, but the card play turns it into a true Civ-lite game. Some players seem to be struck by analysis paralysis, but I'm known as a relatively slow player and I spent the other players' turns simply hoping that at least one of my possible next moves would still be available. Now that we know what we're doing, I can see this playing very quickly.

Not super-deep, but when played quickly it's good fun. It may see a lot of play. I will probably adjust the rating up or down accordingly.

Got a second-hand copy that was missing all the cards, and missing two pawns! Unplayable!

[-]So disappointed; was looking forward to divining the strategies of the game, and its a beautiful game to look at. Light strategy that could encompass my gamer friends and my children.

Can't pull a PNP to get it to work; can't sell it. It's a sad situation. :([/-]

UPDATE: Contacted Matagot, they sold me the missing pieces and cards! Game saved! :D But still no insert. Gonna try crafting that one eventually.

Origin is a beautiful abstract game where these wonderful wooden statues of varying colour and height and thickness take over a world map. You have hidden objectives and other ways of scoring VPs, none of which are terribly taxing on the brain. But for a half hour game you get a fair amount of value and it really does look and feel very splendid indeed.

One issue is that toward game end the objective cards become over-swingy as in Takaenoko style you can find you have already completed one from the random draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The game is sadly really abstract, interaction between players are rather small and it was kinda boring. Moreover, the objective cards are really too powerful as they are random: each time you finish one, you receive a new one. If you're lucky like me, the new one is already (or almost) finished then you can score again. I ended the game with so many more points than other players that I suspect this part being a possible problem. Even without that, the game was not fun at all for us :(

Love at first rules read through, and it didn't dissapoint upon playing.  It's an easy game to learn, but you can devote a lot of thought to it and be well rewarded.  

This game is all about finagling pieces into the right position on the board in order to score your cards.  Once you have a grasp on the scoring cards it's pretty easy to set yourself up.  The technologies can be used to create some fun combos for scoring as well.  

There are some great painful moments when someone nabs the pawn you want or takes the space you want with a really thick dude that you won't be able to swap with.

Fantastic game with any player count, but best with four.

Origin has some strange things working in its favor. The strange Evolution mechanic used for placing pawns of the board is quite weird, but facilitates creativity in blocking the expansion of other players. Additionally, the strength and movement traits offer varying utility based on the player's goals. Go tall for flexible play, or go strong to better control the board. Unfortunately, these points of interest fail to unify into anything of note, because they simply don't play a strong enough role in the game. Instead, the game is centered around Objective cards, that are so narrowly focused that they guide the hands of the players, robbing them of their agency.

Very interesting with at least 3 players, best with 4. The goal cards will determine your strategy & tactical choices, but it is all pretty levelled out, often providing a close battle in which that one tiny misstep could prove to be costing those crucial points. The end result makes a beautiful picture as well. Not a heavyweight, but surely a topnotch family game !

8/10 with only 2 players.

6/10 for the Junior game, in which it is too important to just obtain 2 sets of 5 cards.

5/10 for the Junior game with just 2 players.

A játékban az emberiség kialakulását és a Föld benépesedését játszhatjuk végig.
A kivitelezés a szokásos Matagot minőség, azaz messze kiemelkedik az átlagból. Kb. 2 kilónyi, szépen megmunkált fafigura van a dobozban, egy világtérkép - aminek kicsit minimál, vízfesték-szerű a designja - plusz jópár kártya, nagyon szép grafikákkal.

Viszonylag egyszerű, elemi akciókra van lehetőséged a körökben:
1. Szaporodhatsz: afrika közepéről indulva, benépesíthetjük a földet. Ezt a fafigurákkal tesszük. Figurából három féle színű, három féle magasságú és három féle erejű van, minden kombinációban. Egy új figurát úgy tudsz letenni, ha a melette lévővel legalább két tulajdonsága megegyezik. így egyre "színesebb" lesz a lakosság.
Vagy
2. Mozoghatsz: anyit léphetsz egy figurával, amilyen magas (1-3).
Vagy
3. Elűzhetsz valakit valahonnan, aki gyengébb nálad.

Minden akcióval kapsz at adott terület színe alapján egy kártyát és/vagy egy felfedezés lapkát.

Három féle kártya van:
1. Akció: egyszer előny
2. Permanens: folyamatos előny, de bizonyos fejlettségi szint megkötéssel
3. Cél: pontszerzési lehetőség, különféle feladatok teljesítésével.

Minden kártyából kijátszhatsz még egyet az akciódon felül a körödben.

Kb. ennyi. Pont jár a végén a célkártyák után, az új kontinensek meghódítása után, vadászat után, nomeg a felfedezések után.

A játékidő kb. 45 perc.

Számunkra nagyon kellemes meglepetés volt ez a játék. Gateway kategória környékére sorolnám, bár annak inkább a tetejére. Könnyed ám mégis komoly döntések vannak benne. Az evoluciós bábupakolgatás nagyon nagy ötlet: egyrészt iszonyat tematikus, másrészt komoly kombinálgatásokat indukál. Egy játék után egy dolgot nem tudok még megmondani, hogy mennyire vannak kiegyensúlyozva a kártyák. Elsőre azért volt, ami durvána tűnt, de ehhez több játék kell, hogy kiderüljön.

Lassan már mindenki tudja, hogy az aránylag egyszerű, gyors, de mégis agyalós játékok a gyengéim. Na ez pont ilyen. Érzésem szerint kicsit kevesebb figyelmet kapott eddig, mint amennyit érdemelne.

Nálam az első játék alapján 8. 

------------

A második játék után valamennyit árnyalódott a véleményem. Sajnos vannak nagyon imba kártyák. Leginkább a másoktól cuccokat elvevősek tűnnek irreálisnak. Szerintem ezeken érdemes házi szabállyal finomítani. De így ez nálam nem lehet 8-as, csak 7-es. Kicsit fáj a szívem, mert az evoluciós alapmechaniuzmus annyira egyszerű, és annyira nagyaszerű. Jó lenne valami gémerebb játékot építeni köré, kevesebb véletlennel.

ORIGIN vereint gewohnte Strukturen eines Setz- und allerhand Punktesammelspiels. Das Besondere an ORIGIN ist die Art des Einsetzmechanismus, der sich auf die Beziehung der fulminanten, großzügig geschnitzten Holzfiguren untereinander bezieht. Dabei sind die Figuren eine Augenweide. Überhaupt ist die farbgebende Gestaltung in seiner archaischen Simplizität von überraschender Schönheit. Ein Familienspiel mit leichtem Anspruch und ein kleiner Gourmet für das Auge. Der Nachteil von ORIGIN ist, das man seine schmale Bandbreite allzu schnell ausgelotet hat.

RATING: 7
One of those few games that I've bought on looks alone. However, Origin was better than I was expecting it to be. It's nice that Matagot and the designer have included a 'Junior' edition for younger players, but this and the family fun-looking pieces makes one think that this is going to be a simple game with a lot of luck controlling the moves. While the Objective cards obviously guide how a player spreads out, there are enough decisions to be made regarding when to spread and how to spread, and whether or not it's better to go after some of the on-board objectives first. The 'evolution' system is quite nifty as well and adds a whole other layer of interest. The special power cards really allow players to get loose with the rules and also players might feel there are some overpowered cards considering what everyone has, but oddly enough this doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the game. I wouldn't even consider this a light game- maybe it's light-medium. Definitely not a filler but one you would want to play in a night where a couple of different games are being played. Origin really fills a nice niche of complexity that is actually hard to find. Regardless of all this, the game is beautiful and is worth having alone just for how precious it looks. Absolutely fine with 2-player but I would say 3 players would be a real sweet spot for this game.

Origin is one of those games when after you have finished playing you take a moment to survey the final board with a real sense of satisfaction. It really does look wonderful on the table, the artwork which is somewhat overshadowed by the pieces is also terrific. Although the central mechanism feels like it belongs in an abstract game Origin still seems very thematic. The way that the tribes interact and spread across the globe really adds to the atmosphere, with your agile slender tribes exploring far off lands whilst you strong chunky tribes muscle in on opposing players’ territories.

The basic mechanic of this game is interesting, the way you place, move, and swap/attack other players' pieces is well done. My issue is with the rest of the game, that devolves into a quick outward expansion to grab various VP in various was. As the majority of the interaction is with the board and the cards/innovation chits, it does not fuel much competition or interaction between players. Still I feel like the basic element and even the theme is quite appealing. I tend to dislike the special power effects/cards and I think if the game was designed for a more abstract or heavy gamer audience it could have been more appealing. As is, the game falls flat for me as the interesting abstract base mechanic gets mixed with some rather uninteresting ways to acquire VP similar to usual lighter euro games.

Origin is a great looking game but I wasn’t sure if it had enough game to keep me interested, as it turned out, Origin is much better than I was expecting, but it is still not a game for me.

I didn’t read the rules of the game and the person who explained it was a bit confused, it seems the game has two modes of play, beginners and advanced play or something like that. We played the advanced game which is rather light. After playing it face to face, I played it online to see if the rules were ok and they were in their majority. 

Playtime is under 60 minutes.

The art of the game is good, the cover of the box is great.

The game´s components are ok, but the pawns are amazingly good looking. The rest of the components are ok but the pawns command a lot of attention.

The theme is cool, but it is paper thin, you don´t feel it through the game.

Gameplay is kind of fun. The most important part is when you expand, you have to change only a characteristic of your tribe, it is innovative, thematic and fun. The pawns themselves have different advantages depending on their width and height. The other parts of the game are more mundane. You have to achieve goals having your pawns in some configuration on the board, you take cards that allow you to bend the rules, you collect technologies that net you points. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t obvious, but aren’t hard either. Origin has a light-medium weight.

There is a lot of luck with the cards (they seem unbalanced) and with the, strait and green tokens, I think it bothers me a bit as this kind of luck seems uncontrollable.

Bottom line, Origin is a good family level game, but it is way too light for my current tastes. I could play again if requested, but my desire to do so is rather low. I already sold my copy of the game, being a gorgeous game, it was very easy to sell. The luck factor is high and it can decide who wins the game. The pawn´s mechanism is very innovative but the rest of the game isn’t that fun.

This and [gameid=126042] where my best experiences of Spiel 2013. As it sold out at the fair, others seem to share this experience. It's a comparably easy rather abstract game that lives from its gorgeous components. Still, Origin manages to convey its theme of the evolution of mankind. 
The game starts with a small thin black pawn on a world map in approximately the location of today's Ethiopia. On his turn, a player chooses one of three actions. Mankind either evolves by settling an adjacent territory with a new tribe changed in one of the three attributes (increase in size, in thickness, or change in colour), migrates (moving pawn according to size) or engages in conflict (thicker pawns change place with smaller pawns). Depending on the target location, the player than takes cards and/or development tiles. Points can be derived from various sources such as completing scoring cards, bridging straits or settling victory point locations. There are minor possibilities for targetting other players which stay within manageable bounds for a family-oriented game.
While I'm not 100% sure about the balancing of the available actions, I really enjoyed this game and it's short enough and attractive enough to withstand minor balance issues.

Superbe matériel, tout pour me plaire à ce niveau. Par contre, le jeu me laisse froid. Trop chaotique, trop de mécaniques (cartes) pour un jeu que j'aurais voulu simple.

Let's get it out of the way: this game is GORGEOUS. Everything about it is a treat for the eyes, and after we finished I just wanted to look at the board for a few seconds and appreciate it. That doesn't happen often. Fortunately, the game play is also really good. Quite simple to learn, but kind of messes with your head when you're in it. And I know we've hardly scratched the surface of the strategies and tactics here. This is a great little game.

A light but fun tactical movement game. The theme makes it difficult to be completely PC during the game as your fat dudes beat on the thin dudes and the tall dudes run faster than the short dudes. And that is not even taking into account the colours...

A lot of fun though and I would play this again but would not buy it as our non-gaming friends might find the theme a little awkward/potentially racist. But I will happily play it with gamers.

Once you get past the fact that the brilliant artwork on the box is in no way indicative of what's in the game you'll find this to be a fun and concise euro game. The rules are tight and it offers a fun junior alternative for younger/newer gamers, and although the anime art of the box isn't present inside the aesthetics of the game are still great.

Great family game of the "upscaled" kind (rather abstract and demanding core game play combined with some luck of the draw by action cards, objectives, score markers with different point values). Even the Junior version (two different rulebooks are included) is not trivial at all. Beautiful components and the box insert for the pawns even has a function for gameplay. Well done again, Matagot!

Nice components to look at (even though the pawns could be better integrated into player discs), neat illustrations, an okay game with a little bit of challenge, little bit of randomness and VERY little player interaction. It really comes down to how lucky you are during drawing objectives, but for such a short game, randomness is not a problem.
Seek this if you want an area control more family-friendly than Small World or Metropolys.

Simpatico gioco di piazzamento lavoratori con meccaniche molto semplici, materiali di legno molto belli e dinamiche immediate ma per nulla banali. Il gioco offre una fortissima interazione e necessita di buona programmazione.

I like the gaming princilpe, it's easy to explain, but has more depth then you would think from reading the rules. My only worry with this game is, that it's not only important how good you play, but also how good the player at your right is. If he/she gives too many good locations as a 'gift', that can influence the outcome. But with equally skilled players, this can be a good game.

Origin is a very quick playing casual game that works very much like Takenoko, but perhaps one level higher in terms of difficulty. In a turn you do one thing, spawn new guy, move a guy or swap two guys next to each other. The components are very pretty, and there's a nice little set collection thing going on for extra points. Each one of those tiles has a nice looking illustration on it next to the strength rating of the tile, and the illustration turns out to have no in-game meaning. It makes me think it did something at some point in this game's development, but they stripped the rule out and kept the art assets. Who knows?

A nice typical euro point salad mid/light game. Teritory control plus scoring bonuses. Plays fast.

Minus point for pawn confusion - it's just hard to wrap your head around the evolution rule. Another minus point for a bit unfortunate color choosing - racist jokes or associations spring to mind way too quickly.

Big plus point, though, for the amazing production. Everything, starting from the colorful box, through board and elements, is superbly produced and the artwork is adorable. The game board has a big graphic on the back! On the back - which noone looks at through the whole game and it's usually just plain black or white. Hats off. 

After a while it might just get too simple and boring.

RATING: 6
Wonderful bits but I found it uninteresting. The cards rule and the board position means nothing really. Climate, etc. are ignored and you are just moving cool looking pieces around to get cards. This is based on one 2 player game so take the commentary for what its worth. There might be more competition for spaces  in a 4 player game (I might actually NEED to get stronger and faster to get the space I want). The most disappointing mechanic had to be the "innovation" spears. Abstract as hell and didn't feel like innovation at all.

RATING: 7
The components in this game are lovely, a series of pawns in various heights, thicknesses, and colours which are placed on the map with small wooden rings to indicate a player controls them. On your turn you place a piece in a territory (by evolving, moving, or displacing another piece) and then carry out the action for that space - which is usually to take a card and a technology token (but sometimes victory points). 
You can play cards, for an effect or a permanent bonus or victory points, and the idea is to accumulate the most victory points before the game ends.
The rules are easy to pick up (it was clear a few rounds in) and while the actions are all very similar they are distinct enough that your reasons for preferring one over the other are clear. There is both short term tactics and long term strategy in the game which for this type of game is unusual.

This is a straight up abstract game.  Each player sits around a map, on this map starts a single piece.  Each piece has 3 different characteristics that vary to 3 degrees; color, height, and width.  On a player's turn they can evolve a piece, placing one that shares 2 characteristics but varies the third in an adjacent space, this piece becomes their piece.  They can also move an already placed piece or attack which simply means switching their piece with an opponents.

At the end of each turn the space a player evolved, moved, or "attacked" to will be of a color corresponding to a deck of cards.  From this deck they will draw a card, the different types of cards are one-time abilities, permanent abilities, or objectives.  The objectives are the main way of earning points, in this way it feels very similar to Takenoko.

I'm not typically a fan of abstract games and that's really all this is.  I was engaged while playing, it's not broken and for the most part well designed but I guess I'm not always the most entertained when playing abstracts.  I say mostly well designed because I feel some of the permanent powers are a bit too powerful.  I ran away with this game the first time I played because of a couple of really strong powers I got and that kind of soured my victory a bit.

The pieces are certainly stellar in quality.  Nice chunky wooden pawns.  I just don't like them myself.  I think they are ugly, the colors are dull shades of brown, and at a glance some of the variations on height and width are hard to tell apart.

This is not a game that was high on my radar. I liked the art, but it looked quite abstract. And it is, but not as much as I expected it to be. I played mostly on gut feeling, but it became clear that this game has more subtleties hidden beneath it's surface. In fact, I think this game is a bit deeper than one might expect. I'm not sure there's too many different strategies to pursue, but still, I think there is replay value here. That being said, I wasn't blown away by this game. I think it's a fine game, not a great game.

I don't understand how people determine whether a game is abstract or thematic. Origin seems to be getting described as abstract, but it all makes perfect thematic sence to me. Want to evolve out from an existing village on the board? Fine, but you must share characteristics with the tribe you evolved from. Stronger tribes displace weaker ones and nomadic tribes wander freely across the planet. Sounds pretty thematic to me. And, oh my, is it pretty to look at.

It's a gentle, fast little game that I susepct won't find it's true market with gamers but is a charming little game to play. Have a think about what your move will allow others to do and the game is much better; if everyone simply evolves on their turn, not much happens. The game is also surprisingly interactive, especially with the action cards and I enjoyed it.

Takenoko meets Metropolys.  On first game the offspring doesn't appeal as much as either of its parents, but that could just be the learning process.  With movement rules and lots of special powers, there is a lot going on in this game.  Which rather belies its minimalist abstract overtones - with the outstanding "naive" tribe tokens.  Certainly merits further exploration.

Rating after one incomplete game at Essen. I liked the game OK, but the other players hated it, so we quit.

It is a very abstracted civ game. You place your villages on the board, then you get a reward for them, usually a card which can be e. g. bonus points or useful abilities.

Not knowing which color of cards is useful for what made the game a bit "opaque". 

It was also not so easy to wrap the head around the placement rules for the people tokens, although they are actually simple. 

There is some conflict - strong villages can remove weaker neighbours.

There's a lot that's neat about this game. I really like the artwork. I really like the wooden bits a lot. The tribe pawns are super cool and the placement rules make the game a fun challenge.

Every pawn has a size, a height and a strength (width). When you place a new pawn, the new pawn has to go adjacent to a pawn that matches two of the same characteristics of the one you are placing. Existing pawns can move up to the number of spaces equal to their height. And you can swap places with another pawn that is a number of spaces away equal to its height... provided it is stronger (wider).

The thing I don't love about the game is that the cards can make the game really swingy. The card that lets you place new pawns only having to match one characteristic, for example, seems a lot more powerful than many other cards. Some actions cards are entirely situational and might not be anything useful to you. I ended up starting with objective cards that required me to have a bunch of pawns on the other side of the world, something that would have taken a lot of effort to do. Alternatively, another player kept drawing objective cards he already could fulfill.

It seems a little bit a shame, as I think there is an interesting game here, if not for the randomness of the card decks.

Devoid of fun.  The scoring was fairly tight, but there just wasn't a palpable sense of a tense game.

Beautifully produced game. Theme well represented, although with some abstract mechanisms. always produces a close game. Criticisms along the lines of "the game is broken" seem to me to be written by people who haven't read the rules properly.

Provisional rating, one 3p play (at Spiel). Liked it. There seemed little interaction between the players, but that might change with in a 4-person game.

A good first game but we played it to friendly. We should have traded more. Material is nice but the villages shouldn't have holes. The little pawns now dissapear into them, as a result they are not on the same height anymore.

An ok game. I like the pieces and the strategy of changing the size of guys. Games come really close in score though.

Good, possibly very good, simple, "thematic abstract"(TM) game with some randomness but interesting, surprisingly complex decisions despite the only 3 very simple possible actions. Very easy/friendly/welcoming with almost everything scoring you points, but with repeated plays and experience you can probably become good at the game with actions contributing to multiple scoring opportunities and intentional blocking of other players.

With repeated plays I seem to have become better at it although I still have no real idea how to play well. There seems to be quite a bit of hidden depth to this.

A pleasant surprise: a quite abstract game with few and precious rules, but which is engaging and packs quite a lot of fun in a short playing time.

Fine game, very pleasant and with excellent components. I would be happy to play this again but feel no incentive to seek out another play.

This game has some great depth, and strategy!  I like how it is abstract, but the theme is there.  the component quality on this game is phenomenal and I love the big chunky wooden pieces.  the strategy of knowing when to put your people where makes it a great game, and well loved.

Solid 7+ Euro civ/expansion game with extra points for incredible wood components.

Just for a moment try not to be distracted by the wonderful components and big big big meaples: this is a very nice game with an original mechanism of expansion/evolution ( i adore the fact that, after a while, a line of evolution reaches its maximum span and stops). Clever, simple enough, fast enough. The only possible complaint could be that cards are really really strong and varied but you don't draw many of them so luck is quite important and manages to swerve the game in really unpredictable ways.

[+2 VP to me for using "swerve" as an english word for the first time in my life without peeking in the dictionary!]

RATING: 7.2
Very nice components and decent enough game. Would say it's more of a family game. I don't think there is much strategy going on but only played it a couple of times and only with 2. Will update after more plays.
EDIT:
Feels much better with 3 and 4 players and I have upped my rating from 6.2 to a 7.2.

It is difficult for me to express my admiration for the production quality of this game without using words like 'cellulose', 'lumberjack', and 'wood death of the universe'.  Even [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nco_kh8xJDs]Alice in Chains[/url] would be proud.

An abstract game with gorgeous components, quick gameplay. Feels kind of random, because you have very little information on the goals other players are trying to achieve.

This is actually quite brilliant!  Why anyone would ever play without the card effects is beyond me, because they make the game.  They give you goals, powers to use or keep out of play, and options.  This is a wonderful game with inspirational components.

I played it once, 2 player, junior mode.
It's a "7" game, fast (40' with rules explanation) and easy, set collection game. If your partner dont like interaction, you can go north and west on map, and leave south and east to him, for example. The size and shape of the paws may cause some confusion at start, but dont worry :)

Great game. Easy to teach, kid friendly pieces, surprising amount of depth that emerges as you decide bewteen migrating or evolving off of another tribe.

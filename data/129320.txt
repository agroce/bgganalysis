I like the game, but there's something wrong with it.  I think the cards need to be ordered better: more stacks or ordered or something.  I had several turns--of the 7 total in the game--where I had nothing to do.  Not because I didn't have an engine going, so much as just bad card draws.  I worry that it may have almost the same problem as [b]Quarriors[/b], where the double-randomness makes each turn really chaotic and too hard to plan.  Good quality, but criminally large box for the game!

There's not much to this game, but it's still fun.  Aside from the dice drafting, nearly everything about this game is luck based.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though.  As long as you don't take this game too seriously, you'll have a good time.

A fun, silly Euro with lots of dice to roll. No doubt the die hard Eurogamers want to vomit when they see all the cubes of disparate randomness but that is what makes this game fun. But that box! What the ....! I understand you want to list your Kickstarter backers but do that in the rulebook. Don't make a box that is 50% unusable space.

Castle Dice is a fun experience; it's essentially a euro style game with a heavy dice based "feast or famine" element. 

Component quality was noticeably sub-par, including misshapen dice, and extremely shoddy cards. The need to purchase the expansion in order to fix certain design and component issues was also particularly frustrating, as it nearly doubled the price-tag.

For me, despite some fairly entertaining moments, this game wears a bit thin on repeat plays.

A dice game that doesn't have lot's of rules, has a lot of custom dice and cute artwork and doesn't overstay its welcome (pretty close to the 45min frame at least with 2 players that just learned the game). I have yet to try with the full arsenal of 4 players, which is bound to create some chaos but quite a bigger dice pool for the dice drafting), but come on..any game that features donkeys is fine in my book.

It's a bit high-variance for me -- oddly more because of the cards than the dice. But I think the real problem is Kickstarteritis. There's a good game in here, but the balance, the components, and the rules just needed more development. I'd play it again, but there are better options in the same gamespace.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Wow... This one was a surprise.  Didn't know quite what to expect going in, but I ended up really liking the game. I have only played with the expansion which adds unique castle decks per player, and I thought that part was pretty cool.  I really like rolling the dice, and combining them all into one large pool.  Lots of interesting choices in a pretty short play time.  The box is huge, so they better pump out a ton of expansions for this.  One I would like to pick up a copy of at some point...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game plays relatively quickly and can be a lot of fun. My wife and sister-in-law really enjoy the game, it would get played a lot more if my nephew wasn't dead set against it.

The expansion is a must for adding replayability. The different roles are different enough that they really change the feel of the game depending on which you have.

RATING: 4
I would play this once in a while. But with the chaotic distubution of the cards to build, I find it hard to plan and one can have difficulties getting the engine running to make the game function well.

It's alright, but not something that I would own.

A delightful dice game that actually feels somewhat strategic and isn't too frustrating when the dice don't roll your way. Most "bad rolls" can be mitigated by card/worker effects, and being able to draw from a communal dice pool not only gives you more options than other dice games, but also makes the game much more interactive.

If I had one complaint, it would be in the random draw of the cards, which seem way more random than the dice! Having more of an open market system for the cards (a la Ticket to Ride), or maybe adding a drafting phase at the beginning of the game would make this much more strategic and fun, IMO.

Played through three games. We like it. It has a tense feeling to it, kinda like the last 3-4 rolls of Castles of Burgundy. You never have everything you need so you have to make due and hope for the best. The art is awesome and it is simple. 

update may 2014: we love this game. We love the tough choices and the low scoring. It makes for close games and hard choices. We are excited for the expansion. Should be a great addition.

This game looks fantastic but just doesn't live up to the luck. You don't feel like you have much control of any sort of strategy or plan. You just try and build what you drew in the card phase. I think drawing from a small face up choice around the table would have been better. 1 Play.

The dice rolling is fun, and is the core mechanic behind the game, but it is the "drafting" of the dice each round that sets this game apart from many other dice games.

I still have only played with 2 players, so I would love to see how it plays with more (meaning more dice available at draft time)

RATING: 7.5
Surprisingly complex game, give the "Dice" in it's name.  While there is an obvious amount of luck involved, the dice rolls determine the resources available to everyone, so any good/bad luck the dice bring affects everyone pretty much equally.  Beyond that, the game is a typical resource management game.  While never my top pick for a gaming session, no one complains when I suggest it either.

Castle Dice is a great game. It's easy to learn and fun to play for even those who are not much into Boardgames. The mechanics are fun and feel fresh to me. The dice pool adds a bit of luck to it as does drawing cards, but it adds to the strategy to work around what you get in order to take the win. I've enjoyed it from my first play until now and I am looking forward to the expansion.

Holy random, Batman! looks like a nice resource management game but it quickly shows it spots: no need to try and keep resources from turn to turn as there are plenty of resources and the players only really need to concentrate on the current turn. Very low scores for the amount of work done by the players and the luck of the draw means that you can easily get some very powerful cards through no real strategy.
Inoffensive game but not for me.

Anche questo gruppo ha molto apprezzato il gioco e il suo regolamento rapido e divertente. 
Essendo io alla seconda partita devo dire che lo sto apprezzando sempre di più... Belle le componenti, belle le strategie, divertente il gioco... Wink
------------------------------------------------------

Il tuo obiettivo è riuscire a costruire il castello migliore (leggi, avere più punti vittoria a fine partita). 
Ogni turno vengono lanciati dei dadi che mettono a disposizione delle risorse, le quali servono per assoldare abitanti del villaggio (ognuno con la sua abilità, ottenibili pescando carte da un mazzo) e costruire parti del castello (parti che si ottengono pescando carte da un mazzo diverso da quello degli abitanti). 
La cosa divertente del gioco è che i dadi vengono sì lanciati, ma vengono poi messi a disposizione di tutti. Quindi quelli che lanci non sono per forza quelli che ottieni. inoltre ci sono due variabili molto divertenti: 
- attenzione ai barbari! Ogni dado ha una faccia rappresentante un barbaro. Quando la ottieni, durante il lancio, essi non vengono messi a disposizione degli altri giocatori ma te li devi mettere tu sulla plancia e subire una razzia a fine turno, proporzionale a quanti barbari hai ottenuto 
- ogni turno ti vengono messi a disposizione una quantità e una tipologia ben precisa di dadi, più alcuni dadi che puoi scegliere in base alla strategia che vuoi cercare di attuare.

This is a fun game. It's a good gateway game that has enough for experienced players to enjoy as well. Very easy to teach. The components are great and they also have good customer service. I would add the expansion for simplifying the experience. THe added components/ markers help to keep track of what is going on when you first start playing. They're no necessary, but the help.

Interesting light Euro. Wish the game made me feel like I was building things. Everything in the game felt too expensive and as a result, an end game score of 12 felt very unsatisfying. Luck of the draw definitely a factor. Dice rolling surprisingly wasn't as strategy-changing as I thought.

Pretty high on this game right now.  So many Euros have too many moving pieces and not enough text on the playing area as reminders for what everything does.  Castle Dice is a relief, a breath of fresh air.  It uses plenty of actual descriptive words and a very streamlined order to play reminder.  If more Euros were easier to follow along, they wouldn't all have this "if you've played one, you've played them all" feel to them.

I've relieved to find a good Euro that feels unique and fun.

Decent game but would be better if victory points weren't so heavily dependent on random draws from a deck and the possibility of rolling too many barbarians which will reduce saved resources needed to build  things to earn victory points.

This is a surprisingly fun and simple tabalau building die rolling game. Each turn you get a specific set of dice which you then add a set amount of your choice too and then all are rolled and the results drafted by all the players. 

There are two card types people or buildings and each have different abilities are require different resources to build. 

It never does really feel like you are building a castle but it is still fun nonetheless.

I like how despite this being a dice game, the drafting mechanic detaches how well you do from your luck with the dice. A bad roll can happen, but it's easy to mitigate if you think ahead a little bit. The strategy is engaging and fun, though I think a few dominant strategies will emerge after a few plays.

I like this a lot and never play without the expansion. Yes, it feels like a lot of solitaire and number-crunching to calculate whether I can get a card built or not with the dice available. No, there's not tons of interaction, or points, or skillful play involved. But it's still fun. Maybe it's just all of those dice, or the artwork, or the fact that others enjoy it too. I always have a good time playing this game (and I usually win). Hmm, maybe THAT's why I like it?

It's cute. The dice choice mechanic is a little like Factory Manager; you choose what the draft pool will contain, but no guarantee you'll get what you put out. The barbarians mean that it's usually best to spend as much as you can of the resources you have.  The good cards can be a little hard to find. Overall, it's a light game but does include fun with card combos and drafting; I liked it more than I expected.  The box is TOTALLY RIDICULOUS. (1 play)

Awful game. First of all the dice are too small, it's sometimes hard to tell them apart (especially cows and pigs).

Second, the dice drafting aspect is just so boring and tedious. There are way too many dice to draft. Seasons did it right with only 1 die per person.

Third, the game pace is out of whack. It's so hard to build anything and the game only last 7 rounds so you don't feel like you did much. Compare to Agricola where you can get your engine going and actually use it.

Castle Dice is a light worker-placement, dice-drafting game in which the players have been ordered by the king to build castles along the borders of the kingdom. The player who can create the greatest castle will become the new heir to the throne. Players will explore the land by rolling the dice, and then take turns gathering resources from them. These resources are then used to hire workers and improve castles. Players must gather and spend wisely as the Barbarians from the neighboring lands will attack players and steal their resources throughout the game. At the end of seven turns, the player who has built the greatest castle (earned the most victory points) wins the game!

I think I may prefer this if the decks were setup differently (and it can be done so, as a house rule or variant).  I like the mechanisms and options.  I wished that the decks split up more based upon characters versus buildings and you can choose what ratio to have in your hand at start of each round.  Game as is, the characters and buildings are all mixed up with each other in both draw piles.

If one draws way too many characters or way too many buildings (later more likely) than I think that can be a much tougher game to manage.

This is an interesting take on dice drafting that can be a bit overshadowed/let down by too much randomness in the three card decks.  Don't know if some form of card drafting would help in evening out luck of the draw.  Players need to realize that this is a dice game and not highly strategic - taking a long time to think about their limited choices is aggravating.  The game box is an odd size, but I heard they developed it this way on purpose to be able to add expansions in the future.

I really like the shared dice pool mechanic this game implements. After everyone chooses and rolls their different resource dice, all the dice are pooled together, and then players take turn drafting one die at a time. It really mitigates the huge luck aspect that comes with most dice-rolling games, and adds a huge amount of strategy. 

The only real complaint I have about this game is that it feels like there aren't enough rounds to do anything truly meaningful or grand. It feels like the game comes to a sudden halt just as your strategy is starting to develop.

RATING: 8
Gloriously simple once you get going, and who doesn't love rolling handfuls of custom dice?  The turn order is right on your personal mat, and nothing is all that complicated.  The rule book annoyingly lists a key game mechanic in a tip box instead of where you'd actually look for it, and one card is confusing, but once that's straightened out, it's pretty fun.  It's not aggressively competitive, but competing for resources can be challenge enough!  Attractive, durable components.

Includes solo rules which are actually kind of fun.

The main bad thing is that, being dice- and draw-based, bad luck can screw you, and it's long enough that losing horribly to that doesn't feel too good.  But there are usually things you can do to mitigate it.

The box is ridiculous, had to cut down for my own sanity.

This game looks simple but none of the instructions can be omitted before play and the 7 turns make it seem deceptively short.  I've averaged about 3.5 hours a sit down with all new players, including teaching.

I'm pretty sure I like Castle Dice, I might really like it but I haven't been able to get it to the table enough to really be able to evaluate it.

This was the first "dice drafting" game I ever played, and it feels like it came out an AGE before any other such games (which as of 2015 is a bonafide phenomenon).

I love the theme, and the game is MUCH better with the expansion as it helps mitigate luck.

The only thing holding this game back is the play length.  It's crunchier than you might imagine and it can get kind of fiddly towards the end.  I play with very slow players often, which doesn't help.  Overall the depth to length ratio feels a tad off.  Agreeing beforehand to reduce the rounds is a solution.

As I play this more with people who know it better, I could see this rising to a solid 8.

Pretty fun little dice drafter. Games are short and play moves fast but definitely not a filler. Tons of dice rolling yet meaningful decisions.

Not a bad game but not a lot to distinguish it in the field aside from the buckets of custom dice. I enjoyed it all right but there wasn't much call for it so it just wasn't hitting the table. In the sea of amateur Kickstarter games, this is one of the best, but still doesn't make the cut.

Traded for Empires of the Void in math trade May 2014.

RATING: 6
While rolling the big handfuls of beautiful custom dice is fun the overall game play is not as satisfying. The dice part of the game works pretty well where you can increase the odds of gathering the resources you want by the additional dice you choose to roll. The way each player suffers alone from the barbarians they roll but that then all of the remaining dice are put into the world pool for resource gathering provides a nice balance between the luck of the dice and mitigation for the people that claim dice hate them.

The problem I have is that the randomness of the card draw provides much to big a swing. If you get a handful of cards you can't possibly afford early on while you opponents are able to build workers and guards you are screwed. Your opponents will get more resources than you and be able to save them so that they can afford to actually build some expensive cards. Similarly in a close game if you draw crap in the last round and you can't build anything then you lose.

I think that it can be too frustrating due to random elements beyond your control.

This was okay and had some novel elements and interesting dice which you draft. However, the luck of the marauders is too high and I always felt the game finished too early. I don't mean I always wanted to do more on my turn (which is a good game trait) but that you never get a good engine going until the last turn (maybe). But due to the round design, there's no way to extend the rounds.

Near miss for me.

This game really impressed me at first. It really scratches that dice-rolling itch, because there's nothing quite like rolling a ton of custom dice. Unfortunately, there aren't really any ways to catch up once you start to fall behind, and there have been those games where a ton of barbarians came up to throw things off. This is also similar to other Kickstarter Euro games where the turn structure is so rigid and procedural, it doesn't leave any room for creative play. It's a decent game, but it definitely reeks of the Kickstarter taint.

"Dice drafting, resource management, and building for VPs. Solid, aside from a couple fiddly rules."

What I liked:
- Creative mechanisms
- Only a couple attack cards, which could be removed
- Very good components (except that cows look like barbarians)
- You can carry over cards and resources to the next round
- Fixed number of rounds

What I didn't like:
- You might not get good cards, even if you go fishing
- Many of the market cards seem worthless
- The majority-based special ability rules are a nuisance
- The cows look too much like the barbarians

I would put the weight just a bit higher than the BGG-voted 2.4, and I think it's a Strategy game, not a Family game. Our 3p game with 2 first-timers took almost 2 hours. It would be much better at 45-60 minutes.

I'm not sure why I didn't like the game more. My horrible card draws (despite making sacrifices to draw even more cards) didn't help. I wouldn't mind playing again to see if I liked it more. But I also wouldn't mind never playing again. My very-casual gamer wife enjoyed it, and "wouldn't mind playing again".

Based on one play: A game that is not really a genre that I like, but I gave it a try. Needless to say, lots of dice rolling, which was actually the best part, you roll resources and then place them in a pool for drafting. It was the cards which give you points and workers that was more frustrating. Random dice with random cards is too much for me. We mostly came away with negative feelings for the game.

Castle Dice is a dice rolling game in which players choose what kind of dice they want to roll, add the results to a common pool, and then draft the dice to gain the printed resources.  You're using these resources to build cards from your hand, which give you points and bonuses.  It's a neat concept, but there are a few aspects of the game that keep me from liking it more.  First off, "barbarian" results on the dice stay with the player instead of going into the pool, and players that happen to roll barbarians are at a pretty big disadvantage in terms of turn-to-turn planning as they eat unused resources.  Secondly, animal resources seem underpowered, as to be of use you need to be the clear leader in the category (which doesn't often happen), and the cards you get for turning in a set of them seem to be more of a booby prize than an actual asset (in fact, the game forces you to turn in sets).  So, I was impressed by the clever mechanisms, but I wish the balance issues were ironed out better.

Oh the things that this game does so wrong.  You have to build things for victory points.  With a low variety of things to build, you are battling for the same resources.  Okay, and you get resources from drafting the results of dice rolls.  So your resources may not be rolled there to be drafted at all, if they are there everyone before you grabbed it because you are all building the same thing.  And then if you roll any barbarians, they take your resources off of you, because getting them in the first place was not hard enough.  And you might change your position in the resource draft, if you collect enough of the right symbol to have a majority of those symbols. If anybody rolls them.  If no one grabs them before it gets to your turn.  This is a 7 round game, and I wasted 5 rounds wishing I could do anything satisfying. Awful Awful game.  I usually blame myself for not being able to play a game well when I lose.  This one, it wasn't all on my shoulders.  So many things were just design choices that took the worst aspects of using that given design element, and few if any of the good aspects. Avoid it.

Dice + Drafting, what could go wrong? Castle Dice is a pretty fantastic idea, and I'm one of the people who really enjoys the toony art style, but I feel like the draft phases goes on a bit too long and the cards are certainly imbalanced. Most of the time, I didn't see a point to collecting the animals except to get a shot at the market deck. Also, I don't think there are enough ways to score points.

Overall: Great idea with mediocre execution. I'd play it again, but feel no desire to recommend it.

Spring 2013: Demoed it back in Nov. 2012.  Don't know if I'd spend $50-60 on it, but it's a cool little game for sure.  

Update Nov. 2013: Just picked it up at 50% off from One-Eyed.  Really looking forward to playing.....

Update Sept. 2014: 8 plays in 18 months. Game is always well-received. Really think it's an under-rated game (ranked around 1500 now). The "dice pool" idea is very cool. There's certaisnly some luck in card draws, but that's fine with me. Scores are always very tight with 10 points usually good enough to win in our plays.

well balanced and nice components.  Lacks in strategic control.  You are essentially randomly handed a strategy and then tactically try to make it work.  As such, it can be a little unsatisfying, although it does play smoothly and the strategies that you might be handed are pretty well balanced.

note: none of the crazy spite cards came out in my frist game.  They would probably have ruined it for me.

The extreme randomness of dice combined with the randomness of not one, but two decks of cards results in a game play experience that isn't ideal.  Drafting from a common dice pool is interesting, but getting devastated by Barbarians turn after turn and not getting the right cards to defend to do anything useful is highly annoying and problematic.  As a result, some games involve 3-4 of the 7 rounds being completely unproductive for a player.  Not fun.  It really comes down to being able to get the right cards and then the dice to accomplish those cards, but since it's so incredibly random, the game just becomes frustrating.  Typically things only line up for one player and that player ends up winning the game by a significant margin.  To make matters worse, the game feels like it goes on about 1-2 turns too long.  I like this game less and less with each successive play.

Loads of dice, great idea, and gameplay works... to a point. But over 2 hours for 4P game and chances of being totally out of a game and still having to endure another hour of dice chucking.

The game play is light and fun. You can’t plan too far ahead because of not knowing how the dice will roll. Gather too many resources and the barbarians might take it away. What cards you get are important, but since that’s random it’s another element you can’t control, but have to adapt to. There are a lot of options to pursue. It definitely feels like you’re building a castle, but the villagers kind of throw it off. It feels like you are building a village with a castle. It’s not bad, just not what we were expecting. Overall, I do like the gameplay. It’s not like anything I’ve played before. My husband really likes it. He thinks it’s very well balanced, which he thinks is hard for a dice game that gives meaningful choices. So, we are overall happy we supported the kickstarter. It’s a good addition to our game collection.

RATING: 5
I certainly like rolling dice and I like the idea of those dice representing resources.  This game looked and even played a little like Quarriors, which fell flat for me but had huge potential I felt.  This game however failed to grab me at all.

The game is played pretty simply.  Every player rolls a set of dice that are added to a giant pool.  The players then take turns picking dice from this pool which generate resources.  Then those resources are used to play cards that represent buildings and helpers.  These also translate to victory points and the player with the most at the end of the game wins.

Not very deep but that's okay, there is some variety in the cards you play each turn and that gives you enough decisions to make that this game isn't on autopilot but also not enough that your decisions feel very impactful or interesting.

My biggest complaint with this game was the lack of balance in the cards you can play.  Some of the buildings, for example, had powerful abilities while others did not yet the ones that did not cost more resources.  There was one deck of cards that you had to sacrifice a lot to draw from and some of the cards in there were very powerful while others were big duds.  This made luck-of-the-draw a huge issue and made things very frustrating when you watch other players playing great cards you never see or when you sacrifice a lot to draw a dud from the "powerful" deck.

On top of that I'm not a huge fan of games with very little points to pass around and this one definitely doesn't have a lot.  The most points you are going to get out of any single card is 4 (which would require saving for several turns to play) and the end-game tallies only offer up 2 more points.

Finally, and this isn't an issue for anyone who doesn't have the game but for me is just a little irritating, the box is obnoxiously big.  It's extremely tall and when you open it you see that at least half of it is unused space.

I simply think there are much better filler dice-rolling games available that this one is a huge pass.  Get Dungeon Roll instead.

Castle Dice is a game that I really expected to like more than I did. I am a huge fan of drafting, and I really like dice, but somehow Castle Dice felt just "nice". The reason for this is probably the luck involved in drawing the cards. I mean, drawing new cards has a cost, and their usefulness is completely dependent on the strategy you are pursuing. This makes it necessary to keep drawing cards, hoping to obtain the ones you really need, but other players may well get those cards the first time they draw. Because of this, Castle Dice is a fun enough game, but not one that I will actively seek out.

A nice dice-rolling resource game with cute cartoony art and piles of great chunky plastic dice.

Fun, light game.  I get a little annoyed with games that have too many phases, feel like this game could be a bit more streamlined rather than having to call out, "Okay now it's the workers produce phase, now it's the activate Merchant's phase, etc."  Everyone is involved in every action though, which is great.

The game is all familiar mechanisms, aside from the concept of choosing dice and forming a random pool of resources per turn that is drafted.

I'm excited for the expansions because I feel the game has a nice, simple groundwork but could certainly benefit from a little extra meat and decisions.  There's not enough variety in castle buildings, feel's like everyone is working towards the same things.

Also I get annoyed by being restricted by cards for actions.  Some turns you just get so many duplicates of things you don't want.

Overall though, I like the game, works nice as a gateway game for non-gamers, and a fun beer and pretzels experience for seasoned gamers.

Fun drafting game, thinking about picking it up after playing.  A lot of luck that needs to be worked around, but working around it better than other players is the strategy of the game.

Had a blast playing this with 1 friend.  I have a bias toward dice games, and the drafting mechanic gives a nice overlay.  I wish the card selection was a bit less random (may experiment with some house rules) but overall I see myself enjoying this many times and introducing it to many people.

The shared dice pool drafting system is quite cool, and it makes sure you can always do something useful on your turn. Felt a bit too long for what it is, and it kind of falls into a category of games that do nothing wrong, but doesn't do anything to stand out from the crowd either.

After our first play, I was pleasantly surprised. This game is more than just rolling some dice. The artwork may look a bit childish, but the gameplay certainly isn't. This is the first game I know, where you win with a smashing 8 points! Promising!

Really fun dice-pool selection game about building a castle. Easy to learn. Can be a bit frustrating if you roll too many barbarians.  Am considering house-ruling out the barbarians entirely.

another type of dice play worker placement game.  It has an interesting style, and is pretty fun.  The whole dice pool mechanic removes some of the strategy I feel, since you don't get to keep "your" dice.  Since the points are quite limited, it is important to keep even on all fronts, especially the market cards, where there are the Bards, and don't let anyone get both "animals" and "villagers" points.

cool dice drafting from a central pool mechanic...you can get hosed with unlucky card draws and with 4 players the cards spread too much between players to get the card you need easily...the point totals are quite low and the point spread is pretty small...don't like the glass beads for resource tracking, too big...still a nice game though

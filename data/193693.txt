Agamemnon is an abstract game with a pasted on theme of conflict between Greeks and Trojans.  That said, the pasting is artfully done.  I like the notion that Strings of Fate connect the spaces on the board and hence that some of the pieces are weavers of those strings. I like that the leaders are all characters from The Iliad.

The game involves placing two pieces per turn in vacant spaces on the board.  The goal is to control those strings.  There are three types of string and each is controlled in a different way.  So far so ho hum.  Two things add interest; the random order in which pieces are drawn and the type of weaver that can switch string pieces.  Those random draws mean this is a highly tactical game of making the best use of each piece as it turns up.

There is something admirable about a rulebook that tells you "...this is your game.  Play it how you see fit."  To that end, Agamemnon provides a double-sided board and a choice of three ways to select pieces for placement.   Those choices are about the degree of control you want to have over the selection of pieces. 

Production quality and artwork are more than acceptable for a game that is really quite cheap.  The box and the board are both rather lovely.  I could have wished for chunkier string and playing pieces, but it's not like I have paid for them.  The rules are fine.

Excellent two player game where you are trying to build and take lines all over the board.  But you have to be careful though because you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking you are winning.  In the ends scores were close and came down to a single placement that won my opponent the game.

Very enjoyable abstract. I like the quick play time and the uncertainty introduced by the random token draw. Gives you a lot to think about and the outcome seems to always be in doubt till the end.

RATING: 7
Very cool two player sort-of abstract in a similar vein to Neuroshima hex without battles. This one instead is about area control, but you're still drawing units out of a bag.

The area control in this game is wild because you're vying for majorities in threads of fate. This means you're fighting over lines of connected spaces.

The other wrinkle is that there are three types of threads and each is controlled in different ways, some by sheer number of units, others by total strength (combat prowess), and final by highest ranked leader.

While the setting of the battle of Troy isn't extremely strong, the theme of manipulating forces as a god to control the strands of fate does come through a bit. It's a very cool concept and pulled off pretty well. The strategy inherent in the game is interesting too. Add in the fact that it plays quickly and you have a winner.

I dunno... I'm a big fan of abstracts but this one seemed a little too simplistic for my tastes.  I think my biggest problem with Agamemnon is that one can easily figure out the best move for the two tokens they have drawn, as long as your opponent doesn't mind you AP'ing your turn.  So either you AP for the best move (which will reveal itself if you stare hard at the board) or you try to make the game move so you just place your tokens in their most immediately obvious best place.  This would be a rather plodding game if not for the four tokens that allow to flip the position of certain components or cut the routes between components.  It's fairly unpredictable when your opponent is going to do this and where, so one can't really plan for it.  I like abstracts where every player has the same pieces, but they draw them at different times (see 'Attika', 'The Duke') but Agamemnon felt way too dependent on luck-of-the-draw and AP'ing for best moves.  Quite unexciting.

This is good 2 players game, the balance of luck and strategy is very well.
And 2 variant are good for me, in my situation we are fond of mix of "Loom" and a part of "Oracle".
(we mix worrior and leader but weaver is separated)

Actually, it's great game!

I played this once and said, "If you think about it, it's basically an area control game that works for 2 players, so that's cool." Then someone pointed out its designer also made Kahuna, which is another game I'd describe that way. Maybe it's his thing? Anyway, this seemed to need the special "warp" and "woof" tiles to make it work, but that made the timing of drawing those tiles very swingy. I liked the rounds when I wasn't drawing them just fine.

Consider AUCTION -

RATING: 8
This is a game for board game geeks who are kind of disappointed that other board gamers don't like chess.  You have to consider what both you and your opponent have left to draw and think several moves ahead.

In spite of that, however, it moves surprisingly quickly and is not-chess enough that my brother (who doesn't like chess) still enjoyed it and even won 1 of our 2 games.

The variants included in the rulebook seem well considered and allow you to customize the influence of RNG as you see fit, and the "Loom" variant in particular is designed to prevent a player from just "learning the board" and developing a strategy that works every time, even if you simultaneously use the RNG-free variant.

Came with plenty of extra pieces, cardboard is not inspiring, but not flimsy either.
The theme is skin-deep and only there to make it easier to describe the pieces ("strings" instead of "sequences of patterned connector tiles," "warrior strength" instead of "the number of connected pips," etc).

Place tokens to control 'strings' of tiles, most tiles wins. At the start of the game your choices are nice and open so it's easy to make a good move. A couple of turns in your choices become obvious, then a couple of turns later they are so limited that they're hardly choices at all. The overall feel is a less clever less interesting take on Knizia's Samurai. It is short at least.

Components are pretty mediocre too, thin counters, fiddly little tiles, dull board.

Abstract game and become better with playing. This is surely themeless and it seems to me a light go-like game but not a must-buy option.

Someone saw someone coming here - what were Osprey thinking? A dull board, and a game design concept that could be threads, roads, space wormholes, colours, indeed - anything. It's too simple - too random - only one interesting piece - the Warp. It could be made better but is it worth it? Nice box though.

This is a very good 2-player abstract with interesting choices to make presented in an attractive book fold box. It's "thinky" without overwhelming AP types so it plays in a satisfyingly short time. The advanced game on the reverse side of the board varies set up to ensure each game plays much differently than the next. I'll be introducing and playing this with a lot of my friends.

Pretty bland game. It's good as a quick 2-player diversion, but there are other games much better for that like Mr. Jack.  I don't really like when the game is as abstract as this. The theme is as thin as cardboard and I feel like I'm playing a game of checkers rather than an awesome boardgame. My main issue I suppose is the simplicity of the game, though that is its own strength. I like having more meat on my game.

Neat little two-player abstract. After four or five plays it becomes a little samey - but the meta from playing the same opponent over and over is awesome. Also it takes literally 20 minutes to play, so there's that.

After Pente, this is my favorite two player abstract game.  Beautifully executed with variant rules to keep things fresh -- and perhaps even deliver a better game experience.  The paper-thin theme is about as well executed as one could expect for a game of this type (and the attention to production details are spectacular).  The rule book is clear and easy to read.  My only concern is the small size of the tokens, and this is the only think keeping this from getting an even higher rating.

RATING: 8
First play impressions: Now this is how you make a two player abstract! It really has everything: fast play time, simple ruleset, and a couple of variants to try out if the game ever starts to get stale or if you want to decrease the luck factor.

The game itself is pure elegance. From the ancient look of it to the gameplay. You and your opponent each have the same set of tiles and on a turn you randomly draw two of them to play. So the game is basically perfect-information because you know what your opponent has and where they can play, but you just don't know when the right tiles will be drawn.

I really don't have any complaints. Rating could potentially go up after more plays.

Two player abstract strategy for area control of routes on a game board of interconnected points.  The meat of the game after placing a path segment is drawing and revealing a random warrior tile with variable strength or special ability and deciding where to place it for control or manipulation of the developing routes.

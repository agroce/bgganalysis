RATING: N/A
Not for very young kids, due to it requiring more dexterity than original Rhino Hero, this was even more fun for adults.

Stacking towers on towers and creating diagonal walkways was really enjoyable and surprisingly difficult!

Wouldn't need to own at this point, as my kids are too young for it, but would gladly play again.

better than the original in just about every way (except that it needs a much larger footprint, making it tough to table at a bar e.g.). The rules for fighting could be improved with house ruling, but it's a HABA game so I can't really fault it. Good fun.

Phew! I wondered if it would deliver as a sequel. After a couple of plays, it feels like there is room for both. Our second building was a bit nuts and had a great 3D effect. Fun game. If stacking things as high as you can before it falls over amuses you, there's a good chance you'll like this.

A strict improvement over its predecessor. It trades out the Uno-like card play for a more direct stacking of a wild multi-floored building. Involves more dice rolls as the result tells you how far you can move up the structure, and then you resolve battles with enemies on the same level.

This game is more exciting and much more of a spectacle than Rhino Hero. Heavily recommended.

House of cards stacking game.   It seems like the die for movement is very suspect.  It appears to be skewed in order to produce as much conflict as possible on the first few floors.   I guess if you are very lucky, your hero can climb way up and you will win, regardless.   Despite that die, there is a lot of fun in this box.   Might not be a great choice for kids who are easily frustrated, however.

Its different from the original, the tower looks far more impressive as it builds and it is a lot more stable and I do like the long walls and short walls, however the dice rolling for climbing floors and then battling is rather boring and feels very tacked on... but I suppose it does usually result in an actual winner rather than the usual loser who collapsed the tower everyone else wins.

Super Battle takes the basic ideas that made its predecessor so attractive and adds a number of design features and tactical considerations. It certainly looks cool as the tower is being built- the vivid colors and varied patterns are almost lysergic. The pawns are terrific and, overall, the production is excellent. After several plays with adults and kids alike, I have decided that I like Super Battle even more than Rhino Hero. Both are silly fun, but the sequel’s added elements make it the more engaging choice.

Overall, Rhino Hero: Super Battle is a huge hit. I've been bringing it to game lunches, board game nights, and parties, and it's been huge everywhere. People really, really like it. And I do too! It's not quite as high on my list as Ice Cool, but it's still a very solid entry in the stacking game genre and probably one that everyone should own. While I mildly purrfer the theme of Cat Tower, I gotta give this one to Rhino Hero: Super Battle; it's really an excellent game!

This is easily the most interesting game you can ever play in public.  What looks at first like a cheap children's toy turns quickly into a multi-leveled colorful spectator-magnet. For a game that features disaster as it's penultimate moment, setups and teardowns after a game are shockingly quick and easy.  With no experience whatsoever, we slid in three full plays in a little under an hour. Think more exciting Jenga with half the setup time.  Easily the best dexterity game I've ever played.

Rating and comments based on a 2-player experience only. 

I played this game for a while with my nearly 6-year-old son thinking that the ultimate goal was to reach the top of the tower and grab the 'Winning Medal'. Instinctive logic, right? But played in this fashion, it didn't grab either of us. It all felt a bit random and pointless really (although the house of cards element was fun). And then it recently dawned on me that maybe the point of the game is not to 'win' but rather 'not to lose', and instead of trying to be number one, players should try and stay lower and pin the highest player into an awkward place so that they are forced to collapse the tower. A last-man-standing sort of scenario. The random dice element then plays second fiddle to a higher strategy. However, although I do see that this subtle shift in thinking tightened up the experience from my adult perspective, have you ever tried explaining that concept to a small child? It melts their brains...

Me: So son, in this game, you're not trying to win...
Son: ?
Me: You're trying 'not to lose'...
Son:?????? 
Me: Which means you will win...indirectly...
Son: *brain explodes*

And so at this point one has to wonder who this game is actually aimed at?

And if that is indeed the direction that HABA intended then why on earth didn't they explain that in the rules!! It's a very slight but important difference that can easily be overlooked. I realise that when playing with more than 2 there is more incentive to be at the top of the tower, as you won't win outright if another player is at the top and collapses the tower, but rather you will be one of 2 or more 'joint winners', but here my thoughts are based on the 2-player experience. 

Two tweaks: We play with a random set up for the base tiles. Not necessarily in a straight line, but have to be touching. We also play with two characters per player. More action that way :)  

Anyway, too much blurb for such a simple game. I'm off to play Mage Knight...much easier to get my head around that one.

This was a huge surprise pickup for me. You are dealt a couple of long cards that have symbols of walls on them. By choosing a long card, you have to incorporate the pictured wall to your turn as well. You are basically building a house of cards, and whoever destroys the house of cards on their turn loses the game.

Such a waste of great components! The original Rhino Hero was a simple Jenga-like affair of building up a tower. This one expands that to a whole precarious city block.

Rhino Hero is great fun for a silly dexterity game. Among those type of games, this is probably my favorite and is really good. I rate it a 6 purely because I don't often want to play this type of game. 

Still, I can imagine this is a fantastic game to play with children, and it can still be lots of silly fun for adult gamers in between the other standard fare.

RATING: 6
* Child rated

Bigger is better. The structure is so cool to build and look at! 

The super battle must have come with a theme tune because every time it happens we sing, "SUPER HEROOO, SUPERRR BATTLLLLLE." 

To prevent fights:
- Pre-super battle. If there's a disagreement for first player, use the red and blue dice. The aggressor picks the hand for a die.
- Ask what color rather than asking for character since everyone wants the main hero.

.:Best 3:.

My Notes
Rule 1: Build
As long as there's no major damage-
 monkeys, current wall and ceiling, and the floor being built on- it may be rebuild again.

Rule 2: Dice rolls- light blue
The dice rolls indicate what level you may go up to, rather than an exact level.

Also, if you are the last one on the ground floor and have not yet reached a level, keep rolling until you reach at least one level.

Rule 3: Out of Floor Cards
If all floor cards are used, everybody wins!

Haba really know how to make fun kids games. This one is much like the standard Rhino Hero except the tiles are bigger and longer aswell as two wall types, long and short. The cards/floor tiles display the walls you should play on your turn.As an added difficulty there is also monkeys which need to be placed hanging from the floor tile you have just played.It's just brilliant. The fun is through the roof and the tension builds and builds as the structure gets higher and higher.The blue dice allows the Heroes to climb the structure with the highest placed hero controlling the Silver badge.The trophy for being the highest hero.But be warned carelessness can see you losing the badge and the game.My kids just love playing this.It's made for them. Excellent game Haba.

I really like the way this adds more to the game. I think the creations become taller and more interesting. I also like the more definitive way a winner is decided. That being said there is still a decent amount of luck and randomness to the game. The dice rolls to see how high you get to move up on your turn (or even move down) isn't my favorite thing. I'm more OK with the battle roll to see whom gets to stay and whom gets bumped down. I wasn't a fan of people drawing floors that they couldn't place because of the walls. Instead of skipping their turn, why couldn't they keep drawing until they hit a playable floor? It's random and could really set a player back (which really hurts if they're already in last). It's a super short game that's a lot of fun, so its not as big of a deal with the randomness.

This is one of my favorite "fun for the whole family" games.  And of course it is from HABA.

This is a dexterity game of building a card house and climbing it with your little wooden animal super heroes.  Whoever is highest up the tower of cards has the medal and when someone knocks down the tower the medal-holder is the winner (unless they're the ones who knocked it down).  But we know the game isn't really about who wins.  It's about how tall or how crazy you can make the tower.  Lots of simple silly fun that resonates with almost everyone.

Fantastic update to Rhino Hero featuring his/her hero pals (Big E, Giraffe Boy and the Batguin). Not only does it amp up the the difficulty of building the tower, players are forced to move their hero figure up and down.

I've seen complaints about the fact that the player holding the medal is "winning" and this is determined by dice roll, but that's all irrelevant: this is a game building the tower to entomb that hero in a 7th floor room, requiring their hapless controller to delicately fish them out to avoid knocking down the tower. You don't want to be first.

The big downside is the unnecessarily enormous box; Rhino Hero's portable form factor was one of its biggest selling points but at this size has tough competition from Junk Art, Hamsterolle, Riff-Raff etc.

This takes the good parts of Rhino hero (stacking things), removes the bad parts (uno-style hand management), and takes it up a notch by allowing you to make huge structures.  Pretty amazing.

Each player has a die that they will roll to move up or down the structure and potentially fight other people.  This was super random, but still entertaining enough.  

I had a lot of fun, and this will probably replace the original Rhino Hero for me.

Perhaps Super Battle loses some of the original game's purity and kid-friendliness, but it more than makes up for it in sheer spectacle and the delight of building such a jumble of a structure only to let it all fall down. More devious than its predecessor as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial impressions are that it is a nice improvement on the original Rhino Hero.

This game gets rid of the Uno aspects of the original in favor of more standard stacking mechanics. You just build onto the structure then roll a die to see if you get to move your character. No more skip-a-turn or reverse turn order cards.

The larger structure is nice too. In the original game the stack could only get so tall before inevitably and predictably falling over. The base of the structure is wider in this version, so you can build for longer before falling over, making the game more dynamic and satisfying overall.

The biggest issue is the randomness of the dice rolls. The winner will largely be determined by a single die roll. If you roll poorly you might get stuck on the bottom level for most of the game, while someone else could shoot to the top because of the die. I'm hoping that somebody comes up with a strategic variant to replace the die roll. I'm thinking something like after building you always have the option to either move up by a single level, or roll the die. That would add a risk element and a chance to catch up if you're on the bottom level, but more conservative players could just move up one level at a time.

Overall it's a fun game that completely replaces the original.

Better than regular Rhino Hero, but worth the price? I don't know. I like it a lot. It should have come with 5-players out of the box though

Children's game. Super scales the original Rhino Hero and adds some freedom to the building. Adds also some unnecessary die rolling in the mix. The buildings look very nice after a couple of rounds.

High wow factor and table appeal.  Good dexterity game for the kids that adults can enjoy as well.

A worthy successor to Rhino Hero, adds multiple buildings that overlap, overhanging monkies and Super battles. I love it just as much as the original.

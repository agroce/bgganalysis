I really dislike the fact that every turn has NO bearing on next ones. instead of playing this is a game, you could just get a series of puzzles in the form of random board positions and 3 pieces, and a task to find a best score.  the game really is as shallow as that, there is nothing to tie your turns together (or even to other players' turns). for a simple 100% puzzle game it should be simultaneous like ricochet robots - who can first find the best move with shared playing pieces and one scoring pawn..

Charming short game, ideal for children learning addition as an educational game, but an interesting strategy game for adults too.

RATING: 5
Abstract stacking and placement game.  I saw it played and liked the premise but when I got to play it, it was just solid...luck of the draw seemed sort of heavy (and I don't mind luck).  It is colorful and I like the presentation.  It's also quick, which saves it.  So, yeah, after playing, it took some of the shine off but it's not a bad game.  Just not a great one for me.

I liked the fact that this game has a pretty unique look and feel to it, which instantly sets it apart from most and that is, to my mind, a good thing.  However, while interesting for that reason, the gameplay is a bit on the slow and puzzely side - too abstract for my tastes.

Excellent game, plays fast, but requires a bit of thinking.

This is a fun abstract Three Dimensional game. It's a little dry, but it's so different than everything else out there that it's just fun to play.
The art it great, too.

RATING: 7
Colourful 3D components and a great coffee-table piece of art when finished.

While the game is not my particular cup of tea (I'm a Euro boardgamer) I did find it quite fun and satisfying in searching the totem structue for the ideal spots in order to score a maximum number of points by hitting the target scores around the score track.  Recommended to play with 'closed holdings' to add tension and reduce any analysis paralysis ('open holdings' works just as well for a family friendly situation).

It's also a charming educational tool for children in basic maths and pattern forming.

RATING: 7
Quite fun actually and goes well with the kids (and teach them some maths too).

I can't fathom why they didn't put the colour wheel on the playing mat though?

The player and scoring pieces are way too small as, but easy to replace with something better.

Totemo is a great family game and have played it with my wife and she seemed to love the game (she is a non gamer).  It's very original and the components are great.  Can be played with the rules or just skipping them and playing until all blocks have been placed.  Can this this being a firm favourite with my son and daughter when they are older.

Played at Baycon 2013.  Won a copy in the competition (2013) which was nice surprise. :)

Really nice little abstract game, where you build totems of varying colours according to a colour wheel and score victory points. 

Colour wheel on the back of the rules book was slightly problematic and it would have been great if the colour wheel was present on the board or was separate from the rules as we were constantly having to flick through the rules and then back again to the colour wheel.

Sold in 2016.

RATING: 6
A 3D cube stacking game with some simple maths. Basically, you place a cube on the board each turn, scoring points for the cube itself and all adjacent cubes. Placement is restricted by adjacency rules according to the colour of the blocks, and bonus placements provide incentives for not simply finding the highest possible but a very specific score.

A nice, relaxing abstract.

I enjoyed trying this at BGG.con. The production is great looking and of quality. It is also a nice spacial reasoning puzzle game. I presume you could even play solo for high score, and maybe add a timer to add pressure to your own play. 

High price and need for international shipping will probably keep this out of my collection, sadly.

Bought because of Essen 2010 BGG video.

Great little game that looks as beautiful as it plays. The rules state that totem pieces in players' hands are secret but I reckon that showing what pieces you have may make the game a bit nastier which should suit the wife and me.

You have a hand of three blocks.  You place them either on top of another block or next to another block. Stacks may be no higher than five.  You score points from the block you placed and all the blocks it touches. Your block must not touch a color that isn't next to it on the color wheel. (ie: red may only touch red, purple or orange.) You may place additional blocks if your pawn lands on a bonus spot on the victory track.

My family loved this game.  A nice puzzle-like abstract.  Very attractive components.  Easy to learn, some tough decisions.  

I just wish the color wheel was printed on the game board, I'm surprised it isn't.  On one hand, it isn't hard to remember, but it would be nice to have the visual reminder right on the board rather than on a separate sheet in the rule book. The board certainly has room for it.

Totemo is one of these games that I find annoying and where I'm surprised that the general opinion is rather positive. On their turn, players have to place one of their three cubes in a three-dimensional matrix observing several restrictions and trying to score an exact number of points to end up on certain spots on the scoring board that allow another move. The problem is that the restrictions and drawn cubes often reduce the number of useful moves to a single one or even zero. Given averagely competent players that solve the posed puzzle on each turn in a sufficient way, it comes down to luck of the draw. What bugs me is the illusion of skill Totemo evokes. Too bad, as the game material is highly original and inviting to play with.

RATING: 6
Played 3 times, 2p, 3p, 4p.  Not a bad 3-D type stacking game with considerable strategy mixed in, but you are totally at the whim of the luck of the draw.  Whoever discards their blocks the least will win, and if nobody discards their blocks, it'll simply be whoever is setup best each turn, since your move will be pretty obvious every turn.  Pretty game, though.

RATING: 6
This game is almost purely tactical - don't bother looking much at the "3d" board until it is your turn.  Try to score in such a way that you can play multiple blocks.  Playing with blocks open for all to see can allow for more strategy as one might try to block but the game might also drag in that occurrence.  Found it light but fun.  Nice opener that goes for around 30 minutes.

Nice little game. Good filler and family game with a refreshing design (board is made of cloth!).

This is a more challenging game than it looks. So far I've mainly played it with casual gamers who all think it rather dry. I suspect it will go down better with serious gamers.

Great filler game. It has some thinking (you constantly want to place all 3 cubes), but is still light enough (calculations hardly go over 10 :-).
We play this regularly with our son (8 years old).

Wonderful, intuitive logical puzzle which matches off players of all experience levels very well. A great ice-breaker or family game. Although the teatowel-and-cloth-bag presentation is a very stylish touch, I have to confess to not being a fan of the artwork.

Apparently, I'm the first person ever to own a published copy. How cool is that?

Wow! Great, colorful, fun, 3D abstract game with northwestern American Indian overtones. This game really works! Play a block, score points, watch an opponent squirm because you cut them off ! Good for gamers, nongamers, families, young and old. Easy to learn and teach. Instant classic. Plays 2 to 4.

Casual game. Beer-n-pretzels game.

I like how the drawings on the cubes may assist players who may have a touch of color blindness.

I have enough trouble with 2d spatial stuff, so 3d was never going to suit me.  But the colour wheel system is neat and the "bonus play" mechanic is very clever indeed.  And the pre-production bits are splendid.
(Jun 11: Have pushed it up a point because I seem to have played a bunch of "abstracts" lately and this is just more fun than most of them.)

RATING: 1.5
If you consider using the "Ancient Art of Counting" as a strategy then this is a really deep game.  Otherwise, there is no game here.  Here is your decision tree: Can I place a block that will give me exactly as many points that will let me place again? If so, repeat.  If not place your block in the spot worth the most points.

Since when is it a real decision to choose between 5 or 8 points.  I'll always choose 8.  So your turn is spent hunting for the one spot that will make you the most points.  I'm not sure how my presence is needed for my turns to be played.  There is nothing to play, rather this is just an exercise in addition and color recognition.

.5 given because it looks kind of cool and it is fun to play with the bits.

I played this 7 months ago and somehow it eluded my play logging. As a consequence I'm just now rating it. Honestly, I don't really recall much of the game, though I recall not really caring for it. The rating is based off of my (vague) memories of the game, pending further play(s).

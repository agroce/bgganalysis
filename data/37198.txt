De este clasico esta todo dicho, es un juego muy facil, algo estrategico, pero en el que para mi la suerte influye mucho, si el dichoso dado no esta contigo, veras como la partida se te va. Luego es el tipico juego que cuando llevas 20 minutos jugados ya sabes quien tiene todas las papeletas para ganar. Es simple con lo que gusta jugar de vez en cuando por eso mismo por su simpleza. Pero es demasiado largo, a pesar de que con estas ediciones se añaden los objetivos y se puede reducir mucho las partidas.

The new style is very good - the rules, missions, rewards and so on - but why you have arrows troops? Tanks and/or infantry would be better suited for the theme.

RATING: 4.5
Stick with the original or Risk 2210, which is a far superior game.  A game like Risk needs to have plenty game dynamics and this version falls severely short.

It is a classic turned in to a more dynamic time saving and more strategic experience

I like the new victory conditions which do a good job of speeding the game up.  Sometimes you can finish the game in three turns, though, if the other players aren't very task-oriented.

The classic wargame... revised. It plays faster than the original. I found this in a Minneapolis Salvation Army thrift store, brand new and still sealed, for $8.

Recommended with 3-5 players (best 4-5). 90 mins.

RISK at its variant. Nothing to shout about. Nice minis on factories n capitals. Arrows as units look really cheap on board. Not to mention that its hard to pick up. Flat n glossed makes the worst combo if its a component that is used frequently. 

Added objectives n changes to cards for reinforcement do quicken up the game play. 4 players could be done in 2 hour dice feast. 

No enjoyment at all throughout the session. Obvious targets, obvious objective, obvious respond to threat. 

RISK is a game at its most basic and fails terribly with my group of gamers and kids. 

Tactics II is a much better substitute. 

For a time wasting, dice rolling, relaxation session.... Play this. Don't need to use brains at all ...... Makes this a light game.

Plays a bit faster and more cutthroat than original flavor Risk, which is really what you'd want more of from Risk.  Somewhere here I read that it's like "a knife fight in a phone booth," and I'd say that's a good description.  It is a bit of a challenge adjusting your strategy to objectives rather than conquest, though.

Good grief, 50 years and [i]this[/i] is what the Hasbro brain trust came up with to update one of their most popular titles? This is [i]it[/i]?

Summary: You get a point the first time you control a continent. You don't lose it if you subsequently lose control of that continent. You can't get two points for the same continent. First one to three points wins.

OK, actually, for "continent" you can read a slightly more diverse set of objectives (take over ten territories in one turn, control a certain number of city tokens which are put out randomly at start, in addition to the continent thing), and for "point" you can read "point plus a minor special power". And there are a few other minor tweaks. But really, that's it.

I mean, OK, it's not a terrible update; it's not bad at all. It's sort of what Antike should have been. But it's incredibly conservative, especially considering how brilliant the two Star Wars Risk games were. For me personally, I'd much rather play this than a ton of games that are popular with the BGG crowd: Nexus Ops, Antike, Twilight Imperium, Struggle of Empires, etc. And it's better than the very overwrought late-90s tie-ins, Godstorm and 2210. Risk is a classic game, and arguably doesn't really need an update, but the things is that great ideas to expand the appeal of the base game are [i]already out there[/i]. Adding team play from the Star Wars games alone would have added immensely to the value of this package. Adding some flavorful action cards would have been great. As it is, I dunno. Risk is a fun game under the right circumstances, and this updated version does help somewhat. But 50 years on I'd expect better, and I'll probably just stick with Star Wars Risk to the extent that I have a desire to play Risk, which is some but not much.

I do quite like the new look of the game, though, especially the army pieces. The abstracted armies and cities give it sort of a minimalist industrial, modern look that I think is appropriate. It's not awesome, but it is a mass-market game. I actually think the $25 mass-market version is somewhat nicer than the slightly odd Black Ops promo game. Only the strange "rulebook" format seems like a complete misfire.

Of the three Hasbro "updates" - Risk: Revised, Clue: Discover the Secrets, and Monopoly City - none are great, but this a weaker one.

A definite improvement over the original, although it's too bad they couldn't maintain the same aspect of cardplay--they still have the cards, with the same motifs, but they don't work the same anymore.  Game is much shorter, although it is possible for the game to degenerate into the same "world conquest" mode under the right circumstances.

RATING: 10
Use soldier/tank/cannon/airplane figures from ATTACK! game instead of little arrows.  Use a neutral country when playing 2 player and give them an extra 4 tanks, 4 cannons, and an airport at their capitol.  Card draw determines player's and neutral's territories, location of capitols, and location of factories. Opponents and neutrals receive the same number of factories in their territories. Solder = 1 / tank = 5 /cannon = 10 / airplane = airport.  I may use Battleship naval pieces in a future variant.

It feels strange giving such a low rating because this game helped get me and my friends into gaming but it can become a bit of a slog and I absolutely hate games with player elimination. Thankfully it did lead me to looking into, and getting other games. I love playing games because they're fun. Sitting and watching other people roll dice after you've been eliminated isn't fun and I don't think I've played a game of risk with more than two players where people are happy at the end. If one of my friends desperately wants to play I will but I'd never recommend or suggest it.

I've only played this 2 players so far, but it's a lot of fun.  It's a bit simple, but it's great for a fast, light war game -- if I want something more complex, I always have Runewars.

Players recruit troops and conquer the world.  The revised version of the classic Risk, and it is much much better for it.

I need to play this again.  My initial rating is poor but I feel that this is most likely unjustified.  This game really needs to have a specific mind set in place to even approach it.  Having been involved in an Agricola-thon the transition wasn't the smoothest.  Plus the game was played accommodatingly by a friend who does not care for such titles, so the enthusiasm or joy one gets from such offerings began at a low gear.  I disagree with the criticisms on the graphic design, I like the new approach. I also think the mission objectives is a strong step in the right direction.  With this all said however, my first game was pretty horrible.

The first player has won every time we have played (I haven't played this one very much, though). It hasn't even been close (we gave the second player two cards and the third player three cards). However, it might be better with 4 or 5 players instead of 3.

update: We recently played a game where we changed the cards that were distributed at the start. This is how we did it: the first player got nothing, the second player got 2 cards, the third player got 3 cards, and the fourth player got 4 cards. The first player still won. One play obviously isn't enough to prove anything, so I'll try this a few more times ... if that doesn't work, I'll change the bonuses to 3/4/5 for players 2/3/4 or maybe even 4/5/6 for players 2/3/4.

Can play classic rules or incorporate objectives and/or rewards.  THe objectives pull the game length down, mercifully.

Nice twist on a classic game. Objectives do a good job of speeding up the game, and have a nice "catch-up" mechanic with the "take xyz things in one turn" objectives. The card system is also greatly improved, no more violent swings from card combos. However, the game is still mostly luck, and the initial setup can make or break a game. A great addition for any risk fan. Those that despised risk won't find anything new, however.

I had no idea this version existed until I found it in the used section at my local game store and I just knew I had to have it. As an avid risk fan with a minor collection I love everything about this version. had my first play with my Nephews on Sunday, loved the big glossy board, loved the wooden components, loved everything about this edition of RISK. I am only bummed the Onyx Edition is a "version" of the 2008 Revised Edition, it almost deserves its own BGG Entry.

I own the amazing Onyx edition. Very nice wooden board with very nice pieces, but a very large box as well. I added the blocks from my other two old games, one even had a 6th player (pink). The minor & major objectives with hidden rewards & the randomly placed cities make this one of my favorite alterations to the original Risk. They make the game shorter by just being the first to achieve three objectives, but we usually play it out to world domination. 

I also have two house rules I sometimes like to use to spice things up. I like the Italian defending die rules where the defender can also defends with 3 die, making it a little harder to take over a territory. However, the cities & objectives help counter people trying to turtle & encourage you to try to achieve objectives. Normally the person who achieve the most the fastest ends up wining in out 2-4 player games. If you don't attack you will be overpowered & conquered. I also like the house rule of having every army piece be able to move over one territory, for multiple territories, rather than only moving armies form one territory to the other. Each army can only move one spot, but it helps reinforcing areas and allows aggressive attacking & spreading out armies as a second wave of defense or offense. I feel this is a better simulation of how armies actually move.

Objectives improve the original; it's now playable in a couple of hours or less. It's true that there isn't a ton of tactical play to be had, but for a light and relatively quick-playing area control wargame it works. This version uses little plastic arrows instead of soldiers, which are both hard to pick up and visually unappealing. Risk should have toy soldiers, dammit!

So glorious and awesome. The wooden pieces are solid and feel great, and the cities and objectives (which were new to me when buying this version) add a lot to the standard Risk flair. 

The real gem of this version though is the amazing wooden board. It is so incredibly nice and well done. I wish there wasn't an issue with the map, where Greenland doesn't connect to Europe, but that's a minor issue all things considered and can be fixed by yourself if you really want to. The fact that it is raised slightly off the table gives it an extra bit of presence.

The quality of production is rather poor - the map on my copy is inaccurately cut, the cards are very thin and the rattly plastic bits feel a bit cheap. It doesn't stand up to my 80s "star pieces" edition which is still going strong after many plays, and I think that, physically, it will long outlast this version. Though both are abstract, I prefer the 80s bits. The new rules "file" is a gimmick, though it works well enough. The objective tokens are made of thinnish card that needs to be separated from its "sprue" with care as the printed paper separates easily.

All in all, not a great production, even if play has improved.

Classic game of frustation and betrayal! 

If you play with the "goals" of the revised version it still can be fun and fast. 

If you play to "conquer the world" the strategy is allways the same: Take australia, and then the result depens on if the rest of the players become allies or not, then the winner will be the first to betray the rest.

I play once a year and have fun, but I rather play other games.

A re-design of classic Risk that introduces Objectives and Rewards.

Combat is handled just as in the classic but the introduction of cities and Capitals changes how troops are drafted. 

The use of the cards earned by winning combat is also altered. 

It all amounts to a slightly more Euro feel but this is still definitely an Ameritrash\Combat dominated title. The biggest change is that the game length is significantly reduced. Where classic Risk would take 3 odd hours or more, a game of this should never take more than 90 minutes.

In other words...this is Risk for the modern day short attention span and time poor individual. That doesn't make it a bad thing but gaining a win here can be done a little more easily by stealth than the classic Risk allowed for and that may leave some people feeling a little cheated at times.

2 hours is a long game for Revised Risk, so it's much improved over the original in that regard. The objectives and cities make the game that much more interesting. 

In our first play however, a situation occurred where a player started in Australia, ventured out for 2 quick objectives AND the defense die, then holed up there and waited until he had 30+ troops before going out many turns later and claiming the third. He was nearly impossible to dislodge from anywhere on the board. I don't think this should occur frequently, but if it does I may need to adjust the rating accordingly.

I actually like the arrow bits and the blood-red board.

RATING: 6
I never liked the original "Risk" (do the same darn thing over and over, seemingly to infinity), but with victory conditions involving achieving objectives rather than trying to conquer the whole bloody planet, this revised version is much more palatable. I got it as a Christmas present for my 9-year-old (2008), finding this at half-price plus 20% off at a local department store. I really like the innovative rules folder, with separate 'pages' on card stock that nicely fit into a sleeve. The rules are clearly written and illustrated. My rating of this version is 6, which is pretty good, considering my rating of the original Risk would probably be a "2," as in 'extremely annoying, would probably never play this again.' 'Annoying' is a good word for the original. This is still a simple, mass-market game, but it's now reasonable to play for what it is--about 90 minutes in all. Ultimately, for me, however, this is still "Risk," which means there are many other, better, more interesting war games out there. So, I gave it to someone who wanted to present it to someone else as a Christmas gift.

RATING: 8
Very good variation of classic Risk. This is a combination of Mission Risk and Capitol Risk that gels well. It has all of the elements of a typical Risk game but plays quickly. There is potential for player/official expansions with additional 'missions' and rewards. Player elimination remains (especially in the 5 player game) as an option. Excellent implementation. The rules are simple enough that this is a great introduction to better gaming.

Might be time to put the original to rest.

Note: I hate the color scheme - should have gone with the Black Ops colors.

Note II: The Onyx edition is simply the best looking Risk game ever (the map is Black ops with a blue ocean). The components are fantastic. The coloring is actually better than in Black Ops. Great job. (I am aware of the missing link on the map. They ran into the same problem with the 40th Anniversary edition though that was a different link.) For components -10.

** When I played this version for the first time, I did not care for it much. After repeated plays, the game has grown on me. It retains the simplicity of the classic game while playing in a significantly more fluid manner. It improves with each playing.

A childhood favorite. I spent long hours playing this with siblings and friends. Back then there was something inexplicably thrilling about endless dice-rolling bouts between giant armies amassed in Australia. I haven't played it in a long while, so that thrill may still be there...

This new edition appears to be an attempt at evolving the game by abstracting its theme (which to me seems unnecessary) and adding new victory conditions. I'm not sure whether this helps Risk become something new and relevant, or weakens it by distancing its simple origins. In any case, the new cities, capitals and arrow tokens don't add all that much to the game, and it remains Risk, whether it is supposed to be or not.

Sure, it's simple. Also, you can be playing a great game and get screwed over because everyone attacks you (or nobody attacks the strongest player, etc.) But if you look at all of the politics of it as part of the game, it's really fun. The end of the game can be quite tense sometimes.

I've been a fan of Risk since about 1970 or so.  It was a favorite for years, but it's one I haven't played much for years.  I'd hate to see Classic Risk disappear, but this looks like a welcome addition to the Risk cannon, and one that I expect to hit my table soon.  Nice materials: mounted folding board, odd attack arrow pieces that look like they're from a military history atlas, thick cardboard marker tiles, no rulebook per se (rules are on a handful of cards in a rules folder), city and capitol pieces, and, of course, dice.  Designed to play in half the time (or less) of vanilla Risk.  Looks like fun.  I'll let you know.

I love Risk! It's a simple, fun strategy game. I love the added rules such as the cities and the rewards you get for completing the objectives. My only gripe is those awful AWFUL arrow pieces they used in replace of the Cannon, Calvary and Solider. They can be set as 1 or 3 piece instead of 1, 5 and 10. You'll run out of pieces within a few turns, no joke! And they take up so much room, it's inconvient and unnecessary! We always dig out older pieces from the Risk game released prior to this version.

I'm honestly surprised to be rating a Risk game a "9" - I was introduced to Risk after cutting my teeth on A&A and Samurai Swords, and found very little to like in a bland game that took just as long my gems of AT.

Even having read the reviews and bought the game with high expectations, I was still amazed by how much I enjoyed my games - that is to say, the two games I played the first night I managed to get this onto the table(!)

I'm not quite sure how to describe the damn-near alchemical transmutation that Risk, As We Knew It, has undergone.  Rob Daviau is a genius for refining the simplistic Risk-engine into a game with tactical texture and strategic grandeur that plays in 1-2 hours.

It's possible I'll be less enchanted on future plays, but I suspect it's more likely it'll find its way up to 10, as it's simple, fast, and fairly easy to get non-gamers to play

It's nice to see Risk brought into the modern gaming fold. All of the changes (aside from the weird army tokens) made in this new edition of the game are fantastic. Everyone hates vanilla Risk for obvious reasons, but the new edition has addressed most of what was wrong in the classic version of the game. You now play to complete objectives instead of eliminating other players and the objectives themselves provide bonuses that tend to accelerate the game to a conclusion. While it's still not as good as some of the themed editions that are out there, the new rules do bring the game up to speed with the likes of Nexus Ops and D.U.S.T.

So I don't want to hunt down a copy of Black Ops for the prices wanted.  This version does everything that Black Ops does and for a fraction of the cost.  This is a good streamlined version of classic Risk and hopefully will become the new standard.

Objectives make the game shorter, but it's still Risk.

New and Currently un played and still in shrink wrap. I am not really looking to trade this but if the right offer was made I would consider it.

Prefer the shorter objective and bonus oriented design to classic, although kind of miss the 6th player.

Fixes the original's issues and significantly improves the playing experience.  I went for the Onyx Edition since I don't care for the arrow troops in the "standard revised" version.

Nice update to a classic game. I like the new art.

Good strategy game, but there is a lot of luck involved due to the dice. Does not stop it from being fun though.

The win condition events make this much quicker to play and removes the player elimination problem.

A men on maps game that is heavily luck dependent, but we've toiled away many afternoons arguing and betraying each other in our conquests to rule the world.

I always loved Risk growing up, but don't enjoy player elimination and going for world domination usually dragged on too long. This 2008 version introduces capitals and alternative objectives. If you complete 3 of the objectives you are crowned the winner. However, I would highly recommend Risk Legacy over this version.

TRADE INTEREST: VERY HIGH

A 2-5 player, world conquest, wargame where the goal of the game is to take over the world using clever area control and tactical advances. 

Have enjoyed many different risk versions and own 3 myself, but need to make room for others in my collection!

Used, and in excellent condition.

I wouldn't have thought the mythic ordeal of Risk susceptible or even worthy of fixing. But here it is. And, although it's difficult to explain this fact historically: the modifications  work naturally.  

It's as though the edition we've been using for the last 40 years was an unfortunate mis-print; they just finally got around to editing in all the errata. "--Oh yes, did we forget to add the point that you don't need to take over the whole planet?" It's tempting to hold a grudge for all those 3 AM stalemates I've endured over the last 25 years. But despite myself I'm reminded of everything I always liked about the game.

Player elimination is still an essential problem. In fact, the built-in acceleration mechanisms now mean that poorer players die a lot faster. And more frequently. And player elimination can't be used as a game end condition for those very reasons. Nonetheless,  because her holdings are accumulated by a loser's vanquisher, the whole event ends faster. Thus, no need for back-up social plans--losers will only have to wait 20 minutes for a chance at reprisal.

Further, while elimination used to mean brute attrition with dice over Asia, the new capitals, cities, and objectives repay the attentive player in ways that can dramatically alter the tide. There is both more entropy and more scope for strategy, and enough complexity that your opponent may not see you coming.

And this is why I enjoy it so much. The great thing about Risk was grand combat with enough strategy to guarantee victory to the best general on *most* nights, but enough chance to interest an upstart commandant who's been down on her luck. Here, there is more of both, with none of the hours-long stalemates, and bonus: everyone already knows the board, the mechanics, and the gameplay; so you're not going to waste a half hour explaining rules.

It really pains me to recommend a game that has grossed more profit over the decades for less design and production effort than almost any other besides Monopoly. But I have to accept life as it is.  Rob Daviau deserves kudos for this edition. Let go of geek elitism, grab a mass-produced copy for less than $25 at the big box store on the way over and enjoy life!

Risk is dead! Long live Risk!

The immortal classic is given an overhaul. This time the goal is to earn "badges" by achieving face up goals randomly dealt to the table. Each goal also nets you a reward when earned. There's also cities which act as territory doublers, capitals which you need to defend in order to stay victory eligible, and revamped card rules that make it a titch eaiser to earn new troops. This version is built for speed, with new troops perhaps being earned a bit too quickly. And yea, the troops are represented by arrows now. If you want, the old fashioned total domination rules can still be used here.

My rating is for the Risk Onyx Edition version.  Have it slightly above some other Risk versions only because of the quality of the board in the Onyx Edition.  It has 2 major mistakes on the board connecting countries, but Risk players know what connects and the raised wooden board more than makes up for it.  The new objectives style of the game is completely unnecessary and ruins the game of Risk, but the cities and capitals are nice to incorporate.  Quality board for playing classic Risk with house rules added in.

I should replace this with Risk: Legacy, but whatever. I used to play Risk all the time with my dad, brother, and my Dad's best friend. Great memories, and frankly, my gateway game. And this version has an achievement based win condition, which makes it actually playable.

"It's over?" Yes, thanks to the new objectives introduced in this revised edition you'll feel slightly relieved to know that games play out pretty quickly. Complete any 3 and you win so forget about global domination. You'll probably even want revenge if you got hammered the last time around, but unfortunately, and as usual with Risk, it doesn't matter how well you device your strategy; it's all up to your dice roll. In spite of this it provides a good experience and should appeal to those who grew up with in-your-face kind of games. I was disappointed to see that the army figures were replaced by bland, non-threatening arrows. Apparently they're used to indicate which two territories are in conflict, but setup is too much of a hassle to align them each time.

Open objectives are interesting, and there is more flexibility in playing reinforcement cards now, which is nice since their pacing tended to dictate the game's flow a bit too much in the original. Very fast, too, which is a huge plus for Risk-type games.

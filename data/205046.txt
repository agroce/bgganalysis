The game had a rough start (I taught three players to play, plus myself -- two of them bailed and then another joined in mid-game), but suffice it to say, I think the mechanics look interesting and I'd like to give this one another shot. As it is, traded it away.

3 plays / 3 players

LIKE: Lots to think about and good interaction, waiting for another player to increase the value of a stack you want increased is nice and tense. I like the simple actions. I also like the hidden plus/minus cards that effect each group.

DISLIKE: Random card draws could lead to a random swing, but really you could play it either way. Also, a player could be just stuck with lousy cards and not have any way to catch up, but it's a short game.

OVERALL: I like this game. You can compete or put pressure on different categories just before scoring. I feel that it is not as epic as Biblios, maybe because the scoring is not a big surprise (as in Biblios), so perhaps having a bit of swing in the modifier cards would be more interesting.

Not a fan of the art, though it is definitely original. However, the game has an unsuspected "take that" element, where you are satisfied because you outsmarted the other player.

Fun card game. A little hard to figure out who is in the lead, or if you can do anything about it, but I would gladly play more of it.

Seems like there's a lot of strategy if you can figure it out, which is great for a card game.

Really enjoyed playing with a "mistake" variant, where the most powerful card in the capital goes to the winner's village, not a face-down scoring pile.  A lot more tension as they have to work really hard to defend their newfound strength!

RATING: 8
Simple mechanics: play a card to your tableau or play a card to the capital, taking its special action.  Your aim is to have lower value sets in your tableau than in the capital, but a higher value than your opponents.  Card drafting at the start of each round helps to build the hand you need and offers knowledge of other cards in play.  Naturally, those special actions and the other players will mess with your calculations.  This simple framework supports a quick,  mean and thinky game.  I like it very much.

Production quality is good, the card art isn't great, but it's functional.  The English rules are decent.

Card games have been around forever and it can be hard to envision something new.  This game feels like it is, but also like it is an update of an older design with new art.  To the best of my knowledge, it's completely new - so that means the game pulled off feeling "classic" and that's a positive sign.  The game play is quite good and game length appropriate.  Players really must watch the capital so as not to get shut out of points.  If you get caught, the effects can be substantial!  Card art is fun but has nothing to do with the game play.  The game also has "square discs"... (see images).  No idea, but somewhere in production a change was made.  It makes no difference, but it is amusing to pick up a square block and call it a gold disc.  Worth playing and a fun filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent filler, simple, quick, tight. But the title Capital Lux is annoyingly forgettable and meaningless and you could swap around the names of the four suits - Cleric, Scholar, Merchant and Agent – without making any difference to the game. It would help new players if the cards gave some indication of what they do.
I think I'd have preferred this as a pure abstract.

This feels like a classic card game, and I say this because it is elegant, it's slim and trim and has a surprising arc to the gameplay as you play. Cards played in front of players are not discarded at the end of a round, nor are the ones played to the centre. This has a drastic and increasing effect on how you draft the cards each round and what your main concerns are. Given the limited number of each card, the removal of certain cards drastically shifts the power or potential of each of the 4 "suits", further complexing your decisions by the final round.

A classic.

This simple card game is intriguing, while still being very accessible. The rules are pretty simple: draft a hand of cards with a number and color, play cards to your city or to the capital which gives a bonus but doesn't help your score, and then at the end of the round, you get to keep your cards for each color as long as you have a lower total than the capital. To win, you are generally trying to have the highest number possible in each color, without losing them.

A simple mix of push your luck and card playing strategy, I found this one very interesting and loom forward to my next play.

RATING: 7
One of those fillers that simple to learn, but offers tough choices.  There is only two things you can do on your turn... add a card to your tableau, or play it as a shared card in the capitol.  The capitol dictates the max point value anyone can have for that color.  Super simple, but offers some agonizing choices!  I really like the artwork on this one as well.  This looks like a keeper for sure, and I could see this becoming a filler of choice!

RATING: 7
A clever card game, which packs some tough decision making into a very simple rule set. You draft a hand of cards, and then either play them to your personal town (cards in your town will usually score for you) or to the middle of the table.

At the end of the round, whoever has the most of each suit without exceeding the cards in that suit that were played to the middle of the table will score bonus points. If your card total in a suit exceeds those played to the center of the table, you lose all your cards in that suit.

So, it ends up being a very tricky game of trying to play as many points in front of yourself as you can, without exceeding the cards played to the center. When you play to the center, you're also granted a special ability depending on the suit, which firther plays into the tough decisions.

Neat game, and also really visually appealing with Kwanchai's great illustrations.

Nicely incorporates a couple of design elements from other games into a cohesive, collective whole.  Plenty of mind games and 'mathy' type of decisions.  Only detractor for me and those I've taught the game so far, is the art style, which I know is a highlight for others.

An okay game that takes a little bit to explain how the scoring in the game works. Either play cards to your tableau for personal points or play to the center for a special action. As long as the total of cards in the center is less than or equal to your personal tableau you score points by taking a card from the middle. While the game tries to present interesting dilemmas we all just felt that the game was playing us and nothing felt like a good decision. It may be that playing this game multiple times with the same group would help everyone understand the turn decisions better, but I just don't see that happening with all the other great fillers out there.

Clever game of trying to maximize points in your "hometown" while not exceeding the points for each color played to the common capital area. Playing to the capital grants special actions that can throw a monkey wrench into your opponents' plans.  Best to try to remain nimble so the changing landscape in the center doesn't completely tank your plan. The draft helps mitigate this somewhat, especially with 3 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Enjoying all of my plays of this game thus far. I think I preferred this game slightly more with 4 players. The drafting levels the playing field a bit by giving players with a bad starting hand the chance to pass off their bad cards to opponents. There is also the decision of whether to use a card for its special ability (and not receive points) or place it in front of you to score points (if you don't exceed the limits).

I love tableau building games and card-play in general! The more you play this game the more you can understand it's cleverness. It provides some very tense decisions. It's a bit "mathy" which may turn off some but honestly were talking about numbers than equal less than 15 here most of the time. If you have a decent memory you can deduce what cards your opponents have based on the draft which can lead to some very satisfying plays.

This is one of the few games where I'll find myself with a stupid grin on my face after someone plays right into a "trap" you set.

Cool looking game, nice art on the cards.  I've played this a bunch of times, and it is a nice, light card game.  

But the odd thing (and it's not just me) is that none of us have any idea who will win the game based on the flow of the game.  I'll think things are working out well and then come in last.  And visa versa.  On multiple plays, the winner is a bit surprised.

But that doesn't really detract much.  It's a cool game with interesting decisions.

When trying to explain this game to my friend, I said something similar to this: it's kind of like playing a multiplayer blackjack game where each player can play the dealer or player and each suit has unique powers. Basically, in each of the three rounds, players are going to be drafting cards and then playing them to 'the house' or in front of them. When you are playing them to the house, you're increasing the ceiling of that suit for all players to have in front of them and you get to use that factions unique ability. When you're playing a card in front of you, you're doing it for scoring purposes. At the end of the round, if you exceed the house, you discard all cards of that suit. If you're equal to or under, you keep the cards and whoever has the most value in that suit will take the highest card from the house into their score pile (different than tableau). Each suit is evaluated this way. Tableaus and the house remain between each round. After 3 rounds, you count up the value of your score pile and tableau and most points win.

This is a somewhat strange game when you first hear about it. It's really intriguing and I've enjoyed my plays thus far. It's nice to have a suits and numbers game with special powers. If anything I've said seems interesting, I'd definitely give it a try.

Interesting idea where you try to balance points played in front of you with the cards played to the centre, have too many in front of you and you will lose them all.
Theme is nonexistent but game play is solid and there are some real choices to be made at both the draft stage (higher numbers not always good) and again at the play stage.
I like the art style and this is interesting enough to warrant more plays.

Surprisingly descent draft/tableau/majority card game. And gorgeous art (well, 5 drawings total but still).

I didn't know what to expect with this one, but was pleasantly surprised. It's fiddly enough to not be an easy sell on relative non-gamers, but with enough patience to put a couple plays under your belt, I found Capital Lux intriguing.  It clearly will reward multiple plays to grasp the subtleties of the draft and the roles.

For me this game falls in the same category as Lost Cities and Schotten-Totten; as in small simple card games that give you difficult decisions each turn. Both the drafting and playing of cards are very tense. Timing is paramount and you have to try to outguess your opponent.

Its amazing how simple and sleek the design is. The art is also very cool, love the scifi paintings which remind me a bit of Bill Sienkiewicz's works.

Interesting dilemma between playing to the capital for special actions and potentially helping everyone and playing to your own tableau for points but with the risk of losing everything. Player order is pretty huge for the majorities for scoring (or even razing entire stacks with nobody able to react) but the game is really short so I can let a little swinginess slide. Nice one.

Capital Lux is a set collection card game with a black jack style bust element. Play a card of a suit choosing to try to score it or use that suits ability. If the total of your attempted score cards are below the total of cards played on that suit for its ability, you are safe. Decisions are simple, yet engaging and the game works well. Like many fillers of this style, it has just a few tweaks to differentiate itself, but Capital Lux does a good job of standing out. Balance-wise, it seems if a player busts once, they are immediately out of the running. That is unfortunate, but it is fun trying get as close as possible to the goal number without going over.

Beneath the simple exterior you will find a brutal game. You can play it very casually, but if you are a seasoned card/board game player you'll discover that Capital Lux can offer really unexpected levels of interaction and a lot of decision/prediction/theory of mind gameplay.

This is a very simple card game that plays fast and has some satisfying decision points. The main tension is that on your turn you can play a card either into the centre of the table (the Capital) or your tableau (your Hometown). Cards come in 4 suits and have ranks from 2 to 6. If you play in the Capital you get a bonus action depending on the suit. 

At the end of the round you check for each suit if the sum of ranks for that suit in your Hometown exceeds the sum in the Capital. If it does you discard all cards of that suit from your Hometown. The values of cards in your Hometown are points at the end of the game.

There are few more wrinkles, such as the various bonus actions that help you manipulate things. It's a clever little system of guess work and riding other people's coat tails. It's over in about 20 minutes and for the time spent you got a lot of gaming value. 

Looking forward to more plays when someone local picks up a copy.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I really enjoyed this clever filler. Four different color cards and each color has a special ability associated with it if played to the central capital. If played to your personal tableau, it must not be of higher value than the total value of those cards of the same color at the capital or you lose all your cards of that color. For each color you lead in value, you snag the card from the capital of the highest value for end game scoring. At the end, you also score all the values of your cards in your tableau. There is definitely some fun manipulation, bluffing, push your luck, etc that can occur and the game is really cleverly simple.

Simple rules, but has interesting decisions to make - when to add to the Capital or your Hometown, which cards to keep each round, and how to use the special abilities in the most advantageous way.  Will likely take a couple of plays to really grasp the various tactics in the game.  Surprisingly think-y for such a basic card game with only a few special abilities.  Due to how the cards are drafted each round, you have a good idea of a decent percentage of the cards that will be in play and that will shape the decisions you make.  Involves a balancing act of needing to use your cards for the special abilities, but you also need to use cards to score points.  Appears to be a very clever game.

(3/17) 8. Really enjoy this game.  It feels Biblios-y to me, but I'm not exactly sure why.  Maybe just because it's a tight, rules light, depth heavy card game?  Which is a genre that I really do love, with Biblios and Arboretum being the reigning champs. I don't think Capital Lux is QUITE there, but it's not too far off.

(10/17) 8. The third leg of the holy trinity that I see as Biblios/Arboretum/Capital Lux where you've just got a deck of cards and agonizing decisions just keep coming.  However this is clearly the weakest of the three.  Still that's pretty fantastic company.

Fun card game. Balancing between what you play in the middle (and get a special action) and what you play in front of you (potentially scoring points). But if the number in front of you is higher than in the middle, you loose out. Fun filler.

Simple (and beautiful) cards create an unexpectedly complex game with clever interactions.  Nicely tactical with some room for bluffing and tricky timing.  Quick setup and small footprint.  With two players, it's not as competitive as I would like.  With four players, there's some potential to be mean.

I was pleasantly surprised by this area control card game that asks very little of players in terms of rules overhead, but has a lot of fascinating emergent gameplay through the decision to play cards either into the Capital or into your Hometown. Works best, I think, as a 3-4p game.

Clever filler game. You want to have the most points in each suit without going over the amount in the center of the table, and there's a smidgen of hidden information to deal with. Fairly unique in its execution, and the draft helps to mitigate the luck somewhat.

I have plays with a gamer and two non-gamers in and I can definitely see that it's one that is easy to pick up with a great amount of strategy. The special abilities have a nice balance to them. The art on all the cards looks great. One of the minor downsides to it though is the lack of theme. Yes, it's an abstract, but with such detailed art and terminology like the capital and hometown, you would think that the rules would give a fun backstory behind what the cards meant and the context of the cards.

[b]Capital Lux[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]I knew a little about this going in and was looking forward to checking it out. This is a very clever card game that can go off the rails quick, I got trounced my first game because I didn't fully grasp how the scoring would work out. We decided to play a second time and my initial hesitation was washed away, my thoughts that there was a rich get richer issue were unfounded and I quite enjoyed playing again. 

You have a lot of information because there is a card draft, but there are just enough unknowns to make the game unpredictable yet not random. There is a bit of an area control feel, however there are other ways to score points besides having majorities which opens up the scoring opportunities. Despite the draft and majority scoring the game doesn't feel very interactive in it's execution. Yes you can effect the scoring in the capital which in turn effects your opponent, but you always feel like your action can be undone by your opponent. 

[i]Comparison to Hanamikoji:[/i]

Looking back I prefer the interaction in Hanamikoji which made for more agonizing decisions. I guess what I found missing in Capital Lux was the urgency found in Hanamikoji. It could simply be the fact that Hanamikoji could end after one round while Capital Lux has a set number of rounds that are played. 

Overall a very fun play session although I think the game would be even better with more than two players. It played well with two, but more with more players it wouldn't be a zero sum game. I will gladly play this again with more players [i](hopefully at our game night)[/i], but will probably choose to buy Hanamikoji because it plays better with two and the game play feels more tense.[/i]

I'd been hearing good things about this for a while and really liked it. It feels a bit like a fleshed-out version of Khmer/Elements. As in Khmer, you are trying to collect the biggest set without going over a limit set by the players, but in four suits at a time and with a mild dose of special powers.

I just did not enjoy this one. Not sure why, but it felt so uncompelling. Maybe the theming just didn't hit me, but, yeah, no joy in play. The artwork is gorgeous -- it reminded me a little of comics artist Christian Ward -- but as far as actual play, I dunno, I'd rather just dive into Uno -- which, on its surface, this reminded me of a more complicated version of.

tl;dr: better than I expected

So, to start: the theme is completely pasted on. You play numbered cards in 4 different colors, that's the real theme. Doesn't bother me though, it's rather engaging.
The game is pretty basic: numbered cards in 4 colors. Either play them in front of you or in the center. The goal is to have the highest value in front of you (color majority scoring) but not to match or exceed the value of that color in the center. Playing cards in the center also lets you perform the special actions that are tied to every color.
So yeah, that is pretty basic, but it just works very well.

Initial rating: 7/10
BGG scale: 7/10

Pretty light but enjoyable card play. Just the right amount of depth for the length of the game. I started to see a little bit of previously unnoticed depth towards the end of the game that makes me want to explore it more.

First play impression: Wow! This is the best game I've played in a while.

I was afraid it would be a little too much like Imhotep, Splendor, or similar games where you take one action on a turn and hope for the best. Capital Lux is indeed one of those "one action at a time" type of games, but you feel like you have more control than in those other games. That's because of two main factors:

First is the card draft. You have a pretty good idea of what the other players can do because you see the cards you pass along, just like in any 7 Wonders-style draft. If you pass along a hand full of blue cards, then the other players will be playing blue cards.

The second aspect of control is the interplay of the card abilities. While drafting and playing cards, you can think ahead and try to leave yourself open to accomplishing your goals in different ways. This is a little hard to explain without going into a full rules explanation, but basically the timing of when you play your cards and the way you play your cards (either into the middle of the table or onto your own tableau) has a big impact on the game. You can make a seemingly suboptimal play early in the round, but it might leave you flexible to change up your strategy later in the round if somebody screws up your plan A.

It actually has a similar feel to another recent card game, Zany Penguins, because you draft cards and then score points based on playing them in certain ways. For me this could be a Zany Penguins killers, because ZP can also feel a little too chaotic.

It may be worth noting that my one game so far was with three players. This game feels like it wouldn't work very well with two players because card drafting and fighting for majorities just don't work well with two, but it should be fine with four.

Really just an excellent game.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
The main mechanisms here are 7 Wonders-style card drafting and color majorities. Both mechanics that don't work with two players.

This feels like one of those tavern games they always stick in computer RPGs as a side quest. I guess if I had to label it, it's sort of like playing four hands of blackjack simultaneously, but with extra game effects triggered by the suit of the cards played to the dealer's hand. Both the player's hands and the dealer's hands are perpetual from round to round as well, making long-term considerations as important as the immediate odds. If you bust and go over the dealer's hand, all cards of that suit in your tableau are lost and discarded. After three rounds of play, all cards in your tableau that did not get discarded are totaled at their face value and the high score wins.

While that general overview already sounds great, what makes the game shine are the two things I left out. The first one being that the dealer's hand is built by the players through out the game. On your turn, you can play a card either to your hand, or the dealer's. Do you play high cards to the dealer to make scoring easy? Do you throw low cards out there to try and bust somebody else that was gambling on a bigger number? This is of course informed by the second thing, the cards you are working with are drafted, not dealt blind. Blackjack with that kind of information is a completely different game...and a good one.

This has all the makings of a classic, although I doubt many people have ever heard of it. Get it cheap while you can, because this just feels like one of those games that drifts into cult status and then becomes a nightmare to acquire.

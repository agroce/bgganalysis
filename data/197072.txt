My only play has been a solitaire play-through to learn the mechanics.  Strategies are still out of reach and this game is not designed for solitaire.  I will update when I play 2-player.  I see enough fun in my solitaire game that I want to make a Vassal module for it.

The theme is interesting and having a game where you are the the prosecuting or defense attorney is fascinating.  You try to understand the juror's background and prejudices and plan a legal strategy accordingly.  A wise attorney told me it's not about who has the best case, but who does the best job of convincing the jury, and in that regard, it is really cool to have an experienced attorney designing the game.

Update: no solitaire capability.  I wrote VPG about making a Vassal module, but nothing happened.  Can't really enjoy a game I am unable to play.  A shame.

A good game of statistic adjustment much like twilight struggle and 13 days.

Interesting options that make a good game of final adjustments to win victory points.

One play so rating tentative - it does a good job of taking the we the people/ Twilight struggle mechanic and putting it into a quicker and lighter playing game with a very different theme.  It does really feel like a criminal trial.  A few minor concerns regarding card variety, replayability, strategic content coexisting sufficiently with the swinginess, but it is certainly a great game to play.  Not a trial I knew of before nor was drawn to.  Like Twilight Struggle if this was Nuremberg or OJ this might be an easier sell but its still an interesting theme and well executed.  Probably like this a good deal more than 13 days although I like the longer and more complex (and lower luck)( Wir Sind Das Volk! more.  Like WSDW the last procedural stage together with the scoring can make it take a play or two to really see why you should be doing things.  The 5 rounds all different is audacious in any game but really works well without making the rule teach take too long.

There has been talk of it being biased against the prosecution, often by people with barely any plays.  I do not have enough plays with enough opponents but it seems easily in the 40-60 range of acceptability.  I have won all my games and done so with each side.  I think the prosecution need to do stuff to win  (as is thematic) but if they do (hit the proof track and get a good number of juries locked by the end of the game they have at least equal chances.  Locking a juror doubles there value which is a lot better than the defense equivalent of halfing it (basic math) - exploiting that, and picking jury members who are easy to lock combines powerfully with a high proof bonus.

Interesting hand management game with a really unique theme.  Components quality / graphic design leave a lot to be desired, but overall they function fine.  I don't know anything about the theme, but each card has text on it explaining that persons role within the history of the even, which was super neat.  This is one I would like to play again for sure, but there are some elements which can end up being frustrating (like not drawing any cards that help move your evidence up).

RATING: 4
It's a cute idea, but the maths very quickly shine through. The events and the actions can all be compared in terms of the impact on the final score. This reduces the decision space down to just do X over anything else, for mathematically it moves you closer to victory than anything else you can do with this card.

I bought this game because of the good reviews and the fact I was born & raised in Winnipeg.  I have not played the game yet but have several observations: 1) the soot on the laser cut tokens is messy (have a damp cloth or rag handy to clean up). 2) the game board is made of thin card stock that folds twice with the folds in annoying places used on the board..  A cardboard backing would be much preferable than this cheap approach. I purchased some acrylic sheets to cover it during play but I might cut the board into four and laminate it to avoid the inevitable tearing that will occur with much use. 3) There are 2 statues of Louis Riel in Winnipeg, one stately figure version on the Legislature grounds and another controversial but far more interesting version that had to be relocated due to citizen concerns (I find this version intriguing and suggest everyone have a gander at it on the web).

After 1 Play: We botched a major rule so I'll try and give my thoughts with that in mind. The flow is really interesting and I'm a sucker for multi-use card play, which this game has. A nice tug of war game spread across many tracks. Prosecution seems to be at a disadvantage due to having to prove guilt AND score 100 points, whereas the defense can just worry about keeping the tracks low. However, if the prosecution can sway a juror or two, that seems like it could be huge. 

The "what if" cards in the game seem way too powerful in my opinion, so on our 3rd game I'm going to remove them.

Nice 30-45 minute card driven tug of war game. Bought for $28, may have to sleeve the cards.

yet another very interesting and playable 2-player, dripping with theme & melodrama ... show-down and throw-down in the courtroom, as one side defends Louis against the other's Government Prosecutor ... the charge is 'high treason' against the Canadian Government (how nice for a Canadian game .. shades of PoleEconomy) .. all the witnesses are real contemporaries of Louis, and you, as lawyers, may call them to the stand to influence the jurors ... unfortunately the game loses marks for very basic presentation (the gaming board, the juror's box, the wee chits) ... but, it is a heady two player battle of wits (and just what is the defense burying for the closing summation?) ... it is difficult, and very challenging to get Louis convicted , and must be well thought out ... plays fast, is a very interesting slice of true history -- leads one into mega-books for Louis' biography and his times -- ... and also leads to wondrous game summaries ... my inner Agatha Christie tends to come out  a la Witness For The Prosecution ... 'Guilty, you honour, of malice a-fore-thought'  ..... must keep that trial caravan rolling throughout Canada for more game write-ups ..... oh yes

Unusual (and well-done) theme, unusual historical event, fast to play and easy to learn. My only criticism is that it requires a bit of table space (for a card game) and the jury tokens can be a bit fiddly.

A terrific game. Manipulating jurors. Swaying opinions. Religion and language politics in historical Canada. I just wish it had better components. I already own the game but I would jump on a second edition with better quality components.

Great game - unique, interesting, and the mechanics fit in with the theme very well.

Prosecution is a tough nut to crack, but I don't think any of the four other people I've played with felt it was imbalanced, nor did I.  I guess time will tell but for now we all just want to figure out how to win as prosecution.

A game that is worth playing and owning on theme alone. The decisions here are very interesting and the wild swings at the end of a trial seem appropriate and thematic. It's very difficult to win as the prosecution. In fact, in two tries, I haven't come that close yet. So, is it unbalanced? Tough to say. This escapes a "very good" rating from me barely due to play time (too short?) and component quality. If the board laid flat, I might give this a slight bump into the low 8's.

RATING: 6.5
Admittedly this style of game isn't my usual, so it took me longer than I expected to really grasp the rules and strategies available. But even when I felt I was floundering and constantly rereading the rule book and parsing the wording, I was completely fascinated by the historical legwork accessible with every single card. 

I wound up winning our very first game as the defense, and it felt so tight that as we were counting up points at the end I was near biting my nails with anticipation.

The board/folded paper mat wasn't exactly ideal, so we are looking into ways to make sure it survives normal wear and tear. Putting it on backing? Maybe cutting it into the four pieces and laminating it individually so it will still store in the box? 

Gifted this at BGG.Con 2016 by a friend and fellow Canadian :)

PREVIEW: Having read the rules over Christmas, this appears to be fascinating card-driven (ops vs events) game. The 'evidence' played by each side is actually just flavour text on the cards. What players are really doing is fighting over control of the jurors and appealing to ASPECTS of their natures (Protestant, catholic, francophone, farmer, civil servant, etc.) Very thematic! Looking forward to first play.

Downgraded my rating.  Nice mechanic but to me it plays out fairly quickly.  Won't be tempted by a series of such games, as some have pledged to design.  But, a quick little 2-player game.

RATING: 8
Who would have ever thought that a designer would be able to make a game that lasts less than an hour, is highly thematic, and captures some of the psychological tension of a Twilight Struggle'esque tug-of-war. In a court of law no less.

This game does it, and does it well. A real tour de force for Victory Point games.

Outstanding game and promising system. Dual use cards and the need to pick your battles carefully with incomplete information remind me of Twilight Struggle, without some of the gaminess. The downside is this sequence of events will be completely unknown to many Americans, as it was to me (though I learned a lot from playing!), and the game will be unjustly overlooked as a result. Still, super glad I bought this game. It’s intense and worth your time.

One plays as prosecutor and one the defender. Fast, easy to learn card game where you play tug of war in the court room. Felt like a lighter, faster twilight struggle. Loved reading the flavor text on the cards during gameplay. If you're a fan of historical games or court cases, this is a must. After a game, you can definitely notice how it is much harder for a prosecutor to win. Wish it was slightly more balanced. Rules are easy to follow; actions are listed on cards very specifically, player aids, game board so you shouldn't have to consult the rule book too often.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was an interesting twist on a trial using cards. I really thought the jury piece to be quite fascinating in trying to discern who should be on the jury and then focusing on pushing those trait points towards your favor and also trying to influence the jurors during the two main rounds and probably in the summation phase as well. The prosecution should likely take almost all opportunities to bump the guilty track - I won since my opponent wasn't able to get it to 2 guilt thanks to me pushing it back once.  Good thing I did so since he would have otherwise won with 105. There is some interesting tension in trying to discern what your opponents might know about the jurors based on how s/he plays their cards and what areas that person might be bumping.

The components are functional but are sub-par compared to other games of a similar price (in Europe): Pax Renaissance comes to mind, for instance. The counters with soot were particularly annoying. The thin "board" is just OK. 

Some errors/inconsistencies  are found on the cards (Louis Riel), in the rulebook (inverted arrows in the Symbology box around people. 9) or on the board (direction of arrows in Evidence of Insanity), inconsistent numbering of actions on p. 10 compared to the Attorney cards.

This is a game about the trial of Louis Riel following the rebellion he led against the state.  For the (simulated) trial, the player acting as the defense team must prevent the Crown prosecution from proving Riel's guilt.  In simple terms, if the Crown scores 100 points, Riel is found guilty.  Each side plays multi-use cards, first to discover the biases of the juror pool before the jury selection.  Then they play more cards to present their case and give final summations.  It's an interesting [b][thing=12333]"Twilight Strugglesque"[/thing][/b] game, but a game that completely flopped with my wife.  Sold.

Wow, what a hidden treasure. I had almost no expectations for this game, and the theme was something that I have no personal attachment to. But from reading the cards and the real courtroom struggle I felt for Riel as he sat in that chair with his life in the hands of jurors and the prejudices. Excellent little game that plays in less than an hour and comes highly recommended from me.

My wife and I play tested the Beta version of this game.  I would rate it easy to learn and quick to play.  At the same time it is challenging.  You can chose to focus on a number of different strategies or a combination of strategies.  It pays to keep the opponent guessing as to what you are really trying to influence. Initial play tests have favoured the defence but we are learning quickly and I think future games should result in some games ending in a conviction and others in an acquittal. The way the game is designed encourages you to use advanced planning, bluffing, and a little bit of number crunching.  One well timed move can produce a cascade of effects that can result in the trial moving towards a very different outcome.  Lots of fun and highly re-playable.

Quite a surprise, and not of the unpleasant kind! Someone compared this to Twillight Struggle? I concur. It feels similar, in a way, more condensed, though, and much shorter, that is. And with a very unusual idea for a theme/setting.  I'm not so sure about its depth, but I felt entertained and challenged throughout the play. The announced 40 minutes for a play seem realistic to me.

Excellent game from VPG and I hope the first of many in this new series ...also I found the subject of this game, which was little known to me, fascinating too...

I minused 1 point because the board had been folded 4 times to fit in the box and I think puzzle pieces would have been a lot better ...but that just my personal preference ...I love VPGs and glad I can purchase them from my on line store and not have to buy direct ...as the import tax is outrageous ...

Good Card Driven Game, has similarities to Twilight Struggle, If you want a good CDG that is shorter I would pick this one, next would be forged in steel
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a card-driven game where the two players represent the prosecution and defence in a trial and it feels very thematic. The jurors each start out with hidden traits, and in the jury selection phase you get to peek at or reveal some of these and then decide which jurors to excuse because they are unlikely to be predisposed to your side. 

The main part of the trial then involves taking turns playing cards for either their event or for action points, which are used to influence jurors directly or to move various tracks corresponding to their traits (e.g. Protestant or Catholic, English or French). You also stash a handful of (hopefully strong) cards for the summation phase when final arguments are presented. In the closing deliberation phase, jurors you've already persuaded to your side can influence others, and then the final score is totalled up depending on the jurors' traits and positions of the corresponding tracks. 

It's surprisingly simple and fast-playing once you get going. I think we were done in not much more than 45 minutes and hardly had to refer back to the rulebook at all. I stockpiled events for the summation phase that allowed me to present strong evidence of insanity, but when we totalled up the juror scores, Matt had achieved 103, when 100+ is required for prosecution. And by such a slender margin, Louis Riel was hanged!

Victory Point Games are soliciting designs for other famous trials using the same system and I can really see that working well. Scopes Monkey Trial please!

Like a shorter Twilight Struggle with it's own nuances, strange that the prosecution has such a hard fight with how history went. The idea of fighting over individual jurors while managing the overall all effects things like their religion and occupation might affect their final opinion is excellent.  Each round the cards you don t used get banked for the final summation phase so there's a long-term drafting going on as well.

This is such a great idea for a game! This little game packs a tug-of-war battle between the defense and prosecution in the trial, all in the span of 45-60 minutes. This is a card-driven wargame in a trial setting, it's brilliant! Instead of fighting over places on a map, each side fights over influencing "aspects" of the trial and jurors.

The game has the quality of your typical VPG Gold Banner game: crimson pizza box with sleeve,  thick & sooty laser-cut tokens, unmounted (but solid) map, nice cards. For $26, it's not a bad deal. It's a meaty game for the size and price.

The cards are wonderfully clever. There is a box for each round of play (jury selection, Trial-in-chief, and Summation) with differing events available in each OR action points to spend in place of events, similar to Events/Ops in Twilight Struggle.

VPG has said they hope to use this game system to bring other trials to game form, I hope to see much from this line of games.

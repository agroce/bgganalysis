Football Strategy with team stats to add greater variety and interest.  Played many times in the early eighties, not at all since. Recently bought a second set at auction because I NEEDED the 1985 team sheets.

RATING: 7.2
Each player selects a play and rolls their offensive/defensive dice.  The offensive player cross-references his rolled number against a chart to obtain a result.  

The defensive player does the same, comparing his defensive scheme against the offensive play, which modifies the offensive player's result.

Could buy teams yearly, but I only had the original.  Pittsburgh was as horrible in 1978 as it was in 1971.

Played this a lot and used then-current rosters to keep stats.

DATA-DRIVEN FOOTBALL (Rating: 10)
----------------------------
Certainly the best team-based football game around— especially the easy-playing computer version. Designer (and statistician?) Ron Pisarz, Jr. has performed an amazing feat, turning trash into an accurate, playable and fun simulation. Despite the original design's basic selection of offensive and defensive plays, DDF feels more like real football than anything I've ever played, and the results are incredibly realistic in game play, outcomes and statistics. The amount of work Ron puts into this game-- he views, compiles and analyzes every play of every game, for example-- is mind-boggling (and I've personally seen some of his data and spreadsheets)! I can't imagine a more accurate simulation of pro football. Every fan on Earth should play this game! Go to www.datadrivenfootball.com and try the demo now!

PAYDIRT (Rating: 1)
----------
Ugh. The original game—replete with highly unrealistic ratings and results. A simple example from the 1983 season posted here on BGG:

In 1983, the 14-2 Redskins defense gave up only 9 rushing TDs and 3.7 yards per run. The 2-14 Oilers yielded 23 TDS and a horrendous 4.8 yards per run.  Yet, according to the game’s Priority Chart, the defensive result in parentheses trumps almost all offensive results—which means that the Redskins' run defense is impotent when an opponent needs one yard for a first down or TD—and will practically ALWAYS fail. (Offense #1, Defense B.) Meanwhile, the Oilers' crappy run defense will stop 36% for no gain! This cannot possibly mirror reality—and borders on the absurd!

I played a partial season of this game with my dad when I was younger. My mom let me take custody of the game and I found the season record sheet we kept when I opened it up (which is how I know exactly how many times I played it.) From what I remember the game was pretty fun and I will always keep it on my shelf thanks to the fun memories of playing all those games of it with my dad.

Back in the day, this game was IT, and I played the hell out of it!  As a budding boardgamegeek, I played an entire 16-game 1980 season with the help of a few friends and a self-designed solitaire defense selector.

Box has two split corners on right side of lid and top side has a one inch tear up to cover...shows obvious shelf wear.  Rules, all teams, board, scoreboard, and dice are all complete and in good shape.  The team cards are pretty thin, so you can tell they've been handled, but they are not damaged.  I own the college version of this game, so would be willing to trade away the pro version for the right trade offer.  Traded away to BGG user for Die Macher.

A nice little game.  I'm glad it's part of my collection.  Originally introduced to the game in 1972 (I remember it as a product attached to the SPORTS ILLUSTRATED outfit), but I was probably too young at the time to really grasp the gist of it.  I DO recall it seemed quite realistic and seemed to be a game I would play more and more (a friend from school actually owned the game), but never had a third or fourth chance to pick up the flow of the thing.  All of the NFL teams are rated for performance on offense, defense, and special teams, of course, and the game has always been highly rated for realism and ease of play by table gamers and so-called "experts" alike.  It regularly draws a lot of interest on internet auction sites, too.  Some participants turn over a lot of cash to win a valuable  item like PAYDIRT.

Best football game I've played so far, but sometimes feels too "gamey" in that it is too easy to end up "playing to the chart" as opposed to playing more realistically.  I'm a huge football fan, so I'm still looking for the perfect gridiron game.

Still, it's a very good game, and my rating may go up after more plays.

This classic football game has been a favorite of mine since I was 11 or 12 and is always a hit with newbies and veterans alike. My friends and I play this by the historical schedule for the entire season as a campaign game. It took a few years but we finished the 1978 season, and are half way through the 1979 Season right now. Can't beat these old charts done by Dr. Nicely.

Simple, perhaps, but great fun. Have 1983 "Radiers" year (last Dr Nicely) and 1984 year (post Dr Nicely), as well as one of the 2008 year releases. Really love the '83 version, but the '84 struggles a bit, possibly due to duplication of chart data.  A Paydirt league is fantastic.

When I was a kid, this game was essentially my transition from generic "all teams are equal" type games like 3M Football to the greatness that is Statis Pro Football. Having each individual team modeled was pretty cool, but not nearly as cool as having each individual *player* modeled. Also, once I lost the red or the green die (I forget which), the game became pretty much unplayable. I think I bought Bowl Bound just so I could use the dice for Paydirt again.

A classic. Sports Illustrated and mathematics guru Thomas R. Nicely devised the mechanics of this game, which uses realistic team charts.

A very satisfying 2-player sports game in which each player fields an opposing NFL team in a football game. Each turn players secretly select a play depending on whether their team is currently on Offense or Defense.  The outcome is then confirmed by dice rolls and reference to charts.  Each team is rated for its strengths and weaknesses and I find that the end game results are believable. Better teams will usually beat lesser teams however there is scope for a more experienced player to influence the results, as well as just the right amount of randomized luck to ensure you get some 'Oh wow!' moments.  Very enjoyable.  Even better with Ron Pisarz Jr's 'Data Driven Football' stats.

Does a mostly credible job in fulfilling its design intent (kicking game excepted). The better team almost always wins (as in life) because it is a statistical game.

Game was in a backpack that was stolen from the underbay of a Greyhound bus. 
It included: 1969, 1970, 1972, 1981, 1983 and 1987 season charts.
All gone :/

Traded for the 1978 Season--one of the best Steelers teams ever! Played this some in my teens, but not nearly as much as Strat-o-matic... SOM is the better, more detailed game, but Paydirt plays much faster...

First game in a long time (2 June 11)... SD over Philly 29-6... this forced me to order the computer version, which doesn't offer the same tension as head-to-head play, but is still a lot of fun

I have an Avalon Hill Paydirt box, but sold the charts that came in it (1979).  The charts I have were published by Sports Illustrated, and they are for the 1969 and 1970 seasons.

RATING: 8.5
A fine NFL simulation, using team charts, rather than individual players. Excellent for solitaire play, as playcalling charts are easy to design.

I bought the box game back in 1987 and picked up expansion seasons until 1990; but eventually kicked the habit due to lack of interest in my gaming group of the time. Honestly, over 20 years later, there isn't much call to break out the game now.

Sports Illustrated Pro Footbal- prior to name change to Paydirt. Has 1971 teams. Everything's there, including solo play instructions from magazine. Box is in poor shape really shows its age.

A cool football sim boardgame that got me interested in NFL football. I believe this is the first AH game I ever owned. It was a Christmas gift.

Another oddity for a Brit like me - but I really like this one and it plays really well.  Even though I only have one season's teams, there is huge variety.  A stat-based sports sim that flows well.

A very fun to play simulation of each team from a given season.  You really feel like you're coaching the team.  Fairly simple to learn and really fun to go head-to-head, especially challenging if you have a weaker team.  Would love to play in a league!

RATING: 4
Badly flawed design. Has a strange rule to try and balance the teams, which often results in sides scoring alternately as they get worse when they get ahead.

An Avalon Hill game that I actually had time to understand and play. A superb rendition of US Football. Play as any of the teams, the handicap-system evens things up for the weaker ones. Dice driven and far more involved than the lighter but still great 1st & Goal.

What can I say - one of my all time favorite sports game. The College version (Bowlbound) is terrific, too. Easy to play, great feel.

My version is called Sports Illustrated Football. A good NFL football head-to-head strategy game for those interested in playing with old historical teams.

This game was a lot of fun - we even drafted our own teams and created our own team charts.  I'd like to see this one reprinted.

One of the games that takes me back to high school.  I still play it, and have set up a number of leagues with team charts ranging from 1977 to 2004.  Great fun, intense game!  The playoffs, for the League that I run, can become somewhat heated.  The Super Bowl last year, NY Jets, vs. San Diego was so intense that for the 4th quarter the "fans" were asked to not speak at all during it.  It was tied up in the last minute, then the Jets ended up running the KO return back for an 89-yard TD!  The Jets were favored, and most everyone was rooting for the underdog Chargers...  It was a great game...just one of hundreds.  Love it.

After playing in my fourth season in a row, over four years, some of the luster of this game is going away.  Why?  I have called games where my defense was "right" for the offensive play called 90% of the game, and only 10-15% of the time, did I have any impact on the play.  This grows tiresome.  

I want a football game that has more strategy, more "play" more "real" decision making, and by making the "right call" I want "right results".

I just dropped my rating from a 9 to an 8.

This game is perfect for me.  I love football, and I really love it when simulated in a board game.  This isn't going to be for everybody, particularly people who dislike sports, but this is one of the best in the genre of simulation games that use the mechanic of cross-referencing two guesses and looking up the result on a chart.  This is clearly the best football strategy sim I've played, and I've played upwards of 15.  The decisions are fresh with every new matchup, even if you only have one season.  This game perfectly balances playability with depth, so it's not as deep as some other football sims, notably [gameid=5740], but it is more intuitive and faster.  The mechanics behind it use common sense and football rules to make the game flow very cleanly.  The description included on every team is also good to allow a quick high-level assessment of a team's strengths, which is invaluable for a new player.  The defensive play-calling is satisfying, with a correct defensive call likely to shut down the offense.  Great replayability.  I've even played a full 16-game season of this with a friend.  Great game in all regards.

Played probably 300 games with this thing.  1977 version is year.  My Dad & I played most of the games.  The rest were solo.  3-4 full seasons and a couple of double elimination tournament style brackets (random draw for order) for fun.  Lost to my dad once 2-0 (the lowest score you can win by in football).  Kept stats, record book on interesting games.

When I was a kid, I used to play this game solitaire and simulate entire seasons for my favorite teams. Even though it's extremely abstracted, it always manages to produce very realistic results. Very cool simulation game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decent and fun game, but it takes a bit too long to play for the type of simulation of football it represents. It does a great job of capturing the spirit of each team and therefore does a good job of providing an insite into these teams from a historical perspective.

My favorite football game in either Pro or College form.  Only problems are that their assumptions changed from set to set, so you can't play them against each other, and in only a few years did they get the field goal performance fairly realistic.

I have a copy from the 70s, totally untouched besides some split corners. Worth figuring out after all this time?

I don´t lie if I say that it´s one of my favourite games. I´ve not played to other Risks yet, but I know that there´s no one like this one, and it is so complete that I don´t hesitate to say it´s one of the best boardgames to start playing games. It´s sad for me to see it so low on the rating... But well, its name is Risk.

Barely could be called Risk, and that's a complement.  Soooo much better than regular Risk as to not even look like the same type of game.  It's area control that much in common, but card/action driven layer that really makes this game shine (not set driven like regular risk).

Risk Europe is awesome. It is hardly Risk. Risk is in the title because it's a Hasbro product.

There is territory control like Risk, but you earn your income through the number of cities and contiguous territories you control, not through controlling all territories within a region.

I don't usually rate a game after 1 play but this game surprised me.  I was expecting Risk... great! But the level of table talk and negotiating totally shocked me. The game keeps everything simple mechanically but creates really tough decisions. Combat system is great and simple... take note Fantasy Flight Games.

Nice medieval strategy game.  Combat is more like Axis and Allies than Risk.  My brother works for Hasbro and I don't know why they have to name every one of their games Monopoly, Clue or Risk.  There is very little in common with Risk in this game.  There is more strategy and less downtime by far.  With the exception of slightly thin cards, the components are pretty nice for the price.  This game is a big surprise.

Impressive board and miniatures, epic in feel, balanced and fairly tactical rules.  

Limited taxing and spending options mean troop build ups get pretty big before major battles take place. Battles are rarer and more meaningful than in basic traditional risk, of which this is a major step away from and an excellent improvement. Castles, archers, cavalry and siege engines add plenty of tactical advantages.

Good further development of Risk, which shares only some minor mechanics.
Individuell City powers, truly different unit types, VP race win condition, actionmanagment, ends in an good tactical 90-120 min wargame.

I prefer games without luck, but this Risk has system similar to the Axis&Allies one in which eventually luck plays a very marginal rule in my point of view. But differently than A&A here there are very different possible moves. The game is really cool and also the pieces. It is not the classical Risk for sure, some thing very different.

Other than sharing the name, RISK there is not many similarities with the predecessors. This is a great "dudes on a map" style game, easy to teach and plays in about 2 hours. Combat rank system works very well and each turn left with many decisions to make. I found this game to be more fun than some of the newer "hyped" titles released recently.

Pros : 
Adds several new concepts to the Risk franchise - it's not just another variation of the same original game
Varied & decent quality miniatures
Hasbro went to the effort of making a rules walkthrough on YouTube (though the guy that presents is a total creep with an annoying posh accent...)

Cons : high dependancy on dice rolls but not as bad as it is within other Risk's including the original

Suggested Max Worth : £30

July 2016 - discovered this game from BGG thread. Risk name is mostly for marketing purposes as the game is more like Axis & Allies with different units having different costs and abilities. Looks very cool and will rate upon play.

January 2017 - after three plays, I've decided this is a great game, easily the best "Risk" title ever published. Essentially a card-driven wargame, it's tense every turn as you can never do everything you want to do and you have to plan your orders in advance.

Can a perfect game like Risk be improved? Yes! Horrified by all those merchandising versions (Star Wars Risk?? Bitch, please!!), this one took the classic conquering experience to another level, geting closer to real conquest wars, adapting the different kind of troops role very well: Infantry, cavalry and siege machinery work in a very close to middle age wars way.
Also, the map works representing faithfully Middle age Europe's dinamics, with key territories and menacing mercenaries only loyal to the highest bidder.
The game dinamics are more complex than the original Risk, and the game less agile. This could discourage some players, used to fast skirmish games. Again, this one is closer to real middle age warfare, with long term goals mainly, although gold can turn a whole continent destiny in a moment...
A match can last for hours and hours... but that can be considered good or bad depending on the contenders.

Compared to regular Risk, this game is fantastic. It is only Risk in name only. The game borrows gameplay mechanics from other wargames and introduces some new ideas that are refreshing. A very fun lite wargame that is easy to pick up and play, but also has an unexpected elegant layer of strategy to it.

RATING: N/A
Looks like a nice update of Risk for the mass market.  Here I like the way they made some changes to the basic engine and maintained the simplicity, rather than taking the route of pervious Risk versions that heaped some new themes and mechanisms on top of the creaky original risk.  However, I see nothing here that makes it seem superior to my current go-to Risk-alikes Conquest of Nerath and Nexus Ops.

Components are all pretty nice, especially for the price - £16 new from eBay! Good map, clear iconography, decent little miniatures.

The ruleset seems clear and uncluttered but with enough depth to keep everyone well occupied. Table talk and diplomacy should be able to come to the fore, as the rules are simple enough to stay out of everyone's way so they can get on with the game.

The version I have is called "Risk: The Game of Strategic Conquest." Boardgamegeek for whatever reason doesn't list the exact version that I own. It was developed in 2015 as was the Risk: Europe version.

Take over the world in this exciting game of military strategy, now with a refreshed look that includes updated figures, compelling board art, and improved Mission cards. In the Risk game players set out to conquer their enemies' territories by building an army, moving in troops, and engaging in battle.

4 Ways to Play. The Risk game guide lays out 4 different ways to play: Secret Mission, Classic, Risk for 2 Players, and Capital. When playing the Secret Mission variation, players race to complete the secret mission noted on the Secret Mission cards. For Classic Risk, players must conquer every territory on the board. Risk for 2 Players adds a neutral army to the mix, and Capital Risk is a shorter variation of the classic game. No matter which variation you play, remember. ..when it comes to taking over the world, it's all about who is willing to take the biggest Risk.

This gives me a similar nostalgic Risk game feel without the 4 to 6 hour timeframe to play it in.  It also has some fun strategic changes with command cards and 4 different types of troops.  Usually plays in an hour and I have yet to see someone get eliminated from game play before the game was finished.  They did a great job of fixing many of the frustrating parts of the original Risk game.

Uses Risk as the base mechanics with added battle unit special abilities.  Variety and quantity of components is very generous for the price.  Simple action system with order cards serves as a good introduction to more complicated war games.  I like the idea of the Mercenaries (proxy 3rd & 4th player), but they seem to be overpowered in a 2-player game.

This is what happens when a RISK game and a Eurogame have on offspring. I like the bidding and the mercenary rules. But the siege machines seem to powerful and the map seems to small. And I don't like the buying of crowns. Not a bad game at all but there are a bunch of games I prefer over this.

Not really "Risk", as it offers a lot more depth and thought involvement in this game!  The different units really have a significant impact, as do the Castles, the different abilities for certain locations, and the variety of abilities that can be gained by the missions.  When playing 3 players, the Mercenary Army is a significant factor!

Really into this one! It's perfect for what it is: a light-weight wargame with tactical elements. I find this kind of an area control game the best because it's easy to introduce to casual players yet has that strategical element to keep it interesting for more experienced gamers. My only complaint is that there is no expansion to add more Mission or Kings Orders cards to the game. The decision pool is currently quite small.

I was actually really surprised! This is the ultimate DOAM dice chucker with amazing minis, some exploration elements, interesting choices and variable incentives for capturing cities...uh, game.

The dice combat is comparative, I think, to Axis and Allies (as I've never played Nexus Ops) along with the old-fashioned Risk method as well. I very much dig this. 

My main issue with regular Risk was the constant movement across the maps after successful attacks. That's mitigated here with a card-driven mechanic that, while not new, elevates this Risk variant above its brethren. There are only a few overall decisions, and some may or may not come at opportune moments, but they require some forethought instead of just issuing a simple 'attack and dominate' order. It also creates a little FOW and "miscommunication" amongst your faction; fitting for the theme. There is less emphasis on outright attacking in this game than you would think, but that's a good thing. This leaves you to focus on capturing land away from your opponents and gather cities/crowns (points) for money and potential castles and recruitments to build up your army later on. 

Oh and did I mention that this only takes an hour to play?!

Turtling can still be an issue, especially if your opponent is in a castle and you're without a siege weapon. If you are okay with this, than you have found the definitive Risk experience in my book. Europe is better than all the other versions...and yes, that includes Risk Legacy.

This game should almost not have the "Risk" title attached to it. Other than rolling dice to resolve combat, there are not many similarities with this game and traditional Risk. That being said, after 2-3 plays of this game (with 4 players, I would only recommend playing with exactly 4), I really enjoy Risk Europe. This is a strategy game, not a pure roll and attack dice-fest. Much deeper and intriguing game of manipulation and subtle strategy. I really like it!

Rating based on 4 players.

Tentative rating, as our game was cut short. If you're looking for a "real" wargame, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a light combat game that is completely ahistorical with a little bit of cardplay, a little bit of economy, and lots of dice rolls, this is a nice one. Unlike regular Risk, the endgame condition is definitely doable within a reasonable amount of time, and the card-based orders make turns go fairly quickly. The production is quite nice too, with a big map and individual sculpts for the different armies (thought the footmen and archers could be a little more differentiated).

Totally rescues the entire concept of Risk for me - it's what I always thought Risk should have been. 

Love the variation in unit types and abilities. Love the simultaneous action selection. Love that the turns are short. Love that the battles only happen at the end of the round so that play isn't constantly interrupted. Love that the game doesn't begin with the map entirely filled in. Love that you can buy things with coins. Love that the game is won without having to take over the entire map. Love fighting over the city bonus abilities. Love the more intimate focus on Europe than the entire world. Love that the game doesn't snowball in favour of the leader. Love the miniatures variation between each army.

This thing takes the best of Risk and transforms it into a new game! I still haven't tried mission cards variant, but I'm looking forward to it.

EDIT: I already tried 4 player game with missions and I must say that it really improves the game. The mission objectives are feasible and the bonus are great yet not overpowered. The only grief I find is that there are only 8 mission cards. It would be much better if it came with a pool of 15-20 cards and they made you take 8 mission cards at random at the beginning of the game...

It's far from a flawless game, but just finding somthing so much better then the original RISK makes me happy. All players need to know how to play this game, otherwise this could be a very quick experience. Just expand fast enough over a couple of rounds and you've won. Everyone needs to be able to identify these potential situations and take counter actions. If so, this becomes a really nice game. In other words this is not the kids game that the original RISK is. And the battles are much better. Still just dice rolling, but it does matter how you build up your armies with different troops and strengths.

Far better than any generic version of Risk that I have yet played, this 2-4 player wargame still suffers from several major faults.

First, this game (like every other version of Risk ever made) suffers from something of a runaway leader problem, especially if someone is able to capture and hold the three Western cities on the map (like Australia in other versions of Risk).

Second, this game doesn't scale well for fewer than 4 players, forcing you to add 1 or 2 "mercenary factions" to the game, control of which must be bid on each round.

Finally, the game is still hamstrung by the silly "attacker rolls 3 dice, defender rolls 2" combat system of Risk, although there are several mitigating factors to this (such as different unit types that attack in sequence and must hit or exceed a certain number).

All things considered, not a bad game by any means (especially for a game bearing the "Risk" title), but certainly not a standout title in the wargame genre either.

For the aforementioned reasons, this game has been sold.

If you like Risk, but hate rolling dice for 3 hours, this game is for you.

The core of the game is Risk, but there is far more strategy and far less battles determined by the luck of the dice.  I really enjoyed how the game limits what you can do in a round.  No one can storm across the board collecting cards and demolishing everyone.

I've played several versions of Risk and this one is by far my favorite.

I grew up loving Risk, but it is ultimately a dice fest of slow momentum.  Europe is perfect in the sense that you have some variable player bonuses depending on what area you control and the 4 types of troops that resolve in waves (Siege Engines, then Archers, then Cavalry, then regular troops).  Makes it a bit more interesting.  Ironically, I got this for non gamers who like DOAM games like Risk to show them some of what new game mechanics can do.  Nice production as well with good solid minis, nice linen finish board and box.

This game is superior to risk and is similar in depth to Axis & Allies, Fortress America, Ikusa, etc.  All of the rules come into play in almost every game and a good player must master all of them.  I only played 13 two player games and lost every one of them to the same tough opponent, although many of those games were still very close and all of them were exciting.  I'd still play a two player game again, despite my losing streak.  The 2 player game has a lot of see-saw situations, where you can be winning one moment and losing the next.  There is a lot of card and dice luck involved.  If you are like my opponent, an impulsive lucky casino player type (good at cards, dice, and betting), this game is for you.  If you are like me, the wargame grognard strategic planning type, you'll have a tough but fun time with this game too.  This game, especially the battle sequences, give you the feeling like you're Ragnard Lothbrok (from Vikings TV series), Sir Wallace (Braveheart Movie), etc.  Excellent castle & catapult theme in the game.  Excellent beer and pretzel game that will last 1-3 hours every time you play it.  I would like to see a future version with Viking Style ships involved (no naval combat in this game).

Risk: Europe -- This game finally gets the whole Risk concept "right" for an immersive introductory DOAM board gaming experience.  Risk: Europe sits well-prepared and well-positioned to serve as the primary entry point for DOAM games.  I see this game making it an easy progression to advance this style of boardgame through the following stages:

1. Risk: Europe
2. Gamemaster Series games  (Ikusa, Conquest of the Empire etc.)
3. Advanced DOAM games  (Mare Nostrum, Fire and Axe, Diplomacy etc.)

It's not a heavy game like Eclipse or Forbidden Stars, but it scratches a similar itch and can be taught and played much quicker. Don't let the name fool you!

Very fun game I am glad I bought this.  I have tried other Risk games and this is the best by far.  Played 2 player using the Empires variant (see files section.)  This is a great 2 player variant.  Just not sure yet if playing to 7 crowns is the right amount, we're still experimenting.  We didn't even try the 2 player rules in the rule book.  Sounded too convoluted and we don't like auctions.

Over all excellent game and highly recommended.

Love the battle mechanics and the depth of strategy they bring instead of just plain die rolling like Classic RISK. 2 Player & 3 Player games can be over with little to no combat due to strategic use of mercenaries and city selection in the early game. Overall enjoyed it and would suggest it to others.

:thumbsup: Adds meat to the bones of Risk: action selection, different combat units, different combat phases, reinforceable territories, victory conditions that ensure shorter and interesting gameplay.
:thumbsup: More strategic thinking involved, while still accessible to a mass market audience.

:thumbsdown: The fluorescent plastic of the miniatures is a really odd choice in an otherwise beautifully produced game.

At the end of the day it's still risk! Whether it has funky miniatures and different units, it is still at heart risk. Yes it plays faster, yes there's what you could call a game economy, but it's still risk and woeful with two players. So it leaves the collection.

Mixed feelings.  Compared to Risk, it's exceptionally good.  The combat system is straightforward but clever, requiring strategy.  Combat is resolved much faster than in the base game, and yet in much more interesting fashion.  The strategy choices of tax, spend, expand, maneuver are all interesting.  Down side: it's still LONG.  LOOOOONG.  And with fewer than 4 players, although the "mercenary" army system is solid and creates still more strategic decisions and opportunities, the constant bidding for control of them gets a bit tedious.

I can confirm that it plays as well, if not better as a 3 player. The auction for the mercenary 4th army each round is just superb.

Actually very good.  Gameplay is fast with good decisions.  The components and even the insert are of good quality.  The mercenary army is quite fun when not playing full compliment of players.

We used the mission variant and it does make the game longer but i do feel it is more interesting than just buying crowns.  Our first 3 player game with the mission variant was 3 hours.

Don't be prejudice against the name; this isn't Risk, it's a well paced light war game involving significant strategy.

Only some very minor complaints:
1) Footmen & archers can be hard to discern when clustered together
2) Armies can easily grow larger than many of the provinces, which plays into issue 1).
3) The box inner doesn't really provide enough space for all the components; especially once you've bagged the individual unit types (necessary to mitigate the problem caused by 1)

The merc rules (used for 2 & 3 player games) are quite good too; actually adding to the strategy of the game, rather than the afterthought they tend to be in other games.

Best with 4, good with 3, not played with 2.
Highly recommend.

Honestly Risk Europe does not have much in common with the regular Risk that I have grown sick of. Risk Europe is much easier to get into and just has a more fluent and natural-feeling game flow. Different units still heavily depend on luck with dice-rolling, but make the entire game much more strategic. We love it.

Just bought it...wife does not know another game slipped in...muhahahaha!   I haven't played it but will rate it ASAP....

Played it.  Incorrectly.  Got it fixed.  Lots of chaos.  Lots of planning:  which trumps which one?  I dunno but I get a lot of choices and the choices matter.  More akin to Ikusa than Risk, believe it or not...fine game...

Let me tell you this way:  it is damn good DOAM.  Now, it has Risk stamped on it and since it is GREAT it won't sell very well and MB won't properly promote it.  Mark my words...you should but two copies or will be sad.  I got one and will buy a reserve before it goes the way of the dodo.  I could be wrong too...Risk 2210 can still be had reasonably.  MAYBE this will also hang around.  I don't want to chance it.  RISK is synonymous with mass market but this honestly is a gamer's game.  I hope
But doubt that the masses will adopt it and that will be a shame!

Two copies!!  Warpiglet had spoken....

Nice and fun but likely too long. Played in 4th, I reached 7 crowns but by the end of the turn, i was back to 6.
We ended the game with 5 crowns each and too exhausted to end.
The big problem is, of course, a continuous bash the leader effect.
The mechanic itself is very nice and provides a lot of fun and excitement.
I guess a possible solution, with 4 players, would be to have more crown cards in order to inevitably go toward the end.

I'll play it again gladly

I don't know if my rating is charitable or miserly, but there's a good chance that Risk Europe is fundamentally screwed up.

The most effective option seems to be for all players to avoid each other for as long as possible to solidify their money/VP base - a very anti-Risk philosophy - and then purchase additional VPs for 10 gold apiece.  Except that, based on income level and special powers, one particular board position appears to be superior to the others.

If the "best position" player is left alone, they tend to win quickly after having as few as 1-2 battles. If an immediate neighbor is pressured into attacking the would-be winner early on ("Do your duty!"), then they break each other's spines and throw the game to one of the remaining two opponents.

I wonder if the game could be improved by randomizing the income levels and special powers associated with each city, rather than having them permanently affixed.  That might prevent cheap wins that are knocked out in 15-45 minutes, or it might just make things worse.

I'm glad I played, but I'm also glad not to play again.

Part Ameritrash (dudes on a map roll dice), part Euro (card-driven actions, variable city bonuses). Production values are gorgeous - large hard mounted board, 4 beautifully sculpted armies (Vikings, Russians, French, and Saracens). Rules are easy to grasp. My second favorite Medieval war game now, after Warriors of God.

I got the game because it has nice miniatures and a medieval theme. It plays smooth even with new players. We played three new players, and we left it after 2 hours, it is a long game. I loved that, in a four player game, you have a mercenary army so you can bid the control of the army. However, the game works definitely with 4; it is too fiddly to shift the mercenary army all the time. I thought it would be a hit with new players, but at the end, it was not so exciting. As always with area control games, the map is too big to create an early confrontation. For instances, one player took Spain, other Berlin and the other Rome. Spain rapidly conquered Paris, Algeria and then Dublin, he collected a bunch of taxes and could buy a crown and a huge threatening army.  I mean he was kind of isolated.

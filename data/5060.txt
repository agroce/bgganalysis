Great game, low unit density, very manageable due to leader activation system. Lots of options for strategy. A bit rules-heavy, but worth the investment. The map has to be one of the most beautiful game maps of all time. I framed mine! This game is probably not a good introduction to the GBOH series as it is more complex than the other games in the series. The actual combat and naval rules are a bit simpler than those in GBoH and War Galley, respectively, but the fact that you're asked to manage both in one game is asking quite a bit.

I am familiar with GBoH and have been a fan of it since it first came out.  I am amazed at how quickly and smoothly this game plays, especially since it has to accomodate naval combat, small unit actions and street fighting within a system that was designed for big set-piece battles.  The situation is excellent, both sides have the distinct impression that the challenges they face are greater than the advantages they have.  One particular game I played (full scenario) easily qualified as one of my toughest and most satifying games ever.  

Not certain why I don't rate it higher.  It could be because unless your opponent is already familiar with the game it may take a commitment to more than one playing to get the real experience.

Another good game from GMT's Great Battles Of History (GBoH).  For the most part, the rules are pretty much the same for all GBoH games.  Of course each game has its own special rules and goals.  In my opinion the only negative thing about this game is the battles in confined spaces.  That's the reason for just the '6' rating.  I prefer large battles in open fields compared to city fighting, which this game is mainly about. There is also sea battles around the city of Alexanderia.  But, if anyone likes the GBoH series, and don't mind city battles, I would suggest this game.

Fast playing and beautiful game on a somewhat obscure subject. Egyptians barely have a prayer and the naval battle has no bearing on the land battle. Not a classic, but worth a play if you love ancient warfare or the GBOH series.

A game in GMT's "Great Battles of History" series, this one covers the fight for the city of Alexandria at the time of Caesar's "visit" to the city. The first game in the series to portray city/street fighting.

Vol. 9 in the GMT's Great Battles of Histroy series.  It is a great game just from the production point.  One standard 22"x34" map with 280 colorful counters depicting Roman legions and Egyptian army.  The topic is inter-mixed with the love affair between Antony (not featured in the game), Julius Ceasar and Cleopatra (We have her here, but she has no effect on play, just merely decorative. She has no "heroic charisma" as Julius Ceasar does.)  Even more so interesting.  The game is very unique in portraying a land-sea operation by both sides.  Special terrain features e.g. city block, street fighting, palace, canal, beach, lighthouse (!), gate, redoubt, causeway.....cannot be found common in other games.  This makes the simulation especially interesting...well, a lot more DRMs (Die-roll modifiers).  The rules are adapted from both previous simple GBoH games and War Galley on the sea battles. Many rules have been simplified to accomodate the battle situation.  But the interaction among different military units still makes it a comparatively complex game than others.  But the effects are fun and exciting.  Turn seizure by either side with the overall commander's seizure rating (Ceasar has a rating of 6!) gives the game a chess-like movement and fight.  Other game concepts like Cohesion, Troop Quality, Leader initiatives, Missle Fire, Galley combat etc. have been very familiar to the fans of the series already.  The game should be a blast to play.

Picked up at Ducosim auction, 2013.  Looks like an interesting scenario: I knew nothing of the history, so it will be interesting to learn.

To my mind, good games present the player with multiple ways of achieving victory. This game seems to present the player with multiple ways of achieving a loss! Thus both sides need to stay on top of the situation across the map and constantly way up the possibilities.
The combination of naval and land action adds an interesting dynamic to play that is rare in any genre and uncommon in gaming as a whole.

Well worth the effort, even for those not into the GBOH series, if for no other reason than there is a counter for Cleopatra.

At first: An hybrid WarGalley / Gboh / Urban ! Cool!

Too many same/not the same rules for various spaces (hex, points, block) .

The map comes quickly unmanageable around the Palace with too many units at the same place with not enough physical space.

The WarGalley thing just distract from the street batlles. Not sure if it worth the pain to try to get the objectives hex, or just do the attrition game.

I have playtested this one and I've got mixed feelings about it. The situation is really nice, the game plays quite fast and the battle flows nicely, but a lot of the game is streetfighting between big numbers of troops which translates in a lot of diceload to slowly grind down the brittle egyptian troops... all in all, a game which is fun, but which left me with the impression that it could have been more fun...

Very tempted to acquire this game, but having heard so little about it, I feel it is a risky buy.  The Legionaries arms and armour depicted on the counters look correct for the period at least, something you don't often see.

Usually I really like GBOH and SGBOH, but this sort of game didn't do it for me: a hybrid of Gboh and Sgboh, with some simple naval rules ala War Galley chucked on, and then a city point map added...the whole thing is an elaborate contraption...too much so, just to play out this one battle, and to find out the game is playing you to a large extent.  Inspired, professional, but in the end, not worth it.

RATING: 6
GBOH game with ancient street fighting, which is unusual. The Roman legionaries have the advantage in the streets, but not in the blocks where the Egyptians could stack high with Heavy Infantry for defence and Light Infantry, which just chucked javelins at the Romans until they died from excessive perforation. I could not figure a way of stopping this, so I sold it off.

By popular demand, my two cents:

Caesar has beautiful components and a lot of potential, but sadly the potential is squandered. The rulebook is a mess, with many important terms left undefined (including unit types), numbered rules missing, and ambiguities aplenty. Some counters seem to be missing from the countersheet too (turn marker, exhaustion level for both armies, you know, the bare basics of a wargame). This is not a huge problem, but it certainly doesn't bode well -- it's not up to GMT's usual high standard. You can bring your own, but for $70 you shouldn't have to.

The underlying system is basically functional, but has numerous sharp edges. For example:
- it's not uncommon for Roman cohorts to spend the whole game deactivated
- Julius Caesar cannot command units, even in self defence
- charging the rear of a unit is no different to charging a flank
- leaders other than the overall commanders give no bonuses to stacked troops (yet overall commanders cannot, uh, command, see above)
- the map in places is physically too small to have units in adjacent points and blocks (to, you know, fight)
- ships at full ramming speed simply grind to a halt if not activated!
- the game comes with 2d6 and 1d10, then asks you to roll 'a die' or '2d12'

Worst of all (from my perspective) the game doesn't seem to have been playtested. Not only did the rule errors slip through, but the game can go on for many hours with no victor in sight (in my games, 5+ hours with no victory locations changing hands). It may very well be a superb historical simulation (I wouldn't know), but for me it fails as a game. It's one of those releases that makes you think, "you could make a great game with these components... pity this isn't it".

(Traded).

A very good game well thought out,good historical flavor built in;replayablity limited,due to the historical situation;I like how the navy aspect is interograded into the game;a lot more "What If's" could have players returning to this game more often.

The tactical challenges are great, but in my opinion, there is a bit too much from Simple GBoH in the rules - I would have preferred two variants instead. The map is beautiful, though.

For some inexplicable reason, this game failed to grab me. I can't point out any serious fault, and the situation is certainly compelling, but it just fell flat. Perhaps I should give it another look.

Worst in the series. Main concern: the counters don't fit at all in the small district spaces; it is thus hard to play with the components as provided. The unclear urban fight rules are not helping, either.

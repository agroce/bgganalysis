I have the later &quot;Samurai Swords&quot; edition. Very luck dependent game and one that has the cardinal sin of knocking someone out of the game early so that they can watch the rest of the game. Would have been better as a turn or year based game so that it would end before anyone was elliminated.

Ikusa is a great war game if you're looking for one that is intense, doesn't last days and days, and is much deeper than Risk.
I think this is my favorite war game to date, though I haven't tried a whole lot besides Risk and it's variations, and Axis and Allies.

Nice components & thematic. But the game shows its age, especially its combat system (which is too luck dependent, with very little luck mitigation). Combined with a very long play time (5 hrs+), is guaranteed to not hit the table very often (if at all). Nostalgia is what keeps the game on my shelf (being my first non-mass market boardgame).

Might appeal to players who like Risk (as this game takes Risk to the next level).

Have spent many a happy hour playing this.  Someone told me it was a bit like Risk when they tempted me to play it.  In fact, it's far superior and contains many times the depth.  Lots of fun, and plays much more like a light-wargame than a board game.  The pieces are amongst the best in a mainstream game (ie you could buy it in a toyshop).  It's always nail-biting to bid on various things, decide whether you need fortresses or whether to risk employing the dreaded ninja!  It scales well with player numbers from 3-5.

I always liked this one a little better than Axis and Allies--I liked the bidding mechanism for turn order and certain services (like the ninja), as well as the ability to hide ronin in certain provinces (though it was generally easy to figure out where they were hiding anyway).

I have the "Samurai Swords" edition which preceded Ikusa, but had a lot of the same artwork as the original Shogun version.

Which one?  Yes, at once.Fun!  Those ronin were great.  I think some people forgot that you couldn't have unlimited ronin, that you could only have as much ronin as one less than the occupying army in the same province...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Samurai Swords (Shogun) is a game for 5 players. It's the 16th century - the Age of War in Japan. On the provincial battlegrounds, daimyo leaders draw up their armies. Samuria warriors don battle armor; peasant farmers take up spears and guns. For each ambitious daimyo, a lifetime of military training is put to the final test. As a Japanese warlord, your lead your diamyos to victory or defeat! Conquer provinces, then guard them well with castles and fortifications. Decide where and when to attack - and how many troops to levy. Will it be a concentrated attack on an adjacent province; a risky naval invasion; or a seige on a well-defended enemy castle? Could a samuria ronin ambush or a sudden ninja strike pay off? Collect income as a reward for provincial conquest.

Expected playing time is 3 - 4 hours.

RATING: 6
Juego estilo Risk o Ataque en el Japón Feudal, en el sentido de conquistar territorios lanzando muchos dados. Con un sistema de combate por etapas (distancia y cuerpo a  cuerpo) y subastas al inicio de las rondas,que le da más complejidad e inmersión.

Eso si, es más difícil arrasar de un lado del mapa al otro como en el Risk, hay bastante combate, pero no tanto, cosa que puede molestar a algunos y a otros gustar. Lo otro es el problema del desmarque, si uno va con mucha desventaja es casi imposible que remonte y puede ser una partida tediosa para él. Además, es un juego de 4 horas, y la verdad las unidades que no son ejército poco tienen que hacer, dando como resultado muchos combates aburridos de ejércitos matando unidades sueltas, por lo que el tiempo de duración no se ve recompensado suficiente.

Los componentes son una maravilla, las figuras y el mapa están muy bien hechos, dan una gran impresión estética.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The best of MB's gamemaster series. The territory placement seemed too random though, which took some marks off this title. Its really unfortunate for one to be starting in middle Honshu. The combat system is more fun than in Axis and Allies, and the turn bidding mechanism is a plus.

Pretty epic game... Maybe a bit too epic. First 3-player game took 3 hrs (with pizza eating involved). And the dice tend to turn me off. There was an exchange when one player clearly had troop advantage (in numbers and Samurai) but ended up losing all his troops at the end of the fighting (it was close). Luckily, I was the uninvolved player, so I got to take advantage and eventually win (with the 35 territories controlled). 

3-players tends to be a bad number for these kinds of wargames, so maybe that contributed to the slowness of the game. We spent a lot of time poking around and feeling each other out, wanting to let the other two players ruin each other. 

I'm not a fan of having that happen. But it's still a solid game.

RATING: 8.5
My personal favourite of the Gamemasters series, Shogun has the most room for varietal gameplay due to  a random setup.
This is a gorgeous game from components to play aids to the exquisite mapboard. One really feels like playing in feudal Japan.
Point of fact: Shogun is about player elimination! That's what becoming Shogun is all about. It's NOT a flaw in the game. Deal with it.
Shogun is a wargame. Daimyos (generals) improve only with victories. The use of mercenaries, fortifications and especially the Ninja make or break a strategy, but basic tactical skill in choosing your opponent's weakest point and exploiting it is still the dominant strategy.
Yes, dice rolling luck is a component of the game. But that's what happens on battlefields. Sometimes you have to take a chance, face down the odds and take your lumps. Usually you should count on losing one Daimyo early to eliminate a fortress, consolidate key territory or similar. The best Shogun players know how to sacrifice to gain advantage.
Cons: Initial setup can be tedious and the first few rounds of consoidation can create imbalances. Good diplomacy can overcome these imbalances most of the time, but not always. Generally, the north has more strategic advantage than the south, especially the islands where you do NOT want to get stuck.
This is a game that could use some subtle redesign and a reissue.

Best of the Gamemaster series in my opinion.  If you enjoy Risk or Axis and Allies this will probably blow you away.

Starts with the basic rolling-dice-with-dudes-on-a-map format and adds blind bidding, variable turn order, staggered combat, and other nifty stuff.  The rules aren't overly complicated, which allows even new players to look beyond the rules and focus on strategy.

Tentative rating based upon 1 play.  Can you believe that I've never played this before?  I had a good learning experience, but it's a game where you really need to go into the game knowing what you are doing. I'll do better next time. It also seemed to drag a little towards the end. Don't know if that is a common experience.  Blind bidding in an american game from 20 years ago.  Who would've thunk it?

On the whole, a brilliant game. Think 'Risk', but not appallingly, painfully rubbish. At heart it's all about getting large armies and being the last one standing, which is it's only real flaw. So, apart from being a seriously long knock-out-mechanic game (ouch), it has depth and wonder and looks lovely. Getting to choose the troop type make up of your armies really is good fun and the options of building/recruitment etc are always tantalisingly impossible to successfully complete. If you have a spare entire day, three friends and some back-up games that take two players, it will not disappoint.

Milton Bradleys best Games Master series. Ahead of its time interms of design and production. Available through high street toy stores. Many of today's big-box games ape this MB series that I regard it with a fondness reserved usually reserved for aging relatives. Component and models quality was excellent.
I've giving this an uprated mark as this game along with MB's Space Crusade formed the corner stones of my future love for board games and they should both be feted for that alone, even if newer designs have surpassed both games technically.

RATING: 7
Game of military conquest, ending when you contorl most of the map, thus no need for complete subjugation of your opponent(s).  Winning requires intelligent use of generals, provincial forces, and defensive fortifications. Cool aspects include building of castles, fortresses, utilizing assassins, experienced generals. Japanese theme in enjoyable. Materials of good quality and rule book is great, with many illustrations. Some negatives are lots of dice rolling, no terrain modifiers (except for naval invasion), only one resource. With more players there is considerable downtime, with an occasional defense roll or two. 
I love the turn sequence, having to bid to choose play order, get ninja, and secretly recruit forces. I would classify this as a medium difficulty wargame.

This is a great game and we enjoy it, though it's not the greatest for two players, and we often don't have anyone else to play with.  We sometimes use some extra cards I downloaded a couple years ago that add a bit more chance to the game, because you never know when someone may buy an alliance or send some barbarians to attack or make you have a famine.

UPDATE: [1.8.18] - Traded for TI3: Shards of the Throne

Hiring the Ninja is perhaps one of "the" best moves you can make in any board game ever.  I haven't played this game since college (1996-2000) and don't remember enough to get it a rating.  However, the bidding mechanic of allocating "koku" to determine the order of actions or actions during your turn is one of the best analytical aspects of any board game I've ever played - Hiring the Ninja being one of those options. 

TRADING NOTE: Game is near mint condition.  All pieces and rules still in tact.

The game is Risk set in Feudal Japan with special figures - "army" figurines that represent armies which can expand and move in special ways, ronin that can conduct secret attacks/defenses, and a ninja which can spy or assasinate army generals to help you defeat armies.

Really, though, it's not much different at all from Risk, strategy-wise.  We played last night and it was clear that most of the elements of the game that were different from Risk were also totally unnecessary - we spent most of our money on troops, not building fortresses or hiring Ronin or the ninja.

A disappointment.

Not a good 2 player game like Axis and Allies is. Get 5 players and its a blast! It will take a while to play a whole game (5-6 hrs). A super game with a big toy factor. Neat pieces. A nice step up from Risk with more replayability over time than Axis and Allies.

I purchased this game in the early '90s. A few years ago, I was leaving my apartment and noticed a blue gunner on the ground. At first, I thought it had fallen out of the box while I was moving into the apartment a few months earlier. Then I noticed a game board sticking out of the trash. Someone, in a neighboring apartment had thrown away an entire game! A few of the pieces were damaged. However, I was able to save over 90% of the contents to add to my game.

My favorite dice rolling, grand strategy, RISK style, military conquest game (the very definition of Ameritrash).  However, due to the length of time it takes to play, I have been having trouble finding people to play with since the mid 1990s.  I really need to get this bad boy on the table again.

In my opinion this was best of the Game Masters games.  Fortress America was next, Axis & Allies 3rd., Conquest of the Empire 4th, and Broadsides and Boarding Parties dead last.  It's a fun game, and worth picking up in the reprint they did.  Has a few issues but doesnt distract too badly.  Gotta get used to the bidding part.  If it were offered up to play, I would.  I never owned, but would never offer up the big bucks on Ebay.

Needs to be played with 5 experienced gamers who know what it takes to win a game. It can crash if someone just tag along with another and dont understand what is going on, and dont know when to break an alliance.

My only memories of this game are someone always getting slaughtered in the first few turns.  The huge armies is a neat concept, but a bit too much luck in the rolls, and once you lose an army you're pretty much fried.  Alternately, everybody plays it conservatively and it goes on forever.  Guh.  Of course, I played this while I was a kid, so who knows.

RATING: 10
My only "10". My favorite boardgame ever, so long as you have 4+ people (it's really frustrating with 2 or 3). The board is always in such flux, such motion, that you can sit back and watch the spinning yin and yang of colors whorl as the turns go by. There are so many ways to get at board sections that you never really see that Australia stronghold strategy from Risk crop up. And if you *do* see it start to happen, you have enough time to *do* something about it. Once the daimyos are up to a 3, you really have to think ahead and be alert, which is something I've always liked about this game -- otherwise you always end up surprised as to how easily assailable you are. Great, great game. Stupendous fun.

My favorite quote from this game is "Where are the ronin?", which we have cited off on and off for nearly twenty years now. Someone in our group dumped every coin they had into obtaining ronin for one spot and then taunted us with that phrase repeatedly -- and then their precious ronin got annihilated that very turn. Cue mass gloating.

This has been a completely unbiased review, of course. ;-)

Was a great game when I played as a kid.  It has too many pieces for a short play wargame.  You invest nearly half the game time in set up.  The small plastic pieces haven't held up well at all over the years. 

Still, good effort on the detail on the figures and the map design on the tri-fold board is efficient and elegant.

My absolute fave of the MB games. Not as mired in technological tidbits as Axis & Allies, Shogun is simpler to play but harder to master than the other MB games.

Liked it enough. But perhaps 5 players is too tough for the guys stuck in the middle. The ends of the island as much easier to defend. Japan maps are always a problem just like in Shogun and Senji.

Quite a fun game but felt a bit too much like risk to me but then it seemed much better than risk. Going last on the first turn seemed very useful to get ahead of the game as anything you gained could not be taken off you and then you would have more provinces for the next turn and extra cash. Hmmm would like to be trying this again sometime soon. 2 Plays.

Why is this not called Shogun?

My first big game. Perhaps my first boardgame (after a chess set I got when I was ten and which I still own). I know mum and dad played snakes and ladders and checkers and chinese checkers and backgammon and cluedo and things like that with the kids but they were their games. This one was given to me since I liked Samurai and the like.

Still a good game after all these years, takes a few hours to play. Luck can take precedence over skill, he who hires the ninja can be in an advantage, especiallly in a two player game but I like it and think it's worth playing.

I happen to like Risk, so I think there are aspects of this game that make it much more strategic and enjoyable.  The Army cards are great and basically work as heroes.  

Problems I have:
  I don't love games where players are eliminated.
  There can be a bit of waiting when one player is acting out his wage war phase.
  Game can stall and get very long as two players battle back and forth.

Same thing as with risk to me, is the problem of too much dice rolling randomness with few ballancing factors, for such a game of such length.

As opposed to Risk this game gives you some things to do durig play wich pepps it up a bit even when youre on the loosing side.
Bidding mechanic in gameturns for every step allong the way. Hiring troops, Building fortresses., hiring the Ninja.
You have three armies that can level up
The theme is transported beautifully.

Better than obvious siblings Axis and Allies and Risk because the Sengoku-period-pastiche theme makes for nice backstabby fun that the rigid alliance structures of WWII can't bring to the table.

The game does have the tendency like most of the older games to eliminate people which is a negative.

The funny thing is Milton Bradly has discontinued this game many times.However this game was 2nd best in the Game Master Series. I have played this game many times with friends. In fact we devised new additional rules which I ahve published for personal use and I will provide such rules for a small fee. My rules give the game some added benefits and are actually based on how Japan Functioned in the given time in which the game is played.

1st Edition, Shogun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light but thematic wargame with interesting mechanics. I especially like the hidden planning system, which creates much tension (rating +2). The game needs aggressive play, though, or it will bog down. However, the game can take long even when players are aggressive. Most of our games have lasted about 5 hours . This is too long considering that it is primarily a light tactical game - you can't plan ahead much (rating -1). Secondly, this is an elimination game - never a good idea (rating -1). Worse yet, often a player is not eliminated immediately. The player is forced to participate for several hours without any real hope of recovery (rating - 2) There is much incentive to take out a medium sized player (because of territorial gain) but attacking a heavily fortified position of a very small player can be too risky - the attack may seriously weaken the attacking player enabling other players to take advantage. Note that I have not played the new release (Ikusa) but the old edition from 80’s. Nonetheless, I found the art and components of the game OK.

I think perhaps mechanically superior to its Gamemaster bretheren, but the theme doesn't grab me as much as Axis & Allies or Fortress America.

After years of owning this game, I finally got a chance to play it in fall of 2005. It was a little too Risk-like for my tastes. I suppose I should not have purchased it oh-so-many years ago. I traded it in March 2006 for Barbarians and The Black Prince.

RATING: 8
This last of the GameMaster Series of games I think Shogun has the most balanced set of rules and the highest replay-ability of all five. Although random set up can be harsh, the game rewards a players diplomatic as well as tacical skills.

A game with great appeal for new gamers. There are a lot of excrutiating decisions, especially regarding how to spend your koku. The only negative is that people have to be eliminated as the game progresses.

What a great game, and so hard to find these days.  They made an updated version of the original, but it reminds me too much of the Conquest of the Empire redux.  The best part about this game was the Ninja strike, especially because you could screw over your enemy if they did poorly on it.

Downtime is insanely high. Combat is too random and too long (especially with low cost troops and players kept rolling misses).
Secret action bidding is pointless (players mostly spent money on building and training as bidding turn order is not necessary, ronin are too restricted, ninja is too random).
Components are average (trays are terrible) , except the swords.
Ultimately, there are some fun to be had (if playing with house rules about ronin, ninja and turn order), but it is an outdated risk-styled game. Recommend Shogun (with the cube tower) instead.

Probably my most favorite game of all I own. Had the 1st edition from 1986. Moved away and gave it to a friend. Once I got back into boardgaming twenty years later, I just had to get ahold of another copy (ebay). It's still wonderful.

Best with four I think...in a five player game, someone tends to get eliminated relatively early.

Given the time it takes to play it rarely sees the table, but that's where the SSSPG come to the rescue (http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/SSSPG). In fact, they now have a web-based version:  http://sdtaulbee.members.winisp.net/Shogun/default.aspx

One of the better ones in the Milton Bradley Gamemaster series.  I love the bidding and combat system.  The only problem is that the middle of the board is no-man's land.  Very difficult to win if you start there.
Update: Reduced from a 7 to 6. A recent play has magnified some of the problems with this game.  There is little incentive to knock off a player's army (assuming it isn't his last).  So it can be turtle-prone.  My thought was the ninja was there to prevent this from happening.  In this recent game though, it did the opposite.  I was ninja'ed 4 times and was reduced to turtling.

Shogun is a classic from the old Milton Brady days. I have very fond memories playing this game a couple of years back. 

I always had a good time whenever we played Shogun. I haven`t played it enough. The time I played, it took about 8 hours. It was a rather close. it was a 5 player, one of them with the help with someone else, we elimited one of players completely killing all three of this armies. Now as a four player, every was very careful not to losing too much. If you become too weak, you can be an easy prey to kill of one of your 3 armies.

Received Samurai Swords ans Shogun in a game trade. So now, I own two copies, the 1st and 2nd edition.

Haven't played since I got my own copy. Looking forward to playing it again.

This was the game that succeeded Axis & Allies for me.  It scratched the same itch for me and did it better.  For one, the setup is different each time so strategies are different depending on your starting positions.  Secondly, alliances aren't set and diplomacy, and the inevitable betrayal, become part of the game.  

Unfortunately, I seldom have time to sit down for a long enough session to fit this game into anymore.  And when I do, I much prefer to play several shorter games instead.  For a dudes-on-a-map strategy/war game, this oldie is still a goodie.  Rating mostly based on nostalgia.

Much like Axis&Allies, this game requires a full and dedicated group of players to fully enjoy. The rules and mechanics are far simpler, but follow the same pattern. The campaigning armies are a unique feature, but can also lead to stalemates later in the game. A good step between light wargames (Risk) to heavier ones (Axis&Allies). Comes with huge sums of detailed peices and an easy to use map board for play.

this is a good game if you have enough people devoted to playing it.  it can drag on forever--wins are often the last player to stay awake... the battle mechanic is nice, very simular to axis and allies, but more fun.  a few house rules can greatly improve play.

More than Risk combat, with separate ranged & melee attacks.  More than Risk board management, with defensive works, special armies, mercenaries, assassins, etc.  I am a fan of random-setup games of this type, as well.  Even though I almost never play it now, I'll probably always be fond of Shogun.

Good Risk-like game.  It builds upon Risk by having units with varying skill level, having 'generals', adding some attacking via the ocean, as well as having castles you can build.

3 player took about 3 1/2 hours.  1st time for 2, other player last played 20 years ago.

If I'm in the mood for a dice chucker I may grab this over risk.

After only six years of owning this, I finally got to play a five-player game.  I was annihilated about halfway through, but I still had a great time.  In my opinion, it's easily the deepest and most replayable of the Gamemaster Series, and one I look forward to playing again.

the best RISK variant I know (don't know many, though). Last played when I was around 18 . don't know whether I would still like it as much as then, because it has a lot of downtime (which is - however - not unusual for these kind of wargames i guess :-(

I was never a huge fan of Risk or Axis & Allies, but this game is the best of the "world domination" games that I've played. It certainly takes some time to learn, and even more to play. The ability of the Diamyo to tear across the board, decimate something, and then retreat to the back lines is awesome.

I don't remember much about this game other than bribing the ninja. Bribe the ninja! Bought it at Toys R Us in the '90s for a super marked down price (box damaged, all components in pristine shape) and only played it once. I remember it being OK, but like Axis and Allies it's just too involved for me.

Used to have this game... way too long to play... provinces in Japan are divided to so many little parts that it looks like there are more territories than Risk.

RATING: 5
An awesome game.  I once read a review that said playing this was akin to trying to conquer sifting sand...but that's the part I love about it.  Plus one of my favorite dice rolling combat systems, ever.

It is certainly a "light" wargame, but there are several decisions to make above and beyond your typical 'chuck the dice' game like Risk.  The value of units you sacrifice in combat, how much you need to try to hire the Ninja (or to win him just to protect your lvl 3 Daimyo from him), how much to spend on troops, where to place fortifications (if you lose them after building them, the conquerer gets all the benefits and you're simply out the cash...unless you take it back from him).

I'd place this at Axis and Allies complexity level, but because the start-up is not static, to me this one doesn't lose its luster even after multiple plays. 

I'm glad I bought this one, it's truly a gem.



EDIT:  re-visited this recently...game length is KILLER.  Plus I've become spoiled by card-driven games that add excitement.  This is still a solid game, but I'm no longer sure it's worth the time ivestment.  Down from 7.5 to 6.


EDIT 2:  Traded away 01/27/09.

I played this a few times.  It is a very long game, but heck - its a LOT of fun.  Like other MB games, it has a lot of little plastic figures, swords, Koku, and fortresses - add to the charm.  I bought a similar online version (Shogun: Total War), but its just not as fun a the board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yeah, so Shogun suffers from all the things one would expect from a 1980s Milton Bradley wargame, but it succeeds in all the ways you want it to as well: wonderful plastic goodness, very decent extra rules built on a Risk architecture, and a secret purchase for actions which works very well, and frankly I can't think of many games that use this mechanic. It can play rather long, but the time goes by fast and it still feels like it ends at the right time. Shogun is a near-perfect blend of 1980s Ameritrash and wargaming.

Great memories of playing this in college (as Samurai Swords). I had to pick up this latest rendition, as the board is quite beautiful, as are the pieces. It is, IMO, the absolute best of the Game Master series games, and one of the best dudes on a map game. The sad thing is though, by comparison to today's games, this takes a long time to finish- at least 5 hours with 3 players, so it hasn't much chance of seeing the light of day.

A decent game, a good mixture of Risk and Axis & Allies for light wargamers.  Your generals experience is a big influence, you can bid for turn order so the game is very fluid and has the best replayability of the strategy war games I have seen.  Unfortunetaly Shogun often takes VERY LONG to play in excess of 5 hours though due to slow turns and slow battles.  Don't let players with AP (analysis paralysis) play or it'll never end!!

Sort of a souped-up Risk, with subtlety added in the form of units with special powers or "to hit" numbers as in Axis & Allies.

I've played this twice, and probably wouldn't bother with it again. Even the quick version results in a very long (5-6 hour) game, and there we found that it didn't really offer enough to justify that investment of time. It's also far too easy for players to get caught in a vicious circle, where they have no chance of victory but are still stuck in the game for hours. The game components are excellent, though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Except in the two-player game, the piece limitations make it very hard to win except by killing off one of your opponent's final Daimyo. I dislike how this premium on delivering the Coup de Grace forecloses other strategic options. Using extra pieces can mitigate this problem.

This is what Risk ought to be, IMO.  Shogun has a nice blend of luck, strategy, tactics, and diplomacy - and the bits are terrific.  It's a long game, though, and it can drag noticeably when played with slow players.  For my money, this is the best of the Milton Bradley Gamemaster series, and more replayable than the others because of the random starting locations.

A stylish, elegant alternative to Risk set in Japan, this game was a staple of my boardgaming youth.  It's not terribly complex, but there are a few interesting strategic options (although make no mistake, having more troops than your opponent is always a good idea).   The only drawback is it takes forever to play; we would usually leave it set up for weeks at a time and play it over several 2-hour sessions.

Still for it's time, it's something very speical.

I love a samurai theme (I live in Japan and have for well over a decade), but this game has some mechanics issues that break it for me.  I don't like that you have troop limits in your territories, for one thing.  There's a lot more I don't like about the game, and if I cared enough I would house rule it.  But there are just better lite wargames out there and this theme has been replicated on numerous video games over the years (from the 8-bit Nobunaga's Ambition to the modern Shogun 2) so why bother?  Especially since one of the biggest drags on this game is the time between turns when your group gets bigger than two.

General comments:
This is a great game with fantastic innovations that come together very well. A shame that other games have not incorporated this type of mechanics: the hidden planning / economic system / mercenaries are simply brilliant in balance. Comments as Risk in Japan or too much depending on starting position are the biggest crap I have ever heard. Ever heard of diplomacy?! The uncrowned empress of my game collection!

The only point is the that the victory conditions are lame. Conquer 35 areas....well this takes as long as a real civil war amongst experienced players.
Cards 'Risk' style or special action cards would have been a ggod improvement.

Recent play and upped the rating of this beauty. A classic in my books.

Feels a lot like Risk on the surface but is a definite upgrade to the simplistic mechanisms of Risk.  While it's better than Risk it certainly falls to the same pitfalls as Risk with player elimination and the fact that it takes a long time.

I've only played once, but if I never played it again I'd be ok with that.  This is one of those games that you need to be in the mood for AND have a good 4-6 hours or so to dedicate to playing it.  Pray that you don't get eliminated within the first hour if you do set aside this much time to play.

RATING: 7
An elegant and classic dudes-on-a-map strategy game.
Incomparable to the sad luck fest that is Risk, nor to the eternal, glacier-like Axis&Alies. 

The setup of separate armies with limited numbers of first strike units is a brilliant game element, as is the continuous upgrading for generals who gain extra movement and attacks.
However, as the game gains momentum through quicker and more random player actions (play order is determined randomly), the finale can feel reduced to a cat&mouse situation with decisive luck involved.

Still one of the best dudes on a map.

Excellent Game (always want to play it).

Another great Milton Bradley "Gamemaster Series" game, 2nd best in the Series (after Fortress America). 

Better mechanics than Axis & Allies (e.g., blind purchasing and bidding, order of attack) but not as many optional add ons. Almost as good as Fortress America. 

Well worth playing again and again.

RATING: 3
Loose poorly worded rules. I'm hence not 100% confident we played it correctly...

If we did then it's a very poor game indeed. The deployment rules are messy and unstructured, the combat is a bit crap.

The map is nice and with better mechanics it might be great

Risk variant is a nice design, with a number of clever elements, but is inordinately long, and suffers from the ability of players to pull back the leader.  Ultimately one player may win through as the others start to consider hare kiri as a viable alternative to playing on (and on).

Hooked by the GeekList 'Most Overproduced Games Ever' (sounds like my kind of game...), I had an eye on this for a while as a potential acquisition. Then, spotted one on ebay with a short auction time remaining and only about $20 bid, so I had a punt. Snagged it. Postage was twice that in dollars, but all in, you're talking about a Euro cost equivalent to a new game, and not one of this 'big box' size, not in Ireland (around say 40-50 euro all in - something like Starcraft or World of Warcraft goes for nearly 100). As such, I'm happy. Now, will my gaming group be prepared to invest 4-5 hours playing time...?

A nice reprint of the old M&B Shogun game - unfortunately without the player order swords (which are replaced by tokens.

RATING: 7
An attempt at a more strategic version of Risk, with different troop types, castles, even bidding for turn order etc. Tons of great miniatures, although being moulded in polystyrene means that they are deperately fragile. Rather long winded, armies take casualties faster than they can be replenished which means the game end is a long time coming.

Essentially Risk with unit differentiation played on an odd-shaped, fairly featureless map.  Woe to a player who gets stuck in the middle by the random setup.  Some of the different unit types are interesting, I guess, but I can't imagine why I would play this game over a superior game like Axis & Allies or Buck Rogers.  In fairness, it's probably a better multi-player wargame than Risk, but that's a very low bar for me.

Players each control a Shogun & 3 Daimyos. Players use there Daimyos to conquer other players territory & defend their own. Turn order changes from turn to turn by drawing swords (which is like drawing straws). players bid Koku secretly on this action as well as: building, levying units, hiring Ronin, & the Ninja.

We always use random setup to make the game slightly different each time (one of the things I dislike about the A&A games I've played is how the game seems somewhat scripted).

The best of the Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. Non-fixed starting locations, and the use of roving armies and providence forces helps to create unique board positioning between players. Shogun also benefits from a bidding mechanic that forces interesting economic decisions, and adds a bit of a bluffing element especially when it comes to bidding for the ninja.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (May 2011)

It’s been a long time since I last played Samurai Swords. I played the Milton Bradley edition and I remember I was impressed by the components (the swords are great). I also remember it has some similarities to Twilight Imperium 3rd edition (or so I thought at the time). The game is very long and, sadly, we didn’t finished our only play.

I have changed a lot during the years. Now, I always prefer to play Euro games so even I’m rating Samurai Swords a 6.0. I remember I liked it very much, but my desire to play it again is rather low (however 6.0 is still a pretty high rating). If I do I will come back to write a proper comment.

Current Rating: 6.0

A very good game from my youth. Loved the theme, loved the variety, loved the big armies, loved the ninja. Economics, planning, castles, and war. Great bits and the swords for turn order rock.

In my opinion, probably the best balance of dice-rolling to pure strategy in a wargame that i have played so far - with excellent components. The rules are very well written and this is actually not a very complicated game. The downside is the length of a game and player elimination - so play it with 2 (it's better than risk).

Awesome risk-like game. You have samurai swords! Btw, also the recent name of the remade game. Hire mercenaries and slice off your enemy's heads!

I like the combat sequence of d12s. Range hits before Melee. [b]Very cool to see massive armies battle it out. [/b]

Would be a 10, but it's so loooong, it doesn't get played enough.  A terrific "epic scale" game in the spirit of Risk or Axis and Allies, but several rules, including each player having 3 "armies", and combat order in which missles go first followed by hand-to-hand, dramatically suppresses luck compared to similar games.  The components are beautiful; it's fun just to set up the board to look at it!  Lots of opportunities for negotiation and diplomacy. A very rich and textured game.

I love Shogun, but a lot of that love is because I love the era it represents and I had a lot of fun playing it when I was younger. However, it *is* a dice fest. If the dice aren't being too kind or too mean, you have a great game. However, I've seen battles where a few troops decimate an entire army. Maybe using a D10 or D8 would help a bit, I'm not sure. Still, lots of fun and there's cool bits to play with. Just don't take it too seriously when bad die rolls ruin your best laid plans.

This is what every Risk player wish they could play.  The strategy, dimplomacy, and planning are all balanced by the tides of war.  Intuitively it plays well, but planning, cunning awareness of your opponents strategies and delicate use of the ninja all make this game the best of this genre.  Every game is different b/c of random setup, but everyone has a chance.  It seems to mimic what I know of military strategy and basic rules of conquer or be conquered, but don't stretch yourself too thin.  Trouble is finding people with the guts to play such a big looking game.  Great pieces, great screens, and a unique feel.

Classic from the MB Gamemaster Series. Although some gaming elements remind of Risk and Axis&Allies, this is clearly the better of these three. The focus of the game are the build-up and strategic use of the three armies (which are limited in mix of different troops). Of course, a bit of skillfull diplomacy and/or a geographical concentration of your forces will be needed to dominate the required territory. Minor points are the game length and the need to eliminate other players to finish the game (at least one, probably more).

RATING: 7.5
The most frequently played boardgame in my high-school gaming group; gathering dust since leaving university, though. Captures very well the spirit and colour of feudal Japanese warfare, and its familiarity has contributed to the creation of a number of humourous rituals for honouring or disgracing exceptional or poorly performing units. Play balance can be skewed by a poor deal of provinces at the start, which can cripple inexperienced or poor players.

The Sengoku period in fuedal Japan has intrigued me to no ends. As this is the only boardgame I own to reflect the era I love it dearly . House rules have ' filled ' some rule discrepancies and a more streamlined Ninja now threatens high level daimyo.

Very nice revision of an old game. As I understand it, the rules are basically as previous version, but the game components have been revised and the artwork is all new.

I'm really loving this game! The game is more dynamic than Axis & Allies, but more structured than Risk. I think this is because the movement or forces is more limited thsn in Risk, but much more dynamic than Axis & allies. While provincial forces are stuck to the traditional 'move one province' per turn, the armies get to move twice per turn, and can expand their movement and combats per turn with greater experience. The ronin and ninja add a nicely balanced suprise element.

They've done a great job with revising the 'look & feel' of the game. I do have several complaints however. One of the armies is sort of a 'brick red' color, which I wish had been made slightly more red. There's a bit color confusion between the brick red army and its components, and the light brown army and its components. The screen and army board for the 'brick red' army actually use a darker brown instead of the same redish color of the army. Adding to the confusion is that screen for the brick red army uses the wrong clan symbols. Instead of using the proper symbols, they are a repeat of the purple armies clan symbols.

Old Classic, components in a very good state. I saw this in a store when I was young and I had played Axis and Allies before, and fell in love with all the plastic.

Did not finish a whole game yet but it game me an idea . The game seems to scale well with multiple player (2-5 ?). Initial Random army placement adds replayability and chaos (the good type of chaos). this game almost forces you to create alliances. The combat is similar to Axis and Allies, but I prefer the overall feel of shogun. If I had a choice between Axis and allies or Shogun, I would get Shogun(also called samurai swords)

Definately one of the better MB Gamesmaster games. Things like troop costs seem well playtested and thought-out, and the one-piece-per-province limit on new troops is a great idea (with temporary ronin for when you really want a temporary surge in forces somewhere). More reasons than in similar games to go on the offensive (daimyo experience on top of money aspects), little incentive to 'turtle up'.

Like most multiplayer area conflict games, your experience will vary greatly depending on what kind of group you play with.

If you have an aggressive, wild group, you'll have a lot of unpredictable fun. If your group is cautious and/or AP prone, the game will go forever until someone gets bored and decides to attack someone at random, thus becoming an arbitrary kingmaker and frustrating everyone who wasted a whole day playing it.

My father, who is perhaps the ultimate cautious, AP player, described my introduction of this game to the family as like "bringing out a trunk full of lice". YMMV.

While this game was one of the series of MB games that included Axis and Allies, I think this one was the most noteworthy, in that introduced a blind bidding system (for things like turn order, reinforcments, and a ninja assassin) that was decades ahead of its time.

I personally think this is the best game in the MB gamemaster series.  I love the fact that you can hire a ninja and ronin to do your work.  The components were fantastic for their time. Today the figures would have been made of a more durable plastic.

Great medieval Japan wargame.  What I like the most in this game is the way you can defend your territory.  I am a sucker for good defense and I like this in a wargame.

It can be a tad long though, which is why it's not a game that see the light of day really often.

Thanks to Wizards, I finally had my chance to get this 25 years after its initial release. It really did stand the test of time ([i]big time[/i]), it's everything that I've hoped to be. With so much flashier, theme and feature stuffed conquest games around lately, Shogun with its tricky set of planning options is still an outstanding piece of work in its relative (and much welcomed) simplicity.

Good, solid wargame, but losing a Daimyo really puts you at a disadvantage for the rest of the game. But I guess that's the point, kill the other Daimyo's. 

Not really a game for those who like the "solitaire, not in with a chance of winning but still doing things until the end of the game & maybe even being the Kingmaker" sort of game.

More the sort of game of "you just got eliminated, get me a beer from the fridge before you go play some wimpy filler"

The version I have is called Samurai Swords, but I guess Ikusa is latest iteration of the same game, or close to it.  This is from the same family of Milton Bradley games like Axis & Allies that came out in the 80's.  If ever play any of those games again this is the most likely candidate.

Maybe I've just had bad experiences with this one, but it played similarly to Risk for me.  In other words, every game of this I've played, I've been slaughtered despite the odds being extremely weighted in my favor, early in the game.  Found it way too dice heavy combat for a game with such a long setup and play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the best Risk type games produced and along with Fortress America, one of the best of the MB Gamemaster series.

This game is an Ameritrash classic.  Lots of direct conflict, Ronins,  Ninjas, bidding for initiative and well sculpted plastic pieces (but the plastic is a little too brittle).

Can be a bit long, and the 5 player game is bound to have at least one player quickly eliminated.  Probably best with 4 players.

A game that combines two of my favorite things in life: Japan and Risk. I first discovered this game Thank to my College Prof. and I have fell in love with it since. I hope to secure it for myself soon used, or I hope it gets a reissue soon. If they do reissue it I hope they keep the quality of the game the same and only revise some small things like, instead of styrafoam for the sword holders and castle bases, they should make them out of plastic so they resist wear.

Ikusa is brutal. Its cutthroat samurai action will throw you into the fray on the very first turn, and will not let up until the shogun is determined. Lots of dice rolling, but I don't mind it at all, since it's all about mobilizing and commanding your troops right. The game has been around for 30 years, so I dare say it has stood to the test of time. It's a pity they didn't include the plastic swords (as in the previous editions), yet the presentation definitely does justice to the evergreen theme, all in all making for the best Sengoku Jidai strategy game there is.

I have the original Shogun from 1986. I love this game! It has the easy, fun strategy aspect of Risk you used to love as a kid. But it's also much more developed and has a few cool mechanisms that make it more interesting. 

You have 3 generals who control huge stacks of doom and can collect experience. You can hire Ronin to use as cannon fodder to protect your noble Samurai Swordsmen. You can build fortresses to protect your lands. And there's a Ninja who can murder your opponent's generals! And you get a little plastic sword to determine initiative - with a sword stand made out of styrofoam. Awesome!

The rulebook is total chaos though. There's a reorganized version that you can download from the web somewhere - and optional rules for faster games.

There's a remake called Ikusa - though the components there aren't as cool as they are in the original. Shamefur dispray!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although it was a terrific and groundbreaking game when it was released in 1986, game design has improved in the interim.  This game has fabulous mechanics, but it suffers because the resolution of player elimination often imbalances the progression of the game.  An expansion with some rules updates could really elevate the gameplay experience on what I feel is already a fantastic base game.

Stunning game. It is a Risk-like game but will provide you with more than this. Heavy war gaming style as there is (played mostly within 4player games) not much room for movement but for falling in someones back.

You own advancing army´s which can be a heavy pain in the ass as the can move and attack several times with many figures.

Recommended mostly for players which like a risk game with more tactical dept:
- spend money on several units and fortresses
- purchase Ninja to assasinate enemy army Daimos
- mass wage war as this is the heart of the game

You will end this game standing at the table and watching each dice to be thrown... Even if this war is not against you!

Originally known as 'Shogun' (the version I own) and part of MB's Game Master series with Axis & Allies and Fortress America, it was later rebranded as 'Samurai Swords' and then again in 2011 as 'Ikusa'. A very cool war game (very A&A-esque) where 16th century feudal Japan is your battleground.

This is the definitive game from the old MB line of the '80s.  I am rating my original copy of Shogun as that is the only version I own, and I have to say that it still outshines many of today's war games.  Best played with four or five people - the map has so many borders and ways of invading other players' territories that the ownership of lands is constantly in flux.  The random setup also means that your strategy will have to adapt to what the cards have given you.  My playgroup is always willing to bust this one out for an afternoon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The only downside to this game is the colorless board. Besides from that, the gameplay is great, the theme works with the mechanics which are original, complex enough to really feel deep, but simple and smooth enough to allow for a fun action-packed domination game that really feels like medieval Japanese samurai armies fighting. I think it has an edge over axis and allies which I also like.

[b]Shogun[/b] (aka Samurai Swords or Ikusa)

'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...', this had been a fun thing to play. 

It's an "Ameritrash" game where you battle with dice rolls. Different units/different strengths. Setting is feudal Japan.

Pros: far too many to remember and list (ex: sword draw to decide turn order/blind bid for turn order/hidden mercenary armies/ninja attacks on generals/defensive forts and castles)

Cons: game length and player elimination

I enjoy this game quite a bit.  It seems a little hard to teach people how to play game though.  Everyone goes for buying fortresses very early in the game despite my warnings.

Played this game a lot back in the day.  Whenever any of my group of friends wanted to play Risk, we broke out Shogun instead, and were completely satisfied.  It's a much better game than Risk, in my opinion.  A bit less luck is involved.  It's a bit high on the time scale, though.

Introduced to a game of Shogun/Samurai Swords years after they were out of print. Great RISK style game with an eastern flair. Finally found a used copy-missing parts & lack of interested players led me to get rid of it.

RATING: 4
Suffers from the same problems as Risk (elimination, I-go-you-go, king-making, unstoppable leader, etc.), but if you are in the mood for a more complex version of Risk, this may your game. It does offer some neat mechanics, like experienced commanders, limited attack fronts, ninja attacks (kind of like the Settlers of Catan thief being dropped on you), purchasing armies, bidding for turn sequence, bases, etc.But again, it's all just added on to basically a Risk game. It's in my top 30 list of games to play, but I rarely get past the top twenty in a year, so it's been sitting in my collection unplayed for about 10 years. 2/18/07: Gave to brother, have not, and likely will not play this game any time soon.

2014: My brother actually reported that he HATED this game. I was a little surprised by this, I didn't think it was THAT bad. He's gotten into the modern game scene, so I suspect he's correct though. Lowered to a "4".

The perfect middle between Risk and A&A.

Used to be one of my favs, but changing tastes and a lack of players let it slide down the list. In a recent visit back to hometown, I bestowed it to my friends with whom I enjoyed it the most.

Cons:

* Gunman are under powered.
* As it drags on, Players will make decisions based on how to end the game instead of winning.
* The original manual has an option for a "longer" game?!

Shogun is a fun game that can keep people occupied for hours with lots of battles and piece movement.  It is, however, a little hard to constantly keep track of the pieces and provinces.  Is also favours players who do not start in the middle of the map, as they're the ones who have to battle 2-front wars.  The game often takes in excess of 3 hours to complete - I've played games up to 8 hours and still not completed.  Plus, the rules are quite difficult to master.  But I've played it for years and have had several good battles and games.  This is one for the intermediate gamer, and definately one for those who aren't afraid of the dice roll and have alot of patience. Best played with more players.  Better than Risk or its derivatives.

Update:  I'm improving my rating here.  Its been a while since I've played and I'd like to give it another go.  Also, I must bow to the fact that THIS is the game that got me out of 'Parker Bros', monopoly-esque style of board game that most people associate with the hobby.  It started all those years ago when it was first Released as 'Shogun' and not 'Samurai Swords' (the latter being the copy that I own, the former being the one that I used to own but... disppeared?  Ah it was so many years ago I can't remember.. Sure wish I had the original, though.  Okay, thats enough writing.

Anyone who says this is 'just risk' really doesn't know what they're talking about, and I doubt they've played either game properly.

A beautifully-designed addition to the Gamemaster series. Purchased mostly for beautiful production value, being a fan of feudal Japanese history and speaker of Japanese as a second language.

I just don't have time in my life any more to spend the long time this game requires to be played well.

Had a chance to play it again with adults and while it is a long game with a slow wave of shifting advantages, it is well balanced and came down to one key move by three of the four players to bring it to an interesting conclusion.

A favorite childhood game. Risk+ in the Japanese Feudal Era. I have both the old Shogun version from the mid 80s and the newer Ikusa. The game doesn't hold up as well compared to more recent games, but it was a big deal for me and many others in the 80s. I absolutely adore the theme of Feudal Japan and will play this game more regularly because of it.

I think I'd rather play Risk. At least the combat is faster; in Risk, one die roll resolves battle.

Anyway, way too long for such a light game. Worse is that a player that's behind doesn't undergo a merciful quick death and elimination; that losing player (assuming that a player would try to defend to the bitter end) will have a boring game.

Samurai Swords -- If you dig Risk, this is the logical next step in my estimation.  I usually like Asian themes as well.  Like the description says,  Samurai Swords is the same game.

Think Axis&Allies in Feudal Japan, but there is no lasting permanent alliances, everyone is out to be the next shogun!

Lots of great memories in college playing this.

It's big, it's got cool blind bidding (even for turn order), the battles are fun, but something's still missing for me with this.

No, that's not it, because I love Conquest of the Empire, which also has the brown mark of player elimination.  Maybe I just haven't gotten the feel of it yet.

I haven't played it in a long time but that's really because my life lacks the free time and the gamer types who enjoy this game. It is a long game, with no built in time limit.

However, you buy resouces with koku, hire ninjas & ronin, construct fortresses, level up your daimyos, have access to spearmen, gunners, swordsmen, and the dreaded bowmen.

I really enjoy the combat system and how you need to balance your armies with a mix of melee & missile troops. The combat system creates tough decisions about which units you'll take as casualties as you weigh cost, fireing sequence, and odds.

I think logistics is represented fairly well, as your armies are limited to a certain size and configuration. You've got to use your daimyos just right to level them up and give yourself more flexibility without exposing yourself to opportunistic attacks by your opponents.

I think this game has great replayability because of the theme and mechanics. It would get more time except that I don't have the time or the players who are interested currently. Highly recommended if you come across it.

Looking back, I think the guy who owned this when I was a child explained the rules poorly, and we never got the most out of the game.

One that cost me a lot of money back then compared to others, but it was worth it. Although we didn't play often, the days we did are still in my memory. Diplomacy via notes and letters is essential for the fun though! It's difficult, if you play with 5 people, especially, if you end up in the middle of the map. But this can be rectified with the diplomacy element. And perhaps the ninja.

Great game, but not for lightweights.  The shortest game I played took 5 hours.  I love immersive games that take all day.

Nowadays it seems people only highly rate games that can be over and done in less than an hour, so it's hard to find people to play with unless you alter the rules.

Good game, nice sturdy board, cards, and pieces.  Good, straight forward instructions.  My only beef is that the ninja is pretty worthless except in the event that someone has only one person left in one of their armies.  Usually this game gets overturned by my friends in lieu of axis & allies.

A beautiful game with a lot of potential that delivers suprisingly little. It's a long, slow, highly competitive game of building up an empire, clashing with enemy generals (and getting vulched by a third) only to lose to whoever successfully suicide rushes with loads of spearmen on turn 5 for the magic number of 35 provinces.

Finally I got my hands on a game of Samurai Swords or Shogun as it's called in the Netherlands. I love this game. I played it as a child and although it is a typical Ameritrash game with a lot of dice, kingmaker, king basher, turtle, player elimination and downtime issues... I still love it! It is not the best MB Gamemaster series game made (that would be A&A Classic in my opinion), but it's still good and against all other classics: Conquest of the empire (broken), A&A Classic (made obsolete) and Fortress America (flawed) it can still withstand the test of time!

03-05-2008 We played my Victory Point variant the other day, and it works like a charm. The game accumulates to a climax after (only) 5 3/4 hours. The tention that someone could win was always there as soon as we all got experience 2-3 for our Daymio. I upgraded my rating to an 8 and will continue with this variant, since one of its best advantages is that it does create an ending to the game, and rewards offensive play, rather then turtling.

Truly the standard, the high benchmark, among all the cut-throat style, muilti-player, light warfare, strategy board games.  I have played this game no less than 30 times and I never grow tired of it.  To be "socially playable" though with adults, this game needs a VP house mod so that it's no longer a "Last-Man-Standing" style game; LMS just isn't suitable for adults any longer.  Still love this game, but it is "humbled" in comparison to the ultimate AT cut-throat game...TI3-SE-SotT!

[4 plays] A cool game, but too easily becomes a "beat-up on the leader" game towards the end. Also vulnerable to some chaotic swings at the end as armies get crazy powerful. Unlucky random set-up at the beginning can really hamstring a player.

Several of the mechanics here are clever and were quite innovative for their day. This game can take a VERY long time to play, but good fun if everyone is prepared for that.

Basically its a good game, but its too long, too convoluted, too chaotic. The main problem lies with the way that troop movement is near impossible to keep track of and that competent gameplay would require extremely AP behaviour.
With three players it has the usual problems of Risk-like games, which are king-making and possibly extremely unbalanced starting positions. It might be better with 4 or 5 players, but would very likely take much longer that I would care for.

A tense and constantly changing game. The generals' growth in experience eliminates endgame problems such as those that you run into in Risk, and the game gets fast and tense in the endgame because the Generals can make multiple attacks.  There is an actual feeling of growth of a military power base.  The best of the gamemaster series -- many more options than Axis and Allies, and without the tactical rule problems of Conquest of the Empire.
But still has the one weakness of the Gamemaster games -- it's a game that may take four hours, and players can be eliminated from the game early...

I own the classic Gamemaster version where it was called Shogun.  After Survive, it is my favorite game that predates the mid 1990s.  Very innovative and modern.  Its only draw backs from a modern perspective are that there is too much downtime and that in the 4 and 5 player games, you can be hosed by your position on the map.

I've played many games of it, over almost 30 years and I see something new in it every time I play.

RATING: 8
Ah, Shogun!  THIS is THE game that is solely responsible for my current obsession with board games - it is the very fond memories I have of playing this game as a child with my family that prompted me to begin searching for a similar gaming experience several years ago, thereby leading me down the proverbial rabbit hole.  I'm not sure if I can put all the nostalgia aside, but I'll try to approach this mini review as objectively as possible!  Essentially, this is a very straight-forward "build an army, bash your neighbour, and grab their territory" affair, with some interesting elements in the form of a ninja (that's right, there's a ninja!!) and secret allocation of resources, thrown in.  The game is quite easy to learn, with the only confusing rules being those that involve the movement of armies and the way in which they pick up and drop off soldiers.  It's main drawback is its length, and this is easy to correct by adjusting the victory conditions (I use a victory point system - 1VP per province, 1VP per castle, 2VPs per fortress, 3VPs per enemy Diamyo eliminated - and the winning player is the one with the most points when a player is eliminated or a time limit is reached, whichever comes first).  From a physical component standpoint, there are basically 2 extremes.  The plastic figures and swords and the foam trays kick ass, while the board, province cards, and player reference screens are dull but functional.  This game, while old, was ground-breaking for it's genre and has certainly held up over time.  Other games, such as "Attack! Deluxe" and "Conquest of the Empire II" have many more interesting elements going on, but for a simple, "bash your neighbour" game of conquest, you can't go wrong with this one.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

I used to play this at the Fleet Lounge in Yokosuka back in my Navy days. It's a lot like Risk, but deeper. I'd love to get my hands on a copy, but it's more expensive than I can justify given how little often it's likely to hit the table in my game group. 
Edit: I can hardly believe it even though I hold the pieces in my hand. An old Navy Buddy sold me a copy at "friend pricing" :) There are a significant number of pieces missing, but I made some tokens. Who wants to play?

Oh, how to express my joy for this game... Easily my favourite of the wargames, and likely of all games. The strategy takes on so many levels, from micromanagement of individual armies, to social management and how to play two opponents off each other, to grandsweeping plans that take many rounds to the full game to pull off. The analysis paralysis that occurs when someone accidentally puts something important within reach, like a weakened army or poorly defended temple, or the depth of troop movement at the end of your turn. There are players, talented players and pure magicians. It's a long game, but I thoroughly enjoy every single minute of it. Now if I could only convince more people to play. I think it may be responsible in part to me being married to my wife.

What a great game. I don't think it's too long, because it's so damn tense. Because there's no natural border for you to get comfortable with,(like Risk), it's always very edgy - especially with the full 5P, and once one player goes down and his provinces are added to his conquerer's it beccomes a slippery slope. Just seen the great looking cards variant - can't wait to try that!!!

I played this for the first time in 2010, nearly 25 years after the game was published. I think Samurai Swords has actually held up pretty well. If not for the fact that it has player elimination and is a tad long for what it is, I'd probably want this in my collection. The production values (as with all the Gamemaster series) are fantastic, and the game play actually leaves room for some interesting stragtegic and tactical decisions in between all the luck of the dice rolls. Sadly, while this remains a pretty good game, there are now a number of great longer games that I suspect will keep me from revisiting Samurai Swords anytime in the near future.

I like this game even though there's a fair bit of randomness to it. Although the random set up is works in its favour. It makes for a different game each time you play.
I'd still rather play Axis & Allies over this one even though the set up is the same for every game. I just prefer the WWII theme.

This is great game. How does it compare to the previous editions? It has the best ruleook. Components are of great quality. There are no swords in the new version (it is a shame)! The colors of the the different armies are not functional (the red is too close to the brown and the other colors are pastel). Verdict: Buy but keep the previous versions so you can mix and match the best parts!

[thing=221][/thing] is a game from 1986, and in some points it shows its age: the goal of the game is to conquer X territories, or to eliminate someone. But without a set number of rounds, these tasks can take a while to happen, [i]if ever[/i]! So [thing=221][/thing] can last for quite while, with no signs of ending. There is also no catch-up mechanism - on the contraty: on the vein of [thing=181][/thing], the less territories someone has, the less money she will have to invest, meaning that, is harder to catch with the others (so one may enter in a spiral of bad things) - and this is probably made so that some players in a vicious circle in order to be eliminated, or to keep losing territories, in order for the game to end. Not the best idea of design, but one more often seen in older games. Ando also there is plenty of luck present: all the combats are dice-based, and the best units - the bowmen - only have 50% of hitting, and the most common and cheap - the spearmen - have 1/3 (4 in 12) chance of hitting; the only way to up the odds in your favor is to have more units, and still won't be guaranteed.

Still, even with these problems/quirks, [thing=221][/thing] has some nice things: the board, full of troops, looks great. And the choice of how spend the money is clever: everyone has a planning trays with screens and behind it players will decide, at the start of every round, where to invest their hard earn koku (money), and there are six possibilities: turn order, build, levy units, hire ronin and hire ninja. Turn order seemed tricky to us, as play in last (or second, or third) has several advantages, specially last, as your moves aren't answered, so everything you take, will remain yours for that round. Sure, being first also has its perks, as is possible to attack first, before someone moves, and if someone reaches the X number of territories, the game ends immediately. Most of the time, though, playing last will be better. Ronins fight for you in the round, but leave in the end of it, and players can hide in which place they are. The Ninja can kill Daimyos, preventing an army from moving, if his attack is successful - but a new Daimyo will rise from among the units to lead the army by the end of the round, so, to truly kill an Daimyo, is necessarry to destroy the whole army; however, only the faction that pays the most for his services will take the Ninja.

Anyway, in the game, after planning, building (castles and fortification, which help defend territories), recruit units and hiring ronin and/or the ninja, comes the most important part: the movement and battles. First, the player can move he armies - everyone starts with 3, and the more experience the Daimyo has (by winning battles), more the army can move. After, the player declares all the moves he will make that will lead to battles. In the battle, the bowmen (6 out of 12) and the gunners (4/12) attack first, and the casualties they do are taken out before the infantry can attack. After the ranged attacks, the Daimyo attacks (6/12), than the ronin (5/12) and swordsmen (5/12), and finally, the spearmen (4/12), and only after all of them attacked the casualties will be applied (so, say, you did 3 hits with your swordsmen against 2 spearmen, these will still be able to attack, then, afterwards, they will be removed). After all the battles, come the final movement - and only in this moment can normal armies (without being lead by Daimyos) can enter in empty territories; the army, even if it moved before, can still move again in this phase. Finally, after all the battles of everyone, players will receive koku (money) is the basis of 1 for each 3 territories they have under control.

Another issue of the game is downtime - the more players, the bigger it will be, as in the movement/battle phase, the player makes all his movement and battles, before the next player's turn. This is lessened a bit because if someone is battling you, you will play. However, there can be (and will) turns in which the player will start 5, 6 wars, and maybe only one against you. And the battles, especially among armies, can last for a good while, as the units can miss a lot. Since I played in with 2 others, usually the player whose turn was up did battles against the other and I, and, still, there were times were I wasn't attacked more than once, be because my weak positions were too far from the player, or because of we did a deal. So, be ready to wait - I will add that I like to see what others are doing and cheer in the battles, even if I'm not involved, therefore the downtime doesn't bothered me, but I need to mention.

The bits of the game are really good - the art is great and is easy to teall the units apart, however, between players, they only differ in color, there are no unique miniatures for each faction. The planing trays are neat and work well.

There is a good deal of strategy and timming in [thing=221][/thing]. When to press on, when to retreat, when to take and when to leave. The armies are the key part in the game, as they can concentrate troops (up to 15 units) way more than in the territories (up to 5) - usually the armies pass crushing everyone in their path, but everytime they advance, if the player wants to claim the territory just won, it is necessary to leave an unit behind, which makes the army weaker - and if a player isn't careful careful with this, she might just see herself being attacked by the (stronger) army of someone else. Also, combinated movement can achieve some major feats - by war of attrition, even an army can be defeated, if it finds itself surrounded by several small battalions. And, of course, using the Ninja, to lock an army in a place, can have huge consequences. It is also nice that the armies can be customized by the players - one might have more bowmen and gunners, concentrating in ranged attacks and killing first, while other might carry lots of cheap spearmen, in order to be able to conquer several places without leaving costly units behind.

Therefore, in the middle of its rough parts, there is a juicy game, with lots of back and forth. It is also positive that, simply by considering the amount of territories one must conquer, turtling isn't really a thing - it is nice to have a well protected area, sure, and probably one territory with some units and a castle won't be targeted as much, but once someone decides to come crashing down with an army, the probabilities will be on their side, and the attacking player will most likely end up with a free castle.

Overall, [thing=221][/thing] shows its age. The rounds start to feel same-y, with taking and losing territories. The real emotion will come when an army fights another, but, considering the dire consequences of completely losing an army, and the knowledge that, once the fight is over, someone might come to beat the weary winner. The duration of the game is hard to guess, as if everyone is watchful and playing well, it can last much more - but one or two mistakes in the movement, or some fights that went wrong, can mean a turn in the flow of the game, with one or more players russhing to fight to the bitter end. Is important to add that eliminating one player is a trigger for the end of the game only in the "quick" scenario, which, after playing, is my recommendation. So [thing=221][/thing] isn't a game I will be wanting to play in most occasions, as the demand of time, and the repetition of move-battle-gain-lose without really advancing the game to its end, takes its toll. But there is enough to [thing=221][/thing] to make it a good option every now and then.

hogun / Samurai Swords / Ikusa is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.

This is a good and interesting game.  It doesn't get to the table much, because it takes 3  hours to play.  In fact, I have not played it in at least 10 years.  My wife keeps trying to give it away, and I keep putting it back into the game closet.

For Christmas 2007, I gave this to my 12 year old nephew in a hopes of giving it new life and creating a new generation of gamers.  Hope it fares well.

As of July 2008, my nephew has not yet played the game. The long rule book overwhelmed him.  I'll need to teach him to play the next time I visit.

Best war game out there.  Hands down.  No card driven war game here; just dice, strategy, and battle.  Fluid game play and lots of options for strategy and brinksmanship.  There are troops with lots of possibilities and dice rolling battles so prepare to possibly loose.  Random set up in the beginning so no two games are the same.  This is a true war game where you make the best out of what you've got and who out of your fellow players you can scheme with.  Vicious with no quarter given.  This is a game for those who love uniqueness of war games and not static scenarios that you can play out every game.  When you draw your sword you better be prepared to use it!  The game ends the moment one person has occupied 35 Japanese medieval provinces so make your turn wisely and be prepared to risk it all on dime if the odds are in your favour.  Be forewarned though that it can be a long game, so set aside an entire night or afternoon (4-6hrs average).

RATING: 7
I have The Samurai Swords edition, not Shogun nor the new Ikusa version.  

Basically the game is Risk, but on Japanese-themed mega-steroids.  Incredibly nice production values make this game look gorgeous, with armies full of samurai and peasant spearmen and riflemen all going at it across the whole of Japan.  From sneak attacks by mercenaries (ronin) to assassination attempts by ninja, Samurai Swords has plenty of opportunities for conquest, plotting, and back-stabbings galore.  Your generals even get better over time as they successfully campaign across the Japanese countryside.

My only problem with it is that, despite all its strategic complications and advancements in game mechanics, the gameplay itself still feels like a newer, souped up version of Risk itself.  Certainly fun to play now and then (and infinitely more fun than oh so bland original Risk), but still a game that I only play once in a while, when the right mood hits.

Now this was first serious war game to buy after play many games of Risk, but unfortunately, I couldn't get my friends to play after 2 times. They are prefer less complex rules and gameplay. Now I have other friends that only play eurostyle games, so this great game is just collecting dust. I like how you have armies and individual units to control and build, the use of an assassin, bidding for first turns and the design. But I wish there was more of a dice modifying part to it. This game isn't easy to learn for most and if you have friends that prefer ameritrash then it's worth a try.

As a multi-player territory and conquest game, Samurai Swords adds lots to improve on its basic Risk-like game engine. There's lots of cool units, control, supply, and planning to consider.

One of several games from the 8o's that takes Risk-like mechanics and takes it up several large notches. This one is great! The components are fantastic and the rule book is nicely formatted with clear, illustrated examples.

Bought this not long after A&A.  Really liked it, esp. the quick changes that can occur with a seasoned Daimyo rampaging through multiple territories, or with a nasty assasination.

I like this Gamemaster game since I could actually compete with my brother, unlike Axis and Allies.  I wish my box was in better shape than it is.  Played this a few times in University and maybe once after graduation.  Kept around for old time sake.

Like Axis & Allies, I still have my original game.  Probably with some missing pieces, but it's there.  The secret bidding was a neat concept.

RATING: 8
Such fantastic memories playing some epic games.  It sort of felt like a combination of diplomacy and axis and allies.  Played it again recently and it was still great. Bought the newest version, and let me tell you, those player colours are horrible.  In poor lighting, you can't tell three of them apart.  It actually took away from the game because I can't see who is who so the strategy really suffers.

RATING: 5
Fun with the right people.

And by that, I mean fun with dead people.  Because in a session where everyone but you has rigor mortis there's no downtime, you can eat everyone's snacks, and kingmaking is a remote possibility at best.

The best of the MB GameMaster series. The random set up solves the programmed play issue of Axis and Allies.

One of my first games. Lots of fun. Many wars fought on this one. Great components for its time. An ageless game which is still fun to play after all of these years. Play with people who do not take war and betrayal personally.

A much better wargame then Risk. more strategy, more different units, more different actions. To sum it all up: 5 different units, hirelings, ninja spy/assassins, hidden income allocation, forts and castles, main army experience.

Found this in a small curio shop for 15 bucks. It was still in the shrinkwrap! 
The shop owner had bought it in an estate sale and had no idea what it was. So he just threw a price tag on it and put it on a shelf.

This is a great game, but be prepared to spend several hours or more. Beware the ninja...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It has a NINJA! (Josh - you CAN spend your koku on other things ya know) And the NINJA! can actually affect the outcome of major battles.  Beautiful if long game (I still remember how upset my mother was with my father when he spent his entire day off from work learning and playing this with me) It gives a good feel of battles in Shogunate Japan.  Actually plays out in very few turns... they just take a good deal of time to play out.  Beautiful pieces.  And again... NINJA!

UPDATE:
Well, like so many things from our childhoods... the memories are better than the reality.  Its not you Ikusa/SamuraiSwords/Shogun...its me.  I've changed.  We've grown apart I guess.  And now you just seem like an overwrought, repetitive, and somewhat boring game of risk.  With a NINJA!

Great 3 player dynamic gameplay, 4 and 5 player games tend to see one person pushed out within a few rounds, and 2 player games take ages as you control 2 armies each. I would recommend this as a good 3 player game.

Tested in a group of four (just one experienced player). Long breaks duringt the battle-movement turns which are pretty boring if you are not involved!

Who will Yosh decide needs to leave the game?  He will pick someone and destroy them, and himself in the process.  

This is a decent MB war-game, but there are many better ones out there now, and if you want to devote several hours to a game you should play one of them.

RATING: 6
Best of the Ameritrash I've played.

I like its basic army/occupying-force distinction---it's the "fuedal" part of the theme, but also adds a substantial dimension not in A&A, Risk, et. al.  More balanced and less scripted than A&A.  The combat resolution is sensible.  Room for interesting strategy.

However, four hours is long for this particular depth and frequency of dice shaking.  Try "History of the World", or the minion other modern territory conquest games that can be played in less than 5 hours.

My No.2 GAMEMASTER game behind Axis & Allies.  I love the ability of an army/daimyo to gain experience and speed by winning battles.  Tons of fun cutting a swath of destruction through enemy territory with a highly succesful army.

Generally speaking, "everyone for themselves" war games don't work for me. Early losers sit around for hours waiting for the game to finish. Otherwise, Shogun is a well designed and high quality game.

A great aspect to this game is that player's generals are rewarded for combat(through combat experience), so sandbagging while your opponents chip away at each other, weakening each other, is a strategy that wont work.

One of my early favorites.  
The worse part is the inevitable, &quot;if you kill me, I will throw the game in another player&#039;s favor&quot;
I like the Daimyo aspect, as well as the koku allocation.  there are some interesting variant rules that can be done.

After 1 Play: I tend not to like these multiplayer wargames, as I feel some players are at a huge disadvantage just by being next to the more aggressive players.  I also tend not to like this much luck in a game I expect to take 4+ hours.  I'm willing to overlook these flaws if a game is fun enough, but this one isn't, so I'm not.

Not sure why I like this less than A&A or Fortress America.  I think it may be the lack of cool units, or maybe the theme.  It certainly has the most player interaction of any of the the GM games.  Can become an exercise in frustration, but probably no more so than A&A.  Probably would be the game of choice for anyone looking to play the GM series today, however, it's just not my thing.

RATING: 8
Risk, on steroids with elements of Axis and Allies.  It's hard to describe how much your 3 main armies change the overall strategy compared to Risk, but it does and makes it a more complete game and making multiple units with varying degrees of attack and defense creates depth.  Watch out for the guy hunkering in the corner with the appearance of being down and out, until you are eliminated completely everyone has a chance.  This game is best with 5 players, but any mix is fun and challenging.

A press your luck game of dice. Get as much brains as possible and stop before being hit 3 times. You pick the dices randomly and the color of the dices gives an indication of the probability of getting Brains or Hits. Green dices are good, Red dices are bad...

-1 A bit too simplistic...
-2 Good, quick time-killer, but after a few games you're ready to play something else...

Good memories but if I do PYL with dice, I go back to the granddaddy, Can't Stop.

130929 I really do enjoy the simplicity of this game.  Maybe too light to be a regular, but this is a good little game.  I should keep this in my game bag.

120102 simple PYL game.  get brains before you get shotgun blasted.  I like the fact you still have a chance on your last turn no matter how badly you are doing (theoretically).  Can't stop is a thinking man's PYL game, this is just a simple fun stupid (but not too stupid) PYL game.

A simple push-your-luck game. I have played it many times because someone I play with loves it. Personally, I find it all random chance and no real strategy, but it does work very well as a filler and is easy to learn for absolutely everyone. Plus, everyone loves dice.

9/20 - Updating rating up to 7. I've grown to appreciate how unpretentious a push-your-luck game this is. It plays super-fast, does not try to be more than it is, and is incredibly easy to teach. After playing many push-your-luck games that pretend to be strategy games and run far too long, I always find myself coming back to the simplicity of zombie dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A great filler game when you have less then 30 min to kill

Pretty much a what-you'd-expect press-your-luck dice game.  There are three types of dice, but that is really what makes this "1" better than others.  Well, that and the theme.  I'll be buying my own copy.

+ Cool-looking dice; Fun theme.
- There's really not a game in here; It's more of an activity really.


Why it's previously-owned:

I slipped this into my friend's box of games at Christmas.  I'm sure he's thrilled.

In Zombie Dice, you are a zombie. You want braaains – more brains than any of your zombie buddies. The 13 custom dice are your victims. Push your luck to eat their brains, but stop rolling before the shotgun blasts end your turn! Whoever collects 13 brains first wins. Each game takes 10 to 20 minutes and can be taught in a single round.

Zombie dice will rarely see any playtime with my game group, but I do recommend it for lunch and party situations. 
It is a super portable, quick/fun/painless, "press your luck", party filler.
The only skill required is the ability to gauge probability. The theme is goofy and easy to sell with non-gamers.

RATING: 5
Farkle isn't as much fun for me since I stopped drinking. Zombie Dice has fixed that by making me feel drunk.

This is one of the few games I can easily get my girlfriend to play. Our daughter likes this a lot too. It seems the best way for me to bridge the gender gap is with zombies. I like that we're all trying to figure the odds. I'm hoping this game is the gateway.

EDIT: I changed my rating from an 8 to a 5. I have far more games in my collection than gamers to play. They are either unplayed or barely played. Zombie Dice is asked for by name by people at work. I've played this game numerous times with different people. It hasn't turned out to be a gateway game, though. Maybe the crowd will ask for something else when they become as sick of Zombie Dice as I am. A typical game involves a lucky early huge lead. Then, the rest have no choice but to roll until they win or lose. People like the feel and sound of dice. People like the idea of psychic control and weird meaningful coincidences appearing as fate. The game is a religious experience. However, I'm not religious.

No-brain filler.
We use all 3 extra dice from the expansion and a variant (overkill): If you have 3 shots in one roll, you lose half of your score!

Longest winning streak witnessed: 15 brains on turn 1!

I like dice games.  I like zombie themed games.  So I like zombie dice.  It's pretty much straight chance so don't bother if you must have your fate be decided by your own skill.  The great thing about games like this is that the number of players really doesn't change the game at all.  You can play with 2 people or 20.  It's super easy to explain, it comes in a small container so you can take anywhere, and it doesn't require much thought.  Sometimes you need a game like that.  Also, who doesn't like eating brains?

I'd like to note here that I like Martian Dice slightly more because it seems like you have more choices to make with your chance rolls.  But overall, it's the same experience.

I bought this one after reading the rules, as a filler game it may remove Tsuro as the go between palette cleanser! I like the look, the implementation and so far the rules! I have only shaken it out solo "lite" to look into some permutations and work on a little strategy, but this one will most certainly get busted out really soon!

Will rate proper after a game or two!

Played, and have played several times since then, it is asked for now, and yes it has proven itself in the "in between" role, and has even helped to headline when all we wanted on tap were "light" fillers, now that I own several! This is a fun little lively game that can get a group to loosen up and make silly noises and sounds and have a good time. The die keep it fun for newbs, and hopefully keeps the "pros" among you lighthearted. solid title, will have to invest in some longevity "pimping" of some sort those die see a LOT of rolling!

I'm always on the lookout for new push-your-luck games, because that is one of my family's favorite mechanisms. I've been reading about this one for a long time, and it seemed like a good investment, so I made a point of buying it in a geeklist auction. It is indeed an effective game for my family because the rules are straightforward, and it has a fair amount of those surprise moments when someone gets the unexpected roll of 3 brains or 3 gunshots. On the one hand I'm very glad that the game only plays until someone has 13 points, because these kind of games need to be fast and furious. However, on the other hand, with such a small goal it is easy for a player with a single lucky round to gain such an advantage that the victory is virtually out of reach for the other players. And it feels like that really good round is very hard to achieve and there is no way to directly affect your odds, so it's all about who hits that one magic turn. Still the game is decent fun, and doesn't outstay its welcome, so who really cares if I feel like I have no shot at winning for half the game. It's a solid dice filler, and might take some of the load away from Mmm ... Brains! which was our previous end-of-night game.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I thought there would be more "push your luck" decisions, however its always pretty obvious when you should go again and stop.  I don't mind the crazy lucky rolls (or horrible unlucky), since I get what type of game this is, but just was kind of hoping for those tough "Can't Stop" like push your luck decisions.

An okay press-your-luck filler game.  The rules are simple, and it can fit in your pocket (think: restaurants, bars, parties, etc.).  Although the game is simple, it's not an entirely brainless exercise like LCR.  The game has light strategy (tactics) and press-your-luck elements.  As one reviewer stated, it has just enough risk to make it fun.

Terrible game for me.  I fully understand the press your luck element, I get the idea, but I still don't like it.  It ends up being a solitaire game where you cannot even participate until everybody else finishes their turn.  You have to listen to the extremely loud shaking of dice and hear people trying to strategize about a random roll.  You have to hear the cursing for a bad roll or the almost equally annoying patting on the back words for good rolls that the person had no control over.

I want to have a good say in what the ultimate results of my gameplay entails.  A purely dice based game removes that and turns into 95% randomize and 5% thought.  Way too much.

Finally, why not sell this game with a hundred dice or so, making it so everybody plays simultaneously instead of having to wait for other people?

Zombie dice is a very basic push your luck game, but it can be played in just a matter of minutes depending on how many players you have. 

The game is entirely based on dice, so you have limited ability to plan your victory. You could always figure probabilities based on dice remaining, but really I just find it more fun to just roll until you feel uncomfortable.  

Overall zombie dice is a quick and easy game that could not be easier to play. My wife and I have had a great time playing it and I am sure all of our friends will too!It's lack of complexity is what's good about it, but also what keeps it from being a great game.

RATING: 4
Pure "push your luck" game. It's a very short filler, probably one of the shortest games out there, and it isn't meant to be taken too seriously I think. Therefore I just keep on rolling the dice until I eventually fail... As it's almost solely pure luck, I cannot really give it a higher rating, but a 5 is a good rating considering what the game actually has to offer.

This is overall just a fun game to have as a part of your collection.

Push your luck dice game. Only 13 dice meaning it travels easily. You try and roll as many brains as you can before rolling three shotgun blasts. There are easy, medium, and hard dice which adds a small amount of complexity - doesn't prevent it from feeling entirely luck driven though.

This game has a number of free fan made expansions/variants. At some point I will PnP these and include them here. If any of them are particularly entertaining I will update my review score.

Great mindless fun. I always play with my 'Triple Whammy' variant which means rolling three shotguns at once wipes ALL brains gained so far. Harsh, but an extra layer of risk which I find works quite well - also means anyone near 13 isn't guaranteed a win :p

Underestimated the fun in this push your luck game.  A lot of  fun with Zombie Dice 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A 'push your luck' style game. Players play as zombies while the dice represent their human victims. 3 different colored dice represent different levels of difficulty. Green dice represent easy prey, has more brains and feet sides and less shotguns, yellow are medium with less brains, more feet and shotguns, while red represent hard dice and have more shotguns, less feet and even less brains.

Players will take their turns separately, taking three dice from the cup at a time, roll them and decide what to do based on the results. Any brains rolled the player sets aside. Any shotgun blasts they also set aside. Any feet they roll, they must reroll if they decide to push their luck. If they push their luck, they draw more dice from the cup to equal three (draw none if all three rolled happen to be feet) and roll again. The player may keep going until they decide to stop or until they roll 3 shotgun blasts in total. If they stop on their own before rolling 3 shotguns, they keep tally of how many brains they rolled. If they get 3 shotguns, they score zero points and pass the cup to the next player.

Play resumes until a player has scored 13 points. Once a player does, every other player gets one final round to try to even the score or surpass that player. If no one can, that player wins. 

It's a very simple game. But like many games I describe as simple, they are quick to play, feel fun and don't wear out their welcome. A nice quickie game or one that isn't too intensive while drinking or perhaps in a distraction filled setting as it doesn't require too much attention from other players in between turns. Also, it's super inexpensive. A fun little addition.

Is this for real? I can't believe anyone decided to publish this. I'm even more shocked that anyone would buy it. I have a special disdain for the fact that not only are the dice already random enough, but you have to select [i]which[/i] dice to roll at random. And the tube that the game comes with is terrible for this, since it's narrow enough that the dice put in last generally come out first. Other appealing to Zombiephiles or people who can't store more than 3 sentences of rules in their brains, games like [thing=15818][/thing] or [thing=37400][/thing] are infinitely better.

If you're immortal, you might like this game!  You have lots of time to kill, and this is absolutely a time killing exercise with no strategy, no theme, and only marginal amounts of fun.  Like, it's not horrible like a zombie actually eating your brain, but it's only as much fun as shooting a zombie with a shotgun and slowly realizing that Oh My God that was Jake that worked the counter at ACE Hardware, Oh God Jake, No, Why?

Zombie dice somehow manages to be extremely simple, but really fun. The game is pure push your luck, but players don't just win by getting lucky. If you push your luck too much or don't push it enough then you will lose. This game is a great dice game that will always cause fun and laughter.

Among the purest of dice games as it is just a press your luck dice game. That said, one press your luck dice game is just as good as the next, and it won't see much play besides a filler or quickie between meatier games. Still, the basic formula is enjoyable the zombie theme is as well executed as it could be here. The bonus though, is you actually are the zombie. Style points for that right there.

Want to pass the time with some very quick dice-rolling?  This is a great one for that exact purpose, and the expansions add just a little bit of extra flavor, though don't go expecting a lot of depth. Push-your-luck at its basest (which is not a bad thing).

RATING: 7
A fun, lightweight, push-your-luck dice rolling game. You can play a round in five to ten minutes so it's a great little filler game. The entire  game comes in a neat little tube (that doubles as a dice shaker, although I'm not sure how long it would stand up to that level of punishment). 

The components are really just a number of dice and a single sheet of rules, but the dice are a good size and are bright and easy to read. I found it adds a lot to the game to use the plastic brains from the game "Mmm... Brains!" as score tokens (there's plenty of room for these in the game tube, plus room for a dice bag if you don't want to use the tube for shaking/randomising your dice picks).

An OK dice game that's fun if you're waiting around somewhere or something.  Scratches that "push your luck" itch, but not much else.

I feel like this game has completed its life in our collection. We mainly use it as a stupid time filler to keep our hands busy while talking about other topics. There isn't anything in terms of strategy to speak of other than knowing the distribution of dice in the cup. It's now just an average game.

Awesome, simple dice-rolling game. Always a fun time.  We always use the little Santa die expansion and sometimes the Hunk and Hotty one.  We also include an extra house rule - if you roll 3 different colors and 3 different symbols in a single roll, you get a bonus "Moose point" (our friend named Moose habitually rolls that combo so it became part of our game). Possibly the most played game we have, mainly due to time length and ease of play.

There is not a lot going on in this game. It's pretty easy to figure out what you should do if you know the distribution of the three types of dice and their sides.

Ultra simple and compact push your luck die rolling game.  Players draw 3 dice blindly from the cup and roll them.  Dice come in three colours - red (tough), yellow (semi-tough) and gree (easy).  Players are trying to roll brains and avoid shotgun blasts.  Both of these results are "banked", and more dice are drawn and rolled again.  Players can opt out and bank their brains after a roll, but three blasts means you're done - no brains for you!  First to 13 brains ends the game, highest brains wins.  Harmless fluff, nice dice, compact storage, plays itself.

Quick and simple push-your-luck dice rolling game.   It's almost a novelty item.   There is one cool idea here:  green dice are easier to score points with, yellow dice somewhere in the middle, and red dice are hard to score points with.   Roll 3 shotgun blasts and loose all the points you've earned.   I'd rather play this than Zonkers or 10,000.

2015-02-22 : It's a dice game - I like Martian Dice just a little better, but this is a fine filler as well
2016-04-03 : figured out why I like Martian Dice better : in that game you're making an additional decision what to do with what your rolled, whereas with Zombie Dice it's pure rolling.
2016-11-12 : really need to play our next game with the expansion stuff as basic Zombie dice is starting to get really old. Lowering the score to 4, maybe the expansions can save it.

RATING: 8
Zombie Dice is the perfect pallet cleanser of a game. you have just finished a night of board gaming or you are coming to the end of the night with friends. you want to play something that doesn't rely on too many rules, game pieces and concentration. you can just pass this around while everyone is enjoying a drink and a chat. the premise is simple. Roll 3 dice try to collect Brains and avoid being shot. get shot 3 times and you lose the points for that round. The first player to reach 13 initiates the last round and then the player with the most brains wins. my only complaint is that the dice and plastic of the container can be quite loud and would have been nice if there was some kind of lining in the pot to dampen the noise. there are a number of expansions for ZD however as I mentioned above I treat this game more as a quick distraction rather than an in depth game. the expansions mean that more concentration is required which I actually think detracts from the brilliance of this game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has a collection of games and use this at the end of the evening or as something to take down to the pub.

An excellent super light filler. It scales well up to about 5 or 6 players, any more and there would be too much down time. The dice are good quality, but the tube is too thin to fit your hand into and the plastic ends make a horrible sound when you shake the dice. I use a dice bag instead, much better.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A pretty standard push-your-luck dice game with a half-way decent zombie theme. The different difficulty of dice adds a little bit of interest, but on the whole this is an ironically brainless game. I prefer this to [GAMEID=2593], mainly because I can't see my relatives ever asking to play this. Unfortunately, they still ask to play [GAMEID=2593].

A perfect dice filler, especially with casual non-gamers. With an unlimited number of players, works great playing at a bar with a bunch of folks.

Pairs well with Martian Dice--two games that are quite similar, but different enough to merit owning both.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple fun.  Anyone can pick up and enjoy Zombie Dice, regardless of their previous gaming experience.  Great for when you have a few minutes to kill, such as between commercial breaks.  The dice are good-looking, the theme is fun but not pervasive enough to scare away squeamish folk, and it's fairly cheap.  It's more strategic than it first appears, and boils down to betting against how many of the dangerous reds and yellows are left in the dice cup.

That said, the game is essentially just rolling dice.  It's not even so complex as Yahtzee.  It's so light and short, in fact, that it's almost not worth going through the trouble of digging out of the closet.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 5
A fine dice rolling game. It's slightly awkward to get the dice out of the cup, but not a major complaint.
It seems best with about 3 players, any more and it becomes too much of a wait until your next shot. 2 Players is fine too, but maybe a little too quick.

It sounds like I am judging this game on simply the speed of the play. I'm not, its just little niggles. It is a game similar to Fluxx, in so far as there is a time window in which this game excels. Any longer and it starts to outstay it's welcome.

I'm always interested when someone does a variant on Yahtzee.  This game is ok but got totally ruined for me at WinterCon one year.  It's now a nickname we use for one of the players at the table who couldn't grasp the rule that you don't put the dice back.  Also, Zombies are such a worn out theme.

If Cthulhu Dice is LCR: The Steve Jackson Games Edition, then Zombie Dice is Can't Stop!: The SJG Edition.  I love a good game of Can't Stop! every now and again, and Zombie Dice fills that niche as well.  The game is made even better if you use a house rule that says you must hold all your conversations using the word "Brains!" only while playing.

RATING: 7
I'm conflicted whether this game deserves a 7. It's a simple, mindless game that doesn't aspire to be anything more, and it accomplishes that well. 

There are lots of "push your luck" type games, but this is probably my favorite. A fun theme, and the colored dice mechanic where some dice are more favorable to the player than others (randomly selected, and you're stuck with them once you have them) adds a minor level of strategy. 

In short it's nice as a warm-up, palette cleanser, or "my God I've had enough drinks I can't handle anything more complicated" game. If you're looking for anything with significant strategy or complexity you'll be disappointed. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Strikes a nice balance between simplicity and fun, and the variety of dice (red/green/yellow) keeps the turns from being too similar.  Rating reflects how it doesn't overstay its welcome relative to its fun.

This is a very quick, entertaining luck game. 

  Very easy to learn and play.  

It takes a minimum of 30 sec and a maximum 10 min to play. 

  You do not need use any brain capacity. It is not a serious game.  

It's a perfect in-between of bigger game that exhaust your brain, or when you are too tired/drunk to think. 

  There is a tiny little bit of 'strategie' involve. The classic : go for more, but risk losing everything. 

Fun game to play with kids, providing they are pass the 'eating dice' stage. They shall learn about the greed of human nature, but not much else.  

  A neat, and cheap, little game.  7.5

The more players the more down time.  Better with fewer players.  Similar to Can't Stop.

If more than 3-4 players I think everyone should have their own dice and everyone rolls the round at the same time.  Everyone either stops or blasts out before proceeding to the next round.  I just don't like watching others play--with strategy games you can be thinking about your next move--but this is primarily a game of luck.

And yes, my dice-loving daughter loves this one.  No doubt I will get sick, sick, sick of it.

Nothing special, but a nice simple diversion - and the free iPhone game is also a nice touch (Rating 6, 2/4/11). UPDATE: Actually, this game is holding and actually improving its worth.  When compared to some recent kickstarter rubbish and other dice games (Im looking at you Battleship Express), this is quite a quick enjoyable dice rolling diversion with theme. You actually feel you are making meaningful decisions rather than just watching, and the regular chance to say ‘Braaaiinns’ and make shotgun noises is a fun bonus that adds to the game. Deserves an increase rating to 7 (Dec 14). UPDATE: Its becoming less fun again (Feb 15, Rating 6.213).

Have extra used copy for trade (including the Double Feature expansion); it's in good condition, the dice are perfect, the instructions sheets are somewhat crumpled up but usable. From an email discussion: "Definitely not meaty at all, but I love Zombie Dice as an 'appetizer' game which you can play with any number of people, perfect for waiting for folks to show up especially with a group of non gamers who just want to have some simple fun. The spectatorship and cheering/jeering element of pushing folks to go one more roll can really make it memorable. And the expansion really does work nicely."

Fun and light filler/drinking game. You can take it anywhere and play in just a few minutes. I'd recommend putting them in a dice bag as the cardboard tube can be flimsy. I have since upgraded to the deluxe version with the plastic screw top. I highly recommend going this route if buying new, or just using a dice bag if you already have the standard edition.

Great little filler game.  Roll dice and collect the most "brains" before you get a shotgun to the face.  Zombie dice is a re-imagining of an old game I used to play as a kid (I believe we called it the game of 10000) but the cool theme and simplified rules of ZD make it better than the original.  Quick to learn,  ready to play and good fun to see your mates press their luck too far and lose it all!

Its' simplicity is its strength. I don't think it's a "good game", but anything that lets me and my kids sit around rolling dice together for 30 minutes has got to be worth the purchase price.

Unimpressed.  Theoretically, this is a light press-your-luck game about rolling dice with brains (points) on some sides and shotgun blasts (three of which nullify the brains and end your turn) on other sides.  This already doesn't sound too promising, but in the game we played, we rolled so many dice that rolling a shotgun blast on your first or perhaps your second roll was nearly inevitable, causing the game to last much too long, maybe forever.

It's a push your luck game with zombies and shotgun blasts. The first person to eat 13 brains...WINS! I blinged my copy out by actually making some clay brain tokens.

A very simple press your luck dice game featuring zombies. And brains. Delicious, delicious braaaaaaaains. Games play out in 10-15 minutes and make for a good time filler.

If both players have a basic understanding of mathematics and, particularly, probability and expectation value, then this game reduces to pure luck.  Still, it's fun when you don't have time to play something more meaningful.  Lots of "OH NO!" moments.  :)

Zombie Dice is just a simple, push-your-luck game. Not much to think about. BUT how many games are this portable, and you can play it in 5 minutes (if you go head-to-head for only 2 or 3 turns and see who gets more brains). As a tutor, I sometimes have some extra time at the end of class, usually 5 minutes or less. Instead of hang-man, or tic-tac-toe, I can play this and it's a blast! You can even play this game by yourself.

Great game! Bought it randomly, because i wanted an easy game that I could play no matter how many people were over and that's exactly what it is. Everyone who has played it loves it. For a simple game it still has enough complexity to make it fun. I would recommend it to anyone. Especially for the price.

Quick and silly, it's similar to plenty of other risk-taking dice games mechanically (think Catan Dice, Pikomino, 10,000, etc) but faster to play than most as you can make it through a round in five or six minutes. The theme could be a bit better implemented but I see this making a great side game. Great art on the included dice cup is a plus.

A fast, silly, push-your-luck dice game. Roll the dice and try to collect as many brains as you can without getting shot thrice.

It's not a favorite game by any means, but it's a good game to being along to any gaming meet-up as a quick filler. If you're playing a long game with 15 minute (or more) turns, you can even play a quick game (or two) of Zombie Dice between each turn.

This game is only filler, but it fits that role well.

Roll them dice!

Nice and light, theme is completely irrelevant, but fun to joke around with. Decent game for a group that isn't necessarily wanting to focus on a more demanding game, and there were lots of great moments where people tried to push their luck and either succeeded brilliantly, or went down in a blaze of glory. I would be willing to play it if others were in the mood, but I would never seek it out independently. 

Challenge: roll 5 shotgun blasts and nothing else. There's no way to possibly roll worse than that, and I NAILED it.

Greedy/Push your luck game but with zombies. Well, no zombie components as the players are the zombies. I don't care for zombies at all, but I didn't hate this. It's kind of fun for 10 minutes or so.

I played with some of the add-on dice (Santa, hot girl, etc...) They didn't add a whole lot--occasionally they neutralized or affected something.

I'd recommend this as filler to AT types with a caveat. Most of the fun is derived externally. The jokes get old fast. The caveat--this is almost multi-zombie solitaire. You can't knock off other zombies. You can only press your luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Zombie Dice is a simple game that provides a portable, easy-to-learn game of pushing one's luck.

The only caveat is that it is better with fewer players. More players means more downtime.

There are more interesting games with this mechanic, but it does what it sets out to do.

You randomly select three dice to roll, and there are three varieties of dice.  Some are weighted toward good results, some toward bad results, and some in-between.  You continue as long as you decide to press your luck or until you bust out with three bad die results.

Random dice chucking fun with just a touch of weighing what dice you have and what's left in the can to decide whether to press your luck or not.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (August 2014)

Fun light game in the vein of Can`t Stop. I enjoyed it. It has gorgeous dice and fast playtime. Still I HEAVILY dislike that you roll 3 RANDOM dice per turn, if you picked up the 3 red dice you are at a severe disadvantage. I realize these kind of games have lots of uncontrollable luck, but Zombie Dice adds another layer with the 3 dice per roll rule. I prefer Toss Up! and Can´t Stop in which the possible odds are the same for all the players. I think with more plays its rating will go down. 

Another dislike, the tube is too narrow for my hand, so picking up the 3 dice are clumsy and the odds are that I will pick up the last dice that went in. 

Fun theme! Almost no interesting decisions , but as it plays so fast (its main strength) I can bear it.
 
I don’t think I will buy the game because I already own Can’t Stop and Toss Up!, but it is a good filler game to play from time to time, still I don’t think I will ever request it.

A very simple game with a set of 13 unique dice. Players play the role of zombies that are competing to eat the most brains. Players weigh the risks of continuing to roll dice so that they can score higher points, but with the chance of losing all the points for the round.

I've created rules and cards to add campaign play, events, and scenarios. With these additional rules, the game improves, but it is still a very simple game. The game plays very quickly, is entertaining, and works well as a filler.

Fun little press-your-luck filler.  I ended up enjoying this one a lot more than I expected I would.  :-)  I even got the nicer Brain Case canister and bought some little pink, plastic brains from the GeekStore to use for scoring.  :-)  I have had great luck introducing this one to non-gamers... I seem to always get a request to play it again right away!   :-)  Games usually run around 10 minutes, so that is rarely an issue.

RATING: 7
It's stupid, it's random, but everyone needs to own just one game like this (in my case literally just one).  This is definitely the one for me.  Because of that I went all in to try to make the experience as enjoyable as possible.  First off, buy the little pink brains available (even in the BGG Store) so that you can keep score this way vs. pencil and paper.  Second I bought the better cup with the screw on lid.  Third I bought the 2 expansions.  The first is particularly useful in adding some variety (The Hunk, The Hottie, and of all things Santa Claus).  The base game has 3 varieties of characters. Red are the hardest, followed by yellow then green so as you gain a little experience it's not always as obvious when you should or shouldn't risk pushing your luck without factoring in the colors you've already beaten and the ones you have drawn.  I still basically teach the game by saying start out continuing to roll with anything less than 2 shotgun blasts and then stop at 2 but after a few plays you begin to see you can factor in more.  Ultimately the game is still best if you don't try to overthink it.  The last two games I literally rolled 3 shotgun blasts first roll on nearly every turn.  That can happen.  It does suck and maybe the game does too but its fast and fun and easily played by anyone and larger groups at that.  We play it most often with 3 players as a quick filler.

Each turn, you take 3 dice from the box and roll them. A brain symbol is worth one point at the end of the round, while footsteps allow you to reroll this particular dice. Shotgun blasts on the other hand are rather bad, cause if you collect 3 shotgun blasts during your turn, it is over for you and you get no points. After rolling 3 dice, you may decide if you want to score your current brain collection or if you want to push your luck by grabbing new dice so you have 3 again and roll once more.

This was the first press your luck game that I ever bought myself. I loved zombie stuff, despite the board game market being oversaturated with zombie games (and I still haven’t found a zombie survival game that I really like enough to put in my top 100). Mmmmmm. Brainssssss.

In this game, you’re trying to eat 13+ brains before getting shot. Each turn, you roll 3 dice until you either walk away with how many ever brains you collected or get shot 3 times. Green dice have more brains and less shotguns, red have more shotguns and less brains, and yellow are in the middle.

UPDATE: Dropped down pretty far. Much better dice and press your luck games, and I'm less of a fan of those mechanisms overall.

A press your luck game in the same vein as Toss Up, but offers more statistically based decisions and strategy as well as a blisteringly fast play time.

Roll 3 blindly drawn dice. Keep brains and shotgun blasts. Stop and score your brains, keep going and refill your hand to 3 dice (blind draw). You reuse footprints as part of your 3, so the number you refresh to is variable. Get 3 shotgun blasts and lose that rounds' progress. 

The best thing is that of the 13 dice 6 are green (2 footprint, 3 brain, one shotty), 4 are yellow (2 footprint, 2 brain, 2 shotty) and 3 are red (2 footprint, 1 brain, 3 shotty), so now you see the statistical chances for your rolls as well as your blind draws. It's really a neat system.

Neat-O theme as well.

Very little choice involved during the game. It just felt like the game played itself for the most part. The game also felt like it had too much down time even with 3 people (mostly because multiple player's turns passed without any real decision being made). The multiple dice colors was a good idea but unfortunately the execution just wasn't there.

A decent time-filler, good for 10-15 minutes while waiting for the last few stray gamers to show up for the main event. It gets 'old' quickly (low replay value), but that's alright, since one or two games is usually all you need until everyone has arrived or finished their sandwiches... ^_^

RATING: 7
Gioco di dadi della durata di 30 minuti.
Ogni dado ha delle facce che consentono di fare punti, subire delle ferite o essere ritirati. Essendo possibile subire un massimo di 2 ferite il gioco si basa tutto sul fattore rischio che un giocatore vuole correre ritirando i dadi cercando di fare più punti possibile senza arrivare a 3 ferite, raggiunte le quali si perde il turno e tutti punti accumulati.
Simpatico, facile da spiegare, estremamente dipendente dal fattore C.
Molto adatto ai neofiti

RATING: 6.5
Simple game of dice: you are a zombie, and must eat more brains than other zombies.
You get brains by rolling dice, but this means you also risk to be shot and lose your brains.
It's a gamble on how lucky you will be with the next roll.
Fast and funny, it won't last long: leave it for those 15-20 minutes of spare time.

October 2014: Throwing in all four expansion dice makes ZD significantly more engaging, and adds a nice assortment of considerations that give it more depth without much more rules overhead. Still not enough to make it an 8, but it's a solid 7 with the expansions.

it,s very simple to learn. 
You must have 13 brains to win. into the cup there are 13 dice: six green (vulnerable victims), four yellow (medium victims), three red (heavy casualties).
In your turn you must draw out cup three dice and you must throw dice to get brains. You can try more way in your turn.

It's a stupid game, but I like it. It grows on me like decaying flesh doesn't.

Update - When your 4 year old daughter tells you in all honesty that a game is really boring, you have to reconsider your rating. Bumped mine rating down a notch.

Note - I get that this is a light, quick, fun enough game, but I am puzzled by its ranking here on the Geek.  I question the credibility, or at least the judgement of the masses that vote here, when the rankings of a solid Hobbit dice game by Knizia is ranked in the 4500 and this game is comes in around 1000!  Heck, Mmmm... Brains is way more of a dice game than this, quite a bit more fun to play and it is ranked 8400s...  I know I am not the target market for this kind of game but still, "Something smells rotten in Denmark."

I'm not into gore of the zombie theme, but this game is so light that it doesn't bother me at all, i actually rather like it. It's a great push your luck dice game. The game comes in a cup that's annoyingly loud when shuffled on your turn though. we ditch the cup and shake the dice in hand instead. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
1 / 5 - Bad.

Rating might be a little harsh, it fills time and plays quickly. But it's just such lazy design, it's bordering on inexcusable. There are so many push your luck games put there most of which are better or cheaper than this. The theme is meaningless. It's not even funny. So why bother with a custom game when you can just pull out some ordinary dice from another title and fill the time with Zilch or Farkle instead?

RATING: 7
Zombie Dice is a straight forward push-your-luck dice rolling game.  In the thinly pasted on theme, players are zombies who are trying to eat as many brains as possible, without getting hit by the shotgun blasts of the humans who are fighting back.

On a player's turn they will blindly take three dice out of the cup and roll them.  Brains are good, you get as many points as you roll brains.  Little footsteps represent humans who have run away, and don't count as anything.  Shotgun blasts are bad and count against you.  The active player will continue to take and roll dice as long as they want adding up the number of brains they get.  They can stop and pass their turn whenever they want to secure the number of brains they rolled.  If at any time during a given turn the player rolls three shotgun blasts they lose all the brains they rolled this turn.  The fist player to get thirteen points or more triggers the last round.  Whomever gets the most brains/points wins.

There are three colours of dice.  They are green, yellow, and red.  The greens have the most brains, and the fewest shotgun blasts.  Yellow have an equal number of brains, runners, and shotgun blasts.  Red have the greatest number of shotgun blasts, and fewest brains.  There are six green dice, four yellow dice, and three red dice that come with the game.

Zombie Dice is light, fun, filler of a game.  It's also good with kids.  I recommend it.

A quick, easy, and marginally fun game that can be played with any number of people in under 10-15 minutes.

Gameplay is dead simple and is a nice mix of luck and risk management that has a lot of flexibility for house rules, alternate rules, etc. Dice are also unique and fun, though the cardboard cup construction is a bit cheap and needs a little doctoring to keep zealous shakers from popping the plastic caps off.

It's a good filler game while waiting for people to show up or between rounds when you need something to do and also makes a fun drinking board game.

Quick dice games are always great to have on hand.  This simple "push your luck" mechanic works, but other than continuing or stopping really doesn't provide for any strategic decision making.  For that, I would recommend Martian Dice which at least allows you to make a decision each roll about which dice to keep.  Also, since you're only drawing 1-3 dice at a time, I highly recommend getting a cloth bag or something to use instead of the can (I keep my dice in a bag, in the can).

Game in a Nutshell: Zombie themed, dice game of rolling brains before getting shot too terribly much.

Played as: 4 player.

Pros: Very simple, but exciting... as any good press-your-luck should be. I like how they made some dice more dangerous thatn others in order to vary the odds from one roll to the next. The games are short and no one is really ever out as there's no reason a great string of luck couldn't bring you from way back into the lead.

Cons: Too simplistic? It's still your basic, "go or stop" decision repeated over and over. Other than that, it's all luck of the dice. Pretty abstracted theme.

Other: I was a bit surprised by this one. Wasn't expecting much but found it to be one of the most uproarious games I played at the con I demoed this at.

Best Use: I wouldn't hesitate to use this as a filler to get the juices flowing.

No real depth, but a great little pick-up to play while waiting. I can imagine playing this to pass time while waiting for movies, meals to be served in cafes, or simply when we're out with nothing else to do. Won't ever be played in my board game nights, but I imagine this will kill a lot of time when we're out and about.

As a games night game, this would rate substantially lower for it's basic gameplay, for a travel game, it gets a 6. If you're out and about and end up waiting a lot, it's a good pickup for the price.

What makes a game? Choice. And there is precious little choice in Zombie Dice. You roll dice, and either it works, or it doesn't work. Your sole choice is: do I roll more dice? It DOES have a place, and that place is the end of the night, when the beer's been drunk and the last joint is being passed around, and the late bus is already gone but the early bus is forty-five minutes away and, damnit, you're just not done playing stuff yet. It's a group exercise in abnegation. Useful, yes, but laudable, hardly.

Fantastic game: it's incredibly simple, yet pretty flavorful; a push your luck dice game that's great to play with groups of all sorts and sizes. I know some people want to yank their hairs from their heads when they see games like this get scores as high as Twilight Imperium 3 or Dominant Species, but a game should be judged by how well it does what it wants to do, and this one does its thing perfectly!

Awesome filler... the only reason not to like this is either a you HATE zombies (yes, hate that theme, because if it's just a light dislike, you'll probably enjoy the game) or HATE dice games... other than that, if you were looking for a good filler, look no further :)

Simple and fast, but very unoriginal. It's as fun as your group makes it, but it's fun in the way any sort of die rolling is fun. It's push your luck with very little skill and often obvious decisions. Sure it's fun, but there's not much game here. Feels like someone slapped some zombie related images on some dice, spent 15 minutes writing rules, threw it all in a canister and sold it.

Zombie dice is a simple push your luck game. All the players are zombies who try to have some supper.. In Zombie dice you try to collect victory points (brain symbols)and avoid being shot (blast symbols). If some of your victims tun away (footprints) you can reroll those dice. Whoever gets 13 points first launches the final round. Game is simple and nearly 100% luck so it suits children more than adults. Gamers beware. My copy is at school as an amusement for my pupils (alongside memory, chess and checkers).

Számomra nagy csalódás. 'Miért, mit vársz egy kockajátéktól?' Döntéshelyzet okozta minimális izgalmat! A Zombie Dice esetében csak arról dönthetek, hogy meddig dobálok, csak az a kérdés, mekkorát kockáztatok. És nem is szórakoztató. Lehet az a gond, hogy a Heckmecket (Kac Kac Kukac) előbb játszottam, mert az ennél ezerszer jobb!!!

Zombie Würfel ist ein lustiges Würfelspiel für Zwischendurch. Das Thema ist etwas aufgesetzt, aber zumindest die Symbole auf den Würfeln, bringen hier etwas Zombieflair ins Spiel. Der Ablauf ist simpel: Man würfelt und legt die Gehirne und die Schüsse zur Seite. Hat man drei Schüsse ist die Runde vorbei und man geht leer aus. Wenn nicht, kann der Spieler weitermachen 8auf die gefahr hin seine drei Schüsse zu erhalten), oder aufhören. In dem Fall notiert sich der Spieler die Anzahl an Gehirnen als Siegpunkte. Wer zeurst 13 Gehirne hat, hat gewonnen. Klingt so einfach wie es ist! Für 2 schnelle Runden Zwischendurch völlig in Ordnung.

Its nothing but a push your luck dice game really, but its over so fast its almost impossible to get bored of!

Its Zombie theme makes it very popular with non-gamers whilst also still being appealing to real gamers as a good filler option. Its small and portable making it excellent for taking to a party or on travels.

I find it difficult to rate it any higher then a 6, but only because the content is so slight there's not really much to rate!

I prefer the strategy of Kings of Tokyo, but Zombie Dice is DEFINITELY better then Mmmm, Brains!!! (another Zombie themed dice game which is total crap, even if it does have cool brain miniatures!).

The expansion adds 3 different dice with very little extra effect, you don't need it to get the most from this game.

First impressio (5 players): A rather silly push-your-luck dice game with a bit of zombie theme pasted on. All about luck with veeery little of real decisions during the game. Rather fun though. Gets a bit better with a rules variant where you always have one turn to beat score of 13 (or more) by getting at least one more brain. This usually makes the game 1-2 rounds longer but it's not a lot.

Zombie dice (with both expansions) can always be found on or near my person.  I keep a small arsenal of games with me for whenever my friends and I need a quick distraction.  Long games can be fun, but this is a quick, fun game that can be played while you wait for everyone else to finish setting up.

Its a great filler, but something you will likely only play once in a gaming session before moving on to the next thing. Its fine for children though, but keep an eye on the dice because they will happily let one drop as they pack up and just walk away because it didn't fall within easy reach.

Quick, fun risk-management game turns you into a zombie on the hunt for brains. Roll your dice to collect as many of the delicious delicacies as possible, but push your luck against the deadly gunshots and you risk losing it all for nothing. Great, fast, light fun for everyone.

Zombie Dice comes in round tin about the size of a water-glasss, which is used to hide the dice from view when a player decides to select extras to roll. There are 13 special dice: green dice have 1 shotgun and 1 brain, yellows 2 and 1, reds have 3 shotguns and 1 brain. All the dice other faces show no effect. A player rolls 3 dice selected at random, setting aside any brains or shotguns. Three shotguns means turn over with no score. A player can decide to end his turn after rolling, scoring any accumulated brains. Otherwise they re-roll, with additional dice so they are always rolling three at a time.
The dice have been specially made and look great - I'm buying this game for the dice alone. The cup and score-pad are functional. Games are over in a twinkling. Zombie Dice is not rocket science, but it's a fun diversion.

Zombieeees! Well, I am a fan of dice and push your luck games. This is a very quick and light one to play. Roll the dice, keep the brains. Any explosion dice are set aside until there are three. Collect your points in brains. First person to 50pts wins.

RATING: 6
I mark this down with a heavy heart because I do enjoy it and it is fun. However there are problems with it. It is so light it is basically an activity rather than a game; it is push your luck with a capital LUCK and not much push really. Also the components are a mixed tube. The dice are nice, but with the colour choice here yellow, red and green, my guess is you can't play this if colour blind. Finally the tube it comes in is not fit for purpose, the top and bottom pop off pretty easily and you can't get even half a hand into it to get the dice out. It is basically a cardboard monkey trap. With blue dice rather than green and a bag this activity would be a nine. But there you go

Brains good. Shotguns bad. This game gets a lot of hate because of the theme and that it's a Steve Jackson game but it's a clever little luck pressing dice game, especially with the coloured dice having different face distributions for easy,  medium and risky. Could have done with some scoring tokens but have pimped mine with pink plastic brains.

A very ordinary dice game that's only really sellable and playable because of the de rigeur mindless zombie theme. The one twist it provides is that there are three types of dice, with 1, 2 and 3 "crash" results on them respectively, and you don't know which ones you're going to get to roll each time you choose to roll - you pick them blindly out of a cup. Which adds to the chaos. A turn is to draw out 3 dice, roll, keep "crashes" and "brains", and re-roll "re-rolls" if you want to continue (pulling out more blind dice to ensure you always roll 3 dice). If you get to 3 crashes you score zero. If you pull out beforehand, score your brains, first to 13 brains wins. Downtime is pure. There's little control. It lacks the fun of better push-your-luck dice games like Go Nuts. I can't see any reason to play again really, unless desperate to play something, anything, to fill in 10 minutes.

Picked this up for my 15-year-old at Congress of Gamers 2011 from Our Game Table.  No intention of trying it with him, since I hate zombie games, but he likes them, so there it is...

This is my favorite of the quick portable microgame-style dice games. Dice Like Crack !!  A Light Push-Your-Luck Dice Set Collection Game Better Than Yahtzee !!

"Very light push-your-luck dice game. Few decisions, but plays fast, with quick turns. Pulling dice out of the can is super inconvenient. A bag seems like a necessity."

What I like:
- Simple, fast, portable

What I don't like:
- The rules are a bit counter-intuitive at first
- Not a lot of decisions to make
- I would prefer the dino theme

I'd say this is another brainless Yahtzee game, but the game actually features brains on the dice.  You're rolling a bunch of dice trying to get brains and avoid shotguns.  You can re-roll non-shotgun dice, possibly getting you more brains or more shotguns, or you can end your turn and "bank" your brains.  All in all, there's not really much there.

Playtime: ~5-15 minutes

Comment: Basically 2 rules, chucking dice and hoping for the best. It's a push your luck game that can be played while eating. It's nothing amazing, nothing outstanding, but it does exactly what you'd expect it to. Theme is practically non-existent and the cardboard cup is annoying. I won't ask to play it, but I'd be willing to play it if we need something as a filler between games.

Optimal Player Count: 6 or less.
With more than 6 is just starts to drag. Even 6 is pushing it.

I don't particularly like the endgame and I initially rated it a 5.

I enjoy this fun, little filler of eating more brains vs your opponents.  The press-your-luck aspect is decently implemented.

We play with the popular variant, when the first player gets over 13, every following player must beat it or get eliminated, then the original player must beat the new number and so on until one player is left.

A basic push-your-luck game. But the kids love it, and thus, I do as well. Games are incredibly quick, can be quite exciting when you are just going "one more time".

This game is perfect for kids and adults to play together. Due to it's crazy high luck component, skill is neutralized and all players are on equal footing. When your 5 year old has just as good a chance to win as you do, they are going to have fun.

Some basic skills can be learned as well. Basic adding, calculating risk (is it worth trying to get one more brain?), etc.

Chalming and awsome fun press your luck dice. 

Can't play it everyday but that's mostly becuase other people don't want to... those bastards. I'd play whenever. 

Great for a party, great with a drink, great if everyone puts a £ in, winner takes all (press your luck and betting is just a good combo). 

Two things: 
The dice shaker makes a horrible loud sound. 
You'll need some method of keeping score. (epecially if you've decided it does indeed go great with a drink) (And it does)

Its a basic game that is easy and fast to play,Also a lot of fun! You roll the dice hoping for brains and try to avoid gunshots,keep rolling and counting the brains you get but all that hard work during that round gathering brains could be ended by 3 shot gun blasts. So you press your luck and keep rolling or stop and take score,once someone hits 13 brains the game will come to a end after 1 final round,High score wins!
Lots of fun and makes a nice gambling game if you want to add a little more excitement.

This is not a deep game. Pure push-your-luck with a silly zombie theme. It is a nice filler game...it's fast and portable. It's perfect to pull out on a game night between heavier games to lighten the mood. However, don't go looking for deep strategy here. It is what it is...fluff, but amusing fluff.

6 - Super light push-your-luck game, easy to learn, easy to play, doesn't really hook anyone since it's literally just rolling dice.

Played it a few times, picked it up as an "in between" kind of game in longer D&D sessions where players were in completely different areas not interacting but the constant dice rolling was distracting.

A press your luck game that is reminiscent of Dragon Slayer if Dragon Slayer wasn't complete garbage, due to the implementation of an actual press your luck element like in Can't Stop, but flawed by the end goal simply being a number of points.

Superlight Push Your Luck Filler with a neat "theme". I  say theme but it's really just the artwork on the casing and coloured dice. It is barely playable with my house rules but otherwise just an act of randomness. Might be fun with kids or non-gamers as a filler.

I'm as much a fan of beer-and-pretzels games (including Steve Jackson games) as the next guy, but there's something distinctly unimpressive about this push-your-luck game.
All you do is roll and see what you get - there's much less opportunity for decisions in Zombie Dice than in any other push-your-luck game I know of.
(Other than the cheap price and zombie theme) It's fairly baffling why this is more successful (higher regarded?) than Can't Stop, Incan Gold, Monopoly Express, or even Dungeon Dice.

Can't...stop...playing. Now have it for the iOS, but not quite the same.

Pros: Nice quality custom dice.

Cons: Cheap quality in packaging.  Should have included a quality plastic dice cup to compliment the dice.  For a very simple game, the rules are written pretty bad.

I like the three types of custom dice provided with the game, but I think the tack-on Zombie theme is weak.  The game is simple and goes fast.  Some people prefer to play to a higher score like 20 points, but I find it hardly worth it.  Staying with the silly theme of the game and that Steve Jackson seems to think 13 dice is a magic number (unlucky zombies?), I'd recommend playing to 13 points.  Here's where I'd change the rules:

During a turn, there's an awkward rule by which you recycle dice when there are no more left in the cup.  Essentially having it such that someone with zero points can still come back and win the game.  The extra rules in place to handle this situation are awkward.  I would have it such that once all the dice in the cup are used, your turn is over and you take your score.  Meaning, the highest possible score you can take in a single turn is 13 points.  Call it a Zombieside.

I'm a big Greed player and love playing with Zilch rules.  It's add flavor to the game.  I would add a Zilch option to Zombie dice.  If at any time you roll 3 shotguns in a single roll, you're total score goes to zero.  Harsh yeah, and pretty unlucky, but this game is all about luck.  This just adds that extra moment to laugh during the game.  My daughter and I call it a MegaBlam.

Why the low rating?  Compared to other simple push your luck games, I think bang for the buck, this game falls short.  I like the added twist of 3 types of custom dice, but the overall packaging and slap-on theme detract from what could have been something better.  In comparison to Toss-Up, a similar game with custom dice, I'd recommend Toss-Up.

Simple, quick, and surprisingly engaging push your luck game.  Reminds me most of Pigmania (but that may be due to the cardboard cup! :) ).

Great filler.  Great with kids....even young kids.  This and Love Letter are my favorite 'restaurant' games.

Let's face it, there is something fun about push your luck.  This ranks just after Incan Gold and Can't Stop for push your luck games in my book.  Except this one has zero setup and is quicker and more portable.

Recommended.

Lighten up, you chuds.

No strategy, one decision, loads of fun.

So, I'm 14-3 up against my daughter and I taunt her by saying "Well, in theory you COULD roll 11 to tie or 12 to win on your last roll." Because, you know, suffering builds character.

She glares at me and rolls three brains.  And another three. And another three.  And another three, and a shot on red.

Twelve brains. Twelve. Brains. Check my sums, I make that 1,179,648 to 1, a moment that we'll both treasure, and cheap at the price.

Great little push-your-luck dice game.  Extremely light- you can explain it and play within seconds- but is probably too light for a lot of gamers.

For me, it does a great job combining the tactile pleasure of rolling chunky dice with a very simple push-your-luck decision to make.  The zombie theme is very light, but fun and works well for the game.  

The dice are of very nice quality, an attractive black color with engraved and painted custom designs on the faces.  The brain and shotgun blast icons look great, and are easily identifable. They give the game its charm and visual appeal.   

A great, ultra-quick filler to pull out with shyer party goers to get them into the action.  Everyone loves throwing dice!

I'm looking forward to playing with the expansion dice, to add a little variety to the game.  A recent schoolbus D12 expansion has also been announced, looks fun.

RATING: 6.5
Mindless dice game. Take three random cubes and roll. Re-roll as often as you like but always set aside the "shotgun" and "brain" results, replacing those set aside with randomly drawn cubes from the cup. (So you always have three dice to roll.)  If you acquire three shotguns or more, you die and score nothing this turn. Otherwise, when you stop rolling you score 1 point per "brain" result. In either case, put the dice back into the cup and pass to the next player. Play until someone collects 13 points.

Mostly this is just push-your-luck, but the dice come in three colors. The green ones are more likely to give out brains, and the red ones are more likely to get you shot. Making determination based on the color of your dice and the dice set aside so far adds a smidgen of thought to simple dicefest.

But you know I like zombies.

A fun little dice filler that is better to play than a lot of other games that are "deeper".  It's fun to watch someone press their luck only to draw red dice and then get shotgunned.  Good stuff!

Let's also add that my 5-year old daughter LOVES this.  We just call the shotgun blasts, explosions instead.

Perfect filler game to start off a game night or between longer games.

My son and I played it and kept saying "Brains!!!"  Seemed like we rolled better when saying that. :)  Definitely recommend as a way to get a night off to an interesting start, or for a longer "Who Goes First" pre-game to a main game, and if you don't have Cthulhu Dice for that already, this is an excellent follow on to that concept!  Time to eat!  Oh, and believe it or not, I got my 70 and 71 year old parents to play this  (and they are NOT gamers) and they were a riot.  7 people all screaming BRAINS and cheering or Awwing each other.  We came up with a new house rule.  If you don't get ANY brains by the end of the game, you are deemed, BRAINLESS! :)  Another new rule was created for those with no brains at the end of the game.  They must sing "If I only had a brain" from the Wizard of Oz.

Many might scoff at this game, but I think Zombie Dice is the definition of portable filler. There is something to be said for games that consist of just some dice and works with any number of players. Obviously the theme can be a bit weird for some, but this has worked quite well with my family. It's certainly not a great game, but it does what it wants to well. If you're ever stuck somewhere or waiting in line, this is a game that will make passing the time much more enjoyable.

Very light, push-your-luck game that has been a hit so far in that "mindless filler" category.  Figures that a game about eating brains would be mindless!  Really a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game to play at the start of your gaming session or at the end when you only have a little bit of time left and still want to get a quick game in. This is also a great filler game you can take with you easily like if you travel or you can take it to work to play with coworkers to kill some time or play with friends wherever you are. It's a short game that involves throwing 3 dice to see if you can rack up brains. first person to rack up 13 brains wins but be carefull, 3 shotgun blasts and you lose your points scored for that round (not the entire game). 

This game has been somewhat popular in my game groups.

A solo variant I came up with:

See if you can rack up 13 brains (or any number of brains that you choose) before you reach a certain number of shotgun blasts that you set before the game starts (shotgun blasts must always be lower than the number of brains you need to get to win). for instance.. say you go to 13 brains. You can see if you will rack up the 13 brains before you get 7 (or whatever number you choose) shotgun blasts. You play as normal just you keep track of how many shotgun blasts you get so you will record both your brain score and shotgun blast score. You do not lose your shotgun blast score as you do your brain score when you rack up 3 shotgun blasts. You will keep track of all shotgun blasts that you receive. 

Example play:

Object: Getting 13 brains before reaching 8 shotgun blasts. 

The game play:
You play as normal. Shake up the dice and pick 3 dice to roll. After rolling the 3 dice, you count the brains you have plus shotgun blasts and set them aside. Any feet you get need to be rerolled with other dice in the cup to make 3 dice you roll. When you've reached 3 shotgun blasts you will lose your current brain score you racked up for that round. The dice currently being used and the ones set aside now go back in the cup but be sure to keep track of your shotgun blasts. This score never goes away and is always scored when you roll them. Play again as normal until you've either racked up 13 brains or 8 shotgun blasts. 

When you get 13 brains before being shot 8 times you win. If you get shot 8 times before getting 13 brains, you lose!

This one, despite being designed by [person=22]Steve Jackson[/person], is actually kind of fun. It's a simple push-your-luck dice-rolling game. There are 13 dice in the cup: 3 red (high risk, brains/shots/blanks = 1/3/2), 4 yellow (2/2/2), 6 green (low risk: 3/1/2). On your turn, draw randomly to a hand size of 3 dice, roll them, and setting aside any brains and shots. Repeat until you decide to stop (score total number of brains set aside) or roll a total of 3 shots (you lose). The first player to roll a total of at least 13 brains wins!

Mmmm braaiiiiins! A winner!

Decent game to start the night yet too simple in its mechanics to get excited about. Great that it holds as many or as few people as you like, and splendid that it is about being a Zombie and collecting as many brains as possible (well, 13 actually) but when the only decision is whether you risk to roll the dice again and maybe get shot or rather get lucky and find more brains, it falls a bit flat. But only a bit.

RATING: 6
A quick and simple dice game - roll the dice and hope to get brains (or re-rolls) instead of shotgun blasts. You can push your luck or play it safe. First player to 13 brains wins. Easy as pie! You can teach a new player in under 5min and there's no board to set up or tokens to keep track of. People get really into it, too.

It would be a great "play anywhere" game EXCEPT for the fact it's noisy, especially when you shake the dice in their canister. I've been meaning to sew a pouch and sound-muffling play mat for the game; if I ever get around to doing that, I'll report back.

Zombie Dice really is incredibly simple and boring yet if I had 10 minutes to kill I would play it.  But I think 10 minutes is about all its good for and anything over that would become tedious very quickly.

I also think the game is horrendously overpriced for 13 very simple 6-sided dice.

Umm, it's a push your luck dice game.  I suppose it's no worse than some of the ones out there.  I mean, I guess you really have less decisions in this one as opposed to Can't Stop.  But this one takes like 5 minutes and Can't Stop takes like 30 min.

It's better than Cthulhu dice...  I'll give it that.  Plus I'd rather play it then Martian Dice, because then at least you're not rolling the whole set at any one time, which makes the decision points a little longer.

RATING: 9
This game is as simple a game can get without lacking all gameplay elements whatsoever.  It is this that makes the game enjoyable, whether it is with small groups of people (even two players) to rest the mind after 1v1 competitive games or with a huge group of people who need to be explained the rules.  Everyone can learn everything they need to know on the first player's turn.

The press-your-luck dice mechanics and fun probability twists with the colors of the die make the game.  The major issue with it is the advantage the last player gets due to vision of previous rolls but this is a minor complaint since this game is about fun, not balance.

Like Tsuro I am probably being too generous given how simple this game is, but also like Tsuro, no one has ever told me they disliked it.  Everyone has enjoyed it, many more have asked for the name of the game so they can go out and buy it.  How could I not at least give what I consider to be one of the simplest yet best dice games of all time a good rating?

Dados Zombie es un juego de dados rápido y fácil de aprender. Los 13 dados especiales son tus víctimas. Debes lanzarlos y coleccionar cerebros, pero debes parar antes de recibir 3 disparos que acaben con tu turno y con los cerebros conseguidos en ese turno. El que antes llegue a coleccionar 13 cerebros, gana. 
Es un juego simple de dados para relajarse un ratillo con los amigos.

Depth of strategy and decision making parallels LCR  

Edit: okay, I couldn't resist adding more to my comment after I found out the overall rating of this game isn't a 2 point something.  Here is the game: you roll dice and count the brains you roll.  You keep rolling until you roll three shotgun blasts or pass.  Roll 3 shotguns and lose the brains you captured.  First one to 13 wins.
Just because this "genre" has a name (e.g. "press your luck") doesn't make this a good game.

Just terrible.

For what it is, Zombie Dice is a surprisingly great press-your-luck game to fill time between heavier games or just simply as a light game to play one evening when you're tired or don't feel like thinking much. The strategy, if there is one, is obvious; the fun comes in goading your opponent into stupid moves or simply laughing about the concept--to gain as many brains as you can before you are shot. Because you have to use pen and paper to keep track of your points, we end up scrawling pictures or funny notes all over the page after we crown the victor. It really is better if you have the right people and a good sense of humor.

RATING: 5
A harmless if uninspired push-your-luck dice game. With Cosmic Wimpout, Farkle, Yahtzee and a host of other die-rolling games out there, I was expecting Zombie Dice to have some new twists. It doesn't, but it's still a pleasant little diversion.

Zombie Dice is so simple, it's hard for me to call it a game. It's more like a time killer for me. But my nieces and nephews play this for hours on end!

Or perhaps use it as a reward for finishing household chores.

So close to not-a-game that I can't deny it a 1 rating. Decisions are rare, interaction almost non-existent, and same with the theme.

I also can't understand the mentality of a designer who's making a game with custom d6s, but only comes up with three distinct die faces. So even the bits are not that cool.

Candyland rates higher because you can mod it. I don't know what the hell to do with this.

This game pretty much boils down to 'keep rolling until you have two shotgun dice, then stop unless it's the last round and you're losing'.

I'm pretty sick of zombies, but I think this holds up pretty well as a quick push-your-luck game even aside from the theme. It's basically just a more forgiving version of Pig plus a lotto element of dice with more "pigs" and fewer points. But it turns out that that's pretty much what Pig needed.

One play with my wife and we loved it.  I didn't think it would be that fun, actually, and i like dice.

Was not going to buy this one, but the shop (Sentry Box in Calgary - great shop) had a demo copy.  

Nov 2010 - upped one point to 8.5.  We love it, the nearly-7 year old boy loves it.  Fun and mostly mindless.

This is a good push-your-luck game.  I was able to play a demo at PAX East.  I liked how it has three different d6 dice with different ratios on them, it changes the "should I keep going" decision for each player/situation.

Simple press-your-luck dice game.  Fun components - the custom dice artwork is oddly compelling.

Brilliant but silly 'push your luck' dice roller.

Took a few minutes to figure out the rules. The only thing that didn't seem clear in the rules is that if you get all 3 shotguns then you lose all points you've accumulated that turn (at least, that's how we decided to play).

I could totally see why tons of people would hate this game. It's basically just rolling dice and getting lucky or not. However, the theme actually is pretty fun with this one (and that's pretty impressive with the overly exhausted zombie theme). My game group has actually started playing Zombie Dice to determine who gets to choose which game we play next as it only takes about 5 minutes to play a full game. I'd recommend this for any gaming collection as they are neat dice (although a bit overpriced...).

UPDATE: Traded. It was simply too basic and dumb. I didn't know anyone who would want to play it. 

***

It's a press your luck game. It's tense, it's silly, it's fun, it's brainless, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.

It pares silly luck-based games to their bare essentials, and does it very well. And sometimes, a brainless dice fest is just what you need.

I find it better than Martian Dice, which is slightly too tactical for a short competitive brainless dice fest.

I like rolling dice, but I also like to be able to make some decisions during my games.  This sort of removes all thinking from the push-your-luck game.  If one could pick which dice he wanted to roll out of the 13, instead of drawing them randomly, it might have a bit of a tactical edge to it, but right now, it's just a matter of deciding when you want to quit.  I'll take Can't Stop instead.

One of the simplest games ever to pick up and play with almost zero time to teach new players...in fact, you can teach as soon as you start playing with as little lag time as possible.  Excellent press your luck type of dice game where you play the roll of the zombies...nice.  Game time varies greatly with the number of players (no limit) and the luck of the dice rolls.  Can play with only two players but the more you have the fun factor increases exponentially.  Braiiiiiins.

Hay que eliminar, eso si, la regla de que todos los jugadores tienen las mismas rondas, y lo del jugador inicial, si no el último jugador jugará a la desesperada y tendrá muchas más posibilidades de ganar.

Hay que aplicar la regla de que en cuanto un jugador logre las trece víctimas gana.

Our oldest daughter received this one for Christmas as well. It's a simple push-your-luck dice chucking game, that is very enjoyable for those around the table right before or right after another game with a little more heft.

A good push-your-luck dice game. The zombies theme is fun, and there are different types of dice which have different probabilities of coming up good or bad for you, which gives you some semblance of meaningful decision-making. But it's still ultimately very luck-heavy. Fun for a quick filler, but no more.

It's Farkle with Zombies! We only play this game as a quick take it anywhere sort of game. We've played it at parade's and at fireworks in traffic jams etc. We used to play Farkle in all these situations now we play this. So basically it's the same game. Which doesn't make it bad really just more of the same but now with more BRAINZ!

I pick up small games like this every now and then and do not ever expect too much.  

Zombie Dice offers some fun, but it is essentially luck driven as with any dice fest.

I was drawn to the theme and feel the game mechanic is a unique way of recreating zombie attacks/combat.

I think it makes a pretty good beer 'n pretzels game with the right group, just don't expect much.

Can't say a whole heck of a lot here.  
You roll dice.  Then you roll more.  Then you roll over and bust.  Next player does the same.  Rinse, repeat.  But you pretend to be zombies.   And that's what is fun - pretending to be zombies trying to eat brains.  You'll laugh about your pretend zombie attack narrative, (especially if you have the hunk/cheerleader/Santa/schoolbus expansions), but in the end, it's just a push-your-luck dice game with zero interactivity and zero variation.  
It's fun.  To a point.  And then I just want to put it away and play something with more... fun...

Luck fest.  Amusing if someone makes zombie sounds the first time through.  By the third play, the theme is flat.  Not much game here.  It's basically press your luck.

After 1 play: Since you have zero control over which dice you keep, your only choice is whether to continue.  Most of those "decisions" are obvious, so really you only get to choose a few times a game.  Those choices have an infinitesimally small effect compared to how you roll.

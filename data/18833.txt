RATING: 8
This game is like Stratego, but fun! It has a great theme (LotR) and each character has a special ability. Also, both sides are not equal as they each have their own characters and action cards (makes switching sides fun!).

The Deluxe edition comes with an alternative for each character and some extra super cards which can only be used once per game. Definitely get the Deluxe version if you are considering getting this game.

A fun update of Stratego.  Thanks to the combat cards and the character special abilities, it becomes a much more tactical game.  Fun, and exceptionally fast.

Short and perfectly balanced, with ridiculous tension. Amazingly, every fight seems to come down to two possibilities based on the cards played, so there's a lot of second guessing as to what your opponent is willing to lay down in a given contest.

Rated after one play: a first impression only!Seems like an interesting two-player game with fairly simple basic mechanics, but apparently a lot of strategic depth once you get a hang of it. I love the theme and the wonderful components. Beautiful and elegant.

RATING: 7.5
Not enough plays of this to weigh in on things adequately, so I consider this a temporary rating. One of the few older Knizia titles that I had neglected to purchase until recently. It's an interesting, chess-like game set in the LotR universe.

RATING: 7
Very good and intense game in the same spirit as Stratego (but a lot more interesting IMO). I have the deluxe edition which allows for different powers on the characters which should enhance replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An excellent take on Stratego. Characters with special abilities make for a surprisingly tense game that often comes down to the final rush to get to your goal your opponent gets to theirs.

LOTR:TC is a battle of wits.  You cannot help but move forward and clash with your opponent, but you don't know just what such a fight will entail: the identity of the pieces are hidden, and the outcome of the battle is modified by piece strength and special power text, as well as card strength or special power text.  

As you continue to play, you pay attention to the cards your opponent has played and divine what he might play in response to your intended play.  You think on the pieces he has left and think about what each might be, if you have enough information to do so.

It's a game of guessing, of tactical plays and strategic positioning.  It's fairly quick to play, fun, and very thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best in the stratego line. By very far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You could call LotR: The Confrontation asymmetrical Chess of many surprises. On your first plays you are only learning the special abilities and rules of each character. It takes several plays to memorise them all and to learn to use your knowledge to your advantage. And this is the point where the game starts to shine. This is simply because the bluffing element of the game is virtually meaningless unless both players are familiar with the rules. What is the point of bluffing if your opponent does not understand the risk. 

But there are other elements to the game besides outguessing your opponent. There is plenty of room for deduction and making safe calls, thus introducing layers of meaningful decision making into the experience.

The main difference between the deluxe version and the original is the introduction of extra characters into the game, which adds to the replay value. The looks has been improved a little as well.

In a nutshell, the game offers great moments with experienced players. Be ready to invest some time and make sure you have a regular playing partner.

RATING: 5
1st play: Stratego with some card play and LOTR theming.  Improved though as I always feel Stratego is too random, where this has some good tactical play.  The asymmetric powers and strengths make for interesting interactions and the playtime is nice and to the point.  Perhaps the best LOTR game I've played, but the bar isn't very high on that one either.

No second play - 2 player games are just too hard to get to the table.  I'd be fine playing this game again, but I won't remember to request it probably.

This is a great stratego-style game, which captures the essence of Lord of the Rings in a 30 minute play. A real [i]tour de force[/i] full of tension.

A classic of contemporary board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Adds to the original game with variant characters. The variant plays very differently. It is still entertaining to play with the variants. But the mix and match game will produce a less right design, as the character powers don't work that well anymore. 

The victory condition for the variant too changes and create a different need and strategy to play. 

Overall, an excellent and simple strategy game that can be play in half an hour. Highly replay able. 

Would be interesting if both sets could be played at the same time as an epic battle.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great game for two players, highly thematic with a nice design.

If played with a worthy opponent can present some tough choices and the confrontation can be really close to who will win.

Many times reached the point of I thought that you thought the thing I was thinking that you thought initially ergo the whole loop repeats with some of my friends.

Can easily play it 4 times or more in a row.

RATING: 9.5
After two more plays, I love this game. Once you get involved and start to know the tactics and the buffling in the game, you enjoy it a lot. In addition, it's a fast game. Moreover, deluxe edition add a lot more variants increasing replayability.
2011: The more we play the more we like it. The definitive game for two players.

A solid game with no luck, but pure psychological brinksmanship. Only a couple of plays, and I've only been Fellowship. I suspect that game is tightly balanced, but the Fellowship is tough. A single "lucky" stab can kill Frodo off (though Frodo's sideways retreat is crucial here) and you have to try to manipulate your characters such that they'll match up against the key "autokill" enemies (and keeping their identities hidden). The Sauron side feels like it would be more straight-forward, but obviously with a trickier win condition. It's an excellent game, a great take on Stratego, and something that's a good bit different from any other game I own. A keeper.

RATING: N/A
I had the original and gave it to my brother because I knew the new one was coming out, and one of the walls for black had a weird line through it that made it obvious what it was/ tipped the hand.

I was excited for this because of the large board, but when I opened it and checked it out, I just found the artwork gave it way too much of a dark vibe for me compared to the artwork of the Kosmos one which wasn't as overwhelming to me.

I'm not going to get rid of this version though, as it is a great game which will unlikely ever be reprinted again. 

I will seek out a copy of the original though, for my own enjoyment.

So much fun! And so tense! Much greater than the sum of its parts and very evocative of its subject matter. A lot of replayability packed into a small box. 

Great art and components. 

Has never failed to deliver an exciting game. Every game plays out differently. Bumping it to a 10 because of this and because the included variant is a lot of fun, too.

RATING: 8
First of all i consider this game a filler.
It has very good pieces and drawings and it features a large colorful but rather simplistic board.
It is very good as a game though and i highly recommend it to chess or stratego enthusiasts. There is a lot of bluffing and second-guessing in the game and the good thing is that it remains balanced. 

I haven't played the advanced version yet but i suspect that something is wrong balance-wise with the draft and advanced versions.

update: the advanced/draft version spices up the game and provides replayability.

RATING: 10
I got this on a whim as my 3rd game in my collection, but the fact that it has outlasted so many other games and still sits near the top of my top 10 list means it has something really special going for it.

PROs
- It is simple to learn and teach, and easy to setup.
- There is NO luck in this game. You know all the resources your opponent has (and vice versa), and thus you know a victory/loss in any way is a result of your play and nothing else.
- There is a decent amount of depth packed into this game, all the more amazing considering how fast it plays and how simple the rules are.
- The theme is awesome and one of my favourites.
- The components are amazing, from the plastic holders to the cards and to the artwork. It really helps to immerse you into the game.

CONs
- People expecting a super meaty game will be disappointed. But that's not what this game is anyway.
- The large cards makes finding the right sleeves difficult.

And that's it! I really love this game, and can't get enough of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great components! For this type of game I slightly prefer Field Command, just because of theme, elegance and greater movement scope. I'm not a huge fan of fantasy settings/battles otherwise I'm sure this one would be my favourite. I'm more of a military man. 

Asymmetrical powers always have me suspicious the first few times I play them. I feel like I need to understand both sides' capabilities and how they interact before I can comment on this one fully. 

Loved all the individual powers of the characters and text cards. Movement though felt a little limited as a lot of characters could just plod forwards on a small battlefield. Special card powers went someway towards helping that but it didn't feel enough on first sitting.

Looking forward to playing this one more.

I picked this edition up by happenstance and figured it would just be a larger version of the small Kosmos 2er edition I already had.  The production quality is a step up, but I was also surprised by the variants included in the edition.  The expanded character options results in a much wider range of re-playability.  Hence the bump up on the rating from the original.

One of the best 2-player games out there. This Knizia game captures the Middle Earth battle between Good and Evil perfectly. The game feels like a combination chess (special movement allowed for each piece), stratego and poker (elements of piece and card bluff).

Két parti alapján nagyon nem látom át, mit kellene csinálni, a pár mondatos szabály egy mély játékot rejt. Van benne rendesen szerencse is, de így is jó kis taktikai játék. Úgy tűnik, már a legalapabb változatban is nagyon sok parti van, a teljes játékban akár több 100 is. Gondolom Kniziát a block wargame-ek ihlették, elég hasonló az alapelv. Egy menet kb. 20 perc.

RATING: 7
Stratego, LordOfTheRings, Solo

The board and cards and characters are much larger.  I think I still prefer the smaller, more portable version.  But I do much like the new art and the new handicap cards; I may do some small expansion modifications for this.

This will probably go on the trade pile soon when I've finished making my private small travel set.  (Obviously I can't really make it available for the public.)

A fairly simple game that uses guessing, bluffing and faking-out as its main features, with your characters' identities hidden from your opponent as they move around the board. This is good fun in itself, but the real joy comes in playing consecutive games against the same opponent, where the mind games can really come into their own.

RATING: 7
The only complaint one may have of the game is the price.  I think it's too expensive for just a two-player game.  On that basis I bought, among other titles, a new version of the original -- and the retailer upgraded my purchase to the deluxe for free!

Achtung:  Many women hate this game.  Passionately.  It could well be the confrontational aspect.  This is the sort of game that the act of losing can be painful, even if you don't normally care who wins.

Rating is for the base game.  I haven't tried the deluxe changes yet.

Used to own the original but glad I upgraded to this newer version. Love the theme as I'm a huge LOTRs fan. Love that the game has a LOT of variability and tough choices to make. Love that it can be played in under 30 min. Easy set up and take down. There's nothing missing here. Loads of fun. This game will always be near to be ready if we have 30 min. left and need to finish up the night with a great game. Man, I haven't even tried out the variation characters or draft rules yet! Woo!

This game packs so many little interesting decisions and moments into such a small footprint and play time. The roles have interesting interactions and the management of the asymmetric resources is as deep as you want it to be. The theming actually works, as unlikely as that might seem. I have not played T&E but this is my favorite Knizia game. The app has given me a chance to see how the game is enjoyable at each level of competence one can develop with repeated plays.

The new characters have breathed new life into this already excellent game. Endless combinations are now possible with the two choices for each of the nine chatacters. I recommend not revealing the player's initial character choices, which adds tension to the game play. It will not be certain what end game victory conditions are being attempted with the new Witch King and Frodo's new ability to pass the ring to Sam. Makes for exciting game play. Played the initial release of the base game with only 9 characters for 68 plays, before acquiring the Deluxe Edition. After as many plays with the latter, Deluxe edition, it still provides excitement and pleasure that does not seem to diminish with the tactical and strategic choices available with each game.

RATING: 8
Came to the realization that with Summoner Wars, Vortex, Lost Cities, this wasn't seeing play. It fetched a nice sum so it was off to a better home.

Fun.  Love the double-guessing element and the ability to psych your opponent out.  Have not played with the expansion characters as the base game still has TONS of mileage in it.  My only slight gripe is the setup seems rather scripted; I feel like I've found the optimal one for each side and don't see much of a reason to change.

Also, it's tough to play against a novice - familiarity with the characters and their powers is absolutely necessary to play competently, making for one-sided affairs unless both players have at least a few games under their belts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
WOW! This is without a doubt one of the most fun 2-player games I have ever played. It's got this great vibe; you spend your first game learning how the mechanics work, and then you want to play a dozen more games immediately, to try every single different strategy you can think of. The game only takes about 10 minutes to play, so it's incredibly fun to get in a best-of-3 (or 5!) match before moving on to something else. Really a tremendous game, one of Knizia's best efforts.

Deluxe Edition Update: Still one of my very favorite 2-player games. Deluxe edition just adds more replay value (and better art if you ask me).

Solid game, and seems like it could be interesting to explore more thoroughly. However, since our first game it has never hit the table again. It fills an odd niche of being less streamlined and elegant than the majority of abstracts in our collection, but much less sprawling, thematic and deep than the more epic two-player games in our collection. Seemingly, whilst giving an initial impression of being a solid game, this one is just overshadowed by the many other two player games in my collection.

Hidden units, battles consisting of attack base + card play (rather than dice) remind me of block war games like, Wizard King or Hammer of the Scots.  Plays like a streamlined block wargame.

This game feels tense when you play. Very tense. The game is short, very few turns, and in those turns you have to do the best you can with very little information as all the opponent's pieces have hidden identities and when you play your cards, you play them simultaneously. Those two qualities, number of turns and hidden information, produce a delicious tension that starts almost right away and continues right up until the end.

As always, there are some people who may be wary of playing a lotr game, and I understand completely. The game has done nothing regarding the idea of good being a bunch of rich white men and evil being, largely, tribal savage people of colour. Heck, they even gave the ability to kill the Witch King to Merry (a man) when in the books it was a woman who killed it.

So, yeah, the game is problematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun two player Stratego variant. Loads of tension. This game really shines when you can get the same person to play with you frequently so you can each understand all the little subtleties of the different characters and how they interact. The Deluxe Edition is like having multiple games in one box.

I wish I got to play this one more.

I picked this up for my husband and son to play together.  They still play Stratego sometimes, so I thought I would upgrade them to something better.  

I can see this is a good game, but it's not my type of game.  I don't enjoy games that require me to guess what the other person is thinking.  Oh...okay....I basically suck at games like this. :)  

My family loves it, and I knew they would.  I rate it a 7 in terms of my desire to play and they rate it a 9, so I'm giving it an 8. It probably deserves to be higher, since it's surprisingly short given its complexity, so it may go up with repeated plays.  (Based on 6 plays)

I like LotR: The Confrontation, but I don’t love it, and as I rarely play 2 player games, it won’t hit the table too much as it must compete with great games like Summoner Wars, Commands & Colors: Ancients, 1960: The Making of the President etc. Yes, the gameplay does give you some sort of Stratego-vibe, but it’s much better than Stratego. The decisions you need to make are much deeper and there isn’t as much luck as in Stratego and LotR doesn’t rely as much on memory.

What I really like is that some units can kill other specific units, and the combat which is based on card play is very neat! The extra special cards really add something to the game as well. You need to outthink your opponent and sometimes bluff. Near the end of the game, though, the game becomes a bit “la-la” as you know which characters are left and probably where they are. Still, the way the game can end in different ways for the two teams is always something I enjoy. Good, but not great game.

RATING: 3
The new characters add replayability but overall I prefer the original for it's compactness and portability. I assume the size of the new box is to justify the grossly inflated price tag. This game could just as easily have been produced in a box the same size as the first or even as a £5 expansion to fit in the original box. At least they could have come up with a more attractive/authentic looking map and less tacky looking stands.

Its hard to know where to rate this one. I think the original game is a masterpiece...maybe a 10 for me. The expansion has nicer components, but some of the new roles seem out of whack.

This is a great theme-drenched game.

Updated after the release of the Deluxe Edition.   Perfectly designed two-player Stratego variant.  Probably the best two-player game I own, it's just amazing to play with another experienced player.  I bought this thinking it would be just a little filler that might get played a couple of times but my game partner and I played it literally 17 times the night I bought it.  The Deluxe edition is a must-have for experienced players if only because it introduces some interesting variations without altering the gameplay.  The new and variant characters change the game in subtle ways and mixing them up makes for some nice surprises, particularly if you've played the original game into the ground.  The art and production are better overall- an absolute classic in every sense of the word.

I'm giving this an 8 because for a two player game its one of the better ones in my opinion. A lot of the two player games seem just so so. Therefore when you get a good one it deserves high praise and perhaps a better rating than if it was compared straight across to a good 3-5 player game.

One of the best two players abstract games, involving both strategy and [u]bluffing[/u]. It has a chess-like feel, but with asymmetrical forces and objectives, hidden information and card play, short set up and play time, nice theme. The two sets of characters and cards in this edition (including a drafting variant) increase the depth and replayability. The complexity comes from learning and using the individual powers. It uses a combat style similar with [i]Dungeon Twister[/i].
It is possible to adjust the strength of one side, flipping one character's tile with the variant version.
I don't like the tile's graphics, some are confusing.

Worked so hard to introduce this one to the wife correctly.

We watched the movie series together, which she loved.  Checked out the first book in the series which she is currently reading.  Created easy to understand player aids.  Read and re-read the rules to ensure I understood the game front/back.  However, at the end of our first game she said....  "That's it?"  "A glorified game of Stratego?"

My wife wanted something epic.  This game is not epic.  She enjoyed the story so much that this game could not fill the thirst for Lord of Rings that I had created.

Myself on the otherhand, enjoy this game quite well.  I think the theme of the game goes well with the story line.  I'm scrambling now to play the Lord of the Rings co-op game next and may revist this one with her afterwards.

Oct 2011 - My kids are starting to play this one.  Excellent.

Wonderful version of this addictive game. Box design is problematical ("stupid" might be a better description...) with no way to completely store all included components (counters), and cardstock quality is less than I'd hoped, otherwise this would be closer to a "9" for me. I'd also hoped for a revamp of the (for me) unattractive board design, but others seem to like it. Nevertheless, this remains a great game, and this version is definately the one to go for.

This is hard to rate.  I've played the original game many times, and rate it a 10.  Having played this version, I'm now not even inclined to take the copy I had bought out of the shrink wrap.  The game is still fun, and I like the new characters, but I hate the components--the wobbly too-tall stands, the too large box.  I'd recommend that anyone interest in the game buy the original.  Except for the person who wants to take my copy of the deluxe edition off my hands. :)

Very exciting, but can also be occasionally very frustrating. A lot of replay value, but also a high learning curve. It's definitely worth it to learn to play well.

Among Knizia's games, it's very thematic without too much calculation.

One of the best 2-player games, and probably the most exciting one.

RATING: 7.5
Every time I play this game I love it. It is fast, in-depth and thematic as well as fun.  Much better than stratego due to the use of cards and logic.  Anybody can kill anybody through clever card play, so yo can't run in there with your big guy and expect to hack it up.

Stratego with variable player powers and hand management.  Simultaneous revealing of power cards and alignment-specific special cards create a cat and mouse game of bluffing and maneuver.  This is a great game.

Improves on the original. Compared to original its $20 more, and board is less transportable. Cant put in your backpack. But addition of new variant characters and even better artwork offsets that. True rating is probably a 9 or 9.5 , but due to the flunkies on here who rated it 1,2,3 and 4 ( which is impossible. Just punks looking to lower the rating) , I gladly will bump it to a 10.

RATING: 10
An outstanding, under-appreciated game. Virtually perfect in its design; relatively blow-out proof and yet no lousy rubber-band catchup mechanics. A new player can get lucky but good play almost always prevails. Lovely art, lots of variety. Fast, simple, and deep: I know of very, very few games that are those three things at once. Can be played casually or seriously. I have played hundreds of games of Confrontation and it is still exciting and fun. An absolute favorite. Do not even touch FFG's most recent version of the game, which shrinks the board and the components and destroys all the appeal of the art.

Don't buy it unless you plan to overhaul the rules.
----------
The game is extremely well crafted, and I was shocked when I heard what a great deal my friend got on it.  I was contemplating buying it before we even began reading the rules.  Then I played it.  We had to play a second time and decided the winner based on how many of Sauron's minions we managed to take out before being completely obliterated.

The game plays quickly once you have a feel for what each character's special ability is.

I'm not generally one for house rules, but this game definitely warrants them.

Reminds me significantly of Stratego, but the armies aren't balanced. Sauron's characters are very powerful, whereas the good guys have powerful abilities. And capturing Frodo is a lot more difficult then it would seem with his ability to retreat sideways. I look forward to more plays of this and exploring the depth and complexity of the game.

Comment re the original Deluxe edition - the additional size and production is unnecessary, but the alternative characters are interesting.

Comment re the newer down-sized non-deluxe deluxe edition - the resizing is a distinct improvement functionally when playing the game (and for storage), I just wish they would  have left the hero names on the pieces - remembering which Hobbit is which can be an issue!

The game itself is tremendous.

This is a suped-up version of the Kosmos 2 player game The Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.  The original was a very clever 2 player game, vaguely reminscent of Stratego.  This deluxe edition features the same basic game, but with huge (possibly oversized) pieces.  The game also features a second set of characters on the flip side of the original characters, allowing a second "variant" game to be played and now also a draft version.  You also get 4 extra special cards, two for each side.  I was initially dubious, but the variant game works very well and seems to be balanced.

A mix of stratego with shazzam. I think this is a great game. I love the theme to bits, I think this is slightly better/longer than a filler. 30-45 minute game for the basic game 45-60 min for the 'variant'. Easy to learn and easy to teach, I think this is quite a fun game.

On the plus side, everything is bigger.  One the downside, everything is bigger.  I do enjoy the new bits, and the variant game is an excellent new twist that requires new strategies.  The art is fantastic.  However, I miss the portability of the original.  The box is too big - it could have been about a third smaller and still held the board and  peices.  I think on the whole, I would have liked for the Deluxe Edition to be released in the same form factor as the original.  I must admit that Dungeon Twister has somewhat tempered my enthusiasm for Confrontation, as I find that DT has a similar feel and is overall more satisfying.  However, Confrontation has the advantage of being the quickest high strategy game that I own.

Stratego is a game that I love. Lord of the Rings is a setting that I love. So this is a game that I love. It takes Stratego and gives it flavor, gives it character.

I've played this game to death, on both sides, and am still having a blast with it. As I never played Stratego, the Stratego-esque play style feels quite fresh to me - all players know where every piece is at, but the identity is uncertain until an attack is initiated.

The Lord of the Rings theme is perfect for the context. The forces of evil's desperate search for Frodo and the ring, or the ambush of an unexpected enemy - it all feels right. Further with character abilities: for example, in standard play Gandalf is easily the strongest piece on the side of the Fellowship, while Frodo is adept at slipping away from danger.

RATING: 9
There's a lot packed in to a fairly simple ruleset here: hidden information, bluffing... reminds me of much bigger games like Netrunner, Fury of Dracula, and Sekigahara. Your opponent's options are finite - there are only nine pieces and nine cards per side - which makes guessing and second-guessing their moves the essence of the game. This also means the more you play with the same person, the more layers of bluff and counter-bluff get piled on - 'you did x last time, so I'll do y, but you know I know that so...' Looking forward to this becoming increasingly head-bending the more it gets played.

I used to play Stratego when I was young. Have fond memories playing Stratego. This is Stratego with a Lord of the Rings theme.

Update: Played a few complete games with all the new characters. It was quite different from what we were used to. It was like relearning the game since both of us wasn't familiar with the new abilities of each new characters in the deluxe edition.

You can mix the two groups too. So it add a nice variety of possibilities to the game.

Happy about the purchase even if I already owned the original version of the game. I want to play this game again soon.

Well, I like the ability to custom build my own force (like Dungeon Twister.) And I like the slick, new artwork. The stands and cards are all first rate, though the markers for keeping track of your opponent's forces are too small to be of any use. I'm just not convinced that it's a better game. Seems too easy to build a stronger white band. And killing Frodo off so Sam can walk in for the win somehow seems dishonest. Bigger, badder, just not sure it's better.

SOLD IT!

While I suppose the theme comes through in the game, the play of it (beyond the secret "Stratego" part) feels tossed together. It would be as if I took the game of checkers and gave certain checkers weird abilities and added the classic card game of War to the checker 'battles'. In the end you get a jumble of silly factors detracting from what would of been a cleaner (though less fun) game of checkers.

Generally speaking, games with bluffing and hidden information aren't really my thing.  That said, this is a very well designed, very tense game.  I've played it about 10 times, and my rating may rise with more plays; we'll see how it settles out.  

7/6/2010 - after 20+ plays, and exploring the variant characters a little bit, this is definitely moving up a notch.  My wife is starting to enjoy it more, too, so hopefully I'll be getting some more plays in soon!

4/27/2016 This is really a fantastic little gem of a game. Not my style at all, but somehow still wonderful - almost chess-like. Unfortunately, my wife only wants to play it occasionally.

This is an asymmetrical light strategy game similar to Stratego. This is my go-to strategy game for two players, you can play 2-4 games in about an hour. Even though one side is more powerful than the other, a balance is struck nicely by the Fellowship having easier victory conditions. Many matches have a nice level of tension, which I appreciate in a strategy game.

To me this is a tight, minimalist wargame with exciting card play. It balances the special powers of the units, the layout of the board and the flexibility of the cards perfectly.  It's also fast, small and full of options.    The card management is the best part of the game, allowing you to save the characters you want to save but at a cost.  At times it boils down to rock, paper scissors guessing which keeps it a light, fun game for me.  

Note:  The last time I played this we played at least five times in a row and finished at 2:30 in the morning with lots of laughs and fun.  This really is a great little game!

Always tense, extremly streamlined, theme very good integrated in mechanics and short play time, incredible replayability in the deluxe edition, all for a relative low price.

This is boardgaming in perfection.

PS: Playing both sides once per match to determine winner is a must. Since it is a little harder to win with the frodo side - but this is meant by design NOT an unbalance!

Love the tension! Conflicts often come down to 50/50 success trying to second guess your opponent with your card play.

RATING: 9
Simple to pick up. But don't let the seemingly simple premise fool you. There is enough strategy there to keep it extremely interesting still after many many plays.

Sadly we found the variant characters a little lacking. But this is a slight niggle to an otherwise great game.

Along with Jaipur, one of our most played and most loved games.

2nd best theme of all time (Star Wars being first, obviously GOSH)!?!
My wife will play with me, and the mechanics and character powers are very fun.  Nice and short, but very interesting decisions and bluffing.  Has the Game of Thrones card play mechanic where you add your card's value/ability to the fight after revealing character strength.

The new characters really change the feel of the game, and draft mode gives the game a lot more replayability.

RATING: 9
PROS:
-Se aprende enseguida
-Al contar con piezas de cartón que se insertan en la base de plástico, el juego no se inutiliza si una de las bases se marca en el dorso
-Permite combinar las piezas y diseñar una estrategia propia en cada partida
-Partidas muy cortas
-Las habilidades de los personajes están muy bien equilibradas
-Cuenta con un efecto psicológico muy interesante en el uso de las cartas de combate

CONTRAS:
-Solo pueden jugar 2 personas
-Bastante caro

--I didn't think I would like this as much, after all why mess with a good thing?  After two games of the "Variant" though, it's obvious this adds some nice, fresh blood into the game.  I think I will end up liking this just as much as its non-deluxe older brother.

RATING: 6.824
This game is good, and should not be dismissed because of the regular comparisons with Stratego.  To say It's Stratego-like is to say that if a table has four legs then a greyhound is a table. The theme connects with the plat; each piece behaves like the character.  A nicely balanced unbalanced forces two player game. However, the game only seems to really work if you can find a similarly minded person to play it with (ie someone attached to the theme), otherwise it can get a bit dry.  Rating is for when you play it with the right person (14/12/08). UPDATE: Unfortunately, the right person moved away, so archived (rating dropped from 8 to 6) (17/9/11). UPDATE Really got to find someone else to enjoy this game (Rating 6.824, Jan 17)

RATING: 8
I like LOTR: Confrontation for several reasons.  The game play has a good mix of theme and abstract mechanics.  Each character piece has its own set of moving and attacking guidelines, somewhat akin to a game of Stratego or Chess.  The theme is executed quite well.  The Tolkien world is illustrated very nicely, and the special moves for each character align somewhat with their role in the LOTR story.  The games are short and the instructions easy, which make it a good game to pull out for newbies or in short times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game!  The variants spice things up from the original, and the originial is still a classic.  Another brilliant game by the good doctor.

UPDATE:  This game continues to delight.  The strategies, and the changes in the layout forced upon you (either by opponent's setup, or casualties in battle) make for a game that never seems to tire.  My only complaint is the theme.  Although I personally have no problem with Tolkien, I know gamers who would love this title yet avoid it simply because of the franchise involvement.  I also would like to chime in on the ongoing debate whether this is just Stratego.  There maybe similarities but the design of LOTR: the Confrontation turns whatever the Stratego engine offered into a truly well concieved multilayered gaming experience.

RATING: 8
Fun Stratego-like game.  The combat system, the various powers of the units, the map layout and the victory conditions are all spot-on.  Captures the theme well.  A good  guessing and bluffing game with a well integrated theme. I am disappointed in the Deluxe edition... I was hoping that the text would be larger and easier to read.  So, I traded my copy off.  I will make my own edition from scanned graphics... with LARGER text!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
This plays a bit like constructed-deck card games like Blue Moon.  Each side is balanced with respect to the other, but the strategies to play well are very different.  The Sauron characters and cards are the 800 pound gorilla in this game--they can lumber forward and squash the Fellowship without too much thought.  The Fellowship player, on the other hand, has to squeeze the best from the team like you wouldn't believe--the character values are dwarfed by the opposition, so you have to get Gimli, Legolas, and Merry to knock off the Orcs, Flying Nazgul and Witch King, respectively, because you don't have the muscle to do it any other way.  I can tread on the hobbits and friends to win this game, but I have yet to figure out how to finesse a victory with the good guys.  Damn you, Knizia.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Knizia at his best, this is quite an elegant game!  

The pacing is amazing since each round players must move forward along a directed graph; we played it 4 times in 90 minutes during our first sessions.  The asymmetry of the game is laudable in that it makes the game fresh and interesting while strongly supporting the theme, and seems well balanced so far.  The variant looks really interesting too, it's a neat way to add a refreshing quality to the game.

RATING: 6
Immensely satisfying given its short play time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[b][i]Lord of the Rings Confrontation[/i][/b] is a quick thinking game of bluffing and deduction. The best part of this game for me is that it has a shelf-to-shelf time of 30 minutes (in other words it takes 30 minutes total to set the game up, play, and put it away) and yet it doesn't feel like a filler game. Rather Confrontation has the same tension, strategy, theme, and fun of a much longer game. The only thing keeping it from greatness is that after a few tens of plays it starts to feel a bit repetitious. The variety included in the Deluxe Edition delays this for ten more plays or so, but it's a bandage, not a cure.

That said I can heartily recommend any game where my biggest complaint is that it's "only" good for 30 plays (especially at this price point).

[b]Deluxe vs Standard:[/b] As the word "deluxe" suggests, the deluxe version is clearly better than the standard version. It contains a mini-expansion to the standard version by adding a few extra options. And, although I think the Standard game has the best of the Deluxe box, the Deluxe extras are sometimes appreciated.

If I had to choose the most popular game in our house there would be no competition. This is it. My son has been playing since age 5. He's now 12 and would still rank it in his top ten.

RATING: 7
It's beautiful. It's inventive. And it's strong on theme. But to know every possible tactics combined with every character it would take a few dozens of plays in every possible combination. After that you could say that you play consciously.

In my opinion it's redundant and unnecessary - the basic game was good enough. Sometimes less is more - this is the case.

For some reason, I never feel like playing it. Nicely assymetric though.

Update: while I'm still not overly fond of this game, my son pulled it from the shelf one day (I assume because of the box illustrations) and he really likes it, so the game is now seeing the table a lot more often.

My opinion on this game is still pretty low, although this does add more variety in comparison to the regular edition.  The artwork is better on the whole, but the game feels over-produced in size, with no real upgrade in quality of components.

RATING: 9
This is a wonderful mix of great mechanics (a bit of chess-like movement with hand management and unique character powers) with bluffing, tension and theme. Game plays really fast, but is deep enough to keep both players engaged. I have not even tried the alternative character set and I still think the game rocks.  If you have heard Reiner Knizia makes dull, dry, mathy games - just try this one.

An excellent game that offers a lot of enjoyment with extremely simple rules. No luck here, just strategy and bluffing. It plays quick, and you will want to play another game after finishing one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game plays best with the drafting variant, and when you don't know which characters your opponent chose.  Makes you wonder what strategy you will have to deal with each game.

On the other hand, it's still fun to play classic style, variant style, or draft style.  The strategies change with each game type, which makes the replay value excellent if you ever get bored with just one version of it, which is tough to do as that requires a good portion of plays.

I love the seemingly simpleness of the game - yet the complexity of strategy really reveals itself over time. I've only played the variant version once, but it's clear that it plays like an entirely different game. Two (actually, three with the draft variant) games in one!

Ok I've played 3 times now.
After a couple of matches the game plays very fast, but it is a deep experience filled with tension and delight... and you seem to realize there were good moves to make only too late. Gave it an "8".

Still playing the basic game without special cards. I've played around 10 games now, it seems very well balanced. Gave it a "9".

RATING: 7
An excellent asymetrical 2 player game that blends tactics and strategy very well. Creates a tense experience for both players (more so for the Fellowship side) where each choice is significant and often agonizing - all in a short amount of time (30-40 min). Have yet to play the variant. Highly recommended. sleeved

UPDATE: Upping my rating after many games against the same opponent. The guessing and calculated risk-taking is delightful, and I´m getting better. Seems the good guys are stronger when both players are experienced.
------------------
Better than the original game. Too bad I´m so lousy at bluffing. Still plays fast. New characters give some extra spice and variety, but the tarot cards are oversized stiff cardboard and should have a better finish. I do like the new artwork on the characters, though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Confrontation builds up much faster than I realize. Both players are very timid at first trying to suss out each other's units. Once the first few pieces are captured, moves accelerate rapidly in a pleasing arc. It does a great job at allowing both players, winner and loser, to feel satisfied after a game. I have played a second match immediately after every game played so far. Moreso than most games, in Confrontation, you are playing your opponent directly. I prefer the base card set over the added ability cards.

A really good strategy/bluffing game, lots of replayability for such a simple ruleset. Bought it on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. My wife doesn't like it though, although she loves confrontational games (rutinely kicks my ass at Battlelore). She doesn't like that she has to remember all those special powers. In the end it means that the game doesn't get played as often as I'd like...

This game is a huge improvement over the original.  It adds so much depth.  It is full of strategy and only takes 20 minutes to play.  It is short, compact (I made it travel sized), fun, and has enormous depth.  I once spent three straight hours playing this game over and over again.  I expect that I will love it for ever.  My main gripe (minimal) is that FFG decided to make it non-travel size.  I solved that problem by combining the two editions. (travel size with deluxe pieces)

It's amazing how well such a relatively abstract set of rules manages to grasp the feeling of the LotR books (and later movies). The character's abilities are quite close to the source, and the few rules concerning River Arwen and the Tunnel of Moria make the story really come to life.

I played this with my wife for the first time, and we managed to get four plays in in that one Sunday. Quite a feat, considering it was her who requested two of the play-agains. That's rare, and bumped up my rating quite a bit, right into the top 10. It has dropped a bit since, but not much.

Great game!I have played it a lot. If someone tells you that Knizia is done, invite him or her to play this game. How can a game be light and deep at the same time? This is the answer.  Sauron is hard to beat, is awesome to play him. :-) Para dos jugadores. Lo comparan con Stratego pero es mucho mas. Cada jugador tiene 9 personajes que debe mover en Middle Earth. La hermandad es escurridiza, las huestes de Sauron son agresivas. Lo sobresaliente del juego es el manejo de las cartas en los combates. Una vez utilizadas salen de juego y eso revela algo de (y a) tu oponente. Tenso, divertido y rápido.

My feelings about this game are about on par with the base game (no surprise really).  I found Wormtongue to be absolutely annoying with the gameplay otherwise being almost identical to the original with minor trappings.  In the end, I still think the game lacks the scope to make any meaningful strategies and ends up taking a hit in replayability.  Maybe Dungeon Twister has turned me off from the whole 'play a value card simultaneously to resolve battles mechanic.'  I just don't see what everyone else does I suppose...

I'll leave this shelfed for some time and try it again in a few years.  Maybe it will be better accepted then.

Mar08: I traded down for the original edition.  I actually like the size better.  Brought it out the other day and enjoyed it a lot.

If I played this often I may break that barrier that doesn't make me want to play it immediately after I'm done. For the record I have never won a game (played 5 or 6 times so far, playing either side).

I do find it very clever and interesting, but...

RATING: 8
This is a wonderful, light quick game with good depth. This two player game focuses on special power characters positioned with Fog of War.  Many people dislike special powers in games because of the added complexity.  I almost always love them because of the variety they add to the game.  The only exception is a game like Hera & Zeus- where the physical design of the game/cards makes learning the special powers difficult.  However, games like this one, Jambo, Magic, do it right by having the special powers explained with text directly on the components.

The added variety of the deluxe edition which includes both the base characters and alternates garners it another half point over the original (which I also rate quite highly).  Note: I've recorded my one play of the alternate game under the base game because I consider the deluxe version to be an "expansion" for games played purposes.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.34
One of the best 2 player games. Not just good because of the Theme, actually a great strategy & deduction fight/ and or escape game based on well designed asymmetrical but  balanced good versus evil character skills. The Deluxe version adds new players over the basic version and is highly recommended! TOP#16
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Although new look/quality is better than in the original game, it's worth buying mainly because of new versions of characters...  They _really_ enhance the replayability creating a potential for many variants and possibilities to explore.

Definitely recommended once you've mastered the base game (or just instead of it).

The same game as the orginal but with twice the characters and some added cards so I had to buy it :P Not crazy about the bigger box though... Have not yet played with new characters to comment, will update.

Original comments:

Very nice spin on stratego with the added theme, tons of special abilities and magic and such. The theme is really well implemented as it is part of the gameplay and true to the story. 

Great 2 player strategy game, good value for the price, FUN and only about 20 minutes to play.

I can't think of a game with a better combination of theme/time-to-play/strategy/tactics/bluff/tension. Maybe Quebec 1759? Not the least little bit dry, yet not lucky in the normal sense of the word.

If you call yourself a gamer of any type, you gotta play this one.

The slightest of nitpicks:
-- A bit too much of needing to know all of the characters' abilities and the cards. Well, the 5 card is easy enough, but the texty ones aren't completely intuitive.
-- Again with the LotR theme (even though I love it, c'mon.)

Wow. After playing a couple of games with just the variant characters (both Fellowship and Sauron), I found the Deluxe Edition even better than the original. I have no complaints of any significance. The very few minor production quibbles (such as the placement of the numbers on the cards) did not detract from my enjoyment at all.

RATING: 7
I half-jokingly described this as the half-orc spawn of Stratego and War, but it is a very good game - probably my favorite Knizia game. I'm tempted to tinker with the special powers of the characters and create my own variants.

RATING: 9
***THE CLASSIC GAME***
Probably my favorite game with no random element (except PR). There is a lot of hidden information, however. This game is fun, plays fast, has a lot of strategy, but the thinking never gets bogged down or too intense, because there is a lot you don't know anyway. Knizia seems to be able to produce wonderful games that rely on intuition, rather than outright strategy. You really have to second-guess your opponent here.

***AND SO MUCH MORE***
And just when I started to get the hang of things, I succomb to the variant game; there is just so much to love here. This game is not only great, but it seems to have countless possibilities as well... Upgrade to 9!

At first, when I tried this game I was very disappointed. It seemed very simplistic, but after a couple of games I see I couldn’t be more wrong. This game is surprisingly complex in its game play, every move has a deep consequence in the game, you have to think a lot and think ahead as far as you can, also it creates a lot of stress and tension in me (which is a good thing). When I finish playing this game I feel drained but satisfied and often, for a couple of days, I find myself thinking about the moves I did wrong in the previous game. If you like brain burners you are sure to like this game.

It´s been years since I last played LOTR: The Confrontation, but I finally did it this month. I can say I still love it, one of my favorite Knizia games. All I wrote before still holds, but I’m downgrading its rating so my feelings for the game match BGG´s ranking system.

I still have to explore the draft variant, the alternate characters (I have only played with them once) and the extra cards.

Bottom line, LOTR: The Confrontation is a good game I want to play often.

Excellent game. 

The variable character powers, the cards used to resolve combat (and the special one-off cards too), and the twist of playing on a diamond shaped board (wide in the middle, narrow at the ends - looks like a gamer, in other words!) raise this above the Stratego on steroids that it might at first seem.

The play gets better when you know the character's abilities and how to expoit them. The two sides have different stengths and weaknesses, and play very differently.

Great two player fun which remains fresh after many plays. Lots of bluffing, with a bit tactical strategy. It takes thinking to win because of the crafted card powers--respect to knizia. The first complicated game I was able to play with my six year old. (He gets two special cards). He plays Sauron and always wins. This game fails my simplicity and elegance rule, but it's good enough I overlook that. Moved from 8.5 to 9 cause still tense and fun after several years.  I'm continually amazed how tense the end game is--with almost a chess like feel.

I really liked Stratego as a kid, and this is basically a more interesting evolution of that game.

It's fun, and more thematic than Stratego, but still pretty abstract.

RATING: 5
Stratego type game with special powers and combat cards. Far fewer pieces and a much tighter board than Stratego. I like Stratego, I think it is one of the better classic boardgames. The Confrontation puts a lot of Euro-Style constraints on maneuverability and adds American-Style special powers and combat. However, I enjoy the maneuvering more than the special powers and combat, so this version actually weakens what I like and focuses on what I care for less. This leaves me with not a lot to love. I can see why some would love this game, but it is not for me.

I know when a game has a theme that I'm really into I become really easy to please, but regardless of the awesome theme, this is just Stratego made way over-the-top better.

RATING: 10
An amazing small-box, 2-player only, highly thematic game!  Distilled down to a simple stratego-like system, this game is amazingly fun, tense, and strategic -- not to mention how exceedingly well the design aligns with and respects the source material in such great fashion.    

So. Well. Done.

  Loses a tiny bit for high-quality, but difficult (at times) to differentiate art on the Fellowship side of things (e.g. it can be difficult to tell the Hobbits apart and I'm so used to the movie depcitions of the characters that things like Legolas with dark har or Aragorn with short hair throw me off... -- I realize that this is squarely my fault, though). Otherwise, near perfect execution.

This will never leave my collection and deserves my highest overall recommendation.

Update:  This is a close to perfection as it can get.  Stands the test of time.  I ALWAYS have a great time playing this.

What can I say, I'm addicted to this game!  Since a young age LOTR has been pretty much my favorite work of fiction, so I'm very much into the theme.  The presentation of the game is a thing of beauty, from the carved character stands, to the character art (a refreshing departure from the movie portrayals), to the stunning power cards.  The gameplay is wonderfully tense.  I've played 8 times and still feel like I'm barely scratching the surface of strategy, and this is still with the original characters - I very much look forward to the alternate characters and the additional special cards.  The character abilities fit wonderfully with the theme.

This game is the most elegant design I can imagine to abstract the Lord of the Rings trilogy down to a 20 minute bluffing game.

Since I prefer deep theme only with deep strategy, I really love this game.

RATING: 8
Excellent game for 2 players.  Beautiful components.  Nice to handle.  I held off buying this game due to the 'It's like Stratego' comments and I hate Stratego.  After a while, I took the plunge and bought it.  Rest assured, it's nothing like Stratego.  It's true that there are two elements found in Stratego - hidden pieces and one-on-one attack but that's where the similarities end.  Theme is great, not just pasted on.  Cards aid gameplay and battles fought.  The outcome of a battle is never assured until cards are played simultaneously.  The trick lies in drawing out your opponents good cards while not losing too much in return.  I love the 3 different modes of play - classic, variant and draft.  Classic pits a weaker/trickier fellowship against a stronger Sauron force.  Variant pits a stronger fellowship  against a weaker/trickier Sauron force.  Draft lets you draft in a mixture of characters from both the Classic and Variant modes.  It's these modes that give the game longevity.  I love it!! Very tricksy my precious.

RATING: 7
In just about every way I prefer the original version.  I am more used to the original characters, though nothing about the new characters suggests that it is unbalanced.  There's really nothing to be gained from the larger board and pieces.  The vertical layout is actually a little more annoying, as it feels easier to tilt the horizontal ones, and the tiles are inserted much more loosely in this version.  I also greatly prefer the artwork of the original edition.  Still, it's a very good game, and gameplay-wise, you could play the exact same game.  I would see no reason for people that don't own either version to not buy this one, but little impetus for owners of the original version to upgrade to this one.

stratego on crack.  the tactics of the different pieces posed a steeper learning curve than our interest in the gameplay.  thus, it got the boot.

Component-wise, this game is very much inferior to its predecessor. The huge box is mostly filled with air, the tiles constantly slide out of the holder, and it just feels clunky with the tall stands.

Gameplay-wise, however, this game really shines. There's so much more depth and strategy, and players can build "character-decks" to attempt different ways of winning the game. In this sense, its a much better game than the original.

If you're a Tolkien fan at all then do yourself a favor and pick this up. This is a brilliant reimplementation of the classic Stratego yet it feels incredibly thematic with Frodo trying to get to Mount Doom and Sauron trying to either find Frodo or destroy the Shire. With many additional characters, cards, and variants, I can see this one never getting old.

A fun and very thematic Stratego-spinoff. I love the asymmetric sides, and the hide-and-seek feel is a nice one. That being said, the combat system is not one I'm a fan of, and in a world of great 2P-games, this is enough of a knock on it to avoid it.

My comments for Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation would be virtually identical. The only real changes I would mention are 1) Deluxe has more options (each player can choose between 2 roles for each slot); 2) Deluxe is a much, much larger box - which bugs me. Overall I'd say there is a net benefit - unless you don't have a lot of room on your shelf.

Of course I love the theme!  The production values and artwork are excellent and really support this theme well.

You'll never want to play it just once at a sitting. You'll probably want to play 2 or 4 times, trading sides each time.

Each game you play seems to tell a new little story of how things might have gone down in Middle Earth.

Excellent game.

Thrilling struggle between the Fellowship and the Sauron. Surprisingly how well the theme can be included in such a simple game. Even if it based on Stratego is far better then its ancestor.

Stupidly good strategy game. It does basically everything correctly. Asymmetric factions (and even win conditions), vying for position on the field with both real and presumed threats, hidden troop movement and besting your opponent in combat. Light, clear rules, excellent production values, tons of conflict, uncertain outcomes but no dice. And it captures the flavour of the setting excellently on top of that. What is there not to like?

[2007.Dec 18] This Stratego look-a-like game--but not exactly Stratego-like--is another no luck offering by Reiner Knizia. Well integrated into the "Lord of the Rings" universe, this game requires a few plays to understand its nuisances. The deluxe version adds an entire set of additional characters to choose from guaranteeing hours of play.

RATING: N/A
The constant tension. The innumerable setups and strategies. The ever-evolving psychological metagame. The strong literary theme!

I really love the added characters and cards, and all the new combinations and possibilities to be found within the deluxe edition. However, I don't like the deluxe components quite as much as the originals. The box is unnecessarily huge with a lot of wasted space, the taller pieces tip over more easily, and the artwork is much weaker (as far as I'm concerned, nobody beats John Howe at illustrating Tolkien!). However, I just took the original game and souped it up with my own homemade deluxe paste-ups. Problems solved!

RATING: 7
It's a simple game 2 player game that plays fast with some strategy that does not burn your brain out. The new edition offers some additional replay value due to the fact that you have new characters and new cards. Sure more experienced players are advantaged in this game. The only 2 drawback is that the deluxe edition box is bigger than the original and many say that the game is broken and it's almost impossible for the good guys to win.

UPDATE: My first complain is the fact that there are exceptions to the rules in the base rules, and unit abilities and break exceptions, that break rules. Sometimes it can get confusing if you are allowed to do something or not.

The other problem is that when you have few cards left (3 or less), you can know for sure if you can win or not your upcoming challenges. Which is kind of pretty boring because you could know in advance that your next 3 battles will be lost. So why continue playing. This is why I added a variant that use dices to add uncertainty, but it offended many players.

Although I have played on this set, I have not yet explored the additional characters so I will not comment here except to say that I enjoy the base game very much (although I do like the smaller size of the original).

RATING: 9
Nice game, with both strategy and tactics.  This game revolves in particular around the following mechanics: special powers (both characters and some Combat Cards), combos (combinations of characters and/or Combat Cards), and hidden opponent characters (a la Stratego).

I appreciate:
- the variety of situations,
- the surprises (who is hiding behind this stand?),
- the feelings brought about by the game mechanics (crossing the mountains feels "physically" hard, as does letting Frodo cross beyond the mountain chain),
- the manageable tactical decisions (deep enough to be satisfying, not complicated enough to be daunting and impose any significant down time),
- the strategy that one can put in the initial placement, and in the general movement of the characters,
- the short duration of games (which allows players to switch sides and learn the other side of the game),
- the involvement and concentration brought about by the need to memorize your opponent's character positions (after they are revealed),
- the possibility of handicapping the more senior player (with Special Cards),
- the variety of possible character choices (in particular with the "draft" game).

And my son loves it, despite starting playing it at 7!

However, this game is too light for seeing the table much.  That said, it is very short (in the same category as, but only slightly longer than Hive, or Schotten-Totten), and probably gets better with time: one can learn to position intelligently their troops at the beginning, to learn the delicate interplay of special powers/texts,…  Thus, it is a less immediately accessible game than Hive, because subtle interactions create many situations that take time to master.  This also gives this game an interesting replayability.

Upon opening the box, I was disappointed with the components and the box itself. The box is way too big, in fact it is so big that the board slides around within the box. The components hardly take up any space and the insert doesn't fit the components very well. What were they thinking?

The box aside, I do like that they included two player aids and I like the backs of the player pieces (the eye of Sauron and the Tree of Gondor).

Regarding gameplay, I think the sides are more balanced in the variant than in the classic game. Unfortunately, the game is a bit confrontational for my s/o.

Traded.

I rushed to get this during the annual FFG sale.  I'm a Tolkien fan (although not a fanatic), and I was excited about the reviews.  However, she was not a Tolkien fan and found the movies incredibly boring, so I was a little apprehensive about trying it out.  Plus, it was fairly confrontational (no pun intended), and I wasn't sure how much she would enjoy that.

Surprisingly, she enjoyed it!  She liked the different special character abilities and playing the light an dark side felt very different.  Plus, it was short enough that the game was confrontational, it didn't feel too mean.  On the other hand, she's not a Tolkien fan, so I think that she is missing some better appreciation of the game and the character abilities.  I found the game very thematic, and although short, it packs a punch---the game is very tense and relies on just a few crucial decisions.  The movement rules make the game move inexorably forward---you can't just sit back and hide, as the game pushes you to attack.  There's a bit of bluffing and second guessing going on, some of which can be mitigated by clever cardplay.  Since it plays so quickly, it will probably see some action.

My thoughts on the original game: "Blind token movement combined with the best realized Tolkien theme yet, and you got Confrontation.  No luck and constant thought.  Amazing board.  The tiny Kosmos box is perfect."

Prettier board, prettier cards, better pieces, more options, more strategy, more fun.  I wish it was a tiny Kosmos box, tho'.

Played a few times.

Ken:
Lightweight, tactical gameplay.  Theme works and is well-integrated.  Quick-playing.  Comes with a nice variant to mix things up.  Memory component is shallow enough to not cause issues for new players.  Consistently close games.  Sold because we generally prefer War of the Ring for our heavier dose of Lord of the Rings, and the FFG LCG for a lighter game.  The LCG basically supplanted this one.  Still a great game.

Would love to play again.  Kathleen is not big on this, though, as she dislikes most games involving bluffing, so not a future re-acquisition.

RATING: 7
[Played 5 times]

Pros:
-) it can be used to play the original game;
-) new characters and cards adding variety.

Cons:
-) price tag (double than the orginal);
-) the big cards are very uncomfortable;
-) big box (neddlessly occupying room and losing portability) with poorly designed insert;
-) new artwork ("movie oriented").

To be determined (I'd need to play more to judge these):
-) balance of the new pieces? (seems decent)
-) draft rules? (seems poor)

Overall:
The original is my favourite 2-player game. The best merit of this edition is to be playable as if it were the old one, but it is overproduced (it's called "deluxe" for something, I imagine... but for me it's just more uncomfortable).
I'd stick with the original (but if I hadn't it, I'd be torn between opting for it - cheaper and nicer - or this - offering more options, even if of untested value). 
[Update: received as a gift. Definitely worse that the original.]

Absolutely fantastic, and Alysia liked it too. I love the mix of concealed units and bluffing with the openness of the discard pile and the brutality of knowing which pieces are perpetually out of play (having moved past your "front line"). Every bit as good as I'd heard.

It's basically a mix of Stratego and Lord of the Rings: The Duel, both two-player games I enjoy; Duel is one of my favorites. It mixes together a few different mechanics in very sharp ways, and of course the LotR theme is awesome.

Cleverly balanced, full of turn angst, and deceptively simple -- deceptively because the box size, the quality of the components, and the amount of exceptions and learning involved the first time around (when you're still getting down all the pieces, etc.) all point to a more complex game.

Very happy to own this game. Calling it a "minute to learn, lifetime to master" game is a tiny bit misleading. Every single character has a different power, and both factions have several special cards. And in order to really play the game properly, you should really have all that info in your head at one time, otherwise, you're missing out on some of the best subtleties in the gameplay. However, it is still very easy to learn. The asymmetrical gameplay is great too. Even the game feeling is asymmetrical. As the fellowship, you just feel like you have to be more cunning to win, whereas the sauron player just feels more like a bully and brute. Just ram your pieces into their pieces. I'd definitely highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good couple's game, or a fan or Lord of the Rings, or just a fan of a good game.

Excellent game. It's much bulkier than standard LOTR:TC, but this version is a more customizable. Sauron even gets his own semi-Frodo, and a military victory is much more likely. The 'a king revealed' card art is hideous.

I think the new characters, with some exceptions, make the game worse. Most of the time we use the standard set, and when we do switch we take only one or two of the new guys, most often the new Witch King.

Game in a Nutshell: Try to get Frodo to Mordor by taking turns advancing one character at a time. The other player tries to stop the fellowship. Every character has their own abilities and it's blind to your opponent what person you're advancing each turn until they confront in single card-driven battle.

Two-player, original game only.

Pros: There's few moments as good as letting your opponent sweat over which card to take, then follow it with a quick, calm selection of your own, and look them in the face with a big grin just to see how far you can send them into a scramble. The secret deployment and tons of different characters add loads of variety and great replayability. It feels as if the strategies possible is only limited by the creativity of the players playing. The game also runs fast enough that you can quickly play again if you lose quickly to an occasional spout of bad luck.

Cons: It might take a few plays to get a hang of the different character abilities such that the game is understood for its intricacies and moves at its intended pace. Because of that it makes this game tough to wrap casual gamers heads around so that they'd be willing to give it a try.

Other: After only a handful of plays, I'm already glad I have the Deluxe Edition to try out once I play the original format to death. I've tried this game with three different players (none who are gamers outside of playing with myself), and this has flopped with all (one is slowly gaining interest). I might even be bold enough to say this is the biggest flop of any game I've purchased to date (potentially because my expectations were too high). A possible recommendation is playing with the same side from game to game, rather then switching, so that players can pick it up faster if they're new.

Best Use: A quick two player game of matching wits, not so much strategy.

This isn't a bad game, but it's Stratego with special powers. And some of the powers don't make sense in the context of LOTR.

It seems to be very well-balanced, the bits are attractive, the rules are clear and it plays smoothly. If you can get past the fact that it's not really a LOTR game and take it for what it is, it's not a bad experience.

But it's far from great. Probably not even good. Just okay for an occasional play.

One play.  Fun bluffing, card management little gem.  Played with the simple rules.  My fiancee whined prior to play as to "how long it will take".  Well, let me tell you, it took no time at all, which is a definite plus.  I thought it was very interesting how the longer you play the more each of you know about your opponent's pieces, and the more you know about what cards they have left.  We were just learning the individual player powers as we went, but I think it will only get better as we play more!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Everything about this game is impressive. The artwork! The theme! The pieces (deluxe edition= totally worth it)! The game design! 

The game is simple to learn and plays intuitively. Having each player's pieces hidden from the other creates great tension throughout. 

It plays in half an hour (easily 20 minutes with familiarity) and stays fun throughout the entirety.

In my book, its an all out two player masterpiece! Seriously, I could not resist using exclamation marks.

This is probably my only 10 - there are other games I like almost as much, but every time I play this game I'm just blown away by how well it works, how nicely the theme integrates, the balance ... everything, its just about the perfect game.  I just wish I could play it with more people.  G/F doesnt really like the theme, and feels that does make the game slightly harder for her to pick up...

RATING: 6
Pretty good game in the Stratego tradition. I seem to not get it though. I usually have trouble with games that use blind bidding with a limited set of strength bonus cards (also Dungeon Twister). I only want to play high enough to guarantee the win or give up and play lowest, but I think this is not clever enough.

Also, there aren't enough "pawns" as there are in Stratego for me to use my usual strategy of just feeling out the opposition by sacrificing pieces. Every piece is pretty good, and there are so few you can't afford to lose them.

I owned the original from the day it was released in the US and I have enjoyed it a lot.

It looks great and there is so much to explore.

I really enjoy the art of this version.  I have only played with the classic version of the rules.

The cards give the game a constant "second-guessing your opponent" feel.  This a very tense game and definitely gives a genuine sense of accomplishment to the winner.  The win is hard won, and quick.  The fast pace adds to the tension and the feeling that every moment counts.

Plays fast (20-45 mins), very entertaining, a bit deeper in strategy than you might think for such a 'simple' game.  Me and my wife were sure that the dark player had the advantage - but then a friend visited and beat me 5/5 times while he was playing the light side, so now i'm not so sure.  ...Who knows, maybe I just suck at the game.  In any case it's a lot o fun - I highly recommend.

OK game from Reiner Knizia. Based on the Stratego model whereby each player can see his own characters but not his opponents. Each character has a variety of combat and special characterists. Interesting gameplay but I'm not sure if it holds up that well to repeated plays.

RATING: 7
I love the basic game. This new stuff brings more depth. The new art is gorgeous, but I think I'll prefer the smaller version. The new stands tip over and aren't as handy as the old ones. Still, a very good game, definitely worth getting even if you have the old version. Try randomizing the teams, that's a fun way to play!

Suggest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Compelling strategic (and psychological!) complexity even without exploring the Deluxe options. Especially like that it is a short (10-minute?) game with substantial replayability, and a game that you have to learn anew with each new opponent: you win not by mastering strategy but by better guessing your opponent's moves than the opponent guesses your own.

Two dings, however: 1) the box is simply absurd -- so much wasted space! -- and 2) the head-to-head competitiveness of the game makes it substantially less pleasant than, say, Dominion, in which you are playing against another player only via the medium of the cards.

I must say I was a little disappointed at how little this offered relative to the considerably more portable original version, which is so cheap you'll have no problem gluing your own versions of alternate characters to the reverse of the ones that come in the game. Essentially, that's all this is, only bigger.

All kinds of genius. Awesome theming too!
We play with the two bonus cards. They add a few more options with the potential of the return of Gandalf.

I like that the winning condition for the Fellowship is one thing. Get Frodo to Mordor. It's simple and satisfying when you get Frodo to the end zone..

Balanced and clever game. If you like Lord of the Rings in any way and want a 2player second guessing strategy game that plays in about 15 mins or so try this one.

I only play with the original characters.

I think this game has been overrated by some people as more of a masterpiece than it is. However, there's no question that it is an excellent game. It has fast-paced elegant gameplay; easy to learn, life time to master. The game allows for huge amounts of skill, the only unknown information or "luck" is the opponents starting locations and there are no random generators. It's easy to play over and over again. It has a high level of tension and fun from moment to moment because of the decisive confrontations. It has the light fun of a Euro game but with a better emphasis on making the mechanics work for the theme than others by Knizia which makes it feel more like Lord of the Rings than it might have. The art and components are of top quality. The deluxe edition adds numerous new ways to alter and change the game through variants and such. It's a fun game that deserves pretty much all of the praise it's gotten.

It's similar enough to Stratego that if you only got this or stratego, you should go with this. However, if you really like the stratego elements of bluffing, and moving around unit types of different values, than stratego still has it's own sub-niche that makes it applicable. Overall though, this game perfects the elements that stratego just started.

Larger board, larger pieces, larger cards etc.
I don't like most of new characters as they seem unbalanced and less straightforward to deal with each situation.
Also graphic is very monotonic and hard to see which character is which.
Cards are lower quality (I guess this is not Kosmos&FFG, this is pure FFG) with no indecies. Box is well bigger than it needs to be....

I feel like this is the crappy edition and original is the refined deluxe edition.

Earns a point higher than the classic version of the game thanks to the new variant characters, which certainly bring a very different flavor to both sides.  Looking forward to experimenting with this more.

Solidified the 8 rating with further play.  The new powers change the complexion of the game quite a lot.  The choices of which versions to use when drafting a team are not trivial.  Fun stuff!

RATING: 6
A compact, fast-playing game of double-think. Also surprisingly well-tied to the literature. I think people give it a bad rap. It's a good time kill or filler for two if you're waiting for more players to show up for something else.

The Deluxe Ed. adds new characters which gives the game new life, but I miss the small footprint of the first edition.

What an amazingly balanced game.  You can't help but feel hopeless as the Shire player, yet somehow, against all odds, sometimes you can make it.  As the Mordor player, you have all this power at your disposal, but the enemy is so slippery, and just when you think you have him....  Great game.  Not flashy, and not one I play a lot, but still a great game.

Really like this one - definitely seems to be a game that gets better over time as you better learn the nuances and strategies to both sides.  Wonderful balance despite initial appearance that Sauron's stronger units should dominate.  Beautiful art and components.  New edition includes the variant characters, additional cards, and advanced rules so I can't see this getting old any time soon.  A ton of bang for the buck.  A masterpiece.

RATING: 8
Simple, but with so much variety. A lot of people say the theme is pasted on, and I can see that argument. But I really think the powers and the cards are matched up perfectly, such as Boromir sacrificing himself in battle.  My girlfriend and I love the variant and classic modes, but really the draft is the best way to play. Plus I feel like the combat presents itself for awesome choices with special abilities and the cards. There's a lot of depth, strategy and mind games which come into play with your opponent.

RATING: 8
Vastly superior to Reiner Knizia's co-op Lord Of The Rings game, and more streamlined than War of the Ring.

Even though Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation has been called a re-theme of Stratego, its an excellent re-theme. Confrontation is short, but gives all the feel of Tolkein's books. Unfortunately, the theme is so tied to the unit abilities that players not familiar with LotR may find things a tad confusing.

This reissue includes different characters and single-use action cards, which add variation to the standard game for veterans.

RATING: 6
Very interesting.  I read the reviews and thought I would really enjoy it.  After I ordered it and, having no one to play, left it on the shelf for a while, I began to have doubts.  It's just a themed version of Stratego, right?  Wrong!  The variety of pieces with the addition of cards makes for an intriguing time.  I got to play my nephew and our first few games were blowouts for the Fellowship [played by me] as he learned how to play Sauron.  He changed his strategy each game and by the fourth, blew me away.  We switched sides and I dominated as Sauron.

I can not believe the game is that lopsided, so I look forward to more plays to experiment.

Why this is not a 10:
-> The stratego nature of blind guessing gets old after a while - definitely not a play all the time game
-> The current perceived imbalance is disappointing and this game does not come to mind when suggesting what to play
+ I would not turn down a match at this point
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
All of the Stratego comparisons are valid, but this game is better for several reasons, not the least of which are theme and presentation.  It's fast-playing, easy to learn and offers an above average amount of strategy, making it good for just about everybody.

[b]Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]LotR: The Confrontation has completely replaced Stratego for my son and I. It is much quicker to set up and play, my son loves to play this game when we only have 20 or 30 minutes to fit in a game. LOTR Confrontation has varied ways to play (the Deluxe version has 2 sets of Fellowship and Sauron characters you can play with), and the card mechanic adds a great sense of tension during each battle. Best of all is the LOTR game and the theme shines through.[/i]

Very simple game amazingly tied to the Lord of the Rings story.  A brain-burner.  I'm wowed by the intricacies of the gameplay and the fact that it is very chess-like in its lack of randomness.  Yet another great LOTR game from Fantasy Flight.

The game tries to be thematic and suceeds, but while trying it gets a bit overcomplicated. You'll have to be commited to the game to play it. Casual gamers won't even bother.

Thankfully my brother likes it and the future of the game seems bright. We played stratego quite a bit when we were kids and this one is the perfect update.

I love the extra characters and cards of the deluxe edition. Great value for money.

As everyone says, the box should be smaller (preposterous box insert).

(Wife's Point of View: She hates strategy. I won't even try. She will leave before I even get to explain how Frodo moves)

RATING: 7
I really like how thematic this game is. People often cite Knizia with little to no theme, but I found a lot of the abilities on the characters to be very thematic. My only issue with the game is that the characters are tiny and look very similar at a quick glance. I miss the large pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent two-player game. A Knizia where the theme actually meshes with the mechanics. Fast set-up and quick to play but is full of tense decisions. A bit like Stratego but with more depth. There are also a couple of variants to add to the replay value. One of the best two-player games that can be set up, played and put away in under 30 minutes. The artwork is very good too. Simple enough for non-gamers, but a level of strategy that makes it interesting to the hardcore as well.

I loved Stratego growing up and this game fixes it with the rules and LOTR theme.  There's a lot of positioning and my favorite bluffing/outthinking your opponent.

I recently knocked it down a point due to being a two player game (which doesn't have wife buy-in), so my desire in getting it out has lessened.

I guess when you design this many games some of them are going to be great, but damn! This game is legendary. I would have rated the original a ten if I had never seen this edition, but now that I have, I can't live without it. Double your pleasure, here. I still haven't even used the special cards at all and the game is still making me salivate just thinking about it.

After my first plays, I had a lukewarm feeling about this game, but it's starting to grow on me. I haven't played w/ any of the variant characters yet, but I like how the base setup gives each side such a different feel. With a few more plays, I can see this going up a point.

It's a good game, just not a favorite, as it might be a bit too unbalanced (fellowship player mostly wins, but might be a personal occurrence). But it works to bring out and play when the mood strikes. Like a good version of Stratego, with a LotR theme. And it should be noted that the theme is well executed, really like that.

Like Hera and Zeus (Stratego) but the asymmetry is odd and detracts from the game (IMHO) I probably should have stuck with it and played the advanced variant which seems like it would be meatier and more symmetrical, but Hera & Zeus is more streamlined and my wife flat-out refused to play it again, so I sold it.

I grew up with Stratego as a kid, and this manages to outdo it. Great concept, 20 minutes or so of good gaming.

I have probably played this game more than any other game in my collection.  The quick set up and play time make this a really great game.  Have played traditional, variant characters, draft game, and blind draft game.  This makes for a ton of choices.
One compliant, the variant characters sem to tip the balance slightly in favor of the light side.  The gollum, aragorn, gandalf, and sam block makes it extremely difficult for the dark to attack.  The windlord card also provide a huge benefit for the light side

Wow this game is addicting.  It's so quick and fun that it's hard to play just one game.  The hidden characters make for some tense decisions.  I find the original characters to be slightly better, but it's fun to have the second set of characters to see how it changes the strategies.  It is really satisfying to fool the other person and pull off a surprise victory.

I bought this today on strength of BGG reviews, played it a couple of times using the classic rules and wasn't disappointed. (I haven't played any other version of this, so that's not a factor.) Wow, a Knizia game which is not only nicely balanced but where the theme actually comes through!

Very good. I confirm the same rate of the original. New characters are great and now strategies involved are many and deeper (but I have to play again to see if they're well balanced like the original ones). Endless replayability. The artwork is good but not so good as J.Howe's one. Only a bit too much expensive...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this kind of rare game.
A really meaty 2-player one that only takes 15 minutes.
At first, it seems like an abstract because of the overwhelming amount of choices and strategy but it's also pretty thematic.
As a lot of people has stated, it's similar to the old Stratego, but there are so many abilities and cards that can break the rules (and that's the gist of it) that feels very different.
Without a doubt, we prefer the draft version keeping the chosen characters hidden to the other player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Outstandingly well designed game. Rules are very simple and concise. Not a lot of extra powers or cards to read/understand. This makes focusing on the strategy very easy to do on even the first playing of the game. Additionally play time is fast on the game. Components and general theme/feel of the game are good as well.

RATING: 8
I have to rate this as good as the original 2 player game. I mean, you get two standard games in this edition, plus the ability to construct a non-standard draft team. However, that being said, the "charm" of the originial is a bit lost in this edition.  The new art is hit or miss (I'm not fond of the art for the fellowship characters, but I really like it for the sauron player's characters).  I somewhat miss the simplicity of the card art in the original (it's good here, but a bit busy).  I like the smaller travel size of the original...quite frankly the bigger board and playing pieces don't do much for me.  And the box...it is too big. It takes up a lot of shelf space it doesn't need to.  Frankly, if you're not a big Tolkein fan, stick with the original, smaller version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a quick play game (20 minutes tops) that does have some subtlety to its strategy. In most of our games either side could easily be the victor at the very end, regardless of how many pieces have been lost. A great "out guess your opponent" game.

Rating after 1 disappointing play: Stratego with several twists; not bad, but not great.  Unless you want to have TWO Aragorns, TWO Gimlis, etc, in the game, the LotR theme limits the pieces, and you can't really make a decent game of Stratego with only 9 pieces per player, even by adding the cards to it.  Much as I love the books, and would love to love anything based on them, this game ultimately fails its quest: to be fun.

Interesting 2-player game.  I've only played the basic game so far.  With the "deluxe" characters and the extra cards, there seems to be a high replay value.

RATING: 9.2
Players: 2
Time: 30-45 min. 

Each players has 9 characters on the game board. White has the 9 of the Fellowship (Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, etc.); Black has 9 characters from Sauron's army (e.g. Saruman, The Witch King, The Nazgul, etc.). Both start their characters on opposite ends of the board, but opposing sides can not identify their enemy's characters. Players move their characters forward; once two opposing characters meet, their identities are shown and a simple combat ensues in which one or both characters might be removed from the board, or characters might retreat if able to do so. The goal for White is to move Frodo across the board and into Mordor. The goal from Black is to capture and kill Frodo. 

Each character has different abilities - a player aid has reference to all these. Black has the advantage in pure strength (high combat ability), White has the advantage in movement and Magic.

Very great game. Its one that gets played frequently and won't get old any time soon. I enjoy the emergent gameplay and strategies. So far all my games have never felt old. I've yet to try the variant version, but am looking forward to it.

I like this (deluxe, 2nd) less than the original version! 
I think the old, wide stands were better with the text in them. (deluxe, 1st, was apparently huge and had the text). 
And most of the new characters are inelegant an/or boring and bland.

Every gamer's allowed a game or two that he ranks rather higher than it merits.  This is mine: I played tons of Stratego as a kid, and this recaptures the excitement of that without mimicking its occasional repetitiveness.  I do find that some of the alternatives are unbalanced (for example, old Aragorn is superior to new Aragorn, Gimli is superior to Theoden, and the Worg is superior to whatever's on the other side of the Worg), but my roommate and I would make sure all pieces got used by playing different draft variants (sometimes we'd pick our own pieces, sometimes we'd pick our opponent's pieces, and sometimes we'd do a draft variant where we'd take turns picking pieces of either side (e.g. if I was black, on my draft turn I could choose to use the Worg, or I could choose to force my opponent to use Theoden).

Very nice abstract game that feels like [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1917]Stratego[/url][/i] advanced.  Even as it may seem contradictory, the theme is really nice attached to this one, cause you really feel like living a [i]Lord of the Rings[/i] story.  After two games, one with the good guys and one with the bad guys, I'd say that it has some balance problems.  Looks like it is very difficult to win with the [i]Fellowship of the Ring[/i].  Nevertheless, maybe after a couple of games, when all players know the game well, this critic vanishes.

Takes [b]Stratego[/b] and nearly perfects it, if you forgive the comparison. It's truly fascinating how two completely different sets of armies - each with an entirely different feel and area of focus - can be so balanced. A slew of variants adds re-playability. One of the best 2-player games, really.

RATING: 6
This game can truly be fun with a rival, because you'll understand and react to each other's trusted strategies, and can eventually be confident enough to make best use of the variant and drafting rules.

I'm giving this game a lower rating than the original edition, because the variant design (not by Knizia) isn't very inspiring, and lacked the brilliant asymmetry (FP weak but wily, Shadow strong but strained) of the classic version. I'm also not too psyched by the new cards, especially since they aren't on the player aid. That, combined with having more cards to whittle down, means it is harder to deduce what card your opponent will play. And that huge box filled with air is just retarded. Love the portability of the original edition.

Original: 4+3
Deluxe: 3+3

If you like Stratego and/or Lord of the Rings, I'd bet that you'd love this game.  The gameplay is similar to Stratego, but with greater depth.

Always great to have more options and characters, so that is a plus.  (I majorly dislike the Sauron character that wins by getting to Shire; totally unthematic.)

This game plays like a fun, exciting and quick version of chess. Superb production values and I love the game even though I generally dislike anything LotR-related (I vastly prefer scifi and star wars nerdiness to fantasy and lord-of-the-rings silliness). I'll just list the master sets here, since I don't want the expansions to clutter the list here.

A great 2-player "Stratego-like" game set in the LotR universe. Very quick rounds make for easy setup and easy play.

Components are a huge step up from the old smaller box version.

PNP version - rethemed and redesigned by me. 

This game felt like everything I've ever wanted Stratego to be. I had a lot of great memories growing up with that game and this really brought back a lot of the same feelings.

Of course I loved the tension of advancing or attacking without knowing which characters were in front of me. But the aspects that really surprised me were that the strength of the theme and how important the spacial aspect of the game was. You really feel like you're in the LOTR universe. I love how the character abilities are in line with how they behave in the books. I also found that the unit placement and movement was crucially important and was really surprised by how much that factored in.

You have to really deduce as much as you can with the information you have. Keeping track of player cards and where units have moved is crucially important.

Can't rate higher than a 7 right now despite how fun it is because in the end, it still feels like you're just sort of blindly guessing for much of the game. I can see the rating going up to a 7.5 the more plays I get in though.

This is a really good tactical deduction game. The LotR theme works much better than expected. This is the deluxe edition so it has a lot of replay-ability do to the extra units. The card combat with the unit powers works well in keeping things balanced.

[FFG 2006 edition] Fantasy, Novel; secret unit, fighting} LotR:C is a strongly themed game. It fits the story very well. The rules are easy to learn but it takes time to understand the capabilities of each character. The 2-layer double guessing (character + battle cards) really shines! It is highly tactical - positioning, movement, card play and reaction are all important. It is the best Stratego variant games I have ever played. Highly recommended!

It is a challenging and engaging game.  It is enjoyable when you can guess the hidden characters of your opponent and remove them with the special ability of your characters right away.  Replayability is high and you cannot use similar strategies each game; otherwise, you opponent can win more readily.

It needs good bluffing and planning to win if you are playing the Fellowship. It's easier for the Sauron team to win.

The new characters aren't interesting enough.

The production quality is good but I don't think it's much better than the basic edition.

RATING: 10
My favorite 2-player strategy game!  Disregarding box size, artistic design, or other superficial measures, I am rating this as a 10 on content alone.  It's reasonably quick to learn and play; it combines great strategy with a great theme, awesome re-playability capacity, and provides tremendous overall enjoyment.  For its genre (two-player strategy game), this game is tops.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a very, very tense match of wits against the right opponent, with long considerations of which cards to play in battle (a cerebral Rock Paper Scissors challenge that I surprisingly like, considering how much I hate the RPS mechanics in many other games). Playing the Fellowship seems to be the easier of the two sides (at least in the classic game), which is a bit annoying but also provides a great "in" for teaching new people without trouncing them or throwing the game. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of this edition, since we've yet to use the variant characters or the extra cards; I'm looking forward to how much replay value this little game will be able to provide!  

P. S. I really like the production values on this Deluxe edition.  Sure, everything is larger than it needs to be, leaving the box taking up "big box" game space on the shelf when the original was much smaller, but I love the larger-than-life cards and carved-looking character holders.

This rating will seem harsh, but here's why I give it a 3.  I own the original and rate it an 8 or 9... I think it is a great game.  This game has everything from the old game, so it would seem I should rate it at least an 8. 

However:  This new edition simpy doesn't add enough to justify a purchase.  If you don't own the original, then go ahead and get this one.  Otherwise, my recommendation is to stick with the old game.

Additionally, this game is hideously overproduced - I don't want a bigger board or that huge box, or that big price tag.  The "draft" rules are unimpressive especially when compared to better draft variants on this site.  Overall, I was dissapointed enough to cancel my order, and I would recommend the same to others.  (If you thought the extra characters were great in Citadels, you might think this is worth a purchase.)

RATING: 6
Two-player game where the object is to move pieces depicting characters from the 'LotR' across a (smallish) board depicting Middle-Earth. One player controls the Fellowship, the other Sauron, and each character has a unique skill such as automatically defeating a certain opponent if they encounter them (their identity is concealed from their opponent until this point). The aim of the game varies for each player (Fellowship have to get Frodo into Mordor, Sauron has to get three of his followers into the Shire or defeat Frodo). Pieces can only be moved forward across the board and some thought has to be given into the best way of manoeuvring your pieces as you don't want certain characters to become isolated or to leave your home area undefended. It's difficult to employ a consistent strategy due to the identity of your opponents characters are concealed from you until you encounter them. This results in a lot of luck when moving your own pieces to attack opponents. There's some longevity provided by the different variants, such as being able to change the skills of each of the characters.

After my initial play I loved it! It had simple rules, but the strategy felt really deep. I liked how you have to move a piece forward every turn. The theme blends really well with the gameplay. It took us an hour to play the first game, but I imagine our second game will be much shorter now that we know the rules. I can't wait to play it again.

It plays like an abstract but is surprisingly thematic.  A fun, quick strategic game of card management, playing your hunches, and bluffing your opponent.

The variant characters and optional one-time-use cards should give this a lot of legs.

Enjoyed my one play quite a bit more than I expected. I'm usually not a fan of deduction games, but most of the information is in the open (cards that have been played, characters that have been killed) so you can actually make educated guesses quite easily.

Update: After a few more plays (of the newest FFG version) I can say that I love this game. I don't know what it is about the gameplay but I just really enjoy playing it. Maybe it's the surprise of going for an attack and revealing the characters then trying to figure out how to best handle the fight, or the feeling of trying to secretly position yourself for the perfect move to trap your opponent, or the asymmetric gameplay where you each have different goals. Great, great game.

Great 2-player game that stays tense the whole game no matter which side you're playing. Both players always seem to think that the other is going to win so each move and card play is made with the hope that it's a good decision.

After my first session, I'm very pleased with this little gem. I'm sure I'll only grow to like it more as I learn some of the nuances. Not to mention the variant version that comes with this edition.

This is a spectacular game of hidden pawn identity. I really like the asymmetrical balance between each side. The cards interact well together and the bluffing element dramatically impacts the feel and experience of the game. It plays quickly and is easy to learn. That's a lot of good coming from one game. I'll be holding on to it.

Rated 8 after one play.  There's a lot to love: simplicity of play, tension, wonderful marriage of gameplay to theme, and a TON of options I have yet to begin to explore.  The gorgeous components and huge variety make the deluxe edition look like a real bargain for the money.   

9/11/07: Up from 8 to 9.  Each game is short and brilliant and yet the narrative arc of the Tolkien trilogy is somehow communicated in the miniature story of each game.

I won't rate this because it's pretty much the same to me as the original. In fact, I prefer the original just from box size and stuff. I don't care much for the additional characters, but this does have nicer components. So it's kind of a wash for me.

PROS: A great game of hidden information with asymmetrical sides. There's a well balanced mix of strategy and forecast VS. luck and chance (because sometimes you just cannot know what card you opponent will play / what character he put on which region) and I think it's cool because it doesn't turn into a complete brain-burner. The effects and mechanics work really well and the replay value is double granted with the alternate characters. Great quality components, design, art, box, manual... FFG at it's best.

CONS: The Sauron player has a slight advantage at the first plays because their tactics are slightly easier to run; The big versions of this game kept me from having it for a long time: only after the compact version came out I decided to acquire it.

While it may seem like there are a lot of situations (especially at the beginning) in this Stratego offshoot where it is essentially a crapshoot to who wins, and sometimes that can decide the rest of the game, this is not actually the case. Nice and short, very strategic, great bluffing element (which I am a big fan of), and the endgame is always interesting--I pretty much always want to play this one!

[thing=18833][/thing] was a game I wasn't aware for a long time. I did know it existed, but I didn't mind at all to never get to know it. But, as things went by, I started to read and hear good things about it. However, I already had several good 2 players games ([thing=50][/thing], [thing=71836][/thing] and [thing=760][/thing], for example, and two of them also by Reiner Knizia). Also, it was difficult to track a copy down (specially here in Brazil), so, as many games, I just let it go. Until I didn't.

This game seems to be now my go-to 2 player game when I have another gamer to play it with. It is harder then [thing=50][/thing], and about in the same weight as [thing=760][/thing], though the theme is much more attractive to me than this one. I also enjoy [thing=3][/thing] as a 2-player game, but [thing=18833][/thing] plays faster and is way easier to teach.

The decisions in the game seems always have consequences and I always felt engaged in the gameplay, even when one has the upper-hand (having more characters still in play or something else), because the balance of the game is finely tuned, and the winning conditions made the result unknown until near the end (but, like in [thing=171][/thing], you can see, some moves before the actual end, who will win, when you know which piece is which character, and because the used cards are open information).

At first it seems that the Shadow player has the advantage, since its characters are stronger in its numbers and it has the higher strength card (a six). But the Free People has Boromir, cards like Noble Sacrifice, and Gimli, Merry, Legolas can kill the Orcs, the Witch-King and the Flying Nazgûl directly, without a battle. This all makes for an even game in the end.

A great acquisition for my collection (though it wasn't a cheap one). And I expect many more plays of it in the near future.

The original Confrontation is one of my all-time favorite games. Unfortunately while this edition is pretty, I'm somewhat dissapointed by the design decisions. The vertical character bases knock over too easilly and also make the numbers hard to read. The cards are oversized and awkward. The variant characters and cards are of passing interest. If you can find the original classic edition I recommend it.

I still can't decide if I like this one more than the smaller original edition. We haven't had a problem with the pieces tipping over, as some have had, and the bigger board can make the game feel a little grander. Then again, the original version has portability going for it and I'm not sure the alternate character options in the deluxe edition bring all that much to the game. For now, I'm hanging on to both editions.

Although it's slightly overproduced (and I say this about few games), I will give a hearty thumbs up to Lord of the Rings: Confrontation: the Deluxe Edition.  Games are short and tense; and when you win, it's because you played better!  It retains the feel of the Lord of the Rings universe, while introducing a clever combat system used in many other games such as Game of Thrones.  Some might categorize it as Lord of the Rings Stratego, but that is oversimplifying this elegant game; it's deeper and more interesting than that older, classic game.  Even folks who aren't fans of Tolkein may enjoy this game - one of the best two player games I've ever played.  See my review for more details...

Although I agree that the regular edition is compact and fun, the deluxe edition (including all the components and rules of the regular edition) also includes some really interesting additional rules and pieces. It seems the extra pieces in the "draft version" of the game eliminate some of the expected openings, making for a lot more surprise and variety. One thing I love about this game is that you can win as Frodo even when greatly outnumbered by the Sauron.

At first I wasn't so sure about this, because it never seemed like I could win.  I enjoyed the theme and admired  the combination of the characters and the cards, but it just seemed like a little too much for me.  But eventually I got the hang of it, and beat my husband 3 times in a row, and now I think it's pretty good.  Bluffing isn't my favorite thing, but this is still a great game.  

A nice short game, which really benefits from multiple plays in one sitting.  Sometimes I take it too seriously, though, which is why I don't play quite as much.

First play 7/9/08 - We just used the classic game components. Neither one of us won as the Fellowship. I was able to sneak Frodo as far as one step from Mordor but that was it. I got lucky playing Sauron and shot my Black Riders across the board all the way to one spot in front of The Shire and caught Frodo. He didn't evade (he probably should have) and I took him down. The variant characters and cards look very good and playing with secret drafting would make for a wild game.

This Deluxe Edition of Reiner Knizia’s acclaimed Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation combines a superb craftsmanship with an exciting expansion for this award-winning game. The Confrontation is a two-player board game in which players take control of the forces of Sauron, seeking to find their master’s ring, or the forces of the free peoples of Middle Earth seeking to destroy Sauron's ring in the fires of Mount Doom. One of the most acclaimed board games of recent years, The Confrontation allows players to control many of the famous characters of Tolkien's famous trilogy, while playing an intense 30-minute game that is a wonderful combination of bluffing and strategy. The Confrontation is designed by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia, and considered amongst his best works. WHAT'S NEW: Deluxe Confrontation gives the game a new and larger gameboard, larger sculpted plastic stands, and completely new artwork and graphic design. The game includes 18 entirely new characters in addition to the classic characters found in the original. The new characters allow players to play an entirely new game, or mix the new and the old characters for an entirely different game experience. 4 new Special Cards are also included, for additional special actions.

Knizia's version of Stratego. This wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it is if it didn't have the Lord of the Rings license attached to it. The theme fits the mechanisms almost perfectly, bringing this game to life far more effectively than any game of Stratego ever did for a Napoleonic battle. The asymmetrical win conditions for both sides also make this game a cut above that classic game.

The deluxe version has an extra set of characters for both sides, which is a nice touch. It's out of print now, but I'd be surprised if Fantasy Flight didn't pull out a reprint (or a re-theme) for Peter Jackson's upcoming Hobbit films.

A solid strategy game. Players control 9 characters with special powers. Characters can only move forward and can attack other characters. In addition, you get attack cards that you can use during your attack (similar to Dungeon Twister). Initially, you don't know who the other player's characters are, but you can figure it out after a few skirmishes. It can get very strategic.

Pointlessly oversized box and rules, and some other minor production flaws (I can see some people really freaking, and others not noticing). Disappointed by the cards not being linen-textured, as my old set became tattered quickly.

Gameplay is great, and the new variety a clear improvement (though I confess I haven't played enough to sift through balance issues). Good overall, but when something says deluxe and costs this much, it should be just that, and this falls short for me there.

A great, great two-player strategy game.  Lots of depth and plenty of replay with the alternate characters.  Despite the two sides being wildly different, the game is very balanced.

My only (minor) complaint is with the Eye of Sauron card which is a little too boom-or-bust for my tastes.

This is certainly the version to get if you don't already have it.  A great Stratego style game steeped with Tolkien theme.  I got this version for home games, but the ealier small box version is better for traveling with.  Great art in this set and the larger cards and holders are nicer to handle as well.  The extra characters are nice but you'll also pay more for this version.

Great game of bluff and strategy with a really immersive theme. The rules are very straightforward, but at the same time they force players to make some very difficult choices.

RATING: 10
I like the core design of Stratego. It's a sort of Chess-like game but one where the initial set-up is variable and you don't know which of your opponents figures is which until you attack it or it attacks you.

LotR: Confrontation then, is like the ultimate modern expression of this design. You and your opponent still have a handful of pieces on the board, each with a numeric value representing it's strength. Exactly where each piece begins the game is still up to the players. But each players objective is now different. The Fellowship player only needs to get Frodo to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. The Sauron player needs only to find and defeat Frodo. See the underlying tension, there? It's fantastic.

You still need to make your initial attacks "blindly". You won't really know if that unit in Moria is actually the Balrog until you send someone there to face him. But instead of straight-up determinism (stronger unit beats weaker unit), now when you reveal your troops, each player also chooses a card from their hand and plays it face-down. Some of these cards are simply numbers. Add the number on your card to the value of your character. But some of the cards instead have special text that might totally upset your opponents plans. The bigger number does not always win here.

Also, each character has a unique ability. Frodo, for instance, can retreat sideways if he's attacked...but only if he can legally do so. Gimli automatically wins when fighting the Orcs. Saruman can declare that no cards are played and Boromir sacrifices himself to defeat his opponent.

While the Sauron player has a clear advantage in the numbers game (which is fitting to the theme), with many of his characters having strengths of 5 or higher, the advantage of the Fellowship player is their ability to evade or counter the worst of Sauron's attacks. This is another game of "cat and mouse", with the Fellowship being very much the mouse.

This game is incredibly fast and simple, taking about 5 minutes to explain and about 20 minutes to play. So simple are it's foundations that it masks the dizzying level of "I know that you know" back-and-forth that this game evokes, particularly with repeated plays. With a regular opponent, you'll develop strategies, look for patterns, rewrite those patterns and try desperately to out-fox each other on a board that is cramped and with an army that always feels like it's about to come apart at the seams.

"He put the Balrog in Moria last time, so surely he wouldn't put it there this time. Unless he wants me to think that he wouldn't put it there so that I'll march in to my doom! Unless, of course, he knows that I know that he would do exactly that..."

A brilliant game and one I don't get to play nearly often enough.

There are a couple of variants as standard, with two sets of characters to mix in and different card-based powers so replay value is high. Plays quickly. Always happy to play it.

RATING: N/A
A two-player board game in which players take control of the forces of Sauron, seeking to find their master's ring, or the forces of the free peoples of Middle Earth seeking to destroy Sauron's ring in the fires of Mount Doom. It allows players to control many of the famous characters of Tolkien's famous trilogy, while playing an intense 30-minute game that is a wonderful combination of bluffing and strategy.

Stratego but better. Both sides feel so different but yet I always lose. Better re-read the novels or watch the movies, that always helps.

Don't know why this is a separate listing on the Geek from the original LOTR game. Although I guess it's a mini expansion included in it's own right. I've got the portable edition, and made my own standard and variant units for that edition, but finally broke and brought the deluxe edition. The artwork on the cards are way, way better than the original. The units play a lot better and make sense that the stands are portrait rather than landscape as far as from an illustrative sense. This game just gets better with more plays. I don't know how many I've played, but probably in the region of 50 games with the original game, and 38  games played additonally this year alone using my home-made deluxe set.

RATING: 8.5
Fantastic game. It's like a cross between Stratego and Magic: The Gathering, keeping the best parts of each, and putting it all into a 15 to 30 minute package.

The first few games you explore what can happen, but if you play enough, then with each new game you discover new combinations and strategies. Amazingly well balanced despite dramatically different powers for each side.

(Comments are really for the non-deluxe edition, but since that is hard to find and a subset of the deluxe, here they are again)

Rating after only a few plays.  This game is extremely fun and seems very tactical.  I think more plays will give me a better feel of the strategy.

RATING: 8
Brilliant 2-player game with 'fog of war' through hidden pieces, playable in about 20 minutes.  With a small board and few pieces I expected that some favourite strategies would emerge that would make it formulaic, but having played many games of this now, I find the game still seems infinitely variable, and often generates very tricky adn exciting end-games.  I recommend this one

RATING: 8.1
Great 2 player LoTR themed game.  I prefer the basic mode of play to the variants.  It is quick enough to play multiple games in one session if desired.  Some familiarity with the game is needed to really make the most of the different characters.

RATING: 7
Fun! All sorts of interesting combinations make the expanded game a little less clinical and a little more surprise prone. The price is right as you get two different sets of characters (front and back) and rules to make a 3rd drafting game from them.

Amazing that such a small scale game with so few pieces and so many abstractions can capture the theme and vibe of LotR so well. Filled with tension throughout. The ONLY version of stratego you need to own.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite 'variants' is we randomly shuffle the tiles and you get who you get (between 'classic' and 'variant' characters). BUT they have to go on the board left to right, top to bottom in the order you pick them up. Creates fun chaos!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The gameplay is definitely an improvement on 'Stratego', which it otherwise feels a lot like.  The hand-management aspect adds depth to the battles, with the lower number of units on a side (vs Stratego) definitely reducing the feel of randomness, with the asymmetric goals finally helping to keep both players looking for and doing different things.  Definitely replaces Stratego from the collection, but on the other hand... well, that game never got much play in the first place.

RATING: 7
Good game with lots of possibilities as I learn how to play the game better.  I'm hoping that my brother or Dad enjoy the game and would be willing to play it in the future.  I believe the short playing time, excellent theme, and basically deluxe stratego game play might make that a real possibility.

Seems more chess-like than I originally thought.  I'm normally not much of a chess type of a person.

This is essentially a themed version of Stratego. It is more complex, but the added complexity does not successfully make it more interesting.

Not terrible, merely bad. Will not play again.

After 4 plays, I can say only this: probably it's impossible to play this game with the same person all the time, as I haven't seen many strategies for the Free Peoples Player here. Unless you want to take a risk, of course.

Artwork and components of the deluxe edition are pretty average. Gameplay is engaging with little downtime and lots of indirect player interaction. Bluffing element with play of cards mechanic combine seamlessly. Most surprisingly, the theme does not feel pasted on and is also well-integrated.

Simple rules, quick to play, but an always interesting and deep experience. Knowing your opponent and setting traps for them is about  as fun as knowing yourself and trying to keep away from the traps set for you. In one word, engaging.

[b]I LOVE THIS GAME![/b]

Mind-blowing artwork, simple rules, lots of strategy and thoughtful play, combine to make this a very special game indeed. This is Knizia's masterpiece. No question.

When I first got this, my friend and I played 12 matches in a row on the first day. From that moment I knew that this was probably the best 2-player game that I had ever played.
Each turn is an agonising decision, each play of cards, a battle of minds. The opposing sides are very well balanced, with no broken characters. After every game you are immediately compelled - time permitting - to replay the game with a different setup, or characters, to re-challenge your opponent, just to try out an alternate strategy.

This game has a huge just-one-more-go appeal. Playing time is very fast considering that each and every game is an action-packed experience! A mountain of geeky pleasure can be drawn out of the game solely in the choosing of your army and their subsequent setup - simply deciding which version of the Witch King to include can be an teeth-grinding decision.

You might be fooled into thinking that the game can be solved once you know your friend's basic strategy. Wrong! This is when the game is just starting to come to the boil - just when you seem to have everything falling wonderfully into place, your plans become dust, as your opponent throws you a curveball you never saw coming. This game as deep as a dwarf mine.

One memorable game will last with me for years: my old dad executed the perfect bluff, masterfully sneaking Frodo around my forces of evil, just like in the books. LOTR The Confrontation is full of these moments.
My best mate and I continually struggle to destroy/save Gandalf, and also wrestle for control of Fangorn forest - to stop/enable the wizard's resurrection. Each battle centres on Gandalf; just as it should be.

The LOTR theme certainly helps push up the rating, as I'm quite the Tolkien nerd. Most importantly, this game is a vast amount of fun, and plays swiftly; perhaps the greatest two attributes a boardgame can have these days.
In summary: Confrontation is a must for any LOTR fan and gamer. This is a quality product with amazing replayability. If you like the LOTR theme you will NOT be disappointed with your purchase. A perfect 10 game.

I am avid board/card game player; I have 50 or so games and have been a big fan of boardgamegeek.com for years but I have never ranked any games until now; this is best 2 player game I have ever played; everyone I introduce to the game is crazy for it;  I took it to family camp last summer and all of the kids ages 9 to 16 where waiting in 4-5 person-long lines to get a chance to play.  Reiner Knizia is my idol.

The classic game is, of course, identical to [gameid=3201], other than having bigger components.  Having played only that mode so far, it is still good, quick, intense fun for two players.

The variants provided by the alternate characters seem like they should enable the game to stay fresher even with more frequent plays.

Simple but enjoyable. Very nice art. The addition of the variants doubles the value - without them, the game would become uninteresting all too soon. Good for situations when you have just an hour or two to kill - and just two players.

I love this game, and more variation makes this one live longer. Only thing that bugs me is, why they had to make this one bigger? I liked that smaller basic version, it was easier to take with you and... I don't know, small is beatifull.

After 2+ Plays: I like the asymmetrical goals and powers of the original game more than the variant powers, which seemed to eliminate the distinction in play styles between the two sides.  I have not tried the drafting variant, but it seems like too much prep work for a pretty short game.

Gloriously overproduced! This 2-player game squeezes about as much theme as it can from its very mechanical design. The cards help a great deal, and the game does lose some clarity in an attempt to be thematic, but it all comes together to deliver a right-to-the-action, bluffing experience that's worth it.

4/24/09 -- Sans expansion, the original was a much better package (cheaper, smaller and nicer components).  Haven't tried the expansion part yet, so I don't know how well it makes up for its own shortcomings.

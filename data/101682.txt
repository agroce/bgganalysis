I bought this to find out more about the Thirty Years' War, and figured if I just started at the counters and scenarios (and detailed Playbook with loads of historical info) it would be worth it, bonus if I actually played a scenario.

Now I have tried two scenarios... It is a fairly complicated system, tries to get around the IGO UGO dynamic by dividing each army into multiple wings and having alternate wing activations, and having many opportunities for reaction movement and fire.  This all sounds good in theory, although in practice I am still working out how to attack in this situation. The attacker can invoke all sorts of reaction fire, which is in some ways unlimited (although only one-hex range, thankfully, from infantry and cavalry). Movement is also complicated (although realistically, I would imagine) by "formation hits" caused by moving uphill or through most any kind of terrain except clear.  Trying out the White Mountain scenario, I turned my Imperial/Liga forces into mush by taking them uphill and through occasional forests and such.  One has to alternate movement activations and reforming activations--White Mountain isn't for beginners (Fleurus is the most straightforward scenario).

I think this all does lead to solitaire playability, however, as it is hard to develop any detailed plans in advance--and certainly nothing is hidden.

Rating based on the series. I am more interested now in the what each game offers as far as scenarios, so will comment upon them.

White Mountain - One playing.
Cramped feeling and not much room for maneuver due to terrain and proximity of forces. Superbly led Catholics with a good army are more than a match for the poorly led Protestants. The trick is determining how to get up the mountain to engage them in a timely fashion. Should they do so, it is not much of a fight. Too much may hinge on the Transylvanians who leave or enter the fray on a die roll. Not my favourite battle, but more interesting than I first assumed.

I've played White Mountain, Wimpfen and Fleurus. The Musket and Pike system of wings and prescriptive orders produces a beautiful chaos, a sensation of desperately trying to maintain order as everthing is falling apart.

The terrain in SiA is properly unforgiving and I enjoyed Fleurus most out of those I played - by coincidence that is probably the most open and flattest battlefield in the set.

The combat rules are something of a mess, I think. But the system shows you a wonderful thing - command and control failing to keep up with the situation, and the mayhem which results.

I think this just isn't my cup of tea, but I'm not sure I want to spend several hours where my primary focus is on how to move my units while preventing their formation integrity from disintegrating.  That's an astonishing amount of tedium.

Maybe this is a problem with the scenarios in this module compared to others in the series...  I'm not sure if I care to find out.

I will say that the component quality is very good.  I like the counters.

Love the Musket and Pike rules. Very elegant system which oozes historical accuracy and encourages the use of contemporary tactics. Excellent Playbook that acts as a springboard for getting into the history of the TYW (a period I knew nothing about). Cavalry is a glass hammer and needs to be managed carefully in order to maximise it's effectiveness over time. Components look fantastic arrayed on the board. Would love to have more time to get into the system... Damn you real world!

Fantastic system. VERY innovative combat control system. One of the few tactical systems that plays like tactical system should:

1) Chaos; you sort of have control of your troops

2) Story: system produces a great storyline

3) Decision making: Generates decisions at the command level - you feel like you are giving orders and hoping they are carried out. Great trade-offs in the decision making - what risk/reward level do you accept and what point in the battle.

4) Drama: dramatic swings in the battle

Can't say enough good about the system (and I'm not a tactical fan...and the period is not one of my favorites). Game is on v6.0 now of Musket & Pike rules - it's done with its shakedown cruise. Hats off to the designer and developer. Outstanding.

Downside, as with anything that is meaty, the learning curve. Get someone to show the game or watch one of the many youtube videos: problem solved.

Incredible scenario design in this package.  Quality-wise, the Catholics are pretty much unstoppable against the incompetent early protestant armies, but that means you HAVE to replicate their historical victories to get the win if you play as them.

RATING: 8
his game shares the same excellant system as the other Musket and Pike games. Ideal mix of tactical detail, command and control and simplicity I have seen. The simple command chit system forces you to plan ahead.  The game rewards the proper use of reserves. Timing is also an important skill in this game. A line of fresh troops charging into the enemy's tired and worn out formations will often  bring victory to your side.  . 

This game has a nice set of smaller battles. Have played White Mountain and  Höchst.  As expected from the history. Both are challanges for the Protestants to win, but we enjoyed the games.

Saints in Armor is part of GMT's Musket and Pike series, which bears a family resemblance to their Great Battles of History series despite being by different designers.  As befits the era, command and control are midway between that of GBOH and rules typical of American Civil War games.  The most startling feature of the game is how quickly formations break down in any sort of terrain.  It's no worse than for Alexander's phalanxes (GBOH), but at least Alexander had the sense to fight his pitched battles in open country.  I tried the White Mountain scenario of SiA and found myself attacking out of a town, through a woods, around a cliff and up a hill so steep that units needed to stop and reform twice to make it up.  That process ate up all but the last turn of the game for 2/3 of the attacking army.  This has got to be the most frustrating scenario I've played in any game.  Even leading torpedo bombers at Midway doesn't measure up.  On the right flank, where I could engage, the battle evolved much as it would in GBOH, but with fire power and unit interactions during close combat appropriate to the 17th century.  The combat rules seemed well thought out there and not too hard too remember given all the table support.  Overall, the rules are clear and logical, but fairly complex.

Pieces, maps, and player aids were fine in terms of material and artwork.  GMT knows how to make a map that lays flat.  I've played enough vintage games on odd paper lately, that I'm coming to appreciate their expertise in "materials science" even more.

I think I'd rate this game at leave one level higher if I'd played one of the five other scenarios instead of White Mountain.

Beautiful production, a diverse assortment of scenarios, and superb supporting materials. 

White Mountain is both the shortest battle in the box and the most famous. Wimpfen is a slugfest. Höchstis is a balancing act. Fleurus is a knifefight. Stadtlohn is a car chase (all but literally). Lutter is smashmouth Musket and Pike. Noting more to ask for with this one.

Interesting concepts with Wings that are restricted by orders and reactive fire and movements, but plays out to fiddly and long.
Some rules are counterintuitive (i assume combination of all rules still yields historical results) and active play seems to be punished. Maybe that there is a learning curve and the historical reality was cautious maneuvering, but for me the fun factor was to low to invest more time.

Great, great, great game system. Rules are a bit hard to grasp but once you have figured it out you get a pre-modern battle experience that beats any other game I know. No GBOH game has ever given me a similar feeling of commanding an army on the battlefield. Sometimes a bit fiddly.

RATING: 9
This is a well crafted and ambitious game because it offers dynamic and intricate mechanisms with lots of interactions between the two players and a nice command and control model. In a lot of ways it is the logical evolution of GBoH, less quirky but also more advanced with the orders system which adds impetus and inertia to the battles. This is not a game for beginners, the rules are clear but oh boy is their application not easy to handle at first. But this is what gives the game so much depth and historical flavour. One of my favourite game in the serie because it covers the initial period of the 30 years war and the battles themselves are easier to manage with their relatively modest size. Moreover the scenarios are varied with lots of interesting and tactically challenging situations.

plus : historical setting, varied and original scenarios
minus : even though the victory conditions of the battles are balanced, the majority is imo better suited for solo play because they are often either lopsided or have one side which is very passive.

Second game in the M&P series that I have played. The system is very elegant and intuitive. And the rules are very tight because of the updates/revisions of each volume to refine/clarify the games. I started with NGBG, so I'm not sure how problematic implenting the changes have been for players that started at the beginning, but starting with the latest revisions makes the games simple to play. 

For the most part, the SiA scenarios are relatively small in scale. The games play relatively quickly. Once you have a few battles under your belt the rules lookup are few and far between.

Another great addition to the Musket & Pike series. The game has come a long way and the rules refined along the way. I must admit I may be a little biased as this is one of my favorite periods, but you won't be disappointed with this system. Not all the scenarios are balanced but then they really weren't back then, what is really cool are the different situations that each game provides and Saints in Armor is no different. Artwork is great on the counters and maps, and the battles a little smaller, so in the end you get quicker play.

Has quickly become my favourite entry in the M&P series, mainly because of the period covered, the interesting variety of battles covered, and the outstanding historical research. 

The full-colour player aids for each battle are a nice touch too. The production values show GMT at its finest.

Tentative rating.  I played a turn to get familiar with the mechanics.  Then I started over and lost on turn 2.  I wasn't sure how to get to the required 8 VPs, but I didn't realize you were scoring 1 VP for the blue area every turn.  
I'm looking forward to getting this one on the table more in the new year.  
The cup system was pretty neat.  The combat system was, shall we say, different, but it certainly wasn't boring.
There is a lot more to this game than your typical small package solitaire game.  Having free leader actions and actions for the different legions that all have pluses and minuses while hitting turn-by-turn required goals and a long term goal give it a lot of punch.

Update: Played it again.  I guess I just don't get this game.  That's not a mark on the game.  I just can't seem to connect with it.

Decent game with a clever design. The difficulty of a particular session can swing based on hostile reactions and rolls during battle. Though, if battle rolls go badly, you are more likely to shift strategy more dramatically. While there are incentives that are tied to the theme (e.g., the benefits of gaining Roman presence in the various regions throughout Britain), Agricola plays a bit more abstractly than I would prefer -- it feels more like a puzzle as opposed to a campaign to pacify Britain. The end-game fight as a large series of dice rolls is kind of poor, but I guess it adds another layer of preparation to the gameplay. I prefer the sessions where Calgacus stays in the cup. Still, it is an OK alternative when I want a short-to-medium length game that provides some war game aspects.

Edit, Feb. 2018: Lacks replay value once you figure out the strategy of the game.

What a neat little solitaire game. Lots of little nuances and twists make this much more than what would otherwise feel like whack-a-mole. Most significantly is the cup system for "tracking" hostility towards Agricola and the Roman legionaries. The stakes are high, and the end of turn VP targets mean that they stay high from the beginning onwards. It is also playable in a very reasonable period of time.

Tensed solitare war game. I loved cup mechanism. The climax war of the game against red tribe leader is somewhat difficult and exciting but includes a lot dice rolling. Area control, action point allowance, it reminds me pandemic in some way but obviously has better mechanics. However it may not be for dice-haters.

I like the game in all aspect and waiting for my Charlamagne pnp. It is one of the best solitare game i own and a delicious example of long, strategic solo war game. It is not that abstract and i find theme is pretty strong.

Agricola, Master of Britain achieves a lot with relatively few components and a set of rules that are not very complex. The boards and counters are good quality and the rulebook is clear and fairly comprehensive. You have a challenge to reach the end of the game with sufficient VPs, and there are enough types of actions to always provide you with a choice of what to do at any given point. What sets Agricola apart from, for example, the States of Siege series of solitaire historical games, is the unpredictability provided by the draw from the hostile tribe cup. The use of the three cups for the tribes is an interesting "under the hood" component of the game engine. You never quite know what is in the cups (type and number of chits), but you are aware that you need to balance your actions to ensure there are always some tribes available in the friendly cup. It also means that actions that move tribes to the friendly cup or place them directly there (peacekeeping, negotiation, units moving from the deadpool if their region has a 3+ settlement and no tribes) are needed to balance out the more aggressive actions.

I've only managed six games so far but I'm really liking it, even though I've so far had my butt handed to me. Looking forward to getting better at the game. Expecting that my rating may go up. Seems like there's a lot of depth to this little game.

RATING: N/A
It's a very good solitaire game -easy to learn, fast to play- that pushed down a lot of "State of Siege" plays (for me at least), mainly because there is more decision making and less luck factor. The "mechanic of the cups" really surprised me, and puts another layer of strategy in the game. 

In my book it's one of the best solitaire games I've played in medium to low complexity category.

[b]7: Good game. Usually willing to play. I might even request or recommend it.[/b]

This is a good game, a lot going on for such a small footprint, don't be deceived by the games size. The current weight of 3/5 is fairly spot on. 

One has to wonder though, if this isn't because of the rule book? I just can't help but feel that it could have been laid out better, or perhaps someone needs to make a flowchart for the game. It's a little difficult to get into but rewarding once you do. Would be an 8 if it weren't for the rule book layout.

It took me a couple of plays to really understand the system, but I think this is one of the best solitaire war-games I have played. Much better than the State of Siege games that I have tried. (Admittedly I have not played Cruel Necessity, probably the best of that genre.) Not nearly as complex and long as Navajo Wars, but a Pandemic like puzzle in terms of complexity and length, with a historical theme.

Wow, so far, so good.  Two plays, and have lost in turn 2 and turn 3.  You have to move much more quickly than I have.  Not sure I have all the rules right, because three actions to gain enough points in turn 1 seems daunting.  But otherwise the game flows nicely, and although I need to develop a viable strategy, the differing attitudes of the tribes is really innovative and keeps it exciting.  Have a feeling it may be some time before I win the thing.

[b]Agricola, Master of Britain[/b]
1 player

[i]It is the year of Vespasian and Titus - the sixth such ordinary consulship that Titus shared with his Imperial father. The civil war of a decade ago is but a memory, and the Flavians have restored peace and order to all corners of the empire, save one. The people of Brittania remain fiercely resistant to the will of their Roman masters, and the emperor has charged YOU with the seemingly impossible task of bringing them to heel.

Agricola, Master of Britain is a solitaire game of governance and conquest. To master the delicate political situation, you will need the right blend of military force, administration, bribery, and diplomacy. Every action you take matters, changing how the native populace feels about you and your rule. But you'll never know exactly who's with you or against you, because the game tracks this "under the hood", or, more precisely, "in the cup".

Three chit-pull cups (Friendly, Unfriendly, and Hostile) represent the allegiances of the units contained within those cups. After each action you take, one or more of these units are blindly moved from one cup to another. You'll have a general idea of "I'm really cheesing them off" or "I should have a lot of friendlies available for recruitment", but until you pull a chit, you won't know who your friends really are, or where the next rebellion will spring up. This isn't totally random: certain tribes naturally skew more in one direction or the other, and taking actions to stabilize a region after it's been pacified will diminish the chances of revolt there.

Building the right armies, and taking the right actions at the right time is key to your success. But the Flavians - and particularly the hated Domitian - expect greater and greater results with each campaign season. You'll need to meet and exceed them if you want to duplicate Agricola's achievement.[/i]

A neat game, and not too heavy once you internalize the rules.  It certainly has a nice strategic arc, where you start out overwhelmed, begin to develop tenuous progress, and end up settling and dominating the region.

I'm not sure it has a lot of replay value, but it was neat figuring out the right strategy.  It's tense and well balanced, although the end game can feel a bit rote -- I was passing a lot at the end to earn VP.  Bad luck can make you insta-lose, but for the most part you are responsible for your own failures.

The way enemy chits move between cups is neat.  It means that you start off with a lot of knowledge about which tribes hate vs. tolerate vs. like you, but as time progresses you get more and more uncertain.  It would have been neat if there has been possible to learn more information about the cup contents later in the game, as by then everything was mixed together.  But for most of the game it was a nice mechanic for creating imperfect understanding of alliances.

An impressive design. Elegant interacting mechanisms simulate a remarkable range of elements of the campaign, and you're given a lot of freedom in determining what actions you want your legions to accomplish. The rulebook is tight, the map graphics are spot on, replayability is high and the footprint is small - what more could you want?

Print and play version, counter and maps graphics are decent.  Rules are clear and not too challenging The game itself is a challenging solo game and it's beaten me easily in the 2 plays so far. Interest still holds and I'm determined to play better next time
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Small footprint, but more depth than one imagined (this is not a simplistic game!). There are several immediate loss criteria, so as the Romans there's potential to be on the edge of you seat on various turns.

The cup transfer mechanic is brilliant, literally mixing things up and keeping the player guessing. Also, VP's accumulate every turn which I do like, though I'm not quite sure about the endgame. 

Very worthy of purchase, play, and study - I also have Charlemagne which expands upon this game. I'm not going to rate this yet as I believe several more plays are required.

A clever game, as it seems many of the games released by Hollandspiele are. For a game consisting of 2 game boards, 1 sheet of counters, and a small rulebook, it evokes a strong feeling of Agricola (potentially) pacifying Britain. Plenty of strategy, a plethora of options available each turn, and battles still feel tactical, even if simplified a bit.

It makes you want to set it up again immediately after failing to try another strategy, to fix that 1 thing you could've done better. Okay, okay...many things you could've done better!

The counters and map/game boards are lovely. Great presentation all around!

Off of first play: It's like Charlemagne, only it plays must faster (good!) and with mounted boards (excellent!); but it's also got less going on (not good) and is a lot swingier (bad).  Losing to the big boss fight at the end (Calgacus) due to poor rolling (and the fact the units are tougher, and go first) is annoying, fortunately mitigated somewhat by the relative brevity of the game.  I like it, but I'd rather play Charlemagne: Master of Europe if I had the time.

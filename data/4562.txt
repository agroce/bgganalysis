RATING: 4
Interesting econ game, especially since it's relatively short. I've noticed in my plays that it exhibits the Puerto Rico Effect since it's a fixed turn order for early sections of each card/round and that impacts how you pick whether to pass/attack/etc. In two games in particular I can remember sitting next to someone who wanted to play super conservatively, so I had to adjust my play style to match, otherwise they would be able to drop out with a larger chip pay out. Not a bad thing, just something to be aware of. I'm fine with playing (especially with 4 or more), but won't pick up a copy.

Very cool winding and unwinding that goes on here. In the first half of the game there is a race to buy and then just like that, we turn on a coin and get into a race to sell. Very unique and fun.

An auction game with a couple of clever twists.  Players bid with chips and scoop the pot if they pass, so there is often a strong incentive to drop out.  The winner of the auction has the choice of selling a share or taking the one on offer.  Second place can perform whichever action the winner didn't.  Timing is critical in selling because the price you get (in victory points) is dependent on the number of the type of share currently held by players.  As so often with Schacht, simple rules, but a lot of punch in a small package.

This game has a lot going for it. Nice, simple gameplay that cleverly models the rise and fall of stock values. It plays three quite well, though rather differently than with six. In my experience, it takes one go-round before players fully "get it", but once they've played, it's nice to have this game around.

Tentative rating after 2 plays.  A fun bidding game with an auction similar to Traumfabrik.  How much do you want that stock, and how much are you willing to make someone else sweat.  This will be reprinted by Rio Grande. (Purchased 03/28/08)

RATING: 5
A cleaver and simple auction/stock game that plays quickly and provides a decent amount of brain-burn. Not only are you trying to value cards for yourself, you're trying to deduce how your opponents value the cards to decide whether to bid or pass. But you're not only bidding to win, you're often bidding for second-place (Each card has 2 actions... 2nd place may do unchosen action), bidding to protect your stock value, or bidding to stay in the pot so you can pass when the pot's value is much larger. 

There is a palpitate amount of luck and the selling action is rarely that important in the beginning of the game (thus, being 2nd place isn't a huge deal). But overall, I find this game quite intriguing and fun to play. 

[Update] After playing the 2015 version, I got to say it improves on this version. The additional place-depot action makes the sell action important throughout the entire game.

Excellent pseudo-filler stock and bidding game!

In Mogul a card is turned up and those who have matching cards earn a victory point. Plastic chips are then used to conduct a curious form of auction in which players take turns either contributing a chip to the pot to stay in or take everything there and drop out. The eventual winner either takes the card or wins the right to sell one he already has, the second place finisher being able to do the other. Selling value is equal to the number of shares of that type currently being held by all players. The system is easily understood, plays clever and is tricky to navigate. There can also be quite a bit of angst deciding whether to put in a chip hoping to get more later or get into a mano a mano competition; wondering when the opponent will be forced to fold. Although it's almost all auction, it proceeds so quickly that one doesn't mind. As it accepts the relatively rare six players as well, this small package should find appeal to just about everyone.

Too much luck in the card drawing. You can mitigate a bit through statisctics, but meh. The bidding is mean and a bidding war can really set you back. It's minimalism, but not the fun kind. Awesome plastic coins though. Stacking them in firm piles was the part I enjoyed most.

A quick stock exchange game, not dissimilar to Union Pacific in the push your luck element, with the added bidding ala Taj Mahal.  Which is great, since I like the both mentioned games exactly for those two of their attributes.  The only problem here is that you are never quite in control, since the right card has to show up for you to be able to sell the shares.  Which can be quite annoying, but for such a short game this is not a major issue.  The scoring board is very ugly, though - I believe it has taken special care to achieve that level of ugliness.

The bidding is unique, but just freaks me out.  Too many times, your choice is dictated by the person to your right, leaving you feeling not in control at all.  And the starting setup of all brown makes everybody want the same thing at the start, which isn't good for a game about how-much-is-it-worth-to-whom.

Played this once and look forward to playing again.  Pretty simple game...almost qualifies as filler.  The auction mechanic is well done...similar to Hollywood Blockbuster.  All the money is self contained and redistributed to those who bow out.  7 is probably as high as I would rate it.  But I don't think it would drop below 6.

RATING: 5
Clever little auction game.  Each turn a stock card is flipped up and auctioned.  You toss in 1 chip to remain, or can drop out and claim the current pot.  The winner can either take the stock card, or sell the other stock represented on the card, while second place takes the option the winner didn't choose.  Stock is valued at the number currently on the table.  Victory points are judged from sale of stock.  Very clever little game.

i'm slightly disappointed. Interesting bidding/auction system however i'm not sure there is enough play variety to justify a long play time for a simple game. The rating could go up if the play time comes down. (play time has come down, but we play with open $$ which has helped and now put the game at a 6 vs  the old 5)

There's a lot to like in this little stock/bidding game.  It may take a little while to get used to how the colors on the cards are used - background color versus border color - but once you get it, you can really begin to appreciate the elegance of the design.  The auction mechanism is clever and the game has several interesting decision points that force you to choose between making an immediate small profit or taking a chance and waiting for a potentially bigger payoff at greater risk - which is pretty much how playing stocks works.

Absolutely brilliant little auction and risk management game. I played it with 3 and it shines in that configuration where you have a lot of control.

Mogul is a clever little auction game (using the same type of auction as Lascaux, or rather the other way around since Mogul was first). However, where Lascaux combines it with bluffing, a bit of push-your-luck, and a heavy dose of plain old luck, Mogul requires much more precise control. There are comparatively few rounds in which the item up for auction is of interest but you need the other rounds to prepare and make these few count.

For a game that requires this amount of control and precise timing, the effects of seating order seem quite high here.

I like the idea of a game that is one part auction and one part Geschenkt, and I like the idea of having to drop out to receive money.  I think it is probably best with less players.  My rating could improve with repeated plays.  One thing I did notice is that we played it wrong, so this is definitely worth another shot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tight little minimalist bidding game with a "chicken" element a la Taj Mahal or poker - players have to decide when to cut their losses, and when to go for broke.  It's a game all about timing, both in the bidding itself, and in the purchase and sale of the railroad stocks.  The auction mechanism used here is very novel, but not always equitable, since the seating order has a large effect on the bidding.  Reminds me of High Society in that the ordering of cards at the end of the deck will often determine who wins and who falls just short.  The best you can do, sometimes, is just to put yourself in position to be one of the two or three players that can win, depending on how the cards fall.  Plays quickly and very easy to learn.

Something in flavour of 'Don' by the same designer (Michael Schacht).  Bidding system reminds 'Geschenkt' ('No thanks!') but is more complex.

Interesting mechanics which requires you to sell your shares (and earn VPs) not too soon and not too late.  Smart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating HIGHLY depends on player number. If playing with 3 maybe an 8, 4 is a 6 or 7, and any other number is [b]4[/b]. The reason is very simple, 5 and 6 the game is WAY too long with too little control, and 2 just not competitive enough (maybe 5 or 6 player game could be tweaked? Even with 3 it can be a tad too long for what it is). 

A little like Modern Art how you hold things you hope are valuable later, but not as good, I would rather play that one with 4 or 5 since with those numbers they are roughly same length. Nice pissing wars here mixed with push your luck, a little reminiscent of one of my favs, Taj Mahal.  Theme totally pasted as usual for the author. There are nice trade-offs of wanting cards and needing money, hand management and timing are critical. 

Luck comments saying its way too high seem a little unfounded, its there, but no one forces you to sell, and you KNOW which cards are in the deck from the start of game so you only need to track them a little bit to know what is coming up, the when isn't too critical until near the end since you can sell almost any time, and near the end if you still have cards it means you are REALLY pushing your luck. However, a card you needed to sell might come up after you just spent some money, and now this blows your chance since you can’t compete, you have to manage your money and timing here. 

The biggest luck is really where the game ending card comes up in the last 4, and if it keeps a couple other cards buried or not, which someone might be (mostly foolishly pushing their luck!) waiting for. Game is still a little too light imho, even though it was trying to build on no thanks it really needed one more element to do it right. Card counting would REALLY help in this one.  Probably Schacht’s best game (don’t like most of his, this one seems better than others for sure)

(Note to self - game is similar to Don, need to try that one)

A constricted and inflexible stock game where it is easy to get financially hamstrung. The best move might be to make one big sale rather than lots of little ones. There is no market per-se.

It's just okay.

Mogul is a low-profile release from Michael Schacht that was combined into a series with two other games. It is the only one that was able to build up a base of fans big enough to warrant a reprint which is scheduled for this quarter. 
As it is judged favourably by gamers that enjoy the reduced style of Winsome train games etc. I had some hopes but I was disappointed. At its core, it's the auction mechanism that was reused later in Lascaux and No Thanks! To stay in the share auction, players pay one coin. Otherwise, they take the money from the pot and drop out. The last bidder can decide whether he buys the current share or sells shares of the colour allowed for sale. The penultimate bidder gets to use the other privilege. I already didn't like this mechanism in Lascaux and I don't like it here. Too much hoping to have enough money with other interested players concurrently being low on funds when the right share card comes along. The strategy is clear, its realization depends heavily on tactical optimization, left-right binding and luck with no interplay variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The main problem with this game is the speed.  Though it is very light and in theory a short game, it feels a lot longer because of the nature of the bidding.  The auction is similar to Geschenkt, but the problem is that only one bidder is eliminated at a time, making the process very long with the full complement of players.  I'd like to try this with three to see how it works.  With six players, it takes too long to auction a card, and winning an auction puts you out of contention for a while, making it feel like you're not really accomplishing much.  It seems like you would be much more active when playing with 3.

Traded away.

A very interesting, light stock game where a player bids on a stock and choose to acquire the stock or sell the color that is available to be sold that round.  Stock values go up as more players hold shares and fall precipitously as sold.  As the bids are being placed you can choose to take the bids of other players rather than continuing to bid.

A clever filler game with a great bidding mechanic.  The modern version fixes some issues with the first edition of the game where you have a map to take actions rather than just losing your turn if you cannot sell anything in that color stock.

This game is stripped down to the basest of levels.  The bidding is good fun, lots of tension.  When to set up for a run, when to grab yhe cash and go.  When to sell and how long to risk the end of the game.  But still, it is doing the same thing over and over, and if you screw yourself early, like Bartel, you are pretty much done.  Would play if asked but not one I would want to request, as there is just not enough to it.

A tough auction game that uses a mechanic similar to that in Geschenkt.  It's also a stock marktet game so the timing of the buy/sell decisions are important.  Unfortunately bad or wildly unpredictable play by other players can really throw you off your game.  UPDATE: Raised rating up a point.  I like the decision-making of how long to stay in bids and how long to keep/sell stocks.  Let's just say it's growing on me.

Kind of neat game by Michael Scacht. Each round, a railroad stock drawn from a deck is put up for bid. Players put in a bid chip to stay in the bidding or take all other put up bids to withdraw from the bidding for the round. Winner gets the choice of keeping the stock, or selling different shares at a value equal to the visible stock of that color on the table. The person who finished second in the bidding gets the other choice. Game ends when you draw the "crash" card, randomly inserted in one of the last four cards of the deck. It has some neat mechanics but people's fortunes seem to hinge on the location of the crash card. I realize it is there to discourage card counting and add uncertainty, but it appears to add to much randomness to the game in determining the winner. If it comes early, it rewards the person who sells quickly, but if it comes late, it rewards the person selling as late as possible.

Very unique (almost)zero-sum bidding game. I like it better than Geschenkt(aka No Thanks). Simple and exciting. Card distribution chart is essential in my opinion (otherwise it will be too random)

Another auction game with a feel similar to Modern Art. You're never sure what you can sell or if you will have the money to bid on the ability when it comes up. Too much luck in what cards come up, and player order can affect your holdings too easily.

Love the components of this game - the small box has great artwork and the colourful cards are attractive. The central auction mechanism in truth has little to do with the reality of the stock market, but the gameplay is so engaging it doesn't matter. One thing I especially like is the dynamic of having to invest heavily in the various railway companies, before selling off all the stock prior to the big crash (market crash that is, not train crash).

A Michael Schacht game (China, Coloretto, Industria, Magna Grecia).
This is a very clever auction/bidding game. On each turn you try to win a share of a railroad company stock or sell your previously accumulated shares. The setting is the roaring 1920's, just before the stock market crash of 1929. The neat bidding mechanic, the limited options of the auction winner, along with the extremely tight money make for some tough decision making and a tense game. Furthermore, the game flows quickly and takes less than an hour to play.

Good, fast auction game that is simple to teach.  Money passes easily but points are hard to earn.  Plays as quickly as a hand of cards. This is a beer and pretzels type game as there is a great deal of luck concerning the stocks available for sale. A lot of fun.

This might actually have been an excellent game if there was just a little more substance.  There isn't enough length and there's too much randomness for the strategy elements to really play themselves out.  You just have to hope you get the cards you need when you have the money and position to use them.  Probably appeals to people in the same way No Thanks! does.  Unfortunately, I don't like No Thanks!, either.

--May2012-- Cool tiny auction game:  one needs to win the occasional auction in order to have shares to sell, and one needs to bail on auctions periodically in order to have the funds to win when necessary.  Each auction permits one player to sell a particular company's shares - while providing a different share to another player.  The buy/sell decision is cool, too.  The question, though, is how much randomness is imposed by the card distribution:  it's not yet clear.  My first play was fun, though.

As the precursor to [thing=12942][/thing], Mogul puts its unique bidding system to good use by offering incentives to be the last two standing in the auction. The decision to keep the stock or sell is appropriately layered, as players have to consider the remaining shares and sales available, as well as whether the second place winner wants a particular option badly.

But everything else about the game isn't very fun. While large point gains are possible (and often decide the winner), most point gains throughout are incremental. Furthermore, the auctions are numerous and repetitive, and you will just watch the card pass back and forth if you have no incentive to participate. There is no doubt that the game is mechanically interesting, but it is also terribly dry.

I guess I have a weakness for M. Schacht's games.  The simplicity and elegance may cause some drawbacks  (it's a little dry, a little repetitive, and a bad player can play havoc on your stategies), but the upside is way up:  it's a fast, easy-to-learn, tension-filled game, with a tight auction mechanism that can get a bit nasty (in a good way).

This is a beautifully stripped down stock game.  Very simple, but quite compelling.  The mechanics are kind of the flipside of Geschenkt's, and in my mind just as compelling.  There is certainly a slight dependence on luck and the caprice of others, but while it normally drives me crazy in other games, here it works as the game is all about speculation.  It think this is a wonderfully designed system, and feel it is one of Schacht's best designs.  Rating may go up with more plays.

A really quick, enjoyable game of buying low and selling high, plus a poker-like element of knowing when to stay in and when to fold (although you can make money folding).  I&#039;m usually good at these types of games, but for some reason I finish at or near the bottom every time!

Features the 'pay a token to stay in' bidding seen a couple of years later in [gameid=12942], but here it's part of a stocks & shares game of auctioning either a stock or the right to sell a type of stock for VP. Winner chooses action, second place takes remaining action. Stock in hand at game end is worthless, so it's good to have bidding tokens when there's an opportunity to sell your stocks.

I thought this was suppose to be a filler, but it ran a little long with a group of 5. Some players had trouble grasping what was going on and others spent excessive time debating their play. Hopefully it'll go quicker next time.

Second game with 3 went quicker and all players lapped the board. Much higher scoring the second time. I think this is probably a 3-4 kind of game.

DIY version. This is up there with Paris Connection as the simplest stock games I've played that seem like they work.

Basically, you can only buy and sell shares of a certain type based on which card is drawn each turn, and you have to win at an auction to take these actions. Near the end of the deck a "crash" card is shuffled; when this is revealed the game ends and shares in hand are worth nothing.

The sale value of a share is equal to the number of that type of share held by all the players. Shares also pay small dividends occasionally. So it is good to hold shares for their dividends, but when the sale value is high, you want to sell before anyone else, because selling reduces the value.

The bidding in the auctions uses an almost completely separate currency from what you earn off shares. (Shares basically just earn you VP.) The bidding mechanic serves to keep the bidding currency in the system: When it's your turn to bid, you either add a token to the pool or drop out of the auction and take the pool. The last person to drop out (the first loser) gets the option of taking the option that the winner doesn't choose (either taking the share or selling off a different, specific type).

This mechanic is definitely elegant, and also prevents a run-away leader issue as you can't turn past success into any lasting bidding advantage. But it does mean the value of a bidding token is situational. You may e.g. on some turn be considering not so much what's up for auction, but how you can get more tokens to be in a better position for a later turn. And if you spend everything, you can unexpectedly be in a terrible position in the next round if there's something you really need.

Also, at least with 4+ players, the bidding mechanic seems arbitrary in how it doles out tokens to the losers. It depends a lot on where you're seated in player order.

As a 20 to 30 minute filler, I think Mogul is my absolute favorite. Outside of the initial (minor) challenge of wrapping your head around the difference between "background color" and "stock color" the game is super quick and easy to grasp. And once everyone at the table gets it, the action, tension and screwage are mixed to perfection. It would be unfair to compare this zippy game with longer, meatier fare-- and were one to do so, it probably would barely merit a 5 or 6. For if it were an hour or more the lack of control and player seat order issues would be annoying. But in my game world, filler can be excused from the exacting requirements of longer games, especially when it delivers a lot of that "long game" punch in the form of difficult decisions, a sense of playing arc and (most importantly!) a whole lot of fun. The mechanic of "chip tossing as bidding until somebody snatches the pot" is familiar to anyone who has played "No Thanks." But in Mogul, it is mashed up with a stock game instead of a rummy meld. That shift, from Meld to Stock, elevates the mechanic from mildly amusing to richly entertaining.

First of all, the components are top notch, from nice box artwork that's 1 of 3 in a series that line up next to one another, to excellent plastic chips and other nice bits that are impressive considering the game retails for $20.  If you've played Geschenkt, Mogul will feel very familiar.  Instead of tossing in chips to avoid taking a card, you pay to stay in an auction.  I think this mechanic is beautiful and am happy to see it show up in a different game.  Works as a quick filler game, but has a lot of good, tough decisions.  Definitely one of my favorites.

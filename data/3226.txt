College football minus the cheerleaders, booze, and school fight songs. It's still a great game.\

I own the original Sports Illustrated edition (small brown box) and the later Avalon Hill edition (gray bookcase box).

The best simulation of college football I have every played!  I'm sorry that my beloved wolfpack isn't represented :-\, but give me the 1945 ARMY team with that AWESOME wishbone rushing attack!

Not a bad sim. Works well for recreating seasons or running things like fictional playoff tournaments.

Entertaining but flawed.  Penn State '69 can beat Texas '69 every time by running the exact same play on every down.  Guaranteed touchdown every possession.  Even JoePa wasn't that good.

I found this in my dad's den when I was in Jr. High.  How he came by it, I'll never know.  Played it a ton in the late 70s early 80s and ended up with the copy.  Am now teaching my 8 year old who's a sports nut.  We're having lots of fun trash talking and playing our favorite teams, albeit with "classic teams."  My son doesn't mind at all...and the wheel keeps on turning.  [Childhood game]

Like Paydirt!, this is a dry football simulation which was really nice in its time but is now a dated chart and dice game.

Can play solitare, fun during football season when your interested in football.  Defense is meaningless though, rarely does the roll give you a result you can use.  Don't lose the dice.

Own this and the pro version (Paydirt). I like Paydirt a little better because there were more teams and seasons. However, we used to have college playoffs with this one and it was fun. Wish I had gotten the second set of teams! Not a lot of strategy, with limited plays to choose from, but still fun.

Dec 2014 - acquired team sets 2 and 3, and started my own 8 team CF playoff tournament!

Owned it for YEARS. We played an entire college season MORE than once.....and for a group of brits thats impressive..Especially as, at the time there wasnt any Gridiron on British TV. The only thing we knew about the game was the rules from Bowl Bound and Statis Pro and what we could gleam from the odd copy of USA today we found occasionally at newsagents.

Like many others, I played an entire season in my youth.  I collected statistics from the games and had an incredible number of enjoyable hours.

I love stats and I love a random factor of the dice roll.  Now I realize that there are better implementations but at the time I LOVED playing this game.

It's great to have a full range of historic teams.  I've been playing this since it game out.  Eddie Mays sells (or at least did recently) modern teams, so you can replay some of the recent classics.  'Bama vs. OSU, anyone?

I played this by myself a lot when I was in school. 
Not much fun with just one person because of knowing what play the other side is calling. Save for playing with interested child?

A fairly decent College Football game.  Teams are represented on charts based on actual performance statistics, so the game can be a bit unbalanced if you choose the [i]wrong[/i] team, but even then, with the right play calls...

Found my father's game (the original Sports Illustrated College Football Game) when I was eight or nine, and played it repeatedly for the next few years.  Later, I'd intermittently pull it out for solitaire tournaments, and even got my wife to play it a couple times.  I don't really play it any longer, and I can recognize its flaws...on the other hand, I could see myself pulling this out in the nursing home in 2060.

Played this game so many times it is difficult to know how many times it has been played. Quick and fun game. I'm now playing this game with my 9 year old son. Its complex enough for me to keep coming back to it, but the playablity is the attration for me.

The same general system as another of the SI games, still was a pretty good time.  Marking the passing time a bit of a pain, as well as the field position.  But we had a pretty exciting game, although neither offesnse really performed up to snuff.

The SI games were terrible.  Little skill, lot's of luck and moronic charts.  This is the worse of all of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My rating is for the game with the original team charts; the later charts provided less realistic results, especially with a 2-player game if the defense guessed wrong. But I played this a lot, especially with a friend, with teams divided into conferences, and with a national championship playoff. We had amazing games that reminded us what an exciting game college football can be. My all-time most memorable game? Late in a game versus Michigan, and coaching 1966 Notre Dame, I pulled a draw play that went for a big gain, called timeout and kicked a long field goal to win by one point. He sat there slack-jawed as the ball sailed through the uprights at Notre Dame Stadium. Although I don't play the game anymore, my rating reflects how much I dug it when I did play. "Bowl Bound" is one fun gaming experience for those who like football.

This and Paydirt play relatively quickly for football sims. Of course, you don't have individual player cards, but you can keep accurate team stats. I disagree with those who complain about the luck of the dice. Like an RL coach, you can't control the outcome but can dictate probabilities. I prefer Paydirt b/c I don't like old school college football, but I see some more recent charts available. It works solo if you design play-calling charts, but then you lose some of the pattern-based strategy, etc.

Playing the best college football teams against each other creates some interesting matchups. Players that rely too much on their best offensive and defensive plays will either dominate or be out-coached.

Dr. Thomas R. Nicely made perhaps the most dynamic tabletop board game for college football when he developed this fine simulation of colorful team charts that involves intense football-related coaching strategy ... and the nostalgia that is listed in paragraph form with each university team chart describing their victory on the gridiron is quite fascinating indeed.  The games move at a rapid pace.  It is a good combination of ease of play mixed with outstanding realism and statistical accuracy!

A very solid simulation of college football, with plenty of strategic play calling. Good for folks who enjoy nostalgic teams from the 60's and 70's, but it's appeal has waned and it has languished on my game shelf for many years now.

I have a weak spot for football simulations and football themed games, and this is a good example.  It's the classic formula of offense and defense both pick a play, and then dice are rolled to see the outcome.  The down and distance are going to determine what plays are best, and certain defenses are better against some plays.  It's not quite as in-depth as [gameid=5740], but it's a lot more intensive than, say, [gameid=17851].  The teams do seem very different, and it is easy to see where strengths and weaknesses are by simply a glance at the relevant charts.  The color coding is a simple but effective way of telling what kind of outcome can happen with any given play call.  It's this transparency that separates it from many of the rest of the football sims.  Really a cool system.

The Starter Kits aren't perfect, I'll grant that, but there is very little chance that I would have ever taken the leap into ASL without them. Nothing matches the depth, variety, and narrative that ASL can provide. The king I tell you.

I extremely enjoyed ASLSK 1, 3 and 2 (in that order) but this one did not do much for me. Most of the scenarios are quite uninspiring and lack the excitement that we have come to expect from ASLSK.

RATING: 8.75
You get a lot for your money in this, which is wrongly named an expansion. This is a standalone kit including 3 new boards and everything you need to play starter ASL rules upto, and including, armour.

RATING: 8
The new rules alone are worth buying this expansion for.

RATING: 7
If you are looking to play some ASL without the monetary or time commitment of the full game this is perfect.  It's also an excellent introduction to the full game.

[b]Advanced Squad Leader: Starter Kit Expansion Pack #1

A Great Introduction Into The World Of ASL, And Enough Of A Game For My Taste[/b]

ASLSKEP#1 (there is a clear pattern of acronyms here, I am not making it up!) gives you more of everything: Infantry scenarios for SK#1, Gun scenarios for SK#2, and Tank scenarios for SK#3. All the while this is a fully self-contained set. A fantastic package, containing one of the most beautiful maps in all SK games (s). I would not recommend starting with EP#1 though, since it is difficult to distinguish the rules that pertain to Infantry/Guns/Tanks. A clear colourcoding would be awesome!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent product, not least because of the diverse range of combatants and equipment included, ranging from Slovakian armoured cars to Italian tanks. Perhaps the best all-round Starter Kit product. 

I've played two scenarios from this pack: Contested Settlement and Converging Assaults. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
7 stars. Would have been more, but the full ASL rulebook composition (4th ed) is actually easier to study than the SK#1... Go figure. The material included however, is excellent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite part of the starter kits remains the rulebook.  This module has an updated one.  Like the others, it's the core of the ASL system in paragraph form which is a nice break from the big rulebook.  Even in this easier form, there is a lot of detail that takes a few playings to soak in.

Being complete and self-contained is a big plus. The rules are not well organized and require careful reading. Use Jay Richardson's tutorials on BGG. This module has a good selection of scenarios.

ASL Starter Kit with updated rules. It comes with the SK3 rulebook with amended errata. A pity the selection of scenarios.

Pros: Full package; overall quality; cheap introduction to the ASL world.

Cons: selection of scenarios.

Played three scenarios from this pack and didn't love any of them.  The Polish-Slovak confrontations, while novel, are very fragile with a few hot (or not) die rolls rapidly deciding the outcome and there weren't very many choices for the Poles.  Our third scenario (Not So Disposed) was the most interesting of the bunch for the options it afforded the Italians in how to set up, but the actual game play proved grinding and repetitive.

Continue the Starter Kit journey...a nice summary of how ASLSK have gone so far.  This is a standalone game that can be played right out of the wrapper.  No need to find out the "right" counters to play any of the 8 scenarios contained.  A complete package on its own with the counters from all the nationalities the scenarios require.  A great addition to the hobby and collection.  3 standard mapboards and a complete rulebook, updated to the latest known errata.  Plus, they cover all rules in ASLSK environment!  I am not a big fan of the system but this package really calls me to game it!

Now the best way to get into the ASL starter series, being that it has everything to act as a stand alone game. Most importantly, its the best way to add the tank rules and counters without having to dig up a copy of the #3 starter kit, which seems to be pretty rare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent addition to the SK series. Gives the new player a light and easy taste of AFV's and guns. Still seriously lacking from the goodness that is ASL, but definitely serves it's purpose as a springboard for new players to get there.

These starter kits really help ease the pain of learning ASL. Still not as fun as the original Squad Leader but this set is probably the closest ASL has gotten to recapturing the fun and simplicity of SL. I still prefer playing SL (with CoI) over ASLSK but if you are determined to learn ASL this is by far the best way to wade into the waters (but you will probably still need to find someone to teach you the game when you are ready to go past the SKs).

I give this an 8 because this is a top notch product that should have been released long ago. The rules are clear and well written with generous illustrated examples of play. The SKs give you enough rules, units and scenarios to stand on their own. I suspect that with all three SKs you could have years of fun without needing to move on to full ASL.

Generous of MMP to make the game a complete stand-alone game.

RATING: 7
Take my rating with a grain of salt as we played it with a hybrid of ASLSK and Retro rules.  Playing straight out of the box (bag?) the rating would be a bit lower, if we bothered to play it at all.  That aside there are some enjoyable scenarios in this package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Based on SK1 plays. I know that I would play this everday of my life if I could, but there are just too many other games out there to try. I can't commit to the lifestyle. Maybe once I retire!

If  you want to just stay with starter kits and not get into full ASL, this is a fine addition  for  its unusual units and well worth getting.

Some really different scenarios (two of which can be played as a mini-campaign!) make this a must-have addition to the ASLSK universe.  Includes new Axis and Allied Minor units.  Great pack.

Almost a Starter Kit 4. It adds eight new scenarios, complete with rules, maps and more than five nationalities. Tactical scenarios from early World War II period to late ones. Very well organized, it adds Infantry, support weapons, guns and vehicles combat. An all around kit and the preferable way to go in all the ASL Kits.

Skipped ASLSK #3 and jumped to this one for the rulebook alone. It's nice to have all the core rules in one, easier to read, easy to carry, easy to hold rule book to refresh with.  The boards look good and the scenarios, at first glance, look interesting.  The Italian armor is nice to see sense I don't own Hollow Legions.  However, I doubt I'll play this much as I like most of the chrome of full ASL.

and so it begins. tight, concise rules. while counters and art are decidedly yester-year, they have a timeless, utilitarian aesthetic. while i wish the components were thicker and bigger, i have a greater appreciation that MMP simply continues to support this game and makes it easier for new players with the SK modules.

Very good stand alone game that gives you much of the info that really should have been included in the first 3 starter kits but was'nt. In fact if you want to buy ASLSK 1, 2 or 3 for the maps, counters and scenarios make sure buy this at the same time and dont bother reading the previous sets of rules and tables as this is by far the best illustrated and most complete set available.

This evokes the book superbly, but all seems a bit too processional for my liking and once you've cracked it that's it. This may seem a strange comment given that we haven't cracked it yet but I have no real desire to explore further.

RATING: 7.5
Very immersive for being so abstract.  My 6 year old is really into this game right now too.  I'm a little worried about re-playability in the future, but maybe that won't be a probem with expansions.

Both my son and I prefer this to Pandemic.  Because it traces an eventful journey, I think we both feel a sense of achievement every time we play, even when we lose.  In Pandemic, however, losing the game just feel like losing - it's much more frusterating.

130923 it's another great knizia especially outstanding as the first of this modern age of coops.  I'd say its an excellent distillation of the Lotr story...both abstract and refined and yet thematic.  Captures the linear path of the story but doesn't feel overly scripted.

Worst Co-Op ever...quite boring, and haven't felt a challenge one bit. It feels, smells, and plays like a Kinizia game. For better co-op try Ghost Stories or what not...but I guess Lotr theme just does it for some people (in which case I recommend the cooperative card game instead).

I've played this many times now, and it's starting to wear on me.  It has not gotten better with time.  It's so damn hard and random that it's frustrating.  You can play the best you've ever played and if you happen to draw several event tiles in a row at just the wrong time - oops, game over.  This is especially true in Mordor.

Quite frankly, with games like Pandemic and Shadows over Camelot out there that fix the problems this game has, I'd rather play a different co-op game that doesn't make me so frustrated due to flaws.

Good gravy the rulebook is wretched. This is one of those games that isn't that difficult to play once you know it, but getting there is a steep climb. Also, once you reach the summit, it's not that great of a view. I like that it has beautiful LotR artwork and follows the books suprising well. But it has odd mechanical systems that actually detract from the experience. Challenging, yes. Compelling? Not so much.

The worst instruction booklet I've ever seen. The game stood in my shelf for 1.5 years before I finally got to play it. Before that I read the rules six times and still there were some ambiguous points.

And the game itself? It wasn't the worst experience I've had, but after the game everyone felt like we've seen all the game has to offer. There's just no point playing the same storyline over and over again. I'll get rid of this game.

I'm a pushover for cooperative games.  I guess it hearkens to my RPG days, where you try to work together to beat the board/environment.  This game, despite it just being a bunch of tracks and themed cards, really brings out the feeling of being hunted and dealing with the corruption that the power of the ring causes.  Really fun to play.  I just wish there were more cooperative games out there.  I haven't played it enough to run into the problem some people complain about, where you begin to see patterns and play becomes more constricted.  We'll see, I guess.

Lord of the Euros.

This is Knizia.  He's trying, but in the end, it is a game about collecting tokens and matching symbols.

It has beautiful artwork and it can be solo'd well.  I find it takes about 90 minutes to play and I have to keep refreshing on the rules when I pull it out, so because of that, I don't pull it out more.

It's not bad, but it is a far cry from War of the Ring.

RATING: 7
An interesting coop.  Players play cards to advance the group along various tracks.  All the while players need to balance their increasing corruption against Sauron advances along the corruption track.  The players win if at least the ring bearer survives and successfully destroys the ring.

The players definitely need to work together in order to succeed.  Because of the different character powers, certain players will be better equipped to handle certain obstacles.  Careful orchestration of the group's progression is vital, particularly as the ring bearer must be protected.  Against that, the game provides a series of dangers that become increasingly more difficult and carry and increasingly harsher penalties.  The progression works out very nicely as the difficulty ramps up towards the end of the game.

POSITIVES:  Lots of theme.  If you like LotR, chances are you will like this game.  The coop elements work well -- players *must* work together in order to succeed.

NEGATIVES:  I don't feel a strong connection between the game mechanics and the theme.  It seems like someone said "Hey, it would be cool if we made a LotR board game!  What mechanics sound good?"  I'm sure players can connect the mechanics and theme if they really want to, but to me the mechanics aren't particularly evocative.

A great coop game.  Strongly recommended.  I would gladly play this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Beautiful game, but it's far too random. In order to win you must be lucky. I'm not sure if it's a good idea - making the players strive for a common goal. It would probably have to be very advanced, and not as random, in order to be a good game.

RATING: 8
I'm impressed that our group won this on the first play.  Of course, 3 of the 5 hobbits perished in Mordor, but 2 of us made it, and the other 3 were there till nearly the end.  A fun, cooperative game, that is quite challenging.  It's on to Friends & Foes and the Sauron expansions next week.  We'll see how well we hold together then.

Very unusual game. Some people complaint that they feel that the game is playing them instead of they play the game. I have also this impression, but could be that I just do not understand yet how to play. I bought the Foes and Friend expansion few years ago, but I have never played it, I would like to win first the basic game. Still struggling to win when Sauron starts in position 12 (I do not play it very often). 
Update: This may never happen. I traded the game.

Lord of the Rings has a very strong gameplay, but is quite abstract, which can make it more difficult to bring to the table. But when it does, it creates a great tension, and lots of difficult and interesting choices. I specially like that you will sometimes have to sacrifice yourself to help the fellowship, which I find quite thematic. This player elimination can however be a problem for some, even though you can still participate in the discussion.

The frequent use of dice also increases the feeling of radomness compared to Pandemic, so your enjoyement will depend on how you cope with dice-induced randomness. I lost on Mount Doom because of a unlucky roll, but it was an exciting everybody stands up to watch moment.

Difficulty can be easily adjusted, but I have the feeling that at 2-player the original rules are really punishing, I need to confirm this with more plays.

The playing boards are very beautiful, and variability comes from token draw. A pity that events are fixed.

another cooperative game and probably the game that turned me back onto this form of games, again a horribly challenging game that can give you some nasty surprises, but doesn't have the story element of the events in Arkham Horror, so this one has been left by the wayside a bit. It would probably be worth getting out again, come to think of it.

My copy is beaten to death. New hobbits needed. Unboxed.

RATING: 8
Wonderful cooperative game with a great theme. I rate this highly mostly because of the well integrated theme and the cooperative aspect of the game more so than the actual gameplay. The rules can be a bit convoluted especially with new players so it's best to play with someone who knows the game if at all possible. Sometimes this game really hits the sweet spot with all the players really working together and things are coming down to the wire in terms of whether the group will make it or not. It conveys the tension of the original story very well. Of course, then there are those times when nothing is going right and you know about half way through the game that you are going to lose.

After finally destroying the ring, I can safely give the game an 8. It's all about minimizing your risks and cooperating with your friends. I feel that the event tiles provide a little too much randomness for me to grant it a higher rating though.

Update:
Dropped to a 7.5. After more plays, I'm beginning to feel as if my group's single victory was because of luck only. Right now, LOTR is a game that I feel we will play in the future but not very often.

Update 2: Flatline 7.0

Update 3: Upon furthering pondering...why the hell is this LOTR themed at all?

A very well-themed game. To those who say it isn't, I challenge you to take the identical mechanics and apply a different theme to them!

Very, very tense, and knowing whether you've won or not might be down to the wire. I like that players are frequently willing to take a hit for the team, and even die: I can't think of any other cooperative that has this element.

I'm very surprised at how low LotR is rated. Most people say it's because it's an "older" game, and can't compare with the "newer" cooperatives; but it's considerably better than Pandemic, and considerably less abstract! For a real nightmare, play it with five players!

Too bad about the rulebook, though....

I just don't like cooperative games. All my gaming buddies love this game. I am the only one who doesn't. The cooperation in this game seems minimal to me. For the most part, the newbies cannot contribute anything since the experienced players will tell them what to do. Even if all the players were experienced, the decisions that the players had to make involved no strategy or tactics. The decisions involved a minimal calculation of the odds. The game just seemed incredibly boring luck dependent game where depending on the draw of the tile you might or might not escape a particular board.  I just don't see any meaningful cooperation. It's like using four (# of players) brains to do a job one can do. There is no private information or personal talent that we bring to the table. Any one person who can see everyone's cards can arrive at the same decision which all the players invariably arrive at. There is no synergy, there is no welfare improvement. What a waste of my time. The game would function just as smoothly if I was comatose and one of my teammates played my cards for me. A genuine cooperative experience is when everyone has an input, like in a team sport or in research. Playing these kinds of games are like going for a movie with friends. The theme may be fun and we're there together but it's not a much of a group accomplishment. I suspect that most people enjoy the game because of the theme. If we changed the theme to one which they didn't enjoy then the game's rating would plummet.

I've tried to give this game a chance, but I just don't feel like I have any control over it.  Players who know the game better than others will steer the team strategy, causing me to feel like little more than a tile-drawing card-holding drone.  Between the card draws, the dice rolls, and the tile pulls, victory just seems too random for me.  Maybe I'd feel differently if I knew the game better, but I just don't feel the need to do that.  There are other fish in the sea.

It's a very abstract card game where you play four different symbols, and that's almost all there is. The progression of events and special card distributions adds some interesting tension that follows the "story" of Lord of the Rings. But they don't really change the gameplay at all.

You are invited to "feel" the theme of LOTR in the game's narrative arc. And it can be fun if players build the narrative themselves as they play. But I can't rate the game itself highly for doing that. It merely provides the opportunity for creative storytelling on top of some very light and dry gameplay.

I expected so little from this game. The rules sounded so abstract.

Boy was I wrong!

This game provides SO much fun. And tension. Our friends love this and so do we. And playing together is a novel and sociable experience.

UPDATE: Dropped to a 9.5, because it's quite tense and thinky. So the thought of playing this is seldom appealing (even though we always always enjoy ourselves when we do get down to a game).

UPDATE: Dropped a bit further... With so many good games out these days, I have to be more critical.

Thought it was pretty cool the first few times I played it. Unfortunately it soon began to feel very samey and I have no real desire to play it ever again. I suppose the cooperative gameplay was revolutionary for the time but it has not aged well compared to cooperative games like Pandemic.

Fantastic Mechanic. I believe it´s a great game on it´s own, but it has limited replay value. Each expansion adds new elements that increase it´s replay value. They should keep making more expansions, so the original users go back at it and play the game again. If someone get the game with all expansions, they won´t play as much, because the´re (most likely) going to use all expansions right away.

I'm always a little dubious about games (or anything else)that sell themselves on the back of an already proven masterpiece. Regrettably, this is another case of well meant intentions falling short.
I'm all in favour of playing co-operatively, which indeed we did; but despite our best efforts, we were subject both to the cards we drew, and the cards that turned up against us. When you've worked as a team, made it through to the final board with relative ease, only to find the cards crapping all over you at the last moment, the question has to be "Why did we bother ?". We did nothing wrong, and there was nothing that we could have done to prevent the seemingly inevitable slaughter (four really awful cards in a row).
In short, too much chance, too little control. Nice art, shame about the game.

The hobbit slaughter.  I've played this one a few times and I upped my initial rating of 7.5 to 8 after playing with the full complement of five players.  Players really have to work together to make this game play well and discuss the merits of all their options to get ahead.  Tough game, I haven't won though to the end once yet.

Wasn't sure of this one when I bought it but we had a lot of fun playing. One thing I liked was there's enough incentive to play selfishly in this co op game to keep people playing instead of discussing strategy. 1st game was very close. 2nd game we just dominated  Sauron so maybe the game isn't very replayable.

RATING: 4
Mixed feelings about this coöp game. I have the feeling that the game misses a bit of balance, although I can not really tell how to fix it. All in all, I think it still is far to dependend on luck to keep it fun. You can play very well, but with two unlucky dice rolls the game can suddenly end (as we experienced), which leaves you a bit with a punch in the stomach. 
If you like coöp, I think pandemic is much more balanced and less dependend on luck. Some luck is Always involved, but it needs balance..

Entertaining co-op of just the right weight for a randomly assembled group of housemates -- though after winning on "hard mode", I have really no desire to play it ever again.  Really the only time where I've ever felt like I beat a board game and so somehow used it up.

I am a fan of cooperative games, but dislike Pandemic for some reason. 

This game appeals to me thematically, although it is literally a disguised euro game. That said, I love the experience it provides, as well as its overall simplicity. 

Unlike in other coop games where certain characters may be overpowered, this game distributes your group's resources and literally forces you to make sacrifices as a group in overcoming some of the obstacles. As a result, my partner and I love the feeling when we manage to beat the game together.

Reiner Knizia...mechanics, mechanics, mechanics. It's not that it doesn't work, it's just not terribly relevant to the supposed theme of the game. Fortunately, here it works decently, as players are on a quest down a long, harrowing road. The repetitiveness of the mechanic is made somewhat more bearable by calling it thematic. Still...not often played when other games are available.

Mein erstes Koop-Spiel und dann noch HDR Thema.
Habe es jetzt nach vielen Jahren wieder entdeckt, dass man es auch als herausforderndes HDR-Solospiel spielen kann.
Warum bin ich da eigentlich nicht eher darauf gekommen? Anstelle mit den (mehr oder weniger) unmotivierten Mitspielern lange die gemeinsame Züge auszudiskutieren (ohne dabei als Spielediktator alle anderen zu knechten...) direkt 2 bis 4 Hobbits selber durchs Spiel zu führen.
Die 1te Erweiterung [thing=2449]Die Feinde[/thing] passt ganz gut zum Grundspiel.
Die 2te Erweiterung [thing=22884]Schlachtfelder[/thing] bring dann noch eine komplexere Spielmechanik rein die ich jedoch bisher nicht wirklich ausprobiert habe.

I enjoy this with a group as long as it doesn't descend into one player calling the shots.  With the right group, this can be a fun game of staying vaguely in character and hoping that someone will have the cards needed to avoid whatever horrible event is about to befall the fellowship.

In contrast, I also don't mind playing solitaire, where there is exactly one player to call the shots, and it feels almost more like a puzzle than a game.

I love cooperative games and this is one is a classic.

The only problem is that it feels solvable.  When I started I was eager to play it again and again until we solved  it -- like a puzzle.  After that we started winning regularly and then lost interest.

But now, after having left it for a few years, I've forgotten it and I'm involved in trying to solve it again.  So it works in that sense.

After the third game, my outlook on this has radically changed. When played cooperatively and by the rules, Lord of the Rings is a tense team struggle with a sense of weight to each and every decision. We made it to Mordor but Sam, the ring-bearer, was overtaken by Sauron. So close!

So here's something I never thought I'd say: I'm really looking forward to my next game of Lord of the Rings.

Here's something I never thought I'd hear, but did: C--- asked me to buy a copy of a game.

As as cooperative game - it rocks.  Does a great job of catching the feel of the story.  As a game, play experience will depend on the players.  It seems that some players can't get over the cooperation aspect of the game and thus create a great deal of added pressure to the fellowship.  In the right situations, a fun experience.  In others, a real feeling of futility can emerge.  (was this by design?)  [GTI Code: TGCL]

One co-op to rule them all! Okay, Lord of the Rings may have been surpassed, by a number of games bearing its DNA, but this still holds up...it's still fun. The tense marriage of decisions, sacrifices, and luck of the draw here don't age all that much, and the mechanics are quite elegant and unique even to this day with how you shift through the different Conflict boards. Beautiful production, I only wish there were some expansion content for this edition.

Great cooperative game.  It's weird that, although I usually despise excessive randomness in my games, the random (and potentially hazardous) tile draws don't bug me one bit.  Perhaps it's because, instead of luck destroying one individual's chances of winning, the GROUP has to collectively deal with the luck element.  The rules are a tad fiddly, especially with the expansions, but this is altogether a refreshing experience.

Knizia's abstract co-operative game, set in Tolkien's Middle Earth. It was enjoyable enough, being neither too long or too short and with enough decisions too keep it interesting.

The biggest problem for me is a somewhat cliche criticism of the Good Doctor's games: that of its seeming themelessness. Generally, I don't have a problem with Knizia's themes or even themelessness in general, but here ... the game felt mostly empty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's hard to dislike any game that looks this nice if you're a Tolkien fan. Apart from some truly rubbish tokens, it's gorgeous. It's also unique in my collection in terms of gameplay, but given you play through the same adventure every time, I suspect it will have limited lifespan. However, the thing I love most about it is that you rarely win! Any game in which the baddies are horrendously poised to win and then don't 'because the goodies have to win', is lame. This game is one for the baddies, who really deserve it given the starting odds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
One play so far. It's really not "all that", quite far from, and really far from what I'd expected from Knizia. But ot the other hand it's really really /really/ exciting. It's really easy to get into the real fellowship state of mind, and we-just-have-to-destroy-the-ring-or-else-something-bad-will-hit-the-fan!!! Seems like Reiner knows what he's doing even when he's not doing his regular stuff.

This game genuinely makes me feel I am amongst the hobbits struggling to get the ring to Mordor.  It can be devastatingly difficult to defeat the game, but the cooperative nature of the game makes for great gameplay every time.  One major rap on this game is that it is possible for one player to tell everyone else what to do thus eliminating any real cooperative feel.  However, since I only have played with good friends, this has never been an issue with us.

Not interested in the book, never read or it plan to read it; I've just been meaning to play a cooperative game for a while.  I assumed the girlfriend would hate it but after two defeats we're both desperate to play again and give Sauron a good kicking.  Tense, dramatic and very unforgiving.

RATING: 7.75
This games is considered a classic, and with good reason, though it is a somewhat abstract departure from the action-based offerings that typically bear this timeless theme. That being said, the theme is readily present throughout the gameplay experience, and the blend is expertly crafted by a master of board game design. This original version is not as graphically refined as subsequent releases, but it is the only version that supports the original expansions -- which is invaluable -- and it certainly has a charm all its own.

I did not care for this game the first few times that I played it, but it has grown on me over time. The theme is represented pretty abstractly, but it still manages to capture the feel of the books quite well. Best played with Tolkien fans.

RATING: 1
Released amongst the hoo haa of Peter Jackson's movies, this was an eagerly awaited co-operative game (of which I am usually a fan).

Unfortunately what Knizia created was a puzzle rather than a game and once you've figured out the best approach to each board the puzzle's finished (whether you succeed or not is then based on the luck of the tile draw.)

You can start with a different selection of hobbits to vary the puzzle but it never becomes a game.

Good, very good, it's really dificult to win as it has to be in a cooperative game. One of the best cooperatives games I've played.Very funny to play it. It's good that you go changing the board (levels) during the game.

My first co-op game. I like it overall, but tile mechanic feels too random. I've tried few times but still haven't won the game even in easy mode without using a variant. Also, the characters to be used is determined based on the number of players, so replayability doesn't seem to be very high.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
10 co-op plays without expansions. *See Plays for details. LOTR is basically a "social" game.  I normally prefer playing strategy games, but I find myself in the mood to play this "choose your own adventure" more often than one would expect.  As for the gameplay, the luck of the draw and die rolls heavily determines your score, but it also adds intensity and excitement.  Although playing with an expansion is preferable, I continue to play and enjoy the base game on occasion.  I recommend using only 1 expansion at a time. Playing with more than one expansion adds considerable length to the game!  We usually play with Sauron on space 15.  We really only use Watchful Peace and The One Ring with the Sauron expansion.

I much prefer playing Lord of the Rings with 2 players or solo, in some cases having players control more than 1 Hobbit (unless we're using the Sauron expansion.)  My reasoning is that Merry or Pippen may not even get a turn until the second or third scenario board.  Also, there can be way too many opinions as to what to do, which can slooow down the game.   


[b]Friends & Foes[/b] 
25 co-op Plays!  I really enjoy starting with Bree as the first scenario.  The additional features add more flexibility for the Fellowship.  

[b]Sauron[/b]
5 Plays!  Intense fun, but also provides an overwhelming feeling of doom and despair.  Much harder than the base game!


[b]Dark Events[/b] 
2 solo plays with 2 Hobbits using only the Base game without expansions!  Enjoyable, but now even more difficult to overcome the Events in Mordor.       


[b]Battlefields[/b]
4 solo plays and 3 co-op plays!  At the moment I prefer the Battlefield combat to the card removal combat found in Friends & Foes.

RATING: 7
This game is fun but I'm tired of getting my butt kicked at it.  Last few plays felt repetitive but I understand there are many expansions we have yet to try out.  Of course, most games will suffer from repetitive play if you wear them out, so my complaint is not really against the game itself.  The choices you make on your turns do seem to be predetermined however, and with the events track you are always aware of the next nasty thing to come smack you.  Still, this game is challenging and our group had great fun playing it.

Not a bad gae as such but feels a little lite on the theme, the theme makes sense yes but it kind of feels like the theme is just there and any theme could be there it does not absorb like it should and sometimes feels a litte too much like hard work.

[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Spiel des Jahres Special Award: Literary Game 2001[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 8/5/09, Rated: 10[/i]
{2P: ???, 3P: 10, 4P: 10, 5P: ???}

[i]One game to rule them all...[/i]

Let me start by saying this: If you're not a fan of the books and/or the movies, then you are not going to like this game.  If you do enjoy those other mediums, then you will enjoy this.  And if you love the story as I do, then you will be amazed by this game.

[i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] is a cooperative game.  That is to say, all of the players are working together to defeat "the game."  My family enjoys these games as a welcome alternative: we've played [i][thing=15062]Shadows over Camelot[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing][/i].  It was surprising for me to realize that [i]Lord of the Rings[/i] preceded both.  In fact, it is quite apparent to me that its composition of having a main board and then separate scenario boards was heavily leveraged by [i][thing=15062]Shadows[/thing][/i].  Ditto the idea of having a draw deck of tiles that advances the game elements (what [i][thing=15062]Shadows[/thing][/i] would later refer to as "The Progression of Evil").

[person=2]Knizia[/person]-bashers love to say that his games consist of dry mechanics with [geekurl=/wiki/page/Glossary#toc135]pasted-on themes[/geekurl].  That objection goes sideways for me, as I think almost every game can be reduced to those ingredients.  What makes this game so incredible is the richness and depth of the source material, and the effectiveness with which it has been distilled down to a 60-minute gaming experience.  You feel the enormity of the evil that is arrayed against you.  The Big Eye is an imposing figure as it marches down the corruption track towards your hobbits.

Each scenario has its own personality.  Take "Helm's Deep" for example: if the players can rush to complete the "Friendship" line and establish an alliance with Rohan before the second event, then they're off to a good start.  If they can then rush through the "Travelling" line so that the Riders of Rohan reinforce Helm's Deep before the third event, then they will be well-positioned to successfully complete the scenario.  The sense of urgency and the sequencing of these plot lines map well to the literary events, which I appreciate.

This seemingly complex game structure is delivered with a spartan set of components.  The artwork of the game is original and immersive.  This is a game that is easy to teach, and perhaps even more importantly is easy to set up.  It is difficult to win, and by including a scoring mechanism there is motivation to win [i]well[/i].  [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i] was a landmark achievement in 2000, and it still represents a triumph of game design nine years later.

[i]Updated: 7/18/10, Rated: 9[/i]

[i]Lord of the Rings[/i] is an amazing feat of literary adaptation.  If I'm being objective then the one item that provides me with a tiny lingering doubt is how this it favors people who have read the books.  A "10" should have near-universal appeal.  A "9" is still a heavy hitter, and [i]LOTR[/i] will still have plenty of magic for enthusiasts.

Good game for non-gamers I think.  A little abstract at first, but then the system of the game begins to make sense and it is a lot of fun.  I am not all that fired up to play it again anytime soon, and have never played with the Sauron expansion because I like everyone to be on the same team (pansy), and the other expansions make it hard enough!  I will play it again if it is voted on, maybe.  Last time I didn't want to play it, there was some drama, so we'll see what happens.

A wonderful cooperative game, and not a bad solitaire!  Dripping with theme, and still an awesome game with difficulty scaling depending on who's playing.  We are still wimps at beating Sauron though.
  
I keep this game around for the theme, the production, and the cooperative aspect.  You really do feel like you're two-to-five hobbits trying to survive the slings and arrows of the book, and with Sauron set at the proper starting place, the game is a real life or death struggle.  (Speaking just in game terms.)

Great cooperative game, and there isn't very many of those around here. Quality boards, ugly plastic figures. Quite fun game mechanics, with some interaction and teamplay.

I must confess a fondness for Tolkien, so I could be biased.  I felt the feel of the game was great--a race to Mount Doom before you are crushed by the weight of evil.  The cooperative play was a first for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I really like this game mostly because it's so completely different to anything else out there.  It also feels very balanced and still unpredictable even though you're basically playing against the board itself!  And if you don't like that, you can always add the Sauron expansion.  Unfortunately, it takes a couple of plays to really "get" this game, so a lot of my friends are turned off after the first play and don't want to play again.  *Big* pity!

*Update* Oy Vey.  Half tempted to drop my rating to a '6.'  Two very "lucky" games later... bleh... One recent game the hobbits stroll through the game without breaking a sweat.  The other recent game, brother-in-law who humors his wife by playing games gets killed five-minutes into it, I get killed ten-minutes in, and my sister plays alone for 20 minutes by herself until she dies two steps into Mordor.  Very frustrating after having two or three enjoyable sessions. I thought this game was a solid component of my collection but I'll have to re-assess that (especially as a gateway game that includes player elimination).

Fun game.  Was a bit puzzle-like, but that didn't seem to get in the way of the mood.  Very dependent on whether players embrace the theme.

The most enjoyable gaming EXPERIENCE that I have ever had.  I truly feel as though I am a Hobbit experiencing all the dangers and perils that they went through in the books.  I wonder if any game will ever come close to touching Lord of the Rings at the top of my favorite games list.  It has everything I want in a game.

Part of what makes it great is that no one knows for sure which strategy is the best, so players have to make up their own minds.  And total cooperation is absolutely necessary, up to and including sacrificing yourself for the team.  Every game I've played has been absolutely delightful, and I find it best played with simply the base game.

I'm impressed with this cooperative game.  The replayability seems like it could be an issue, but playing it once or twice a year seems good.  So far, after 3 tries, my wife and I are really enjoying this game and still have not won.

In the first play, we started Sauron on 15 and mis-played one rule.  That is, we forced ourselves to only play cards of the same symbol as was flipped on the story tile.  We made it to Mordor, but barely.

In the second play, I believe we had all the rules straight.  We put on the ring a few times (which we didn't do the first time through) and it helped.  We started Sauron on 14 and made it near the top of Mt. Doom.  I put on the ring to, hopefully, climb the last 4 spaces.  Unfortunately, I rolled the discard 2 cards symbol on the die and had no cards.  So, I met my demise and we lost (since I had the ring).

In the third play, we really zipped through Moria and Helm's Deep.  Shelob's Lair was a bit tougher, but we weren't too close to Sauron (started on 14) so we were feeling good.  The events in Mt. Doom took a toll on us and Sam (who had the ring) was unable to discard 2 cards on an event so he fell and we lost.  Once again, our loss was due to not being able to discard cards.

After 3 consecutive losses, we won our fourth play in a resounding victory.  It wasn't even close.  We had tons of Runes and were quite a distance from Sauron.  We were shocked at how easily we won.  Sauron started on 14 again... guess it's time to move him to 12 at game start.

My favorite novel based game.
Player Aid: http://www.bggfiles.com/viewfile.php3?fileid=2703   A good aide that incorporates the base game and both expansions (with the expansion rules marked in different colors, so you can use one aide for all combinations you desire!) It is big, though.

RATING: 8.5
Have had SOFA King many fun nights with this. We've only won a few times, because one of our squad is like Gollum (Paul-lum I've dubbed him) and he hoards his precious "good cards I'm saving for later!". Other than all of us castigating him and slapping him unconscious after each loss: It's a FAB game. Get it.

EMOTICON REVIEW: :sauron:

I think that in a couple of plays it will get boring and repetitive.(it did)
I will check out the expansions probably.I can't understand why so many votes on medium and medium heavy weight.It is straight forward with clear rules and lots of luck.It is the definition of a light game.Good for non-gamers also.

First time with 3 players.It was a lot easier but still boring.

We play every evening with our kids. We did manage to beat it after 4 sessions but with minor errors in the rules. Great game for kids 7+

Rating goes from 4 to 6

RATING: 7
This is a hard one to rate. It is a very unique type of game. It’s a puzzle; its multi-player solitaire, it&#039;s fun and it does get very intense towards the end. The only reason that I don&#039;t rate it higher is that it doesn&#039;t feel like you making very many tough decisions throughout the game. At the end there are usually a couple of nail-biting moments but not enough decision conflict to be truly great.

RATING: 6.8
I am not a big fan of co-op games and this feels more like a puzzle than a game to me. I will say that (hobbit and Sauron pieces aside) the production is not very good - flimsy card attached too well to the sprues, thin board etc.

After a few plays this is not even my favourite co-op. Feels more luck-driven than Pandemic and as a result I have never felt the 'if only' feeling you get at the end of a good co-op.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Besides the stunning artpieces and the nice retro-looking materials, Lord of the Rings is a colorless game: it’s deprived of any strain and most of the actions you take feel like they’re the only allowed.

Like most of the many games by the same author, Lord of the Rings feel cold, soulless and dull: it surely lacks the original source’s warmth, mirth and wonder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simply a ton of fun.  The new Silver line one has great components, with amazing art work. I like the length of the game, and the flow of how turns work.  The mechanics also seem to fit the theme very well.

We'll see if this score last, but as of right now i am really liking this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The granddaddy of all co-op games!  This game is delightful.  It's richly detailed with elements from the book and it really captures the theme of LOTRs quite well.  You really feel like hobbits struggling to make the long and treacherous journey to Mount Doom to destroy the ring.  The game requires selfless play, teamwork, sacrifice and a little luck.  I'm not the biggest fan of co-op games but this one is particularly great.  The rules are nice and simple, but offer lots of choices to the players.  Most of the time when something bad happens it's usually the result of the players and not the game.  I can't say enough good things about this one.  I will always want to play it and it just might be my favorite co-op game of all time.

I like it.  Fine with two players, but in that case it's only worth an occasional play.  More fun with more; I've played it twice with four players and enjoyed it.

I can see how people can play it out, though.  I can imagine each game would play out very similarly.  I'm not surprised, then, that there are so many expansions.

MUST...BEAT...SAURON!

Sept 2015 - The game took a leap now that I've been playing F&F. 

As we played, I had an realization that each board really mirrored the story.  In Shelob's lair, we realized we had to get hiding done before we should move on the main board. Helm's deep, we gathered up friends before really progressing.

It clicked and it bumped my love of the game up to a 10.  After 24 plays and now it clicked is quite amazing.  Haven't beaten F&F yet on 15.  

I dislike co-ops in general and this is the only one I have liked.

RATING: 6
I like this game but most of my friends don't. I think it has something to do with this game being based on 'cooperation' and 'team work' rather than 'doing each others legs' and 'stabbing your friends in the back' Perhaps I need new friends?

Interesting co-op game with a good theme that works well with the game mechanics. It's all about getting your ring bearer to mount doom trough various trials and tribulations, before the eys of sauron mullers everyone on the darkenss track or whatever it is that it moves down, relentlessly! Not a bad game, but I have played better co-ops.

The cooperative aspect is pretty cool. The board showing the "corruption" of the hobbits really fits with the Lord of the Rings source material.

However, this game is just WAY too complex, abstract, and boring. I would be willing to play this game again,  ONLY if I had some friends that were just dying to play it.

This game does a great job of packing a lot in while staying true to the LotR theme and not taking too long.  Don't expect it to live up to the books though because it can't.  Having a group that is familiar with the movies/novels enhances the game, I find it fun to call people by their hobbit names.

Reiner Knizia did it again.

Another magnificently simple mechanic on a game I simply can't win. Great production values add to a game that is incredibly simple to play, but blisteringly hard to win. In 7 total plays, I have never made it to the final spot on the Mordor scenario board, but I didn't care. I still had a ton of fun, but it seems to be a good thing that I was not responsible for disposing of the One Ring.

Excellent cooperative game.

I suspect that this was intended to be a thematic game.  While I'm not a fan of the license source, I am familiar with it and I did not see how this was really supposed to be related to Lord of the Rings.

I must say that this is one of the most revolutionary games I have ever played. There is no other game I can compare with and I have never seen anything like it before (maybe Shadows of Camelot would be similar but I have never played that game and it came out a few years after Lord of the Rings). I have only played it with 2 players and failed every single time. The game plays itself and it is like solving a puzzle. I would like to try this out with more players to see if the chances of success would improve (I think they will). I do wonder about the replayability of the game. It seems to me that once you beat the system you are done, then again you do have a bunch of expansions (probably for that same reason).

My only perfect-10.  For me, this game is Arkham Horror in an hour with a lot more suspense and a lot more "oh no, don't turn over that next card."  Also, I think there is more opportunity for strategy and tactics (although it is still not that heavy a game).  My only negative for this game is that it is difficult to teach non-gamers.  But as a solo game, it is one of my three favorites (LoTR, Pandemic, AH).

Adult Play = 8; Solo Play = 10;
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Revised:  after five more plays of this game (total of 6), I will stick with my first impression:  the game plays me.  I should like it - it has theme and great player interaction (especially as the hobbits start moving towards Sauron) but for me, it has the appeal of a magic 8-ball taped to a vending machine.  I have played the base game, the friends and foes, and the Sauron expansion and none have hit the sweet spot with me.

I played this once or twice and just couldn't see the point. It was the first Knizia game I played and we didn't want to go near another Knizia game with a ten foot pole for  along while after. Struck us as so much blantant capitalisation on the movies trilogy as you could imagine. "We need a board game, Reiner could you whip one up for os, that's nice for family types" - "Sure thing dudes, here's something I scratched on the back of some fish and chips paper last night, go with it, just send me a royalty check" ;-).

RATING: 7.5
Update:  this one doesn't hit the table very often, and so when it does, we tend to forget some of the rules, which is really annoying.

This game gives me the feeling of cooperating in the face of near-certain doom.  Great art on the boards and cards.  It doesn't feel like a smooth-flowing game -- lots of possible interrupts.

[Bought 2nd hand from roger:bradspel.net 2010-07-07]
Played single player to get the feel of the game.
I think this is a good cooperative game. You get the feeling that to win in this game you need a very tight coperation between the players. 
As the feeling quit quickly gets to hinder the players getting too close to Sauron and still playing to reach the goal.

The feeling is though that the game might loose some playability when you get a grip on how to play it.

Hobbits travel through Middle Earth following the path of the Fellowship and the Ring to Mount Doom.  If the hobbits get corrupted enough on the main track, they fail.  If they hang in to the end, they can destroy the ring.  Mostly cards with hand management.

Like many of Knizia's games the theme here is pasted on and doesn't really add anything to the game. Sadly, the theme was the biggest draw for me. I love Tolkien, but this game doesn't really do the trilogy justice. The mechanics and the gameplay are ok, but nothing really spectacular. It is very challenging however, and if you're a co-op nut who loves a good challenge, it's affordable enough to go pick up and try!

Rating based on one six-player game with base game, Friends and Foes, and Sauron.  Playing Frodo, I felt like I spent a lot of time waiting for my turn and then didn't get to make any meaningful decisions.  If I'm going to play a co-operative game I'd much rather play Shadows over Camelot.

Not as good as hype; I don't understand how this can possibly be rated a 10. On the plus side, some quality components (cards, artwork, boards) and a good theme. On the negative side: some very poor components (flimsy plastic hobbits), a confusing rule book, and superfluous item gathering subplot for each scenario (each character must colllect a sun, a heart and ring in each scenario). 

Worst of all is the hideously random event tile mechanism that can and will screw over any attempt to win the game.

More of a solitaire puzzle than a game IMHO.

Nice co-op game. From playing it so far, very hard to win. Quite a bit of luck or not with the event cards you turn over. Then again in a real adventure it would be luck in what you come across next. Lovely art work on the scenario boards.

I really, really want to like this game more.  But I just can't.  If there was more to it, if the scenarios were different every time, if luck didn't play such a strong part, I'd love it.  I mean, a co-operative resource-management game for the Tolkein license, with artwork by John Howe and game design by Reiner Knizia?  Wow.  But, sadly, not for me.  Maybe the expansions improve the game a lot, I don't know.

Surprising: a Knizia's game with some theme (aided by superb components and illustrations) and a cooperative game I like. Here, all players must work together and even make sacrifices for the good of the group. The game can be quite difficult, specially if you don't roll well. I doubt it works for non-LotR fans, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only solo plays, which I'm not counting here, so more data is required for sure. I'm still hoping to get some other human beings interested in this. 

Very well designed machine, as Dr. Knizia is known for, but I also enjoy the thin skin of theme that is here, which is more than what most Knizia games have. There is a great tension to this game that is different from more modern co-op games, but the genre is so deep now that I'm afraid this one has faded from all memory. It's not one that can go toe to toe with the newcomers in the genre looks wise, but its mechanisms are still fairly unique, just BLAND, as I often find with games designed by the Doctor.

Bought the game in the summer of 2007 and it took me two years to get the game on the table. I had heard some good reviews of the game and it was not a disapointment. It's simple enough to be a game for the whole family but it's also quite tough thus making it good for gamers as well.

We didn't make it to Mountain of Doom but maybe next time we'll be more lucky...

It is fairly thematic, though if you're not careful its abstract nature will suck all the fun out of the experience.  I cannot escape the feeling that the game is pre-programmed; that the order of the tiles (which is set by shuffling at the beginning of each scenario) determines whether you'll win or lose, FAR more than clever play on your part.  I really love Tolkien so there's a soft spot for this game, but I honestly think Pandemic's a better cooperative title - there's more you can do to influence the order of the "bad stuff", so more interesting choices.

This is one of my first forays back into board gaming.  It's quite good, but took me a while to get used to the mechanic of the cards (what they did, when to hold vs when to use and the like).  The first time we lost miserably.  The next several times we've won seemingly without too much trouble...  Perhaps we're missing something in the rules.  It's worth playing, but I was looking for something that felt more like Frodo's journey and this isn't that.  Still it's fun to play.

A co-operative game where all players struggle to dump the ring. The mechanics can dump a lot of bad karma on you very quickly. The abstract mechanics take a bit of getting used to and some aspects are very non-book-like (in particular, the way the ring bounces from player to player). Still, a nice challenge and enjoyable game.

We got this after I read the design comments by Knizia in a game design book, thought it would be interesting, even though I'm pretty skeptical of the fun-value of co-op games these days.  We were really hoping for a game that redeemed our even greater distrust of Knizia, but... redemption denied!  We played 5 games of this, 3 or 4 at the beginner level, and only came close to winning once!  This thing is next to impossible to win - at the very least, it is VERY difficult, and I can't really see too many strategies for doing better.  Hold onto your cards and try to make them last - duh!  But beyond that, it seems like the play is very tilted toward chance, and I'm pretty ambivalent about the abstracted nature of the goings-on.  Nice components, love the idea of multiple boards, there is a lot to like - we just never had any fun.  Can this thing be won?  We're sick of trying.  Knizia, you're killing us here.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting, abstract co-op that integrates just enough thematic flavor into the cards and boards to really convey the LOTR world very well. It's neat that you get to take cards specifically related to locations from the books as you arrive at those spots on the board. The artwork, of course, is also great. I have yet to beat the game, and would like to play with more than two players, but I've enjoyed it so far. Not my favorite LOTR game, but a good one nonetheless.

Sure, there's a lot of luck in the game, but I still enjoy it.  There is a lot of tension and I think it does a good job of portraying the hopeless task of taking the Ring to Mt. Doom.  We've won a couple times, but not everyone survived.  There are interesting discussions when it comes down to who will sacrifice themselves for the good of the group.

Gorgeous graphics.  Landmark title for reproducing the theme and feel of the books so well.  The game is 90% random chance, however, which makes it more into a group activity than a strategy game.  You can make all the right / optimal choices and still lose miserably by drawing a bunch of event tiles in a row.  The expansions do not change this.  I enjoy playing it maybe once or twice a year as something different, but no more than that.

I thought it was confusing at first, playing co-operatively. But with a few plays, I'm starting to come around. The strategy seems to be fairly predictable after a while, though. Contrary to what others may say, I don't think this is a good game to use when first introducing non-gamers to themed family games. It's just too different from anything else they've likely experienced.

I also have the Melkor-Bradley spoof, and rate that about a 5. It's roll-and-move with card chaos, but fun every once in a while.

Anyone who's read the books will find a lot here to like; which fan wouldn’t enjoy the challenge of being a hairy toed impediment to the forces of shadow?  Absolutely lovely production too.

Very tough to win, so expect to lose (probably badly) at least at first.  

I've been looking forward to trying again after the recent slew of good co-op games as they have probably got us more in the right frame of mind for this.  First time round not having an opponent other than the game seemed very strange but, in retrospect, it was enviable innovation from Knizia; though I haven't noticed him getting much credit for it.

On replaying, it's still tough but I've upped my rating a notch - hopefully we can play again soon to see if we can avoid the rookie errors.

While I found the game certainly gave me the feeling of going on an adventure, I also found that if I wanted to win, I needed to simply spam the centre line. Which is fun the first few times you do it, as you see that your plan worked, but after that it just becomes going through the motions.

Found it uninteresting and not even the slightest bit thematic.  Low on strategy and high on blah..

Repaying it now several years later...actually, I'm finding it a lot better than my first go around. It isn't all that thematic, but the with the right imaginative leap it almost works as Tolkien. As a game, it feels like a puzzle in need of solving (the rating of which may go down after it's solved), but I am enjoying the process. Knizia does this simple euro shit right.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed my time with this game before other co-ops existed, but it got pretty left by the wayside once Pandemic, etc., arrived on the scene. And there's a good reason for that: it's not particularly good.

The care with which the events of the novels are depicted is quite nice. Despite being mechanically unthematic the flavor text and board art manage to be extremely evocative... at least for the Tolkien enthusiast like me.

Less evocative is the card and token art which are exceptionally ugly. And the ring is atrocious as well. I'd rather have it NOT fit around the Hobbit figurines and look like an actual ring. Ugh.

Mechanically, though... the main strategy seems to be to have played the game before and remember what cards you will need later. It's normal to have an advantage in any kind of content-based game due to familiarity with said content, but this seems to be the whole strategy, which is just poor design.

There can be moments of nice tension, especially toward the end, but the game feels weirdly all-or-nothing about hurting you. Because of the way event tiles work, you're likely to get a string of terrible flips you can do nothing about (tangent: the tiles are irritating to shuffle between games. Should have been cards) and just get wrecked, OR you'll have a few turns in a row where nothing bad really happens. There isn't the slow build of Bad that happens in games like Pandemic or Ghost Stories, so it ends up feeling like it's harder to plan for, and sometimes feels more unfair on an emotional level, even though that's not necessarily actually the case.

Also, I find it odd that one of the first things you have to do is discard your cards or harm yourself. Starting out with something so punishing... I feel like if I had to take the punishment ever, I would just want to restart because it's the very beginning so why not?

The one thing I do like about the game mechanically is the Gandalf cards. Looking at those vs. the board events is the one thing that feels like it allows you to do some actual planning, instead of just hoping you draw the right cards.

All in all, this is a game I'm pretty much always down to play, but would almost never suggest over Pandemic/Ghost Stories/etc.

An overproduced but simplistic cooperative set collection game spiced up with rules-altering special items/events. As with Knizia's other designs, the theme is almost completely disconnected with what one actually does in the game - draw tiles, push marker(s), collect tokens with symbols, discard cards/tokens with symbols, roll a die occasionally ... oh, it says to discard cards/tokens again ... repeat. Until Sauron kills the hobbits.

I know Steve will give me crap for rating this so low.  The choices in this game are really uninteresting.  Should I play a tree or weapons?  Who gives a crap?  There is very little choice when your hand size is small, and the random things in the game can crush you.  Moving 1-3 spaces on the board is small compared to the bad things that can happen to you.  The bad things are there to make the game an exercise in perfectly modeling a gaussian success rate.  It's a mechanical bell curve that only needs the players to move cards around and nothing else.  There is so much randomness and chaos in the game, that I really felt as if the game would play itself if you set it up and just left it sit on the table.  I didn't feel as if I was cooperating or even really playing anything out of my own wishes.  At least in Shadows over Camelot, you can choose your quest, you can choose how to hurt the group, and there is a player playing against you.  This game is like playing a card game against a computer.  Draw well, win, draw poorly, lose and have no fun doing either one.

Oh, did I mention that I hate The Lord of the Rings movies, and everything the commercialization has sprouted?  Ten years ago, you would hear about somebody reading the story and how good it was....Ok.  You like fantasy books...I have no problem with that.  Now the overhyped and poorly acted and directed movies come out, and suddenly everything has the name Lord of the Rings attached to it.  Even mechanical Knizia games that could fit any theme from Ultimate Fighting Championships to brain surgery.  I liked it better when everything was in Egypt.  The game would still suck.  I would just have more respect for it.

The best game ever made that is completely impossible to win. Sauron will own you the first thirty times you play, no exceptions. Near-flawless game mechanics coupled with high production values make this game sweet. Those Germans, they know their games. John Howe's board illustrations are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. Cooperative element is loads of fun, strategy is deep (though a fair amount of luck for the tiles is needed). Makes you scrutinize the box, wondering "Is this Ravensberger?"

This game fell short of what I had hoped for. There wasn’t really any tension; even though we lost one of the games. Actually, even though I don’t care for theme, this really didn’t feel like we were on a mission to destroy the ring. It was quite mechanical with the card play and there were not really any differences between the various acts/game boards. I like co-op, but this one got traded away very quickly as one of my first games...

I have owned this game since it was originally published by Hasbro before FFG bought it.  I got it because it said "Lord of the Rings" on it.  

What an incredible game.  The mechanics are excellent, and there is a lot of depth to the game.  There is also a high level of tension as Sauron continually moves closer to the left-hand side of the Corruption track, and I can see how important it is for ALL of the players to cooperate throughout the entire game.

An excellent game, and one of Knizia's best.  Will continue to update as I increase my plays and introduce the game to new players.  I have still to play only with my daughter, but the concept seems so finely tuned that I think it can be easy to introduce to the rest of the players in my group.

Another great Knizia game.  I know that some have criticized RK for rehashing the same theme over and over, just pasted onto a different box.  Well, I own only 4 of his games (and will most likely add T&E as a 5th), and none of them are the same at all.  I guess if you don't buy all 250  of his games, the "repitition" factor is diminished.

A real hit. Plays extremely well, and is both funny and exciting. Surprisingly true to the spirit of the story it is based on, it is also a quite satisfying game to play as a solitaire.

Being a cooperative game makes a nice change, and even if your character is killed, you will find yourself still very involved in the game, giving advice to the survivors.

A co-op game that can be very intense at times, at first.  Then you realize what is really happening.  The whole game boils down to the tile draw bag.  All the group decisions made don't make a lick of difference if the tile bag is not kind to you.  Bascially, the game is: Draw 12 tiles 4 times and see if you win. And I don't care for the evil die either.  Its worth playing if you keep track of your high score on the sheet, but as a once every other month kind of game, it sort of sucks.

Pure cooperative games are not my "sweet spot." I played Pandemic numerous times, but only as a solo game. For me, a cooperative game needs some disruption such as a traitor, or the time crunch of Space Alert, to avoid the feel of group puzzle solving.

Having said that, Lord of the Rings is good. It offers theme, it is certainly harsh enough to provide a challenge, and the board flipping with each new challenge is pretty cool. I can see where Shadows Over Camelot really borrowed some neat features from this game. The addition of a traitor, though, makes all the difference.

I have many a fond memory of trying to save hobbits from the relentless corrupting influence of Sauron.  And it's hard to save all of those damn hobbits!  Even with a good amount of planning ahead of time, including setting up who's going to get the ring in Mordor, sacrificing hobbits when it seems necessary, and using Gandalf cards judiciously, it can be hard to get the good guys through.

For the record: I've neither read the books nor seen the movies, but I still found the game entertaining.  I know there are some people who didn't like the game because they weren't familiar with the theme/background, but I'm not in that boat.

Bought at Tradera for 11 SEK.

Okey our first game was a disaster and we lost in Helm's Deep. 
After some talk and understanding the game we gave it another go. But still lost but this time in Shelob’s Lair. 
We tryed it 3 more times but we couldnt survive in Shelob's Lair (we had bad luck drawing alot of events and now we where frustrated on this game.)
In our last try we said F**k it lets just rush main track and forget about about the side tracks. 
That way we could beat the game and we destroyed the ring at Mordor. But the victory felt kinda cheap.

Ring destroyed: 1
Foes defeated: 5 

The only problem i got with this game is that you can't controll it, if you draw bad events all the time you gonna loose. And theres nothing you can do about it. Can be very frustrated. But strangely enough i do enjoy this game..

I like the way that you are forced to cooperate. However, the difficulty of the four scenarios ramps to such an extent that you can waltz through the first two and yet the Mordor board can just come down to pure luck (Compare say drawing 3 event tiles in a row at Moria to at Mordor). Also, it isn't that evocative of its theme and each player is a little too tied to the rest of the group's will.

I've played LotR LCG more than 50 times since 2011 July.  I made my own prototyping version with high resolution images covering almost most of the expansions.  Basically, I was so eager to buy it when Siu Mui was in stock in late 2011.  However, I gave up and threw away part of my prototyping version (actually, some of them were turned to another games prototyping). Frankly speaking, the mechanism of FFG LCG version card games are very similar.  FFG used the same formula to put the theme into the game.  The creativity of the FFG LCG is not any earth shaking design.  But the quality and the graphics of the game may give you some eye catching bonus.  If you have no or little experience about FFG LCG, the LotR LCG can give you a good choice.  It is also good to try no matter you play it with your playmates or play it in solitaire mode.  

The scenarios of LotR LCG are quite difficult/ challenge. The game may give you some frustrations.  Remembering that I was so crazy that making  9 copies of Gandalfs in order to get rid of some scenarios.  I felt so annoying if I'd to order the cards individually or ordered the 2nd copies of the games in order to get my own custom piles of deck building cards.  For buying this game, my feeling was something like my nose was being picked by the FFG.  Again, I feel the game is not very creative and the game cannot capture the theme very well. 

On the other hand, I like the  LotR (Reiner Knizia) version.  This game was introduced by my friend and we'd played 2 weeks ago.  I've overlooked this game before.  After watching the play through video, I'd ordered the FFG Sliver Line Edition from the Book Depositary with HK$240.  I've played 3 times solo and 2 times with my wife.  The games simulates the theme and the story very well.  For example, the ring bearer can put on the ring and becomes invisible, the ring bearer also has higher risk of being seek by Sauron.  I cannot say this game has a very high replayability but I can say the game has a very good thematic simulation.  Although the strategic is not very deep, the level of rules balancing and its simplicity of game flow are very elegant.  You may ask yourself what is a good game?  For me, a good game something like reading a story book.  If the story book or a board game can give you a wide scope of imagination and bring you to the world of it ..then it is a good board game!  That's why, LotR  (Reiner Knizia) is a very good game for me! 

Recently I've made the expansion of the game - Friend and Foes.  I've just tried it in solitaire mode today.  Pretty good as well.  Unfortunately, FFG will not publish Friend and Foes expansion for the Silver Line Edition, otherwise, the Friends and Foes is also in my "must buy" list!

This game is suitable for light solo gamers and family players who love the story of LotR.
Just my 2 cents!

We've play this with 2, and it was the first cooperative game we tried.  There's alot of planning, and resources need to be managed very carefully (both individually and as a team) based on what the group is likely to encounter ahead.  We've had this one quite awhile now and it doesn't get replayed because we can't remember how, but we do remember that it had a long rulebook.  We need to give this another try sometime.

Unique, well themed, fun, agonizing, long, some what tideous and original game. I like playing this game with the kids even if some of them find the idea of working together wrong. It does teach them how working together to reach a goal is important and is therefore a very good game to have if you have kids. That being said, this is not my type of game and such the rating. It is a good game and a must for families but I am rating it a 6 because I do not care to play it any other time.

Overall Score 6, Appearence 9, Components 8, The Box (storage) 8, Rulebook 6, Ease of Play 7, Mechanics 6, Involvment 9, Replayability 7, Uniqueness 8, Luck 8 v Strategy 2 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)

Great cooperative game!  The gameplay is unique and exciting.  The boards themselves are absolutely beautiful.  True, the replay value isn't through the roof, but it's quite an experience.  I like playing with both this set in isolation, and with both expansions.  I wouldn't say, though, that either set is a "must", they just change the game and give it new life.

Pros: Thematic despite its mechanical abstractions. Beautiful artwork. You will feel like you're progressing through the books.

The first few games really came with a gloriously atmospheric feeling of struggling against the odds and floundering towards the end.

Unplayed since as this took most of the gloss off it. Shame.

RATING: 5
A strange cooperative solitaire game, yet worthy for fans of the LotR story as it captures the feel of the books quite well. I admit, the mechanics of this could have been fitted to any number of different themes, but the job that was done on it was so thorough, from the art to the items, that it ends up being very evocative. The cooperative aspect which makes this game very hit or miss for most people certainly worked with my group, but perhaps too well, there was little tension on the part of anyone to stay in the game, everyone was completely focused on the group, which makes the game much easier. The first game we lost horribly due to playing several rules wrong, the second we won with flying colours, and beyond that I have had no real desire to play the game again. I originally bought Friends & Foes to ramp up the difficulty and add variety to the game, but the game ultimately ended up languishing on the shelf. It's not bad per se, but no one was requesting it, and I certainly wasn't enthusiastic enough about it to bring it to the table again. I don't know if the cooperative play ultimately works for me as a mechanic, as I kept having the niggling feeling that we weren't playing a game so much as trying to crack a puzzle...I just like the constant back and forth of interactive, competitive games I s'pose. Sold.

RATING: 10
(Revision 3- March 2007)This is now the third time I've rewritten my comment on Knizia's LOTR- back in 2001 I thought this was an amazing design and was pretty sure it was a classic for the ages.  By 2004, after playing several times in 2-3 player sessions with crappy groups and folks that never really cottoned to the cooperative aspect my opinion on it waned, particularly as I started to realize that there was a sharp disconnect between the level of theme present in the game as a whole and the actual actions taken as part of the process of playing the game.  In short, I felt (and still feel) that there is a not entirely congruous joining of a theme/narrative rich metagame and presentation with a minimalist, abstracted cardplay/board movement system that never really felt like LOTR to me.  Here we are in 2007, and just a couple of weeks ago I said in my interview with Steve Weeks that I didn't like the game and didn't get how it was regarded as so thematic.  With the release of BATTLEFIELDS, I decided to give the game another shot and I was pleased to see that my initial awe of the design returned.  LOTR is truly a masterpiece of game design, whether you like the cooperative and abstracted elements or not.  There is a HUGE degree of thematic specificity in terms both broad and subtle that really transcends the simpler on-the-board mechanics.  It's not about moving the stupid cone forward.  It's about a lot of concepts that work as mechanics between players rather than between the players and the system- working together to plan for inevitable disasters, waiting for the slower team members to catch up, solving problems as a team, sacrifice, and standing together at the brink of annihilation.  Things like that are definitely part of the LOTR theme, and they are definitely in this game.  I think it's interesting that this division between the specific and the abstract is illustrated in the artwork as well- the life tokens for example are pretty generic, but the John Howe artwork is fantasy art at its absolute best.  So an about-face?  Pretty much.  My criticisms are still valid, but as a piece of game design and as a fairly avant-garde gaming experience, there's little doubt that LOTR is a classic game that will almost certainly stand the test of time.

I used to think that this game was horrendously difficult when I played it, but then I realised that was because we were playing against the Sauron master in one of the expansions. It honestly doesn't look that bad, though of course I may have screwed up with the rules at some point. When I played this 3 years after my first game, I realised that I had made a mistake in our first game which made the game much, much easier, but surprisingly our second game (where we corrected said mistake) was a breeze. Maybe we had an incredibly effective training montage between the two sessions?

I now own this having picked up a used copy up for 3(!) pounds.

I was hesitant to get this, but my husband really wanted it, so we got it.  We beat it once with 5 players and we pulled out some of the event tiles to beat it with just the two of us once.  We have only 'won' those two times though.

Rule Screw Ups: when we played Lord of the Rings for the first time we played any two cards as the rule that we had to play one gray card and one white card was missed. Another missed rule was that we started the white markers on the symbol circle instead of the first space. We just caught on to that mistake... no wonder we were having such a hard time beating it!

I am still really enjoying this game a lot. I had to change my rating because this game is simply better than others that I feel deserve an 8. Its intensity is amazing and really adds to the atmosphere.  Especially since it is a rare game that is cooperative. I have troubles figuring out why the expansions get better ratings, when they only tweak what is already a quality game. Hehe, it seems that I am especially favourable to LOTR games, but it is mostly coincidence. My weak spot is for fantasy and medieval games in general.

RATING: 5
Lord of the Rings is, to my knowledge, the first cooperative title. It took a very long time for this central idea to catch root in the gaming industry; probably because of the very strong coupling between subject (the story of Tolkien) to the mechanics (cooperation). Nowadays we have Pandemic, Ghost Stories, and quite a few others, but that didn't use to be the case. 

As in all cooperative games, you play together against the game, in this case to destroy the One Ring before Sauron corrupts all the Hobbits of the (changed) Fellowship. You work your way through 4 scenarios, each highlighting a section of the story. You are attacked from all sides, and will have to discard many valuable items and resources to survive. You will also have to make choices because you can't do everything. All in all the story is very accurately followed, leading to a strong sense of actually playing it yourself. Unfortunately the resource management pushes back some of the magic: you're not playing the Aragorn-card, but a card with two jokers on it. But it's not a big deal. What is a big deal is the fact that the randomisation of the event chips can screw you over bigtime. If you are unlucky, you hit Bad News upon Bad News, ending the game before you have had an opportunity to build up some defense. The game can be over on the second board, but equally well on the fourth, and this variation beyond the players' control diminishes the fun. This is a well-known problem of coops, and none of them truly solves the issue to satisfaction (although Pandemic comes close). Still, this game is an interesting title to play once every while.

[b]Update[/b] With the passing of the Fell... hrm, excuse me... waning interest in the LotR-franchise this game, including its dark shadow of untimely drawn event chips, never got played anymore. I was able to sell both it and its two expansions off in one sale. Others will find the journey more interesting.

I don't like the base game as much as the F&F expansion (I also have the Sauron expansion, but I haven't had a chance to play that).  I don't mind coop games, but in this case what is the point?  To destroy the ring?  I just don't feel the theme in this game.  Not that I don't like to play for the challenge, but it is not as fun as F&F

A deeply thematic game from Knizia, the master of mathematical abstracts? Inconceivable but true! And it preceded the boom of cooperative games by several years...

The rulebook is somewhat wordy, but the gameplay is straightforward while still abundant with meaningful decisions. Execution of the theme is exemplary, and the graphics are stunning. Absolutely precious...

I've always liked players vs. the game systems, and LOTR is quite an interesting one.  It's also a good solitaire game (assuming you make a few modifications to the game).  If you liked older cooperative "you against game" type projects (when I was a kid, I always loved Fighting Fantasy books) LOTR should be for you.  It's not something you'd want to play regularly, but every now and then (or when you're alone and desperate for a quest) it'll make a healthy challenge.  Very nice experience.

This is the first modern boardgame I bought way back when, so, even though there has been a gap of 15 years, this is where it all started. It may not be the best game in my collection but I think of this as a Classic. I hear it inspired Matt Leacock's Pandemic - nice.

The game that introduced me to real board games. Love the cooperative concept, but it rarely gets played anymore. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best cooperative board game I have played so far. Unlike Elder Sign, there's a real chance of losing this game. That makes victory all the sweeter if you do succeed. 

The expansions allow for lots of variety, with either a battle against the armies of Mordor, hiding from the Black Riders, or controlling the full Fellowship in the major battles of Middle Earth.

Really a form of group solitaire - but it&#039;s an enjoyable ride, especially if you&#039;re at all familiar with the books.  All for one,  and one for all.  (Oh yeah,  that&#039;s a different book....)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A solid cooperative game where the team's fortunes rise and fall continually.  I felt that some of the mechanics were a bit awkward to understand/explain, but it did have a fast pace and stayed exciting to the end.  May have too much of a luck element for some players' taste.

I bought this years ago when it first came out. First co-op game I ever played. After nearly 20 years this is leaving my collection. The design is dated. Too random either you have the cards or you don’t. Either you get a good die roll or you don’t. 

I have too many other games I would rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Well balanced and very satisfying to play: but it is more abstract than I'd like for a game based on such a strong theme. What are the 'life tokens' meant to represent, for example? It also seems odd that it doesn't include rules for solo play. Any game in which players cooperate rather thatn compete seem like prime candidates for solo rules-- an opportunity missed, I think. But these are essentially minor flaws that don't bother me in the flow of play.

The game really seems to capture the sweep of the entire book in a hand management card game.

RATING: 8
After playing this one again with 4 players with the F&F expansion, I bumped this up to 8.  It is such a work of art and way more theme-intensive than any other Knizia game I've seen.  The expansions are great; I'm just now appreciating what F&F adds to it.  Downsides are replayability, which the expansions help with, and the fact that it's difficult to introduce to non-gamers, especially those that aren't LotR fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I don't play this nearly as often anymore, but that's mostly because I've played it a lot, and it does start to feel same-y after enough times through. 

(I think I could mitigate (b) by cranking up the difficulty, but many of the folks at my usual game nights haven't played it that much, which would mean either quick death or me giving more advice than I'd like in order to keep us alive, neither of which makes for a fun time. The expansion also adds variety, but also increases play time.)

Production: Perfect production quality, with one of the best box inserts I've seen, that not only has a place for everything, but accommodates the expansions as well.  Play: I have only played on the easiest setting, yet have still found it to be a fun, tense challenge; and the fact that we're all in it together only heightens the tension, as we feel some evil force is circling the room, trying to engineer our destruction.  It has become a tradition to play it around Christmas time, and I leave the session so exhausted that a year passes before I am hankering for it again.  (3+0+5) (10 plays)

I like this game a lot. It does give me the feeling of the movie as I play it. The quarrels you have, and people you befriend as you continue along your quest. GREAT solo game, though probably not as much fun with more than two players. BTW, I've only ever played it solo.

While naturally relatively linear, there are different things to react to.

Also, I have the expansions and they push my rating from 7 to 8. Thank you, Reiner.

One of my favorite games ever. It takes a long time to play, so my fellow "hobbits" and I play it each year on my birthday. We love the excitement of thinking we are about to perish at almost every turn, and working together to try to beat the game. The artwork is fitting for the Tolkien stories, and the game does a good job of incorporating the events and characters. This game requires clever teamwork. I love it!

I love playing this game, because I mentally envision the plot progressing as in the books and movies.

The gameplay is simple, but the decision-making can be really, really tough.  Sometimes the Hobbits will cruise to Mt. Doom before casually throwing the One Ring into the lava, while other times will see the munchkins being nearly destroyed before ever leaving Bree.

A great co-op game that is even fun when played solo.

Excellent implementation of the Lord of the Rings into a fairly non-complex, but fun game.  Players work together using a group of hobbits to send the ring to Mount Doom.  Card mechanic accomplishes this.  Some random elements, but also requires tactics and of course, cooperation!

For an abstract game that is emulating the entire Lord of the Rings story, it is shockingly thematic and engaging.  Plays relatively fast and the rules are pretty easy to grasp, although I do have some questions on the wording with some of the Legendary cards.

I must say I'm getting addicted! The trying to make it thru dam fun trying!

With names like Tolkien and Knizia attached to this game, you'd think there's no way it could go wrong. And yet somehow it finds a way. I've heard it was one of the first co-ops, so I forgive it for feeling a bit 'basic'. But it's uninteresting and even strange at some times (First spot on our adventure just lets us draw cards? Why? Why not just draw those cards during setup and make the first spot an adventure?). Not really much going on here. Move spaces, draw cards, use those cards to escape and move on to the next adventure, repeat, etc. I think this game rates higher than it should because of the names involved. Tolkien, Knizia, Fantasy Flight. If the exact same game was 'Waterworld' by Steve Jackson, I don't think it'd be rated so well. ;)

Everytime I play, LotR is a fun, engaging, and intense experience (with Friends and Foes).  In fact, I'd love to rate this higher save one problem: set up and maintenance.  After the game I'm exhausted.  Lots of set up, lots of fiddling during the game.  Since I'm the rules/turn overlord, I'm constantly keeping people/pieces/rules on track.  So much work, sadly, activation energy keeps this off the table.

The first times I played this game, I was very turned off due to the luck factor.  If a player pulls event tile after event tile, there is nothing that can really be done...and things get bad very quickly.  But I always liked the game a lot when you were constantly balancing what you needed to do now...while planning for the next event that will come up.  I still hate the "luck" aspect on the last board where pulling events can make you lose with very little you can do about it...but I now find the game very fun throughout...so it balances out somewhat.  I also like the expansions and Friends and Foes sometimes makes it easier to win...without having to survive the events on the Mordor board.  All in all a good game that I enjoy playing now.

Unusual in that all players are co-operating and share their bonuses around to achieve the common goal of destroying the ring.  It can take players who are used to the more common competitive games to get into the swing of this.

Yes there is luck, but there is considerable strategy in finding the best ways to overcome and guard against "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" (in this case 3 events in a row), and there is much fun in finding escapes from apparent game ending events by scraping together enough shields to buy/play one last Gandalf card that just lets you complete the current scenario board. My only reservation is that although the Middle-Earth theme is there the game still feels a little abstract.

Is improved by the Friends and Foes expansion. The new LCG is coming close to a replacement for this for me as it includes many of the same elements - as well as the theme.

This is the game my friends and I have deemed "Frodo Must Die".  We say this because, in every game, the ring gets tossed back to Sam turn 1 and anytime a hobbit has to move forward, it's Frodo.

We like to think that he's running to Sauron with open arms as a child might it's father it hasn't seen in years.

If you're a fan of the whole LOTR thing, then this is a truly gripping ride - the whole package is so well realised and carefully fine-tuned.  
The co-operative element ideally suits the subject matter and the first time your group dunks that ring into the volcano, you'll feel immense satisfaction. After you've done that a few more times, there's several expansions to add further interest.
Non-fans, or those who dislike co-op games, may simply scratch their heads and wonder what all the fuss was about. Poor things.

Cooperate with other players (hobbits) and destroy the ring.  Novel concept..dah dah!  Fun game to play with wife.  Seems to be a bit more difficult to win with just 2 players.

RATING: 10
Players are all cooperating as hobbits in the fellowship and the mission is to destroy the One Ring. The players must navigate their way across the activity tracks of four scenario boards to reach Mount Doom. Boards are exited by completing the main activity track (good), or letting the game events take over (bad!). Movement and events are handled by giving up precious resources - cards, shields and life tokens. All the way through the game there is a ticking clock in the form of the corruption track - with Sauron at one end and the hobbits down the other. As the game progresses, Sauron and the hobbits advance towards each other and if they meet, well, it's not good! An amazing, groundbreaking game that unfortunately some will loathe. Very tunable too - play competitively, even with a corrupt hobbit victory conditions!  I thoroughly enjoy playing solitaire with two hobbits against the game engine.  

2011 Update - I have played the recent Silver Line smaller edition from Fantasy Flight.  It's good, nice, compact and portable.  However, it's been "Fantasy Flighted", which means a a step backwards graphically, with a overwrought rulebook.  The icons are too indistinct, especially on the event track - you really have to squint to see the text properly.  The brown/grey cards are hard to tell apart too.  There appear to be some rules changes and/or oversights - Lembas now allows discards before drawing, and you get the full complement of Rivendell/Lothlorien cards in a two player game.  Good to see it back in a portable form, but get the original for the better components (and save your eyesight).

Still, amazing game that has seen many clones since it was published.  Lost count of the number of average cooperative "make progress, do evil" games that have come down the road since this appeared in 2000.

A great co-op game. Sophisticated enough for my teens, and a real challenge. A blast even after you become very familiar with what to expect. In fact it is more fun the more you play it. The number ranking for the path is great for seeing if you can beat your own best effort.

RATING: 6
Here is a design that I have a lot of respect for. Game play is a bit fiddly at first, but repeated play smooths it out. LotR has quite a "push your luck" factor, as you always want more cards and life tokens than you have, but that tile stack just gets shorter and shorter...
 
Release of recent co-op games like Shadows over Camelot have made this feel extraneous.

I only got this recently although it's one of the first games I found via BGG (must have been fall 2006) that interested me. A lot of fun if played with the right people or solo, which ultimately is the same (PS: Seems like a lot of people got it with the LotR hype and all, unaware that it is a tough game that needs to be learned. So you can almost always find it for cheap $$ on the German eBay!)(The Life Tokens look like they were drawn in rehab)

There's nothing else like this game.  I'm a fan of many of Knizia's games, but this one is special.  Somehow it's very abstract and highly thematic at the same time.  It's all about economizing of resources while under relentless time pressure.  There also aren't many cooperative games to choose from, but that style of play works very well here.  It only gets better with the expansions, and with Sauron you can mix it up head to head.  While the basic progression of the game is similar every time, circumstances continually create new challenges.  This game has been an amazing and memorable experience every time so far.

This game has virtually no replay value, as the major obstacles are known and fixed, and do not change from game to game. Playing the game is like running through a shopping list at the grocery store... you pass from aisle to aisle in sequence, knowing that you need to get "this item" on aisle 1, "that item" on aisle 2, and so forth.

The notion to create a cooperative multiplayer game was a noble one, but the result is just plain boring after you've played it once or twice.

Did not expect to like this, as I generally dislike co-ops, and this one is quite abstract as well...   but the oversize boards, copious Howe art, numerous and flavorful events, and ever-present tension made the game a winner.   It's surprising how thematic the game felt, but the events flow like a story and everything was just lifted by the artwork (apart from the kind of silly life tokens and shields).   Would gladly play this one some more.

I understand the argument that deep down this game conveys the themes (the real themes, not theme as in setting) of The Lord of the Rings books. And yes, it does do that. And yes, it does that well. BUT (you knew there's a "but") getting people to see that, to reach that point it becomes clinical in a way. I don't play games to deeply analyze, I like stupid games that I can have fun with friends over. So despite it being a good game, a well designed game and pretty ahead of its time, I just don't find the game enjoyable.

This game is pretty good for a few reasons - its cooperative, it has a lot of tension, it has great theming, and it scales very well. Probably some people with disagree with this - but in a lot of ways it reminds me of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer game (or is that the other way around). Players need to work together to win - my only problem with LOTR is that their is less reason to squable or ignore advice than in Buffy... but that is mainly because of differences in the cooperative mechanism. BTW - only a 9 to leave room for the expansions to be 10's!

Great cooperative game.  There really isnt much room for players to play individually and you dont really feel like an individual character when playing, but it works really well as a randomized multi-player cooperative puzzle/game with fun group discussion, interaction, decisions, and comraderie in overcoming obstacles.  The game is really well designed to encourage cooperation and social interaction, e.g., a player absolutely needs to consult with everyone so that the game boards can be completed, and you usually need other players' cards to finish an objective, so everyone feels like they can contribute.  

The game should not be played, however, with over-analytical players or players who do not enjoy the theme. You definitely do not want to play with people who dislike working with others or don't like accepting suggestions. And it's more fun if everyone has about the same experience level with the game.  It might overall be a little too abstract, in usual Knizia fashion: everything is reduced down to tokens and symbols. But the game does evoke some theme via pictures and event labels, and also evokes a sense of a quest/journey, a very effective sense of dread when drawing tiles from the bag, and accomplishment when Sauron is beaten.

First game I ever played where you have to work as a team against the game itself.  Rewards careful planning and team play, with enough of a random element to ensure that even the best laid plans of Hobbits and Men can go awry.  Simple mechanisms hide the multitude of choices in a race against time to get the Ring to Mount Doom before corruption overcomes the Ring Bearer, very fraut but always worth just one more try...

RATING: 9
The concept of the Lord of the Rings is very interesting using Co-operative Play. The players have to work together as a team to survive during the game. Each player is a hobbit. You win and fail as a team. How you manage your cards in hand is important.

Lord of the Rings is quite unique compared to other games. There isn't a lot of interesting Co-operative play board games in the market. This is the reason why I bought Lord of the Rings in the first place. To have something different in my game collection. Lord of the Rings isn't like any other games I own.

Expansions are worth taken a look.

Great!  A classic that is probably Knizia's best design.  Phenomenal art by John Howe elevates the experience and really cinches down the theme.  Forcing you to choose the least bad option, and then forcing you to apply it to yourself or to the group mirrors the overall themes of LotR surprisingly well.  Every time I play this my appreciation of it goes up.

I've gotta admit, I've only seen the movies and I play this game with some fairly big fans of the books.  Which reminds me, these LOTR games really need to come with a pronounciation key.  I got a look of absolute horror from my team mate when I mispronounced the bad guy's name.  Whoops.

To me, this game was just so-so.  I didn't like what I felt like were 'cheats' in the game: pitch x and skip this scenario, or use the over powered wizard guy cards to just blow through otherwise impossible scenarios.
It just doesn't seem properly balanced; parts were either too easy or too hard.  Oh, and if you're playing with my husband, chances are someone is going to die in the group.  That's just how we roll.

Initially, I really enjoyed this game, but after about a dozen plays it completely wore out its welcome.  This is really just another Knizia abstract with a theme pasted on - the game mechanics have nothing to do with the LOTR story.

I prefer games with more visceral impact and well... fun.

RATING: 5
UPDATE: As so many more co-op games come out, I have a tough time suggesting this one. It’s pretty foundational in gaming history, but I can’t see suggesting this one over something like one of the many flavors of Pandemic.

UPDATE: There are so many new co-op games out now that build on what Lord of the Rings originally did and does it better. I'm starting to feel like I have more interesting choices in a game like Pandemic or Ghost Stories than in LotR.

This is a hard game for me to rate or to even explain why I like it.

On one level, I understand what all the detractors say -- this takes a great theme and makes it into what sounds like a dry Knizia offering ("What are we doing? Managing a hand of cards?").

HOWEVER, I really feel the tension in this game. Whenever we play, I really have a great time -- maybe it's the art, maybe it's the story, I don't know -- all I know is that usually I feel like we've been put through the ringer and if we lose right away, we usually reset and go at it all over again.

Whether you love it or hate it (and there seems to be no middle ground on this one), you have to admit that Knizia made a very unique game -- a game where everyone is fighting against the game itself and it is very fun because of it.

A big plus for the art.
A big minus for the terrible rulebook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a cooperative game that takes place over a number of different boards.  For a Knizia game the theme suits the game very well.  While I've managed to beat it a few times now, I will say that unlucky tile draws can completely hose any chance of victory which is a shame, but randomness can hose you in any co-op.  I also feel the game is more prone to feeling stale and hope that the expansions can help alleviate this issue.

This game totally captures the tense and gripping excitment of the Fellowship's journey to Mordor. Every game is different and just because you won one time one way doesn't mean the next game will be the same. The variables in the game are enough that you feel challenged every game and you'd want to play it again and again. But the game design is such that the variables are not completely random and that the players have the opportunity to manage them. Brilliant game design by Knizia! I've played the game so many times - I've definitely got my money back and more on this investment!

One of the first cooperative games, and a rather good one, which scales fantastically with the number of players (something rarely seen in coop games).As anything that Knizia has done, it's an insta-classic. The theme is present everywhere in the game, and you will always feel rushed by the forces of evil; the difficulty level is spot on.
As all coop games, players that have trouble getting listened to, or players that won't accept any other conclusion than theirs, will ruin the game. But if you've never tried a coop game, this is a solid choice.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A pure cooperative with an irresistible theme, but the gameplay surprisingly fails to engage me. It manages to create an atmosphere of tension and doom earlier on than other co-ops, but something about it just doesn't hit the spot. Probably deserves more plays.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] I maintain that it probably deserves more plays. It probably won't be getting them from me, though. I much prefer [GAMEID=30549] for pure-cooperative action.

Positives are a strong theme, excellent resource management and wonderful artwork. The game is challenging and effective in encouraging co-operation.

I find that the game has the potential to become arduous. The journey to Mordor constantly drains your resources and puts all players in danger of corruption. If the players don't keep perspective, it can start to feel like work.

Strongly consider adding this game to your co-operative games collection.

Playing it was a real fun experience, it was the first time we played any collaborative game. Since we both enjoy single-player it was no hard transition.
We did some wild planning together about what the best next action was and who would voluntarily suffer the proposed damage, so that the other could help in any other way.. intersting experience.

A huge thank you to Danny Mack for this gift!

Edition owned: 2nd Hasbro edition (2001) (see differences [thread=904507]here[/thread]).

Best Tolkien themed family board game, is cooperative.  (Compare with: Shadows Over Camelot.)  2-5 players, 90 min, complexity 2/5.  Very good game for gamers, and works well even with two players.  Can be very tense.  Comparison with Shadows Over Camelot: SoC is more accessible/casual/fun/social especially with the traitor element, stronger theme, higher production quality, individual contributions are more important, lighter, less linear than LotR, needs more players, more but simpler decisions (eg I'm at the Grail quest so I play a Grail card); LotR is more gamey (less psychology and more strategic/puzzle-like because you have more resources and more complex decisions), more replay value, more cooperative and less individual play, playable with only two players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
This is one of the few cooperative games I truly enjoy.  You always feel like there are decisions to be made and the discussions come together very organically.  Normally, I check out when it's not my turn in co-ops, but I was always engaged.. however, we played with only two players so my wait was minimal.  I could see this scaling up well to 4 players though, as the events and happenings are always very relevant to all players and Gandalf/special cards can be used by anyone at anytime for the good of the Fellowship.

This is one of the best abstract tolkienesque games on the market. And even if it doesn't look like much at first glance, the game has much to offer for those who dare venture forth on this quest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This abstract and weird-looking game is actually a very solid cooperative game that does a great job at replicating the feel of the books.  There's a real feeling of tension as hobbits are slowly (or quickly!) corrupted by Sauron.  Making it to the end feels like a real accomplishment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Finally, a cooperative game that is actually fun to play.  One can see the genius of Knizia throughout this game as you work together to eek out a victory -- or not.  The theme works beautifully and the game length is just right.  I really enjoy this game and look forward to trying out the expansions.

The first Euro I ever owned - if I'm not mistaken, my parents gave it to me in 2001 or 2002. It's also a fantastic game, though, so the rating isn't purely sentimental.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have to rate this higher than Pandemic because it offers much better choices.  For a Knizia game, this actually delivered on the theme.  I'm sure the terrific artwork helped my imagination get going as well. This game shines with cooperation. You need to plan together, work together, and sacrifice together in order to get through some really tough spots.  If the point of a coop is to "enforce" teamwork to win, then this game succeeds tremendously. 

Each board is a scenario within the game with a different emphasis and there are choices and consequences for getting through something quickly or not.  Each player has a special power that they use to collect different types of resources that will need to be discarded to help avoid events (which are frighteningly bad) or help exit the scenario board. At the same time, there's a corruption track whereby Sauron and the hobbits move towards each other. If one of the hobbits moves onto the same space as Sauron, game over man!

For my money, I much prefer this coop over the other two old school coops, Pandemic and Ghost Stories, and after having played this not till after both of those, I'm not sure I get why people went gaga for those two when this design offers more interesting choices and variation. The hand of cards you have offers more individual decisions than the other two. From my experience, I would've guessed the order was Ghost Stories > Pandemic > LOTR. 

Of the more modern cooperative games, I prefer the way newer designs give players more individual decision points in the form of cards. The cards of Pandemic and LOTR are simple compared to what players manage in Gears of War and LOTR:TCG, and I prefer those two as my current favorite coops.

RATING: 7
This game continues to be really f'ing hard. And that just adds to the appeal, to be honest. I want to play it partly just because I want to beat the damn thing. 
Not to say it isn't also fun, though, because it is! I think the game mechanics, abstract as they are, actually blend really well with the theme - especially for a Knizia! The whole idea of self-sacrifice, and putting the quest above all else, is obviously central to LotR.

That being said, though, this game really falls into the co-op pitfall of one or two people playing the game for the rest of the group, especially if there's a disparity in experience amongst the group. So that's a bit of a downer.


Update: Finally beat it, and honestly it was anti-climactic. Nobody even died! Strange as it seems, I think I prefer this game when we lose. Must be time to mix in the expansions, to ensure inevitable defeat.

Es entretenido, cooperativo y tal, además las ilustraciones de los tableros son una pasada, pero no se por qué tiene algo que no me termina de gustar. Creo que es el marcador de eventos, eso de que siempre en todas las partidas sepas qué va a ocurrir exactamente y qué es lo que tienes que hacer (la única incertidumbre es no saber exactamente cuando). Aún así me gusta, aunque prefiero otros.

-----

It's fun, cooperative and with awesome illustrations (I’m talking about the 2011 Spanish Edition), but it has something that dislikes me… I don’t know exactly what. I think it is the activity track, you always know what will happen and what to do (the uncertainty is when it will happen). However, I like the game, but I prefer others. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For me not many co-ops have done anything different to this apart from remove depth. I love the fact that players are to balance selfishness with sacrifice and the latter is totally expected by everyone but one (the person who has the ring and needs to finally destroy it). Kinizia's games always have some deeper strategy tucked away in there as well. It's very hard though, can only be finished if lucky but as said before the players have to decide when to sacrifice their lives for the good of the team to spare turns/resources and the timing of this caan be a good boost. Your group may be cursed by fools though who do not want to die, failing to step outside the narrow box of their puny mind (?) after more plays, I realise that you can solve the game to a degree, hence the need to advance the difficulty level - so it's apparently not as hard as I thought.

This is a nice little co-operative game whos difficulty is relative to the players. 

If players are accepting that only the ring bearer matters and they are expendable then it is possible to win the game.
If players are more attached to their characters the game becomes extremely difficult and almost impossible to win. 

This makes for very interesting games.

Cooperative games are nifty, and this one is pretty durn fun, if you have geeky players who like to collaborate.  Without any expansions, though, the game after a while sort of devolved into "were we lucky in Moria or not?" with the rest of the game's success feeling like it depended mainly on the answer to that question.  Nonetheless, as we gained experience, we were able to try a harder game (against a tower that's already advanced), which has become essentially unthinkable in playing the expansions.

[b](Rating is much higher when played with an expansion.)[/b]

[b]Lord of the Rings co-op that - when played with a group of people that know each other - seems to play bigger and better than the sum of it's somewhat antiquated mechanics. After more than a decade of enjoyment, I'm finally ready to trade this.[/b]

PROS
- Gorgeous art
- Mostly easy to teach/play
- Socially more interesting than the mechanics would seem to show
- Two boards of pressure (Corruption track and Activity board) are my kind of thing
- short duration
CONS
- Some finicky rules that are easy to miss (who gets the ring; ringbearer gets more cards; etc.)
- co-ops have come a long way: this feels a bit clunky now (but expansions improve it considerably)

Played 20+ times. Played with whole range of players and enjoyed all. Even people who don't know the books usually enjoy the game due to the social & co-operative nature. Fans of the book ought to really appreciate this game. Unique and intriguing. I recommend it. Best when adding in new players. Great social game. Lots of variants to spice things up a bit too. The best thing to do is get the Friends & Foes expansion which makes this game really shine by adding difficulty and tension. And for the ultimate tension addition, get the Sauron expansion, where one player now takes the role of he who shall not be named. [o]

Our gaming group has more or less "solved" this game. When we have 3-4 players, we can usually win it without breaking a sweat. My wife and I still occasionally enjoy it as a 2-player game, which is difficult no matter what. Even if you know exactly what needs to be done, getting the right combination of cards and tile draws is tough. We've never won the 2-player game, but have come close twice.

None of this has diminished our love for the game, though, which is the best game purchase we've made since Carcassonne.  The tension and the need for real cooperation make it a classic.  

My reasoning for dropping my rating two whole points: I pretty much only want to play the base game now when it's just me and my wife, or when we're introducing new players. With 3-4 experienced players, I like to add [thing=2449]Friends & Foes[/thing] (which remains a solid 10), and hope to give the other expansions a fair shot soon.

This is the ultimate 'journey' game to me.  By the time you crack open all the scenario boards and pay for each step of progress with painful discards you really feel as though you've been on a long adventure across many lands.  This game is an epic boardgame.  It's not easy to jump right into and I consider the rules complex, mostly due to the way they're written.  Lots of words with bits of info buried inside long paragraphs.  It made the game hard to learn for me.  Still, I enjoy it with the Friends and Foes expansion and consider it a 'one of a kind' must have for my collection.  The game is long, dark, ambitious and beautiful.  Whenever I play it I notice what a great value it is with all the separate boards and the loads of fantastic artwork. Great cards and bits as well.  I enjoy it two player and it scales very well.

Note... This was the first boardgame I'd bought in at least ten years and I picked it up due to the theme.  I was looking for something simple to play with the kids and was disappointed in it's complexity.  The kids watched in horror as the hobbits died one at a time.  I had no idea who this Knizia guy was and what a Eurogame was.  Boy did I learn.

This is kind of the grandfather of all coop games (I know it's not the first one, but it's the first one I played and I'd like to think that this is the game that made people realize that coop games can actually work and therefore started the recent trend of coop games). I have played it a lot during the years and when I played it quite recently with the Sauron expansion I was amazed at how well this game stood up against many of the newer additions to the genre.

I love the story arc in this game with the tension slowly building up the closer you get to Mordor. Many coop games are purely tactical (and therefore can be perceived as more hectic almost from the first turn), whereas LOTR has strategic elements that reward long-term planning. If you only play with the current turn in mind and don't look ahead, you will most surely lose the game in the end. During the first half of the game you get spammed with resources, and when you leave Lorien you usually have so many cards that you think you'd never run out of them, until you realize you will hardly get ANY more cards during the other half of the game. Therefore every cardplay is kind of agonizing and almost gives you a bad conscience: ("I really should haved saved this card for Mordor!")

I also like the fact that there are at least two different valid overall strategies to each board, and you really have to discuss those strategies with the other players. Of course this game can suffer from the infamous "alpha player syndrom", but I think that has more to do with the people you play with than with the game itself.

RATING: 7.5
When I first read the rules it looked like this was just gonna be a luckfest. Flip over tiles, draw cards, hope you get the right cards to combat the tiles, roll the die...but, there's a lot more to it. Not suprising though since this is a Knizia game. The cooperative nature of the game is very unique and makes this game a lot of fun. Trying to work out a plan with the other players while still trying to keep yourself alive can be difficult. The game gets very tense when Sauron and the Hobbits get close to each other on the corruption line. While I can understand why some people don't like this game, I was pleasantly surprised. 

I had this rated higher, but I'm dropping it to a 7.5. Playing Pandemic has actually made me like LotR less. I don't dislike it at all (it's still a 7.5), but Pandemic is just so much more streamlined, and plays so much quicker.

There's enough Lord of the Rings flavour here to make it a good game to play with those who know the books, but it would seem pretty empty without that familiarity with the theme.
There are some interesting decisions, the boards are lovely, and the gameplay good enough. I like playing it as a solo game too, but I have a nagging doubt at this stage that it's all too easy to whizz through the boards, ignoring all but the main storyline track on each board.

RATING: 6
This is a really good game, but you have to really learn the mechanics before it becomes fun.  Don't get discouraged after the first few plays - give it some time.  When playing with just two, you play with less cards available to the players, and it can be more fun to give yourself a break and start Sauron at 15.

Update: I traded it away after not playing it for so long. The rules are a little overly complicated for what the game is, IMHO. Furthermore, I now have Pandemic, which provides a much better co-op experience.

The best cooperative game that I have ever played. You actually feel like you're in Middle Earth, on the quest to destroy the one ring. Everything works as it should. Yes, you can get screwed by pulling unfavorable tiles, but the chances of doing so are not enough to skew the game after repeated plays. I always enjoy playing this one - better have at least four players, though, as the more there are, the less difficult it is to defeat the One Who Shall Remain Nameless.

Played first game the other night (2 player), and only made it a short distance into Shelob's Lair. We were going swimmingly well until I drew 5 event tiles in a row from the bag and we were quickly overcome by the big S.Very enjoyable for a first game! I imagine it can only get better with more players. The challenge is tough, so can't wait for the next play!

Played a couple more 2 player games, both times overcome by darkness in Shelob's Lair, damnit!!

 I was not enamored at first with this game. As I thought the lack luster design of the card and the game elements (aside from the figures/Sauron) were very abstract and served to remove me from the thematic play.  But the game is solid. Interesting and worth a try.

I played this the first time with a couple of Lord of the Rings (the movie) enthusiasts, and the movie soundtrack playing in the background. It was great: the game radiated the atmosphere of the movies and was enjoyed by all. In the end we won, but it was a very tight victory. The next time I played, we just walked into Mordor and tossed the ring into the volcano for a boring victory. The time after that, the board conspired against us and we were killed off in Moria, for a boring defeat. The main problem of this game is that the high amount of randomness might turn the game into a boring experience, or (by chance) a good one. As a coop, it has been surpassed by many other games.

It's a well thought out mechanic that forces you along the same path as the books fairly well, but it is also very mechanical and hard to determine if the players have much control over what happens. Decision making seems minor and not extremly impactful to the game. 

I really want to win this game, but I think that once I do that, I will have had my fill of it.

How can someone take such a beutiful theme and ignore it that much???
Its the Lord of the Rings..  I has been books,films, comics,songs,everythings.How can a boardgame ignore all that world and give a game of such poor connection with its theme! IT'S THERE.JUST USE IT!!!!
As about the game its Knizia all over it.. (Take a card,give a card,take another card if you can play this one more card...) It could themed in anything,for example Decathlon(oh,wait!...)
And its cooperative of course,although you may not notice it from the start.. It MAY be noticed in some events where all the team decides on what cards to discard...
It's just a great excuse for non-gamers NOT to play boardgames... A bad game and from a well-known designer..Just a pity

Cooperative game controlling the hobbits as they attempt to destroy the ring before corruption takes over or Sauron captures them.  Somewhat abstracted, but thematic at the same time, especially in the corruption track.   Requires the players to work together and make sacrifices to get the ring-bearer to Mount Doom to finish the mission.

This one hits the ultimate sweet spot for me. You manage a hand of cards while moving game pieces on two boards---the one for the stage you're on, and the master progress board. It plays in 1.5 to 2 hours. It's purely cooperative (though one expansion isn't). The art is phenomenal. It's my favorite game.

This game is a lot of fun, recreating the drama of the original story quite successfully.  Once you've got a few games under your belt it's uncommon to lose, but a run of bad luck can lead Sauron right to your party.  More members in the party means it's easier.  This changes with expansions... I haven't done so well playing with Friends and Foes and Sauron... they're tougher, in my opinion.

An exceptional Knizia in that he takes a rich theme and distills it to its core elements.  I think it works even though it is a bit dry and abstract.  It is challenging and I think that it has marvelous tension.  I have only played it solo so far and it works great in that respect.

I have a true passion for Tolkien's works, so this was a must have for me. It is a cooperative game, where players goes through Frodo's travel from the Shire to Mount Doom, retracing all his steps, always struggling not to be reached by Sauron. I think anyway that this game should be approached only by "motivated" players.

Finally got to play this one--it's a masterpiece.  Yes, I'm a biased Tolkien nut, but this joins War of the Ring as my only other 10.  Hits all the right LOTR nerves, but in a totally different way.

It helps that we have the perfect group for this, so your mileage may vary.  However, after one game they are clamoring for more, and I even still have two expansions to add when they tire of the initial game!

Knizia...who'da thunk he'd have made a good game?

What a fun game! You and your friends really have to come together to defeat the game.  It feels like an adventure.  I look foward to adding the Friends and Foes expansions. I've played about 8 times with the base game so far, and it's still challenging.

RATING: 7.425
Fear was that this would be three player solitaire - but the game works with a group of fantasy tragics as the theme does apply quite well.  Also can be happily played solo, which in a strange way will diminish it being brought out on a games night (30/5/09). UPDATE: Still interested in this game, just not playing it, so still rated a 7 - best played after watching the movies! (24/12/11) UPDATE Time to return to one of the earliset and most thematic co-ops (Rating 7.425, Jan 17)

RATING: 8
Lord of the Rings is a super-designed co-op that has more to do with player decision-making than complex gameplay.  While I find the game a bit no-frills, its focus is not supposed to be particularly in-depth; it is a game meant to bring gamers (who are normally opponents) together to defeat Sauron (a classic enemy!).  Thematically it works, if you understand the source material. This can be a very dry experience for those who are not interested in the source material or not a fan of the somewhat abstract gameplay.  But for me I find everything comes together nicely and creates a solid, balanced experience of pitting four (or five) brave Hobbits against the forces of Mordor.

RATING: 6
Clever system that set an early standard for multi-player cooperatives (but has since been overshadowed by subsequent offerings) but not my cup of tea.  To me, it felt repetative and mechanistic after only 3 plays - but I end up feeling that way about all the Cooperative games I have tried.  Apparently, I prefer games in which you are working against live opponents.  

This is an "experience the theme" game... If you value that in a game experience, you will think more highly of this game than I do.  UPDATE: I bought this for a friend's young child (8) for Christmas, so he could "play a big game with Daddy & Uncle Pierce" - we had a fantastic time..  Since then, I've played it a few more times and have concluded that my initial impressions were about right: If your group is into the theme and with the right group then it can be a really fun game, otherwise... it falls flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game mechanism is great and somehow manages to get you into the spirit of the story. The cooperative mode, however, did not really strike the right tune... Also, as in all games where you try to beat a system, an inherently wild randomness factor must be present for it to put up a decent fight against humans, which as far as I am concerned offers negligible gameplay value when compared to real human opponents. 

We are planning to get the Sauron expansion, however, which may bring about a drastic change in my rating.

Fascinatingly original idea. You play cooperatively (each player as one of the Hobbits and there HAVE TO BE sacrifices) and I think I&#039;ve never seen another game that captured the underlying spirit of the source material so perfectly! Rather complex, but you play cooperatively so one experienced player in the group is usually enough.

RATING: 7
[b][i]Lord of the Rings[/i][/b] is still one of my favorite cooperative games. The game requires you to properly assess your threat and constantly manage risks versus rewards; missteps are severely punished. This game is difficult, as are all good co-op games.

The game follows the story in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, consequently you're fighting through the same story each game. This could mean that repeated plays end up feeling very similar. Fortunately, the extreme difficulty means that you're constantly trying to improve your game. Also, the random tile draw leads to large variances in ideal strategy which leads to surprisingly dissimilar games.

I'm usually not a huge fan of abstract games, but this one has beautiful artwork and enough theme to keep me coming back for more.  I particularly like the cooperative element as this goes over well in my family.  If playing 2-player, make sure you find the errata pertaining to Rivendell and Lothlorien card distribution (you now get all the cards).  Seems easier to win with 4 or 5 hobbits.  Worth a good play, solo or cooperative, in conjunction to watching the movies.

Its an okay game, I brought it with all the expansions together and have played with them altogether from day one.  Its not bad with a group of LoTR nerds, the cooperative factor means we retain the friendliness in the room, even when someone is playing Sauron.  Solo, its not a bad game to play once in awhile.  For once (unlike the author's other games) this one fews thematic and it is a tough nut to crack.  I have ever beat the system once.  Not something I want to play over and over again, but its great once in awhile.  Good game for the collection.

RATING: 6.5
The unique selling point of this game is, of course, that it is a cooperative rather than competitive experience. Players work together to overcome the events and challenges thrown up by the game mechanism. When we first got this game we played and played, trying to do better each time, and some of the magic wore off. We knew what events were likely to crop up and what we needed to do or collect to overcome them. So it became a bit mechanical. Now I'd be happy to play it again, and it is especially attractive to Lord of the Rings fans.

At first I was offput by the way the game uses its board. The players don't progress through a location in a physical sense. Rather the boards represent a conceptual approach to collecting the various resources that are needed by the players. But after playing the game a few times, I started to like the conceptual approach. It works well.

Very good game.  I find the cooperative play rather refreshing, but I prefer keeping kibitzing to a minimum.  This keeps the game tense and less of an exercise in groupthink.  Lowish rating only because it's not something I'd likely want to play twice in one week.

Knizia's classic cooperative game.  Very nice production values in a game where you try and make your way to Mount Doom.  Every once in a while, it's nice to pull out a game where everyone actually works together.

This game has been out a while and still holds up. There's something about it that appeals to me and it could be how well I think it captures the theme. 

I know there is a newer edition now, but the components are cheaper in quality and while the new tokens are nice, you are missing the minis and the amazing Sauron figure. Plus the old edition works with Friends & Foes which I would never play without.

It's really hard for me to rate this game. LOTR is quite different in that it's a co-operative game, which in essence makes it very similar to a multi-player solitaire game. However, it highly succeeds in creating an atomsphere that draws you into the game. Maybe it was because I has watched LOTR the night before, but it really drew me in (and I do not like solitaire games at all). Perhaps the Sauron expansion will help me enjoy the game even more, by creating a human opponent. Anyways, my rating of 7 is a comparison to all other games where the main opponent is not a human, but the game mechanic itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I would want to play just the base game in order to rate this game. The only time I played this, I felt that one of the players tried to force his will on the rest. I guess that is one of the possible problems with cooperative games. But if the players are allowed to play more freely, this might be a fun game.

Still one of favorite co-op games. Was one of the first of that kind and paved the way for many more to come. Play it still after 10 years with my 10 and 12 year old sons. They love it as well. Good mechanic, great graphics. It feels "Lord of the ring"!

Lord of the Rings is enjoyable for two players who are looking for a cooperative experience that is not too simple and not too complex. The turn structure is straightforward, but each turn offers meaningful decisions that can have far-reaching effects. Luck is a heavy factor, but we feel that we still have a chance to win even when luck runs against us. Housekeeping at the end of turns and conflicts is not too burdensome for us. The quality of components in the Silver Line edition are just fine for the price we paid for the game, and the artwork is lovely and evocative. We are happy to keep this game in our collection.

I like Lord of the Rings, but I have to wonder whether there's just too much chance involved in the outcome. We've played twice now and lost both times. We made it to the last board the first time, but were crushed in Shelob's lair the second time after just barely surviving Helm's Deep. Most of the strategy of the game comes down to managing your hand. Play your cards well, and you have a chance of surviving. Still, I expect it will frustrate some.

Great to play with friends. A good balance of luck and strategy with great artwork. The combination of luck and personal decisions make it a good game. As a Lord of the Rings fan the game becomes so great in light of the system, that while abstract, incorporates the themes of determination, fellowship and hope. Tolkien would be proud.

Lord of the Rings is a tremendously innovative game, and a good one, but it loses some of its spark after the first few plays.  The Friends and Foes expansion completes the game and elevates it to greatness.  The Sauron expansion, for me, did more harm than good. The Battlefields expansion is very weird and abstract, but also very interesting for experienced players.

One of the original cooperative games, this is a tough-to-win game that uses lots of shared information between players.

I like the fact that it is very hard to win. The expansions change the game around in different ways. I need more plays of them to determine if I really think they add to the game experience or just add time/complexity.

This game doesn't get much gameplay anymore with Pandemic and BSG filling that coop player spot. Shadows over Camelot doesn't hit the table much either with BSG out. BSG is just awesome.

My first co-op game ever, plus my favorite theme, plus Knizia - definitely a winner! However, others took more convincing and the length was a bit much for some.

Didn't want to play this as I find the whole LOTR franchise dull and, well, geeky, but I was hooked.  Truly co-operative game that builds tension well and demands sacrifice to win.

This is a fun game and I enjoy playing it, but its mainly due to the theme. It took me several attempts before I was able to destroy the one ring and beat the game, but I had fun each time while doing so. Have a great day and take care.

Let's start off by saying that I love cooperative games and being a LOTR fan, this ranks fairly high for me. Best, perhaps, is the utter fear and dread that this evil, evil game can impart onto it's players - perfect. However, the interaction between players isn't enough for me and I personally find the game too difficult to win (not play).

The art of this game is just striking.

I would have bought this game had I known that my group would play it.

The game in itself feels a little simple, even if I'm sure with the advanced version (we played the basic one), we would have certainly lost. 

UPDATE
I played again this evening with girlfriend and we had a blast. Not sure about a lot of rules, but we'll see. Hope to play again!

UPDATE

Played again this evening. Fast paced and quickly over in around half an hour, still remaining meaty and non-filler like. We beat the game, so I'm confident we can try with the expert difficulty next time.

Played with friends who were also completely new to the game. Very fun game with interesting mechanics that always kept the game tense, which is what needs to happen for a cooperative game. By the end, two members of our fellowship had died and the other player was willing to chance a sacrifice to Sauron to make sure I delivered the ring in the end. Lots of hard decisions in this game, especially since nothing is guaranteed to go well. Looking forward to playing it again.

Got this off ebay, tried it out, and the co-operative nature of the game really turned me off. Why bother having hands of cards when you just communicate what you all have at the moment. Really dull which is a pity as other LOTR games are great (e.g. Confrontation, War Of The RIng)

What an intense game!  I actually play this vanilla with my children.  Generally speaking, when we're playing games, I have to ask "What cards are you holding?".  In this game, that's actually how the game is played.  Very tense, but when you get the Ring into Mount Doom, it is a serious rush.

Rules wise, I thought the game was just so-so, actually almost bland.  But I must admit there is a high level of tension as you drive to complete a quest.  When one of the other players are struggling, there's usually a pitched frenzy to see how everyone can help save them.

I'm really torn on whether or not I should like this more or if it's a bad game because of it's simplistic gameplay.

I have to be in the mood to play this one. I want to love it, but it hasn't really grabbed me, possibly because everything happened backwards. Instead of suffering a series of defeats on the path to eventual victory, by some freak of luck we got three wins in a row, one on each difficulty level, followed by the expected series of defeats. The sense of struggling against insurmountable odds just isn't there.

Hopefully it will come as we play more in future, and this will ignite our interest.

Played this again for the first time in years. It really gives a good feel of the books. Contrary to some, I have no problem with the random elements and love the rpg elements. But it still burns my stomach when we draw four sundials in a row... When you beat this game, try it with the Friends & Foes expansion for a much harder game.

My brother found a copy of this in good condition at a charity shop for £4 and picked it up for me. Previously I had picked up the Kosmos edition of this game for £10 at a game auction. 

This is a lot of fun, really immerses you in the LOTR universe and sets your pulse racing when Sauron starts to get just a little too close for comfort on the corruption line.

One of the best "players vs game" board games I've played ( it's ONLY cooperative, no competitive game). It is quite simplistic though, and doesn't have as much re-play value since you all follow a specific story. But it's quite a good introduction to people who are not used to other boardgames than Risk and Monopoly.

Fun to play once every now and then though. And can be really difficult if you want to. If you want a purely cooperative game in your collection, that's not too advanced then I recommend this.

Tried this with 4 friends. Our first session was brutal, although Sauron started at 15, the ringbearer got killed in Kankra's lair. The game is a nice change of pace, cooperative against the game. I'm thinking about buying it.

Borrowed it from a friend and played it three times. The rules are really weird, so we didn't quite get what to do our first time. We immediately went again and it was much better, especially since we had some foresight. Got mauled in Mordor, and tried again the next day for a close and very satisfying victory. Great cooperative game.

Very evocative of the books, even if in a somewhat abstract level. Luck is significant, especially in event tile draws, but it affects all players equally (besides, they win or lose together, anyway). It's funny to fight your way to defeat the game system, and it works differently but surprisingly well with any number of players. My only concern is about replayability after you win a few times, but then you have the expansions.

Juego tematico cooperativo en el que se lleva al grupo de "la comunidad del anillo" (solo los 4 hobbits) y el objetivo es completar el tablero llegando al monte del destino con el anillo. 

La premisa es buena, y el juego viene con el aval de haber sido desarrollado por el ilustre Dr. Knizia... pero no logra el objetivo. 

La mecanica de juego es floja, la tematica no transmite, los materiales no ayudan... muy flojo. Lo mas flojo que he probado, que yo recuerde. 

Algo bueno que se puede decir de el es que es barato (ya que casi todo el que lo tiene trata de deshacerse de el a toda costa) y que es sencillo de reglas. (de reglas, ganar la partida es otro percal). 

le pongo el 4.

Works surprisingly well, considering how overly simple and straightforward the gameplay is. Feels more like an experience than a game, but given the theme, I think it is intentional design choice.

The theme fits this one so well and there are few other games with so much tension. It really is pretty thrilling watching the tiles flip one by one and seeing how bad things are going to get for you. It actually maintains a nice thematic feel which is pretty rare for a Knizia game. Granted, the differences between fighting and hiding aren’t really present mechanically, but it works because it’s such a birds-eye view of the story. The "working together" aspect is great for playing with new players (as long as you can keep yourself from making decisions for them) and also allows you to play by yourself if you want. This game just feels so streamlined and balanced. Very re-playable, scales beautifully, great components, unique mechanics. You have to respect this game as one of the forerunners of the co-op game movement that has become so popular lately. Especially for fans of the source material, this one can still be fun, but it lacks a lot of the “figuring out the puzzle” that its predecessors have. Given that, that randomness can be a big factor, and most of the decisions involve risk/reward calculations about what type of cards to play first.

I have got the Friends and Foe expansion but, if anything this actually made it easier to win as the fellowship through military victory of all things!

The pleasure one get of this game depends heavily on the game group.
With some the game simply refuses to work at all and with others, it really shines.
Sometimes the bad luck is so overwhelming that the only thing to do is to bow to Sauron.

edit: changed the score to 10
This is simply the most thematic game of my whole collection.
I've played the game with various groups of people, and the thing that amazes is that, when people start bickering, the games goes downwards, as if that plastic ring (which could have been so much better) was actually having the power to corrupt.... how awesome is that?  
When people talk of integration with theme, they usually mean a simulation of real-life actions by game systems - here the game thematically reproduces the moods, the feelings and the type of choices the protagonists of the Lord of the Rings live through.  The game also strikes a perfect balance between luck and planning.
This game is the pinacle of thematic integration in games; true it requires some effort, just like good books, but unlike books you can play Lords of the Rings again and again and again, and find it all the more perfect.

RATING: 7.8
Great co-op that looks a bit dated by today's standards but has really good game play.  Forces everyone to be team players and negates "bossy" players that are typical in co-op games.  Tough to beat as well.

RATING: 5.5
A good coop game, with a lot of theme.  Adding the Friends & Foes expansion makes the game somewhat more difficult.  We've tried the Sauron expansion as well, with six players, and found the game too difficult to play.  We'll have to try it again though.

While this was the first Euro-style cooperative game (it isn't the first cooperative game, if you consider the Family Pastimes cooperative games in which cooperation is the goal, as well as the lesson of the game -- in which the game is not always a challenge), it still holds up really well today -- so much that it is still my favorite cooperative game. This game in some ways resists the alpha player mode that occasionally occurs with other cooperative games (i.e., Pandemic) through sheer unpredictability (while, of course, being balanced by someone with a PhD in mathematics). While a bit of reading ahead in terms of events aids in identifying 'easier' routes, that does not mean that they are simple. Either way, there is enough stuff to keep track of (especially if you add in expansions) that players are almost required to keep track of differing areas of the board (and here an alpha becomes a welcomed coordinating captain, a la Space Alert). While the game is incredibly abstracted, the tension and the art evoke an increasingly (long) difficult journey to mount Doom in Mordor.

I thought the cooperative thing would appeal to me. It doesn't. If I die, it doesn't seem like a win to me, even if the other hobbits win. It's a longish game with bickering and player elimination. No thanks.

This is a different kind of game for sure. It plays well and I really enjoyed it much more the second time I played (Had it figured out much better then). This is fun in that it is rare that there are ever shared goals in a game. Plus it seems that often someone will have to sacrifice themselves to save the others and that is very much in keeping with the spirit of the books.

[Initial Impression: 7]
This is a very well-themed and compelling cooperative game, making it an excellent choice for LotR fans and for less competitive groups.  The game is quite hard  to complete, which is a big plus for replayability (although it can be made easier by starting Sauron on a higher number), and there are a number of tense decisions to be made on each quest.  You'll be high-fiving each other when the ringbearer reaches Mount Doom after seeing several companions die and then just barely avoids the gaze of Sauron to finally win by the skin of your teeth.  Gameplay can sometimes feel mechanical, and one player who knows the game well can turn it into a multiplayer solitaire by telling others  their "best" option.  In general, it can provide a nice break from the cutthroat games I usually prefer, and is best with a group that can really appreciate and enter into the LotR atmosphere.  Although I generally prefer Shadows over Camelot for a cooperative choice, mainly because of the traitor mechanism and the variety of event cards in that game, I think LotR has an edge for depth of theming and the edge-of-your-seat feeling.

After struggling through the rules, it took us one play to figure out how to play. The second play we destroyed the ring. And then stared at the board for a few minutes, thinking, is this it? Did the game just end? 
This really didn't "click" for me, and it is the only game I ever sold.

Thematically, the game aims to be a condensed version that retells the legendary story of our hobbits, and it does so very well. It encapsulates the story almost perfectly, until you see Aragorn as a card you burn in one turn and, well, he's gone for good. 9/10 for thematics.

The game part of the game works well. It is simple to explain, yet it has depth to it. A low barrier of entry is appreciated, so I believe the game successfully achieves what it sets out to do: A one hour speed run through Minas to Mordor.

What's keeping it from being a 10 is that there's nothing really special to it.

RATING: 5
It's a Knizia, but doesn't feel anything like his other games. This game immerses the players in J.R.R.Tolkien's world, and follows the books/movies faithfully. The game starts out slow, but rather quickly becomes a desperate struggle for survival, let alone trying the destroy the ring. The abstract mechanics are simple, and interesting, as they do not dumb-down the game, but allow the players to make crucial life-or-death choices almost continually. All players are engaged, as each represents one of the five hobbits in the Fellowship, and each has a special power that can be used to break one of the rules. Using all five powers is essential to winning the game, and since resources are extremely limited, players must choose on every turn (not just their turn), to surrender resources (hobbit cards, life tokens, shields) or get corrupted, for the good of the Fellowship. Sauron approaches menacingly from one end of the Corruption Track, while the hobbits start uncorrupted at the other end. The game ends if the ring-bearer hobbit is corrupted to the point it meets Sauron OR the ring-bearer gets to Mt. Doom and destroys the ring. The corruption track is pure genius, as it conveys a sense of urgency, and impending doom. The tension is thick, and the action is fast. The game goes rather quickly at about 90- minutes, and is fun whether the hobbits win or lose. I personally think the game is too simplistic/abstract, but the feelings it generates for all who play it is unmistakable. This is a cooperative game, similar to Shadows Over Camelot, and Arkham Horror. It really depends on what people are familiar with. If they've read LTR or seen the movies, this should be a hit at the table. I will need to get the F&F and/or the Sauron expansion, to see if it can up the complexity for my tastes.

Update (01/20/12): Initial rating was a '7'. It's been a year since the last play, and my disdain for cooperative games has solidified. I'm open to breaking this out and teaching it to some newbie who is an LOTR fan, but have no desire to play it with my current group. I think it is time to start finding this a new home. It's a '5'.

Very good.   Not only did this game pull in my non-gamer wife, it also piqued her interest in LotR in general, getting her into the movies and books!  Plays much better with the tiles in the bag from the Sauron expansion.

This game certainly entertained us. It is lighter than I would have expected. Lord of the Rings is an epic story of legendary characters doing amazing things. This game is about playing the cards that you get while things happen to you. There were decisions to make here and there, but it was mostly just having things happen to you. Not as bad as [thing=31481][/thing] but in the same vein.

Like I said, it was entertaining, but we don't see it coming out much. I'm glad I played it but I think I already had my fill after one play.

Keeping in mind I've only played this once, I found the gameplay only ok. I'm beginning to realize that I don't enjoy when a game presents you with a challenge and a condition and that condition is to show/play a card from your hand to resolve it. Ie, show this symbol. That is way too vague an explanation, I know, but this game has a lot of that and I think that's why I didn't enjoy it.

One of the best, most unique games of all time. Play cooperatively as a Hobbit, trying to reach Mt. Doom and destroy the Ring, while encountering all sorts of obstacles along the way. Tolkien's masterful work plays out in front of you as the forces of darkness close in around you. Beautiful John Howe artwork adorns the boards and cards further enhancing the experience. For those who must compete, there is provision for scoring to determine a winner should the Fellowship succeed in destroying the Ring. A must for Tolkien fans, and anyone who loves great games!

Reviews say sometimes the luck of the draw makes victory too easy or hard.  Played one solo tryout and got destroyed with many 3 corruption die roles, and one 3 player where (with some considerable event tile luck) we blitzed Mordor with Sauron and Hobbits only moving 2 corruption each max and a score of 87 - seems to bear the reviews out.  Hopefully over time we'll get less extreme results.  I think the co-op/competitive option would add considerable bite, as well as being more true to life, but it's early days on this one.  Fun to play a co-op game for a change, and nice production standards and theme.

I really, really dislike LotR as a franchise. Books were too dry and I didn't relate to the characters in either the books or films - I simply couldn't care less.

But the game? The game made me feel every. Single. Step. On the most treacherous journey to destroy the One Ring. I've NEVER played a game that made me feel emotionally WRECKED to lose and so incredibly elated to win (at least the first time). I don't think this has great replay value because of its scripted structure but it's challenging enough to pay for itself after a few plays, IMHO, before passing it onto the next lucky co-op fan.

Although I'm very much a fan of both the book and the films, I find that this, like so much else from this designer, is just a very abstract game of symbol manipulation. It's a tough puzzle, but the experience seems completely sterile to me, I don't feel as though I'm in the story or even that I care whether the players succeed or not. Pandemic has a much better connection between theme and mechanism, is more emotive and plays quicker. A shame that Hasbro's marketing clout meant that this was available in toy shops while much more accessible games like Settlers remain the province of specialist retailers.

[b]ONE GAME TO RULE THEM ALL, ONE GAME TO FIND THEM; ONE GAME TO BRING THEM ALL AND AT THE TABLE SEAT THEM DOWN TILL WE WIN THIS DAMN THING[/b]

This is the oldest game I own. While I learned how to play games with my sister’s Monopoly copy  twelve years ago, I learned about [i]board gaming[/i] after I got this game for Christmas in 2000. After a few years of not actually being able to play this game since many pieces of it were lost, I finally found replacements when I subscribed in BGG. Since then, this game has seen all the action it didn’t see in over five years. And just like it was when I started playing it, is is still one of the hardest and most daring games I have ever seen.

In this game, the players take the roles of Hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Marry and Fatty Bolger, added to this game just so it could be played with 5 players), each with his own special ability and miniature of matching color. The game consists of a series of scenarios, where players gather strength, spend cards and face the adversities of Moria, Helm’s Deep and other holiday spots of the like. The game ends (If possible, I might add) when the ring is destroyed in the depths of Mount Doom.

The game turn, though hard and filled with dangers for the players (If not, for the active player at least) is a very simple step of the game. And so are the various steps and phases within the game. The rules are very simple and not much questioning is involved during game play, except for the obvious exceptions regarding events and cards being played.

As a Knizia game, The Lord of the Rings comes as a fresh breath of air from all the abstractness of his previous releases and projects (Not that I’m complaining about them…) and lack of a real permanent, needed theme for a game. Unlike the other games of Herr Reiner, TLOTR has a lot more of game depth developed for the sole purpose of making this game a particular choice within his vast collection of designs. It does not behave or play out abstractly and the theme is very well mix and put together around the game mechanics and art, and viceversa (John Howe really topped himself with this game’s artwork).

The level of difficulty on this game is astounding, and incredibly as it may seem, the people I’ve taught how to play this can’t get enough of it, not mattering if they win, lose or draw (It’s just a manner of speech, you can’t draw in this game, and if you do, you’ve lost). I think that happens because the game itself is not only a real challenge and a source of infinite strategy, but also because people don’t like games being smarter than them or better than them in any way. TLOTR therefore has become a sort of competition within my regular gaming group. I don’t think it will ever not be.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Themed: As mentioned above, this is the one Knizia Game that relies heavily on the theme, and I don’t see the mechanics of this game being used properly or to the full extent as they are in this game, on another one.  Though the basic ideas of the turn flow and phases  are common place for many games, TLOTR actually puts them all together in such a way that trying to overlook or ignore them is not far from impossible. No wonder the ways players have to “prevent” certain things from happening are found in the game elements themselves.
 
Simple [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Complex: As with games with so much bits and symbols, the game may be seen as complex by outsiders and they wouldn’t be wrong if they tried the game. The complexity of it relies on the heavy amount of symbols a player has to know every time and how they appear and act on the game itself. However, the game play itself is not too complex, except for the fact that a lot of decision making must be made before each turn.

Strategic [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Tactical: Long-term strategies don’t work well in this game, because of the high risk element involved in each “draw” step of the turn. Event tiles can change everything or the can change very little, so tactics are a better choice. However, minor strategic action plan may be proposed at the beginning of the game, as for certain cards the players use and when would the precise moment would be to use them. 
 
Luck [b]_[COLOR=#FF0000][2][/COLOR]________[/b] Skill: Considering the fact that in almost 12 years of me owning this game, I have only won with other players around 8 times. It’s safe to say that luck plays a major part in this game. If you leave too much to chance and don’t prepare yourself, you might end up dead sooner than expected.

Fiddly [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Elegant: The rule book is not very well written, and it lacks a better flow of explanations and examples. Though the rule book itself is a bit flawed and unclear, once the game has been played a few times with the rule book open, it could eventually see less and less light, since the only things important enough to ask about the rules are usually known by other players.
 
Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: Despite the fact that dying alone in this game is possible and very probable, team-work is almost always a force behind the players actions. Trying to stay alive as a group won’t work unless everyone’s ready to sacrifice everything to destroy the Ring, no matter who’s the Ring-bearer in that moment. And still, survival of everyone in the game is not guaranteed. 

Cutthroat [b]__________[/b] Friendly: Playing solo, trying to be a hero, thinking glory is for the strong and not for the group will most definitely land you harsh treatment and maybe, even the scorn of the other players. It is a co-op game, so thinking co-operatively is important, at least in the sense of considering the other player’s decisions before doing something risky..

Heavy use of language [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] No language needed: The whole game relies heavily on symbols and combinations of symbols, so there’s not much language involved In the game, except for the event track on the side of each scenario and the little text-boxes on the main board. Those are usually simple to understand and as usual, some of the players will know what happens in each one of them.

A connundrum: good mechanics marred by the cooperative play.  My personality type does not merge well with more agressive players making the game painful to sit though - it's like watching someone play chess by themself.  Feels like a complete and utter waste of time.

Take this with a grain of salt

1 Play, played with all the expansions and another player playing Sauron, never got out of Bree.  Way too much going on for a first play, although every one else was much more experienced.  I am sure this is a better game than I rated and I will give it more of a chance.  Seemed overwhelming for a new player, may want to play the base set to get a better idea.

It has aged a little, but still a great coop fun. Typical card playing to move game. Posiblemente el primer juego que le dio gran visibilidad a los juegos cooperativos. La idea es revivir la aventura de la hermandad en su viaje por expulsar al Anillo de este mundo definitivamente. La estrategia consiste en cuándo utilizar las cartas y las habilidades de los personajes. Sauron es muy agresivo y te puede destruir en cualquier momento. Los jugadores deben superar las tareas de cada tablero calculando que el Ojo no se mueva demasiado porque si alcanza a la hermandad todos mueren.

RATING: 7
First played May 30th, 2008. Taught in 20min, played in 1hr with 3 players. This is a competitive co-opretive quest mission game. To win, you must throw the ring into the fire, otherwise you lose. Each player is given a starting hand of cards which you must use wisely. You go on mini adventures (Moria, Helms Deep, Shelobs Lair, Mordor) using these cards and are not easily replenished. Froto is the start player and bears the ring to start. On your turn you play cards to capture shields and 1 of each of three life points(ring, heart, and sun). For each life points you don't capture during each quest you lose one life point and move toward Sauron on the life track. All hobbits (Froto, Sam, Pippin, Merry, and ??) start on zero and Sauron starts on 12. First you turn over tiles which may have events that do(or play cards to skip), or have an icon of one of the sub-quests(move that sub-quest token forward). Keep drawing tiles until you get a non-event tile. Next you play two cards, each hobbit has a special ability(Pippin can play any two cards; Froto can play white cards as wild; etc). Collect the icon on the track that you move to and through. The Ring Bearer can place the ring on and pass over spaces without effect. Once you reach the end of the main quest path, you get a blind shield(values 1-3). 5 Sheilds can enlist a spell from Gandoff once for each of the 6 spells. There are many times when you must roll the die. Sides are blank(best), 1,2,3pix (which you move your hobbit closer to Sauron), 2 cards(lose two), and Sauron eye(move Sauron closer to each of you). If you can't fufil any request that player is out of the game and if it's the ring bearer, everyone loses.

Languishing on the shelf since Christmas 2010. No plays yet. :(

Update: 26.5.12
Finally! Great game in there somewhere. We've just got to figure out how to play it. Got slaughtered in our first outing, but looks like we were playing the game correctly, just not optimally. Looking forward to round two. Hope it's not in another year.

Update 19.1.13
Got another play in finally, albeit solo. Enjoyed it immensely even though Frodo ran into the arms of Sauron at the end. Luckily Sam was carrying the ring and kept his wits about him. Hoping to get my wife interested in playing it soon.

Best semi-cooperative game ever IF you can get used to the choices between boards.  Some people get really lost in the transitions between boards. My favorite game ever!

I bought it quite cheaply with the enemies expansion. We played two times so far and except for the old looking icons on markers and cards this game feels quite fresh. We enjoyed our plays so far and we're looking to push up the difficulty on our next run.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finally played this one right and it got a ton easier (although, I'm not terribly sure that's a good thing).  For anyone struggling to stay alive at 12, remember the ring bearer draws two cards at the beginning of every scenario board and that event tiles with three icons mean one OR the other, not both.

Even though a normal game is a little over/under an hour, the journey still seems epic and grueling like it should and so I must commend the game for that.  Man, the tension in Mordor is intense...

Update:  I've played this with some other people who I came to find really disliked it.  I think you have to have a pretty strong tie to the theme to enjoy it given that, in truth, the game is merely a supped up version of Go Fish with events and die rolls.

Oct08: Well, I got to try this one after Pandemic, but I think it still lived up to my expectations.  I enjoyed the theme and even enjoyed the play style.  My wife really enjoyed the personal goals that seem to be missing from the later coops.  In LotR, you have to care some about your own hobbit.  It's true that the group wins if the ring gets dunked, but it's real hard to just let Sauron eat your hobbit if you can help it.

There seem to be plenty of expansions that I don't really need to try.  Maybe if I played the crap out of the base game.  The tile flip of doom definitely does add to the tension.  As does the severe lack of resources.

If you at all are interested in coops or LotR, I'd recommend to give this a go.  It's an enjoyable game that I had a lot of fun with.

Had it for months, finally played it as 2P game.  Wasn't as hard to learn/play as I thought it might be. Flows nicely, I didn't have to run to BGG to have questions answered like other games.  Tense at times, and moves quickly.

 UPDATE 7/08 Played it after it sat on shelves for 2 years. Dunno why.  Played several 3P games, really enjoyed it, and the kids did too.  People who say this game plays you are way off in my book, plenty of decisions to make, nothing is automatic.  Have yet to win, but getting better.  If you win and it is easy, then re-read the rules, you are doing something wrong.  The rules are clear, but you can easily miss or forget something while playing the first few times.

I think Ghost Stories has spoiled me. I feel like LOTR has too much randomness with too little ability to mitigate or work around that randomness, thus it's difficult to come up with a reasonable strategy. Ghost Stories of course has a random element but the whole game is about trying to avoid that random element as much as possible; sadly, it seems unavoidable in LOTR.

RATING: 7
Fun game with a great theme fairly true to story. Some difficult choices and original mechanics with the co-op play make it nice to have also some turns are quite tension filled. That said, it is fairly luck dependant and some things are almost pre-determined re your choices. Balances well, have not yet added F&F to get the full effect.

Update: It really is a little too much like solitaire for my liking and someone else calling this "go fish" isn't really as far off as it sounds. That said, it is still a unique co-op experience in one of the greatest themes ever (IMHO of course) so it stays in my collection for now with an occasional play. The componets and theme definitely help keep the rating where it is.

Update: Down from 7.5 => 7 for reasons above and too many other good games to choose from so not being suggested.

Update: Well well, before playing so many games it seems I dismissed this as mostly luck and a solitaire type game. While this IS true to some degree it is really a brilliant and very unique design overall and I have really come to appreciate it now after some more plays many years later. Lots of planning with timing especially and resources re the cards. It is tense, very thematic, unique and fun which makes it quite enjoyable to play and it scales down to two players which is probably my preferred way to play. Don't dismiss this too soon and trade it like I almost did unless of course you don't enjoy the theme.

The gameplay against the system is unique but leaves me feeling that after a certain number of plays winning is more an issue of tile-draw order and die rolling than player actions. I am far from being there so could well be wrong.  It remains enjoyable for me/us.

I've read all Tolkien's LotR related books when I was a teenager and enjoyed them immensely.

Reasonably challenging coop game.  Although some folks claim it to be very difficult to win, I don't find it so.  As long as you follow certain guidelines like making sure to see what the next Event will be and being prepared for it, it tends to go fairly easily.  You are playing members of the Fellowship of the Ring and you play cards to move the expedition along.  You also have the Ring to help out once per area.  You have to survive through four areas.  Each turn you flip over a tile, which is often bad.  If it is bad, you then have to flip over another tile, which can lead to cascading doom.  There is always a nice tension and sense of imminent doom, recreating the desperate atmosphere of the books.  Each player has a hidden hand of cards and so you have to talk about strategies together, which is good.  Particularly enjoyable if you are an LOTR fan.

Masterpiece!  Probably the only two downsides are 1) Players with enough experience at losing stand a good chance of winning and 2) A single player with enough experience at losing can just tell everyone what to do the whole game through making it basically &quot;single player&quot;.

I love playing this game with friends and family.  The decisions are tense and agonizing.  Not a game I could play everyday but when I do play it this is tons of fun.  I can't understand the criticism that there aren't very many interesting choices.  This game has TONS of choices that are interesting because they all seem like LIFE or DEATH choices.  The choices aren't in where you are going to go just like the novel there was only one place in which they could go to destroy the ring.  The choices are in how are you going to survive the journey there.  There are tons of resources that you have to decide on when to use and when to save.  Which track should you advance on, when should you save your shields.  There are tons of different ways to fend of impending disaster.  I think a lot of the people who don't think there are many choices didn't have the interest to learn all of the interesting tricks you can do to survive the ordeal.  That's what I love about it is that it seems like an ordeal that you have to survive and your choices DO make a difference.  After playing this after a long break I realized why I love this game in the first place.

There are two types of people that plays this game. Thoose that likes it, and thoose that does not. I am among thoose that did not like it. The game is to simple, yet very difficult to complete. There is few ways you can tactically defeat the game. A bad bunch of tiles can render you to dust regardless upon how prepared you are. Still unique enough to be worthy my score.

I enjoy this game. A very different kind of tension than that present in other coop games I've played. (Pandemic, Hanabi, Space Alert) 

Our first two games were losses (though we would have won the second had we started Sauron at 15 - we moved him back and played it out), which is probably for the best. I like the ways that you are forced to work together throughout the game. When we move Sauron back it seemed that the ending might be anticlimactic, but perhaps it would be less so if we had not moved Sauron to continue to the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This coop game does a good job of drawing the players together in their quest to defeat Sauron. The mechanics are quite abstract, but they work for this game. The game is prone to quick disaster if you have a streak of bad luck, though I often feel like I could have gotten through the streak if we had played differently earlier. The only problem (so far) is that the ending can seem a bit anti-climactic, though that may just be the result of how my first two games went.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2011)

One the first games I ever bought and I really REALLY wanted to like it as I’m a huge LOTR fan, also when I bought it I was sure all Knizia games were instant classics. Sadly this game (and other Knizia titles I have played) lead me to a rude awakening. It took me more than a year to play this again…. There is just no interest in me or my game groups. 

I like cooperative games so that’s not why I dislike this game. Somehow I expected a game from Fantasy Flight and Lords of the Rings to be hugely thematic, however when I play this I don´t feel the theme anywhere, it´s more an abstract game. I find the game has a lot of luck in the events tiles, you could be wiped out with the very first event so, for me, the success of the game is determined by the luck of this tiles. Also, it seems there is not a meaningful decision in the game, either you have the needed card or you don’t. Not much more choice than that. The game moves on its own that’s to the (hated) event tiles so I don’t feel I’m playing anything.

On the good side the components and art are very well done, the Sauron piece is solid and feel nice to the touch. Also this is the game that knocked out Knizia as an autobuy designer from me (Relationship Tighrope also helped)

I suspect the game could be better if I find the right crow for this, I will give it one more chance before I get rid of it, but right now I’m very disappointed in the game.

It´s a shame I don’t like this game, but there are a lot of better coop games out there (Arkham Horror and Space Alert come to mind).

RATING: 7
I've gone back and forth on this game and its rating.  In the end, I split the baby.  There are elements that seem genius in the game design and then it slips back into stupidity again and again.  Sometimes you forget the mechanical nature and are striving to finish a board with a limited hand and its brilliant.  Other times, you lose that and just are drawing and discarding card symbols.  In the end, I'm glad I've played it but I don't want to anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After 1.5 plays of 2P...

The rules took me a lot longer to digest than would normally be required for a game of this complexity. As yet I haven't worked out why.

Quality presentation helps this game.

I have the feeling this co-operative game is easier to win the fewer players there are. There are some seemingly obvious things to do that perhaps don't get done by every group (?) like make sure Sam is carrying the ring as much as possible. But being able to set the difficulty simply by starting Sauron one or some steps closer should help this game be very replayable.

Some people like this game. I never quite got what's so good about it. The mechanics are new, however, and while I have nothing against cooperative games, I found the play monotonous and disinteresting, and I highly doubt that anybody who hadn't read the books would enjoy this. Won't be suggesting to play this again, but if everybody else wants to go for it, I'll concur. I don't find this likely though. Try War of the Ring if you're into the theme - the art is as good, and everything else massively better.

RATING: 8
My non-gaming pals have unanimously decided that they really like cooperative games. They have enjoyed Shadows of Camelot a great deal and this one plays very similar to that in my opinion. The difference lies mostly in theme. Lord of the Rings, however, is much harder to beat. At the time of this review we have played 5 or 6 times without a victory thus far but we are getting better. I look forward to trying the expansions to this one.  It is a very simple game to teach.

Very good game if you are looking for more interaction between players and enjoy cooperative games.

Theme goes a long way here.  To those who think that there are no real decisions to be made, I would suggest that they are suffering from a real &quot;group-think&quot; scenario.  The fact that this is multi-player solitaire does not necessarily mean that it is not fun or has no replay value.  It does keep this game from being _great_, however.

RATING: 7
I really love this game, the only reason it didn't get a ten is that it's basically a solitaire game played co-operativelly and one person controls most of the action. Rare is it that the group might need another card and someone refuses to throw it in, what's the point of getting more points than another player if you all don't win? I play with my solataire rules I posted at the site. Sold to Aldi.

Well, at first I didn't get it.  Then I understood it and I don't much care for it. It all comes down to those tiles that push us along the left hand column of "bad things" you must overcome.  You draw a bunch of those in a row and the game is lost, if you get a decent mix, you can win pretty easy.  I like all co-op play, the multiple boards, the corruption of the hobbits is so interesting and sauron moving forward is cool too... but I just don't like how it all comes together as it seems we are trying to beat the system instead of play a game.

Everyone works together to defeat the system.  I can see where the complaints about the "know it all" player syndrome might come from, but if the whole group is at the same level, Lord of the Rings can really shine.

LOTR is an enjoyable cooperative game, mainly for the theme and setting. Mechanics are a little on the fiddly side, and luck is too strong of a factor (e.g., one bad roll can spell defeat for the group in the latter stages), but a fairly solid game. Also, the artwork of the location boards is simply stunning.

First, up this is a beautiful game - the board and cards are excellent and it catches the LOTR theme perfectly. Relatively simple rules and playing WITH your friends makes a nice change from playing against them. I've read someone else criticise the game for relying on primitive AI as your opponent. However, even after a fair number of plays we're still getting a lot of enjoyment and we still found ourselves getting beaten by the game so there is sufficient challenge there.

Hmmm ... not sure what to make of this.  I don't mind the co-operative nature of the game, but the mechanics are frankly dull.  It does generate genuine tension but without the theme strength the tension is unfocussed.  Knizia can do this with a short game but at over an hour you need some more theme to support the mechanics.  I will continue getting my LOTR fix with LOTR:C and WOTR.

RATING: 7
If there's a phrase that inspires terror in my heart, it is "Reiner Knizia's Lord of the Rings." But you know what? This is a solid cooperative game, and it is the closest Herr Doktor comes to a living, breathing theme. It's still like entering the Knizia echo chamber, in which Frodo, Sam, Gandalf and company faintly call out from the clockwork depths of hand-management, resource management (yep) and generic, catch-all story choices. But if you listen, you can hear them.

In 2009, LOTR occupies a good middle ground for pure co-op games: longer than most recent titles, but a good deal shorter than Arkham Horror. The pacing matches Pandemic, but the game runs twice as long, broken up into a handful of tightly packed scenarios: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each scenario thrives off of the same tension: let's get the heck out of here (Giant Spider, run!), or let's strengthen the bonds of the fellowship. Nothing stops the group from blitzing Moria with un-hobbit-like abandon, avoiding all of the plot-crises that may arise. But a power-mad rush plays to the ring, leading the pure of heart deeper into Sauron's corruption.

Play is simple. On your turn you draw a tile from a bag, which may trigger a story-threat to the fellowship. You keep drawing until a harmless tile comes up, and then make your move. There's some ability to play to the odds here, but unlike the controlled epidemic-distribution in Pandemic, nothing prevents drawing every bad tile in a row. I've seen this happen once in five games, and sure enough, we lost that game, though Sam and Pippen were near the summit of Mt. Doom at Sauron's moment of ultimate triumph. The possibility for such total disaster feels a bit out of place, but we certainly got a cliffhanger out of it. The scenarios themselves differ in their priorities, but I worry that the same set of goals will hurt the game's long-term replayability. It seems to me that you're encouraged to take your time (to the extent the tiles allow you) in Moria and Helm's deep, and to rush Shelob's lair and Mordor with all the saved-up ferocity you can muster. At least, that's won it for us 4/5 times. Overall though, this is a must-try for co-op fans, outshining every peer except Pandemic and Space Alert.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a really nice co-op game in which everyone feels like they can contribute. We played with the friends and foes expansion and defeated the foes. Cards are played to progress along either the main path or two side paths for one of several boards. All give mostly good tokens, but sometimes the die has to be rolled which usually brings you and Sauron closer together. There are also escalating challenges for each board, so you need to progress on the main path and get to the next board before being overwhelmed.

Very tight resource management co-op/solo game. The game plays out over several boards depicting the events in the Lord of the Rings. There are several tracks on each board and players must play cards to advance on these tracks collecting resources based on the spaces they land on. At the same time random draws are causing an event track to advance which generally causes bad things to happen.

Players have to balance immediate benefits, long-term goals and collectively optimize to ensure they reach Mt. Doom before the eye of Sauron corrupts them.

Since you progress through the same boards every game I am a bit worried about replay. However for $30 I think I'll definitely get my money's worth. The game easily has 15-20 plays before it gets too repetitive... and at that point there are expansions to consider.

I love this game more and more the more plays I get. I've played this game 7 times this week only.

And I don't agree with that this game is too easy to win, of 8 plays so far we've only won once.

This has seen many plays in my game circle due to the cooperative gameplay.  The story of the book is captured beautifully and it refreshing being able to work together as a team rather than taking one another out.  The game presents some really tense situations which you have to discuss together how to survive and it is also great seeing players sacrifice themselves for the sake of the other players and the ultimate win (hopefully) of dunking the ring.  The game works best when one player isn't dictating what everyone else should do.

The granddaddy of all cooperative games is still worth playing 15 years after its publication.

Ultimately this game is about evening the blows out amongst your team so you can hobble to the end, which is a huge part of the LOTR story. I felt a little insubstantial at times as a hobbit, but it works well for the cooperative nature. However the core mechanic of essentially playing a different suit of card to advance down the action paths is weak. I liked the way it was based on the books, and the characters are (mostly) well utilized.

LotR is probably in Knizia's second tier, which is a pretty damn good place to be. It skillfully and subtly evokes its theme by placing the players on the same sort of journey that the Hobbits endured and giving them similar kinds of choices (highly abstracted of course) about how to complete that journey successfully. My wife proposed to me during this game, making me "put on the ring," so it'll always have a special place in my heart beyond its intrinsic quality.

I have only played it once with my daughter and her friend, I have also played it a handful of tmes solo. Definitely more fun with a group. It's only O.K. as a solo game, I think this is more of a social event with the group trying to work co-operatively to destroy the ring.

RATING: 6
I appreciate the innovative aspect of this game - if you look at the context in which this game was released there was really nothing else like it.  However, at this point in time, with so many different cooperative games around, many of them playing in a shorter amount of time, it doesn't really distinguish itself enough to warrant repeat play.

I should note that it is amazing how thematic the game feels in spite of such abstract game mechanics.  You're just moving pieces down the board, picking up cards and discarding them, but somehow you do feel the tension of getting closer to your destination, but victory slipping through your fingers as you approach.  Knizia is definitely shortchanged when it comes to thematic integration, how he does it is really impressive.

A cooperative game that feels like a heavier version of SoCam. I like the design and the way players have to work together, but the game feels a little static to me. Once players have a grasp on the strategy, they will always play the same way.

I really like this game. I it is great if you like the Lord of the Rings storyline. Art by John Howe is awesome. The game play is fun and lightly thematic. I think the co-op play is really well done with each player feeling reasonably independent but working towards a common goal. I don't think the 'normal' version is all that easy. But, just in case, there is room to make it harder.

Update: five of so plays in, I can see why expansions became so popular. It gets a bit old. Sadly the expansions are now out of print ands super expensive to get.

Gotta love it. I enjoy a good co-op game, and this one is short and sweet, yet there is room for extensive strategy. The multiple, interchangeable board mechanic is really cool, and it helps you get into the game, as if you were actually standing on the edge of Mount Doom. Box-to-box time is an hour or less, so it's long enough to get your daily fix of gaming, but short enough that you could easily play multiple rounds or other games.

Plus it's fun to see who can do the best Gollum impression.

(This set is complete, but it shows some wear, as was bought used and has been well loved.)

Not entirely certain about the edition, as it has both the Fantasy Flight & Sophisticated Games logos on the box but is dated 2000. The box is in very poor condition - previous owner taped it together as best they could, & the red hobbit figure is cracked at the leg (I should be able to glue it, though).All other parts are there & are in good condition, though one name has been written on the Hall of Fame record.

I really wanted to like this game but the amount of rules seriously bogged down the flow of play for 4 players sitting around a table. Granted it was our first play through but I wasn't feeling many opportunities for strategy so much as I felt our Fellowship was just reacting to events. Decent design but it just wasn't for me.

Played it for 3 times already and still haven't managed to win it with our group. The rules seem a bit complicated at first, but are very clear after re-reading them after the first play through. 
I like it, just sometimes you can have REALLY bad luck when covering up the event cards and almost lose the game in one turn, depending on the amount of bad events that get covered up. 
But we still like it and put it on the table three times in a row, still trying to beat it.

Flavorwise this is strong, but I think I should play this again as more like playing instead of a tutorial-sort-of-a-thing to find a real game here. I know there's one and I also think the playing benefits if all players are fans of the theme and skilled enough to make accurate decisions.

A game that captures the theme of Tolkien&#039;s work perfectly, not so much via the mechanics, but through the feel of the gameplay.  You don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re marching to Mordor, but the tension and suspense, the feeling that the quest is hanging by the breadth of a hair, are very real, and very well done.  May have a &quot;best strategy&quot; if you play too much, but for a few plays a year, this isn&#039;t really a factor.  Some text on special cards, but otherwise, very conducive to play by younger players.  Highly recommended!

Rated as a solo game. Remarkably thematic, and succeeds in offering up meaningful interplay between several subsystems that all require the player's attention. Maybe not something you play again and again, but nice to take out when you get the itch.

My third game was a very comfortable victory on normal difficulty, with Sauron six spaces away from my hobbits and a score of 84 shields after spending some on cards I didn't need. I think I got lucky that time, but perhaps when playing alone you should either play two hobbits only or on hard difficulty.

It very much adds to the enjoyment of this classic.

Decent game. Easy to play and LotR universe/theme but outdated design.

The game is not without flaws but is still a good, nasty romp through the setting.
In this game you and your friends will play as Hobbits. You will play cards to advance certain tracks, trying to clear the main track fast enough so you don't faceplant into all kinds of bad events.
Evil will constantly try to corrupt our party while still advancing their plans in general... trying to eat you up!

Based on 15+ plays (25+ plays with expansions).  LotR is great as an alternative to the more cutthroat fare my friends and I usually play, or as a two-player game for a significant other.  It certainly fits a niche in my collection.

RATING: 7.5
One of my favorite co-ops.  For some reason, this one doesn't get the same attention that other co-op style games (Pandemic, BSG, Shadows over Camelot) do, which is too bad as it's one of the best marriages of theme and gameplay in the genre.  Maybe the Knizia factor hurts it, but, really, with or without expansions, this one has brutal tension up to the end.  Yes, the scoring and symbols definitely bear the mark of their creator, but I actually find this system much more tense and interesting than, say, the cards in BSG or Shadows.

Only drawback is that the expansions become necessary in order to avoid staleness.

I wanted to like this.  I wanted really badly.  I'm not a huge fan of the LotR series (I like the Hobbit much more).

The concept is neat, but ultimately I just feel like the game has little to do with me.  No matter what I played, it felt as if the order of the event tiles was already predetermining my fate.  In other words, my choices seemed to have minimal impact on the game as a whole.

One person in our group who doesn't like confrontational games and really loves the LotR series had a great time though, so I imagine we'll be getting this one out again.  Maybe I'll like it if I play it more....

Megpróbáltam átgondolni, hogy mi miatt nem tudtam megszeretni ezt a társast.
Egyrészt a szabálykönyv szerkesztése, megfogalmazása rengeteget rontott a kezdeti lelkesedésemen.
Másrészt úgy érzem, hogy egyszerűen túl nagy a szerencse szerepe a játékban. Már írtam párszor, nincs bajom a játékokat befolyásoló véletlenekkel, de itt egyszerűen alapjaiban határozza meg az egész eredményességet, és ha szerencsétlenül fordítgatjuk az eseménylapokat, akkor aztán a legfantasztikusabb játékkal is esélyes, hogy akár már a második kaland környékén is elkaphat minket Szauron.
Furcsa az is, hogy nem mutathatjuk meg egymásnak a lapokat, de beszélhetünk róluk, amennyit csak akarunk. Tehát elmesélhetem, hogy mi van nálam, de nem mutathatom meg. Ez nekem nem logikus.
A játékidőt 60 perc környékére írják. A második próbálkozásunk során már gyorsan, gördülékenyen mentek a dolgok, de így is több, mint 90 perc kellett ahhoz, hogy meghaljunk. 
De talán a legnagyobb bajom a lineáris játékmenet. Mindig ugyanazon a pontokon kell végigmenni, és tulajdonképpen az újabb játékokban a saját korábbi eredményünkkel tudunk versenyezni. Olyan, mint egy számítógépes játék, aminek van egy pályája, amit teljesíteni kell. Persze ott is lehet állítani nehézségi fokozatot, de nekem attól nem lesz újszerű az élmény. Értem én, hogy ha hűek akarunk lenni az eredeti cselekményhez, akkor ezt így lehet megoldani, és ebből csak annyi a tanulság, hogy az ilyen jellegű társasjátékok nem nekem valók.

Ha egy társaságban előkerülne A Gyűrűk Ura, nem menekülnék sikítva, és persze, leülnék játszani, de az az igazság, hogy magamtól nem venném elő.

Have only played a coupla times with a gamer buddy, but we love it.  We both get tense every game, even the time we kicked butt.

There are so many things to keep track of that it's confusing the first time around (3 different kinds of cards, 4 different kinds of tiles, 5 boards to play on, _the ring_, and much more).  I only hope this game pays off upon learning the flow better.

But for 2 new players trying to teach themselves, it was rough.

Acquired pre-2003. Hasn't seen much recent play. Was played a lot more the couple of years before that, so I estimate > 40 games total. Only problem with this game: it takes a while to teach and go through the rules to newcomers. After that, it's a good, fun, tense, cooperative game (much cleaner and tighter than Shadows over Camelot). The Sauron figure is great!

The first co-op game I played and owned. It is a decent enough gaming experience the first few times played, but as time went on, it began to get scripted and frustrating, especially when we so rarely could get through the Helm's Deep board. 

One time, and one time only, my kids and I managed to destroy the damned ring before Sauron devoured us all. And after that, I had little desire to play again, and neither did my kids. Pandemic had arrive by then, and that game has proved to have much more replay possibilities. I traded LOTR, and haven't regretted it.

Trying to simulate the journey of the Hobbits leads to quite some railroading, but which offers opportunities and necessity to plan ahead. Unfortunately the cooperative nature is somewhat limited. It might have been better if it were possible to exchange cards more often (similar to what Castle Panic does).
The biggest negative factor seem to be the event tiles. On one hand it feels unintuitive to draw tiles until you get a non-event one; on the other hand you can be screwed pretty quickly when you happen to draw event after event.
In its heyday it probably was revolutionary, but nowadays it seems to have been surpassed by most other cooperative games.

This is the only co-op game I own, and being a fan of LOTR I thought it would be more fun, but unfortunately it falls a bit short.  Thematically it is fairly strong and the board art it excellent.  The cards and bits are also of above average quality.  I found that the mechanics connected well to the theme as the hobbits fall deeper into darkness as they approach Mordor.  The game fails to address the fact that the hobbits were separated at the end of Fellowship and it is possible for Pippin, Merry, or even Fatty to travel to Mount Doom and destroy the ring.  As a co-op game this one falls into an odd trap when playing with a mix of gamers and non-gamers.  The gamers will tend to map out all the best options before non-gamers really get their bearing and the non-gamers end up being ordered around and often feel like seat warmer.  After just a few plays it is easy to solve the game every time.  Despite my love of all things LOTR, this game will probably collect a lot of dust at my house.  I have not tried any expansions and it is possible that they add more depth to the game.  It was fun for a few plays, despite the fact that I felt like I was playing solitaire with four warm bodies.

This cooperative does a very good job of building tension and rewarding unselfish play.  I'm pleasantly surprised with the positive influence/impact this has on my children.  They really want to help each other.

Years on, this decent game has been eclipsed (for me by other, more interesting co-operative games), but still thematic and interesting.
The lovably silly plastic monolithic one-eyed "Sauron" playing piece has to be the most feared single game piece in the history of board games. A great game, even more recommended if you're a big Tolkein fan.

I am unsure of how I feel about this game: On the one hand, it is well-themed, the artwork is astounding, and the spirit of fun is refreshing in our ultra-competitive GeekWorld. On the other, it feels weird to be playing "against a board" and it does seem to drag on a bit if you add the expansions. Seems like Sauron has a very tough time fending off the hobbitses...

                                         Traded for record californication from RHCP.
Tried to play it once with a nongamer who is interested in my games and who suggested to play this. We stopped after half an hour. Felt that it was too much scripted. And that there was too much luck involved. Don't have the urge to take it of the shelves again.
However having read a lot about it. I decide to give this another shot. And have at least a three player game. I'm very curious if this will go down well. I don't expect too much from it.

This game is either super hard, or really easy for me. I have only played it maybe a dozen times, but I either easily breeze through ... or terrible terrible things happen to my party. Most of the time we all die in our quest. I find the game to be a little long, but still fun. It's something you have to be in the mood for. I never really liked it enough to get into the expansions.

RATING: 3
Game? Well, that's a loose translation of the word. It felt like I was playing with a three year old that kept taking the toys away from me saying "MINE!". Great art and actually a decent concept but it tries so hard to be true to the story that it takes all decisions out of your hand. Played it enough times that I figured out the exact timing of when to play cards and never could lose after that. Then played it as a group with all the expansions and realized that it was more an excercise in telling other players what to play and when. Those that were new just did what the others said and those that knew the game just excercised their previous knowledge. It's boring. It's boring. It's boring. If you like having no excercise in decision making and relish just watching something happen in front of you that you have no control over, go watch the movies.

Now, I must admit, when I first bought it, all the neat pieces (especially the eye of Sauron) and the artwork really sucked me in. The fact that I could play solo also appealed to me (don't get much time with other people), I played it through about 5 or 6 times, beat it and then continued to beat it every time after that. About six months later I played with a group of people and this time the expansions were included. I found myself telling everybody what they needed to do (and I'm NOT a bossy person) in order to win. They did. We did. Game over. Everyone just sat there looking at the board in wonder that it was that boring. I give it a slightly higher rating than a 1 only because it did entertain for a short time and the bits are very nice, but I really cannot be lead to believe it's worth spending a massive amount of money or time on ever again.

Hmmm.  Played a couple of times with my 5-year-old, because he likes cooperative games, but this isn't one he asks for.  (We lost both times.)  Then, the first time I played this with my brothers (Sauron on 15), we won; looking at how Sauron did, we figured we could've beaten him if he'd started on 9, so we played a second time with Sauron on 10, and won again.  This just has something missing for me; I probably won't play this with adults again, unless [i]maybe[/i] with non-gamers.

I used to like this game. A lot. But every time I play it, the luck drives me a little further up the wall. If sundials start showing up one after the other from the start of a board right from the get go, mitigation is completely out of the question. I have even tried to look beyond the luck and enjoy the game purely for the experience, but with every successive play I can feel the fun being sucked out of me a little more each time.

I would recommend this game very highly to anyone who can handle having a game fuck them up the ass without so much as a reach around. But heed this warning: When you think you've used enough lube, use more lube.

Bad components, finnish rules are written very badly so you'll need the original english rules if you want to play it correctly. Unfortunately the game itself is "scripted" so all you need to do is follow the action disc rules: ok, so now I have to move one step towards the darkness... oh, now I can play some cards etc. Then there is this teamwork -element, which isn't my favorite. Conclusion = boring game.

RATING: 6
While this is a good game, it suffers from a couple of points. For one, it is much too difficult (at least the times I've played it). I've never won a game where we played with the correct rules. The other point is that because it's a co-operative game, a knowledgable intelligent player will naturally tend to dominate the groups' strategy.

In my first aborted play, I found the instructions hard to follow, but my second play with an experienced friend instructing us how to play went far better and proved interesting.  With five players, we did not end up having much tension in the journey to Mordor as we won rather easily despite the foreboding tales my friends sought to weave of previous failings (with less hobbits).  I'll be interested in trying this one with 1-2 of the expansions in the future.  Tried with Friend and Foes and that added a couple interesting twists.  I also discovered that three player makes for a much more difficult game as we were destroyed by Sauron in Shelob's Lair.  Oh well!

WOW, this game is hard. My cousins an I tried this today and it felt awesomely easy to play, awesomely hard to win. 

It's just not "bad luck" everytime you lose, I felt after two games that there were some things that we could do to prevent the end. I need to play this more to have a more accurate veredict, this rating is temporary because of the laughs and fun we had throughout the whole two games. 

[Played mostly with 3-4]

Edit: I finally won... it felt great. The tight strategy of the 3 people playing the game finally paid off and we didn't even let Sauron get 2 spaces from its original space. It was awesome... I need to play again to see if I raise my rating.

Games with 2-players didn't impress me.

Since then I have played with more people and it works better once you figure out that certain options are better than others. Further more people adds characters to take more damage.

I think the best thing about this game is the sense of urgency it instills - something I haven't quite got from any other game. There are constant sacrifices of things that you'd like to do but can't risk taking the time and allowing Sauron to draw closer. Very nice artwork on the boards as well.

Some luck involved in drawing the tiles - a run of events tiles drawn at the beginning of a board can end the game. 

One problem is I think we incorporated the expansions too soon - we were not yet able to beat the basic game and added in the Friends & Foes and then the Sauron expansion which both seem to add more difficulty. We've recently removed the expansions and gone back to the regular game so we're able to *almost* win again.

I am more susceptible to flights of fancy than some of my colleagues so the theme is ok for me.  However, the themes real strength is to provide an efficient framework for the game which is familiar to millions of people.  This familiarity enables a high level of accessibility, and for someone who finds it difficult to explain rules, a narrative tool to aid explanation and understanding of the game.  Without the theme what is left is a beautiful and robust system which challenges and involes each player.  While I feel it lacks the high-levels of tension of Pandemic (the current darling of the co-operative games genre) its accesibility means that each player grasps the game quicker and can contribute earlier therefore avoiding the loudest voice dominating which affects many co-operative games.  A wonderful game which I would enjoy playing in groups of 2-4.  I will never play with a fifth player as I am sure I would get the Fatty card.

Despite the great artwork this game really fails to convey its theme, as it just feels like a race against the clock hand management of resources with a little bit of set collection, rather than an epic journey.

RATING: 4
Has the variety and imagination of a co-operative solitare. You can make it difficult, sure, but you can't make it challenging. You can make the game more difficult either by limiting the number of steps that end the game of by ignoring the obvious strategy in order to "experience the story through the game". These, however, don't help at all. The first option is like playing the same co-op solitare as before, but with fewer piles of cards. The latter, in turn, is just imagining some restrictive rules of your own and trying to beat the game in spite of them. Either way, to me, it doesn't really fit the description of a game as it not a form of amusement.

LotR isn't like any other game I've ever played - I really dig the cooperative scenario thing.

I also have these expansions:

[GameID=2449]: good expansion to base game - brings a lot mre problems for the hobbits, but also some good resources for them.

[ImageID=12404]

[GameID=3819]: don't really like this one, but I'm using some of the cards with LotR and Friends & Foes. Makes F&F a little easier, especially with the powerful Watchful Peace.

[ImageID=9710]

[expansions from Tanga]

[Fantasy Flight]

This is actually a great game because it is fully cooperative and has its own unique way of telling the story of the whole trilogy. The art is nice and different from the movies i a good way. Definitely recommend it.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well this played with a fairly non-gaming group.  It really pulled people into a cooperative mood.  The story boards are nicely designed, and the game as a whole is quite evocative of the books.

Mon jeu coopératif préféré. Je n'ai pas été emballé par les autres auxquels j'ai joué (Ghost Stories, etc.). Celui-ci me parle par son thème, j'aime l'adaptation de l'œuvre. Et puis c'est un jeu de Knizia.

RATING: 7.2
Outstanding for its cooperative-instead-of-competitive paradigm.  I've heard it's very difficult for the players to win.  If you play it a lot and get frustrated with this, you may end up tweaking it to make winning a little likelier.  Some parents will really like playing this game with their children because it rewards cooperation.  You can play it with younger children than most other games, because as your child's team-mate, you can help her handle difficult bits.

A run cooperative game that was of the first in the genre.  Players take on the roll of one of the Hobbits from LotR's.  You are trying to make it to Mordor and discard the Ring in mount doom.  You play cards and work on multiple paths.  Events come out, cause the Eye to move on a track toward the hobbits or possibly to have bad events occur.  

If you make it to Mount Doom and discard the ring you win and there are a number of ways to lose.  

I really like this game.  It is very fun and great for families.

I'd rather put together a puzzle with LoTR artwork with a few friends or join a reading group that is re-reading the trilogy than try this non-game activity again.  Seriously, how is this a game?  Where is the tension?  I don't get it obviously.

i think it could be also played as a solitaire, so i can't feel its challenge. No competitive interaction between players, i think it could be more fun if someone could be designated to play sauron (never played with the expansions). Superb artwork and solid themed tho.

Only one solo play so far but I liked it.  Really gives you the feeling of a journey.  Yes, it's Knizia and at times the theme does feel a little pasted on but it's such a great theme I don't mind.  I love the artwork, the cards, the boards. It all looks really nice and I can't wait to try it with my friends.  

UPDATE:  After playing with 4 players I can't say I enjoyed it.  It's all presented very nicely but I just couldn't get into the game.  The theme is pasted on and it starts to show after a while.  The journey quickly turned monotonous.  Maybe I'll try it again soon.

RATING: N/A
Seems to be described as a Gamer's Game. NOT for the casual gamer. 

A worthwhile cooperative, but seems to be more suited for those who appreciate or enjoy the LotR theme.

Rulebook is not as good as Pandemic's.
Game is cooperative (like Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot and Ghost Stories). Given my group of kids, I'd stick with Pandemic (especially due to theme) and Paradise Island.

Cooperative games like Ghost Stories and Death Angel are too hard to win and therefore make the gaming experience less fun.

RATING: 5
Fell flat the three or four times I played it. It's so linear.  There is certainly strategy/tactics to it...but you often feel like the game is playing you rather than the other way around.

RATING: 7.8
Excellent cooperative game. Every game so far has been fun with a very tense ending. Non-gamers, especially those who hate sticking it to other players, have really enjoyed it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
the game features the usual intelligent mechanisims common to all Knizia's games, I'd say that in this case theme and game play help each other more than in his other games.
I believe that in order to better enjoy the cooperative spirit of the game the rules should be revised in order to introduce some trade off between each player path and the fellowship common goal.
The components are generally good except for the tokens that seem to belong to a different box. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

With expansions: 4-6 hours :-P

Great design though, original and flavorfull - the sauron token, and the way it closes in on the hobbits, are downright scary!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good for a cooperative game, though does feel a bit linear and like playing a system, better with F&F.

Update: this is the best co-op game invented.  Having tried many others, none have the stress or the difficult decisions of this one.   SOC, Touch of Evil etc, are good in their way, but the decisions are too blah and just don't have that "What the heck do we do now?" tension.
 It's also brilliant solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not at all what I expected going in to the game.  Kind of a weird set collecting/ co-op game.  I usually hate co-op games, but this one seemed to keep players fairly autonomous so it keeps this one from becoming a leader & followers co-op.  Like most Knizia, the theme seems pasted on.

This one is really growing on me. We even got my Mum to sit down and play and my Dad then flat out demanded that we play it again straight afterwards. Would be interesting to see what the expansions add to it as I can see it becoming a bit too samey if played too many times.

RATING: 7
Great co-operative game in which the Fellowhip tries to best the trials of their journey to Mordor.  I have found that success is most assured with 3 players.  It's very difficult to overcome a lot of early bad luck.

Decent gameplay for an old cooperative game. The art though is lacking for some components, namely the tiles, which look like they were made with clipart. The game boards are very nice though. Definitely set a solid standard for other cooperative games.

Cooperative game with some nice mechanics (there's luck but also decisions and debates between the players).
I prefer it with 4 players (but can be a fine solitaire as well).
It can't be played a lot of times one after the other (too repetitive in the sequence of "bad events"), but it's still nice when you play it (again) after some time.

Beautiful looking game, extremely well-made and graphically stunning.  Other than that, what?  I could play this game solo.  With no tension between the players trying to individually win while also trying to beat Sauron, there is simply no reason to have other players.  And then what is the point?  The idea of a cooperative game has merit, but this falls way flat.

Fun co-op game, but the rules are a little fuzzy. It's easier to just try to play the game and learn then actually read through the rulebook. 

Before I played I felt like the theme was a little pasted on, but after a few playthroughs it feels better. Might get a little stale after many plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Despite owning it longer, I've played this less than the Pandemic series, in part because LotR has more moving parts and exceptions. Nevertheless, it's an excellent cooperative game that I'm still happy to play.

The card play is only conceptually related to the books, but everything else evokes the story. Post-game discussions always end up sounding something like an alternative epic. Playing with my kids after a serialized viewing of Jackson's trilogy was a gaming high point for me.

I bought this game because my youngest son (currently 15 years old) was complaining about the competitiveness of other games.  Near the end of the first time that we played it he said, "you know, I kind of like this game -- you have to work together to be able to win, you're not out to get the other player."  The purchase was well worth it -- everyone in the family likes the game.  The game succeeds in recreating the feel of the books -- having to work together against increasingly difficult odds.

I couldn't get into this. Instructions incomprehensible and long - even the Rules Summary is 4 pages long! I felt the game mechanics lacked consistency, and I felt the cards were pointless (why not use chits instead?) - the whole point of cards in a board game is that they should add something extra to your player charcter,  so that you have make a reasoned decision about which ones to keep and which to discard. Great art and board design though. Shame, could have been great ...

Another Knizia wonder. One of the few games that has me on the edge of my seat wondering whether we'll turn over another hobbit-mangling event card or get some relief with an activity card. Truly brilliant! The need for co-operation  and sacrifice between the players makes this game unique and an excellent one for kids to appreciate the value of teamwork (instead of the "it's mine, mine, mine" approach) in a thoroughly enjoyable way (even when you're cast into darkness by Sauron!). Time allowing, this one always get an immediate replay whenever the box comes out (which is often).

     It's a teamwork game and in all honesty, I find it rather boring.  The gameplay is so abstract and thematically void that it fails to immerse you in Tolkien's world. Though Howe's art does help alot in healing this, the counter chits are absolutely horrifying in comparison.  Also, a very repetitive game. You NEED the Friends and Foes expansion if you hope to stomach this one.  It doesn't help that i'm not a fan of teamwork.  Speaking of that, why not play the best coop game ever? Shadows over Camelot.

The theme isn’t exactly my cup of tea but luckily it’s only a matter of illustration in the usual Knizia style.

Not really intuitive or coherent though - too many elements seem just glued on.

RATING: 6
The card and board art are very nice, which just makes the cheap tokens seem that much cheaper.  The game flows well, following the story line but keeping it simple, and the mechanics mesh well with the theme.  Double-sided boards maintain flavor without it getting unwieldy.  I like cooperative games but hate the way they often end up being one-player directed; this one seems to resist that tendency, which is refreshing.  There's a lot of luck in the tile-drawing; the game can kill you before you even have a chance to play.  There are some workarounds (buy a Gandalf power to reorder the next few tiles, ignore the effects of one tile), but unless you've done well enough to stash away a bunch of extra points, you can't buy those effects.  So it's not on my all-time faves list just because you are pretty much at the game's mercy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Your experience with this game will definitely depend on your gaming group. The first two groups I played with it seemed really dry.  The third group I tried it with, we had a good time with some joking around about the story.  I still prefer other cooperative games (e.g., Shadows over Camelot), but I think LotR has earned itself a place in the rotation.

With more plays, I find this game being enjoyed and requested more than I initially would have thought.  I still usually turn to Pandemic (especially now with the expansion), but this definitely has earned a rotation spot.

I've only played this once, and with other people who were not too clear about some of the rules, so maybe it didn't get a fair shake, but here goes:
First of all, the productions seems pretty simple and plain compared to Shadows Over Camelot.   The graphics are quite inconsistent: some of the backgrounds on the boards are great, but the cards and bits are quite ugly.  This being a cooperative game, there didn't seem to be much choice or intrigue, and we won fairly handily.

One of a kind game that incorporates cooperative play. Great artwork and immersive, makes you feel like you are really on a quest to destroy the ring.  A great 2-player experience, have yet to try it with more.  On the downside, set-up time is a bit long and the tiles are too small.  I recommend that you use a bag to draw them out of. The new FFG version is a huge improvement over the previous edition, especially with the clarity and organization of the rulebook.

2 Plays - before I starting logging plays.

Good job going out there and making something different. Rings theme is a bit stifling to the open-ness of the design. Event cards and ring-use rolls introduce a MAJOR luck factor.

You'd think with a co-op version of my favorite books of all time, I'd love the game. Sadly, it just fell completely flat. I hated the entire experience. The card art was spotty, the mechanics didn't play well, it just sucked. My least favorite co-op.

Lots of stuff, but relatively few rules -- and a co-op experience that's unlike any other co-op game I've played. I love that it emulates the feel -- and events -- of the series so well, what with sacrificing people, the steady march towards corruption, and the themes of the different tracks and regions. Plus, it's got beautiful components (revamped Silver Line version is great).

Of the Knizia games I've played, this is the one with the tightest connection to, and strongest expression of, its theme. An all-around awesome game.

RATING: N/A
LOTR themed. And it gets better! 
Really fun game, co-op at it's best. Cards and the Ring are really nicely balanced with the theme.
I have the 2000th edition in German, artwork on the boards and the most of the cards is nice. On the other hand, the Sauron mini, tiles and tokens look quite silly, but I can live with that. Also in my opinion, German language took much of the theme flavor, but this is the only version that I could have bought so I went for it. I'm not sorry, but I would like the game better in English.

Rating after one play.  I don't like some cooperative games and this one was no exception.  In the last five years of my life of games, I have not played a game that I like less than this one.  I was bored the entire time.  Didn't feel a part of anything at all.  Boring with a capital B.  Both LotR: The Confrontation and War of the Ring are much, much, much better games.  Play those if you like LotR.  Of course, if coop is your thing you might like this, even then try before you buy.  Thankfully, I have never owned this 'game'.  And yes, I have played RPGs plenty and enjoyed them, but they aren't coop by my definition - ymmv.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Now that I've played twice I feel I can place an early rating. To me the game is good -- I'll play it if somebody wants to but won't suggest it as often as some other games. It feels messy to me -- too many cards, too little space. It's good, but not great.

Recently replayed the base game five or six times, two player and solo. This thing kicks ass, then and now. Every gamer owes it to themselves to play this at least a few times. Even if the game is not for you, it is a joy to observe Knizia at work. Lots to appreciate here.

One of the most original and inventive games I have seen in a decade. The "Magic Flute" of 1990s game design. The way the theme reveals itself in very subtle (and chromeless) ways through player behavior and interaction is stunning. For my money this is Knizia's best design since Modern Art. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've seen so many people rail on this game because it's basically just an abstract game with some LOTR pictures pasted on top. I really enjoy this game, and think it evokes a LOTR feel, but not in the way you would think. When most games try and go for a specific theme, they will have you physically do things related to that theme. A LOTR game might have you move your pieces around and fight orcs. But that's not how this game evokes theme. This game evokes the LOTR theme by making the optimal play to win the game be by sacrificing yourself for another player (most of the time). This game is extremely hard to win, and when you do win, you normally have to win by having one or more players sacrificing themselves, so another player can "carry the ring" to Mount Doom to win the game. In that sense, I think this game evokes the LOTR theme beautifully, because it makes you do LOTR themed things (sacrifice for another) without telling you specifically to do those things. That's pretty cool in my book.

I have this game as well as a couple of expansions.  Saw it at Goodwill one day for two dollars, opened it up to check the pieces, and there I found not only all the pieces, but the pieces and rules from the first two expansions!  Needless to say I snapped this up, and haven't regretted it since!  I haven't played it as much as I would like, only a handful of times, but everything has been so hectic since I purchased it from moving apartments to planning a wedding that I just haven't had time.

It has a lot of theme, really nice artwork, a lot of tension. But I do have two major complaints: it is too random (i mean the event tiles) and while playing it I don't feel like I'm playing my part independently. Instead I feel all players should play like they're just one player - because there's always an optimal move to take.

This falls into the "too damn hard" co-op category. I love the theme, I feel the theme when playing the game overall, but not at the individual mechanism level.

Of the expansions, only Friends and Foes seems worthwhile."Sauron" is at least interesting as an expansion. "Battlefields" is just clever, it doesn't really add anything IMO.

This is a fantastic cooperative game. At first glance you wouldn’t think the mechanics have anything to do with the theme but it actually captures the flavor of LofR quite well. You WILL be quoting lines from the movie. If you’re the bossy type and are playing with newbies just bite your tongue and accept that you are going to lose the game. Let new player discover the strategies for themselves. If you enjoy the Lord of the Rings books or movies then this game is highly recommended.

Game in a Nutshell: Cooperative game where players take on the roles of the hobbits taking the ring to Mordor.

Played as: 3 player

Played with: Only the base game.

Pros: Presents a good challenge that ramps up as you move along. I like the progression from one board to the next, creating a sense of progression towards mount doom. The amount of flavor text (very little) seems appropriate, with nothing being bogged down by it. Nice artwork.

Cons: I'm really tiring of Fantasy Flight rulebooks. The game really abstracts things to a point that it's hard to remember there's a larger picture. Going on about "needing a sun token" is not the same as actually feeling like things are grim and the psyches of the hobbits are falling apart.

Other: I played this long after newer more popular co-ops came along and it's hard to point out anything this game does better than those at this point in time.

Best Use: Lord of the Ring junkies have their family game.

This cooperative game is a masterpiece.  In particular, it captures the spirit of the novels much better than the dozens of war/battle games based on the books.  Most of the story is about agonizing choices and being nearly overwhelmed by events.  

It also has good replay value.  Style of play is affected by the size of the party.  The expansions ramp up the difficulty for those who master the base game (I'm getting there.)  Two-player is the hardest, I think.

Excellent co-op that steals from the orignal Arkham Horror, Minion Hunter, Star Wars co-op, The Keep, and adds a few new twists of its own.

NB: Unplayable without the player's aids avaliable here on BGG.  Almosts needs F&F to play well, but I've never played a complete game without that expansion.

I think that more people don't play this game because they tried it without the player's aids from BGG.  They got a bad taste for it, then gave up on it.  If they only knew what they were missing.  Better than the new AH because this one plays fast and smooth.  It does not have the horror element, but I prefer Minion Hunter for that feel.

A good-looking game that succeeds reasonably well. It seems like there's enough variety in the card draw to make each game different, but the scripted nature of the events seems like a single dominant/efficient strategy would emerge for those familiar with all the game boards. At this point in my experience, it seems to be a very tough nut to crack: no wins yet. I'll have to reserve judgment until I've played it more, however I doubt I'll play it all that often. A 6 feels about right.

It's certainly a lovely game, and it's got enough going for it that I don't hold against it the fact that it was designed by Knizia.

A cooperative game: makes for a nice change.  Great graphics.  We make it a point to NOT look ahead at the next events, and to not play often enough to remember what's coming.  We DON'T always give the ring to Sam, and we DON'T sacrifice ourselves automatically for the win.  It makes the game MUCH more fun when one loses a lot with an occassional victory, rather than the ridiculously high scores people keep reporting.

Evocative, tense, and engaging.  After years of playing this it remains among my all time favorites.  Plays wonderfully with or without expansions, but I enjoy it especially with both expansions and all optional rules in use.  Playing Sauron is great fun, as is playing against a player-Sauron.

One of the most intense and positive gaming experiences on a consistent basis.

[u]02-Aug-2015[/u]:  This is an early cooperative game themed around the Lord of the Rings (obviously).  You must take a number of Hobbits through four conflict boards to reach Mt Doom.  There, you must successfully destroy the Ring before Sauron claims it and brings horror to the lands of Middle Earth.

The game is essentially a card/resource management game.  Each Hobbit has a hand of cards which allows the entire Fellowship to move along their journey.  The card represent various aspects of survival for the Hobbits, including combat, hiding, friendship, and travel.  Each Hobbit also gains up to three attributes on each board, otherwise, they will move closer to Sauron on the corruption track.

If at least one Hobbit makes to Mt Doom and successfully throws in the Ring, the Fellowship wins.

There are lots of things I enjoy about this game.  The cardplay is fantastic.  I really enjoy managing the cards for each of the Hobbits, when to spend them, which ones to spend, and who acquires new ones.  Combine this with the "resources" of those attributes, and you have a really nice hand management game.

I also love that there is player elimination in this game.  As long as one Hobbit can make it to the end, you have a chance to defeat evil.  There is a corruption track which shows how close Sauron is to gaining the ring, as well as how much under the Ring's spell the Hobbits have succumbed.  If a Hobbit and Sauron meet on this track, the Hobbit is out of the game, as he has gone too far into his obsession with the Ring.

As these two forces come closer and closer on the corruption track, the tension of the game increases.  Then, when one, and then another, Hobbit are removed from the game, that tension just skyrockets.

For me, this is also where the theme comes through...that feeling of tension and desperation as the endgame comes nearer.  I enjoy the LotR IP, but I am not a fanboy.  I don't know all the ins and outs of the lore, and I think I miss out on the story while playing the game because of this.  Again, the tension is there.  The "feel" of LotR is there for me but not the narrative.  But that's just me.

Overall, an excellent cooperative game that most gamers should give a look.

I couldn't believe a cooperation game where you play against the board could be so fun, challenging and hold so much tension.  This game is simply amazing and impressively holds true to it's theme.

UPDATE:  Bumped rating down from 10 to 8.  I still really enjoy this game -- especially when played with the right group who will delve into the story rather than just play through the mechanics.  The game always seems to come down to the wire.

The cooperative aspect is a refreshing change of pace, but the game seems to be fairly light on both tactics/strategy(if you have to make a sacrifice, don't choose the ringbearer, try to keep more 'powerful' cards for the later more difficult boards), and it seems a little heavy on the luck(the portion of event causing tiles drawn pretty much determines how well/poorly you'll do).

I've been reading and loving Tolkien since I was 10 years old.  Played it once, more than enough to know I never want to play it again.  It's all scripted, there is no game to be played.  I'd rather play Scrabble...or Monopoly...or anything.  This game BLOWS!  And I have to dump an expansion too!  Yikes...try before you buy!  It's like a group game of Go Fish.  Awful awful awful!!!

An old (original?) co-op, but so far I have only really played it solo - and I really like it!

The theme is obviously a big draw for me, but I like the strategy and card play behind the theme.  Sure, there is a lot of luck involved (event tile draw, card draw, dice rolls), but I feel like I still have some control over what I do, whether it be using the ring or choosing which line to advance

I hope to play this a lot more as a solo, but given its age I doubt I could convince my group to play it as there are way too many more 'modern' co-op games out there

This is my first co-op game in my collection, though I like game with tenser confrontation, this game really surprised me. After playing a few games, I think this game is better be played by 4-5 players because the interaction between players is what makes the game shined. And if you want to win the game, "Cooperation" & "Sacrifice" are the keywords!

My brother hates this - it's his game and he loves LotR, but he just couldn't handle his first game of this. Some people just don't like cooperative games, I find.

Half of the games with a friend who always wanted to sacrifice my hobbits for "the greater good" and half the times with... my mother, I told her what to do and she had lots of fun to see how the game developed.

Realy fun game with the Tolkien experience and a lot of tension. Want to pick it up again with the Sauron expansion and finally beat Sauron once and forever, till the next game ofcourse.

Not as good as its rating here, but I have fond, fond memories of this one. My first co-op + LOTR theme = LOTS of playtime in the early collection. I think there's still fun to be had here, but it's a harsh mistress (luck plays an almost unacceptably large role, even for a co-op) and is hard to recommend in the face of better designs. Still, if you were there back in the day and played this one, I think you'll agree with the rating.

I played this a bit back when it first came out and found it interesting, pleasantly faithful to the books (of course there was no movies to be faithful to back then) and quite different - it was the first co-op game. Then I soon got bored of it.

The game got new life in 2013, when I rebought it. My son's now six, a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and thus the game's just about perfect for him. I don't really have any interest in this game, except with him. My rating reflects that; with my son, I'd rate this an 8. (Though, actually, we much prefer the Lord of the Rings Deck-building games.)

Indifferent.

RATING: 7
An early cooperative, and still one of the best. There's much to admire in this design, and yet I've never found playing the game to be a great deal of fun. It just seems like a lot of work to get to the fourth board, where, no matter how good of shape you seem to be in, it often all goes south very quickly. [25 plays, just two wins, once with three, once with four]

This is the coop game by Reiner Knizia. I love the idea of coop play, but for two players the game was just impossible to beat.  After playing several times, we added a third player, and then the game became a piece of cake..   This game is good for a few rounds, but tires kind of quickly.

I really like this. It just works. I did feel very hobbitty (made that up) playing this with my friends. The theme of the books/film was ever present with sauron pulling the ring to him and us guys desperately trying to resist.

I initially thought, "How bad can it be?" and picked this up to test how much of a sucker I am for the Lord of the Rings theme.

The first game was quite dull, but I did enjoy the theme. We also got demolished, which piqued my interest in trying again. Two tries later, we won and have minimal interest in playing again. (We subsequently realized we had one rule wrong and still feel done with the game.)

There are some minimally interesting decisions on how to handle each scenario and when to expend your resources through out the game. But mostly it just feels like you're being taken for a ride on the random tile flips. Lots of event tiles early on = you're screwed. Not so many = cake walk.

UPDATE: My faith in Knizia has me thinking I "could be talked into" this again, especially with the Sauron expansion. Upped my rating a notch.

I'm not a huge fan of co-operative games, but I would choose LotR over Pandemic, Forbidden Island or any other traditional co-operative game I've played since (I'm excluding Hanabi & Escape).  The LotR base game is fine.  I don't think the expansions are needed.  However, Friends & Foes & Sauron play very well and add a lot to the experience.  Battlefields is a side-game tacked on to the regular game: it feels very disconnected to me.

Nice coop game, but I find a little too often that the game plays you instead of you playing the game.  If you get in a bad luck chain of events, sometimes all you do is burning ressources that you know will need for later and you know that it spells doom but later.  Many times I found that we lost everything in the first boards, and good play will just postpone the inevitable.

It's hard not to be entranced by the fantastic layering of theme, but it's also hard not to be a bit put out when the tiles are against you. I'd really love to see some pros take this game on. Rating has gone up.

Botched one game, re-set, and played another, dying in Mordor.  Really need more plays so I can see what the fans are so juiced about.  I want to love it like I do Knizia's other games, I'm just not there yet.

I don't like Knizia Games. They nearly never create the feeling of a thematic game which tells a story. Instead of that they are mostly mathematical and flat. This game in particular has a lot of good Ideas (every Hobbit has a special ability, as the game progresses Sauron becomes a bigger threat, you can use the Ring, it's a cooperative game...), but for me it lacks so much in fun. The activity tiles have nothing to do with the story, are so luck dependent and take away the decision making process. Won't hit the table often.

Great co-op game and adding the Sauron expansion makes it a one vs many game if you want. It's just that we'd now choose a less abstract co-op, or a true one vs many game (like Descent or Buffy) ahead of this. It should be played and is in great condition even though it's an old game now.

Would prefer to trade with the Sauron expansion. Although, due to it's value, it'll easily sell given time. So not essential for me!

The only game I just "don't get it". The rules are not quite straight forward as maybe I would like them to be, therefore there is so much room for interpretation or simply I/we just don't understand them. We tried to play it like 3 times and each time we either lost in like two-four turns or had a flawless victory with no problems whatsoever.

This should be the poster child for cooperative games, not Pandemic. This game is all about sacrifice for the good of the team, and I don't think it gets much more cooperative than that. Drawing from the bag can be frustrating sometimes, but the game presents a very interesting puzzle to solve. If Pandemic is the father of modern co-ops, this is definitely the grandfather.

The expansions really breathe a lot of life into this game. This has quickly shot up into the position of being one of my favorite co-op games again, even after being one of the first ones I played after I got into the hobby.

A gift from Luke and Lydia who are sadly soon heading back to the UK.  

Was graciously given this, and the 'Friends & Foes' expansion, as their collection is being thinned down before they leave.  A game I have been interested in trying / picking up but couldn't justify the price.

Thank you!

The article Reiner Knizia - Master of Theme made me interested in this cooperative game (http://www.nohighscores.com/2014/09/18/cracked-lcd-reiner-knizia-master-of-theme/) but comments about not very interesting decisions made me hesitate. Nevertheless, I find that Lord of the Rings have some interesting decisions, such as which cards to play, which tracks to follow, which hobbit to get which cards/rewards and least but not last how to manage the corruption track. The game may not have Pandemic's elegant mechanism for increasing the tension when epidemics spread but fans of Lord of the Rings may find Knizia's contribution to the cooperative games quite immersive.

The Benchmark for other cooperative games, Reiner Knizia masterpiece. This game is so well balanced, if it gets too easy, many different options too make it more difficult.  But every game is different and every game has lasting memories. Better play it with people from the same level. But this game has been the most played in my group for sure, and they are all big Gamerz, not casual, but hardcore! Once you understand the game , you are amazed by its marvelous mechanics and how it's so well balanced.

Took ages to figure out how to beat this but had great fun in the attempt.  Probably prefer this solo to be honest as the gameplay is so abstract that with other people there I keep having to remind them what the shields represent and why we're progressing along this track or the other, etc.  Beautiful artwork, best theme ever, but strangely Euro - I still have a lot of time for this game and would love to track down some of the old expansions for it.

I don't get all the positive comments about this game.  I found it to be thoroughly mechanical and boring.  It's all about whether you've got the right cards, and either you've got 'em or you don't.  If you don't, eventually you lose.  Further, when it is time to play cards it's pretty obvious what the best play is.  Yes, I like the manner in which Sauron gets closer and closer.  That's a neat design trick that attempts to capture a sense of increasing tension...it's just that there's no tension.  Like I say, the game boils down to either you've got the cards or you don't.  Play 'em.  Rinse and repeat.  

As someone who re-read Lord of the Rings 6 months ago, I found this game to capture very little that is in the story.  Well, except for the art.  The art is great, and the physical production is top notch.  But the game simply isn't my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun, unique cooperative game by Knizia where everyone plays a hobbit trying to throw the ring into Mount Doom before Sauron corrupts everyone. Everyone gets involved in the discussion on how the party should plan it's next move. Some people don't like it since 1) there may not be any control if too many event tiles show up 2) it can be viewed as a multiplayer solitarire game, and 3) some people can dominate the decisions of the party. Despite these minor drawbacks, a good solid game.

RATING: 6
Great mechanics. Always love the theme even though it feels slightly painted on to mechanics--but only slightly. Well made came with lots of decision making and tension; not the best ever but always a rewarding couple of hours.

Rating is 8 or higher when the expansions, at least the Friends and Foes one are included.

UPDATE: still a great game but shows its age and its Knizia ishness. You do get the FEEL of having to struggle to move forward so there's a similar feel as LOTR, but it's all done in such an overly abstract way. There are just better coops out now and the latest expansions is like doing a flowchart in the most non thematic way possible. This game is fun for what it is and I enjoy playing it but with the selection of coop games, even Euroesque coop games out there, I'd rather play those than LOTR. Also War of the Ring doesn't take that much longer once you learn rules and is a MUCH better MUCH more thamatic game. Yes it's not euro and its competative but still for a LOTR experience, I'll just play LOTR. This game is good for what it is, but there are better coop options, better LOTR options, and just plain better games that I'd rather play even though this one is enjoyable enough.

One of the first coop games, and it shows a bit as it doesn't offer as much as the recent offerings. But I did enjoy playing it, even solo, and I love the way the corruption by the Ring is handled on the track with Sauron and the hobbits moving: nice, simple and thematic.

I am astounded by the number of people who think that this is a brilliantly designed game.  It all boils down to the order in which the good and bad tiles are shuffled.  Constant bad tile clumpage at the top of the stack means your cards vanish and you lose, no matter how efficiently you cooperate.  It's like going to a strip club and having to hand over all of your dollar bills to the bouncer before getting in the door.

Years later the 10 ratings still holds up.  This is a simply brilliant design - an opinion bolstered by the difficulty other recent collaborative efforts (Shadows over Camelot, Arkham Horror) have had at attaining a similar level of tension, replayability, and overall excitement.

This game doesn't feel fluid while playing it. It can sway so much depending on the tile flip.

Anytime I have introduced this to someone it has never gone well. Many people seem to have no real strategy since you don't really know what is coming up next unless you have played the game a few times. I'm sure it's fun once every player has some experience with it but there are so many other cooperative games that are so much better.

The 1st 10-12 minutes of Lord Of The Rings don't involve any actual play. Everyone just stares at the Frodo player as he/she goes through a bunch of scripted actions. Comments like "What's going on?", "Okay, what are we doing?", and "That was the first/second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth turn?!" abound. It is not gameplay,  just extended setup. 

The cooperative aspects of LotR come into play when players are versed in the games mechanics and know what threats they will be facing and how best to approach them.

I think if this game didn't have such lovely artwork it wouldn't be remembered as fondly as it has been 10+ years since its release and if it didn't have the Lord Of The Rings license it wouldn't be remembered at all. Why would anyone consider this a good game? How a game this bad kickstarted the cooperative gaming genre I will never understand.

As a final note, if you actually like this game and want a copy yourself, do not buy the Fantasy Flight Games Silver Line Edition! It is the bargain model. Plastic figures and the metal One Ring have been replaced with cardboard. Terrible! Shame on you Fantasy Flight!

This is a great game. The difficulty in winning really reflects the mood of the books I think. When playing with a Sauron player, the game can be very difficult to win. Most times, what you need to do is fairly straightforward, it's mainly a matter of pressing your luck. The game really works as long as people enjoy the feeling of tension that the game creates, but don't mind that the game can take wide swings in fate depending on a single tile pull.

I've never not had fun playing this game. It's really a fantastic game with a great deal of flavor that is very well integrated into the mechanics. You do need the right crowd, and I think the only reason this gets a 10 is that I've always played it with the right crowd. In a lot of ways this is really the perfect game to me. 

After nearly a year with only 1 or 2 plays, this game has slipped a bit on my list. The more we play with all of the expansions the more it feels a bit like banging ones head into a wall constantly, and the less fun it gets. Still a spectacular game, but no longer a perfect game in my eyes. Also, the latest expansion is a disaster and should be avoided at all cost - stick to base plus F&F.

This game is very unique (at least to me) in its way to play. That can make it harder to understand than it actually is. The cooperative nature works IMO because the book is about a fellowship afterall. But the game feels incomplete and that is something that the Friends&Foes expansion fixes with its Bree and Isengard boards and the creatures. I rather not play this game without the expansion, wich is not the way a game should be. Putting it all into one package would have been too much though so my final rating is 6.

RATING: 10
Fantastic level of tension and abstracted theme. Set collection strategy is a lot of fun. Very dramatic.

I thought this one might drop from the 10 ranking after many plays, but going on a dozen plays it has not let up. Brilliant design. How many games actually give a player an opportunity to remove himself from the game entirely as a sacrifice to keep the quest going just a little bit longer? I can't think of many.

Keeps impressing me with how tight of a design it is. I do think it is better for 3+ than for 2, because resources are just so abundant with 2.

Not too bad of a co-op game.  This game really depends on the group as to whether it can be won.  A very giving group will win most of the time, players who hoard cards really hinder the group play.  The rule book is terrible by itself, get one of the player aids here at BGG.

RATING: 7
Rating Modifier : (1 play, 3 players who have fun doing most anything).  I really enjoyed my first game of LoTR, but can't be sure how much was based off of the people I played with and how much was the game's fun factor.  Can't see the game remaining as fun over more plays, though it's excellently produced, evokes the themes, events, and atmosphere of the books, and works well as an attempt at something I never saw the point of before (cooperative game against randomness).  At its core, however, the game is similar to attempting a jigsaw puzzle with a group of friends.

RATING: 8
The components of this game are a mixed bag.  The artwork on the scenario boards is beautiful, as is that on some of the cards.  The rest is just okay.  The plastic, primary-colored Hobbit figures are pathetic.  The rule book is long, but I created a 2 page summary to increase the likelihood of playing again at a later date.  As for play itself, I was not disappointed.  I like cooperative games, and it's particularly fitting that a game about the Fellowship of the Ring should be cooperative.  Working together to overcome obstacles and avoid Sauron lends a certain RPG feel to the game, especially when played with a group of avid LoTR fans, the movie soundtrack playing in the background.  There is a genuine tension and uncertainty in the game that renders a successful completion a real triumph. (4+4)

RATING: 9
"Lord of the Rings" is a pretty amazing design; it shows what Knizia is capable of when he goes full bore into designing a game. 

I really like the cooperative nature of the game, as everyone's in it against Sauron. In addition, however, for each player it's a matter of do-or-die, so there's an individual aspect as well. I'm having a hard time imagining getting tired of playing this on.

As with most Knizia designs, some may find it dry, which is the only caveat I have about this game.

I also have the "Friends and Foes" and "Sauron" expansions. Got the base game in September 2007 via trade.

While this game does have a moderate dose of luck, great cooperative strategy can overcome bad luck. The game is pretty easy to learn, so you aren't stuck rifling through rule books 3+ plays in. I learned the game fully in one playthrough. That said, it still has enough clever mechanics to keep board game "nerds" interested for at least a handful of plays.  The game is very cooperative, often relying on sacrifice and communication and strategy on actions. The art is fantastic. It's very "old school" and I prefer it to any movie licensed art. If you use a little imagination, you can really get into the theme, especially if you're a LotR fan. I really enjoy this game, and see it as an important part of my cooperative board game collection. It has a few flaws. (Note: Im playing the Fantasy Flight Silver Edition) Namely the Adventure Tiles that you flip during the dungeons, which are called "conflicts" I believe. They're a large stack of very small tiles, and the pile topples easily. You also have to "shuffle" them, which is a pain, as they're unwieldy. Cards would have been MUCH better than tiles in that situation. Im considering making my own cards, even. It's that frustrating. The rule book isn't very concise in it's layout, either. Otherwise, I consider this a great addition to my collection. If you like cooperative adventure games with a moderate dose of luck and strategy, and you like LotR, I think you'll really enjoy it.

A little more abstract than I'd have liked. I don't like pure co-ops. The bad events come up randomly, so there is only a loose connection between how well you play and how well you do - a streak of (un)lucky tile draws usually decides the game.

I hate cooperative games.  I hate cooperative games that are advertised as multi-player when you can do it all on your own anyway.  I hate this game.  However, it is balanced, and other people seem to like it.  If you like to play games that do not involve destroying everyone else at the table, or games where everyone can be a "winner" then I suppose you might like this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The basic game (no expansions) provides a nice co-operative experience, trying to make the best use of cards whilst making decisions on what to concentrate on and what to pass on. I suspect the end result is more a function of event tile luck, but the game is fun enough for me to enjoy regardless. I'll play the basic version when we're looking for higher likelihood of a good result and a quicker game, and play the expansions when looking for more of a challenge.

Fun "epic" Tolkien co-op that doesn't feel like Knizia. Art by John Howe.

This co-op has a linear journey, thus focuses more on resource management than tactical board positions.

The lesser graphical art is shameful.

RATING: 10
It's a little odd and different.  Not exactly playing as characters directly, but still very tense and you can play the classic story, with different takes on the plot, in your head as you play.  Highly recommend replacing the cones with the other members of the fellowship via miniatures from LOTR chess sets, Game Workshop sets, trivial pursuit, monopoly, etc.  

Very fun.  Relatively easy to get and somewhat cheap.  Great solo play for the basic LOTR story.

RATING: 8
"One of the earliest modern pure co-ops, but holds up very well. Thematic and abstract at the same time."

What I like:
- Feels epic (usually in 75-90 minutes)
- Four scenario boards are great
- Unusual mechanisms (moving shared pawns)
- Great components in Hasbro edition

What I don't like:
- Tile draws can be swingy
- Rules are pretty poorly organized
- Player elimination can feel harsh

This is an excellent cooperative game, despite being one of the first modern co-ops. It's a race against time, not a battle (which is fine). It is quite abstract in some ways, but thematically you do feel like little hobbits participating in this quest to save the world.

The weight rating on BGG seems too high, as this seems like a simpler game than others rated around 2.6. I think I would give it a 2.4.

I love this game and simply don't play it enough.  Knizia really managed to capture the feel of the books, something that really impressed me considering how dry and disconnected some of his games can be.  The 'Us against the Game' feeling is perfect, as is the slow, corrupting influence of the ring on its bearer.  I've played once withe the Friends and Foes expansion, but wasn't particularly impressed.  I'd definitely like trying the Sauron expansion, though.

Got it on the 23rd of June 2008, traded for Colossal Arena and Mag Blast 3rd Ed. It looks brilliant, it plays the same. It's a great game, production value is very high, although I'd rather have those Hobbits less accurate in design and more resistant, they look extremely fragile. Sauron is super though. Otherwise the game is outstanding. Will have to try it with more then two players though. 

I rose the score for the base game, it plays well solo, so I play it more often now and feel the gameplay much more involving then after the first few games. Well adapted LotR story!

This just did nothing for me.  More puzzle than game, this coop has you guiding the Fellowship through the book.  Never really felt a great deal of tension throughout, always could either handle the immediate problem or eat the consequences without too much risk.  Just didn't work for me.  Using the "competitive" option doesn't help at all, either.

Just fell flat, though likely due to my preference rather than the game itself.  For those that enjoy coops, this one would almost certainly rank right up there.

This game was designed so that you won't succeed to destroy the Ring until several game plays. Played twice so far, & the way the bad event tiles keep coming, really seems impossible and demoralising. Moral courage & persevering spirit needed.

My initial plays gave me a bad impression, but after some more chances, I've changed my mind about this one.  Also, play didn't drag or last as long as some other cooperative games I like, which is good (I like long games, but I like shorter ones, too).  I've always loved Tolkien's books, so I'm way into the theme, and we're getting a hand on the cooperative play, which is really important for this game.  I've gone from "meh" on this, to "good game."  I'm going to order an expansion or two and see what happens with it.

Comment: A wonderful game that doesn't get enough love. I find it quite thematic and while there is a bit of luck to the game, I feel like you can mitigate it without too much effort. You really need to work together to win this and I've been only able to win it once. My two biggest complaints about the game is the rulebook the likelyhood of it being to similar each time. The rulebook is too all over the place when referencing rules and some key rules are not highlighted at all. The game also feels pretty similar each time, but I suppose most co-ops do as well.

TRY Dec/05: Got to play this game with 2 others, and enjoyed the thematic gameplay, unfolding story of the fellowship, and the AWESOME artwork.  Felt a LOT like an RPG to me, with a party of individual adventurers and the same main shared objective.  Frodo & Pippin didn't make it out of Shelob's Lair, and Sam got caught early into Mordor, but it was still good fun.

A good cooperative game but suffers heavily from leader syndrome where everyone is directed by the alpha player. 

Edit: (1-1-2013) From 9 to 8.  I acknowledge there are better cooperatives out there, but this was one of my first and it still retains high marks for this status.

Edit: (12-24-2013) Not so sure there are better cooperatives out there in point of fact.  This game seems to hold up better long term.  True co-ops are a weird thing.

I enjoy this coop quite a bit, perhaps mostly for theme. The first few games we played with a couple rules wrong that made the game much more difficult than it needed to be: we missed that the new ringbearer gets to draw 2 cards after each board, and we started the track markers *before* the blank spaces rather than *on* them. Whoops. 

I definitely like adding the Friends & Foes expansion.

I first learned of this game in my Game Design class in college. The report intrigued me so much that I searched for a copy. This was actually my very first board game that was not "main stream" game. I love the mechanic and the co-op element of the game. I have yet to beat the game on the hardest difficulty.

We have only played this game a few times as a 2 player game.  It is fun, but hard.  So far, we have died pitifully along the way and have not beaten the game.  This, of course, makes us want to play it more to beat it!

It takes awhile to get through the book of rules and do the initial game set-up.  You do learn the game play very quickly though.  The 2nd game goes much faster as does the set-up.  I like the cooperative elements of it and have always been a Tolkien fan. So, it appeals to me on different levels.

RATING: 10
(25+ plays)

Who can play?  Strategy game for 2-5 players.

This is a game of risk management at heart. This is the best cooperative game I have, but it takes patience and some real Middle Earth nerds to enjoy it.  It's one of those games that you don't really know what you're supposed to do until you've played it a few times.  We almost never win the game, but that's OK.  It's about the journey, not the destination.

The Friends and Foes expansion is absolutely necessary, and this high rating depends on it.

I usually play this one solitaire and enjoy it a lot.  I find it has a very high replayability, because I always feel like I could do better.  It's very rarely an "easy" victory.  Still playing around with Friends & Foes, though I don't have the hang of it yet.  Though I feel as if "my" strategy is better than my fellow players, it's important NOT to boss people around, or else this game turns into a self-indulgent mess.  Plus, it's fun to see less-experienced players pick up the strategy as the game goes on.

Finally got to play this!  Nice, involved cooperative.  Denser than Pandemic, without the traitor factor of Shadows over Camelot or Battlestar Galactica.  I suspect it evolved out of Knizia's intensely narrative Beowulf, itself an iteration of Taj Mahal's "tour" concept.

It's a co-op game that is a bit mechanical, as if the game were on rails. But I'm a sucker for LOTR themes and it provides this great sense of desperation(something always good for co-op). Battlestar Galactica and Pandemic offer more freedom to determine the outcome, but this ain't bad at all for a co-op game. But only for fans.

RATING: 9
Amazingly fun and simple cooperative game. I have played a number of more recent coops, but this one is really good. It does convey well the feeling of the little hobbits running around trying to get rid of the one ring. It is challenging yet not impossible. It takes little time to understand how to play it, and the rules are very straight forward. I can't wait to play the expansions I got, but I want to give it a couple tries on its base form before I move onto the extra stuff. Great game, and definitely a keeper.

This game was truly different than anything I had played before.  After repeated plays it is still very tense and difficult to beat the game.  Requires a lot of table talk, teamwork, and luck.  Very fun.

-update, after several more plays the game started to feel "solved" and the players beat the game pretty easily.  I traded it away.

I'm on a theme/rpg kick these days, and after reading so many good reviews for this game I had to buy it.  Generally, I like the scripted aspect to it, because really, you're playing the stories through.  The main difference is that in the stories everyone wins.  In this game, its very easy to lose.  If dumb luck doesn't get you, dumb choices will.

When do I play this?:
This is the kind of game that gets played on request.  It's appeal is in the fact that everyone must work together, and in the past, great events have taken place.. the last game we played resulted in a win after throwing the dice and seeing the only result that would win it - a blank. Yeah, it usually all comes down to a dice roll, but remember - the fun is in the journey! Events like that bring people together and increase the chance this game will be played again and again.

Good co-operative game, but as with any co-operative, you have to be concious of letting everyone have a say.  There are some quirky rules that don't make any sense (like: "you may tell others what cards you have, but you cannot SHOW them".  Why in the world would I lie about my cards?  We're all on the same team, so why is this rule even in there?), but if everyone involved is actively thinking through the game it can be a lot of fun.

Played this game twice, once as 2 player and once as 4 player (person who owned the game had more cards), and while it was okay, I didn't really enjoy it.  The scenarios felt too scripted, there was never really any big threat that got on the board that we felt we would have problems beating, and player powers were just okay.  For me, it's meh.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What's most important in a coop game? Narrative, theme, tension? Team play, or to be equally playable with two as with five players?

Probably, and that must mean Lord of the Rings is the perfect coop game. You really feel a sense of accomplishment when the players reach Mordor, you'll willingly sacrifice yourself to make that happen, and you'll fear the Evil White Die. You will also immediately want to play again, win or lose. 

So why am I not rating it higher than a 7? It's certainly not because of any flaws in the game; LotR is as brilliantly designed as you would expect from Knizia. It is, however, a cooperative game, and a really linear one at that. When I play a game, I want the freedom to make grand plans and clever moves that take my opponents by surprise. I want an evolving game board, conflict and chaos.

LotR gets repetitive, fast. Perhaps playing with the expansions changes that. I'm glad I own the game, it's nice to play once in a while, but normally I'd much rather play other games. And if I do feel like playing a cooperative fantasy game, there's always Dungeons & Dragons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've enjoyed most of the books, the movies and being a fan of Knizia I was hoping for very good things: alas I have tried numerous times and I just can't "get into" the game (despite the beautiful production). I think this is due to 2 reasons: firstly, I find that the mechanics to the play too distracting to get into the theme.

And theme is the other obstacle: it is too rich  in that some of the unrelatable elements just become symbols and hand management issues. The linear feel doesn't help either, when War of the Ring portrays the hobbits journey (in the midst of warfare) in 2 dimensions which helps portray the story better. To better illustrate the issue of theme density, I love Knizia's Confrontation as the spacial movement and combat effects provide a more relatable theme so simply.

At least the design re-invigorated the co-operative genre, especially with the inspired rule of not showing your hand contents. In fact another good co-op (Pandemic) when played with the aforementioned rule sealed LotRs fate.

In summary, I feel this is for the fans who would love the semi-scripted and very rich narrative to relive the epic again (and again).

RATING: 5

I have to admint: I'm not a fan of cooperative games. Playing this, I felt no tension or having to make any tough decisions. It felt scripted and predictable. It felt like often you just do what the game tells you to do.  Things like: Everybody discard two cards; or the players collectively have to discard some shields or round tokens. I guess those who are into the books and get into the theme as they play can have a lot of fun, but for me theme is secondary. I felt the same way about Shadows Over Camelot.

This is a mixed bag.  The boards are beautiful; the systems are unique.  What is lacking is a game. I have played several times and feel the systems lacks a purpose.  One poor game of Puerto Rico, El Grande or PoF has more opportunity for decision making than this entire game.  It is too bad because it is obvious that a tremendous amount of effort went into it's construction but it simply doesn't work.  The worst thing to be said of any game is that it is dull.  I regret to say LotR is dull.

This game starts out a headful but eventually tapers down into some kind of mental understanding.  Although the game is fairly abstract, the feeling of the books definatly comes through.  If you've made it through successfully, you're most likely tired, worn, and a hair away from all being lost.  After Lothlorien, you basically just get weaker and weaker, with the goal trying to be to make it to the end before loosing the ring to the enemy all together.  When this game is won, people rarely cheer, they usually sigh with relief.  Yet, somehow, most players come back for more punishment next time (O: Very well done.

A co-operative game for 3-5 players. Each player represents a Hobbit and the game traces Frodo's journey in LOTR from Bag End to Mount Doom in his quest to destroy the One Ring. Some luck, hand management, cooperative planning, and foresight form the key game mechanics.

Just as in the books, the odds are stacked heavily against the players. Winning is going to be rare, but that is what makes the game memorable, and a victory doubly so. Most times, you will feel that you are confronting impossible odds, just as the Fellowship felt.

LOTR is unlikely to be enjoyed by those who have never read the books or seen the movies. While the game can feel repetitive if played multiple times within a short time span, as long as you let a few weeks pass between consecutive games, LOTR is an enjoyable game.

A strange game.. very abstract, sometimes seems heavy lucky-based, sometimes seems there are not so many choices during play. I don't like the discard mechanic.

Edit: After a few years, I really don't care much for it. It's too dry, the theme seems pasted on top of the mechanic. You don't really feel like having an adventure, and that has finally made me stop liking it. It's lost its appeal almost completely. I will sell it/trade it the first chance I get.

13/01/2008: This really felt like a resource management game, where players had to decide which resources to sacrifice at every turn.

My own vision of Tolkien's opus is way more gritty and darker than this game. That being said, I also dislike the game in here, it kind of plays itself, there is minimum strategy and too much luck, as compared to the similar competitive Beowulf.

RATING: 6.5
First impressions after a two player game: Takes some time to get into. Neither of us had played the game before. After the first scenario we got the hang of things and made our way across the scenarios. 

We went into Mordor loaded with cards in hand and all five Gandalf cards unused, with quite some distance between ourselves and Sauron. Then bad luck struck and in three turns we were down to the last event where Sauron gets the One ring and wins.
So we lost. 

Personally I don't feel the theme as much. The life token requirement feels rather disconnected from the story, though I understand its function. The feeling opression aspect does come across well. Especially with more than three as it will be a lot harder to stave off corruption. The fact that our previous good play was undone by some rotten luck does sting a bit.
Still, we did have fun and will probably play this again. Maybe with the first expansion added.

There are some really bad translation errors in the Dutch version.

one of the first coops and my first solo run of it: I hated it because it is a bit abstract.  But after a friend told me about his experience with it: i took another look.  It's a fine game.  I probably enjoy playing it solo more than getting someone else into it, but that still says alot

This game was where the "rebirth" of Tolkein-themed board games began.  It took me by surprise, because it was unlike any game I had ever played before.  The cooperative aspects are great for playing with friends, but there is a tendency for the one most familiar or "into" the game (i.e. me) to "take charge", which can lessen the contribution of some, or at least leave them asking "What should I do now?".  The game is beautiful (beautiful art on the cards and on the boards), which makes it even more enjoyable to play (although the icons are horribly drawn and seem out of place with the rest of the great art).  It does follow the books and not the movie (another plus).  My main gripe is it's almost TOO abstract for my tastes.  It's actually sort of like a mathematical puzzle with a Lord of the Rings theme pasted onto it.  So sometimes I have to struggle to keep the theme alive when I'm deciding how many "life tokens" I should discard or whether I should move on the "feet" line or the "tree" line. Now that other LoTR boardgames have come out that I like a bit better (mainly the confrontation and WoTR), this isn't my top choice.  But it's still one of the better tolkein games out there.

Hmmm, reading everything above, alot of people play and like this game.  I've tried it once, and i just really couldn't get into it, or figure it out for that matter.  I've played many a game, from Squad Leader to Settlers, but for some reason, none of what we were doing made any sense to me.

This is an excellent game! One of the most appealing aspects is the fact that all of the players work together as a team. There are no hard feelings at the end of the game regardless of the outcome.

Played once 2 player. 

A very interesting game. I like how you can choose which path to take as to what you need. Sometimes it is better just to speed through the main track, other times you need to get the life tokens. It seemed fairly easy to win, but I can see that it would be harder in a multiplayer game, as you would have fewer turns to get what you needed.

I'll probably try this again at a later point, and definately with more people. Maybe an expansion, too.

Loved the books, thought the movies were pretty good (where they actually followed the plot of the books), but once again I'm disappointed by a game based on the books (that makes three so far).  This particular one was ok in the cooperation aspect, and well balanced in the tightness of resources required to reach the goal, but ultimately the players spent more time adding up shield points, figuring whether to draw or play cards based on which cards were needed in which track, and so on, than they did engrossed in the STORY LINE.  I never 'felt' like I escaped from a balrog, resisted corruption, befriended an ent, defeated a warg army, and destroyed an evil artifact - I felt like I played enough two-feet cards, star-cards, hand-cards, and sword-cards to cover the necessary card counts as they came up.  This game thus has the exact same drawbacks as the game of Beowulf, detracting just enough from its good features to make me wonder if I really want to play it a second time.  I suppose I will, some time. (Oh, and the artwork was nowhere near what I'd like to see in a game based on the books, just my opinion.) Update: It was more fun the second time, because the end was much tighter (lost by one die roll), but still has all the flaws I mentioned earlier.

From Peter after he got another copy with all the supplements.  Played one solo game - be interesting to see who goes for this one.

Won one and lost one of the standard game.  Even if it is a little gamey, enough of the theme comes through to make this an intense and enjoyable co-op game.

Update:  Back to Peter for his rental business.

Perhaps not brimming with replayability, but its nice to break out every once in a while.  I find the difficulty level really depends on the luck of the tile drawing.  Sometimes its impossible, others its way too easy.  But I think it has a good thematic feel of trying to keep corruption at bay and going on a long journey.

this game is a puzzle to me. I can play it. I understand the mechanics but with all the chrome it feels like there should be more game there. It feels like cotton candy to me. Maybe it gets better with the expansions. The cards are essentially like money and the decisions are as about as interesting as paying the bills. I give it a begrudging 5 only because of the production values and the art work and that it's a co-op.

RATING: 7
It's about the journey rather than the game. However I somehow subconciously enjoy Sauron taking the Hobbits down - is it because I don't like cooperative games or I just want the game to finish early? Knizia is always going to give you something to think about, but I've played it with young players (8) and older players and they've all wondered if the tactical decisions are invalid and it's all down to luck. It is quick though, and very different, and that's a big plus.

This was one of my original coop games that really turned me onto cooperative style games.  The game itself is a bit abstract, which made it too much for my kids to enjoy (who love the LoTR movies).  Now that there are so many other coop game out there, this one gets passed over almost all the time now.

This is a nice variation to playing all those against-each-other -games. No backstabbing etc, but facing the dangers with an unified group. IMO requires a bit of roleplaying and not thinking of all the game mechanics with an analytical mind. I enjoyed this very much.

Knizia's entry to the LOTR saga. Good co-operative game where all players play as one of the hobbits of the Fellowship against the game system. The Fellowship travels on various boards containing events and places from the books. Teamplay is essential destination of course being Mordor. Gameplay is mostly based on several different decks of cards. LOTR has interesting mechanics, which suffer a bit from large amount of rules in the beginning. Especially when you're playing with the expansions, which I prefer because they add a lot to the game tactically. As standalone game I do not rate this that high.

The quality of the pieces kills the theme for me. Sauron is a paperweight, the hobbits are bright plastic pieces. The cards are simple drawings of feet and hands. Yet the game costs as much as a DoW game.

It can be a good game possibly, but I need to find the right people for it.

An excellent cooperative game for 2 to 5 players. You don't compete to win; you all work together to destroy the ring and "beat" the game itself.

I know the complaints ... "it's group solitaire", "the game plays you instead of the other way around", etc. But the games extraordinary success is in capturing the very feeling of being a member of a desperate fellowship, wanting success for the group yet still hopefully survival for the self. For someone who hadn't read the books, Reiner sure nailed this theme.

RATING: 9
This cooperative adventure game manages to feel epic without requiring hours out of your day.  As a standalone, the game is enjoyable, but truly feels complete when combined with the Friends & Foes expansion.  F&F removes the "on-rails" concerns by offering more tactical choices and greatly increases the pacing by adding a gentler scenario at the beginning of the game.

I really wanted to like this game, but I can see no point to the co-operation.  The game is really a solitaire game, spread thinly among more players.  Maybe if there was more restriction on player communication?  The theme mainly appears in the events and really does feel weak - putting the action on a map of middle earth would have really helped.  I commend Reiner and Kosmos on the concept and effort, but for me it didn&#039;t work.

Replay value drops steeply after you figure out how to win.  Even if you play well, bad luck can destroy you.  I don't mind the cooperative aspects of the 'game'.  I've bumped my rating up a couple of points for origionality and because the first couple times you play it is fun trying to figure out how to win.
EDIT: Replayed this after X-mas and still enjoyed it.  Bumped my rating up a bit.
EDIT: We played it again X-mas 2012 and still enjoyed it.  It seems to be becoming not a regular game, but an occasional treat.

Any game that offers a co-operative mechanism is either gonna bomb or shine as I see it.  At first I thought this was a bomb, until my wife and I lost on the last game board!  The math behind this is brillent and it makes it a true contest of working together around a wonderfully made board & bits.  This would be a great game to bring non-gamers into, especially if they like LotR, but even those who dont care about the theme will have a good time.  I look forward to playing with a bigger group!  Definately Recomended! :)

For any fan of the novels, this game is a great experience.  Although the shine wears off some after each play, just opening the box and thinking about the adventures we've had makes me want to play it again.  I recently played a few more games after a hiatus and thought about upping my rating.  Definitely a great system that I see myself revisiting a couple of times a year -- fun game.

RATING: 8.5
I like coops and even though this is one of the oldest (or the oldest), I like it more than most others. Even though gameplay is pretty abstract, somehow I get immersed in the struggle of the fellowship of the ring: Being in Moria and one bad event after another pops up or having no cards left and you have to get through Mordor, but you still manage to get to Mount Doom, is very rewarding. 

About the expansions: 
I do not like friend and foes (since it basically boils down to eliminating all foes, which is absolutely unthematic). 
Sauron is take-it-or-leave-it, depending if you like to have one player being the antagonist. 
Battlefields is a really excellent expansion. If you have seen enough of the base game, this is the expansion to throw in. Again, the battlefields are completely abstract, but still you get thematically immersed in fending the foes off (yes, it is rather fending off than beating them, which is the reason for it being thematic).

May be my favorite game of all time.  Knizia plus co-op plus Lord of the Rings= sensational.  It's his best-selling game for a reason.  I don't understand the Knizia haters- he comes out with one amazing game after another and you don't like him.

RATING: 9
I'm amazed at how well this game evokes the impressions and feelings that readers of the book get.  Struggling together against darkness, sacrificing here and there for the good, hoping events don't race faster than you, making timely decisions that are very difficult... the theme is not 'pasted on' as with other Knizia games -- it's in your face.  Rolling the die is something you dread -- even on the tenth, or twentieth time playing the game.  Sauron's just a little black piece when you set up the game, but an ominous specter when you're actually playing.  The co-operative aspect inspires my wife, and this never hits the table to protest.  Recommended.

I am gutted to see that this game has an average rating of 6.8. Although this is not the best game I have played, it is for sure the game I have played the most. 

What this game makes it so great is that it's a cooperative game you play with two players (without additional two-player-rules) or up to five players. The cooperative element of the game is done nicely and everybody has a special role in the game.

When friends come over that are not very experienced in playing board games, this is the game to buy. Instead of defeating an disadvantaged player you can help each other and try to defeat Sauron (the board). 

My experience is that people who don't like board games seam to have changed there minds when they have played this game. It is so different to most other games where sometimes the evening ends with fights or endless discussion about the rules. When playing as a team with the same goal, fights are unlikely, and for some reason you always concur with each others interpretation of the rules.

I believe this is the first co-operative game. It shows. Everything you love in Pandemic is here, its tied to a really pretty theme but the timers feel a little clumsy, the victory goals a little unthematic. Essentially you play cards to advance on different tracks, they get you protection against the corrupting effect of the ring or other cards. All the time the events you face are getting worse and you are gradually being corrupted and risk falling into Sauron's hands.
Its quite fun but a little bit fiddly and I wouldn't play it over a modern co-operative.

Playing it for the first time, my hard-core gamer friend and I really enjoyed this game.  We're competitive guys who brutalize each other in Settlers of Catan and similar games, so this was a big change of pace for us.  I'm giving this game an 8, because of the high-quality components, stunning artwork, refreshing cooperative gameplay, and interesting strategy.  Rules were a bit confusing at first, and we made some mistakes, which we realized half-way through.  Now that we get it, however, and the long-term goals better understood, it's something we'll be playing a lot.

(07/22/08) - After playing a single game up at Crossroad Games I felt I needed another co-op game in my collection.

(9/2/08) - [8] - Initially I wasn't sure if I would like this game or not. I had heard it was heavily abstracted (I mean you move a bunch of cones, after all). While the game is abstracted out and the only narrative you get is if you read the event titles, this is still a ton of fun to play. You rarely win, and when you do it feels like a real accomplishment.

SOLD (04/14/2017) - It has been many years since Lord of the Rings has hit the table. I think that if it were released today, it would not be received well due to the level of abstraction. I still enjoyed the many games of it I played.

So this was my first REAL game that I purchased (after Dangerous Book for Boys game). Bought it through BGG for a song (OK, I didn't really sing, it was like $15... because it was in GERMAN and I did not read/write/speak one word of German). It took a while but I finally figured this game out (w/BGG's help) and was instantly hooked on coop-style games. Helps that I love the books (movies... mixed feelings... definitely worth seeing and I've watched them more than once and will watch again... but given that I read the books when I was transitioning from high school to college, that experience was as much about me growing up (OK, starting to). Also because a very cute girl in high school was the one who encouraged me to read the books. I read the books but completely missed the other message she was trying to telegraph to me... man, what a LOSER!)... but back to the BOARD game. Yeah, it's great and a must-have for anyone caught up in LoTR lore.

For me, this is a very good cooperative game, and very difficult to win.  Devir´s edition is beautiful, and very cheap for all the material inside the box. Maybe it isn´t very thematic (it´s more an abstract game), but I like Reiner Knizia´s idea in this one.

Good for what it is: a Knizia-designed Euro game.  That said, I am much more aware of the mechanic than the theme when I play this.  We really feel like we are playing against a game system as opposed to journeying through Middle Earth.  Winning will be a matter of playing enough times that you can figure out the game system.

Not sure what to think after one play. I'm not one for co-op games, but this game seemed to work well since your hands are hidden. You really have to speak with everyone to find out what the best thing to do is rather than one person looking everything over and telling everyone the best thing.

It's rated 7 because that's about my average rating for a game. After another play or two it could really go either way. But I think the game is challenging enough for new players that there's a lot of replay value.

For the record, we lost our first game. 4 players. We got to the end with one player alive and came decently close to winning.

RATING: 8
I've grown to enjoy this game more over time. I see no reason to consider trading it away and think there is a lot to explore with just the base game. I haven't touched the expansions yet.

[b]Things I Like[/b]
:d10-1: The Tolkien/Lord of the Rings theme is done very well for what I've heard some people describe as an abstract game. I consider this game very thematic, almost dripping with theme. I appreciate the John Howe art.
:d10-2: The challenge options. The difficulty of the game is easily adjusted with the starting space of Sauron. This idea is great and is implemented very well. Everything plays the same, you simple adjust the starting "pressure" on your hobbits. New players can start off easy to get farther and become more familiar with the game. When you think you've got things figured out, just start Sauron a little closer and see how you feel.
:d10-3: The randomness present is enough to keep this game feeling "new" each time. You can't just decide to rush the main track each time and expect to win. While the challenges and resources are all the same game to game, they implement themselves in different orders and configurations each time. This keeps the challenge from getting stale.
:d10-4: Playable co-op 2-5 or solitaire with 1-5 hobbits. Speaking of challenges, they change based on the number of players. A smaller number of players results in less card availability but often having an abundance of green tokens. More players result in more cards but never enough green tokens to go around.
:d10-5: The Sauron token. I mean it's got it's own symbol here on BGG. :sauron:
:d10-6: The game rewards thoughtful planning & consideration of risk. You must carefully expend your limited resources to accomplish the quest without spending them too fast or too slowly.

[b]Neutral Comments[/b]
:d10-1: This seems to be a game that gets a lot of fringe opinions. People tend to either love it or hate it. I love it. I think many people stay away or don't like it because of its theme (can't help that), art (icons could be better, I think), or challenge.
:d10-2: Streaks of bad tile draws over a couple scenario boards will sometimes, I believe, doom you to failure no matter how well you play. I think this is rare but possible.  
:d10-3: Can be prone to an assertive personality taking charge and bossing the other players. The most experienced person should try to avoid bossing or influencing players.

[b]Summary[/b]
I really enjoy this. This will probably be received well by most Tolkien fans, abstract fans, and people who like a slower pace and careful deliberation. This is not a game suited for players who like fast, easy gameplay. Also, it's not a party game. Can be a good husband/wife game or a good game to play with children who can understand the rules and strategy.

This was such a disappointment.  Lord of the Rings has beautiful game boards. The boards progessively follow the story, which is nice, but the game play is dry, repetitive, and tedious. It is also one of the least truly cooperative "cooperative" games I've played, in that a bare minimum of interaction or group decisions are necessary.  This is only my opinion, of course. It may fit someone else's ideal perfectly.

Excellent cooperative game, especially if you have a group that enjoys the theme.  It really needs the "Friends and Foes" expansion to shine, and I enjoy the "Sauron" expansion as well.

LOTR is very pretty and well made. It is a good effort to make a cooperative game. My only negative considerations are the candy-land-like feel of traveling a predetermined path and the way luck plays a role in the game. Too much luck involved.

RATING: 10

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It captures a lot of the themes of LotR very well, but it also feels kind of mesozoic when compared to other cooperative games. It's somehow random without feeling dynamic. Like Frodo's journey to Mordor, this could be kind of a slog in the wrong circumstances. But as a design to step back and observe, I do admire it.

*edit* I recently traded for a new copy and have been playing some two-player games solo. It's got a lot more staying power than I originally thought, and the themes of the novel (if not the actual story beats) still ring clearly in the design. This is probably one of Knizia's best games, and I hope FFG reprints the expansions for their nice new edition.

*edit* After a few years with this game I am far more impressed by it than I was at the beginning. This is probably the best implementation of Tolkien's original story that we've seen in a board game. While a lot of it remains quite abstracted, it draws on the themes of friendship, sacrifice, and holding out against encroaching darkness so well that the feel is perfect. And lest we forget, the novel is about a journey, not a war. This game captures that perfectly, and it's a definite classic.

:d6-1: a version compatible with expansions, some aren't I think. The fact that, I think this has a strong narrative, is why I'm interested. Plays well with two as well. I'd put it as a weak 3 for solo, though. It's hard to know whether to leave the wish list levels where they are at, for two player, or solo.  It's because I see this one pop up alot in the local math trade, so I know it'll be easy to get, probably.  I'll speak out the most obvious differences here, and put my overarching considerations in the wishlist geeklist. Makes it hard for you, but as a whole, I can't remember how much I want it relative to the other games on my wishlist, if I use a different method for numbering it. Prioritizing it.  My ocd is likely rearing it's head here.

There are only a couple cases where the number differs that much.

My wife likes this game and plays it solo when she is bored. It leaves me a little cold. It feels like someone took a different game and tacked a Lord of the Rings theme onto it. The hearts, shields, and rings just don't have much of a thematic vibe for me.

I was a Tolkien-inspired youth, and I still love the series. I don't remember any heart, shield, or ring tokens from the books.

On the other hand, the little Sauron piece is cool.

This is an original and engaging game that is too often maligned because of the unusual mechanics. Obviously, cooperative games are different than traditional games -- this doesn't mean you should dismiss them on principle. I have played this game many times with groups of 3-5 and every session has been great fun. There is lots of interaction with the other players as you develop a strategy for clearing each board. The best part is, beating the game is hard and feels like a real accomplishment. When you do beat it everybody wins!

And here it is! the game which introduced me to modern boardgames in the flesh! Treasure my copy from 15 years ago, with all of the expansions of course (though I don't play the Sauron version--then it wouldn't be co-op). So epic, I love how hard it is. I think I've won twice in 15 years!

I had one lovely game with me and three of my brothers, where we made it all the way to mount doom, and one of my younger brothers, as he held the dice to dunk the ring, got an evil smile and said "this would make me quite powerful, wouldn't it...? Why would I destroy such an artifact? We could USE it! Then he ran from the room with it, cackling like a madman. Love that guy. That's why we've won twice and not three times.

of course, we always play with all of the expansions, and at a high difficulty. is there any other way to play?

I've only played this with the battlefields and friends and foes expansion. Love the theme and components but the game feels to linear to me (capturing the spirt of Frodo's long journey but not making that interesting a game). Don't think this stands up to somke of the other co-op games on the market.

Also feel the friends and foes expansion doesn't add anything to the game.

Thoroughly enjoyed this game when I first got it. Beautiful art, good game flow, challenging and fun. I've kept track of the score for every game I've played on my set. The best we've ever done is a score of 84 on 01/01/03, though that was with Sauron starting at 15.

One day on a family vacation my brother and I played with just Frodo and Sam. That is really tough - it took us about five tries to finally get to the end and cast the ring into Mount Doom.

Les jeux coopératifs ne sont pas légion, et celui ci est sans doute le tout meilleur du genre. Du hasard (mais il faut bien renouveler les parties), une difficulté réellement présente et parfaitement calibrée… Le jeu semble insurmontable aux premières parties, puis, au fur et à mesure que l'on commence à maitriser le parcours de nos valeureux hobbits, cela devient de plus en plus facile. Il est alors temps d'augmenter le niveau de difficulté, soit en faisant démarrer Sauron plus loin, soit en acquérant une des trois extensions, qui viennent encore enrichir le jeu.

La thème est parfaitement rendu, même s'il est plus facile de penser en termes de cases et de cartes qu'en cachettes et progression. Mais il faut bien que cela reste un jeu, et pas un livre. Une totale réussite.

I remember looking at this when it came out, being impressed by the weight of the box, then very disappointed on looking at the back to see that it was some kind of abstract game and nothing like Talisman. Picked it up for £1 in a charity shop - now I see what all the fuss is about. Great game.

Must give it another try, so far I don't see that much strategy, only short time tactical decisions.
Luck of the draw has a huge impact on the outcome of the adventures. Definitely more interesting and

best way to work around issues you have to deal with at a certain time. As I said.... must give it another try.

Not much of a game here if you're not a Lord of the Rings fan. If you're playing Sauron then you'll want to stock up on cards of a certain type to make a run at one of the victory conditions. Basic hand management stuff. The bad guys don't seem to have much of a chance of carrying out their vandalism to the end. I hate hobbits - they're boring becuase all they do is eat, eat, eat and sing silly songs. It appears that their size is matched by their interllect. It'll be better for all if the cool eye guy kills 'em off quick. Their's is oboviously a doomed race. I mean, when was the last time you ever saw a hobbit, or even a hungary stupid one.

It's ok, a cooperative board game where everyone offers suggestions on how to play your hand. So whoever has the loudest voice is essentially playing the game solitaire and you're watching. But this sounds more like a personal problem, doesn't it? Anyhow, I thought this game was on the boring side. This might be a bias on my part against cooperative board games, but I doubt it. This game needs to give the individual more power, and prevent players from discussing strategy with each other except at certain points. Otherwise meek players aren't playing, they're being told what to do. Perhaps I'm being too harsh and not getting into the spirit of the game. If so, rating may go up after another playing.

As far as co-op games go, this is the best I have run into (I've only played Pandemic once and I liked it a lot, but it'll need more plays before it unseats LotR). Frustratingly difficult, but in the way that makes you immediately want to try again.

Perfect.  Even knowing how to "solve" the puzzle doesn't seem to detract from the experience.  Always produces great "anecdote moments" which is one of my criteria for greatness.
[2010 revisit]Finally dropped this from 10.  Not because it isn't still perfect, but because I simply don't play it enough now to justify that rating.

Great game with a great theme that actually works with the abstract mechanics. Once you figure out how to beat it, it loses a bit of replay. Playing with fewer players, or the expansions should liven it up again however. Recommended.

RATING: 4
I really did not like this game. My biggest problem with the game is just how dry and themeless it is. Matching symbols to move along a track does not convey any sort of narrative arc or excitement. Sneaking through the mines of moria is the same as fighting orcs at Helms Deep, except the needed symbol is different. The lack of a solid narrative or feeling of actually doing anything took all of the excitement out of the game, but left all of the frustration. I really have to wonder how replayable this game would be over the long haul as well. However, that is mostly a rhetorical question because I have little desire to play this again.

I've only played this game once, but on the strength of that one play I immediately purchased my own copy.  A delightful game that fills a niche quite nicely - that of co-operative play.  Everyone is working towards a single objective, to destroy the ring and beat the game system.I do not own the Sauron expansion - I wanted to preserve the co-operative nature of the game.  There are thousands of competitive games out there, and only a small handful like this.  A gem.

RATING: 7
Fun cooperative game, would be better if played with some variant or optional rule where one player actually wins. There's one in the rules where the player with the most sheilds wins (unless the group loses).

I think Shadows over Camelot will outshine this due to the traitor mechanic.

RATING: 6
It's a great game. I might even go as far as to call it ingenious. I just don't feel like playing it anymore, nor do I feel like buying expansions for it.

Maybe I have a problem with how the randomization works. It feels like the "drawing menacing chits" mechanic rarely produces interesting problems for the players to overcome. It just either fucks you in the ass or it doesn't.

I have very mixed feelings about this game. It IS beautifully presented - no doubt about it. It IS a very clever idea - and I really like the cooperative gameplay. But I REALLY hate the amount of lunk needed to win ! It comes down to that pretty much. You can&#039;t really think your way out - you only negotiate who gets it in the neck each turn - until necks run out. I still kinda enjoy playing - but it just frustrates me sooooo much !

We mostly played this two player, although we did get the opportunity to play with four one time. If we acquired it today I suspect it might enjoy a longer residency with us, but we went through a massive de-cluttering two house moves ago and this game hadn't captured our imagination enough to justify keeping it.

German version.

A coop game with an excellent game system (a knizia game !).
When you play, you feel like the fellowship in the book : the begining is easy (like a walk in a garden), but when you approach of the end, Sauron is more present.  
A difficult game (not to understand, but to win), but it's not a problem.  When you succed to destroy the ring, you are very happy ;-)

RATING: 7.5
I quite like this game.  I've played solitaire boardgames for years, but oddly enough didn't pick this up until Christmas, 2010.  The components in the Silver Line edition are excellent and there's a lot of game in this compact box.  

It's true that it has a Knizia "feel" to it - the heart of the design is an abstract card draw & play mechanic that doesn't have anything to do with the LOTR.  But on the other hand, as events are drawn and you progress through the game, you definitely are creating a narrative for your characters.  

Just the right amount of challenge.  I tend to lose more often than I win, but I like it that way and it's usually pretty close. I worry about re-playability.  Possibly a game I will pull off the shelf every few months for a go.

UPDATE:  I pull this out a couple times a year and still like it.  But it doesn't get more playtime than that.

Juego cooperativo. No me gusta. Por mi le daria un 3 o 4 de puntuacion, pero le doy un 5 porque a mi mujer y amigos si les ha gustado y eso tambien lo valoro.

I have the much maligned FF silver line edition, and though I'd very much like the full-sized boards found in the Hasbro edition, I'm not terribly fussed. I really quite like this early co-operative game. Surprisingly thematic -- at least in 'feel,' if not mechanisms, and John Howe's iconic artwork helps matters considerably. As in most Knizia offerings, the mechanisms are elegant and flow quite well. At it's core, LOTR is a hand management game where you're simply moving up different tracks, but the often punishing nature of the events (a string of bad things followed by temporary relief) replicates the 'hanging by the skin of your teeth' feel of the LOTR.

Beautiful looking game. The first couple of games that I played were exciting, despite the tendency of more experienced players to coach the newer players on every turn. After that, it became obvious that this game follows a fairly limited script, like "watching" The Rocky Horror Picture Show with serious fans. Only the randomness of the cards kept each game from feeling identical.

RATING: 10
Really quite interesting from a design perspective. Not only is the integration with theme the best I've seen from RK, but the way the game is balanced is just masterful. If it were simply as matter of clever design, however, this game wouldn't garner such a high rating from me.

The key words here are tense and fun. LotR is the kind of game that encourages great table talk, largely due to the way the game is integrated with the theme, but also because it is so cooperative and so tense.

I am concerned that, at some point in the future, the decision making algorithm for players will become transparent, robbing the game of its ability to create interesting choices for players. But thus far, that hasn't been that big of a problem. Even if you are making "optimal" decisions as a team, the level of randomness still manages to inject an exciting level of tension and surprises do occur.

I will play this game pretty much any time. Although I thrive on competitive games (even though I am not competitive - I'm equally happy to lose, I just happen to like competitive game designs), I enjoy the change of pace and the feeling of cameradrie created by LotR. This could be a 10, but I'm still worried about replayability. I'll just have to wait and see.

Update: Definitely worthy of at least a 9. This game is just peachy. Further Update: After a dozen plays  plays, I can vouch for the replayability here. Lord of the Rings is just an excellent cooperative game. I suppose, with boorish gamers, there is the risk of someone attempting to "quarterback" the game and pushing for particular decisions, but we haven't had this problem. We all enjoy a little huddle where-in the pros and cons of a decision are discussed, and then it is up to the *player* to actually make the decision. Excellent, excellent game - we always play with the Friends and Foes expansion.

RATING: 7
Great artwork, great gameplay.  I always enjoy when this comes to the table. The sense of each player sacrificing to achieve the common goal is consistent with the LotR theme and forces a lot of tough group decision making and, from my experience, helps avoid the leader issue common in co-ops. 

The game loses replay value, though, when you've played the game enough to learn what cards need to be stockpiled for future scenarios. At that point, it becomes a matter of making sure everyone is prepared for what you know is coming - and this is very INconsistent with the LotR theme.  At that point, the game boils down to hoping you don't get on a nasty run of event tiles in each scenario.

RATING: N/A
I like this game for the theme and probably from nostalgia since it was my first board game to reach beyond the old standards like Monopoly.

The actual gameplay is VERY random based on drawing from a bag.  As you are going through the game, one draw at specific points in the game can change it from an easy victory to utter defeat.  For whatever reason I love trying to complete the quest and working together, but how to win is pretty straight forward after playing a couple times.  You will also have those unlucky games where you get destroyed because of bad luck with nothing you could do about it.  

If you like co-operative games and enjoy the LOTR story and world then this is something you can think about.  But for how long this game can take, the random draw factor, and the so-so mechanics I wouldn't suggest this to anyone else and would find something else.

You have to give credit for innovation on this game.  The cooperative nature of the game, playing against the Dark Lord, is great!  Game play is nail-biting and nerve-racking, especially in Mordor.    The more that I play this game, the more that I am impressed by the balance of the cards, mechanisms and abilities within the game.  For instance, with two players, keeping enough cards in your hand is difficult, but getting life tokens is easy.  With four players, there are usually enough cards to go around, but it is really tough to get all of the life tokens that you need.  Very few games have the tense moments that this game brings about.  The desparation attempts to keep the fellowship alive while crawling through Mordor do an excellent job of mirroring the atmosphere of the books.

While the game holds true to the series, this is both its flaw and its strength. Since the events occur in the same order as the movie, this makes it feel like you are almost playing the movie and that the game is playing you in a lot of ways. Still, it is a cooperative game with some critical choices that definitely can make or break the game and any fans of the series will surely love the artwork and thought that went into making this game. The lack of randomization does take away some replay value though.

This is definitely one of the best board games I've ever played! Highly recommend IF you can find an original year 2000 copy (Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast version). Trust me, the wooden and plastic components in the original version are far superior to the cardboard crap replacements in subsequent versions (FFG ruined this game!), and makes for more satisfying gameplay in my opinion. Also only the original version is compatible with the expansions. If you plan on hunting down the expansions, then you definitely want the original version of LOTR.

Very difficult game, so that's a plus (challenge is always a good thing, to me). However, I don't know if it's the style, or what, but for some reason I just can't get into this game.  I played it twice and I don't ever see my self going back to play it ever again.  Even though I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan, something about this game just isn't right to me.  I find myself not caring about the outcome of situations.  Win or lose, I just didn't care either way.  Can't like 'em all, I suppose.

Can't judge yet since I haven't played, but it seems after reading the rules that it's a lot or reaction without much "playing".EDIT: There does seem to be a fair amount of reacting, but there is a game in there too, and I enjoyed the cooperation. I also think it would be fun to play with a few other players who don't know anything about planning for future events (like myself).EDIT: I've played solo, and while it's okay and I did get a good tense feel on the 2nd board (lost on the 3rd), it's not something I'll do again. This game demands conversation/interaction to bring out the theme. Without this, it's just, "I'll discard a tree".

RATING: 8.5
I'm not a fan of abstract games. This game is abstract. I don't like high luck in games, and this is filled with luck. I really shouldn't like this game - it's Knizia, who's games are often way abstract, and I also don't like the artwork very much at all (sorry John Howe fans - I know he's considered one of the best). But...there is just something about this game that I love! Really, your just hoping to get the right cards at the right time, and if you don't, your screwed. So why do I like it so much? I don't know if I can put my finger on it. It flows along at a very nice pace, its incredibly foreboding and fun to watch Sauron come closer and closer to the hobbits  - and vice versa, the way each hobbit has to obtain rings and hearts and such is a nice mechanic, there are some rough choices to have to make - which is nice, and in the end, if you win it is truly a high-five slappin moment because lord knows you thought you were gonna lose for sure. Its one of those games where I truly understand why some people don't like it, but to me, it really brings players together in a true co-op feeling that you are all really working together toward a common goal. 

Here's what to do: on a stormy day, get together a few friends or perhaps just you and your lover,  bring up the lord of the rings soundtrack, put some logs on the fire, pull out this game, and have an awesome time.

I enjoyed this until we beat it.  I haven't had the urge to set it back up.  While there is some skill (dependent on experience) in deciding how to play the boards, the (bad)luck of the draw is often too much to overcome.  I will certainly play it in the future, and may revise my rating.

I respect this game for what it is, arguably the first modern co-op game ever made (and for many years, the only modern co-op game).  If I was into hobby board games back in the early 2000's, I don't know what I would have thought of the game.  I didn't play it until late 2014, where I can't help but compare it to newer titles such as Pandemic, Eldritch Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Mage Knight, etc.

At it's core, Lord of the Rings is a pretty straight-forward game: collect and use cards to advance up a track(s) to complete a conflict from the books (Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and finally Mordor) before the ring-bearer becomes completely corrupted.  

My major complaint with the game is how random the story tiles can be, and how there's little-to-no means to mitigate a bad string of event draws.  It's really frustrating to get 3 events in a row on the first player's turn, which unfortunately happens more often than it should for me.

Furthermore, the base game seems to have a dominant strategy to just burn through the main activity track as quickly as possible, in hopes that events won't trigger, which makes me wonder about replay value.  

As much as I love Lord of the Rings, there are tons of games I would rather play solo/co-op over this.

Despite all the claims, to me this game just doesn't feel very thematic. Instead, it feels like you're flipping over tiles, rolling dice, and trying to find the "hand" or "boots" card amongst the group at the right time. The fact that you can't show everyone what's in your hand doesn't change the fact that it's basically playing from 1 large hand of cards that has just been split amongst the 2-5 players. It doesn't feel like there are many decisions here; you're just playing your hand out and hoping the right tile/dice rolls come up for you.

I much prefer Shadows Over Camelot; even Vanished Planet is probably better. I'd almost drop this to a 5, but will wait to play it more first (but that may be a while!)

RATING: 4
WEAK THEME! Don't listen to the people who say otherwise - they just don't WANT it to be a weak theme, but it is. Compare and contrast it to War Of The Ring, then come back and ask me about theme.

Not a BAD game, but replayability is severely limited, I think - we only managed a handful of games before shelving it.

Co-operative aspect is ruined by the fact that players can freely discuss their cards with the other players.

Lastly, Frodo and Sam's special abilities are clearly the wrong way round - the best strategy is for Frodo to give Sam the ring as soon as possible and then Sam to carry it the rest of the way.

Wonderful co-operative game that is family freindly. Ports the LOTR theme very nicely. Beautiful components but replace the Hobbit counters with some metal ones and that will really complete the aesthetics. The rule book is a real challenge to understand and you will have to consult BGG for clarifications. I have found the game difficult to beat, and have never beaten it playing solo with two characters!

Reiner Knizia's games are often accused of having "pasted on" themes but this is one I think is incredibly thematic.  The game follows the plot of the story of the Lord of the Rings which I quite enjoy.  The characters, items, and events of the game mirror the books quite well and make for a very fine setting for this game.

That said, I found the game a bit boring and very dry.  There just seems to be one thing missing to make this a "game" to me.  The way it is just feels like micromanagement.  I know a lot of cooperative board games involve a lot of micromanagement and risk assessment but they also have something that makes them fun.  This game seems like more work than fun.

Such a brilliant co-op game. It was among my first cooperative gaming experiences so I might have s oft spot for it. BUT the game works so well, just as in the story it is based on the stakes get higher and higher, it gets even exhausting (in a good way) and the tension rises every time you flip to the next board. And when you realize that you have to die so the others can make it, tell me that isn't epic.
Yay, finally got to play it again and still adore it, bonuses for me: it is really hard to beat and there are not many dice decisions, the downside is the player elimination but somehow that makes it very dramatic at the same time; plus the tile draw can be random and mean. Anyhow, I know I still love it!

I got this game as a Christmas present in 2001 when I was 13. It introduced me to more complex and creative board games. It's also because of this game I'm so fond of co-op games.

There was a time when I would have scored this a 9 or a 10. First of all, it captures the essence of the books perfectly in gameplay and in art. Secondly, it's a cooperative game (the first I ever played), and it works, for the most part. Lastly, you can make it as challenging as you like, so it's not an easy victory ever. To win, you really need to sacrifice members of the Fellowship. On the bad side, it does take a while, and some people in my gaming group have declared that they "hate this game". Since that admission, it's been largely unplayed. Perhaps its most major fault, and the fault of most co-op games, is that the experienced players can tend to run things and the inexperienced ones tend to just do as they're told. If the experienced ones let the inexperienced do as they like, it's frustrating, because they won't really do well. Conversely, how much fun is it to have someone play your game for you? You need the right crowd for this to work.

Very novel concept,  the theme of corruption and self sacrifice represents the book better than any battle game based on the books.  The John Howe artwork is some of the most beautiful of any in my collection.  However, the scripted plot (follows the book) means that it gets played about once a year.  I have both expansions.

So you collect suns, hearts, and rings that symboize fortitude, love, and jewelry, or something like that?  Whatever.  This game was a big dissapointment, especially with the gorgeous boards and pieces.  Don't get me wrong; some of the machanics are cool:  moving your characters along the light/dark continuum with Sauron staring you in the face is a superb touch.  But I found the adventure boards with all their multiple progress tracks very clunky.  Sorry, Mr. Knizia, I'm afraid the noise of this intricate machine drowned out all your theme, and a Lord of the Rings game without theme just misses the point.

Edit:  I enjoy this game less and less every time I play it.  Player elimination is one of my least favorite game mechanics, and this game is not won without losing most of the Fellowship.  It can be done, but the game is just poorly thought out.  Not broken.  Barely.

I really wanted to like this one, but (through a fluke, apparently) we just seemed to breeze through for the easy win in three consecutive games. It's probably not meant to go that way, but there's little comfort in that. If there's little to no danger and the group can comfortably make do with their resources, there's no challenge and no fun. I'll probably give it another go in a little while, but I'll be playing something tried and true first.

Excellent co-operative game that beat the rest of the pack to market by years and yet is still better than most of them (I'm looking at you, Shadows Over Camelot). It's less elegant and less strategic than Pandemic, still the gold standard, but the separate conflict boards do a good job conveying a narrative progression. There's a story to it. Much as I usually dislike dice, the threat die works perfectly, adding an element of risk (do you gamble and hope not to lose too much?) and also genuine drama. Very good.

If I ever had much cause to play cooperative games then this would be in regular rotation, but as it is I can't justify holding on to it.

[Based on a few plays] I have played both with and without the expansions.  Really I do not mind this game.  It is a decent enjoyable game to play.  If others want to play it I generally would not oppose it.  I find it especially fitting to play at end of a gameday to wind down.  Really it is not my idea of a main event game.  It is more a game to play after the more serious strategy games are done with.  There is enough luck and somewhat lack of meaningful decisions that this just will never be considered a great game by me.  I do think the design fits the story pretty well and it is a clever way to do it.

RATING: 7.5
[FFG 2001 edition w/ the Black Gate card] {Fantasy, Novel; co-operative, hand management, dice-rolling, player elimination; optimal 5p} LoTR is a vintage cooperative game. It is very thematic and full of player interaction. Players are very engaged in the game. The art work is a classic but the life tokens and shields look childish.

It pleases the fans of The Lord of the Rings very much. I think this game will be even lovelier if the whole fellowship is involved.  I really would like to be Aragon.  Thus, I like the expansions quite much.

It's not easy to teach the rule due to the fiddly rules. There are a few confusions in the rules, it's better to read the FAQs before playing.

I usually left my friends decide how to play LoTR: either seriously or causally. LoTR is challenging when played seriously where players to cooperative really well in order to destroy the ring. Of course, when playing casually (allowing players to leak excessive information), it is also fun.  No matter how you play it, it's very challenging to place Sauron at 10 to start the game.

I love the original and fabulous design of LoTR.  It drives a balance between rushing to finish a scenario and gathering resources with the collection of life tokens without destroying the theme. In addition, the mixture of good and evil tiles is just right - neither too hard nor too easy.  In addition, different aspects and levels of consideration demand strong cooperation.

[Expansions] The expansions are good, but they are not musts though I bought them all :P  Besides, playing LoTR with all expansions will make the game more complex and longer, though it's still manageable and interesting.

[Variants] The 2 extra cards are not necessary: they just make the game much easier without increasing teamwork / competition unless the official variant is used. The 23 new dark event tiles is a nice add-on but allowing players to reject tile may make the game easier. It would be more challenging if a player can only reject at most 2 tiles in his turns.

An absolute masterpiece and unique design. The experience is better if you know Tolkien's background.It's cooperative play, and it works wonderfully; but maybe it's not for everyone.
The expansions add a lot of variety.You can decide on several parameters to set-up the difficulty : starting space for Sauron, one or two or all the expansions, special blue cards (The One Ring, Watchful Peace, The Black Gate).
Some of my best gaming memories are related to this game. I remember some terrific games in unusual dark places with players able to add some role-play, in a 'Tolkien-esque' way.
My suggestions for a strong and flavorful experience : find a nice room where you can diminish the lights; use a few candles ; do not forget the music (soundtrack of LOTR movies, etc.)(first comments made in 2003 - updated May 2012)

A lot of my friends love this game,  I'm not fond of it at all.  The mechanics seem very simple for a such a complex theme. Then you keep repeating the same steps over and over. I would think the game would have a wider array of mechanics, to emulate the decisions Sam and Frodo faced.  IE.. decision "A" run this mechanical gauntlet,  Decision "B" run a totally different mechanical guantlet,  etc...

I guess I'm just not a cooperative play person.

Better as a solitaire game - as a group one person is usually asking what cards others have. A good challenge in single player, but I do accept the argument that this game is won or lost depending on the order tiles are drawn.

Too abstract for my liking. Yes, it seeps in theme, but this does not permeate to the mechanics of the game. Moreover, ends up in long-winded discussions (at least with my group). However, the expansions add quite a lot to the game, and I'd rate it 7 with the Friends & Foes expansion. In my eyes a bit better than the other great cooperative game, "Shadows over Camelot", due to the linearity of the story.

This was one of the first cooperative games I tried.  I was initially very intrigued by the game play.  After playing though I could not see myself playing it again.  The cooperative mechanics were interesting, but I just didn't get transported into Tolkien's world. I just felt like I was playing cards with feet on them etc.

FFG's Lord of the Rings card game though...oh boy.  Great cooperative game for anyone ok jumping into an LCG.

We were all very dissappointed in this game. I guess you expect a lot considering the name. The mechanics were quite original but we found that we were able to beat it quite easily and even with built in 'difficulty setting' the game did not hold too much interest. Maybe we just like competition :)

My first play was a solo game and I actually really enjoyed it.  I look forward to playing it with more people as I think it will really shine.  I like co-op games in general and this is no exception.

One of my favorite things is that the theme is actually tied into the gameplay.  The game gets progressively harder, just as the quest to destroy the ring does.

while this is not the type of game that interests me, if you like this sort of thing it will probably work. I was impressed by how the game fairly chugs along at a decent clip, we got through it in 90 min.  with 3 newbies and one veteran. On the other hand, the beginning stages are really pointless as all the real challenges come at the end. You could knock a half hour off the front half of this game without losing any of the basic drama.

On an initial play this seemed to be quite good fun. Unexpectedly so. I'm (really) not a fan of the books and disliked the films but this game just seemed to work and oddly I wasn't even bothered by the ugliness of the life tokens (the light, the ring and the heart).

Perhaps it's just a sign that I'm now playing co-ops with people that aren't dicks, but this is another one I've enjoyed recently.

There is some obvious luck in the drawing of events, but this seems like a fun game.

It's really hard for me to get cooperative games to the table, and this one is even worse, because there's always that one person that's willing to play [i]almost[/i] anything, but isn't willing to cross the line to a game with this theme.  It's like "I may be playing board games, but I'm not a geek, and Lord of the Rings is only for geeks."  Uh-huh.  Go back to playing Xbox then.

That said, I find that more than half the time I've played this, it ends up with one person dominating the game, and giving instructions to others - either because they want to win, or because there's some other people so clueless (or disinterested) that they have to be told what to do.  That is doubleplusungood.

Not very fun with 2p IMHO.  I dislike how so much of the game is scripted, so that the strategy comes from planning for the cards you'll get and the events that will come up.

The Lord of the Rings game fits my group well.  We all like the books and movies, and the cooperative nature of the game goes along with the theme perfectly.  When you have a nemesis or two in your gaming group that you are always competing against, it feels good to use their brain power for good instead of evil every once in a while.  Also, it doesn't bother me that, for example, Galadriel and Aragorn are functionally identical in the game.  They save you in two different instances, and since I tend to internally fill in the flavor as we play, that works for me.  Our games have tended to balance well, that is we end up struggling through Mordor, not sure if we are going to make it or not.  Add in the fact that the game is easily handicapped for experience, and you have a solid, engaging, exciting game.

I upgraded this to a perfect 10 after 30 or so plays.  A lot of that has to do with how much my kids love the game.  We have had many close finishes, complete with extreme amounts of cheering and groaning.  Great game!

RATING: 7.5
It's essentially a series of trial-and-error situations.  Once you've learned the solutions for each path, you just have to hope that you'll be lucky enough to draw the correct tiles to solve it in time.  There really aren't enough interesting decisions to be made.  You need to do some risk management, but the results of your choices are dependent on memory and luck more than strategy.

The presentation is wildly inconsistent, ranging from the gorgeous boards to the babyish tokens.  Pick an aesthetic and stick with it.

I don't mind it when I'm actually in the middle of a game, but I rarely am in the mood to break it out.

UPDATE: I traded my copy in because I got a good price, but I'd definitely add it to my collection again if I found it at a garage sale or thrift store.  I never was able to give it a go with other people -- only played solo -- which might be a big reason why it never grabbed me.

UPDATE 2: Got another copy.  I'm enjoying it more this time around.  Yes, it's a series of puzzles, but the puzzles are fun and do a really good job of hitting the highlights of the theme and narrative of the story.

A wonderful game.  I don't understand how people find it too much like a puzzle.  Feels just like a game to me.  The hand-management choices are very difficult and interesting.  The random draw of events makes this one of the highest tension games we play.  It's possible that the lack of other human opponents is what stops this from being a 10 for me -- I honestly don't know what it is -- but 9 is damn good.

An excellent game, one of Knizia's best. It provides a nice change of pace from the usual every man for himself games that are generally played, as everyone works together to complete the quest to Mount Doom. Plus the fact that it is LOTR themed is a bonus! :D

RATING: 7
Once I had it organized the way I like, the setup was all the quicker (usually its long set up times that discourage me from pulling a game out).
I wrestled with whether or not to get the Silverline Edition because the expansions are not compatible with it but, as of now, I will say that I love the art much more than what I see for the other editions.  The art is good enough to draw me into the theme.
Gameplay is tough. Lots of luck involved for sure, but it still feels balanced the "right" way. After all, the chances of defeating Sauron should be slim.
Good about the game: Feels thematic.
Not good about the game: Playing solo can be challenging because I need to recall the cards in hand for all the characters (3). Also, even though this isn't the fault of the game, the set-up time keeps me from bringing it out a lot which, in turn, means I need to refresh myself with the rules every time I play.

Won easily as the Fellowship (3 players) in our first game with Sauron starting on 15. All hobbits were 2-3 spaces in front of Sauron so starting him on 12 in the next game should be more of a challenge.

Got our butt handed to us in our second game (2 players) when starting Sauron on 12; also easily lost the third game (2 players) starting Sauron on 15. Seems to be a difficult game for 2 players. Initial rating of 6.

RATING: 8
I get why some hate this game.  I can understand how someone would see this as dry and abstract.

However, I think the game is great fun and what I find most amazing is that such an abstract game can feel so much like an adventure.  The game really asks you to use a lot of imagination.  Playing a card that simply shows a picture of the Phial of Galadrial and has a poorly drawn foot in the corner doesn't immediately evoke the feeling of finding your way through Shelob's Lair.  

But if I take a little time to create the story (in your head or out loud) and savor it for just a split second I find that I can create a version of my favorite story.

I believe you would almost have to love the book or movie to really enjoy the game.  Without creating the story it is just a simple game of efficiency.

The game is also very open to scaling it to your own sweet spot.  You can start Sauron closer or farther, add the Foes (I haven't yet), or play with other hobbits.  

Most of the components are excellent.  I love that they went with the John Howe artwork.  The figures are nice.  

I hate the event tiles.  They are completly incrongruous with the rest of the beautiful art.

I have only played this as a two-player (with my wife who also loves LoTR).  I can see that this could be more fun with more.

I understand why some wouldn't like it, but for me it is not only the best cooperative around it is one of my favorite story/adventure games.

Update: I can no longer say this the best co-op around. Pandemic is just too good. But, Lord of the Rings, you will always be my first and no game can ever take that away.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

RATING: 7
My wife and I enjoy this, but it isn't something we pull out all the time. The unrelenting progress of doom is all there in the game, but the relief or the catastrophe that should be the endgame is lacking. It's something that we always find anticlimactic. So, how, in a  game, do you convey the utter disaster of Sauron reclaiming the Ring or the fantastic sense of actually having saved the world? My guess is that, unfortunately, this is about as close as it gets.

I've only played the base game, and all of my plays are with children.  I'm not sure how well this would hold up with adults (without the expansions).  I have Friends and Foes and Sauron, so I will definitely give it a try sometime.  I do like the game with kids, but sometimes feel like I have to build the tension in the game by making things seem more intense than they are.  Then again, since we usually have new players, we don't start Sauron at 12 (last game we started at 14).  Maybe that will add the tension I'm looking for.

Very fun game - I really like the cooperative format.  Also plays well as a single player game.  Strategy element becomes less interesting once you've learned the tricks to win, but the quality of the theme has led me back to it several times since then anyway.  This game has inspired me to create solo/cooperative variants of other games.

This is a really fun tough co-operative game. The artwork is amazing and classic. The powers of the Hobbits is fun, the fact that Fatty Bulger is in the game is great, and the game while really tough is a blast to try and beat and when you lose, you want to try and beat it again. It seems a little bit old in looks, but it doesn't play that way, and since it is classic artwork, it's very enjoyable.

The Lord of the Rings Board Game is one of the early examples of coop games. As far as I know it's the first full coop euro game, and for that it should receive merit. Today though we can see the many design flaws in this one. It features player eliminiation which is a no go for a coop. It can be unwinnable even if you play it perfect. While it tells you a story, it does tell the same one over and over again, and a story we all know far too well on top of that.

As I said, this game should receive some merit. But it aged very bad.

Fun and interetsing cooperative gameplay. The game mechanic really recreates the intensity and mood of Frodo's perilous journey. Great gameplay is totally enhanced by both the art and the production value of the board, cards, and bits. Great for non-gamers and young'uns, too. Fun!!!

One play -  I'm almost scared to play this again because I had such a fun time playing it the first time I am not sure I can ever recover it.  I actually felt like I was a character in the novel.  I'm not a big LOTR fan, nor do I get into the spirit of roleplaying.  This was an absolute blast.  Reminds me of golfing, i.e. a fun way to get frustrated.

More plays - Its still fun.  Lots of it.   The golfing analogy holds true, you are playing against the course, and the course is designed to screw with you.  Really looking forward to playing with the expansions, once I figure out how to crush Sauron.  Muhahahaha!  I'm not a big cooperative person, so this 9 is probably a 10 if you like the coop thing.

Hmm... this hasn't aged well for me... i can only see it as a two player game for potential "coaching" problems with players with different levels of experience.  The game doesn't play you... you are just a pawn of "the coach".  Plus, if someone playing is making a drastic bad decision, I feel like I should "coach" him to make a better move, because his horrible decision takes the fun out of it for me.  

Inherent problem of the co-op genre for me I guess. 

The newer coop games leave this one in the dust.  Space alert and pandemic would be my coop choice over this every single time and twice on sunday.

Why is this game rated so fricking highly. I found it to be utterly miserable for the entire nearly 3 hours we played! Now I will say we played with the expansion(s) (not sure if there were more than 1 expansion) and we didn't get to "bypass" any areas so we were playing through EVERY SINGLE FREAKING BOARD! Problem with that is they are all basically the same damn thing.  Geesh. Tedium best describes this lousy time killer.

SOLD (3/19/09) - I'm a huge fan of Reiner Knizia, and I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings books and movies, but for some reason this game just didn't grab me.  It may be due to the cooperative nature of the game, but I'm not sure.  I should really try it out more to make sure I'm not missing something, but there are so many good games to play that this one never hits the table any more.

[Rated 2005/05/06 based on 1 play]

(Several plays pre-Geek)

Captures the spirit of the books well - it doesn't necessarily feel like you are fighting orcs or creeping through Moria, but it *does* feel like you're struggling together to accomplish something in the face of the threat of corruption, possibly sacrificing one or more of your party to do this.

A little bit long and a little bit fiddly, but good fun.  Cooperative play is a nice change of pace.

The game was enjoyable, although as every other human being on earth I'm sure has noted, it is not immune to the Curse of Coops (a less vocal person makes few independent decisions).

Takes the narrative tropes of an "American" game (like an [GAMEID=15987] or [GAMEID=10547]) and marries them to Euro mechanics. To me this is a really interesting reminder that there's nothing sacred about dice and tables when it comes to scripting game narratives.

Interesting to note, though, that you only get prose narrative in this game through the Event track, and Events are generally a [i]bad[/i] thing, to be avoided. The opportunities on the board correspond to events from the novels, but have no narrative associated with them in the game. So, the better you succeed at the game, the [i]less[/i] theme you get. This seems like a major missed opportunity.

Also: Little white cones? Not the best choice. Big chunky plastic Eye of Sauron? More like it.

Simply AWEFUL game.  The DEFINITION of pasted on theme.  Frankly, I'd have enjoyed it a lot more if they'd stripped the LOTR theme off and made it a purely abstract cooperative game.  

It's not a game, it's a puzzle disguised to look like a game.  Oh, and if the random card draws are against you, it is often impossible to win.  Combine this with the fact that players can be eliminated, and we have a trifecta of suck.  No wait, we've passed three sucks a while back.  What's the equivalent of a Trifecta with five things?

1> It murders what should be an excellent theme!
2> The only decision to make is, Do I do the only option, or do I choose to Lose?  This makes it not a game, but a puzzle where you put the pieces in in order. 
3> Randomness results in a frequently unwinnable non-game.  Because often the pieces you get don't fit in the puzzle there, so you die.
4> Crap plastic bits that look like crap, combined with crap artwork, means it isn't even pretty to look at.  If the art on the cards were better, or if the player pieces were detailed rather than identical molded plastic, it might distract you from the lack of actual depth.
5> Oh yeah, it's pretty easy for someone to F up in the first or second encounter and be eliminated!  HUZZAH! Oh what fun!  Sit and wait for a hour while your friends continue to suck their way to failure in a rather ugly non-game!  

All in all, this one is pretty aweful.

It's put me off Reiner Knizia.

See, Reiner, adding a solid theme to your games isnt that hard. ;) I like this one for the following reasons: 1)Its solid knizia gameplay.2)Its one of those rare good cooperative games3)This is a Knizia attempt that is steeped in theme rather than having a contrived theme slapped on top of game mechanics. It is still abstract, but a great deal from the books is incorporated into the game mechanics.

Opinions vary greatly on this game - I LIKE IT! It is a collaborative effort, and the theme is well known. Its downfall is that there is little relationship between your actions and their results, and there is a lot of randomness - yet that seems much like what faced the Fellowship on their real journey.  I would play this any time, really like the F&F expansion, and really want to try Battlefields.

RATING: 10
Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game where the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power. The game is played on a number of boards: the Master board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits, and a number of scenario boards which detail the events and adventures of particular locations. Progression across the boards is determined by playing cards (many of which represent the characters and items of Middle Earth), and the effects of corruption are represented by a special die. The game is lost if the ring-bearer is overcome by Sauron, or won if the ring is destroyed by throwing it into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.

Replayed this classic after a couple of years, and found that it still offers an entertaining challenge, but is sadly not up to the  standard set by more recent co-op titles like Ghost Stories and, specifically, Pandemic. The underlying mechanic is still brilliant, but the game just isn't as involving as those modern titles. Rating may still, however, rise with more than two players
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
LOTR is a precursor to other co-op games. This game really elevated the co-op genre in the eyes of gamers, with Pandemic sealing the deal much later.  Even if the game is more than 15 years old, it clearly shows many elements that are still widely used in other co-op games such as mechanism of "evil/disaster/calamity occurs ahead of each player action" In the case of LOTR, having to flip over multiple event tiles to trigger bad events really elevates the tension and difficulty of the game. Unfortunately, that also brings a heavier dose of luck into the game play. I particularly enjoy how thematic the game is. Many elements on the game boards, cards and mechanisms really meshes well with how the story progresses in the books. Knizia can do theme!

Still, the atmosphere of playing a co-op is always thick with tension and immersive. I find it a very good change of pace from your standard competitive games. I have never been a huge fan of co-op games, but this genre is slowly warming up to me as the heavier FFG games fall wayside.

The classic co-op, I haven't revisited this since the co-op craze of the last few years. I've always enjoyed it though. It's a great design that almost always defeats you on the precipice of victory, or allows you to squeak in a seemingly unlikely win under the gun. Yet you can also learn to play the game better, then ramp up the difficulty as you adapt.

Lord of the Rings.  Coop strategy boardgame.

My girlfriend loves this game and as a result we play it often.  I enjoy the game and nearly always feel like playing it whenever it is suggested.  I rarely suggest this game myself as there are too many other game that I prefer.  The game is a co-op and demands that players work carefully together.

Solid and easy to learn cooperative game. This is a real fun game to play with my little brother and his friends. They range in age from 6-12 and all really like swords and beasties and such. This game quenches their hunger without having to get into meatier fantasy type games like Descent.

A superb achievement from Dr. Knizia.  Cooperative gameplay the is best touch (other than a very well-executed theme, of course).  Deep, immersive, gorgeous.  Only flaw, IMHO, is just how much luck is involved.  The event tiles are so powerful that no amount of collaborative strategy can save you if you draw poorly, and likewise you can be rash buffoons yet still succeed if you draw well.  However, the play is still mostly fun even if you have one of the statistical outlier tile-draw game sessions.

I have just discovered coop games and picked this one up used and I'm glad I did.  The game is somewhat abstract yet it captures the story very well.  An amazing design.  The components are very nice (though the ring itself is kind of clunky).  The artwork is terrific.  The rules are laid out fairly well (we were able to play our first game with only minimal reference to the rules).  The game has adjustable difficulty so that adds to replay value.

Positive sides:
1) The game wins _very_ often.
2) Co-op: You are competing against the game itself, not against each other. This means that everyone does not need to know all rules.

Negative sides:
1) Dominant player: There are a lot of rules and items and if someone does not know all rules and all prerequisites, that person might be put on the side and "ordered around" by the others.

Very unique, even among cooperative games.  Competing together against the board can be a welcome change, especially if you just got done squabbling over a rules ambiguity in a high-conflict game.  LotR is my favorite cooperative game, as it gets players immersed in the narrative in a way in which other games ([gameid=30549], [gameid=7240]) don't always manage.  My favorite example of a well-themed euro, this has lots of little nods to the storyline, but nicely packaged into the game system so that they don't feel tacked-on.  Has surprising amount of replay value, especially for a cooperative game.  Everyone should try it.

Intriguing game and strange how it works so well for all player numbers. I love how the essence of the theme is captured in an unusual and imaginative way.

Cooperative game with some nice mechanics (there's luck but also decisions and debates between the players).
I prefer it with 4 players (but can be a fine solitaire as well).
It can't be played a lot of times one after the other (too repetitive in the sequence of "bad events"), but it's still nice when you play it (again) after some time.

This was my very first co-op game and also the first board game I played solo. 

I maintain that despite the mechanics looking abstract on the surface, this does an great job of capturing its source material. Whereas other LotR based games often focus on combat, this concentrates on the Fellowship's journey to Mount Doom and does so through literal progress tracks that can be filled up by using items, enlisting the help of allies etc. 

The only problem is that the videogame esque linear progression through several distinct "levels" limits replayability somewhat.

I love the strong interaction that usually comes along with cooperative games. Same here. Since 'Lord of the Rings' actually was the first time I came into contact with this game mechanic concept, I probably drove my friends nuts with my desire to play it again and again and again. Further more the game captures the atmosphere of the saga in a nice and lovely way.

Later we got the 'Sauron Expansion' and 'Arkham Horror' at around the same time and the game lost its appeal. After I had to leave it behind when dissolving my living community I didn't feel the desire to reown it. I would not hesitate though to play it again - as long as we leave the Sauron Expansion in its box.

I love the artwork and the idea of a cooperative LOTR game.  However, the only thing that felt really thematic to me were going through the events on the different boards and picking up the different special cards in each location.

This is a strange one. Move pawns up and down a track to collect tokens with meaningless symbols on them, until the point at which a completely arbitrary event either wins or loses you the round. Then move the pawns to another arcane board and do it all again. It's really bizarre.

In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit that I tricked myself into liking this when I first bought it. The world was in the grip of a Peter Jackson inspired Lord of the Rings mania and I sort of got swept along. That's not to say it's a bad game, it does exactly what it sets out to do. The players have to pool their resources together and use them to navigate an obstacle course. As one of the first co-op boardgames that didn't completely suck, it was actually a pretty neat experience. The reason my feelings about it have changed is that so many better co-ops have been released over the past few years. When you look at how well games like Pandemic, Arkham Horror, and Battlestar Galactica relate their mechanisms to theme...the Knizia game just seems silly and disconnected.

I gave this an 8 back in it's heyday. I still consider it one of the more important games in the evolution of the hobby, but I don't think playing it is as fun as it once was.

RATING: 10
Love the requirement for true cooperation, the ease of difficulty level adjustment, the constant pressure on the Fellowship.  It has some luck, yes, and some sameness from game to game, but overall I think Knizia succeeded brilliantly.

Also, I see a lot of remarks about the lack of theme, but that view is rubbish; the theme is strong, but expressed in an unusual way.

After many plays, I must concede that the base game alone is too linear, and that the "main path rush" is just too strong (which reduces replayability even more).  But that's what expansions are for.

good quality componants (although the resin hobbits are a little crude) and a good looking game, not one of my faevorites by any stretch of teh imagination

this game seems really to hard to me, it is possible we are playing it wrongly though, this makes me  retinsent to play the thing sometimes it is frustrating 

i dont think we have ever actually finished it

RATING: 8
Very nice co-op with interesting group vs. individual tensions and a nice amount of complexity.

I often read that this game has less replay value than other co-ops, and I've got to say I find that baffling.  If anything, this game seems to get better with more plays as players can better plan ahead for the events.

RATING: 9
Likes:  Big cards!  Nice boards.   Solo plays have been tense, and surprisingly atmospheric.   In my head,  everything looks like a dull resource management game where you play wimpy hobbits,  but when I'm playing you feel like heroic hobbits hacking and slashing through and escaping from the skin of your teeth.  Some minor misprints on the cards (some of the colors on some of the pictures didn't come through).  

Dislikes:  The flattened ring.  What happened,  Sauron stepped on it?

Bits:  Nice insert.  Hobbits and Sauron came packed in a styrofoam box.  Wooden markers and die came in a plastic baggy.   Die has engraved faces.

I love this game!  Very different from any I've ever played, and very very hard.  The first time I played it, we won the game, and I was only moderately impressed.  Now I know how lucky I was, and have learned how much strategy is required to make a successful win.

I like this game a lot. This is my first cooperative game and I thought I wouldn't get used to the comcept. However I like the gameplay and I find a lot of people, even non-gamers, get into the cooperative aspect quickly. Like a session of problem solving and group decison making. Thumbs way up!

This game gets its 10 from the unique co-operative gaming aspect and gaming mechanisms. You play against the board/system and it's not easy to win. All this without compromising on theme. One of those rare game that scales from 2-5 players. Great board art and pawn for Sauron.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've played this a lot. It's a little abstract but all the bits and boards are really nice and the artwork is great. I recommend buying it used.

I've been playing two players with the Friends & Foes expansion. So far we've made it as far as 48. The last game we barely made it past 30 and the last few steps were grueling. I kept thinking we had lost and then we came up with a way to stay in the game three or four times.

We finally won the base game with three players and haven't played in a while. After reading the strategy tips the game is obviously WAY harder for two players when playing with Friends & Foes. So... we need to line up some more players before we'll try it again.

Old comments: The last game we played we got hammered in Moria. We got like 7 event tiles in a row. I was trying to teach a friend how to play so this made it rough. Ugh. We kept with it and got to 37. Yikes. So this is a fun game, but bad luck can make it rough with little room for skill/strategy to help. Also, I wish the theme and gameplay were a little closer together. I want to feel more like we're battling those battles etc. Still, I like the game a lot. It's fun working together.

RATING: 7.5
Based on a game with my 5 years old son and a game in 4 players (one of them again my son): the game is simpler than it looks, it manages to give some idea of the theme. It produces some involvement and you have a feeling of "togheterness". It's quite random but what you can appreciate is the fact that you are deciding things togheter, planning, accepting sacrifices for others or from others, the victory seems near but losing also is always very near !

"Deliver the ring to Sauron," indeed.  A very good cooperative game, but with completely open table talk, and no individual goals, really just a solitare game with kibbitzers.

A fun evening, though this game is too long for our group. 2 player is very easy to beat , 3 or more player is harder (but less played). The real weakness is that the more experienced players will dominate game play. We always play with Friends & Foes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's a co-operative game, so you can't win. Where's the fun in
that? I've played a few good games of it, but it lacks a

This is on one play an interesting game. The whole point is to beat the game with communication, planning, and some luck in drawing of cards. I like that the different hobbits all have different abilities, so all in all I will rate this a 8. It was a hit with the Fiance, so we will take it up to her familiy and see what they say...

RATING: 9
Still my favourite cooperative game and an absolute must-have for any fan of the book and film. Played with the right group you can really feel the quest and explore the theme. The artwork by John Howe is fantastic. The rulebook is not well written, but I would advise using many of the excellent player aids available here on BGG.

RATING: 4
This is a game where the witless marriage of theme and gameplay actually turn me off. Normally I don't care very much about theme and mechanics interconnecting, but with this game it just rubs me the wrong way. Definitely not a game for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Card driven fantasy co-op.  Play cards from hand that match symbols along primary and alternate tracks of each quest leading to Mount Doom.  Get help from starting Elron items and the timely arrival of Gandalf.  The corruption track draws the fellowship into the clutches of Sauron.  Event tokens and card draws lead to very random game results.  Decisions are straightforward.  Light and nostalgic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A co-operative game, destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. The Master board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron. Scenario boards detail the events of particular locations. Progress by playing cards which represent the characters and items of Middle Earth.

I was probably a good game when it came out, but has been completely overshadowed but just about any co-op out there. So you have to read this score in a 'if it came out now' or 'would you play it now' kind of way... not in a 'it was bad when it came out' sense.

Important to note: I do not like The Lord of the Rings.

RATING: 10
Enthralling, if you're into the theme. Very immersive, especially with the expansions.

29/05/2017: The problem I have with my copy is that it's the Silver Line edition from FFG and they didn't ever bring out the expansions for it. I really enjoyed LoTR with Sauron and Friends and Foes, but without those I would play it happily but I'm also played out on it. This game also has the problem of later co-ops that have really superseded it in terms of mechanics (Forbidden Desert) and epic narrative (Pandemic Legacy). If I'm going to play a 5-player 1-hour co-op it's probably going to be Forbidden Desert at the moment, and I'm not the biggest co-op fan due to the alpha-player problem, so I just can't see a space for this in my collection. I still highly recommend it for fans of the books/movies as a way to engage with that world as a member of the fellowship (rather than as some sort of hand of God like in War of the Ring).

My copy is has only been played twice, the other plays were on a friend's big-box copy from back in the early 2000s

RATING: 9
A challenging game and a favorite on Game Night. I have played it solataire a few times using Frodo and Sam and enjoyed it.  The F&F expansion makes it all the more challenging and gives the players more decisions to make. Adding the Sauron Expansion adds a level of competition and takes away the randomness off rolling the die.  I find that it's easy to get the girls to join in on game night with this game and it's always nice to have some girls to game with.

In this game, players take the role of hobbits in the classic Tolkien story.  Working together in this cooperative game, players move towards Mordor and attempt to destroy the One Ring.  Very thematic and tense game play.  You can adjust the difficulty to make the game easy or very challenging.

RATING: 6
Really hard co-op game.  I don't think I've ever won.  I'd like to pick up the expansions at some point.  My wife DETESTS co-op games (or any game she can't make ME lose) so this game doesn't get a ton of play.  I don't expect that to change with the influx of much better co-ops recently.

Very thematic and interesting take on LOTR. A true masterpiece of game design. After you learn the "tricks" it starts getting pretty easy to win with Sauron starting on 12. So add the Friends & Foes expansion. If that gets too easy, add the Sauron expansion.

RATING: 7.25
I was surprised by this.  I bought this game about 2 years ago based on a few reviews but mostly because of the fantastic series of review/play-through videos by Grudunza.

After the purchase, I began hearing negative reviews about it.  The refrain was that, 'It becomes repetitive."  Others stated that newer cooperative games are much better.  I shelved it but because I love most things that have to do with The Lord of the Rings, my eye always lingered on the box as I decided what to play.

I recently pulled it out and played a number of games solo.  I have missed a wonderful gaming experience for these last few years by ignoring it.  It drew me in immediately and I wanted to share the experience with my family, having them play also.  

The feel of the books and movies is woven throughout the game.  The tension level is high.  The difficulty level draws you into wanting to give it another go after your most recent failed quest.

In addition, I like the cooperative rule of not having your cards splayed out for every other player to see as is the mechanic in most other coop games.  You must talk to the other players instead of only gazing at their cards.  This seemingly small element adds tension because of trust issues.  You think, "Can I trust my Fellowship members, or are they tanking it to force me to play my cards while saving theirs?"

Though I see the game may get repetitive, the expansions all add variety and new ways to strategically move through the quest.  I want them all! :)

Played several times (with 3 to 5 players). A very nice cooperative game with an intense story feeling (of course, being a LotR fan helps - as well as the very nice production). I have not played enough to worry about the replayability, and the expansions definitely help renew the game anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The first play was confusing and OK. The second was very tense as Sauron steadily marched towards us. The third was a great time, a real struggle all the way to morder where I sacrified myself so that the player with the ring could make it.

This is my favorite co-op game. The rules are fairly convoluted and fiddly, but it is a difficult tense game with lots of tough decisions to make.

It is a good cooperative game. I played it several times already (in contradiction what BGG says ... I was not recording plays then). It is fun several times but gets quite easy and not so great after that. 

After few plays it lost its appeal partially due its abstract advanced mechanism, although I do admit that as whole it does fell thematic.

A surprisingly fun game. I must admit it did take some time for my friends and I to get to grips with 'helping' one another and sharing equipment etc. After we had come to terms with the fact we couldn't mame, kill and destroy our allies and started working together we had great fun. A good fun game to while away the hours with enough subtle strategy to keep you coming back for more.

RATING: 7
Cooperative LoTR themed game.  Unlike other cooperative game where someone is playing the villain, in this game everyone is truely cooperative.  This game is interesting and different.  Others have said that with repeated play, it devolves into group-think solitaire.  I can see that although I have not experienced it.  The expansions to the game appear to mitigate that problem.  I have not played them yet though.

I agree that it is not remotely like D&D (as that was the designers intent) but i would also argue that the new ways that have been used in this game to represent *all* the elements of fantasy adventure are no more artificial that all the D&D cloning going on within the dungeoncrawl genre. In fact what he has done is capture all the elements but with mechanics that intentionally bare no resemblance to the current conventions. He does have maps, but intentionally different. He does have character advancement, but intentionally different. etc etc.

We are so caught up in redoing D&Ds artificial conventions that something radically different (but just as realistic at portraying the fantasy environment) comes off as abstract when it is not. Dungeoncrawl is not a theme but it is a body of "D&D like" mechanics. This is a very difficult thing for some to see.

This really is one of Knizia's greatest achievements because it is a slap in the face of what we considered dungeoncrawl and really makes us think about it.

w00t!  Wife likes it - instant winner!  Actually, more than that, this is a GREAT game.  Like all "the great" games, it's balancing act.  There are a half dozen things you WANT to do at any given moment, of which you can only do one...trying to decide when to do what, what cards to hold on to, what track to advance on...it's a lot of fun.  And the fact that the game is played cooperatively makes it  a great 'couples' game.  You both win, or you both lose together.

So far I've only played solitaire to learn the rules.  I messed up a few things as I went but it wasn't all that difficult.  It was mentioned that planning ahead is an important aspect of playing this game well.  It does seem a little bit odd just how specific the plans need to be given the story line of the books.  I like the game a great deal and it could go up or down a little bit.  I did appreciate all of the short quotes that added a great deal of flavor to the game which could be rathehr cold and mechanical otherwise.   There is the "keep all the plates spinning and don't let one drop" sort of thing going on here.

The first game introducing me to CO-OP board games. But after a couple of plays, it feels too mechanical to me. The game is quite abstract, where you could almost see through the Lord of the Rings veneer.

Mechanically the game is okey, but not great. You can easily tweak the difficulty of the game by decreasing the 'allowance of failure'. Luck plays a factor in play and as a team you need to take that into account when making decisions on what cards to play.

But that are better CO-OPs out there, in the same spectrum of playtime or complexity, which makes this game obsolete to me. But I do thank this game for it's introduction to CO-OP games in the first place for me.

RATING: 9
One of the first "geeky" board games I owned. Having not played it for years I recently dug it out and got back into it.

It's a very fun co-operative game, where the players play up to five hobbits (the Fellowship four plus Fatty, who I wish they'd given his proper name of Fredegar! -- and those of you who haven't read the books will sadly have no idea who he is) working together through various episodes of the Lord of the Rings.

Good, tough co-op. I was lukewarm to it at first but I really enjoy it now. Even though it's abstract, it still manages to tell the story. Definitely a struggle where it feels like an accomplishment to even make it far.

I'm not a big LOTR fan, but this is an almost perfect gaming experience. Challenging, strategic, and featuring lots of player interaction as you discuss what actions to take. Game seems to mold itself and change perfectly to conform to the number of people playing it. Even friends of mine who HATE complex games ended up loving this one. Great John Howe art (that's probably him as Gandalf), cool wooden pieces, and neat progress board shows you how screwed you are in the game. A few rule questions (mostly involving matters of procedure) precipitate the need for a revised rule book (the one that comes with the game is pretty spotty). It's the kind of liscensed game that even my beloved Star Wars would kill to have made.

RATING: 8
Excellent achievement in game design and cooperative mechanics, but seems a bit forced -- you actually have far fewer options and choices than first appears. The expansions add depth, but additional frustrations. With a good group that wants to enjoy the experience of a game, this rates a 9. With a group looking for cooperative strategy and more meat, this rates a 7 or lower.

The feel of the narrative of the original books is well-captured in this games.  It truly does feel like you are in genuine jeopardy the whole way through.  I think the game is oddly easier with less hobbits (players) than with more.  The resources which you have are not spread as thin with only two or three, thus making it easier to actually win the game.  I've yet to try any of the expansions, though.

I like that you don't play against other players, but against the game itself.  But this leads to a low replay value once you figure out how to cooperate with the other players to get past the various difficulties of the board.

[b]MOST ENJOYABLE.[/b]

This fantastic game was my first geeky geek geek game for geeks that I bought while entering the second phase of my boardgaming life. Knizia's LoTR was a solid waypoint on my road to BGG. I do like this spin on Tolkien's mega-quest, but I'd be the first to hold up my hand and say that if I'd been tasked with creating a LOTR boardgame, this is not what I would have produced - that's why I'm not a world-renowned game designer!

The players all take the role of hobbits working their way to Mt.Doom to destroy the One Ring. You know the plot.
Cardplay powers the game through different gameboards representing Shelob's Lair, Moria, and Mordor, etc.
The theme is good, the boards are cool, and the co-op system is fairly unique. There is some talk of the game being slightly abstract, and I can see that POV. I admire this Knizia effort, and I do find myself thoroughly immersed in the theme, loving the artwork. It also helps muchly if the whole group are huge LOTR fans.
We have only beaten this once in twenty games: it's tough!

The game seems to split groups right down the middle, with those liking, and those disliking it, IMO.
I've never found myself being "played" by the game, but others retain this memory of the experience. Maybe if I'd played this game to death, analysed every failed attempt, argued over the use of everyone's cards, I would have tired of it, knowing when to "hide" or "fight," but that's simply not been the case for me.

On the subject of expansions, Battlelfields is a marvellous addition to the base game in that it increases the epic feel of the adventure, with the entire fellowship involved at last. I don't like the flowchart presentation of the boards, but after including it in our games I forgot all about that as we struggled to complete our mission against the forces of evil. The expansion grows the game  decision tree and increases your immersion in the quest.

BTW, Reiner, the rulesbook is a complete dog, needing a rewrite badly; I'm sure this has put off casual game players. There is a reason why you can pick up a copy of this game on eBay for zip any day of the week, and it's not overproduction!

THEME IMMERSION TIP: replace the hobbit pawns and Sauron with painted miniatures. If you have the time to do so, I'd highly recommend it.

[b]THE GANDALF:[/b]

1. Glorious artwork.
2. Multi-board quest locations.
3. Cooperative.
4. Rich theme.
5. Narrative-forming gameplay.

[b]THE SARUMAN:[/b]

1. Abstract.
2. Terrible rulebook.
3. Tough.
4. Needs expansions to shine like the Star of Elendil.

NB. Check out my rules for using Gollum as one of the players. IT'S MY PRECIOUS!

I own ALL of the expansions.

RATING: 7
Love the co-op aspect, as well as the tension throughout the game since it seems that bad draws always outnumber the good ones, and there never seem to be enough cards to do what you wanted.  However, I don't really like how quests are handled, I guess they are somewhat too simplistic for my taste.  Game doesn't exactly give off the epic feeling of the series.

RATING: 7.8
Knizia has done a splendid job of making the quest terrifying and difficult.  Having Sauron a part of the game, but not a player is a brilliant design move.  This is a cutthroat game of five hobbits against the game design.

I wanted this one for a long time due to it's co-operative aspects and the theme.

Rated 9.5 After one play

EDIT:  So, I think I have been leaving this at a 9.5 for far too long.  The rating may drop even more.  The problem is that I just never get to play it.  I find it draining, and that doesn't fit the description of a 9.5 in my book.  I still think it is a fantastic game, but I definately need to be in the right frame of mind to want to play it.

After 2+ Plays: I've got two problems with this game, and with many co-op games in general.  First, I'm just not entertained by purely co-operative games.  I want to match wits with a person, not a cardboard computer.  This may be fixed with the Sauron expansion, so I'd like to try that.  Secondly, I don't like having no chance to win regardless of my actions, but not finding that that is the case until the end of the game.  This also seems to a problem in other games that pit you against the game system.  Though the difficulty may average out to tough but beatable, some sessions are impossible to win.

Nice cooperative "players against the system" gameplay, but rather un-flavoured game board and such. Still, that doesn't stop it from being a real cool cooperative game. Once I got the Friends & Foes expansion, I don't play the game without it.

:sauron: Extremely clever game design. I own the 2nd Edition Hasbro version.

:sauron: 11 years late getting this game, but as good as, if not better than other co-op's like Pandemic.

:sauron: Some folk say the newer FFG edition is far better. But just like the book, or a fine wine, the Hasbro edition has matured with age. I tried to play the FFG edition once, but after setting up the game, I just thought - no thanks, boxed it back up, and returned to my beloved original copy.

Might have been great 10 years ago but now there's too many other co-op games around. Try Legends of Andor or Middle-Earth Quest (semi co-op) instead. Maybe even Defenders of the Realm. This is one is über-dry compared to the other ones. But you have to give Mr Knizia credit here: he tried very hard to paste the theme on :D

Кооперативная игра от Книция - много математики, есть кубик (случай), очень сложная для прохождения - в результате от удачи зависит многое, хотя по-началу так не кажется: выпадение на кубике непотребств, выход карточек сценария во время боевой части игры, в результате от игроков требуется выбрать себе лидера, отдать ему бразды и тихо смотреть, как он пытается добраться до Ородруина. 

Возможно, игра входит в топ100 из-за дополнений, но их у меня нет.

Feels a bit more abstract than other, newer cooperative games, so I always thought that everyone's praises of how thematic the game is were a little funny. Still, this is a great game and a relevant one. The quality of the production, which is important to me, is top-notch. Everything looks great.

Own the Friends & Foes expansion.

4/9/07 - LOTR is hard to compare to other games because it is so unlike any other game.  Don't listen to comparisons with other "cooperative" games (like Arkham Horror).  They all suck hard and this one rocks.  I think what's best about this game is that I can be on the same team as my friends, rather than having to compete against them, and that alone skyrockets this game to the top.  When you play this game, your actions are so intimately intertwined with your allies' that you begin to feel bad when you have to stop to draw cards because you feel like you've let them down.  I have played this game in excess of 15 times and its just as great as ever.
---
Lord of the Rings is one of the best games ever made.  In it, you get to be part of a Dream Team of hobbits, braving the corrupting influence of Sauron in an effort to cast the One Ring of power back into the firey bowels of Mt. Doom.  When I play, I usually die somewhere in the middle of the ashen wastes of Gorgoroth, having endured so much pain and agony at the hands of evil, only to return the Ring to Sauron's hand and plummet all of Middle Earth into Shadow.

It doesn't feel strategic enough to me. It seems that you win or lose based on what order you draw event tiles. I've only played once solo and half a 2 player game though. I'll give it another chance soon.

House rules = Shuffle upgrade cards together and draw 3, buy 1 during turn. VP cards = 1/2 the amount of chits as there are on the card (for shorter, more manageable game). 
*VP Chips secret, only province vp scored on track
*On clearing of 4th vp card, everyone has one more turn then game ends.

I'm not entirely sure what captivates me about this game. It could be one thing, but I think it's more likely the interplay of all the mechanisms. From the strange naming of the provinces, to the slightly drab colour scheme, the minimalist card art or perhaps the abstractions of this flavour of deckbuilding, Wallace has crafted a compelling title that (despite its end game issue) manages to stick in my head long after each play.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent game that I have enjoyed every minute of. There's absolutely no way the play time is 60 minutes, even in a two-player game, but it's still a brilliant game. It will take a little while for new players to get their heads around the key concepts, but once you've accessed the game you've got something really amazing in your hands. 

Frequent complaints regarding this one are its length (which is warranted); the randomised province handout at the beginning in 2-player (which I actually like. The 3/4 player province draft adds to an already hefty playtime); the odd, protracted way you claim victory (which may be warranted, but I actually like the tension that creates and the harsh look at how efficient your deck versus your opponents is) and the shoddy counters in the normal set of the game (which are very poor indeed - I replace them with wooden components I use for playtesting games).

Edit 31/8/05 - I still think the game has gotten a raw deal. It's cheap on Amazon and holds a relatively poor score here on BGG. I think this game is far better than people have given it credit for. It's currently priced at £17 on Amazon which I would consider a ludicrious bargain for a game of this quality.

Instant success in my group.

Very tight game, with the players fighting very closely for the victory until the bitter end.

Many strategic angles to worry about, such as neighboring frontiers, boats on your coast, the benefit of road and castle building, resources you lack and where to get them, and on top of that, the race to strengthen your deck and all the options you have to do that.

Overall, a very tight, intelligent, light wargame. It actually feels like a crossover, such as Wallenstein.

Great game.

I've seen mixed reviews about the game's presentation, but even with the non-limited edition I love the very smooth and simplistic graphic design. But beyond that, it's such an interesting premise...a mix of deckbuilding mechanics, cards with multiple uses, and area control...it's like Risk meets Dominion, but with further nuances, like the Reserves. Good variable set up so you'll have different territories and Victory Point conditions in each game. Wallace rocks. Again.

The best highly flawed game ever. So strange. The mechanics are great, it is fast and there's always tension. The deckbuilding aspect balances out the game perfectly. But strangely, some parts (buying cards, initial regions etc.) are not implemented elegantly.

Well, no, it doesn't reimplement A few acres of snow. It feels like a hybrid between aFAoS and Antike. It plays well, although the area control element is too chaotic. I find it inferior than aFAoS, but still a game that I enjoyed. Something is missing to tie the mechanics together in the same way as other Wallace games.

RATING: 5
The game plays like a slow dominion : the main reason is the lack of getting more cards into your hand, except for one player with the queen  and one player with another card where you can get 2 extra cards. So it's very difficult to get the right combination in your hand. Maybe the start for experienced players is better. In my first play I had 4 of 6 cards with food on it. I couldn't get an extra card because I hadn't any gold. And my first attack went wrong; so I had a long game of struggling in the back. 
If I play it again it would be with the experienced start : THerefore, I will give it a second chance

RATING: 4
UPDATE: Played the 2-player game and it clocked in at 2.5 hours, with the last 45 minutes occurring after the endgame conditions were active. And it loses a lot of its interesting decisions when played with just two. Man, what a mess. From 8 to 6 on the last update. Now down to a 4.

UPDATE: The gameplay has not changed much since my previous play. This time, I had a chance to play 4 players. Yes, it solves the '3-player problem'. But the game goes on far too long for my tastes. 60 minutes is an absurd underestimate. We played for 4 hours! Even with 4 experienced players, I can't imagine it being less than a 1.5-hour game. I'm interested in trying the 2-player game to see if it would shorten it enough to hit a sweet spot. I do like a lot of the underlying skeleton, though.


OLD COMMENT: A good, but imbalanced cross between A Few Acres of Snow and A Study in Emerald.

This is a multiplayer game that uses deckbuilding for expansion, invasion, and civilization building on a map. Victory points are obtained for fulfilling standard objectives (conquering new provinces, building within one's provinces) and game-variable objectives.

The number of potential actions on a turn was a bit overwhelming, in a similar way to Mage Knight, but with longer-term implications. In future plays, the confusion should dissipate, and a rich variety of choices should be left behind.

The game-variable cards that can be purchased and added to one's deck are not equally viable, especially because there is no player-controlled costing. Thus, the best ones will always be purchased first. GOING FIRST IS A HUGE BENEFIT.

Initial player provinces are randomized, which could lead to imbalanced starting positions. Hopefully, there is a "balanced" setup included in the game. This could also be easily houseruled to draft initial provinces.

The three-player game suffers from the same problem of many three-player direct conflict games. The player who stays out of confrontation has a large advantage. This is probably best as a four-player game.

[b]Ultimately, the gameplay is quite entertaining. Many rich, layered decisions to be made within a robust and game-variable system. With a better balancing of the purchasable cards and played only as a four-player game, I think this game could be an 8 and potentially a 10.[/b]

RATING: 6
Great game, played the game once and really enjoy the mix of deckbuilding and a map, the fantasy theme aside this is not a straight copy like trains. Each game the victory conditions change and so does your initial position. This really ads up to the replay value. 

The components have hits and misses. The gameboard and cards are nice but the tokens are one sided. This make it a pain to find the right peace. All are of the same shape and that is stupid. Its a cheap production compared to fantasy flight games for example.

The game doesn't really work at 3 better on 2 or 4. Some of the victory condition is uninspiring. They are basically do x and get Y points. There is a missed opportunity there. I thing the few acres of snow theme suits the mechanics of the game better since it feels more like you are a general moving units and commanding thing than managing an mediaeval/viking kingdom. Some people will hate the slooow build up for war and that the game features delayed actions that you start and finish on later turns. The engine building is interesting and you have great amount of freedom. The map easily get cluttered and the names on the regions are little bit silly.

The game feels incomplete. Compare this game to trains and the shortcomings is apparent. the theme is badly implemented. If this was the first generation of deckbuilding I would be more forgiving as it is there is so much more that could have been done in this game. The point scoring is bland, the delayed battles and end game conditions anticlimactic building up your engine gamy. I wanted to like this game but its not worth the time investment when there are better games out there. Defeating a dragon for example just doesnt feel like defeating a dragon, it would had been much nicer if you acquired a card doing that for example... I feel Wallice needs to playtest and develop his games more before releasing them. There are great ideas in the game though.

This game checks many boxes for me.  A euro that has some light wargame/conflict, area control, tons of replayability with variable card openings.  Only marred by a game ending that takes a bit long.  Easy house rule fix and you have a really classic game.  One of Wallace's best in awhile.

A great game much better than it's bargain bin price tag.  Only played at three players which I suspect would be best count.  The variable card set up makes it highly replayable.  Can be a bit rough sometimes with unfavourable set ups and big points swings for losing or winning battles.  I do like the combat resolution which can last for several turns until a battle is actively ended.
Always liked A Few Acres of Snow ignoring HH, this makes a good companion to it.

Less engaging than A Few Acres of Snow and more king-making in the 4-player game (Being essentially barred from attacking either of the two lead players because the other one will just end the game on their action...)  Also, typical Martin Wallace rules ambiguities and unpolished game development.  There are very cool concepts in here with the "Reserve" and the Province cards, and as your territory grows you become less efficient at certain types of action, etc.  Eventually this system will yield a great game... but this one isn't it.

RATING: 3
Glad I tried this before buying ... as I won't be.

Not my type of game at all, a few acres of snow was vastly superior.

Board and components are drab - theme is so pasted on you can see the glue, why not theme it as an ancient civ game? Map looks almost like the Mediterranean, but no instead we get a generic fantasy theme with silly region names.

But my main problem is it just feels underdeveloped - the end game is very disappointing. You end it if you can win at the start of your turn, so it degenerates into a bash the current leader to stop them winning (and ending it).

Might be ok with 2, any more than that I'll avoid like the plague.

Possible end game variant - when the 4th VP pile is empty, place a black die with a 1 pip in front of that player.  After their next turn, roll a white die.  If it's less than or equal to the pip showing, the game is over immediately, otherwise increase the pip on the black die by 1.  rinse and repeat.

RATING: 3
I am rating this a 3, but with the possibility of going up to anything with a newer version/rules update. I have nothing against Martin Wallace, in fact I think games like Brass are excellent innovative games but there are some serious design flaws in this game. "The leader can declare game end" - even just reading this without playing sounds retarded, a a disaster in the making which was confirmed by our first playing.  We had to actually call our first game off as a draw as it literally would not end. Whenever someone was in the lead, the other 2 would invade one of his territories to stop him triggering the win.  After 4 hours we still had not finished. A game where rough edges and kingmaking stand tall and have to be redeemed by strong situationally aware gamers to auto-calibrate the game. Not my idea of fun. The combat also seems unsatisfying and bland, no dice, no cards and no thrill. Slow and tedious. You just keep loading up turn after turn until either your opponent cannot match you and you declare the win or he counters you with troops or the silly diplomat card. Then regardless, both sides automatically all die and VPs are handed out. The game however has some very clever systems, most notably the card mechanic. When all is said and done however the game was not satisfying for me and I would not play again as written. Its sad as if the game was properly playtested and designed it would be a solid game with a lot going for it. Perhaps a re-release/rules update or version 2 would be the solution. The game cannot be recommended and is broken/unplayable in its current format.

60-minute play time?  Only if you have players who are deliberately trying to lose. Expect a 4-player game to be 2 hours at least.

Stalemates and quagmires can develop very easily; I think experienced players will be able to recognize a losing situation and cut their losses, but less-skilled players probably will find themselves trapped in an interminable and hellish situation.

That all having been said --- I suck at deck-building games, and this deck in this game was by far the easiest for to manage.  So that's good.

RATING: 7
:sugar: :( :D :) :D I wrote a whole review of this one; this is the TL;DR:

It took a lot of the context and flavor out of A Few Acres of Snow, which is one of the things that made me so fond of that game despite the, you know, Thing. That's bad!

Partially as a knock-on effect of taking out that context and flavor, it managed to fix the glaring hole in AFAOS. That's good!

It took the concept of a board-based deckbuilding wargame and made it a viable game for more than two players that still doesn't take an excessive amount of time. That's good!

In doing this, it introduced a problematic endgame that sometimes devolves into cyclical leader-bashing, especially with four players. That's bad!

It has a bit more game-to-game variety (because the VP criteria, starting locations, and available buffs are partly randomized) than AFAOS. That's good!

The randomization sometimes just friggin' gifts you advantages that other players don't get. That's bad!

I like Mythotopia and would heartily recommend it as a deckbuilding game with real depth and strategy (as opposed to the straightforward bash than many deckbuilders end up being), not to mention as a more interesting alternative to straightforward dudes-on-a-fantasy-map titles like Small World. But it's a good game whose design compromises (necessary as they may have been) perhaps prevented this from becoming the great game it could have been.

RATING: 9.5
This doesn't feel as much like building an engine as some other deck builders, but the way you use the cards in combination with the board play is interesting. I very much like the way wars are played out; in that it's deterministic but it allows for slowly upping the ante and sometimes just deciding it's not worth all the actions you may be burning. Also, interestingly the more provinces you get the less often you get specific province cards to use for building or invasion; almost imitating bureaucracy of running a larger kingdom. Lots of interesting choices to be had. I jumped my rating up on my second play from 8.8 to 9.5. My only complaint at this point would be that many of the cards have inadequate text on them, so I'm planning on either slipping better text into card sleeves with the cards or marking on the cards which ones you should look up in the book. Example would be the Army Reserves card, that says you can't be invaded if you're already at war, but the book text says you also can't invade when you're already at war, no notation on the card to indicate there's more to it. Card should of said "Can only be engaged in one war with another player at a time."

RATING: 9.6
This is a great mixture of mechanisms. Deck building is about optimizing your cards, but here many cards are associated to map provinces, and determines what actions you can do in those provinces. So you should be very carefull about removing cards. The pace is slow, and perhaps it will not like to all gamers, but tension grows progresively, so I think it works if you like strategic games and love to see in future for preparing your plan. Any action in Mythotopia has hard consecuences that advance the story. I think it has the good from chess without the bad: each game is different thanks to initial objective cards and special cards. Played with two.

Update: More playing and better. I see that when we know all cards and provinces, playing time is lower and game funnier.

Update: More playing. This is a very satisfactory STRATEGY game. Actions are important in development of the narrative arc. I like that the most when playing. It is a pity that cover is so coring and amateurish and the end game don't like to most people, because there is a little design marble here. 9.4 -> 9.6

Rating after one partial play, so rating is officially tentative, but things don't look promising.

There's a couple interesting bits, with physical fleets you can place on the map to help with movement and combat, along with the ability to improve your maximum reserve size through construction.

But overall I thought the game was just...bland. The special cards didn't feel all that special, the actions weren't all that interesting, and there wasn't a lot of tension. The drab board didn't help, either. Many folks have already commented on the problems with the end game.

For all its problems, [i]A Few Acres of Snow[/i] at least provided an interesting historical situation that really appealed to a lot of people. That's completely missing here. I get that MW was probably fed up with the consimworld neckbeards, but it comes with the territory for any sort of historical wargame. Just realize that they're a distinct, if annoying, minority. If you're going to go the fantasy route for a wargame, you really need to come up with a rich backstory ala [i]Swords & Sorcery[/i] and this game doesn't have one.

I may have liked this game more 5 years ago.  But nowadays I don't like the whole "Lets you and him fight" strategy.  This game makes it tough on the players who get involved attacking one another.  They can waste valuable actions just upping one another.  So assuming that all players are smart enough not to attack other players, the player with the initial setup most advantageous with the initial goals will be the favored player.  This was the island points in our game.  Those 2 players finished 1st and 2nd.  Also, I don't like how there are so many cards to choose from at the beginning of the game.  A pet peeve of mine.  I see why they do it and understand why some might like this game.  I don't think I'd be willing to get in another game...thus a 3.   If this were played as a 2 player game, I think I'd up it to a 5.

[thing=133632]Mythotopia [/thing] is a great game, right up till the last round.  Then Martin Wallace appears to have rushed the game out before he had found a resolution to end the game.  As it is in the rules it does not work as it could yield a situation where the game just goes on and on, as you have to be winning at the start of your turn for the game-end to be triggered, and everyone will work to prevent that during the round.  But ways of overcoming this don’t work either, and clearly Mr.Wallace found this too, so the rules as written were better than any of the other options he had.  

But that aside, the game is excellent and really takes deck building to a new level in multi-player, as did A Few Acres of Snow for 2 player.  I understand that [thing=197320][/thing] takes the essence of this game and creates a better end-game experience.  I have the game but have not yet played it.

everything was good about this until our last play when someone told another player that they had the win on board if they did something.  I guess it would have gone back and forth for a while but the trick is multiple fronts.

The successor to A Few Acres of Snow, with the historical ties removed and the option to play with 2-4 players. The general fantasy theme is very mild and the province names are just hilarious to read aloud. The randomized placement, objectives and skill cards make for a different game each time. Limited Edition pieces look really nice by the end of game. Definitely needs some house rules for endgame scoring, as the game ran unnecessarily long.

The deck building element didn't resonate with me. It is one thing to not draw enough of a resource between rounds (that comes with the mechanics territory), but needing to also draw a card to perform a desired action is irritating. The game is well put together and moves quickly which is a plus. It does suffer from a clunky visual design, and for me, I find the board a jumbled mess to look at.

Deckbuilding related to board activities is my favorite setting. The gameflow felt a little bit slow in our first game. Otherwise this game is nicely made. I don' t like to fight other players directly.

I enjoyed this game. Interesting to see the AFAOS formula in another game.

I can see how the end game complaints could come up, but it didn't happen in our game.

edit: Second play did confirm that the ending is a bit strange. In a 4 player game, someone can easily make a move to let another player win. Sort of a weird thing.

I am done, done, DONE with Martin Wallace and his tedious half-baked bullshit designs. 

One 2p game and that was enough. Zero arc, constant back-and-forth game of inches with each player largely at the whim of their cards, merely working to end the game...FOR HOURS AND HOURS! And there's no way more players would solve any of the problems.

This adds nothing to the 2p Few Acres design and only makes it worse. In Few Acres you start on opposite sides of the board. Only in mid to late game is there any real direct confrontation, and generally not much flipping. It's more of a race. Mythotopia puts you in immediate proximity so it's just fighting from start to "finish"

Wallace made one cool game years ago called Age of Steam and he's been running on fumes ever since.

Provisional rating which will be revisited once the dust settles around the enigmatic Reserve Army card.  As it stands right now, it may lead to odd game situations favouring a runaway leader.  I am also concerned that since an autowin condition is absent, there is a potential for a rotating bash the leader endgame.  This is something which brings back distant and unpleasant memories from the 80's, an experience I am not too keen to revisit.  This being said, this is not a problem at all in a 2 player setting.  I enjoy the mechanics and game flow very much, and I am more than willing to challenge my first impression.

Saying it's Dominion with a board is a lie. It's an area control game with a smothering of Dominion-ish deckbuilding on top. So that disappointed me, as I'm not massively fond of area control games, and it really was't what I was expecting. Also... sort the rulebook out! I can tolerate one missed word, but 3 errors, one being a misprint on how many starting cards you should have? C'mon, that's just terrible...

Eléggé hasonlít a működése a study in emeraldhoz (a few acres of snowhoz állítólag még jobban, de azt nem ismerem :)). Elég összetett és agyégető a játékmenet, nem kevés konfrontációval. Ügyesen segít ezen az, hogy a kezünkben lévő kártyák jelentősen korlátozzák a lehetőségeinket, így nem kell minden döntésben megszakadni. Az én ízlésemhez mérten kicsit talán túl hosszadalmas és túl konfrontatív, de összességében nem rossz játék, kiváló, egyedi (a szerző rokonjátékait nem számítva) mechanizmusokkal.

Deck-building plus board game in one.  Your actions are based on the cards from your deck which represent either resources/provinces or special actions.   As you gain territory on the map, you gain more cards into your deck.  Standard deckbuilding consideration for thinning vs optimization exists but with the additional consideration for taking actions on the map.

With high expectations we went into our first 4-player game. After 4 hours of play the game finally ended leaving us behind kind of unsatisfied. I really enjoyed every single one of my over 50 plays of "Acres" but I feel a little confused about Mythotopia. Playing time is way too long and game end conditions, with the presumably winner to declare his victory as an action, seems kind of dumb to me. IMHO this just makes the whole game longer than it should be. I guess playing time would drop with more plays but I can't hardly see playing this one under 2.5 hours with 4 players. I can't tell what it is, but over all something seems to be missing here. Maybe it is the missing historical background or the pasted on and in fact non-existing theme or just the silly names of the provinces. But other then "Acres" this one just didn't grab me on my first play. Probably I'll give it at least one more shot, but Mythotopia will not hit the table as often as I expected it would, I'm afraid.

Like a cross between Wallenstein and Dominion, with the battle system from A study of Emerald, this has more payer on player attacks than in our usual gaming line up.

Good deck building, area control, wargame. The deck building is limited but works along the lines of Dominion (add card with your desired abilities and cycle them through your deck and discard pile) and possibly Race for the Galaxy (use cards for it's ability or as currency). Lots of "objectives" adds variety to the play but also makes it fiddly and ultimately samey. 

Based on the mechanics of A Few Acres of Snow but accommodates 2 to 4 players which is good. The rules are clear but possibly a few more examples would have been good.

Components are functional and good quality but the art is just OK - possibly a missed opportunity to have "wowed" up the art to ramp up the theme.

Overall good.

A very interesting Deck Building - Area Control game (with a little bit of war). I like the theme of fantasy warlords struggling for power. A really cool thing are variable goals (random goal cards). While random setup might severly impact balance, it also means that each time player starts with different challenges and strengths.

I would like a second edition to push the score towards the 8star review I would like to give.

This is a great distillation of what Wallace did right the first time in A Few Acres of Snow. The first game in a while I'm Eagre (sorry) to play again back to back. 

I stand in contrast to others who don't like the setting. Adding a bunch of chrome relating to orcs or wyverns or dingoes would have sunk this game--its quirky simplicity is a boon here, and not a bane. 

Likewise, everyone in your group can agree after one or two plays that the end game is broken. That is not the conclusion our group has reached after around 10 plays. Nonetheless, it's easily house ruled, and shouldn't detract from what is a uniqely smooth and fun set of game mechanisms. Highly recommended.

If you are looking at Mythotopia expecting A Few Acres of Snow v.3.0 then move on.  This game does not live up to its heritage although it makes some noteworthy improvements with the Reserve card management and separation of military units from the cards used to play them.    

The thing that hurts this game the most is that the end of game is fiddly at best.  I have not experienced any of the issues others have with games dragging out but the 'end game' action is very quirky and awkward to reach depending on what victory cards are available in a game.

Like many Wallace designs, this needed a good developer to trim some fat. It's a definite improvement over A Few Acres of Snow--more open, more dynamic, and a great variety of cards. The need to trim your deck well--but not too well!--is a fascinating balancing act.
Having played with two, I can definitely imagine how the endgame would have serious problems multiplayer. Must investigate variants.

As many others before, this game tries to use deckbuilding in a bigger game, but as many oithers before, it didn't work out too great. There are some nice ideas as usual, but the gameplay itself is rather boring and extremely repetetive. It takes way too long aswell.

Not really bad, but nothing people will remember.

RATING: 6
This game is okay. It plays very much like other deckbuilders, in that a large part of the skill is assessing which cards will make a good engine at the start of the game. The limits on army chips makes timing of ending or drawing out conflicts interesting. The actions and what needs cards and what doesn't is very messy though - it's a real challenge at the start to remember what you need to play to do what. Having only one build card makes the building element feel oddly sparse as well, considering building is the always available win condition. There's a lack of drama in the game, good hands are never amazing, and battles are number counting contests. It makes for a game where tactical choices are clear and interesting to make, but don't have much emotional payoff. I'd play this again, but I don't think it's one I'll pull out often.

I didn't feel the endgame had any problems like people have been saying, we played a 3 player game in just over an hour.

Great game, mechanic wise.

He kept the base mechanics from A few acres of snow & put it on a multiplayer map. Additionally Walace added some random winning VP goals plus random assortment of purchasable deckbuilding cards.. very good decisions.

Alas a theme he did not include.. the game is very bland.. Mythotopia, the land of generic & rather silly fantasy names like Kakaphyree & Drab..
Who are you..? No idea.. no name or even a picture of which nation you're representing.. real shame. A good theme would've done so much for this otherwise very cool game.

Ending condition seemed a bit long, but that will probably change once everyone really knows what strategies there are to pursue.

So although i like it & will probably continue playing it, i can't fight the feeling that with a proper thematic overlay something epic could have've been created here.. maybe i'm the minority, and the masses would shy away from anything less generic? Only time will tell.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

I hated the box art, disliked the generic fantasy theme, and to be honest only picked it up because I loved [i]"London"[/i] and had only heard good things about the game-play of [i]"A Few Acres of Snow"[/i] (both Martin Wallace classics). I`m so very glad I did!

[i]"Mythotopia"[/i] is an absolutely enthralling game of long-term strategy, carefully planned conflict, and puzzling out your hand of cards. The spacial elements of the board really add a lot to the basic concept of deck-building. 
You find yourself heavily defending certain territories based on three factors; your opponent's location, the importance of the resource that the territory provides, and the strategic position of the territory for achieving available victory point conditions. 
Every game is unique, and every single hand of cards is a joy to solve. 

However, there are few game-play choices by the designer that have met with some backlash. And while I understand the frustration, I thought I would try to alleviate some of the concerns here:

[i]1.[/i] Drawn-out endgame: Once all of the end game conditions have been met, the game can definitely drag out if players are tied in points. Personally I think this only happens when learning the game, as there are so many ways around this. There are multiple Improvement cards that can score you extra points to put you in the lead. Also, if you plan your strategy well, you will have several conflicts going at once by the end game and should be able to nudge ahead in several at once on a turn that will allow you to initiate the end game in your favor on the next turn.  

[i]2.[/i] Never-ending conflicts: It's okay to lose conflicts!!!! Especially as the attacker. People definitely get their testosterone pumping when a conflict starts up, and you will often see piles of soldiers piled-up, neither side willing to give in. This is particularly bad in a 3-4 player game as someone else is just getting a ton of free actions every turn. But remember, they have to spend a whole action to "end the war", time you can spend initiating another conflict, building a road so you can initiate another conflict in the same region next turn, or just focusing on getting some more victory points from the cards before they're all gone. 

[i]3.[/i] No military to get a conflict off to a good start: If you want to go all in on a big military push, be sure to reserve a ton of military cards on one turn so you can combine them with your new hand on the next. Or just keep them in reserve for a stronger defense. 

All in all, I now love the box art for its uniqueness, the generic fantasy setting for allowing me to forge my own empire there as I imagine it, and Martin Wallace for creating another game I couldn't imagining living without. (^_^)

[i]F.Y.I[/i] You MUST MUST MUST draft the territory cards at the start of the game or at least make sure new players have a healthy helping of all resource types or they could seriously have a bad first-time experience with the game. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The connection between the cards and their territories is fascinating. 
- The various Improvement Cards and Victory conditions in each game are always exciting to pursue. 
- The puzzle of the cards and the "ah-ha" moments in conflicts are stellar. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Mastering some of the mechanisms, especially timing and whether to give up on a war or not is tricky. 
- The generic theme and okay artwork will be a detractor for some.

RATING: 5.2
Still unsure about this game, I really like and enjoy the deck building mechanic and trying to produce an efficient engine, and that seems to work ok.

However currently the downsides of the game seem to have more impact.

There seems to be some very powerful and unbalanced cards with not many counters (the one that came up recently was Reserve Army, which seems very hard to actually hurt the guy who is playing it).

Overall it feels that if you try and have a reasonable start and edge a lead gradually you're not going to win, as are likely to be hit from multiple sides and lose a lot of points from territories going to other players. the key seems to be stay at the back, build up slowly then wipe up the mess when others are locked into heavy fought battles.

I think there is probably a lot more to learn and the game could be higher rated, but the rules aren't fully clear at times so it doesn't assist itself in feeling good, there also seems a lot of improvement cards that seem overpowered and you need to be aware of them and all players need to know how to play around them.

Takes longer than 60min with 4 players (3 were new but it still took 3 hours)

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2015)

To me, A Few Acres of Snow is a good game and also, I think Wallace is a great game designer (although I really hate his light games) so I was expecting a lot from Mythotopia. After reading the rules, the game seemed interesting enough, but after I played it I have some misgivings.

The art and components are ok, although the towns tokens and city tokens are very similar so we confused them a lot. It has a fantasy theme, but I don’t feel it. Playtime is way longer than advertised.

Mythohopia uses the same idea of A Few Acres of Snow, but with some changes. Most of them for the best I think. For example I like how the reserve is used, the benefit cards, the “reserve only” cards, the goal cards, the variable setting and the way armies are deployed and used is great. However I have a big issue with the way he handled the improvement cards. Now you have only ONE of each which makes the game very unfair to me. I dislike deckbuilding games in which I cannot buy what I want because another player got it first due to the random sitting order. Also I feel some of the cards are overpowered, the card Levy is WAY too powerful as conquering and defending provinces are the best VP generator in the game while stone and gold aren’t that important. 

I’m not sure yet what is the best number of players. I would love to play it only as a two player game, but in that instance, it seems, a player can dominate the other military. The problem as I see it is that some provinces give military power, so if the stronger player attacks the military provinces of the other player, we get a situation in which the richer get richer and no matter what the other player does, he will lose. I need to play more to see if this is true. I guess this can be solved/balanced playing a 4 player game (not a 3 player game), but in that case the downtime would be excessive for me AND I think a “bash the leader” situation would develop. I’m not sure which is worse.

Mythotopia offers very interesting choices, you have a ton to choose from and only two actions per turn (you can build something, score Vps, attack, move armies, defend, end a war, end the game, buy a card, discard cards, destroy cards). I really like this but as there are a lot to consider, the downtime also grows a lot with more than 2 players.

The luck factor inherent in the setup (random provinces for the players a la Risk) can bother me, as some players begin with a definitive advantage, also in our game the goal card Lord of the Seas appeared and one player won those points right in the setup before the game even began.

Bottom line, I think Mythotopia is inferior game than A Few Acres of Snow because I really hate how the Improvement cards are handled (just one per game), so going first is a huge advantage and very unfair in my book. I will give it more chances to woe me as, in general, the game has lots of things going for it.

One play only, which went down well with all 4 players - of which I was the only one who'd played its patent game A Few Acres of Snow. Mikko thought it the best deck-builder he'd played.

Deck building with a purpose (other than just improving your deck and grabbing VP points in the end-game). The board play is good and the variable starting positions and improvement cards are likely to give it legs.

Feels underdeveloped. Some things felt rushed and arbitrary. The deck building aspect is too slow, and never builds to I'm doing powerful things. Pacing feels wrong.

Deck building at it's core is start out slow, and build to a crescendo like a good rock song, this doesn't have that, it feels more like a turtle deciding to come out, then changing his mind.

The board is a little drab and the green player has to deal with green food markers everywhere on the board which can be confusing.  REGARDLESS - this is an even handed battle wherein seemingly helping one player to avoid another getting an advantage can also backfire!  Both strategic but mostly tactical.

The first half of the game (claiming territories and objectives) is enjoyable. But the second half of the game where the leader tries to claim the win by defending against all opponents is a slog.

Initial 8. 4-player game with random locations set-up is a mistake. I got mainly food provinces which rendered my starting position and rest of the game very weak. Card-drafting variant for starting provinces should fix this. 4-player game also felt to drag a bit. I would like to see expansion to make it more snapy. Currently it seems it is much better with less players.

----
Moving it a point higher. The second game with province cards drafting was much better. It still feels kind of slow and in the middle of the game it felt pointless when I was down with so many point. Then I got my deck optimized for military and I went full blitzkrieg and took a very close win. So I am very satisfied with it.

The end game still feels weird and constant counting of points feels out of place. I'd rather play it as war game, without counting points, but I guess it is hard to do.

----
Nah, it's a 10. Very tight game. Like it a lot. More 1 vs 1, though, but works equally well with more.

---

Final rating is 8. If miscalculation happens in deck-optimization, then it's instant game over.

I'd much rather play A Few Acres of Snow despite it being "broken". A Few Acres of Snow has a great theme which is well implemented and interesting deckbuilding choices. Mythotopia has no theme at all and very limited deck building options which become even less when playing with more players. Multiplayer also adds a very annyoing end game of ganging up whoever is ahead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I spent pretty much my whole first game struggling against the inertia of the setup. There was also surprisingly little player interaction going on; the few times a player-owned area was attacked, it was never contested. Clearly the game can turn out very differently depending on the selection of goals and draft cards, but I would have to play again to find whether the deckbuilding model itself can offer a significantly more rewarding experience. My second game was more "normal" in some respects, but action efficiency is still decided by the luck of the draw, and the endgame at least partially by the luck of the bash.

Downgraded the rating from 8 to a 6, good game but still has its flaws, has a great beginning and ending but the middle stage is rather boring and it takes 2-3-4 hours to complete depending on players strategy. Didnt have fun while playing it and this was also the opinion of my co players. 
========================
this looks great! played it with my 13 year old son and we liked it a lot! I m glad that I got rid the broken [thing=79828][/thing] because when I read that this was coming it was my only hope! Besides that I didn't liked the history frame also, so a fantasy one was more welcomed. The map artwork is extremely functional and the relaxing colors are awesome! the cards artwork is great too but it has the worst cover box artwork I have ever seen! As a 2 player game I don't think that it is that good but as a 3 or 4 it will shine!

This is a great game based on A Few Acres Of Snow. It's Wallace's attempt (I think) to make a MP version of AFAoS but in truth plays best at two. Deck-building, hand management, area control, war at an abstract strategic level: a mash-up of Risk, Diplomacy and GMT wargames, this to me has the GMT/ COIN experience with none of the fiddly rules overhead. But then I'm not a wargamer. So maybe best described as a euro in camouflage.

RATING: 7
Comments based on first play through. It's a fun game - a smash up of a deck builder and an area control game. 

Rules are a little complicated at times - at least we missed a bunch of things in our first run through.

The combat is interesting - the way you try to overwhelm a location.

I really liked the 'reserve' card mechanic where you save them until some future time you need them.

The theme is generic fantasy and adds nothing to the game.

I think the definitive "deck building on a map" -game hasn't been made yet, but Mythotopia is a good effort. The deck building element is simple and complex enough at the same time, what happens on the map matters and there is plenty of room for clever (and aggressive) playing. However Mytotopia isn't without its faults. The most obvious is that the game doesn't have any kind of a timer to end it(!). It simply relies on players to do certain things which lea to the game ending - and it's not difficult to see that sometimes these things aren't going to get done, which means that the game will keep going on and on and on.

Martin Wallace, deck building meets dudes on a map (disclaimer: I still haven't played A Few Acres of Snow). It's not bad at all, and even though I don't play nearly as many Wallace games as I'd like I always get the feel there is some Knizian quality to his games (and I do find some Knizian mechanism elements as well). This time the endgame condition comes from many Knizias, namely (after tokens from 4 cards were taken - which is like a nod to the original endgame conditions of Dominion) you can end the game only if at the beginning of your turn you are in a winning position. This endgame condition makes Mythotopia very tense in the later turns. So the game has some Knizian features (including a not very thematic feel) and it works okay – but I really like games played on a map which is a plus to me.

Fun combination of deckbuilding and area-control.

Blinged out the components with wooden pieces similar to the limited edition. Standard Catan stuff for villages, cities, citadels and boats. The green player got all black parts. Castles are big grey cubes and dragons, runestones and mercenaries use various sorts of meeples. Armies, roads and VP are still basic cardboard chits from the box (found mixing wood and cardboard help distinguish elements better visually).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After a video review: Inspired by a few acres of snow mechanics, it's a deck building conquest game. The deck building mechanism is weird and can be confusing because each action has different requirements.

Since you have 2 actions per turn only, the game will suffer from beign not proportional to empire size. But then again, most board games has that problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game has potential to drag in the end game as one jostles for control (unless people lose track of what is necessary to stop people from winning).  It works nicely until that moment.  Not sure if the endgame concern is a dealbreaker at this time - willing to give it a couple more plays before making that final decision.  It is likely a game that will be more enjoyable with experienced players.  I do not mind the tit for tat aspect but getting involved in a long, drawn out battle is usually a recipe for disaster.  Often, one is better off just losing the battle to continue to fight the war.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very good and engaging game for most of the gameplay but the endgame devolved into a bunch of bash the leader, then the new leader until someone managed to pop up with the ability to win on his turn.  Interesting game with a rather gamey and unsatisfying end.

I have not played A Few Acres of Snow.  But Mythotopia blends the Euro mechanic and deck building with a war game in an elegant way.  There are a number of different victory conditions and every game will have different cards for purchase.  

It has a "builder" strategy as well as an attack strategy.  I really liked this game and am keen to get it to the table again.

After only one game (incomplete to boot, since I run out of steam and desire to complete it) it feels like this game has a number of serious problems:  1) Until you are very familiar with the game and have some ways to manipulate it, the game plays you instead of you playing the game.  Too much is determined by the random drawings of your deck.  I enjoy games with an element of luck when it supplements rather than replace opportunities for decision making.  In this game too many times it feels like your choices and what you do is determined by your deck, which strides with the strategic board play. 2)  Not enough depth to warrant gaining expertise.  One senses that perhaps some of the problems with the first play could be resolved through knowledge and experience of the ways to manipulate the randomness factor, but the game itself is not interesting enough to stimulate me to do that; 3) length -- I found myself wanting to hurry up the end game condition and desperate that it was still too far -- that is usually a sign of something wrong to the game, when you worry it won't end soon enough, it means it's not engaging enough.  4) Too much repetitiveness.  Without asymmetries (like its sibling A Few Acres of Snow) and with limited actions (in spite of the long list there are only some basic things one does over and over again) that don't have weight, impact, or consequences, it gets repetitive soon.  Art/theme -- generic and bland.

I was looking forward to trying this out, mainly due to my hope that using A Few Acres of Snow as a starting point might increase the chance of a well-developed game. The rulebook was a first hint that my optimism was unfounded. Apart from actively obstructing a proper grasp of how to play, a shopping list of more than a dozen different action options is usually not a sign of a well-tuned game.

Our first game initially went fine once it got underway, but the final turns confirmed a suspicion that had been steadily rising all the time: the transfer of a combat system from a pure dueling game to a multi-player game without significant changes is, at least in my opinion, a fatal flaw. Extended wars are crippling for both sides and introduce a level of kingmaking and bash-the-leader that seems like a throwback to the Dark Ages of  boardgaming (i.e. the 80ies).

In summary, this feels like an undercooked mess to me, and I should probably resign to the fact that Wallace’s games without external development are just not for me.

Did not like this one with 3 players.  Scott and I got into a many-turn war that let Eric take the lead.  I started pulling back up to Eric but got sick of the game and just worked towards ending it so we could play something else.  This game might be better with 2 players.  It felt a lot like Shogun, another Martin Wallace game, despite the mechanics differences.

Deck building plus area control with a twist. A natural progression from A Few Acres of Snow (reserving cards, conquest to build deck) and Study in Emerald (deck collection via conquering), and Discworld (end game mechanic). Really interesting end game mechanism, with the game continuing until when a player can claim victory at the start of their turn. Forces one to attack the king to keep the game going, with the hope of positioning oneself to grab victory.

Very keen to play again. Andrew has a copy, so no need for me to own it.

Deck building with a board. Martin Wallace was the first to invent that in AFAS. This game follows the same mechanism and has plenty of variability added to make sure that there can never be a broken strategy in this game. The game is fun to play. Deckbuilding dominion style, but with a reserve where you can "park" cards for use in future turns. This adds a littlebit of planning, but mostly this is a tactical game, not strategic. It is not very heavy, but is just fun to play. Grab land, points go up and down etc.

I dislike this game.  Greatly.  Why?

Generic mechanics.  Large option set all of which is mechanical in feeling.  Like twisting knobs and pulling levers.  No theme and no soul.  battles wage in a simplified way that depends on the luck of the draw rather than the weight of thought towards where you think it is best to deploy resources.   In other words, though you may have a strategy in mind, the cards that you draw into your hand define what can actually be done.  So with invasion or defense this strategy once launched is sacrificed to happenstance.  

Lots of negativity around end game set up, but honestly, once you make it that far you've lost all caring anyway about the game.  Who cares?  Worst of blends between euro and interactive game with the instant gratification and tradition of deckbuilding the only thing keeping some people interested in this game.  but not me.

RATING: 5.3
If you look past the pasted on "mythological" theme, there is a good, solid area control game with plenty of conflict underneath. I like the deck building mechanic which was used in a Few Acres of Snow and translates well to this game.
What lets Mythotopia down so very badly is the ending of the game - where only a player who would win the game can end it. Not only does this lead to unwarranted "kill the leader" tactics but also you need to evaluate all ongoing battles to see if their result would change the leader! The first issue results in drawing out what was until that point a good game; the latter issue is just pure poor design as there can be many battles ongoing (even more so due to the first issue)!
Unless someone develops a different end game (any fans out there willing to develop one?), I will not be playing this again.

Definitely has a nice card system, but that's where the positives end.  

The game end is terribly implemented and overstays its welcome by 60 mins or more.  What's worse, however, is the ability of each player to "turn on a dime" and completely reverse course on their strategy with no downside.  Essentially this makes the game into a "pick on the leader" exercise which is quite tedious.

Ships, as well as some cards, are overpowered as well.  "Warping" armies here and there at will makes no sense and detracts from gameplay.

This game needed more time in development and it could have been something really special.  But as it stands it cannot be enjoyed, even partially, without house rules and variants... Something which is completely unnecessary with so many other gaming options available.

Cosa c'è? C'è che il gioco non decolla, non appassiona. Le poche partite che ho fatto sono state un accaparrarsi di carte ai primi turni e poi cercare di svilupparle. Inoltre le azioni sono vincolate dalla mano delle carte che si pescano e, le azioni di costruzioni, ma soprattutto di battaglia, sono un dispendio di carte importante. In sostanza non ho quasi mai trovato vantaggioso dedicarsi alle battaglie e più ancora alla difesa dei territori. Trovo che il gioco non decolli ma risulti troppo lento.

Bland Game that really didn't work for us and would never choose to play it again.  The silly names on the board had us laughing AT the game.  General artwork was functional but nothing special and again, very bland.

Got no feeling of any theme at all, was just complete abstract, moving pieces and trying to get a higher number - and that was pretty much the whole game.  It was just lacking in... well, everything.

The wooden pieces in the limited edition were nice though, except the VP counters - I thought they looked a bit cheap.  Silver paint with a printed black number off centre.

I also feel a bit more attention to detail on certain things like the player aid would have helped.  Having a list of all the actions is useful, but there should have been at least some icons to show "This action must be first" or "You may only do this once".

Mythotopia is a multiplayer combat game that uses a deck-building mechanic. Players control territories on the board, in which they can build walls to increase defense, cities to help with card drawing, or roads to help with movement. Attacks can also be staged on neighboring territories. Cards are used to do all of these things--the location card of the place where you're building or attacking from must be used, plus a build card and the appropriate amount of money symbols for building, or a food symbol and any number of army symbols for an attack. Additional cards can be bought that enhance all of these abilities. Usually, players refill their hands to five cards, but players can store unused cards in their reserve, where they can be used on future turns but don't count against the hand refill size. Players earn points for building the various buildings and successfully attacking others, and once a certain point in the game is reached, a player can declare victory if he has more points. The game has some interesting ideas, but ultimately multiplayer combat games aren't my style. It is really important to know what all of the cards you can purchase do, as the game presents you with all of them at once.

This game is bizarre. It's more or less a multiplayer version of AFAoS set in a fantasy realm with card drafting. It does so much to improve upon the original system which I applaud, but the end game is strange. It just kind of....ends. It also encourages picking on the leader. I enjoy the game though even with its faults. I'll have to look into some of the end game variants.

My rating may continue to rise as I play it. I've only played it with 2, so I'd be curious to see how it plays with more. I enjoyed this quite a bit more my second game as I understood the rules better and learned from my previous mistakes.

I feel like Martin Wallace designs a game that's mostly complete and leaves it up to the audience to figure out the loose ends. He did the same thing in London with the 2 player game and I feel like he did this with the end game.

Update: Having played with 3 players, I have to say it really improved the game. 2 is perfectly fine and quite enjoyable, but 3 gave some intense decisions to think about. Even though I was worried the end of the game might start to drag, it was intense the entire time as you're planning on trying to ensure you knock down the current leader while putting yourself in the lead otherwise you'll just kingmake the other person. Great fun!

Pretty good game but lacks theme almost entirely. The names of the provinces sound like they came from some random fantasy name generator (and not a very good one). The end game triggering has to be houseruled to be enjoyable. For example: after fourth card is emptied, play one more round and then the game ends. Also, victory point track should not be used at all to keep the tension, just count point chips and provinces to get the scores (and get minimum of 12 points from provinces to keep the game balance intact).

I had such high-hopes. I love A Few Acres of Snow, and a multi-player version sounded excellent. But this felt so flat to me. My deck and board position barely changed over the course of the game. It seemed that opportunities for growth or specialization are limited. It was clear in the mid-game that I couldn’t win, so I made it a personal goal to kill a dragon…it never happened.

Very nice gaming mechanisms, as we're used from Martin Wallace. Has a lot of direct player interaction as you can attack each other. Will probably suffer from pick-on-the-leader (which will make they will attack your cities if you're in the lead).

RATING: 7.5
It's got a good deal of variation. And I think it has interesting choices. It went a little long, but not overly. (Would be easy shorten it up a little; e.g. just put 1 less VP token on each of the VP cards). 

The AFAoS system is a good game engine -- AFAoS is certainly a better game, but this is a good adaptation which can accommodate more players. This certain felt sufficiently different than AFAoS such that I'd be comfortable owning both. 

I think it would excel with 4 players (that seems to be the consensus). And I think you'd want to hem the board in a bit for 3 players. Additionally, I think it would better to draft starting territories Shogun-style.

This is an area control / deck building game. 

It was not for me. I got randomly dealt non military regions and everyone else had a ton. There was not a hope in the world for me if they decided to come after me. 

I was happy to learn it but I can't say I enjoyed it. 

I will not play this one again.

RATING: 4
I wasn't super happy with this game. I could see the design influence from A Few Acres of Snow, but the charm was gone. The way this works is each player gets a certain number of random provinces at the start. You need to hope that your stuff gets clustered vaguely together, and that you have a decent spread of all the different types of resources, as each province has a card you add to your deck that produces a single type of good. At the start of the game a certain number of cards containing victory points are used. These act as the game timer, with the game ending when however many cards run out of chips. There is also an array of 16 special cards available for purchase. There is only one copy of each card and they don't replenish, so the deckbuilding portion of the game ends pretty quickly once these get snatched up. You get 3VP for each province you control plus whatever perma-points you get from the chip cards, and that's your score. We spent some time trading provinces back and forth uselessly, but the game dragged as we felt like pretty early on we couldn't effect the content and flow of our decks. In order to attack, you need the card matching the province you are attacking from, so often times our invasions of each other were more about the fact we had lined up the cards in our hand rather than the idea we were actually aiming for a specific goal. We happened to get mostly VP cards that required building, so players who happened to start more in the easier-to-fortify edge of the board brick producing areas had a big advantage. We quit mid-game. I'm not opposed to trying again with a different group, but I don't feel any particular pressure to either.

Fantasic when played with two variants:

1. Start the game by drafting provinces.
2. After 4th VP card empties, everyone immediatly shuffles their discard into their draw pile. Game continues as normal except without pass or end game actions. Game ends immediatly when someone needs to draw a card and their draw pile is empty. Resolve remaining battles and score as usual.

Best deck builder with a board that I have played. I love that the province cards are linked to the board and change hands with conquest. Tension from beginning to end. A euro with conflict that works.

If I wanted a great Euro wargame, I'd rather play Wallenstein, Shogun, or Struggle of Empires (another Martin Wallace game). If i wanted a great Euro deck builder, I'd rather play A Few Acres of Snow (another Martin Wallace game). This doesn't do anything better than another game in my collection already does, and several of these are other Martin Wallace games. The other players were pulling out their mobile phones during downtime - never a good sign. I am intending to sell this one.

At present, my favourite game from Essen 2014.  I really don't understand the two comments saying that there' son way to peg back an early leader (how about attacking him?) or that there' stop much tit-for-tat (presumably not affecting the leader somehow, to make the first comment true??)  

Some swapping of provinces early in the game isn't only inevitable, it's desirable as players "tune" their decks, losing cards that they don't need and targeting ones that they do, but players may not realise the benefit of a targeted deck-building approach until they,ve played it once or twice.

I think that this is my favourite Wallace of the last 5+ years.

Martin Wallace remakes "A Few Acres of Snow". Did he succeed? In my opinion, no.

Now don't get me wrong, there's no Halifax Hammer here. But the generic fantasy theme, the uninspired battle mechanic... For me, this game hasn't got the magic of it's predecessor. In AFAoS, Wallace managed to marry deck-building and history in an unique way. The same thing can't be said about "Mythotopia". It saddens me to say it, but it feels like a cheap rip-off.

Now, the few games we played were best with just two players. With more, it can drag horribly (see all the threads about possible end game variants). For us, it did and while some players argue that the issue disappears with experience, our impressions were so bad we didn't feel interested in learning the game in and out. So it had to go.

Excellent area control game, very thematic and with really great freedom of choice. Have played it 3 times as a 2 player game so far and works really well. Played once with 3 and there was a runaway winner. Seems that with more players (3 or 4), it lives a lot from the balance between the players. Could get chaotic with 4, maybe? Have to definetly try it with 4 and again with 3. Has the game mechanic of A Few Acres of Snow, but in a sort of more run down version, which makes it far more acessible and simple to play. Replay value is great because, apart from being the type of game that is always a little bit different depending on the situation on the board, it has a number of objectives/VP and improvment cards from which a fixed amount are randomly chosen  and come into play each game, which can make each game play and feel a lot different. Very dynamic, great game! Guess the rating will be going up with the number of plays. It´s one of those kind of games!

I really liked how the game handles deck building, resource management, card balance, map-based actions (using location tiles and the brilliant use of roads), and almost everything else.  For me, a few flaws bring down this otherwise wonderful design.

However, the game makes little or no attempt to address basic issues with multi-player wargames.  The best strategy is to not fight, but you're not entirely in control of when you fight.  Fighting is often a penny auction where the winners are the people are those not involved.

A more minor, but still irritation, issue is that the key landmarks are added after players draft locations.  Some landmarks are boons to be near and some are hindrances.  It you are stuck next to low quality neutral territories, then you sort of have to attack other players, triggering my earlier issue.

All in all, the game probably works well 2 player or in some sort of 2v2 variant.  It might have been absolutely amazing multi-player if it has taken basic measures to address the issue with multi-way conflict.  I am particularly frustrated, because I think this is a game that is a hair away from being stunning, but is instead mildly irritating.

RATING: 7
08-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. Fun deck-building meets area-control game in which you try to dominate a fantasy land. You get VPs by controlling areas, obtaining and objectives of which 3 are always in the game and 4 are randomly added.

Each area on the board corresponds with one resource-type that area generates, there are 4 resources in the game. Food, armies, stone and money. You also have 4 different action cards such as build (which allows you to build castles, roads and cities), market (contains one of each resource), army (gives you 2 armiies) and ship (which allows you to attack over sea and gives combat strength to areas adjacent to the sea space). 

Each turn, you can take two actions. One of those actions is to invade. If you want to invade, you have to play armies, 1 food (2 food in case of attacking over hills) and the area card of an adjacent area to the one you want to attack. Same for building, if you want to build a road or a castle, you have to pay the resource costs and a card where you want to build the building.

I really like the game. You need to plan carefully, but combat is deterministic and works fine. The endgame trigger of the game is a little wonky. In principe, once 4 of the 7 victory condition cards are depleted from their tokens the game can end if one player calls for the end in his turn. Unresolved combats are resolved, and the one with most VPs wins.

Another downside is the lack of a good reference sheet. While the game clearly features many abstract principles that can easily be explained, several tiny rules matter but are not easily accessible on ref sheets. Ref sheets for the game would, I think, improve the game.

After only one play - so take this with a pinch of salt - but I am suspicious of the way the end game plays out. It doesn't feel right - and in my one play was down right horrible and disappointing. Discworld and A Study in Scarlet both seem to handle end game better in the faced of similar potential issues - and it may well come down to the lack of hidden goals of some sort - with the deterministic end conditions, players are either going to be stupid, fatalistic, or else drawn into tedious bash-the-leader jockeying. 

The rest of the game was great, though, and I loved the art and the place names.

RATING: 7
A good tussle that improves many areas of A Few Acres of Snow, but at the expense of a good theme. It's a refined deck building on a board gaming experience. (I especially like the new reserve card rules and reserve card abilities.) Not one I'd like to touch with four players unless there was a game end trigger tweak - perhaps at least dropping the first action requirement for triggering the game end. With three players though it works well enough. It's fun to find a good combination of the special action cards that your opponents don't nab first. You can have a good tussle and you really just can't take it too seriously with those provide names on the board. Just for fun when I want a light conflict game that works with three.

Makes me look forward to Hands in the Sea even more. (A real theme and the improved gameplay of Mythotopia.)

I have finally played the published version! It was a 2-player game, and it works quite well! Everything played pretty smoothly, actually, except for the end game: it seemed to drag a bit as we went back and forth trying to get ahead in VP so we could end the game. It worked, but it seems there should have been a way to just end the game and then see who won? Or alternately, to easily track the virtual VP? Maybe not -- will have to try this again. Next time, though, draft or draw extra and discard; random starting provinces seem like a good way to learn the game, but that's about all!

I knew that this was not only a Martin Wallace game but a follow-up to A Few Acres of Snow within the first minute of the rules explanation.  This game borrows a lot from A Few Acres of Snow but does enough different that I actually enjoyed this much more.

This is a deck-building area-control game.  Each player starts out with a few common cards as well as the card for a few starting areas they control which each have a symbol of their own on them.  Each action in this game requires different symbols.  Building needs clay, attacking needs armies and food to feed them, purchasing needs gold, etc.  Most of the time you also need to play the card for the location involved in the action as well (we actually played this wrong our first game making builiding a LOT easier than it should have been).  The kind of unique game end condition is that once certain criteria has been met, a player wins by declaring they win the game as their first action of their two on their turn.  This is both unique but also can cause games to drag on forever.  Especially with the max player count of 4, if people notice someone can declare a win on their next turn the other 3 players can each try to disrupt that before it gets back to them.

This is what ultimately would keep me away from this game, there is a house rule to make the game end automatically as well as the standard "declare victory" win condition but it has its own problems as well.  There is also a small chance of getting screwed over with the initial random setup.  Since each location has different symbols you can get a lot of a less useful symbol or a bad spread compared to your opponents to begin the game with a disadvantage.  The same can be said about the actual locations on the board.  For example, controlling an island of 3 locations can mean a huge point swing so being the only one to start on that island in the beginning is another random advantage.  Not to mention starting turn order with no balancing mechanism for later acting players adds to the lack of balancing in this game.

Finally a less important but still meaningful criticism is the game looks bland and boring.  For a game with magic portals and dragons in it the cards are all done in dull, dirty, muted colors and the artwork is black line art on a colored background with some text.  The game certainly doesn't look exciting, especially considering the theme.

It does away with the static and uneven war game elements I found in A Few Acres of Snow (I'm also not a wargamer) and I like a lot of the mechanics of area-control, deck-building, and multi-use cards so it is an interesting game but the poor end-game condition and possibility for starting imbalance and muddy looks of the game will keep me away.

You can tell this is a well-designed game with superb balance that speaks well of its play-testing. Deck-building is unique and more limited. The game forces you to spread your resources in a give-and-take strategic match of wits. Plenty of great variety and lots of choices to make. Has a slow build up, the theme is "meh," and other than that it just kind of falls a little flat and isn't overly exciting. But good cerebral challenge and will prove popular with thinky gamers, chess-type players, and Wallace fans.

A fun and fairly straightforward DoaM which I'll happily play, but it didn't blow me away.

The two main complaints about this game are: (1) that the end game can drag (as the leader goes back and forth each turn for potentially a long time, preventing someone from being ahead on his turn and declaring the End Game action), and (2) the imbalance of a few cards -- Diplomat and Reserve Army come to mind.

These two problems are very easily correctable with simple house rules -- such as by ending the game immediately when the fourth victory point card is emptied, and by either removing the Diplomat and Reserve Army from the game or changing their powers so that they aren't so unbalancing.  Solved.

What you have left after these simple tweaks is an easy to learn, rich, fun, moderately complex area control game with a variety of ways of getting points along with good player interaction.  One of my favorites.  Works great as a two player game.

Looking forward to digging deeper into the strategy behind this excellent hand management game. Not sure about 3-4p but this plays well at 2p, though a bit long. Tons of replay value. Recommended variant: card drafting of provinces at the beginning of game.

A shame about the uninspiring box cover and the somewhat misleading title. There is no Greek or Roman mythology, but rather a world left open to your imagination. Everything inside the box, however, looks great and plays fluid.

RATING: 7.3
I've only played [thing=79828][/thing] once. I haven't played it again mainly because we hardly ever play with only 2. But I did enjoy it a lot. I know there is a broken strategy but since I'm not a history guy, I don't know what it is, so it's not a problem for us (yet). This game is using the same base mechanism of deck building and gaining territories, but other than that this is a very different game. And since there are no historical, faction specific cards, that broken strategy doesn't exist here.
This is a medium weight game of conquering land and managing your deck. Like in most of Martin's deck building games, that mechanism is just one of many and it doesn't work in the Dominion way, it works quite differently: draw up to your hand size (usually 5) and perform 2 actions some of which will require cards, some of which wont. Refill your hand to your hand size. You get points for having control of a province but also for performing actions tied to the bonus scoring card of which there are 7. There is quite some direct player interaction and taking areas from other players going on. But in this game it doesn't bother me too much. I guess most of that is down to the non destructive nature of it. Losing a province card - while not pleasant - will not ruing any strategies. It's not really a big deal and you can usually recover. Since provinces don't have any defense from themselves, taking them from another player is quite easy. I like the combination of elements and it all works together quite well with a playing time of around 90 minutes which is perfect for this game. It isn't anything new or spectacular, but it is certainly very, very solid.

A game in search of an ending. And oh, does this game need one. 60 minutes of building, expanding and honing your deck, followed by 60 minutes of bash the leader and stop someone (anyone!) from winning. Jesus, what a tedious fucking end to a game.

What's to like? The deck building is mildly interesting, keeping enough resources back to do what you want and the regions to do it from.

What's not to like? The leader bashing, being unable to end the game if no-one else wants to, the leader bashing, the long drawn out finish, the leader bashing, the stupid names of the regions, the brown art, another unpolished, unfinished Wallace product thrown out the door.

The score track is stupid, graphix a bit bland, province names laughable, game length much longer than stated, start and end game that could use a house rule, but there is a VERY good solid game here, with VERY good mechanisms, plays very smooth.  

At the moment it can be purchased very cheap, well worth getting.  I have nothing really like it in my collection and it plays great with 2, 3 (haven't tried 4).  Box just right size!

Use following variants to make game brilliant!

*Draft cards at Beginning
*VP Chips secret, only province vp scored on track
*On clearing of 4th vp card, everyone has one more turn then game ends. 

First 3 player game 3.5 hours.

Flawed masterpiece (easily fixed)

Pimped mine with wooden bits!

Not a bad game (reminds me of Kemet, actually) but it's fairly lacking in some respects.  

The theme is generic conquest stuff that's not at all helped in its expression by the lazy/lousy setting and aesthetics.  The deck building part of the game feels kinda truncated and restrictive with rapidly diminishing pickings for card additions (some of which are just duplicates of cards you already have).  And I'm not sure if I like or dislike the potentially drawn out end-game of kingmaking.

I'd play it again but I'm not dying to... it's really quite unremarkable and I don't think it would have too much in terms of replayability.

It's not a bad game, I just really didn't care for it.  The random countries felt like Risk where you can get screwed right off the bat with having no money or military.  Same with being attacked in your only valuable country by several players at once.

The Good
Mythotopia requires players to balance resources and actions through hand management and the need to combo moves.  It has the feel of a medieval worker placement game, and though it has war, it takes considerable effort to destroy your neighbors.  

Scoring is done by combining conquest with building, with the later providing other advantages such as tougher provinces, free movement, or a larger reserve.

I am going to include the optional rule for choosing provinces as a part of the good, especially with four players, as it prevents everyone from getting too many food cards in their starting deck.

The Bad
The fluff.  Get rid of the dragons for something like hordes or Vikings* to mechanically do the same thing and then Mythotopia could easily be skinned as a medieval themed game.

The Ugly
Score tracker: it should have been designed to start at 1. The wooden Boats: I can hear someone saying, "I like the boats," but the problem is they look like they are missing their mast and incomplete.

First impression was disappointed.  Though a three player game turned into a 2 player game suddenly, so the balance was out of whack.  It still felt like a tedious back and forth without much interesting in the way of decisions.  Deck Builders bore me, but I love the mechanism when worked into a larger game.  Think this might be too much repetitive deck builder and not enough interesting stuff on the board.  A step up from Trains, but not enough.

Interesting deck building driven area control game. The deck building is quite limited though with just 4 starter cards plus a card for each province you control and a total of just 16 special ability cards available to buy between all players. Plenty of variation for replayability with 3 fixed and 4 random victory point conditions.

Strange blend of area control and deck building. I wanted to like it more then I actually did. I am a fan of Martin Wallace but this game missed the mark for me. It's his normally bland board and components. The rule book is brutal. The game seemed fiddly. I can see the game possibly going way to long. The positives are I've never really played anything like it and a very neat trigger to end game. Overall unimpressed.

An economist's take on empire-building and warfare... building roads and cities requires a Herculean effort of planning and card-management; warfare is a protracted affair that can linger for many turns.  Whilst this may not be the stuff to set a player's heart to pounding, Mythotopia is a very clever and enjoyable game.  I just wish it came with a double-sided map, and a less-generic theme.

it is sooo difficult to evaluate this title. After reading the rules this seemed one of the best games EVER, my cup of tea, an author that appreciate a lot and most of all a bunch of wonderful mechanics.

After playing for too long (more than 2 hours maybe) my sensations are mixed: expectations weren't fulfilled and the game dragged slowly to the end with a blatant kingmaking coup saluted by cheers of "at last it's finished!".

It seems the first turns are spent gaining special cards and then that kind of possible action disappears. The final turns are spent considering who could win the next turn (much à la "Cyclades").

I will play this again, i need to understand what went wrong.

Card drafting fantasy deck builder for area control of the game board provinces. Play sets of province cards to target an area, select the action, and pay the required food, stone or gold resources. Add upgrades to your deck, thin it, and pay costs to build and upgrade Catan-like settlements and road systems.

Might be good with certain players, but when played with players who play a good combo that allows for "keeping the other player down" actions, it definitely is not fun and makes the game longer than needed.  Some overly powerful improvement cards.  Huge swings for winning/losing provinces.  Really did not like both plays (4p and 2p).

One of the big draws of A Few Acres of Snow is its historic context and flavor, and that is completely absent here.  Mythotopia's generic medieval setting (high fantasy?  low reality?) does more harm than good, and the embarrassing province names REALLY don't help.  

My biggest criticism is that Mythotopia relies on a 'self-correction' philosophy, which is the assumption that randomly distributed resources and unbalanced improvements are OK (really?), since the players who don't benefit from these resources/improvements will "surely" gang up on those who do.  That falls under the category of bad design, I think.

I was so nonplussed after my first play that I'm now debating whether AFAoS is worse than I remember, or whether this close cousin just isn't a worthy successor.

After a couple of plays I sympathize with the comments about the end game dragging but also note that a lot of players DON'T have a problem with this. The jury is still out with me. I would like to try one or two of the suggested "fixes" in the forums for giving the game a definite length. Using a "Shuffle Track" sounds interesting as a "game clock" but then it's important to make the last round limited to neutral territory invasions to reduce last minute grab for defender winning tied battles.

I have a hard time picturing anyone playing this game in 60 minutes with the endgame rules as written. The endgame is a painful and drawn-out affair of bash-the-leader combined with a high potential for kingmaking. Just awful!

I'm a fan of the deckbuilder with a board concept, and would be willing to try some house rules for a smoother endgame, but the likelihood of experimenting with such when there are so many games that are great out of the box is likely to never happen.

It will take some convincing, and not other options, to get me to play this again.

This game intrigued me ever since it was just a playtest rumour I heard.
Now, after playing the beast, I can confirm that it's an amazing game. Truly a worthy son of [i]Dominion[/i].

The theme is applied thinly, the box art is pretty unevocative, the naming on the board is dogshit-funny, and the checklist of possible actions you can do on your turn looks undercooked, but don't let any of that fool you. [i]Mythotopia[/i] is a fantastically well-designed game.

Yes, sometimes people I introduce this game to hate its guts, and wish to punch its fat face - and sometimes the game itself "bursts a tire on the last lap", but I still love the damned thing.

Rating is as a two-player game. With 3 or 4, I'd give it a 6, or a 7 when using a house variant we came up with to obscure the VP tally a bit: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1519861/

A multiplayer card-driven game using mechanics similar to those introduced in A Few Acres of Snow. Another fantastic game by Martin Wallace. Only complaint is that the rulebook is poorly laid out and the first game takes a while as you sort through things to ensure you're doing things correctly or not cheating inadvertently. But once you get the hang of it, the game just flies. This will be hitting the table again shortly!

RATING: N/A
Good mechanics (similar to A Few Acres of Snow), but too much randomness in who attacks who when and there's not really anything you can do to prevent it. Additionally, the end game is so bad that it completely breaks the game and just becomes X vs. 1 until someone lucks into being able to declare the winning condition (which you have to do at the beginning of your turn).

Need to play again with an endgame variant to see how much it helps, but, until then, Rating = 3.

Excellent game but I highly recommend the mini pack with the missions as this makes the game faster, gives the players more incentive to eliminate each other and keeps everyone guessing!

Web of lies, it's no deck builder. Each player gets their own individual deck to which cards are added, but there is really not any building done to customize the deck. The line up of cards you can add is random...  so random that only three cards are available to acquire at a time, and one of those three is face down. So really only two cards with any information showing. Fear not, 90% of the cards seem to be direct conflict cards because there is only one way to win the game and that's to kill the most people. Yep, you are force into direct combat with other players. It's a take that game which pretends like it has other things going for it.

Now let's say that by chance one of the cards is something you are interested in, which is awesome... then you realize that in order to buy the card you need to get to the randomly selected spot(chucking dice) on the map where the weapon crate which corresponds to the card you want is located... and that you have to have enough cards left to burn to grab the crate... and that you have majority control of that location... and that all the stars are facing the east... and that the baby goat you sacrifice to the third son god was a worth sacrifice.

The game just appears to require an amazing amount of luck to win...  while trying to hide a "take that" game as a deck builder. I can honestly say I hate this game.

Very very fun. Loads of fun! Makes you feel like a certain globe-trotting British secret agent/spy that shall remain nameless ;) Very unpredictable and the interaction where you try to psych the other players to go after the other guy instead of you is half of the fun. Lots of replayability.

This has rapidly become our favorite go-to game.  It is light and quick enough to play in an evening after work, is a great opener as it is easy to explain to others, and is very atmospheric with great replayability due to all the cards.  We really love this one.  It's a 10/10!

[thing=166859][/thing] is a light [b]deck building[/b], spy thriller game with a map component that introduces some unique elements (compared to some other deck builders) to the game. 

Each player controls a spy agency, which is represented by the spies on the map and the cards (agency assets) in their hand. New cards (assets) are acquired by rendezvousing with the assets, which requires [b]point-to-point movement[/b] of your spies. 

Player elimination encourages, nay forces, a lot of [b]take that[/b] and aggressive action towards each other to ensure that you are not the lone spy watching from the sidelines as a victor is determined (but don't worry, the game ends shortly after this occurs). To eliminate the competition battles will occur where [b]hand management[/b], clever [b]deduction[/b], and a little bit of luck will see you emerge victorious.

Been a hit every time it reaches the table.  Both tense and playful at the same time.  

Secret Missions expansion is a little hit & miss, but adds variety.

Such a great game! I bring this one out a lot- with new players, family, and serious gamers and it always gets a great reaction from people. Everything from the artwork to the game length to the ease of teaching works great, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in it.

Played with the man himself who developed the game. Had a blast. It's a light hearted game based on assassinating your friends with Shotguns, Silenced Pistols, Bombs, and my personal favorite... the All-Mighty Cargo Plane. 

Supplies randomly drop across the world, and it's a race to grab them up to gain an edge on your rival agencies. Two of the supply drops are revealed to everybody, but one is re-stocked face down. Meaning, nobody will know if it's the most powerful card in the game, or just another speed boat. Discarding cards to move is done face down unless you are using a vehicle, meaning you can hide these cards until the end of the game as a trump card.

There's a surprising amount of depth hidden in this game, set-up is easy, and it's easy to learn how to play. I'm taking this with me to games nights everywhere.

It took awhile for our group to get to this game with the flood of great games last year, but this has become our new favorite opener game. It is quick enough to everyone engage. People have to put down their phones and pay attention to the game so they know who got what special item, who is becoming a threat, etc. You're never truly out of the game. I have gotten knocked down to 1 agent and then hung around for 30 minutes quietly picking people off.

The art work and board are wonderful.

Tons of replayability due to all the cards and secret mission deck. Also great for making house rules because the ending is so flexible.

My only con is that the cards are flimsy. They bend too easy and I've actually had to glue one back together after it started to separate.

I have the Print and Play right now and I love it. I am excited for the full version. It combines deck building with the back stabbing of risk, w/o the constant need to control territory. Check out the Kickstarter and get PNP!

Nice, lightweight tactical game that combines deck-building with... well, killing enemy spies.

Tried a five-player version of the PnP version, which isn't officially supported but still worked rather well besides running rather long. Easy-to-grasp, lots of fun little moments and some self-balancing gameplay that makes for a tense endgame.

Would need to play more to see if my group's general gripes have merit, but my feeling is that is more down to personal taste, and learning the game, or some simple tweak would fix it.

I took a chance on this Kickstarter game because we love deckbuilders and I liked the theme and art style.  The art style was completely changed during fulfillment, but I enjoy the new-and-improved art much better.  I'm happy to say that this one was a pleasant surprise.  My wife and I really like this game; it plays well with 2-players (especially with the expansion) and is just as good with 3 or 4.  It is a slightly different game with different player counts because so much of the map is crowded and assets are constantly revolving.  2-player is probably our favorite, but we'll play with any size group.

RATING: 6
It's a pretty good random "take that!", deck-building style game, though I feel it runs just a liiiiittle too long. 

I like the way it uses the engine-building mechanic of something like dominion, but instead of relying completely on luck to acquire the right cards to allow one to build the engine up (especially in the beginning), there is a sort of area control aspect to the game that allows players at least the ability to try to apply pressure on other players and influence the acquisition of cards beyond just drawing the right stuff you need. That said, the game is quite random even still, and some of the cards are just BRUTAL. This is not a game to be taken seriously. 

It's pretty good fun. I just wish there was a way to mitigate the amount of luck in having new assets (cards) dropping right down on player pieces already present on the space. I felt it was no coincidence that the final two players in the game were the two players to whom that happened the most frequently.

* Kickstarted! *

Be the last man standing as you use devices picked up around the world to kill your opponents' agents. The game intentionally forces the use of cards collected for your deck building and has a random factor that keeps the game from getting stale. It plays quick and keeps everyone entertained.

PLUS: variation, forced interaction
MINUS: takes a few rounds to really get exciting

This is a decent game with a cool spy theme. It does run a bit to long for what it is but we enjoyed it. However, we didn't seem to reach for it often enough to warrant keeping it with our limit shelf space, so we gave it away.

Nice simple game of elimination, with a bit of deck building, area control, hand management, and take that! Spies need to gain new weapons and defensive cards, attack and kill enemies while remaining outside of harm. It's quick and simple.

RATING: 10
Let us start simply: It is AWESOME!
Rather light but it can evoke suspense and thrill. Very clear rules and quite a big flavour and atmosphere if you are willing to emerge yourself.
The game is good when you play with 2 but it shines with 3 and 4.
At the end we found the tension rising and Fortune was changing her mind a lot.
It is the lightness of Web of Spies that makes the randomness undisturbing but it might happen that one player can perform spectacular combos when other can just watch, still you can just loose and start over.
We had a lot of fun playing it and just as a side effect we started to immitate shooting at each other with the pistols equipped with suppressors and escaping a helicopter in a yacht - great fun!!!
This is a little sparkle of genious and I wish all the best and a massive success to the author!
Enjoy working for the Agency ;)

I'd recommend the Secret Missions expansion right out of the box if you can get it. It's got great art and is pretty tight, though, so it's still a decent game without the extra content. A surprise hit with our group who likes a little take that and a little strategy to their games.

Print and Play version.  Provides a fun deckbuilding framework -- especially around the combats.  I find it quite easy to tell the story of a combat:  "My spy approaches yours and pulls out his silenced pistol.  Your spy ducks and covers, only to jump in a black getaway car at the last moment.  The trick is on you though, because the getaway car is rigged with C4 and explodes, killing your agent and allowing me to laugh maniacally."  These stories are not heavy; they are just the right size for the theme, which is a quick progressing spy movie.  If you like telling spy stories and playing a quick game, this one's for you.

Played with "Mike" at Kublacon the morning of Sunday, May 29th. Was ahead, but that drew the enmity of the other three players, so quite suddenly I was behind. I tried a desperate gambit and lost...  After only one game (and while sleep-deprived) I can't guarantee it is as good as my first impression, but I'd want to play it again to check.

RATING: 8
Fun game!  It's a light, pretty fast deck-builder where acquiring cards requires moving around the board, and you don't know what all of your opponent's cards are.  Keeps the tension up, and choosing what to try to acquire when/when to try to attack another player's agents is enjoyable.  The game also looks great - lovely and evocative art, very clean and effective graphic design.

RATING: 7
Score is based off playing with the secret mission cards but with a slight variant (which is informally mentioned in the rules but not much detail is given): We remove 13 of the mission cards (6x Establish A Headquarters, 2x Create A Distraction, 2x Sacrifice An Agent, 1x Delay the Mission, 1x Interrogate An Enemy, and 1x Rendezvous With Friendly Agents), shuffle the mission cards, and then draw 3 face-up to the side of the board. Any player can then fulfill and claim them or any player can go to the cancellation space to discard one of choice, draw 2, and pick one to replace it with. The rest is pretty much the same, playing to 10 points (or higher for a longer game).
The base rules were a little too vanilla and the secret mission cards added too much chance; this solution seemed to keep things interesting and still strategic.
We worked this variant out based on one line in the rule book suggesting you could play with the missions public (the intent though was probably for each player to still have their own cards).
I will write up this variant and post it to BGG if anyone is interested. This variant added much more replayability to the game IMO.

RATING: 3
rating based on the PNP during the KS campaign.  As printed, the game is extremely random, had runaway leader and lockout issues, and had an anti-climactic end game.  With a small number of changes, I think the game could easily become a 6/10.

Minimum changes:
(a) As soon as you place a new card-buying-location, roll the continent location for its NEXT placement, so you know roughly where it will be going next.
(b) When you lose an agent, also trash any one card from your deck/discard/hand.
(c) Winner is the player with the most kills (not most survivors) with tied being broken by most survivors.
(d) Add some (difficult) mission cards in the deck itself that will be worth points, to allow for scores to be not fully known (thus creating a more tense end game).
(e) rebalance a bunch of individual cards; they're ok overall, but a few stand out as being imbalanced.

Barely a deckbuilder, but if it is I would rather play any other — even Legendary. Barely an area-control, but if it is I would rather play any other — even Risk. I haven't yet played any other deckbuilder/area-control hybrids, but I doubt any of them could be as rubbish as this.

Played it last night for the first time and had a blast!! I'm looking forward to much more playtime to get all the card synergies figured out. I was behind for most of the game but ended up doing a quick assassination and won the game. A lot of twist and turns possible with this game. I am looking forward to this game getting published. 

We are playing the PnP version. Only suggestion is to get card sleeves if you're playing the PnP on regular printer paper or print the cards on card stock. We could see through the back of the cards.

Great fun, the kids play often. It runs a little long and some cards are a little strong. But, the finish is always exciting. There is a significant amount of strategy, but luck plays a big role. You can overcome dreadful odds however. My youngest son won a game that we were sure he would lose because his brother had 3 of the 4 most powerful cards. I like this game and will continue to play.

AMAZING GAME!  The designer did so much with this game and its card deck.  The cards run movement, attacking and defending, special game effect, and purchasing.  Thus eliminating a bank (paper money), record keeping of movement, turn steps/actions you find in similar games. Any rule questions on what to do is located on the board and in the text of the card.  EASY TO LEARN, FUN TO PLAY, and it even has some depth and strategy for such a light and Streamlined game.

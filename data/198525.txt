I am so pleased with this beautiful card game. It is elegant both in its presentation and gameplay mechanics. Buy it. You will not be disappointed. I like to play this one any time I've had a stressful day and I just need to grow some flowers in my tabletop garden.  Also, every time I bring this to a game night, people are enchanted by the artwork and theme.

Lotus is a beautiful game that grows into a unique work of art every time you play.

Clear your head and take in the quiet strength of the lotus garden. It takes skillful care and nurturing to grow these flowers to their full potential, but, once picked, they provide their owner with wisdom. Beware, for there are others who will do anything they can to get their hands on these mystical flowers. You'll need to enlist the help of creatures native to this land to take control of the lotus garden and achieve true enlightenment.

RATING: 5
Very pretty, but also pretty inconsequential (see what I did there?). Sort of reminds me of dots and boxes - you never want to set someone else up to finish the flower, so it just sort of sits there just short of being able to complete in one round.

Beautiful game with wonderful artwork.  Best as a 2P game since it is an abstract game. Good for a filler, but I think there are many other games (Battleline, Tash Kalar, Fealty, Flash DUel) that I'd rather play.

RATING: 6
This really had a Lanterns feel to it where it's almost like your decisions are made up for you when it gets to your turn.  There are other options you could take, but really only one "ideal" move.  The art is really pretty.  However, you have to embrace the "I'm building a flower" concept to make it work.  After a while, my group just started dropping cards in a stacked pile splayed with the number of cards visible rather than the full flower.  And I was surprised by this, but there were a few snickers by other players about needed to bring their child daughter over to play because it looked rather "childish".  Not my take on it, but it was noted.

Lotus isn't a good 2 player game but it's worse with 4.  There's always one player who never has a shot to complete any flowers and another who completes one or two every turn.  Much more luck than strategy. Pretty flowers are just the proverbial lipstick on a pig with this one.

Other than the unique and pretty aspect of the way the cards lay out to form flowers, I thought this was a fairly boring area majority game. There was at least some interest in trying to win the area majorities, which not setting up another player to finish a flower (a player who finishes a flower scores points along with the player who "controls" that flower with their insects), but it wasn't all that engaging.

Overall, a good game to play as light fare with family, but nothing I would really choose to play outside of that.

An area control card game where you are building flowers to score the most points. When a flower is completed you get all the cards (1 point each) and whoever has the most control (played the most cards) gets either 5 points or a special power. It's very simple and plays quickly, but didn't really stand out to me. I guess I'm not a flower person as it was easy for me to just line up the cards to count the control as opposed to in a circle. I'll play if someone suggests but not one I need to own.

This game is a simple, yet engaging area control card game. The art is beautiful and functional and feels like every aspect was considered during production. I think it's a great game for gamers and non-gamers alike to play for a short period without a heavy time commitment. It's best if you play on a clean, round surface so you can fit all the cards and flowers as you lay them.

Had more than a bit in common with Lanterns, another Renegade game: beautiful art, lots to mull over, and endgame scores that are often very close together!

RATING: 5
Initial impressions:

Sort of an area control game with the ability to gain powers and/more points for having majorities on flowers (whoever plays the last card gets points as well).

There's some interesting things going on in terms of area control, timing the scoring of flowers and perhaps even a little deck manipulation (very slight).

However for me, this game feels too similar to lanterns and I prefer that game to this. The area control aspect of the game didn't feel as prolonged as I hoped it would have (flowers were opening and closing within a round, most likely a groupthink problem), and on my turn s I didn't want to play cards...But not in a good way like in Arboretum, just in a in screwed way most of the game.

I won a very tightly contested game, but as I said, I just prefer Lanterns, Aroretum, or Pi Mal Pflaumen over this one in the light filler category

Another game driven by gimmick over substance. Remove the pretty flower making artwork and you are left with something dull and random. It is hard to set up points when you have little control in what you draw.

As a side note, I'm likely in the minority here, but I'm getting bored of games with custom cut meeples. So far, they always seem to end up in kickstarter games that rely on them as a selling point.

I really liked this for the first two games, but it is solvable. Once you figure out the only upgrade worth going for, you'll win more often than not against people who haven't figured it out. It boils down to luck beyond that. It looks gorgeous and has great table presence though.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I am not really convinced this works very well as a 3 player game, there seems to be a distinct 1st player disadvantage.
It also feels very like once you have all three of the special abilities in play them you are quite overpowered and a bit unstoppable, actually considering some house rules for this one.
I expect this will feel like a very different game in both 2 player and 4 player and so i hope you get at least one game in at both these player counts before writing this one off.

Sold in a board game bundle in 2017.

I really love this game and it has a special place in my heart as it's one that really started up board gaming in my family, with my little daughter especially (along with Sushi Go and Sleeping Queens). I'm surprised this one doesn't receive more hype too, because since then I tried to find other Simple area control type games like this and really the only other one I found so far is another Renegade game, Bullfrogs (which I can't wait to play with my daughter and son). Lotus is very basic area control, with beautiful art on cards, simple card drafting, with a number of simple but varied decisions to make through the game. Easy enough for my 6 yr old daughter to grasp, with the allure of gorgeous flowers to pull her in. My wife likes it too and won her very first game of it (easy to grasp, again, and winnable by someone who is good at cards).

This is an elegant game with easy mechanics, gorgeous art, and thoughtful strategic elements.     

The use of flowers to make the different suits and sized sets is brilliant, and, and the design of the cards work with that theme with thoughtful elegance.

On top of theme and looks, it has a great game play making for a relaxing but engaging game with your friends, plays quickly allowing for wide variety of table-times or playing several times in a row.

It is no surprise that the folks that made Lanterns bring this game, because its in the same class and I cannot recommend this game enough for folks looking for a quick playing game with a touch of class, unique theme, gorgeous components, and real game-play.

Feh...this one is tolerable, which is more than what I can say for most Asian-inspired games I have played. Three players for filler is probably the sweet spot.

As one of my best friends put it, "it's pretty, but casual af."

RATING: 8
A very under rated card game.  Lotus has tremendous depth to complexity ratio.  Each turn you can select two of three actions. There is a reward for completing a flower and rewards for controlling a completed flower.  If you are not careful, you could set up your opponent to complete a flower, while stealing control from you.  Three potential upgrades are available that help your ability to control and complete flowers.  Getting those abilities early is important, so you must be alert that you actions do not assist your opponent in getting his upgrades before you do.

So simple, but because of the tension in each game, I cannot see myself getting tired of this game.

The game seems simple and somewhat luck driven at first but there are a lot of little tactical nuances that start to show themselves after a couple of plays. Some upgrades feel weaker but they are quite well balanced if you get them under the right consequences and they fit your strategy. My only complaint is at a 3-4 player game a new player can really mess things up and unbalance the game but that is a minor complaint. Overall, I like it and I didn't even mention gorgeous artwork present here. Recommend it as a tactical and gorgeous filler card game.

The art in this game is lovely, the mechanics are simple, but really should be 2-3 players. Playing with 4 doesn't work, there's zero chance a flower ever gets back to you if you ever contribute a card to it. Makes the game stall or hands points to other players.

Yippee  !   At last an area control game that works very well with 2 players. I normally would not get a flower themed game but it kinda works for what is a fun filler. Glad I ROSE to challenge and got this game. A great game to play with your BUDdies.

Category: Light Strategy - beautiful looking game, rules are super simple and plays very quickly, its a great gateway game.  However, after repeated plays, game is more driven by luck and it appears the special powers are a must, the first to acquire it can dominate the game, creating a snowball effect, leaving the other opponent little chance to score and catch up.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]An excellent, light, area control card game. Definitely not a combination of theme and mechanics that I'd ever expect, but it works quite well. Renegade games continues to carve out a niche of creating great gateway games that are a bit different than a lot of other "gateway" games. This is due in large part to their choice of theme and/or innovating on a mechanism already found in a lot of other games and managing to make sub 45 minute games that are rules light and easy to teach to anyone. Lanterns and Clank are other hits in my house from Renegade, I like 1893: World's Fair but not nearly as much as these others [i](I think it had the least intuitive rule set of the bunch)[/i].

I love area control games, but they tend to usually shine with 3+ if not 4+ players. Up until this point Royals has been the notable exception, for me, that works extremely well with two players. Now I'd add Lotus to that list and similar to Royals is an excellent gateway game. Compared to Royals, Lotus is much easier to travel with since it is only a card game and could easily be played at a cafe or pub. Lotus also has a great theme, building flowers, and beautiful artwork and little wooden bugs. The theme, compactness and simplicity of the rules will make this a hit with my wife. For such a light rule set there are plenty of decisions to be made, Lotus is not a light game that plays itself.[/i]

I just cannot see playing this game more than maybe twice.  Though the cards are pretty, they are so simple and singular that they eventually become dull.  Also, once someone gets the ability for a larger hand size and the ability to play many cards to one flower, they can start and finish a flower in a single turn and the game loses any semblance of tension or fun.

Lotus is a simple card-based area-majority game. Players have a hand of petal cards and each turn they can add those petals to one or more corresponding flowers. Petal cards have 0, 1, or 2 control markers, and each flower has a certain number of petals needed before it is complete. When a flower is completed, the completing players gets a 5-point bonus, and the player with the most control tokens gets the cards in the flower (each of which is worth a point). The real gimmick of the game, though, is that the petal cards are designed to be arranged to form pictures of actual flowers, which is quite striking visually. However, the gameplay itself is very straightforward and I found it to be pretty bland.

I received this game as a birthday gift from my gamer man because he knows how much I love flowers. 

It's easy to teach and a great game to play with "non-gamers" because it isn't intimidating, and its pretty :) This game also has enough strategy for the super gamers among us because you can really hose other people if you play your cards right.

Hope you enjoy the game as much as I do!

Beautiful! Nearly had me buying it for its beauty alone. It had sold out at GenCon before I could try, however. Glad I played it. Glorified set collection (making pretty flowers). Rules were very unclear when I played, and it isn't even that complicated. The first game did sour my opinion a little bit. I definitely want to play it again for a legit game. While nothing like it, Lotus reminds me of Coloretto. Same easy play with a few more options. It is like opposite Coloretto, maybe. definitely same Genre. I do recommend this game for new players and casual players.

RATING: 1
This is a terrible card game, with beautiful art. The general idea is that you start building flowers with cards, and then other players complete them, getting a bonus, and win a majority scoring on them, getting another bonus. Then you either hope that happens for you eventually, or just set someone up for another score. Abysmal waste of time and waste of beautiful artwork.

Flower deities tending to the growth of flowers, sending their guardians to do their bidding. Gazing at the beautiful flowers opens the path to enlightenment.

Has a simplicity to it that is really enjoyable. This game is actually really cut throat. So you may think because it is flowers that there is nothing mean about it, but you are stealing and robbing flowers. The game is incredibly simple and yet the petal placement is the core of the game. Sure the gathering of points and petal cards are the way you score, but it is a strategy of forcing your opponent to play first. Great game and has some strategy regardless of it's simplicity.

Simple enough, but with enough going on to keep things interesting, tactical, and, especially in the two-player game, strategic. Refreshing after many games that pound in far too many special abilities. 
Lovely flower art and cute little insect "guardians" add to the appeal for many. 
Mechanism with the neutral deck adds a TTR/China/Lost Cities element in that players can enjoy selection from a common pool and also hasten or delay the end of the game.

A card based area control game in which players need to construct and control as many flowers as possible for victory points. The production value for the price point ($18 Amazon) is top notch and a great value. Able to infuse some strategy and mitigate luck of the draw with bonus tokens and guardians. Easy to teach, plays quickly with little downtime between turns. Highly recommended filler with high production value.

Fine little game - suitable for rather new gamers and kids, but also as a light / fillerlike game for gamers. The theme suit the game well, but you certainly doesn't have to be a flower enthusiast :-)

I don't like too much luck in games - this games takes it to the edge, but it still has enough strategic and interesting choices.

It even has quite nice development (build-up/early, mid/late-game and last round can lead to somewhat different choices) through the very short playtime.

I did fear it would have too little strategy and too much randomness, but I feel it really has a nice mix, and I still enjoy it after 10+ plays.

4 player games get a bit too random for me though - I prefer 3 player games.

It can be surprisingly cutthroat for a game about growing flowers!

Beautiful filler, but gameplay is nothing special.  Creating the flowers is very aesthetically pleasing, as are the wooden insect meeples that represent players.  A lot of care went into the production of this game, and it shows.  Gameplay isn't quite as engaging, with simple area majority and draw mechanics built around the graphic design framework.  But if you want a visually stunning filler, this is an adequate choice.

Bad luck can leave you losing heavily early on with no chance of pulling it back. Not my cup of tea most days.

Filler area control card game to complete and control central flower blossoms from identical player decks and neutral flower petal cards.  Each blossom type require different number of cards to complete the pattern. The signature of the game is the beautiful petal cards and the strategy and timing of when to add to or start new blossom patterns while keeping control and hopefully setting up scoring opportunities.  A bluffing poker element arises from what cards the players draw or are holding in their hand.

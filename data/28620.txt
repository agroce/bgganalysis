Sceptre of Zavandor re-themed and cut down to its core mechanisms. And it works very well. All the fiddliness has been taken out but still involves the same sort of decisions as the other game. However, it doesn't have the  equivalent of the Books of Knowledge which I miss because these provide an additional level of strategy which has to be considered. However, the play time is roughly halved so I suspect it will see a lot more play than Sceptres. Only initial concern is that the Dye / Dye Maker feels a little too powerful but this may go with more understanding

At heart, an auction game with a pseudo-tech tree.

A good, solid game.  A bit confusing at first as there are a lot of options and gameplay isn't always intuitive, but once you get past that it's a fun game.  I think there's more strategy there than at first glance.  Rating may improve with additional plays.  I'd like to play this one a few more times - I doubt I've entirely grasped all the mechanics and choices.

8/24/08 - Rating upgraded from 7 to 8.  I better appreciate the gameplay and options, not to mention I enjoy playing it.  I think I'll need to pick up a copy at some point.

4/01/09 - Snagged a copy from a friend.  Loving it even more.  Tempted to upgrade from 8 to 9.

4/09/09 - Played it even more.  Really loving how the auctions and valuation work.  Better appreciating different strategies and directions.  I particularly like how the game scales from 3-5 players.  3-player games can take < 30 min. and still provide an excellent game.  Rating bumped from 8 to 9.  I will play this one almost any time.  Very glad I own it now.

Runaway leader problems aside I have not had any negative comments about this game. There is room here to practice different strategies, ie; concentrating on mining. Auction games I have are part of a bigger picture, ie; building a civilisation from scratch and have fit in well as a main part of the game.

Yet another Euro-efficiency game, Phoenicia brings nothing new to the genre.  I believe the game has a real problem with its central mechanic, the auctions.  After the first turn or two they work progressively less well as disparities in income and specialisation in collecting one type of building or another develop.  The auctions need to operate as a balancing mechanism in order to prevent a run away leader.  The leader must be prevented from winning bids or at least forced to pay too much.  The problem is that this carries the risk that a player forcing up the bidding will find themself with an expensive building that doesn't improve their position, and with their plans for the turn in tatters.  The strong grow stronger and there really is no recovery possible from a sub-optimal start against competent opponents.  

Tiny text and icons on the cards are a pain and the board design is poor.

Wish I had commented on this one while the game was fresh in my memory.  Now, my memories: pretty lame-o production, rules were way better than I expected from reading BGG comments, seems prone to runaway leadership among novice players.  Can't speak for advanced ones, but I think the novice experience matters.  I've been strangely interested in revisiting it, even though we played it 2x to a ho-hum response the only time I tried.

There are interesting things about this game.  I enjoyed the first play, but didn't race to pick it up until I could get it dirt cheap.  Why?  Production quality is odd.  It is well made, but has design layout choices that are odd.  Important icons are left small while wide swaths of card space is filled with meaningless images.  Now that I have a copy, I should give it a few more tries.

6/4/2009: I've played 3 games of this so far, and in every game it seems that the winner was determined in the first 3rd of the game.  I don't know if that will change with more experience, as we learn to bid beter.  Getting enough storehouses so that you are not limited on cards is critical.

I didn't think that the component production values were all that bad other than the rules being unclear.  I would have liked a little more developement in the development tree for my taste.  Rulebook was very unclear, it took 3 playings before we had the rules down correctly.  There were some aspects of the Caravan card that were not mentioned in the rules, and we didn't figure out the 4 coins - card exchange right away.

When I first played this one, I thought: "Yet another auction game? These are getting kinda boring already!". And in fact, even after some more plays, the game felt exactly as a stripped-down auction game.

It wasn't until the 3rd or 4th play that I actually began to understand how the discount tree and the worker assignment really clicked on the rest of the game. I started seeing how buying a card wasn't always the best option... it was sometimes best to just hold on and try to get your economy going with the workers you got.

Finally, after a couple more plays, I saw how the final element in the mix worked wonders: the storehouses doesn't seem that important at first, but understanding how they work is very important to your performance in the game.

All in all, it's basically an economic engine (a.k.a. "snowball") game. The auction mechanic is not the basic engine behind the game, even if it's present in 90% of the game. When at first I though rating this one with a lowly 5, now I've seen it's much more interesting than I thought, it gets a solid 7. It's not likely to change much in the future, though, as I've already played 10+ times... more than enough to get a very clear idea of whether I love it or not.

This game sounds like a good thing. I like economic engine games. And I like auction games. This should be a shoe in. But there is too much flipping of tiles around, and moving markers to indicate stuff. The main board really has no purpose. Too much confusion for what is really happening. Plus, bonus runaway leader!

RATING: 9
A streamlined version of Outpost (or Scepter von Zavandor) that trims several fiddly details. In particular, there's only a single currency deck, and the cards do not vary much. That one change probably cuts the game time by a third.

Wonderful, civilisation lite ( very lite ) themed build engine game. Esentially Zepter von Zavander stripped down to basics it plays quicker, losing a little depth as expected. You auction cards that give victory points/people/production, one card usually betters another card as game progresses. Swifter play equalises the loss of depth from ZvZ.

I bought the game because I am becoming a Tom Lehmann fanboy (after Race for the Galaxy and Pandemic: On the Brink), even after reading that the production quality is questionable, and the rulebook sucks. Well, the components are indeed quite horrible (why plastics instead of wood?), and the graphics not much better. As for the rulebook, if I didn't read Neuland's one, this would be the worse I ever held in my hands...
Nevertheless, the game is quite interesting and unique ad far as my collection is concerned (I never played its ancestors "Outpost" or "The Scepter of Zavandor").
I can see the runaway leader problem many here on BGG complain about, but the game plays in a short time span, so perhaps this won't hurt too much...
We'll see after some more plays.

a fun game broken by the absurd snowball that can easily happen. very small differences in the begining like getting a '4' card when others get '6' can very quickly be magnified into unstoppable snowball. perhaps this is fun when it doesn't happen, but I am not willing to risk sitting for an hour waiting for the obvious end. perhaps this game needs a vote every round by the players if they see any sense in playing on...

After working through the very difficult rules, it isn't a bad game at all. Even after the start of the game, it's hard to find the right strategy. Only after a few turns it become clear how to play and win the game. There's a big chance that it is too late by then. The game is suited for experienced gamers who play it for at least the second time.

First Play: The card acquisition system with cards offering discounts on future cards and other game benifits is very similar to the mechanic in Civilization. First impressions are that a strong financial base is needed before concentrating on points. It's probable that there are a number of strategies, concentrate on workers, wide worker base, workers focused on one card, or a specific line of cards, but until you have played once you don't really know what cards are coming up next. Not sure about the randomness of the money cards (4,5,or 6) as although the spread is a maximum of 2 it is possibly 50% of the total. This seemed a random weakness in an otherwise very balanced game.

This game is a tough call.  The rules are pretty bad.  Whenever you MUST read all Examples or you miss rules, that's a bad sign.  The game is fairly good, although it might be too stripped down.  I rarely felt like I had much choice in my play.  On the upside it only takes about an hour to play. (06-10-2010)

UPDATE:  Got this back out, remembering I wanted to give it a second chance.  The rules were a better read the second time through.  It's a good game, and I like the weight.  I think we're going to try again with a 2-player variant to get more cards out.  Looks like a keeper though.  Raised rating from a 7. (10-13-2014)

Excellent auction game.

Re: it being a faster, tighter version of Scepter of Zavandor, based on my plays, it seems just different -- macro decisions seem to matter a little less than in Scepter, but micro decisions seem to matter a bit more.  Overpaying by 1 in an auction rarely matters in Scepter but overpaying by 1 in Phoenicia can easily lose you the game.

The quicker play time is this game's biggest feature, I think.

Edit: Played a bit more and solidified my feelings on this -- I very slightly prefer Scepter as a game but because of the play time will probably end up playing this more often (and I don't feel too bad about that).

Have played two two-player games, and we didn't get all of the rules right in any of the sessions. Still, we enjoyed it. The rules are not just poor, they lack all the oinformation needed to play the game, and this is a first for me. Now that I have been able to check online FAqs etc., I understand how the game works and am rewally looking forward to playing it more. Those who called it "Through the Ages light" were right.

Edit: No, we never got the the point where we were certain we had all the rules tight, and I quickly sold the game. Not a good game.

A classic euro. Very little theme, lots of paths to victory and an auction at its heart. Unusual though in that there is an escalating system of increased funds, costs and VPs as the game continues. You don't want to be left behind as people rise up the score track in this one. I enjoyed it a lot.

If I had to relate Phoenicia to other games I would describe it as a cross between the author's own Pizarro and Puerto Rico.  Like the former it's at its core an auction game, except it doesn't have the good sense to stay stripped down like Pizarro.  Instead you spend a lot of extraneous time doing inconsequential things with your workers and fidgeting with the arcane money system.  I say inconsequential because each player could cover up their worker area and the game would play out with little difference and if that is the case why not just eradicate that portion of the game?  Of course, then you would just have a very bare bones auction game.

Also like Pizarro, the game never really progresses.  Consider if Puerto Rico ended about 3 rounds earlier than it usually does.  A player might feel cheated after all that hard work to build up infrastructure and the game doesn't let them use it.  That would be Phoenicia, except that all the auction cards and worker placements give either points  or income so you don't even have the interplay of powers seen in Puerto Rico.  Instead you get a bare bones economic game where you start off slow, accelerate rapidly and then  boom the game is over and you have nothing to show for it except your marker is further than your opponents'.  Admittedly, if the game didn't end quickly at that point you would have a massive run-away leader problem, worse than the one already present.

I guess I just expect more from a game obviously themed around advancing your civilization.  The genius of Settlers of Catan and Puerto Rico were that they each captured in a concise package different parts of the extremely addicting genre of Civilization; the former the exploration and the latter the technological and economic part.  Maybe if the cards in Phoenicia had more lasting benefits strategies could develop, opponents might look at your play area and what you bought earlier would actually matter beyond a small discount on something else that gives you points and income.  Lehmann obviously possesses designer chops, I just don't think the ideas here really work and so I perceive an auction game with a worker and income system intended to pad the game out rather than an integrated whole.

Significantly shorter than Outpost and Das Scepter... but at a price.  I think this game suffers since it has almost no pre-requisites for building things.  Also, obtaining and training workers seems prohibitively expensive... while income producing cards w/o worker requirements (e.g. Caravans) are fairly common.  The theme of this game works much better for me than Scepter's fantasy/magic/gems theme.  **UPDATE 12/07 - I need to try a game vs. experienced players to see if the runaway problem goes away.  I need to remember that employing clothmakers has the same result as buying ships (for similar cost).

Lets develop our city!

Nice game that could be a little better with a little more early game balance.  

The specific issues lie with the number of developements available to bid on in relation to the number of people playing the game. This imbalance is especially noted when 4 or more than 4 players are playing.  I beleive the game should have differing sets up then on these developments which earn victory points.

The components are nice the games is nice.

Es un juego de desarrollo basado en subastas, que utiliza la mecánica de colocación de trabajadores. Cada jugador representa a una ciudad en la que debe decantarse por ir desarrollando tecnologías (unas relacionadas con otras) para aumentar la producción y los puntos de victoria. Las tecnologías vienen representadas por cartas. En cada turno salen a subasta tantas cartas como jugadores. Algunas representan tecnologías, otras proporcionan descuentos para tecnologías más avanzadas. Otras premiten obtener trabajadores, etc, etc.
Los trabajadores, antes de ser empleados en una actividad, deben ser entrenados (coste) y además, debe comprarse herramienta para ese trabajador. La compra de herramientas se realiza posteriormente a la gestión de trabajadores, por lo que siempre hay que ir "preparando" el terreno antes de decicar a un trabajador.
Hay dos tracks de puntos. Uno relativo al dinero disponible (producción) y otro de puntos de victoria. No se puede ahorrar mucho. Hay un límite al número de cartas en la mano.
Es un juego de desarrollar bastante sencillito y resultón. Imagino que una segunda partida cambia la primera impresión. Se le critica de ser un poco "soso" o árido. Apenas hay interacción entre jugadores (salvo por el tema de subastas). A su favor, los caminos hacia la victoria son múltiples y variados. No le diría que no a una partida.

Very neat resource management game. Has some parallells with Scepter from Zavandor.
Plays a lot quicker than SfZ.
Has a very strange written rule book, that leaves out several important issues.

Given that I love RftG, I had high expectations for Phoenicia. Unfortunately, I found the game simply boring - auctions lack tension, the tech tree feels very simplistic, there is no point in having cards with different values, game components feel cheap, and the list goes on and on.

Great game, but limited replayability.  They need to learn from games like Agricola / St Petes, and release the game with a TON of variation.  it would then easily be a 9 or 10.  So sad to see a game come so close but then fail in the amount of content.  Jan 2008: rating lowered from 8 to 6 as I'm really tiring of it.  It needs a lot more variation.

RATING: 4
Auction-driven building game, much longer than I would like, and at its relatively short playing time, that's saying something. You really need to know what all the cards do and how they interact before playing, sort of like many card-driven consims, but here the theme is not nearly as engaging. With a name like Phoenicia, I want to circumnavigate Africa and the British Isles and bring exotic animals back to the Mediterranean. Anyway, I'm not quite ready to give it a 3, but I don't see myself ever playing this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like it.  It's quite a while since I played Outpost so detailed comparisons are difficult but I certainly prefer Phoenicia's playing time and it still manages to pack quite a bit into a fairly short time.  There's a real advantage to knowing the strengths of the cards and the sequence they appear in and it would be better if the chart on the game board helped more to overcome that - as it is it's of limited use.  There are some good player aids here (where else) which do the job though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think the complaints about the rules for this game are grossly overblown.
---
UPDATE: I've kicked the rating up to an 8 again, not least because it's almost at 10 plays. But the big thing for me I think was figuring out that the sweet spot seems to be at 3 or 4 players, and not 5, which seems a bit random (and a touch long) for my tastes. My fears about the Clothmaker seem to have been ill-founded; the Clothmaker is a good card, but the workers are expensive and it's definitely not a ticket to victory. Two Shipbuilders definitely is, though.
---
UPDATE: I continue to enjoy this game, but I think it has one critical point of instability: if one player is allowed to acquire two Shipyards or two City Centers, it's all but game-over.  This usually happens because a relatively inexperienced player undervalues one of them and lets another player get a duplicate. A bit of the Puerto Rico factor at work - as anticipated, Phoenicia is punishing of player experience disparities. I like bidding games, so I like Phoenicia, even though I'm not terribly good at it. But I think it has just enough awkward competitive dynamics, where player positions can develop in such a way that two players are competing with each other and going to lose while a third skates, to keep it from being a great game.

I also suspect the Clothmaker might be a touch overpowered.

Anyway, I still like the game quite a bit. The gameplay is compelling and it's thematically strong. But it's not keeping my coming back quite as well as I had hoped.
---
I enjoyed this. Once again, we're on a quest to build a better Outpost (perhaps not the worthiest of design goals, but still). I think Tom has put enough in this one to make it work - there are enough resource dimensions, with population, technology, victory points, and production to make it interesting, the auctions work and add tension and some fun, and the game is short enough (90min or so) to not outlast its welcome, which it could very easily have done. There is perhaps a little more arbitrary randomness as a result of the card ordering then it might first appear, but it's not so bad, and again the game is reasonably short (Phoenicia reminds of Through the Ages in general feel of multi-dimensional resource management, but Phoenicia seems to have more flavor, more control, and more sensible length). The game is just not quite as heavy as you might think from first impressions, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Still, Phoenicia is what it is - an economy-building game - and that implies a few issues, like runaway leaders and fall-behind losers, but I think the linkage between production and victory points is just weak enough to be acceptable. It's still there, though, and therefore so is the potential for frustration. Like Outpost before it, too, it also rewards experience more than I would generally like, in that a player with a couple plays under his or her belt will have a big advantage over a new player. Obviously, this will always be the case to some degree, but if a game has a particularly steep skill-acquisition curve to the point that a player who is playing for the first time won't have much chance against a player who has played 5 times, that's going to be a problem for this sort of game.

But, on balance, I liked Phoenicia and it'll be a buy once it becomes available I think. It won't be a regular on the gaming table, but I think it's different enough and brings enough to the table in terms of adequate theme and testing the players in multiple ways to be worth a spot in my collection.

Should mention too, there are a number of graphic design glitches on this game. Nothing too serious, but the advantages on the tech cards could have been much clearer, and the rates on the production cards can be confusing. Not a show-stopper, but this really should have been done better. Complaints about the rules seem greatly overblown. If they have a flaw, it's the in-lined examples which break up the flow a bit too much. They're a little terse (perhaps too terse), but everything is in there and pretty clear.

A simple version of Outpost/Sceptor of Zavandor that plays quickly.  The problem with the simple/quick thing is that the game feels incomplete.

An okay game that doesn't inspire me. The graphics on the cards are poor. The important information is hard to read unless you are really close. The scoring track on the board could also be bigger and clearer. The rest of the space is largely wasted and the fold goes right through some of the illustrations. Finally, does this game have a runaway leader problem? I've not played it enough to know for sure but it looks that way.

This has a very similar vibe to St. Petersburg but with a ton more chrome - tech trees, auctions, worker placement. But the concept is the same: get the money flowing to get more money flowing then shift into VP harvesting at just the right time then win (or lose). It has the same arc of so many games of this type - a story that I find pretty bland. I'm not opposed to small decisions in a game, but the uniformity of decision size - i.e. all small - is irksome. I prefer games to come with a mix of decision sizes. Snowball games tend to be a series of small decisions that accrete over the course of a game. This is not really very interesting to me. Compound that with the fact that there is no point at which the size of the decision you are making isn't itself obvious. Not only is nothing significant at stake at each decision point, but you are made painfully aware of it. There are certainly 'big' moments when you buy just the right card, but they are typically not big decisions. In fact, these 'big' moments are often non-decisions because of how obvious they are. Despite all the chrome, the game lacks even an interesting engine-building aspect. The tech tree is just a bland series of discounts on the next level. No combinations here. No engine. Just money to money to points conversion. In fact, this is what reminded me most of St. Pete. Flat, bland, obvious. You choose this route, that is your strength, you buy the next level. Yay. Did I say bland?

The randomness - in the goods cards values and in the auction availability - really puts the nail in the coffin. In conjunction with a capricious turn-order mechanism (for all but the leader), the randomness determines much of the game, not the players.

I really would like to rate this game higher.  It seems like a really interesting game, but something about it just didn't click with me.  It might be that it is hard to approach; you might have to play it several times before you really understand the consequences of the various paths of development that you can bid on.  It might be that it
seemed like, on the other hand, you were so limited in other choices because of the scarcity of the little pawn people.

Make sure to read the FAQ on BGG.  The rules can be confusing and seem to miss certain points clarified by the FAQ.

Our second play was less confusing but every bit as tight and frustrating.  Types of improvements are severely limited, resulting in tough choices about when to spend and when to save.  Our first play revealed what we thought might be a significant runaway leader problem.  Our second game proved this to be untrue.  I was behind every turn but two until the final turn then won by 3 points.  There are several viable strategies, all equally hard to select from and plan for.

I certainly appreciated that it played faster than Zavendor. But for some reason I didn't feel the same tension (only 1 play). I don't even remember Zavendor very well, but I don't even understand why there needs to be money cards of varying values here. You can't really just play this once (even though I did) and have a good opinion, because the experience of the game comes with understanding the things you can buy/build, a la Puerto Rico, et al. I'm actually finding that I'm caring less and less for games in that mold these days. Maybe it's a phase. Dunno.

One partial play at Spiel 2007. Phoenicia got my attention because of the fact that it dealt with 'development' of an 'ancient Meditteranean civilisation'—yes, I know that's corny and overused and what-not, but still, I like it because it's a fascinating subject. I was expecting something of a mini-Civilization, but instead found that it was an economic engine-type game. With one or two exceptions, I am not terribly good at these, so my interest dropped a few notches while the explanation proceeded. I specifically disliked the random money card draw which saw one of my opponents slowly pulling away, and fortunately my girlfriends suggested we break off the game after the first 'age'. This might or might not be a good auctioning game, but all I know is that it is not for me.

[b]Update[/b] I was able to play Phoenicia again thanks to an effort to get all my games and those of a friend played in alphabetical order. I was able to pinpoint more correctly what it was about (snowball) and consequently was also able to play a bit more clever than when I first encountered the game. But my fellow players and I didn't much care for it in the end. The artwork on the cards makes it hard to figure out what is going on there; and the rulebook isn't the best. Now this sort of thing will resolve itself upon further plays, but the question remains 'for what?'. The splitting out of money and VP is clever and somewhat clunky at the same time; same goes for the incessant worker shuffling to squeeze more efficiency from the proceedings. Now I'm not particularly fond of this type of game, and prefer matters to be clear and straightforward. Ageing St. Petersburg still has my preference then; and perhaps even (at the time of writing) upstart Splendor. And when it comes to bidding I think I also like the author's earlier offering Pizarro & Co. better. Phoenicia doesn't seem to fit anywhere in my preferences.

The rate is a tad low because overall it isn't all bad, but the somewhat unclear and busy artwork, coupled to the fiddliness of managing your own stuff, do cause my appreciation to drop.

This game is primarily about auctions with a good dose of money management involved.  The theme is very much pasted on, but the cards and board are attractive.

I'm more fond of this than Sceptre of Zavandor, I think, though I couldn't say exactly why. Perhaps because there's not the distraction of the special powers tracks - it's more obviously a game about the auctions? But it might just be because I haven't played it as much, so it's fresher to me.

Lots of comments about the opacity of the rule book, but the Nova rules cure that problem. Just download them. The designer has developed a clever mechanism by having cumulative income level and victory points on each of the occupation cards. This can be a bit confusing at first, but allows for cross checking during the game.

The first few auctions are critical to setting up your economic engine, so pay attention to those. It may even pay to ignore the first auction and upgrade your hunters to get farmers instead and start your economic engine going.

Too much diversity in your tableau will hurt you in the long run, but you can not ignore what others are doing. You may have to sacrifice during an auction to hold back the leader.

Overall, really like the game for its depth and for the time to play, usually under an hour. Scales well.

While there are certainly a number of production paths to victory, this game is all about the auctions. It takes a couple plays to get a feel for the value of things in different contexts. (There's also a value to saving some money to be in a dominant position for the following round.)

I'm not a huge fan of the auction mechanic, but the auctions  here are tight and tense and the game builds nicely toward an exciting finish. (As long as no one was allowed a major early advantage.)

There are some odd production choices in the board and card layout, and the rules aren't great (but they're OK, contrary to a lot of the complaints)... but for an auction game, this is a great choice. Off the top of my head, only Santiago has more fun auctions (but the auctions here are deeper and more significant). EDIT: Discovered Homesteaders... it also has great auctions.

Update: Now I own both Scepter and Outpost, so this game doesn't have as much to offer me.  It is quicker, but the streamlining makes the runaway leader problem more prevalent.

Acquire cards at auction that give you workers or facilities or otherwise enhance your ability to produce. Use the enhanced production to create more income to buy better cards and to place more workers in production, which will generate more income to buy even better.... You get the picture. Been there. Done that. And in more interesting games. The rules can cause much furrowing of the brow. It's best to read the FAQs before your first game or, better yet, to have someone teach you the game.

I worry about the long term replayability, since the same cards come up every time.  At least, I worry that the same groups would settle on the same values for items and the game could become stagnant.  I also worry that a second discount of a type is actually better for a person because it tends to keep others out of the bidding on the bigger discounted items, and is therefore worth overbidding on.  These worries aside, I enjoyed the game a good deal, and am looking forward to playing again (and trying the other variations).

I like that Phoenicia is shorter than its two older brothers, Outpost and Scepter of Zavandor, but it still is a bit too fiddly for me.  There is also a run-away leader problem since an early lead turns into more income, which turns into a greater lead.  This run-away leader problem is especially bothersome when 1 player received 6 money on their first 3 cards (it happens to 1 in 9 players (in other words, quite often)) and another player receives a couple of 4 money cards.  That difference compounded for 10 turns can turn into a HUGE difference in scores.

There is basically one rule to this game but it is buried underneath the most poorly written rulebook I own so it seems complex.  Once you get through the rules (and make some up because there are two buildings not covered in them) you find that you are incredibly bored.  Very narrow obvious tech trees, a city building game where it is near impossible to get workers, an awful scoring track when there is clearly room for a better (double) one, and some inconsistent symbol use on cards land this game on the crap pile.

RATING: 6
After 2 plays, the jury is out on this.  In both games, a player has gotten storage screwed.  The player is essentially eliminated on the final 2 turns...and can do nothing.  I'll start it at a 7 for now because it is otherwise a lot of fun.  It is definitely several notches below Scepter of Zavendor.  It doesn't offer as many strategic choices.  Everything is pretty much a no-brainer decision.  The toughest choices are how much to bid in turns 2-4.  The correct value probably depends on what other people (later in the turn) do plus what cards come up next turn.  Unfortunately, neither of these can be predicted easily.  But it does play quicker, and I suppose that is what many people want.
**Downgrading from 7 --> 6 after another play.  The game just seems to be missing something.  Because of the random way cards come out, any strategy you plan is totally dependent on the draw of the cards.  You can end up getting locked out of the last couple of turns if things go wrong.**

Players are developing a civilization, paying attention to their economy to ensure rapid growth.  Essentially a series of auctions of civilization cards ("Prospector", "Caravan", etc), that awards victory points, economic growth and possible discounts and access to future cards.  A game where you have to carefully watch your "money" (amphoras, while the coin symbols are victory points!) to plan your purchases so you don't get left behind - which is easily done via a casual purchase.  Nice game - very quick with two players.  I think this will shine with 4-5 players.

In my opinion, a brilliant and under-appreciated game -- manages to compress the experience of Outpost or Scepter of Zavindor (both of which I greatly enjoy!) into half the time, /without/ decreasing the depth of the game, which is an impressive feat of design!

RATING: 8
Yet another great title by Lehman, a jack-of-all trades designer who really deserves more recognition. 

The goal is to accumulate the most victory points, but cranking up your little economic engine to produce tons of money isn't always the best way to score points. Fun and not too convoluted, I like this quite a bit. I'm really glad this is out there given the expense of Outpost and the bizzare theme of Zavander.

Good news to everyone: you can play three games of PHOENICA instead of one game of SCEPTER OF ZAVANDOR taking the same amount of time!

An incomprehensible rule book is inexcusable. And this one is completely incomprehensible.  The designer came up with The City a few years later, which is a similar game but plays in 10 minutes and, the auction apart, seems to do what this does more elegantly. 
Definite runaway leader problem here.

Got a copy in a math trade. Looking forward to playing my first game. Heard it was like Scepter of Zavandor, but shorter. Game wasn't that good looking compared to Scepter of Zavandor, reason why I traded Phoenicia. Wasn`t really great to look like, was a bit disappointed.

Got Phoenicia and Scepter of Zavandor in the same math trade.

great disappointment for me. very limited, **stripped down** version of outpost. Removed most of the specialization, varied routes to victory, long term planning, and ultimately the angst that made outpost great. what's left is a routine auction game, where you do the usual calculate the price of the item up for bid vs. increasing your production. So many better auction games out there. PLAY BEFORE YOU BUY!! DO NOT SELL OUTPOST expecting to replace it with this version.

Simplified Scepter of Zavandor (which I would prefer to play any day) that has an incredible runaway leader problem that forces other players to "take one for the team" through defensive bidding, however, once someone slips through the net, they can be impossible to catch. The game really is then pointless.

Mmm...  My first three player game did not yield a favourable impression.  I fear the rich get richer way too easily in Phoenicia and there is little in the way of how to catch up.  Since this is an auction game, who ever generates more income usually ends up with more means to control the auction cycle, pulling the leaders beyond reach quickly.  The relative scarcity of workers seems to favor the ones who acquire the Towers.  Not unwilling to try it again, but not in a hurry to do so.

Best game so far was a four player game.  A well balanced game, though not universally well played.  I'm really enjoying this game now.  I'm a little concerned about how thin the theme is, but that could be biased by expectations.  Update 01/09/10 - played five player, probably my favorite experience playing the game so far.  The theme didn't seem quite as thin but the money manipulations that happen now that I actually understand the rules make the game much tighter.

This is a very good game. Its Outpost heritage is clear to see but it is better rounded, quicker and with more tough decisions to make each round. Money is always tight which makes for considerable angst. Two negatives though. First,an early mistake can put a player out of the running. Not so much a problem of a runaway leader which is good. Secondly, the card graphics are not at all helpful - far too much space is devoted to the pretty picture at the expense of important writing/icons which are far too small. Why on earth do the icons depicting money and victory points have to be the same colour and hard to distinguish? Such a basic piece of design to get wrong and so unnecessary. However, the game itself is a definite winner.

RATING: 9
This game is waaaay underrated. Just make sure you print out the superior user-created rulebook on BGG and ignore the one that comes with the game. Further, spend some extra time understanding the UI so you don't make mistakes later. 

With that out of the way, I love the pacing of this game. Playing this game is an exhilarating slingshot. Not a slingshot made of twine and a leather pouch. I mean slingshot as in loping around a planet to send your strategy awesomely into orbit. It's the perfect length at ninety minutes. Out of all the games I have, it's the first one that I wanted to play again immediately after my first game (that wasn't a really quick game anyway like Love Letter or the Battle for Hill 218). 

Everyone is snowballing in this game, and you have to make sure your choices keep you on track to get those city walls and trade fleets up by the end of the game. However, the auctions aren't so confusing that new players are stricken with analysis paralysis, desperately trying to place a value on something. The income gives you a little variance, but not too much. There are also some catchup mechanics. The discount cards pit the players off against one another in neat ways. I love this game!

I wish there were some more cards I could swap in to make the deck a little different every now and then. 

The prospect of explaining the UI prevents it from being a 10 for me.

RATING: 4
Downgraded after my second play.  Multiple paths of victory, but it seems like if you end up on the same path as someone else you both lose.  

More significant are two related issues: it's an unforgiving game and the runaway leader.

Unforgiving: a bad move early in the game can leave you in a position of having little or no chance to win.  There's no risky play you can make to possibly make up ground, and you can't do much to affect the leader either.  Just bid up his items, but if you get stuck with something he wants you just sink yourself further.

Runaway leader: as with any game with a runaway leader, there is a simple solution.  Don't let him get ahead!  

These two are related issues since this is a 'snowball' game.  If you don't start your snowball correctly, good luck catching up.  If someone gets a cheap tile or two early on, he could have the whole game wrapped up in phase 1 (out of 4).  Perhaps that's just the nature of snowball games.

It would not be as big of a deal if it were easier to determine the 'appropriate' values of the items being auctioned.  Or at least ballpark values.  I'm sure the game would be great if as a group we reached the level of understanding the values, but we'd need to play several more times, I think.  With so many other games competing for table time, I doubt we'll reach that level with Phoenicia.

Actually, this might all come down to the fact that this game is too hard for me.

RATING: 7
Good solid auction-type Euro, which was compared by one of our regulars as a light version of Civilization. But the rules!? I won't expect such a rule set from any reasonably competent amateur, let alone a professional publisher. What you need to play the game is there, somewhere, but you are left with the impression that providing players with a clear and complete rules set was not all that important to the designer. We played the game 4 times so far and we are still left with questions. For example, have you ever seen a symbol heavy board game that doesn’t explain their meaning? Or doesn’t provide you with a diagram of the board itself? At least half the time we spent on our first game was taken up with deciphering the various symbols and arguing about the meaning of the various rules. And this was not about a few obscure rules at the end of the book but how the game basically worked. On the other hand, even after this experience we had a good enough time to try it again. So there is something there. It just requires you to spend time the publisher didn't in developing the game. I'd suggest printing up all the FAQs, comments and explanations you can find before attempting such a task.

UPDATE: Besides having a rulebook that seems to have been sent through a food processor rather than a word processor, the game also suffers from a leader problem. If the typical game lasts say 6 to 8 turns and whoever is ahead by turn 4 inevitably wins, why play beyond turn 4?

It's miles away from Race for the Galaxy although you can notice some similarities between these two. The rulebook is definitely not sufficient to start a normal game - it leaves so many unanswered questions that it's surprising for a designer of this magnitude. After you crawl through the details Phoenicia turns out to be a good game. But the first impression still stands...

Punishingly tight auction-driven snowball economic game that sprints across a thin tightrope. One small waver in the early game can determine the winner, but when and how this waver comes into being is perplexing, even in hindsight. Works very well with 2, and that might be my preferred player count.

Homemade 2-player version for when not playing friend's legit retail copy.

Phoenicia's economic system is too simplistic.  There aren't enough interesting things to do with your money, and as a result the game feels confining and just . . . boring.  Players' fates are too tightly lashed to the random ordering of the development cards.  The game components (board, cards, tiles, markers) are ugly and look and feel cheap.  The iconography is confusing and the rules contain no explanation of what the various cards do - really an inexcusable blunder.  Zepter von Zavandor, though far from perfect, beats Phoenicia in pretty much every category.  I guess I don't see a reason for this game to exist.

The comparision to The Sceptre of Zavandor is similar in the sense that you build up your economy by winning development cards in auctions and these cards gives you better economy etc. The only worry is that it might be difficult to catch the leader (which really is true in a 2-player game), but on the other hand it's relatively short. It has an initial threshold, as you need to understand the significance of the different development cards. In any case it fulfilled my expectations and I hopre to play this a lot.

I don’t think Phoenicia gets the love that it deserves here on the geek. There are a few games that pack as many decisions in such short time frame as Phoenicia do. It is basically bidding and developing game and you got to know how much things are worth and will be worth. The game is not as number crunching as eg. Scepter of Zavandor, but instead, the relatively large increments can make it less forgiving. There has been said that there is a runaway leader problem with the game, but it isn’t as bad as some say it is. While it is a build your economy type of game there are several ways to do it and a discount can make a player that looks like he is behind catch up.

I have played this a ton on JKLM Interactive, and it held up for a long time. I don't say I'm done with it, but things are beginning to be a little deterministic after this many games with the same people.

It works fine for any number of players, even though I prefer it slightly more with 3 or 4 players. In a five player game, it can become a little chaotic depending on what comes out and the bidding. With two players, if both are equally proficient, the first player will have a definite edge since he can control the bidding in the important first round.

RATING: 4
After my first play, I felt that this was a timing game, but not a terrible one.  If everybody is playing well, it's easy to come from behind for most of the game, except in the last turn, but then at least the game is over quickly and you don't have to spend an hour knowing that you're going to lose.  But after a second play, I feel this is a game where if someone makes a bad move, it could give a huge advantage to another player, making them into a runaway winner with the other players powerless to affect the outcome for the rest of the game.  I'm highly disinclined to play the game again for this reason -- it's too easy for someone else to (inadvertently) screw up your plans so completely that you can't recover and you leave the game feeling frustrated.

In general, what is critical in this game is developing enough production, having enough warehouses to hold the cards to win late auctions (for big-point buildings), and having enough workers early in the game to give you all that production.  (You can win with few workers as long as you have good jobs for them, like Mining or Clothmaking.)

Upgrades give some bonus to future purchases, but are not critical.  However, it's important not to give two of certain upgrades to the same player.  For example, if one player has both of the two trackers, they'll get to buy 2/1 Hunters for 2 coins each, which is a great deal!  Also, two dyers give a 7-coin discount to the dye house, which can be a game-breaking discount.  And two City Centres leads to a 7-coin discount to Public Works, each of which is worth 5 points, and multiple Public Works can lead to a 4-/7-/9-coin discount to the big 8-point City Walls.  It may come down to this: getting a City Centre in order to get 5 VPs/Public Works may be the key to winning the game.

An auction/tech tree game off the Outpost family, this is a nicely done game by Tom Lehmann which shows some careful thought behind the design.

The plastic pieces from JKLM are a bit trashy, but on the whole the gaem is nice, and the rules easier to understand than the common report.

Based on one solo play I'll give this a 7, then ding it .25 for the plastic bits, which would have been nicer if wood, though much heavier.  Still a nice game with some climbing possible.

After some more solo plays with differing numbers of players, and reading a bit about other takes on Phoenicia, I'm going to knock this down to a 6.5.

It definitely is not as interesting for 2 as for 4-5, and the play seems to follow a track where the greatest income => winner, though I've a game or two where it was close between those focusing more on straight points than on just bread-winning and buying big point cards in auction.  

In the last auctions the 'money men' seem to be better able to pull in the big point cards (esp. City Walls) and tie up a win, even if it means climbing from behind in the point standing.  Not terrible, but I'm growing more interested in Zavandor and the Stronghold reprint of Outpost than in lots more plays of Phoenicia.

RATING: 2
For a 'super-light' civilization game, the game looks interesting in terms of components and artwork, but it comes short in terms of depth, immersion, and mechanics. The key to winning the game is upping the production, so as to get more money, which allows you to bid (and get) for more production cards (and future credits for more powerful cards), which sometimes come concurrently with victory points. Rinse and repeat. This game suffers from a "runaway" leader syndrome--once a player has more production (and hence money), there is no way to catch up. The game is deceptively simple: bid on one of four cards, train your workers to up production, and collect your money/VP. That's it. There are no innovative mechanics here. The play is so simplistic that I don't feel like I'm building anything--I'm collecting plastic meeples on production cards. The board game is a waste of real-estate--it is essentially an income and VP track, surrounding a pseudo-technology tree, and some matrix to keep track of future credits. What's the point? I suppose the ability for a player to invoke several auctions in one turn is interesting, in terms of finessing play, but I was too frustrated with the poorly written rules to care. It took four hours to play a 4 player game (with 3 newbies, plus one player who hadn't played in years). The game is fidgety in terms of setup--20+ minutes (maybe the owner should have segregated the pieces and cards beforehand), and took too long to explain the rules--45 minutes, for what is essentially a bid, play, and collect game. Truly disappointing and frustrating first-time experience.

Update-Having read the reviews on the Geek, it seems my issues are justified, except that as newbies, we all didn't know what appropriate value to bid on a given card, so in some cases there was overspending, while on others, we let a good card get away cheaply. The game should have flowed more quickly, but we were constantly distracted by looking up the rules, and deeply impacted by the lack of understanding of the card-limit rules (I had the granary, but two others did not, so could they expand their hand limit beyond two houses? No, initially, but yes later). So, I'll consider trying this again, and we'll see how the bidding goes, which reminds me of Vegas Showdown or Hollywood Blockbuster. But I agree with the comments that this is not a newbie-friendly game, especially if it is not taught well the first time.

Update (01/26/2011): Who am I kidding? Never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

Update (11/28/2014): Now, that I have [thing=1491]Outpost[/thing], I'd rather play that--better immersive theme. Still, it too suffers from runaway leader syndrome.

This is a decent auction game that suffers from the same thing as nearly all auction games in that new players don't know how to value things.

After several plays new strategies emerge but this still needs to be played multiple times with the same group to work.

This is surprisingly good with 2p also.

Dear oh, is this what we've got to expect from games in future? It's mechanically very simple: auction something then re-arrange your workers, but thematically suspect, how can you 'buy' your way to a better civilization? The card 'combos' created by the tech tree are pretty obvious, but why should I bid to stop someone else getting a killer upgrade, if another player won't? The board is a complete waste, this could have worked as a card game, and plastic bits instead of wood? Don't get me started.

Brutal.  As others have said, it's easy to lose early, but at least once one player seizes control, the game is likely to end relatively soon. I love that it's less unwieldy than Scepter but in many ways it is a very different and much tighter game.  

I'm determined to make the mining strategy work. Eventually. As I said when I was playing: "I always do this, and it always makes me lose."

There are multiple paths to victory that take several plays to discover --beginners should just focus on getting into Mining or Clothmaking to take the most obvious path. Definitely rewards experience --the more plays under your belt, the better you'll do. Well balanced and staged deck. Game changes a lot with different numbers of players.

RATING: 7.5
This is an ugly unloved auction game with very little else to it.  Try to win a card that gives you special advantages.  Build up production to get money, victory points to win.  Is effectively a solo game where you auction cards and try to dominate wins, forcing other players to be at a disadvantage.  Feels dry and soulless, but needs to be tested first, just in case.

Wow! Did I ever judge this game wrong. Did a solo run through with 5 player count and really enjoyed this, even though all it is is an auction game. All you do is auction technology cards, then do a bunch of solitaire actions (zero player interaction), then take money and action again. Despite my avid dislike for auctions, this game plays fantastically and is a great little civ builder. It's main problem is that it's SOOOOO ugly, no one is willing to give it a chance to shine. A good game that I'm keeping

Feb09: Well, I got to play it.  How was it?  Not bad.  It's *almost* worth playing some more.

What it was really missing was a nice hook.  It did everything right, but it just was kinda boring.  There was a nice struggle between VP and Income.  And the cards all seemed fairly balanced and yet pleasantly different.  Unfortunately, it's more just damning with faint praise I think.

The components are very questionable and the published rules are rough.  I can get over those issues though.

My one play had *very* close scores too, which is nice.  But I just don't think it was awesome enough to want to play many times.

I'm going to try and give it at least one more go before I send it out the door.

Mar09: Multiple plays didn't quite do it for me.  It just was too dry and still felt a little too much on wheels.

Played only once.  I really liked this first experience.  I do see the strong similarities in game mechanics to Scepter but feel it is different enough for me that I will own both.  I liked the way things are tallied for you in Phoenicia.  However, even though Scepter is long the theme feels more "real" to me than that of Phoenicia.  For me when I play Scepter I do feel somewhat like a mage/wizard where as in Phoenicia I never really felt like I was fostering a civilization.  As such, I will still play Scepter whenever I can convince 4 or more to play.

This game moves over a lot of territory covered by other games.  Its basically a boardgame implementation of a resource/technology tree.  It has some needlessly fiddly systems, like money.  It has almost no way to stop a runaway leader -- which is easy enough to accomplish, and I think as the game evolved from Outpost, it adapted several artificialities from the space theme and applied them to a ancient trading theme -- artificialities that do not make sense in context.  It is not devoid of redeeming value, but it did not sit well with me either.

RATING: 6
After 1 play.

I've got mixed feelings.  It's interesting blend of optimizing your economy with auctions for cards allowing it.  BUT there are some issues:
- the game feels too restricted (you can't do much in your turn; and in the scale of the whole game - there so many spaces for workers, while realistically you will only use a few of them)
- balance of investing directly in cards and in sending your workers to specific areas might be skewed -> investing in cards seems superior
- most importantly - there might occur snowball effect (or 'rich get richer' syndrome)

I might give it another try, because it's not an intuitive game and some of my conclusions might turn out to be false.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
initial rating 1 play 4 players

Well I haven't played Zepter yet and if this is all it has to offer but in a longer version I really no longer feel compelled (although apparently the theme stands out more in that title but I'm not sure that will cut it anymore). 

Dry, dry, dry as this really is NOT a Civ game and theme is barely there. Repetitive as in buy something then upgrade, buy something then upgrade, etc... which is ALL the game is and this all became boring all too quickly as the game really lacked decisions and the tension/angst that should go with them. Now while you could label that fault of buying and upgrading is all the game is on some other quite notable titles, those games really stand out in some areas where this game did not. 

Components - all the complaints already noted by other people are valid and while I normally don't give a crap this just doesn't measure up anymore in today's standards so it adds insult to injury for this title. 

Other things to note: 

 - Rich get richer...check. Not much anyone can do as money drives the game and everything is bought in an auction, people with more money buy better things 

 - Slightly fiddly...check

 - Auctions lacked tension...check

 - Fun factor...non existent

Bottom line - So far I think this game has been done much better just about everywhere else and doesn't measure up in todays competitive game market with so much to choose from. 10 years ago this may have been a 7 but today there are already much better auction/economic engine games to play and this offers nothing new. While it doesn't do anything devastatingly wrong (save maybe runaway leader) it really fails to shine in any given area so I'd rather play GOA than come back to this. 

Please note: This is an initial rating only and possibly being more familiar with the cards might help future plays but I have my doubts as a straight economic ladder climbing game with nothing else added isn't my favourite Genre. Also seeing what Morgan D said about playing with 4 makes me want to try this again with only 3. This might be better suited for even quicker online play

Interesting remake of Scepter von Zavandor. Components are a bit bland, and the game is overpriced (I paid the equivalent of $80 for the game)!

The game is a simple auction/production game. The criticism of the rules is (for once) warranted; the rules by themselves are almost incomprehensible (and I LOVE rules reading and have been doing it for more than 25 years), with important information sometimes being hidden in examples, if not outright missing. Criminal neglect, since Phoenicia is quite a simple game at heart.

The game itself is fun. Very strategic (in the sense that you have to have a long-term plan in order to do well) and a bit dry. The theme isn't particularly strong and while it feels a bit pasted on, at least it fits the mechanics well enough. With 5 players there is a strong sense of both runaway-leader and no-coming-back-from-behind issues.

My initial impression is good but I am not blown away. My '7' could probably become an '8' with more experience of the various strategies and a better understanding of the depth of the game.

To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about this game. I bought it and played it once, however I remember it came with a lot of plastic and that I did like it. I plan to read the rules (as the first explainer was unsure about many rules).

For now I`m rating it a 6.0 so it matches my current feelings toward the game with BGG´s recommended rating system. An ok game that I want to play sporadically. I will play it soon again to properly comment on it.

I finally played Phoenicia again, and I liked it!

I read the rules and, in general, they are easy to grasp, however there are some parts in the rulebook that are badly redacted and that makes them harder to learn. Lehmann´s rulebooks are generally this way or perhaps it is Rio Grande games who redact the rulebooks this way (I also read RFTG: Alien Artifacts this week and I also had some doubts due to redaction), but all the information is there. You have to read and re-read to understand. Once you know the rules, you can explain them under 10 minutes, they are easy and intuitive!

The art is ok. The game components are functional and good looking. The game board is, perhaps, superfluous. Its main function is to mark how much you produce each turn and how many VPs you have. It could have been a lot smaller. Its graphic design is regular and could have been a lot better.

Playtime is around 90 minutes and it plays best with 3 players.

The theme is ok. I like ancient civilizations, but you don’t feel it thought the game other than in the tech tree cards (which I enjoy).

The decisions needed in the game aren’t trivial. You have to decide how much you are going to bid for the technology cards and that’s not obvious in most cases. This is also the core of the game, it is, almost, a pure auction game.

I’m worried that (perhaps) the first player has a very unfair disadvantage? I’m still not sure about this. I’m also worried that getting workers can be impossible for a player. In my last game I only played with 3 workers during my whole game. The other players had much more money than me so I always got the worst card available and they always got the ones that came with more workers. I didn’t do so bad, so perhaps this is not as issue. I need more plays to verify. I have one more worry, I think that the game can have a runaway leader problem. I will also verify this with more plays. 

I feel luck plays only a minor role (other than being the first player). In average I think all the players will draw the same value of cards so luck will screw with you intermittently.

Bottom line, I like Phoenicia. It plays relatively fast and its decisions are quite interesting vs the length of the game. It can even get an upgraded rating from me with more plays. For now I will keep Phoenicia in my game collection but my desire to play it again soon isn’t very high.

After muddling through the rules and getting a few answers here at BGG, we finally played a game.  I still find the rules ambiguous in places, with missing descriptions.  A complete rewrite, with MANY more examples of play would be more than welcome. (Note:  The rewrite posted here on BGG clears up many, but not all of the problems that we had with the game)

Another problem is the fact that there are absolutely NO player aids.  Even a simple sheet with descriptions of all of the cards/tiles would have been a great help for new players.  The back page of the rulebook was passed from player to player to player all game long.

My first impression... the game sorely lacks a mechanism to stop a runaway leader.  I'm sure that everyone at the table last week would play the game slightly different next time, but one person managed to gain an extra production card in one round and never looked back... by the end of the game his closest rival was over 15 points behind.

The leader ALWAYS chooses first, so he picked the best items... then kept bidding until no one else could top him.  Many times he had enough cash to do this two times, leaving one or two of the other players without a card that round!  And it just kept getting worse from there.  With enough houses to keep his hand size large, no one else could compete (even if they held onto their cards from one round to the next)!

I am not fond of games that appear to have runaway leaders... I have more fun when everyone appears to have a chance at winning right up to the final turns.  Sadly, this isn't the case with Phonecia.

After a couple of more plays, I've found that if everyone knows the game, it's a bit closer, but a runaway leader can still be a BIG problem.  My rating has increased, marginally... to a '6.'

RATING: 5
Rating is very tentative, based on about 5 plays thus far.  This is one of those games that was literally played to death in the first two weeks or so, after it came out, then everyone (including me) seemed to lose interest very quickly.  Mean to be a short-playing version of Outpost, the game is SO short as to make it really uninteresting.  Zeptor von Zavender (sp?) is probably the best Outpost-type game out there, mainly because it goes the furthest to fix what I believe to be a serious runaway leader problem in the original game.  Phoenicia, I fear, does not fix that problem, hence I doubt it will be played that often.

By runaway leader problem, I mean something like this:  There's one great card out there, and one player drew a "6" card while everyone else drew a "5."  That player wins the bidding because of the luck factor of drawing a "6" card, he (she) gains an unassailable advantage and coasts to victory.  Other games with similar problems that, in my view, "break he game," include St. Petersburg, where the first Orange player who gets a Mistress of Judge in turn 1 or 2 usually can coast to an easy win.

After only one play, I feel that this game is a weak 7. The reason is mostly due to one player in our 4 player game that fell far behind, so it felt like a rich gets richer, poor gets poorer type of game. However I the more experienced gamers tied for first in the game so it's probably not a problem if the players are familiar with the game... time will tell... but I can't see this rating increase a full integer, but it might be a strong seven.

Tentative rating. Seemed like a good build-your-engine game, but also seemed in my first play to have a serious runaway leader problem. Maybe this isn't normally a problem, maybe it's just a problem with 3 players, maybe it's just a problem when only 1 of 3 is familiar with the game.

Someone must have taken these components directly from the leftovers of some 70's game. I haven't played with plastic pawns in this millenium before. And why did they take plastic for everything else as well? Wooden cubes can't be that expensive if everybody else is taking them. 
Enough for the rant. Behind the hideous outside a streamlined economic snowball game is hiding. Players can follow various development paths which are pursued by winning auctions for workers, upgrades and production buildings. The good news is that different paths are viable, the auctions work fine as a balancing mechanism. A slight random element is introduced by production cards ranging from 4 to 6. In the first one or two rounds bad luck on the draws could make a difference considering the snowball effects. Once familiar with the game, it should play out in 60 to 90 minutes. If you don't mind the problems associated with the genre, Phoenicia is a solid choice.

I think this is a neat game with some good mechanisms, I just think it is very prone to a runaway if people don't do things like stop someone from getting 2 dye houses.  Some argue that "Well, then players should be aware of this", and it can still happen, and at that point the last 2/3 of the game is just playing out the string.  Just a "meh" game because of that.

A economic snowball grind, and not of the good kind. A horribly processional affair compared to the closest relative, Scepter of Zavandor.

After seeing how JKLM butchered Phoenicia with their amateurish production and incredibly bad graphic design, I find it incredible that any designer would give their game to them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I must join the chorus of disapproval for the rules.  I think some of the "I read the rules once and instantly understood the game" people must have prior experience with Outpost or Scepter of Zavandor.  It was hard for me to pinpoint exactly what makes the rules hard to digest.  I think it's just that I could not picture how the game was played - more examples would help, maybe a more comprehensive list of what the cards do.  I'm glad we have BGG, as some time spent here cleared things up.

Once you understand, the game is quite easy to play.  It can be taught quite easily, though I would caution that a new player would almost always lose out to an experienced one.  I can see how a runaway leader problem could easily exist, though hopefully when playing with experienced players it could be avoided once players are familiar with the cards.  I really like this system - money is very tight and every decision matters.  It plays so quickly, too!  With 3 players we played two games in a row (including initial rules explanation) in under 2 hours.

I'm not a big fan of the theme (boring), but I prefer it to the Scepter of Zavandor fantasy theme.  I like how there is a fine line that you must walk between acquiring storage for your production, acquiring workers and trying to push up your production and victory point levels.  There is a little bit of randomness and someone could get the short end of the stick in the potential money distribution (getting a bunch of 4s), but in general I don't have a problem with that.  My one concern is that the game could become scripted with certain dominant strategies.  I would like to explore this game and investigate different strategies.  So far the dye house/clothmaking seems like a very efficient way of bumping up production early enough to gear up for the big VP items at the end.

RATING: 4
I didn't care for this. I've only had one play, the group had some difficulty learning the rules, and this created some tension in the group that made that particular play unpleasant. But setting that aside as best I can, I didn't find Phoenicia all that interesting.

The main action centers around bidding for cards that give you victory points, or production points, or powerful structures, or discounts on some future cards, or some combination of those. You need to manage a balance between victory points and production level. It's a nice idea to have this second major variable running on the the victory point that is not victory points. So you have this combination of bidding, resource conversion, and balancing your need for production with the need for victory points. That's quite tricky, especially with the bidding. 

And I found it really boring. This is a euro game that some people will like a great deal, and I can see why they would like, but one that I found dull. There just wasn't a lot of opportunities to play creatively and adapt to what others were doing. As the game progressed it was clear what kinds you should bid for, so long as you could afford them. And if you couldn't you were stuck. So you build an engine but then you get locked to that engine and that lock kept getting tighter as the game progressed. 

Also, it seemed like the game had a runaway leader problem. This may have been because it was the first play for three of the five players, or simply because that's the nature of engine building games. Even so, it seemed that if you fall too far behind you could get stuck (which happened to a couple players) with no chance of catching up. With everyone at a reasonable skill level this might be mitigated. But I'm not likely to play this again, so I'll never know. 

This is an engine building game. This was likely one of the best ones when it was published, but today there are better ones. So this is a pass for me.

Played twice at GenCon '07 with 3 players.
Gave it a second chance, game doesn't seem very balanced, if someone is left behind early game, it's next to impossible to catch-up. Rules are a nightmare. Game needs a major tweak. Game has some redeeming quality since I wanted to play it a second time.

Phoenicia is unforgiving of mistakes and requires knowledge of the deck to play well, but with other good players it becomes the apogee of auction games: pure brinksmanship. I love it. (Also I like coercing refugees into joining my city, then promptly sending them down the mines.)

Rather enjoyable civ-themed bidding game with a few details to think about, can get pretty tense. New players should be informed about the importance of early gains in production (as I feel the "city centers for VP's" strategy is more difficult), or there will be a runaway leader.

RATING: 2
Horrible. First the game takes forever. There is a lot of down time. Our 5 player game last 2 hours which is way too much for that kind of game.

Second, the game starts really slow. You can do very little things at the beginning and it takes a lot of turn before you can actually start doing something interesting. 

Personally, I would suggest skipping the first few turns, by giving everybody more production and VP at the start to at least have 2 production cards every turn.

You lack of a lot of resources. You need to manage people but you get so many few of them. So you always buy upgrades and have nothing to manage.

There are buildings that gives discount, but in this game, since these building/tech are acquired by auction, that means that you have an auction rebates. Which makes it very hard for other players to actually do auction with you when you have rebates on the price you are about to pay. So when you have a rebate, it is almost an automatic win unless somebody want to block you.

Keeping track of the VP and the production on the track was very confusing. It looks simple, but many times we had to recount everything to make sure there was no errors. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's kinda interesting when you get the hang of the buildup mechanisms although it is a more solitaire except for the auctions.  It did remind me of a much shorter version of Outpost but doesn't resolve the issue of the "falling behind" problem (just like Outpost, if you "fall behind" in the early game, it is extremely difficult to "come from behind" and win - this seems less of an issue with three players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
In all honesty, I really don't want to play this one again.  This line of games just isn't my cup of tea.  I don't mind a poor decision losing me the game in the early going, but when it was just a random draw of currency cards and realizing soon after that I lost a particular auction 3 turns into the game that I was screwed and had no hope was frustrating.  Tried to go after the leader a couple times, but this game doesn't lend itself well to catching up or stopping a leader since if you aren't competing for a certain tech trail, you feel the need to focus on your own tech trail.  Thankfully, it does play very quickly.

Excellent game for those like like auction/bidding games. I think the money gets a little out of control, and there becomes a point where you are either way in or way out. I want to try and play where the money peeks at 3 or 4 cards and then goes back down to make it feel a little more balanced. That being said, the number of different cards, the bidding, the money cards you can hold all adds up to an awesome game

Graphic design makes it difficult to learn/teach. Examples:
- discs represent tools or coins depending on location
- the treasury has silver and white discs printed, but I don't know why
- VP and production tracks are combined, but there isn't enough room for pieces
- VP scoring track has VP on left and production on right, whereas all cards have VP on right and production on left
- reduced prices could/should be more clear

In general, it looks they tried to cram too much into a small space, and reuse as many components as possible. As such, I never got past the rules even though this is from my favourite game designer.

UPDATE:
Played and the rules actually are not that difficult as long as someone is teaching the game. That said, this isn't really my type of game.

a decent game with a decent tech tree, however the game seems to be lacking something. after a couple of plays it seems like it's just that if you can build up your lead in production that you should win the game... that seems to limit the choices somewhat!

I saw an offer for Phoenicia on Tanga and found out my friend owned a copy. So he brought it over and we tried it out. That first game (a 3 player) was decent and he kindly left it with us to try out as a 2 player. Those games, however, fell rather flat as one player got a slight lead, so began an inevitable cycle toward their victory, as they could always get the card in auction that they wanted (plus they controlled the auction as Overlord and could pick the auction according to their need). So as a player I was either helpless or utterly dominant - neither position is very satisfying. I could see playing it again as a 3 or 4 player game though. That might shake things up so an early lead is not insurmountable.

7/2007 Very interesting card-driven development game.  There's lots of options; but the development cards available for auction, and given what you get, will affect your long term strategies.  Remember the money card distribution; with it you can "guess" how much each player has to spend during auctions.  Money is tight and you don't want to spend too much.  Although we auctioned the development cards slightly wrong on our first play this was an excellent game.  Will play again with correct rules, it might affect my rating.

8/2008 Another play and another issue.  The game has a huge run-away-leader problem.  Rating down 7->6.

RATING: 7
Highly anticipated 90 min civ game, with similarities to Sceptre of Zavandar but shorter. Sounds interesting... [Update] Got to play this at GenCon 2007 and won first game handily. It does indeed play quickly and have a sense of 'progress' and development. It's (brutally) unforgiving - might work well with strong players but if you have mixed talent go for Power Grid instead. That said, it's definitely a good game that rewards careful play. Beware double dye houses!

After one play I have the feeling I like Zepter von Zavandor better for the mechanics and Outpost better for the theme. If you don't know any of these two, than perhaps this is something for you.

After several plays, the redeeming grace of this variant is that it fits a quite short time frame (which can't be said of either Zepter or Outpost).

For this game, a single playing can probably only assert that it works, and works well. A proper test would have to rely on a group who know the game enough to spice up the early auctions, where it is practically impossible to gauge the worth of various assets without former experience.

I’m looking forward to such a second round of Phonicia although it is a rather dry game, since I feel that the sudden death victory can lend a very unique dynamic to what would otherwise be just another well done Euro.

Es un juego de subastas, manejo de recursos, máquina de hacer dinero y puntos.
Probablemente el juego de subastas mas pesado de mi colección.
Es un juego que no tiene downtime, pero es largo. Es un juego que fluye fácil, pero que no perdona errores: una mala decisión inicial puede relegar a dos horas de observador. Eso lo considero un reto y no un defecto.
Por otro lado, es un juego difícil de "agarrar" al principio -puede ser visto como un tanto árido si no se usa el vocabulario temático creado por el autor-, pero curiosamente morigerado por la interacción que dan las subastas y la exquisita sensación que otorga el hecho de ir cada vez compenetrándose mas con las posibilidades que otorga.

10/25/08 Played a three-player game of Phoenicia once. I liked it and look forward to playing it again, hopefully with more people. 01/25/09 A second three-player game. Me thinks we need more players. With three the "rich get richer" mechanism allows one player to easily run away with the game. 11/07/09 Played a four-player game. Having a fourth player made no difference, one player still ran away with the the game. 03/16/13 Played a three-player game and... one player ran away with the game. The card graphics are *very* poor (white pawns/houses on a light gray background, numbers, icons, and words too small, while the almost meaningless artwork takes up 75% of the card). For this reason and the run away leader problem I'm lowering my rating from 7 to 5.

Three plays: the game has a strong "the rich get richer" effect and therefore a runaway leader effect. This seems inevitable given the fact that the further you are ahead on the scoring track, the more income you get, so you can purchase more etc. So, make sure you become the leader right from the start. And another tip: the dye-clothmaker is usually the winning combination.

This game, for me, is what Outpost should have been. It streamlines it into a decent playing time, takes all the niggly annoyances with number cards, and still retains the same sort of feel. A vast improvement on a classic - which incidentally is a game I refuse to ever play again...

Initial rating after 3 2-player games: nice 'civ-lite' card game, that's actually pretty low on theme. Theme fits better than the other 'Outpost variant' Zepter von Zavandor, and the rulebook is a lot better. Game plays faster too, so Zavandor can probably go on the tradepile.

Will have to play it with more to be sure how good it is.

I'd be willing to give it another try, but I'm not dying to play it again.

After a couple frustrating attempts, I finally cracked the code (rules) for this game and . . . um, it's not very good. I soloed a three-player game that went fairly well, but the two-player game I played against an opponent was a disaster: by the third turn, I was already running away with the game. Needless to say, my friend was not impressed. [2 plays; sold Jun'12]

Don't let all this talk about poor rules, lousy graphics, and run-away leader issues keep you from trying this excellent economic engine game.  After our first 5-player game, we all had a great time so we decided to play it again.  The two games played out very differently and suggest multiple paths to victory.  We did allow a run-away leader in the second game but that was due to the four of us being stupid not a fault of the game.  Print out all the player aids available and the FAQ and you will be fine.  The game isn't that hard to learn.  JKML has rules to their online version of the game.  I strongly urge you to read those rules first before playing the face-to-face version of the game.  Update:  I have played three 3-player games and really enjoyed them.  With some experience, we are finishing in just over an hour.  In one of the games, the winner actually had the least amount of production.

WOW. This might just be the worst game I have ever played.

It's an "economic" game with no economics. There aren't any trade-offs, because you simply don't have enough options for spending your money [literally; you need workers in order to make production engine choices, but only get them from something like 3 cards in the entire game; the only other thing to buy with money are the auctioned development cards, of which--with 2 players--a grand total of 2 are available every turn, which will be bid up such that one player gets one and the other player gets the other]. There is almost literally no opportunity cost because there is almost no opportunity in the game; you have one thing to spend money on, and you spend it.

Compare to The Scepter of Zavandor which a) Allows you to purchase outright the equivalent of Phoenicia's "workers", giving you an actual trade-off between bidding on cards and building up your engine; and b) Throws in the entirely separate skill track sub-game, which gives you a third main option for the use of your money, leading to a much richer opportunity cost analysis. Both are nearly identically the same system [pulled from Outpost], but the difference in the games [I still think Zavandor might as well be in the BGG top 100 or even top 10 given what the general BGG populace likes] is really quite remarkable. The games are so very very different.

Dear god this might be the most pointless game ever.

Two plays and I'm still trying to figure this game out.  The hopeless rules and confusing iconography dont seem to be able to fully hide the fact that there's a good game in there somewhere trying to get out.

What I can't see yet is if there are any clear strategies or if it's just the luck of the draw where you are in the biddingorder when certain cards come out, or if there's a run-away leader problem.

I suspect this rating will either go up or down by a couple of points depending on the next few plays but for now I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

This tends to be a perfect planning, perfect bidding auction game that I have to work at to do really well and we have a player in my game group that is just so very good at these type of games that it reduces the fun factor for me due to the extreme learning curve to this game.  This also makes it hard to play with new players.   Better for tight knit groups of serious, serious gamers (could upgrade with further play therefore).

Forgiving game of production and victory point development.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Each round, players bid on cards that give out production, VPs or a combination of both. Production gives more cards with a monetary value of 4, 5 or 6. This money is used for bidding and training workers. Workers are employed for hunting ,farming, etc. Workers are first trained for $2, then they can be employed. Depending on the location of employment, the start up cost for each worker is different, but the higher the start up cost, the higher the pay off in production and VPs. For instance, on a farm the cost for a worker is $5, yielding 2 production and 1 VP per worker. On a hunting ground, the cost is only $2, but the payoff is only 1 production and 1 VP per worker. 

This is a game with a fairly steep learning curve. It's an engaging game, but a couple things do bother me a bit. Your production cards range in value from 4-6, and it would be good to reduce the luck factor a bit. Also, auction cards come out in a staggered manner, but still there is luck in the order they come out. It's a decent game.

Utterly dull auction game that has far too many cards to decipher whats any good. 

Training workers just isn't worth it. Won the game by collecting cards that gave me discounts on other cards that won me the game. Strange bidding process where the leader bids first. Pretty much 90% of game board is pointless.

RATING: 6
An economic/auction game that for some reason doesn't press any of my buttons - the rulebook is among the worst I have come across, atrocious. The game is slightly dry (underlined by the bland and at times ugly graphic design) The deepest flaw is, however, the non-interesting auctions (lack tension) and a serious runaway leader problem.

RATING: 6
Tech-tree based games usually do not score high with me, and this was no exception. It definitely felt better than Master Leonardo, whose shared-invention subsystem I didn't like at all. Phoenicia provides players with clearer goals, by allowing them to acquire (by auction) cards that directs their directions of progress. However, I still don't like the fact that your options are just too obviously limited. In basic games, it is relatively easy to end up with redundant cash because you are allowed to get only one card by auction. This can feel a bit frustrating, because cash alone does not mean that you can do things you want to do(another resource, the workers, are highly limited). The redundant cash is then discarded, because you also need storage to keep them. Not very satisfactory feeling.

In the advanced game(of which I've only heard the explanation), you can burn the redundant cash by being able to buy more than one thing in the auction phase, but this is potentially leading to a serious case of runaway leader problem.

RATING: 7
I prefer this over Scepter of Zavandor just for the time savings alone (which weren't evident in our first game, but now that the rules have been grasped it should play in about 90 minutes - not the 60 minutes touted on the box!). The theme just makes more sense to me and I don't mind the simplification of the monetary system (I never had a problem with SoZ's heavy math, but most othrs do and that can really slow things down). The rapid end game acceleration turns me off a bit, but I don't see how you could avoid that, other than requring more victory points to win. I Look forward to the occasional play of this over the years.

OK, here's where a good theme makes or breaks a game -- this is essentially Scepter of Zavandor with a different theme and a slightly different engine.  I don't think the changes are for the better.  The auction mechanic is lopsided, the engine is obscenely lopsided (there are two paths to victory and if you're out of them you're busted), and "runaway leader" syndrome is here in spades.

More important, while Phoenicia is significantly shorter than SoZ, it's also much less fun, because the theme is played out for me.  I think I'm done with "The Occupation of City" games for a while.  Say what you will about Cheapass Games, at least they're looking for a theme beyond "working in a medieval city".  Scepter's schools of witchery is at least a new spin on an econ-engine game.

Resource management, auctions. You try to take control of buildings that will let you earn more money, or get more people. Increasing your income is important to try to stay ahead of alongside other players. Definitely requires multiple plays before you really get a feeling for what a good progression of buildings is.

It is a resource management game hiding in a civilization game's clothes. There is a well balanced tension between building better production capacity and scoring right away. The game seems to be working equally well with 3 and 5 players.

Played once with 5 players: after 2 turns, 2 players (including me) were obviously leaders with no way for the 3 others to catch up. I'll try this with fewer players and without the "one auction per turn". I really hope my rating will increase then!
EDIT: a better rating after a few plays. Still mixed about this game but much more pleasant with less players and more experience around the table.

An auction game with very tight money management, including a bit of engine building as well. Lacking in the fun department. The game is balanced only through knowing the right price for each building, and has a serious runaway leader problem. 

The cheap plastic components are a weird choice; Since they are just regular cubes, discs, and pawns, why can't they be wooden?

Pleasant but brutal auction/economic game. I have found that the more I play it the more I enjoy it, though the rule book is confusing/difficult to remember - which often puts me off playing it more frequently. 

This game is unforgiving, so you need to make sure you know what you are doing. If you don't, you may have lost the game early and not even know it.

Games should be better produced thesedays... Confusing rulebook.  Clunky rules.  Poorly designed board, poorly designed cards (huge pointless picture and tiny important text).

Lighter civ building card game with auctions and a Euro-ish feel. Games play about 15 to 25 minutes per player. For our situation, this is primarily played as a fine 2 player.

This grows on you, but to some players the mechanisms will be too fiddly. Perhaps a runaway leader problem.

The rulebook and graphics need a rethinking for this solid game.

RATING: 8
What I like:
- Nice civ theme
- Seems to play pretty quickly (the snowball effect is big)
- Several mechanisms seem quite clever
- Once you understand the game, it is pretty smooth and straightforward
- Multiple paths to victory--seems really well balanced
- 4p with 3 first-timers finished in 90 minutes; 2p with 1 first-timer took 60

What I don't like:
- The ridiculously large box
- Tracking production/VP feels quite awkward at first
- The cardcoin conversions and storage limits are a bit convoluted
- I hope the auctions don't have to be as cutthroat as I have read
- The rules are not great, and even the Nova rules are a bit rough in spots
- Setup with different player counts is non-trivial
- 2p and 3p games leave out advanced hunting, advanced mining, and improved VP purchase
- Components usually aren't critical to me, but the graphic design is terrible, and the plastic pieces feel out of place.

This is my first real economic snowball game, and I quite like it. Although it is confusing at first, there really is a straightforward game here. There are multiple paths to victory. The icons are not great, but are OK once you understand them.

For $10 that this game is going for used, it's a super bargain!

I would put the weight around 2.5, quite a bit lower than the BGG-voted 2.9.

Interesting idea from a designer I like a great deal.  Doesn't seem to deliver, though, since the game seems to have a "runaway leader" problem.  Once you get someone out in front, it can be very hard to catch them.  Falling behind earlier also seems to be devastating with little chance to recover.

Not sure if this is a structural issue with the game or a lack of understanding on the part of the group I'm gaming with, but the balance somehow just seems to be out of whack making the game non-competitive for some very, very early.

After a few plays, I'm starting to figure out how to win at this game.  This game is really hard on new players for a number of reasons.  The building-worker system affecting your points and income works well, but it's not intuitive.  There's strategies that work well together, but what they are isn't immediately obvious.  And once a player gets a significant lead, he'll usually snowball his way to victory.  It may be more competitive between skilled players, but this doesn't get to the table enough to get to that point.

Auction-driven economic engine game set in an ancient city-state. Players bid for semi-randomly ordered industries and urban advances, then employ workers to gain VPs and income. Plays pretty quickly 2P, and certainly would reward repeat plays. I didn't find the rules nearly as bad as reported, but the rewrite is definitely an improvement. I was hoping for something a bit more thematic than what this offers, and traded it.

RATING: 7
Good game, but in my one play I encountered 2 problems: long gaming time (start the gaming event with this game, don't end with it) and mattheus-effect: the richer get richer, the poorer are lucky if they can get a lesser card;

Second play: The problems in the first game, weren't there anymore: not a runaway-leader - problem anymore and I found it estonishing that one player only had an income of 3 cards the hole time, but still was second. Therefore upgraded my rating (6.5 -> 7).

RATING: 6
There are a few design elements I like about Phoenicia: 
First off there is a scoring track with a target vp, so already there is a visual racing commentary to provide tension (though there is no final reveal, as vps are known). 

Interestingly, as with Railroad Tycoon, the scoring track also doubles up as an income track and the really clever thing here is the income is paid out in face down cards which vary in value from 4 to 6. This unknown variance introduces an uncertainty as to how much a player probably holds (like in Lost Valley), adding angst in start bids and a stronger bluffing element in the auctions.
 
As well as income cards there are coins, which brings me to the other aspect I like: there are limits to how much income you can receive, imposed by storage. You need to bid for such improvements (which come out in semi-scripted fashion) as well as for improvements in victory points and production of income, so the game is an interesting source of problems to solve via auctions and resource management.

One last feature I like is that the board also indicates the connection between improvements (which bestows discounts in auctions), but more importantly also indicates the distribution of these improvements amongst a number of players. I find alot of games using cards/tiles breakdown for me when there is no memorable means of what has gone and what is left in the deck/bag (Ra is an example of such a diverse and confusing manifest). 

Despite the board and markers indicating ownership of cards purchased as well as what is left in the deck, at 19 different cards in various quantities is starting to tax me. Coupled with the fact that Phoenicia is a cost effective exercise of finding one of the best productive avenues to victory means too much "left brain" calculating of anticipated variables. Maybe with 2 players this wouldn't be such a problem, but then you would only be using a third of the development deck, and miss out on some of the improvements.
 
Though not as fiddly to book-keep and well-themed, (except why auctions when trading makes more sense in those times) I'd be happy to play it occasionally in a game group, but it wouldn't be a game to keep for the family.

This is a watered down version of The Scepter of Zavandor. Similar problems of run away leader and being unforgiving especially in the first few turns, do exist, but to a lesser degree. I do not like Zavandor, but I can tolerate this one, and besides, this one is a lot shorter.

Wow...this game is addictive. Within a week of purchasing it I played it 6 times. It's tempting to bid on the juicy developments at auction, even when you should be upgrading what you already have. There's tension in the bidding, where you try to drive up the price for other players without getting stuck with something you don't want. Since items can be vastly different in value for different players, you sometimes have to bid on something you don't want or another player will get too good of a deal. But what if they know you don't need it and stick you with it? And all in 45-90 mins! Another great game, Mr. Lehmann.

Edit: I have drastically dropped my rating of this game as I have come to the conclusion that it suffers a runaway leader (or fallaway trailer) problem and that it is strictly inferior to Scepter of Zavandor.

A wonderful auction-based light civilization games. The rules are lousy, and the components leave something to be desired, but underneath the gameplay is fantastic. Plays fast, has lots of strategic decisions, and works with 2-5 players. Reminds me a bit like Power Grid or Goa.

Edit: It's a much quicker game with 2 players, and with experienced played it's quite competitive. Not as good a 2 player auction game as Goa, but still fun.

I do prefer RA over Phoenicia. I found the game a bit too fiddly and the theme way too inconsistent, the player interaction is not as tight as in other auction games I have player. Furthermore, the advantage of the leading player(s) is heavily unbalanced and however goes first controls the auction, has the most money and so forth. Also, I found the game tends to become interesting only in the last two rounds. I would play it again, but it is just more of the same with a weak theme and not enough polish.

RATING: 9
After playing with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players, I've decided that I really like Phoenicia.

The rulebook is below average, the scoring track too small (as well as having a "valley" where the board folds), and the graphic design work on the development cards is nothing short of abysmal (white houses on a light grey background, tiny text and a huge - and irrelevant - illustration are my main gripes with the cards).  Fortunately the game itself is really good.  

There are multiple routes to victory, several of them having noticeably different "speeds" so that a early points lead may - or may not - be an indicator of the eventual winner.

The game takes about 90 minutes - no longer unless you play slowly - and packs plenty into that time.  The best part is that you clearly need to have some sort of plan in mind, but you cannot stick slavishly to it.  If you take your eye off the opponents, you may find that they have foiled your plans while sneaking a win themselves.

A decent civ building game with a lot of paths to victory.  However, the game seems to move too quickly for many of the potential paths to pan out.

A bit susceptible to runaway leaders.

One of the most underrated in games in BGG. Adjusting to your situation is the key in this game. You can never play exactly the same way since the building order in each era is different. 4, 5, and 6 value production card system is very innovative. You have to always evalute your position against other players. You should know when to save your money for the next round. You can't overbid early on or buy something that doesn't fit your strategy. Sometimes it's just crucial to overbid for a card if you are in the lead and want to deny a card from your rivals. Probably one of the best player scalability in an auction game in the market. 2-player game is ultra tense and you can't spent your money unwisely. 4-player probably the best and the most balanced. In a 5-player game you have to know how much is your maximum bid since the price can change a lot. I am yet to see a game where anybody hasn't made crucial mistakes that have cost him the game. I'm still waiting to see the full tension that this game offers when players grasp every aspect of this game.

Final edit: It was my first boardgame and very enjoyable one but I sold it away since felt I had already enough enjoyment out of it and felt the game doesn't give you that many new challenges in the long run. It's also a bit hard for new players. I just felt it was time to move on and sell Phoenicia away.

I had an uncanny sense as I read the rules of this game and I realise it was because I had played it as a prototype without any of the theme. Unfortunately the things I thought were wrong with the prototype are still wrong with the game as it stands, namely that the guillotine used to end it produces such a sharp short endgame it rather disrupts the flow of things. Its okay apart from that (though the card/money business still looks clumsy).

I have only played this once to date, back in 2013, and I doubt I'll play often if indeed ever again - but I was quite impressed with the game, a civilisation-management game heavily based on auctions, but with a very wide range of different benefits available from the auctioned items. The way your "money" is handled - you get counters worth 1 each, and randomly drawn cards worth either 4, 5 or 6, with the game imposing limits on both the number of cards and the number of counters you can hold - seemed original to me and led to interesting decisions. I don't see this game as a classic, but I found it an intriguing game and lighter than I was expecting.

Definite runaway leader problem which might be ameliorated by insisting on a limit of one auction win per turn.  The downside will probably be a significant increase in play time.  We'll certainly want to find out.

UPDATE: After trying with the rule that only one item may be won by a player each turn, we found that the runaway leader problem was significantly reduced, and without a tremendous increase in play time.  Still, all at the table agreed that a bit of the excitement was also gone.  Coming up with a game in the vein of Das Zepter von Zavandor or Outpost that plays in a little over an hour is a worthy goal, and this one counts as a near miss.

UPDATE: After more play, I've upgraded to 7.  The short playing time and fun, snappy pace of the game make it nice in the hour or less time slot.  We'll work on trying to implement something to rein in leaders without making the game run too long.

--Aug2007-- Much faster to play than I'd expected, given the Outpost lineage.  I found the game quite delightful, and my 7 year old thought it was good fun too.
--Feb2012-- After a four-ish year interregnum, I've come back to the game - and found it dramatically better than I remember.  I think I'll hang on to it for a while.

I'm not really impressed.  I appreciate the economic structure of this game, but it seems to me that they are not quite balanced correctly.  Our game came down to victory based on ponts off of auction wins and not so much off production.  The production seems to be less than ground breaking and often I saw no meaningful spread between the high production and players that had little production (in only the last turn was the lowest player not collecting .  As a artist, I found this game to be woefully lacking in graphic design.  The board is nothing more than a score track and a large player aid.  Art on the cards is of the psuedo computer generated variety and the special abilities that the card offer are terribly hard to read.  

I'd try this one again, but I suspect my opinion will not change much.

An interesting 'build your engine to get money and victor points' type of game. Each round the same number of cards as there are players are auctioned off and the cards give you different amount of VPs, production points and/or discounts towards other cards. It's apparent there are several strategies to try and to be able to fully appreciate you should be familiar with the cards. It has a 'programmed' feel to it but I'll gladly play it again.

OK. So couple of things about that game:
- I scored it as medium heavy, because if you want to win it is a quite heavy game;
- it's unforgiving game, especially if you do something stupid in the beginning you won't win in the most cases...
- it iraiteated me, because I feel it has some depth, and reading here on BGG some posts I can see that it has many layers... 

At least: I want to play it again. But not too soon.

A fairly quick-playing bidding / upgrading-collecting / lightweight-engine-building game which works quite well for two players.

Phoenicia réimplante les mécanismes du très sympathique [gameid=13884] sorti il y a quelques années chez Lookout Games. On a affaire à deux jeux de gestion à la progression « géométrique » : on investit pour gagner plus, et on réinvestit l'argent ainsi gagné… Le défaut de cette approche est clair : un mauvais début de partie est très difficile, voire impossible à rattraper. Mais par rapport à [gameid=13884], l'équilibre est ici bien mieux réussi. D'une part, le jeu est moins long, il est donc moins frustrant quand on est à la traine. Si un joueur a vraiment pris une avance importante, c'est qu'on est à deux ou trois tours de la fin. D'autre part, il faut ici investir sur deux plans : les revenus, qui se réinvestissent, et les points de victoire, véritable objectif du jeu. Un retard pris en PV est tout aussi difficile à rattraper qu'un retard sur les revenus !

Au final, on obtient un jeu parfaitement équilibré et particulièrement tendu : plusieurs voies stratégiques paraissent envisageables (miser sur les ouvriers ou au contraire les cartes offrant des revenus), et les enchères, véritable point noir de [gameid=13884] où la tension était absolument inexistante, sont ici au centre du jeu, au point de me rappeler le mécanisme du marché des centrales de [gameid=2651] ou les enchères aux [gameid=555].

Reste une édition passablement ratée : les pions en plastique sont d'assez mauvais gout, il y a plusieurs erreurs d'impression, les symboles sont illisibles, la règle confuse et parfois incomplète. Tout est ici fait pour simplifier la vie des joueurs maitrisant déjà bien le jeu, et les premières parties sont alors particulièrement éprouvantes : les aides de jeu prêtent facilement à confusion.

Tout cela s'efface heureusement bien vite devant l'admirable équilibre, la réelle richesse stratégique et la tension du jeu.

It isn't my only criteria by many means - indeed I live lots of games that I suck at (eg Powergrid and Steel Driver) - but I find it hard to resist the charm of a game that I won first time. Go me. Auction / Civ building / Worker-placement - a nice balance of all three for a quick game, which has the merit of giving room for a runaway leader - god knows, if every frikkin game you play has 5 points between first and last place, it gets a bit tiresome after a while. Wooden pieces would be preferred, but the White plastic almost seems a bold and outrageous attack on convention.

A fine auction technology advancement game. Clever auction decisions to be made in what is quite a simple game. Plays well with five. For those who like auction games this should appeal. The theme is rather thin, but fits never-the-less. Enjoyable without being brain burning in either rules or decisions.

RATING: 8
A civilization game that has an epic taste and can be easily played in an hour and a half, based on an auction mechanic and resource management, specially of laboral force.  It is unforgiving and has a clear snow ball issue, so players that aren't able to catch the wave for the final run in the first half (or even in the first turns) are going to be lost all game with no chance, but for those wise enough to survive and have a shot at the end it is very tense, exciting and fun.  In the long term, it may have replayability problems, since players may want to get always the same cards, but meanwhile it isn't proved for sure with more plays, so far so good.

Elegant economic game with a decent range of options.  The two aspects I most disliked (the semi-random card draw and the building auctions) are the core of the game but what wins me over is that the game is clearly short enough that this is never a real problem - if you fall behind in, say, Zeptre von Zarandor, then you have to sit around for two hours waiting to lose whereas in this when you find yourself in a losing position it will be over pretty soon.
(2010: Down a point because the skill imbalance is horrific and sometimes it drags.)

This is a decent game, once you get past the poor graphic design and see what's actually going on. I hope someone prints a 2nd edition of this with better graphics - most of the board is useless, and the part that is useful (the production/score track) is very small for holding up to 10 tokens. The reference info from one card to another isn't very good, and the fact that the card is named differently from the tile it gives you is also unnecessary. The game itself isn't bad though.

There are quite a few interesting things going on in Phoenicia.  The auctions, for the most part, are interesting.  The production of money and VP's is interesting.  The double track I think it a really near thing.  There are a lot of things there that should really make this a game I enjoy (and want to buy for my own).  Unfortunately, the game just doesn't grab me. 

Normally, theme isn't something  that is particularly necessary for me to enjoy a game.  For example, I love Atlantic Star despite the silly, essentially non-existent theme.  However, in Phoenicia, the theme is essentially non-existent and a game I should like doesn't grab me.  For the first time I can recall, I was thinking about the "soulless Euro cube pusher" descriptor when playing.  I wish that weren't so.  [07/07/2012]

Phoenicia -- Played four- and five-player.  Inspired by Outpost, but shorter than Scepter von Zavandor (also Outpost-inspired).  The issue I see with this game isn't Runaway Leader so much as Snowball Effect.  Card distribution seems unbalanced.  Also I have issues with the implementation -- the victory point symbols (circular) and production symbols (amphoras) are counterintuitive when compared with the coin tokens (circular).  It's not just a thoughtless oversight, it makes play downright counterintuitive.

RATING: 4
Simplified Outpost (or Zepter von Zavandor more recently) is still a game with a runaway leader problem that can only be somewhat mitigated by defensive bidding - if everyone is very vigilant and aggressive enough this is not a problem because you will force the leader to pay more when you can. The rulebook, graphics and production design are also hideous - especially in comparison to the gorgeous production quality of Lookout Games' Zepter (hardly fair to compare TimJim's oldschool spartan Outpost - although even that was easier to understand than Phoenicia). The bottom line is that the game is only marginally fun with all the calculations and discounts. It's the only one of the three I'd be willing to play again because sitting around for hours waiting for the leader to win ain't much fun. I've owned all three and gotten rid of each one (well, Phoenicia is on the trade list).

A decent, medium-weight auction game that is slightly flawed by somewhat unbalanced cards and an unnecessarily fiddly monetary system. The setup is a little annoying too. Still, the game gets better after everyone has had a game or two under their belts. A fair alternative to games like New England and Princes of Florence. It's a bit better than the former, and lighter and quicker than the latter.

Outpost III: Son of SoZ!

So I have Scepter of Zavandor and while I like it, it doesn't get much play.  I was a bit skeptical about this when it first came out, but after playing it I see just how great this system is.  Certainly like the first two versions there is a bit of a break away leader problem, but the game is quick enough that by the time it is a problem the game is over.  It is a constant struggle to keep up and to manage all of your workers and upgrades.  It just is swell!  I like games where you are building an economic machine and I am a sucker for tech trees.  This game is all about both.  It has a nice flavor and it is surprisingly engaging for the how notably abridged this version is of the original system.

Certainly this won't be for everyone, but those that like heavier Euros will probably dig this.

UPDATE:  I played this with 4 and within the first couple turns it was abundantly obvious that those in first would remain in first and those in last would flounder until the end.  I will never play this again with any number other than three.  I'd rate it a 3 with four players.

UPDATE: I Played this with 5 and it was a solid game.  I fear that this is one of those games where if it works it is great and if it doesn't it is a disaster.

Have only played once, but didn't much care for it. I liked how money and victory points worked, but didn't like the actual markers used for them; they definitely could have been differentiated more clearly. I also thought the coin/card money system was a little convoluted for what it achieved. The end of the game seems a foregone conclusion long before the actual end because of what seems to be a runaway leader issue (I only played once so I could be wrong). Also, the actual font on the cards was crazy small! I would estimate that it was about 4 point so everyone had to pick the cards up the examine them. Lastly, some call this a civ-light game??? Because I won the auction for the Dye Factory? No real theme to speak of. A lot of effort towards graphic design, the money system, and runaway leader issue could go a long way towards making this a good solid game.

RATING: 7.5
A rethemed, streamlined, simplified version of Outpost/Scepter of Zavandor. Instead of magical apprentices, you're city builders. The knowledge tracks and artifacts have been merged into a deck of development cards for city improvements or technologies. Income generation is simplified: Instead of 5 types of currency you have only 2 (cards worth mostly 5 [some 4s, some 6s] and coins worth 1). Most development cards increase your "production" which generates increasing amounts of currency (cards/coins) following a simple pattern shown on the score track. Perhaps most importantly, when you spend money you DO get change -- so you no longer need to spend time calculating all the permutations of your various forms of money to figure out how much to bid on things!

I prefer the theme of Zavandor. Also, production is subpar: the board needs to be redesigned (score track spaces too small), cards/tiles need some updating (a few icons/graphics are off), and the rules need a major overhaul. In game play, most games have seemed to suffer from a rich-get-richer problem: the early leader won the game. It might be because of inexperience (newbies in all my games so far) or the introductory rules (limit auction wins to 1 item/player/round), or a lack of built-in limits? Zavandor (artificially) penalizes the leader and helps the stragglers by modifying item costs -- this game doesn't have anything like that. However, the game moved along very smoothly and quickly so I'd certainly play it again. I'm just not sure I need to own it quite yet.

I'm writing after seven 2-player games; still haven't managed to get more people to the table. This is a brutal two player game - if you don't enjoy smashing one another's hopes and dreams, choose something else. The competition is brutal in Phoenicia.

The game consists of a series of auctions for cards to add to your tech tree. Sounds innocent enough, right? It isn't. Every card has value, but (with two players) there are no duplicates. Every card that goes to your opponent is an opportunity lost. You can crush your opponent by monopolizing production. Or if he does get production, you can insure that most of it will be wasted if you can deny him sufficient storehouses.

The game presents a continuous stream of subtle decisions, with consequences larger than they initially appear. The rules are a bit tough to assimilate initially, but it's worth the trouble. I hope to play eventually with a larger group, but even if I never play with more than two, Phoenicia has exceeded my expectations.

Update: I did eventually get in a three player game, and it worked quite well.

After 20+ plays, I'm downgrading this from a 6 to a 5.  A series of early 4s will invariable lead to loss (low likelihood event).  The game shines because of its balance between length and depth.  Sure it's not as deep as Das Zepter or Outpost,  but it plays in 1/4th the time.  This huge compression in time makes for a truly fun gaming experience.

Plays much faster than Outpost and Zepter of Zavandor, but still doesn't cut it for me. With this game the auctions are even more important than in its two predecessors and it is the auction part that I like the least in this kind of games.
Not enough time to really form and implement a strategy. Winning the right auctions at the right time is far more important.

Phoenicia is not a bad game but boy it can be hard to figure out at times.  The game plays really quite well once you get past that obstacle.  What is crucial is making sure that your production/victory point count matches the cards and workers you have employed.  The difficulty lies more in the fact that sometimes "advancing" a worker physically may not necessarily change your score or production, though the next worker you add in that job will.  Even with these initial hiccups, my wife still is interested in the game which I think reveals it has many future plays.

I played this one a couple weeks ago at my cousins.  I enjoyed it, which is surprising...I browse BGG quite often, yet never heard of Phoenicia.  I figured it was a not so great game, considering it's not even near the top.  But, I think I've come to realize the ratings don't mean a lot.  My favorite games are often not in the top 10 (or even top 50).

While I enjoyed this game in my first play, I do feel there could be more to it.  I soon realized there are other (more in depth) variants out there (Outpost, which is OOP, unfortunately, and The Scepter of Zavandor).

After my one play of Phoenicia, I ordered it for myself, but also ordered Zavandor (which I think I'll enjoy more...).  Phoenicia will be reserved for the less gamer gamers.

Well, it's a design mess; the card iconography and the on-board info display are not helpful or useful, and the development cards are only half-thought-through.  It seems as if there is not only no way to catch a run-away, there is not even a way to keep pace.  It is satisfying to see how the development cards run out right when you should be hitting 32 pts anyway, but that's pretty much it for satisfaction.

RATING: 6
A development game where you accumulate cash and try to outbid other players to get improvements to get more cash or victory points. The "build-tree" seems a bit odd since you can build anything you want, but having buildings earlier in the tree gives you a discount. Didn't find that it stopped other players from outbidding you though. Citizens turned out to be a precious commodity as the ONLY way you can get more is to bid on special cards that add them in, unlike say Gold which you earn every turn. Without citizens, you can't man your improvements. In the end, the players with the most free citizens had the greatest flexibility to maximise points for the win.

I bought this because I like Zepter and was hoping that this would be a little bit of different flavor. Unfortunately I really have problems with the auctions placing limitations on acquiring parts (workers, storehouses) for your economic engine. I like the aspect of the game where you buy a tech that gives you a new board and upgrading workers to more efficient roles, but I like Through the Ages more and can get this aspect there. So it seems Through the Ages and Zepter have made the issues I have with this game a lot bigger deal.

RATING: 8
I think this rating may go up after I get to play it a few more times.  This is like a super-stripped down version of Through The Ages.  I actually won our first time playing with a straightforward mining strategy, but only because I think the other players made a mistake letting me buy 2 City Walls.  (You can do that, right?  I couldn't find anything that said you couldn't...)  In retrospect, it seemed to me that the only strategy that should really stand a chance of winning is an all-out clothmaking strategy, but I suppose if everyone knows/thinks that, the auctions will make it so expensive that the other strategies might stand a chance.  As I said, I clearly need to play it some more to find out.  The rules are a little loose in spots, but I don't think anything critical was missing.

RATING: 5
The actual game is better than my ranking would indicate, but getting into the game is a chore. There are multiple production flaws, and each compounds the others. First, the rules are not clearly written or presented. Far worse, the graphic design is about as bad as it gets. Symbols and text on the cards are tiny and poorly presented (and ugly, to boot). Add to that that the game is a bit fiddly (requiring constant recalculation of production and victory point totals as workers move between areas), a bit long for what it is and prone to seeing some runaway leaders emerge, and the good basic game concept is very much buried by this series of defects. The game is hard to grasp not because it is difficult, but because of poorly written rules; the confusion gets magnified by nonintuitive and hard-to-read graphics; the angst mounts as players constantly need to re-check points and production; and the frustration drags on because the game is just a bit too long (and some players likely to be hopelessly out of contention, just playing out the string). Call it a near miss, because there are some interesting mechanics here.

RATING: 7
Played twice with 3 players. The first game was quite difficult to play as there are so many paths to victory and if you don't know what kind of cards come up for auction, you don't know how to bid at all. There is a fine balance between advancing in the "pots" path quickly or saving up a bit of money to make sure one has enough money to bid to prevent somebody from getting a valuable card for cheap. Nice components, except the common victory/pots path is way too confusing for new players as well. With even mildly experienced players, this plays quite quickly.

Interesting Civilization type game.  The depth is evident after one play so many thoughts of what I could've done differently.  Really hope that I can get some extra opponents interested in the game.  Two players is fun, but I want to play with more than one copy of each development.  
After two plays, I've really enjoyed it.  Me and my wife practically switched every development from first to second game.

I really like the multiplayer game, though it requires a certain balance between the players to be best.  Definitely a game I look forward to playing many more times.

I've played this a few times with my family.  They may be the only people I ever play it with :).  This is by far the heaviest game my mom is interested in playing, and it's lots of fun with 4.  Little ones make it tough to play as often as I'd like, but hopefully it'll get easier to pull it out moving forward.

My first opinion was that this is an interesting civilization building game that is very much subject to runaway leader issues.  On further reflection, it is really more of the same old tech tree/civ building exercise with not much new to recommend it.  I'm not in any rush to play again, but wouldn't mind trying it again to see if more plays will help me appreciate it more.

Had been wanting to play this for awhile now and felt it a little lack luster. I'm not fond of it just ending without any "end game scoring" just seems to not award the work you did manage. There so much opportunity to have unspent money seems like it should be good for something. What about workers? I bought them, or even trained them shouldn't that be worth something...I'm working on a end game variant that may help it out some too.

Phoenicia was a surprise hit for me; I wasn't expecting much looking at the artwork and fairly dull theme, but the game grabbed me after only a few moments. The building mechanic is one that I really enjoy, and I can't believe that the game feels so "meaty", yet takes only a short amount of time. It plays well with two players (something many multiplayer games - especially auction games - don't), and every game can play out differently based on the randomness of when buildings show up for auction. I highly recommend the game -- just get someone to teach you if possible.  See my review for more details...

This is quickly becoming my wife's game of choice to play. She can't remember the name so she calls it, "The game that I get frustrated with." Even so, she loves the challenge and it is her first pick to play.

********************
Played a couple more two player games. There is definitely a path or two to victory with two players. However, it isn't set in stone of "if I do this then I automatically win". There's a good balance to this game that has almost surgical precision.

********************
Only played twice. But here's the best compliment that I can give the game. My wife hates it, she says she isn't going to play it again, and yet if I ask about playing it there is an internal struggle that finally leads to her being pulled back to the table.

Yes, there is a runaway leader issue that can only be curtailed by strategic play. You can't let people get two trackers and then not expect to have them hunt you out of existence. However, two trackers won't kill you if they don't have storage to keep the cards they draw. Ah, the intricacies of this game.

1.5 plays.  First game we got the rules so wrong, we had to start over.  The second try I think we nearly got it right.  It really seems like once there's a leader in the game, it's very difficult to catch up.  This game feels like one that you have to play quite a few times to be competitive, which is fine.  I can't figure out the different paths to victory, nor can I see how to block or even slow down the leader, who already gets an advantage by going first each turn.  And the rich get richer.  I would try it again, but there are so many other games that exercise the same muscles, it's hard to justify giving this game the attention it requires to get up to speed.

I've logged one play. That's technically a lie...
We tried. We opened the box and spent about an hour trying to parse the rules. By the time we'd figured out set up and what the rules were referring to, as far as what all the bits were called and the parts of the board it was naming, we were so fed up we put it back in the box.
i.e. this could be a great game, but it's not great enough to overcome it's terrible rules booklet. It didn't look interesting enough to overcome our frustration. And we've muddled through some pretty terrible games before.

RATING: 6.5
My rating for this game started at 5.0, went up to 7.5, and finally settled at 6.5

We had spent multiple hours trying to understand the rules, and we still played it incorrectly.  We wasted a lot of time playing what seemed like a terribly broken game. Thus my 5.0 rating.

The second time that we played, we had a blast.  It played quickly enough that we played twice in a row. It took me another play or two to find it's fatal flaw.

After a few more plays, I came to the realization that the Dye House is just too powerful.  It comes up early and is expensive, so I used to think this was balancing.  But, now my strategy is just to have as much money as possible when the first Dye House comes out.  If you get the first one, then you have a decent chance to get the second. If you get both, then the game is practically unwinnable for all other players.

At least the game does play fast.  This is why I'm not lowering the rating down below 6.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
A bad game, too few and obvious paths and you need to pursue one specific or lose. The auction is the only thing balancing this but the game won't last until you learn this game good enough to know how much and when to bid, that is the relative value of things. And in any case, a game relying on auction as the only balancing factor is pure crap. Luckily Tom Lehmann didn't give up after this game and went on to produce some good games instead.

Dry as a desert and features such innovative mechanics as (ooh!) auctions and (aah!) production engines.  Despite such seen-it-all-before gameplay, I still like it.  The tradeoffs of storage, discounts, workers, and production make for some satisfying decisions.  You know your decisions will come back to help or hurt you in the later game.  And, deliciously, sometimes the best option is to pass in the bidding and just build up your economy.  The biggest problem is that this game does have a runaway leader issue, though it ends surprisingly quickly after that leader is identified.  Be aware, though, the components have poor functionality design.  It's worth playing a solo game so you know how everything works before trying to teach this one.

RATING: 7
Fairly simple civilization/auction game, where players bid on tiles and add them to their little civ. Tiles give you better income, points for end game, extra workers which you can use to man tiles, or new abilities such as discounts on future tile purchases. Has a very interesting economy, where you get paid in cards which show 4,5, or 6 coins, and discs representing 1 coin. Your purchased tiles determine how many cards you're allowed to keep, so you need to manage your city well to increase your money flow, so as to purchase better tiles down the road. But you also need workers to put on those tiles, and extra workers are rare.

I guess this is where I insult half of BGG, as I really don't understand why most folks seem to think the rules are so bad. They're straightforward, well laid out, and have lots of examples to clarify any questions. There's one unfortunate typo of "more than four" instead of "four or more", when converting 4 discs into money cards, but that's easy to spot the moment you get exactly four and say "surely, if 4 converts to a card, and I have 4, I can convert."

Decent game that works OK with 2 players, but I really want to try it with more.

RATING: 8
(After 1 5p game)  My eyes glossed over a bit as the rules and economics were described.  Once I got a turn or two under my belt I felt like I "got it" and my decision making improved - enough to where I stumbled to victory.  I can see multiple paths to victory with this one and look forward future plays.   I dislike St Petersburg, but I enjoy this one.  Maybe because all players were learning the game at the same time and the "formula" for victory is unknown.

It really does have poor rules and graphic design.  Not insurmountable, but a PITA.

Game is an "engine" game: income creates points, and efficiency is key. It feels weird and different for this kind of game, though, much less straightforward in terms of accountancy than, say, St. Petersburg. Not sure I like having to play defense in the auctions all that much, though. Very concerned about long-term replay value, as it feels a bit confined in terms of variation from game to game as well as just providing different options to explore given the limited set of cards and buildings. Why not have a larger set of cards/effects and only use a subset?  Lehmann's designs--other than Race--always feel polished, but they don't let you deviate from the script too far, which is too bad.

Played a first game on JKLM...wow,  it goes fast!  Lots of dimensions to fiddle with - you need to generate money, but also need to store it. Playing the game online is ultra-easy,  although fear drove me to read the rulebook (and the rulebook rewrite) beforehand.Interesting...the production happens each turn,  but VPs are only scored once.  Too many comparisons with St. Pete made me expect that there was some rolling VP generation,  but I think I like this better - you trade off money production with static VP accumulation.I've both done very well and very poorly...without much of an idea as to what the critical point is.  All sorts of different setups,  very dependent on the order things come up.  Must resist urge to auction...Not a big fan of the graphics.   There's some ambiguous uses of coins vs production,  and the overlapping VP/production track really is a pain.Theme is growing on me,  but doesn't seem completely realised.  Uh...."VP Purchase Tile"?  Well,  yes, that's what it is,  but it could have been called...monuments or somesuch.Had it go over like a lead balloon yesterday - this is probably a tough game for people unwilling to shift gears when the bidding gets nasty.  Storage denial isn't much fun (although the player that was suffering that didn't bid hard for the cards with storage - it's tough to go for something suboptimal, but if you're at the back...),  and having a discount go to waste is also rough.

Really good game.  The rules really aren't as bad as complained about.  I personally would not have released them in the state they are in, but I was able to figure out the game in one reading of the rules.  Much, much more streamlined than ZvZ.  Thank god that the monetary calculations are gone. 

A bit too much rich get richer than I'd like, but still an enjoyable game.

I think I get it, but I'm not sure I'd really like it. It seems tough to catch someone who gets ahead, and if another player does take them down (by saving up and outbidding them on something), they leave themselves open to the other players. This might have been because we didn't get up on the production track fast enough, but both games that were completed (the first I didn't play) were basically won in the first few rounds. Maybe a greater understanding of the strategy would alleviate this? I've never played any other bidding games, so maybe I've missed something, but the other players were all pretty experienced and noted the same thing. Will have to give it another go.

Think I've played 3-4 games now and it's not *that* well received with my group. I'm disapponted cause I'm still getting to grips with what I need to do to win (generally).I think I have got that far now, but it feels like a tricky game to actually pull people back. On the other hand, if people are allowed cards at minimum price, it also helps them get ahead....

I hate the fact that you have to count your production output and victory points after every single turn, it makes the game SO SLOW!  Not to mention the fact that both of them are on the same track, often confusing people as to which piece we should be moving and which one denotes the amount of cards/coins we're suppose to get.  Bidding mechanic is over-simplified and under-utilized.  Too many abuse of the fact that you can trade in 4 coins for a card, and the game devolves into who can hoard the most points in hands to spend on big victory point items.  Good production value though.

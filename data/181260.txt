Clearly a game designed by those who love and admire Euro games - but without the polish. The graphical design is a mess which does not help matters. The system of stacking cubes and roofs is certainly fetching, but the rest of the game is a large homage to Feld games and yet without understanding *why* such mechanics are placed in a game. Some of the roof card rewards seemed to countermand the very fabric of the game: there's a place where breaking rules just makes the game silly. Burano is a golem of a Feld game - clumsier and faintly reminiscent, but not really alive.

Long and intricate.  I'm not sure all of the mechanics work well together.  A strange pseudo-worker placement wheel mechanism that I never quite figured out.  Building a pastel pyramid action tower was a cool idea and looked neat.  Not sure this is my thing, though.

RATING: 5
Wonderfully frustrating choices to have to make! Gorgeous components and clever (if occasionally arcane) mechanics make this a Euro delight. Sure wish you could roof the third level, though--if only for aesthetic reasons.

Got rid of this one because, despite its beauty and interesting decisions & mechanics, it was ultimately unsatisfying to play. Turns bogged down and the rather clunky two-step process of "staging" and then "building" cubes was a frustration. This clunkiness also kept the theme from coming through as well as it might have and we gave it a pass.

Massive first step to understand the rules and the implications of the various moves. Fishing option seems less punishing than the Lace making where losing cubes is a very tough trade off for a few points. The buildings which reward coloured roofs is a lottery for big points or none at all dependent upon the random draw for these tiles. I'm disappointed by such a random factor that can make such a big difference to end game points. I'm not convinced a second play would change my mind. Reflection makes me really uncomfortable with the randomness. Sold.

A fairly solid and rather heavy euro which is partially marred by a badly-written rulebook and also, in my case, by production issues that led to some damaged components. Gameplay-wise: very tight game that's also a bit of a point salad, and it looks beautiful.

Initial Impressions:
--------------------------
Overall an interesting game that probably could of used a little more work.  The game is a little "clunky", as well some aspects of the game seem more powerful than others.  I do think the game gets your brain hurting in a good way though, and I did enjoy playing the game for sure (just wish it was a little more streamlined).  2 players was fine, but I expect the game would be better at 3 or 4 players since it seemed a little too wide open with 2 players.

Seems like some good ideas, but definitely not convinced that the various options are relatively balanced with one another.  Some buildings seem especially better than others, and those that grant point bonuses for building with particular cubes are overpowered (compared with other bonuses).  

As I said, some decent ideas, but needed more development and play-testing.

RATING: 5
Better to copy from a master than to invent yourself. This game owes a lot of its mechanisms and overall feel to the oeuvre of Stefan Feld. That needn't be a Bad Thing, but in my opinion Burano's authors inserted too much Bora Bora or Aquasphere-feeling into their game: a hodgepodge of constructed mechanisms hammered until malleable, and then riveted together to form an undeniably cohesive, but still butt-ugly whole. However, even copying over mechanisms takes some skill, and that these first time (?) authors managed to deliver what they did is an encouraging thought.

The main issues I have with Burano is that the game suffers from cumbersome action multiplexing (meaning that there is too much hinging on individual actions leading to lack of control), that randomness has a big say in how actions are distributed over the six colours at the start of every new season (meaning that colour management is pretty pointless), that the touted action pyramid doesn't amount to much in practice because you can only use a small fraction of the pyramid's actions (so why build a pyramid of at most 14 cubes if only to offset the randomness mentioned previously), and that the necessity to take money actions all the time ought to have been designed away (because actions which you [i]absolutely need[/i] don't add anything to the game experience save as a silly optimisation procedure). The game's colourful artwork is also a bit of a hindrance: the workers really ought to have been replaced with octogons or something. But as I said, it still seems to work, and that is something.

I wonder though what is supposed to draw you back for more. Burano is a very constructed optimisation game with little actual interaction. There is a bit of jockeying for the majorities in the neighbouring islands and lace production area, plus a minor bit of timing in placing roofs. That's not a lot. And contrary to games like Trajan and Castles of Burgundy at least set player personal optimisation challenges, and those are difficult to find in Burano because of the multiplexing. All in all too many question marks which detract from a few nice core ideas.

IT works fine as a game but feels a little like they were trying to do something new, just because it was new.  Like they latched unto an idea and then built a game around it.

Why I got rid of it : As much as this wanted to be the innovative new euro game it had a mechanism (pyramid cube build) that did not seem to matter much in the game.  The mechanism felt tacked on.  If you take that away you have a average euro game.  My plays were ok but not good enough to keep.

RATING: 5.75
The building and roof placement part of the game is quite nice but over-powers the rest of the game making the fishing and lace-making elements a little redundant. I would have preferred a shorter game centred solely on the building, without the two additional sideline activities. The roof building as implemented does suffer from some randomness based on what tiles you draw. I did like the pyramid mechanic but it needs a different game to be in to have any relevance given the limited number of turns you have each round.

Seemed to be a first turn advantage in going early in the turn order to get off to a good start.

All in all a bit too much going on in terms of rules and game length for the amount of 'fun' delivered.

A solid seven for me. It is a fun game with an interesting action selection mechanic mixed with a bunch of mini games (see: Trajan). My biggest gripe with the game were the fiddly worker tokens plus the colors on two player colors were so similar it was hard to see a difference when quickly glancing at the board, potentially leading to making crucial errors. 

I got a real big Trajan vibe with this game and in the end, I'd rather just play Trajan.

Convoluted euro with it's head up it's own (admittedly attractive) behind. The theme does not inform the mechanics at all. The cube pyramid is new and interesting but feels painfully shoe-horned in with the other mechanisms some of which (buildings) are more innovative than others (fishing). Actually, the game has like five distinct elements that don't congeal at all. I hated the gender specific tokens that have ZERO to do with the game play. Publisher, why did you put something overtly sexist in your game? I look forward to other designers being inspired by some pieces of Burano, but this game should be forgotten.

This is a very intricate puzzle of a game. The most important thing of the game seems to be the timing of your actions. You want to take certain actions when you have a lot of workers on the board and other when you have few on the board. It's very interesting.

The game looks very innocent and pleasant but it hides a pretty heavy game. The wheel feels a bit clunky in mechanism but still works very well. Quite a conflicting game yet I really enjoyed playing it.

Managing the cubes and the bonuses(bonus actions) from placement is fun puzzle.  Takes a minute to consider all the variables but it comes together nicely once absorbed.

キューブの積み方や、ワーカーリングをコントロールするのはおよそ人類には不可能と思われ、結局は場当たり的になってしまう。ただ理論上はマネジメントできることになっているはずであり、とても論理的なシステムであるとは思う。しかし、慣れていけばいくほど屋根のめくりで勝負が決する懸念もあり、惜しい。

Initial rating: 6.5 (October 2016)

I have only heard positive things about Burano and, for some reason, I thought the game was from Inka and Markus Brand (Burano´s designers are Yu-Chen Tseng and Eros Lin, I don’t know either one) so my expectation was very high.

Burano´s rules are easy to grasp, but it seems there are lots of rules. You could probably explain it under 20 minutes. I say “probably” because I wasn’t the one who read the rules and the friend who did, didn’t do a good job at explaining them. We didn’t understood much until mid-game, so it wasn’t the pleasant experience I was expecting. I’m pretty sure we got some rules wrong. My friend said it was his first time explaining a complex game, the problems was that he didn’t have the rules clear for himself. I’m pretty sure he will get better at it soon (he wants to do that in a video to upload to YouTube). 

It took over 3 hours to play, that’s too much for what the game offers. The caveat is that the game explanation wasn’t good, so perhaps we can play it again in less time.

The game components are very well done, when there are lots of buildings on the board, it looks gorgeous. The art is good as well but it is confusing at times (some fishes look rather similar and workers look very similar all over the table). 

To me, Burano is, somewhat, reminiscent of Bora Bora. In both games you use male and female islanders to do different things and the game has a “Feldian” feeling.
 
Burano has a medium weight, the decision of what to do in your turn is not obvious, there are interesting and interlocking decisions, paramount of all is how to build your pyramid. To do it effectively, you need to really plan ahead. The pyramid allows you to execute different actions and those actions change randomly in each turn. The pyramid consist of colored cubes but as the actions (colors) change randomly it doesn’t really matter which cubes you keep every turn, that is, the managing of the cube´s colors is irrelevant (a negative for me because I was expecting the opposite after the game explanation).  

I’m worried about: 1. It seems weaving is much more powerful than fishing. The player who won mainly did weaving actions and he won by a lot. 2. There are luck with the cards, some of them seem very powerful and play order can affect a lot if you get a powerful one or not. I think this is a negative for me, but I need more plays to verify this point. To conclude, it seems the actions are unbalanced and luck of the draw can be too much.

Bottom line, Burano didn’t wow me as I was expecting. This could be due to the regular game explanation so I will give it another chance before getting rid of it. I’m worried about the luck of the cards, I’m still not sure if luck plays a significant role or not. I’m also worried about the actions themselves, they seem to be unbalanced. The pyramid is fun and novel. Burano isn’t for casual gamers but I expected a better game.

[floatleft][ImageID=2599157][/floatleft]Burano has a lot of little things going on, and unfortunately I don't think they combine to make a very compelling or cohesive whole. Let's start with the action selection mechanism. At the start of each season (which has 3 or 4 turns per player) players construct a pyramid out of the chunky and colourful cubes. The pyramid has a 3x3 base then a 2x2 level then a 1x1 level. There are 3 actions in the game and 6 cube colours, before construction each action is randomly associated with two of the colours. When you place a cube on the board you do the corresponding action, but you only have access to the cubes you can freely take from the pyramid (those not supporting other cubes). It comes across as a novel and interesting action selection mechanism, but in practice I found it to be needlessly elaborate. It does not provide satisfying tension or decision making options, it's a rather boring exercise. You are certain enough of your first couple of actions, and beyond that it's easy to build in flexibility. Provided you have cubes of the appropriate colours, but that's an issue I'll address next.

[center][ImageID=2721942 medium][/center]

Each player has a neat little circular thing which is used for many different purposes throughout the game (see picture below). Your workers are stored here when not in use on the board, and the three red arrows point to vacant spaces which specify three colours. If you need to place a worker on the board you remove the worker on space 1 and rotate the inner circle which changes which colours the red arrows point to. Removing a worker will also reveal either a coin or a fountain. This little system is used for a lot of different purposes:

1) When taking the income action you gain coins equal to the number of revealed coins.
2) When scoring points for placing a fountain roof-tile you score points based on the number of fountains revealed.
3) When doing the fishing action at an island the huts on the island need to match the colours the red arrows are pointing to.
4) When doing a lace making action you can place workers on coloured spaces matching those the red arrows are pointing to.
5) At the end of the round you collect cubes for pyramid construction based on the colours of your occupied spaces.

My issue with all of this is that there are too many competing interests which does not allow for thoughtful manipulation of this system. Especially when it comes to the colours the red arrows are pointing at. The only way to change them is to deploy workers, but those are precisely the actions you would want to modify the arrows for. The colours being pointed at are more-or-less random and the player has very little opportunity to smartly manipulate them. You also cannot cleverly plan on which cubes you'll receive for next round since you don't know which colours will correspond to which actions. And finally if you are trying to maximize the number of coins or fountain symbols revealed than you are at the mercy of your opponents because they can kick you off the islands easily and from lace making at a small cost. 

[center][ImageID=2720992 medium][/center]

I guess what it comes down to is that I think the game shackles creative and thoughtful play. Players do not have enough control, which feels similar to there being too much luck. It's a beautiful game, and there are things that I enjoy about it, chiefly the player interaction in the city building part of the game. Unfortunately, the bad far outweighs the good, and I would much rather play something else.

A pretty splendid experience. The color relationships between houses, islands, lace workshop and schedule wheel are beautifully implemented and very importantly for a game of this kind the color scheme has been handled very well. Game is generally a tight mix of mechanisms like area majorities and set collection and there's a lot of positive stress included in planning ahead and making sure you have enough money. There's a mini bit of rinse and repeat effect, because despite of the messy rulebook the mechanisms are simple and there aren't too many options you have to think about, but it's still quite a competitive optimization.

More a 'miss' than a 'hit'. I really like those big cubes and the pyramid building, but they are there more as an eye-catcher than actually having any role to the game itself. Burano has one of the worse rulebook I've seen in a long time, which makes things harder to catch than they actually are. Some component choices aren't great either and in the end Burano has a quite dry abstract feel, which isn't good thing especially because the game takes 120 minutes. So I guess I'm saying, that it isn't for me.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The pyramid building with blocks which determine what actions one can take is quite interesting as you must plan ahead. However, I'm not convinced that all the main actions scoring is balanced. The personal action track where you pay more dollars to take more actions is also a nice touch. Save money for those turns you need to take 4 actions as that fourth action is pricey! I've only played with two - I think I would prefer 3 or maybe even 4 player games as the board is pretty open with 2. Materials seem poorly constructed as the boards and cards tend to warp slightly. I also didn't really like that three different fish are all the same brilliant hue of orange as it can lead to mistaken identity of the card type if one doesn't look closely. Buildings appear powerful, particularly certain ones and why one would not pick up a building instead of taking 2 prestige, I am uncertain. Game felt a bit chunky - like it could have used a bit more development.

It's a decent game of worker placement that's just not worth the hype in my opinion. I found myself asking "why don't I just play viticulture or caverna"? The rulebook is terribly confusing; the phrase "fixed ordered steps" is now ingrained in my psyche because of this game. Why did the rules tell me to swap the males for females when having more or less males/females had no in game consequence? It just felt slightly awkward that this was a "rule". My biggest gripe is how the ways to get points have no synergy. I can play the "fishing" game or the "factory" game or the "building" game. But those points have almost nothing to do with one another. I will however, give the game it's due where it deserves it. This is a beautiful game and the building tile part is nice. If I was in a room of friends and this was the only game there, I'd play it.

Not a game to play after a tiring day, but, well rested this is such an interesting attempt to make a "thematic correct" game about Burano. Some gaming mechanisms should maybe have been simplified or polished, but once you get the hang of it, the game plays pretty smooth. And the game material looks so awesome. 
The pyramid mechanism is an interesting new mechanism (as far as i know).
You see the beautiful Burano appear before your eyes while playing sending your males and females fishing and producing lace. 
playing time is a bit too long (3,5 hours with 3 players). Rulebook is great. 

If you love Burano (I've been there once) and heavy EURO games, you will love this game.

Not a fan of the game.
The piramid doesnt work in concept because after the first round you will play with 9 actions ,which is plenty of actions, and its on the base making each action available.
The lace is really under powered compared to fishing and area majority. You need to give up cubes to score lace and island majority and fish markets are free. 

For me there is way to much randomness in the game. If stuff just aligns for u on luck on the rondel you having a good game. I played a game were at multiple points getting screwed over by rondel and colors not matching actions i wanted to perform.

RATING: 6
Solid game it seems, but actually after the firt play, the jury is still out on this one. The various actions don't seem to be in balance. Weaving is by far the strongest: you need to get as much of your workers on the board as quickly as possible in order to get any sort of economy going for you. Getting workers on the board via fishing works much slower, so that's a bad start. The money action is by far the worst action, it should be avoided as much as possible. But you do need money a lot, so make sure you get these workers on the board, so at least your occasional money action is worth it. Cards acquired during the game are vital for a big end game scoring. Need to play more for a better judgement.

Quite heavy. Many options and difficult to plan. Cards and lace making seem to be required for big endgames scoring. Interesting at least, but how often you'll find a group to play with? Game might not be completely balanced.

A fun game to play, but it has some characteristics that I often try to avoid now in games.  For one, the game is an absolute beast to set up and explain.  There are a lot of moving parts and many of them are lifted from other games.  Not all of the different avenues for scoring are balanced, but there is an argument they don't need to be.  The different mechanisms are generally well interlocked, but there are exceptions.  Some of  it seems to be complexity for the sake of complexity.  I hope to play it again at some point, but only with a table of players who already know the game; I am not sitting through the explanation again.

This game intigued me right from the start I saw it at Essen 2015 (were it was sold out). But the rating has gone down significantly (6.9 on 17/06/2016), so I was a bit worried. But my 1 gameplay so far confirmed my good feelings about this game. I can agree that the housebuilding in Burano is mainly a gimmick, but a very nice gimmick. It's a bit like the wheels in Tzolk'in, they are not necessary, but they mzke the game imho. Only thing is, that it is a tad too long what concerns gaming time. If it could end within 90 minutes, that would have been perfect.

This game didn't "wow" me like I wanted it to. The art and color scheme is beautiful and I purchased this because of that. I wanted to love it. 

There are 2 main objectives and you have to really focus on one or the other to succeed in this game. Because of this it was a turn off. It is very easy to compare it to Trajan, but Trajan does it better. 

This was after 1 play. I expect to play it again and really form an opinion after that. 

I liked it and want to play again, I don't know if it will end up staying in my collection.

Placing delightful colored cubes next to each other or on top of each other as an action selection method is really delightful. It's an interesting and colorful puzzle I fully enjoy. I wish I could say the same about the rest of the game. From what I've read, the second edition of the game solves a lot of the problems I've read about in the first edition, but the game still has a few issues.

There appears to be a strong first player advantage. It's not hard for the first player in turn order to grab up a few majorities and drop some big scoring roof tiles before anyone has a reasonable chance to contest them. There's no difference in starting positions for players later in turn order, and they don't have these same opportunities for scoring without battling anyone.

The house cards that are earned for placing roof tiles are of wildly different levels of usefulness. For example, all the cards that give you points are points locked in for the rest of the game, except one type of card that gives you points for each person you have in a contestable area. This appears to be an unintentional weakening from a change from 1st to 2nd edition that was paid no attention.

The game does have a lot of flip luck, in terms of what fish cards come up, which house cards are available at any given time, and what color roof tiles you randomly draw.

The last thing is the actions that you take just aren't that compelling. On your turn you get 1-4 actions, and each action you take means you spend more money. A compelling idea, but when half your actions consist of moving a cube from your pyramid to your "ready area", the efficiency and opportunities for clever moves is overshadowed by a stale feeling.

Overall, the game isn't bad for a tactical game, but it doesn't shine as a strategy game, which is a real pity as I love putting bricks on top of other bricks.

Decent looking game.  Components are a bit small and would benefit from a US or European publisher.   Never really could understand the reason for the mechanics.  Lots of various little choices to make but no real reason why you would do any of the actions available.  Theme very pasted.  Good core but needs fleshing out.

Great tactile components that are wonderfully colorful!  Almost all areas of the board have variable setup (some that change from round to round).  Unique action-list and selection mechanism leads to interesting decisions. Definitely a point salad type of game.  There can be some downtime for those with AP and / or while your opponent works through a really big turn.

Burano borrows heavily from a lot of board games already in my collection, but the pyramid action planning takes it in a fresh new direction. I especially enjoy how the pyramid is deconstructed and then built out on the shared central city where every player can then add rooftops for extra scoring bonuses, which then also feeds into grabbing unique cards that either give you a sum of points or help combo with other actions. 

There are a lot of steps required for playing Burano effectively. My first play was a harsh lesson about the repercussions of going broke. Money = extra actions, so make sure you have a money cube near the top of your pyramid just in case. Actually...make sure you have EVERYTHING ready, just in case!

A solid game with lots of sub-mechanics that interact with each other.  Not clear that the game is deep enough to justify the unintuitive complexity.

I worry that the depth-to-complexity ratio isn't great.  The overall game is a solid medium-weight euro, but the sheer number of rules to get right for the sub-mechanics makes it feel heavier than the strategy really it.  It's a good game, but it feels like the depth was bought at a high price by layer on more rules not having it emerge.  A bit more symmetry or common patterns between the sub-mechanics would have gone a long way towards making it feel clean and deep rather than a pile of unrefined awesome.

For such a thinky game, I also worry that it is mostly tactical.  You can't plan much between turns, and mostly seem to just react to your roof colors and (a bit) to your schedule colors.  Planning within a turn is tense.  Planning between turns seems impossible.  That doesn't mesh well with buildings that reward drawing certain roof colors -- can be a huge point swing but maybe not as bad as it looks.

The cube pyramid is the most novel part, but It's less influential than I had hoped.  You don't dig very far into it most rounds, and it's very puzzly to set it up right.

The rotating wheel is also neat, but fairly arbitrary unless you to a ridiculous amount of fiddly computations.  Neither feels like it is used in the right context, but both could be cool if meshed differently with other mechanics.

All in all, I'd love to see a more uniform set of mechanics, or a smaller set that are used for more things.  As is, it is a sampling of rules and tactical reactions, not a cohesive strategy game.

This game is beautiful! Previous reviews of this game are completely accurate in saying that the inspiration this game borrows from Feld games is evident. This game is about as heavy as Stefan Feld's Trajan and offers a new mechanism to replace Trajan's mancala-inspired wheel. Burano features a cube pyramid you build from large cubes of different colors in your reserve. These cubes represent houses and when built (i.e. placed on the main board) you take 1 of 3 actions corresponding to the cube's color. These colors are randomly assigned to the 3 actions each season. Within all 4 seasons of the game, there are a total of 14 rounds. Within each round, you can take up to 4 actions. However, additional actions beyond your first (which gives you a coin) cost -3/-3/-4 coins and you don't get a lot of them to start with! This game has many paths to victory and offers an interesting spatial element through the building of houses and rooftops. I'm not sure why it is rated as low as it is. I prefer the art style and graphic design of this game when compared to many of Stefan Feld's games but it is definitely not for novice to intermediate gamers.

There's cool things going on in this one. I love how you're building a three-dimensional structure in the middle of the board. I enjoy the pyramid construction mechanic for action selection. The problem here is that there are too many layers to connect the dots in an abstract way. The colors don't always mean the same things, so what actions they can invoke are different. Once you have those actions, you then need to set up the right combinations of those colors with what's going on the board in order to make them effective. I generally enjoy the puzzles boardgames present me, but in this case, I find the problem here frustrating rather than challenging. Indeed, while playing this, I felt lost in a colorful soup, drowning a sea a pastels, with victory points an obscure mirage on the horizon.

Distinctive feeling and uniquely looking design.  The 3D build up is satisfying to construct and visually appealing.  Its more complex elements seem misplaced and unnecessary, but the pyramid activation, schedule ring and time wheel are certainly inventive components.  Fresh pop to its mix of standard action point allowance, set collection and area majority.  It’s definitely a heavy Euro.  It requires careful planning, rewards optimization, restricts your resources to create tension and involves zero spiteful interaction.  Compelling and novel design – even though it may appear the same as any other at first sight. But not an exciting one.

tl;dr: solid, deep, maybe a bit too much AP

This game was getting a lot of buzz at Spiel last year and sold out before I could grab a copy. But I finally got to play it. I was a bit hesitant as the cube stacking mechanism looked like a huge AP source. But it ended up being not nearly as bad as I feared.
This is yet another solid, deep strategic euro. It has a lot of interlocking mechanisms where you need to keep track of a good deal of elements with each move. The stuff I like.
I didn't love  it though, and it can be a bit brain-burnery at times, but I'd be happy to play again!

Somewhat interesting, but:

1. The cube pyramid isn't as interesting as it sounds since you are unlikely to use very many cubes for actions in a given season (maximum possible is 8, which would require some planning, but that assumes you can pay for 4 actions each turn, which is unlikely, and that you never play roof tiles, which is also unlikely). If you want to use cubes for lace-making at the end of the season then building the pyramid is more important, but:

2. The lace workshops seem really inefficient compared to the islands. The finishing order of our game exactly matched the proportions of actions spent on fishing vs. lace-making.

3. I have no idea if the designers were inspired by Trajan (or have even seen it), but it feels a lot like Trajan in many ways, and unfortunately I think Trajan does a better job overall. (And I say that as someone who likes Trajan but certainly doesn't love it.)

4. A minor point, but the workers are really hard to tell apart. I would strongly recommend replacing them with small cubes.

Pretty game and wanted to like it, but it felt tedious and clunky.  The block building/ roof building mechanic was brilliant, but with the fishing and lace-making just felt like there was too much going on, especially once you add the wheel and the workers.  Took way too long to play and overstayed its welcome.

GAME: Star Trek Customizable Card Game (Second Edition)

RATING: 8
Very strategic and balanced game.  Has the standard "gotta catch em all" ccg aspect, but the cards are cool enough that I don't mind.

RATING: N/A
Second largest CCG collection I have. I have about 12 stream-lined decks that have remained consistent. As such I have not delved into deckbuilding in quite some time and have a wide assortment of categorized though not inventories cards. If you need something in particular, let me know.

RATING: 6
Fixed many of the problems with the original game (the play one card/draw one card problem, the long setup time), but by the time this came out, I was winding down my CCG obsession. I now play on occasion with my limited card pool. It works well as a stand-alone game.

Only played a few times, despite playing the 1st edition a lot back in the day.  Seemed more balanced, but still slow.
I'd be up for another try...

Did Decipher ever learn how to make a card game with interesting effects on cards with a rarity lower than rare? 

The engine is vastly improved over first edition.

Update 9/2016: recently I was looking through my second edition cards and boy oh boy are the BORING. First edition might be a slow, imbalanced mess but literally none of the second edition cards I have do anything interesting whatsoever. My earlier quip about rare cards is truer than I realized. Without rare events, etc., you have a pile of personnel, some missions, and dilemmas. It's impossible to build and interesting deck without those rares which is a terrible, terrible way to design a card game. 

For a while I thought that if I ever wanted to play Star Trek again it would be second edition due to the streamlining but I would probably fall asleep halfway through the game. I'd sooner put up with some of the BS from first edition. At least I have a ton of cards for that. First edition forever, live long and prosper.

I really enjoy this game.  There's some parts of 1st edition I miss (the shared space line, for one), but I feel like this is a much cleaner, improved game.  The dilemma system works really well, and the fact you have actually have some memory of what your opponent has done in order to properly foil them isn't so bad when you get down to it.

What I have is the Second Edition Combo Box (8 Starter Decks (4 each of 2 types)+ 24 Booster Packs) that I purchased through Amazon.  I also have more cards given to me from friends.  All of the decks and boosters have been open but most of them have never been played.  Almost 1,000 cards in all!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fixes all of the problems of the 1E game.  This is a quite interesting CCG, different from most of the other.  It embraces it's theme fairly well, although it does so at the expense of a little gameplay depth.  The resource management system is fairly interesting, and I'm sill not sure how to best take advantage of it, and that's a good thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I'm a sucker for most ccgs. I will not sink (anymore) money into them, however. This one was fun and I almost wish that I had discovered it when it was still new. I liked the mechanics very much. Of course, it doesn't hurt that I won my first game.

Tons of fun; a CCG without the usual I-kill-you-you-kill-me setup, making it perfect for the wife and I.  I love the indirect conflict and the double deckbuilding, and it being Trek certainly doesn't hurt.  Lots of cards available and a lot of variety in strategies on offer.

I have each starter faction (Klingon, Romulan, DS9 and Federation), as well as 24 booster packs from the first base series. 

I also have both Borg and Dominion starter decks, and 24 booster packs for Call to Arms.

All I can say is "wow". Easily the best CCG I've played. Though, the Star Trek setting helps, I really love how it's not so much about outright attacking the other players, but using other sly evil tricks to mess them up.

Pros:
*Cost system keeps the game interesting, and makes your choices really mean something.
*Factions all feel differently with different strategies character powers and ships.
*The dilemma cards really make the game feel like an episode of Star Trek, especially if you've seen many of the episodes the cards are from.
*Mission based play, rather than kill everyone based play, much like the show. Fighting can still be a viable option though.
*Easily expandable to 3 or more players.

Cons:
*At times, it seems too long for what it is.
*Cards are cheaply printed. You NEED sleeves if you want to be able to read the text after 4 or 5 plays.
*You need tons of cards for it to be fun, luckily they're pretty cheap for the first couple of boxes, but anything past the basics and you're running 40+ dollars for a booster box.

Bought some starter decks/packs but didn't play much at all. The dilemma pile is an interesting change however from trying to keep your sort/wall/etc combos in order during the annoying 1E seeding phases.

RATING: 7
I still play this very casually from time to time This edition fixes most of what was broken and bloated about Star Trek CCG First Edition by adding a cost system and streamlining the card types.  However, these fixes came at the cost of removing some of the freedom and nuance from the game.  Now most of the affiliations feel mostly the same and the game is super balanced.  It is hard to say what is more fun in the long run.  It is certainly easier to pick this one up and play without needing all of the overpowered rares to win.

I had thousands of cards...1/3 of which was ruined when my parents basement flooded while I was at college. I later came across a bulk sale in Toronto and purchased the lot.

RATING: 5
We played a good bit of this as an alternative back in the early magic the gathering days.  It was not a bad game but suffered from a lot of problems that were common to all the CCGs of the era.  This one's issues were multiplied by the fact that half the people playing just wanted to stuff as many name personalities and ships from the next generation into their deck as possible.  The finals of every tournament was romulans vs. klingons as a result.  Pretty fun combat I remember but the borg card was cheesy.  We had some serious serious rules disputes in those pre-internet days...  I remember having to set down some house rules prior to tournaments.  Good memories but not actually a very good game.

My favourite CCG ever. Always challenging, changing and fun. So balanced and so diverse, I am nearly always up for a game and keep 4+ decks ready at any one time.

RATING: 6
Star Trek CCG is a fun game, but a little clumsy. The good things about this game are its diversity in deck construction, strategy, and the fact that you can win peacefully (i.e., without engaging your opponent in combat). Some of the downfalls are the learning curve and the amount of time a game takes (esp. w/ new players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Improved version benefits from over a decade more of stories and feature films so that it can use a more narrative/conflict-based story mechanic rather than simply explore and achieve with the right combinations for success. There's also a lot more lead characters to keep the Trek fan collecting. Sadly, this game died shortly after Decipher's loss of the Star Wars license and is no longer supported.

BIG PLUS: vast improvement, strong use of theme
HUGE MINUS: no longer supported despite strong game

[b]Good game. My main problem with it is that it is a bit too complicated to play casually (unless you give pre-built decks to everyone), and the people who play competitively are years ahead of me - they've grown with the game release by release and spent a large chunk of their free time of the last 15 years exploring strategies and card synergies. I'll never be able to catch up, and I'm not willing to put that much time and effort into a single game. So this, unfortunately, doesn't get played much.[/b]

Second edition is definitely the preferred version for myself and I am looking for more cards simply to build more decks! I love variety and thinking-out-of-the-box! More cards help with that. Have started playing this once a week over morning coffee. If you need a card, let me know what you are looking for.

This started out fun and turned into an exercise in tedium. We were learning the game and how it works and have only played it once. I am starting to understand how I should have done things a little differently last night and we never had any combat or anything like that. I want to try this one again sometime soon and do everything we didn't (combat, ship to ship beaming, there is probably something else) with the hope that it will make the game more enjoyable. If the experience doesn't improve, this one will go down further.

I picked up 2E a few years ago when I got back into playing CCGs.  Different and streamlined edition compared to 1E.  It is fun and there are dedicated players everywhere.  www.trekcc.org is The Continuing Committee's website with card databases, virtual sets, tournament announcements and locations, ect.  Every card is now printable...all you need is some cards to back them in the sleeves, which can be found dirt cheap.

We only play to 2 missions as 3 tends to drag somewhat. Nice, light entertainment in that sense and also very easy to play solo.
Only succeeds because of the theme, non star trek fans should steer clear.
(Bought for some friends so I just had to order some for me too!)

Bought a bunch of this after delving into some Netflix for old Trek series.

It feels better than the 1st edition, which was a decent game. I wish I could have gotten it to the table more, but I still have decks built for a large number of factions.

An improvement over the first edition In many respects. The rules were cleaned up and simplified, which resulted in slightly more abstract representation of the theme, but in exchange for a much more balanced, interactive and compelling game. Unfortunately, this game never quite took off and Decipher lost the Star Trek license a few years later.

The rules are streamlined and the barrier of entry is much lower thatn for 1E. And even though this 2nd edition did not receive as many expansions as the 1st, the card pool is still large enough for a very fun deck building.

A fine up date of the older first edition game. New game mechanics add new depth to a streamline version of the old format. Simpler and faster to play.

Was going through a Star Trek phase when I bought this when it was new, but couldn't get into it. I had never played card games like this before, but I decided to give it a chance. Thought it was boring & my gf at the time agreed. I'm sure it's fun for those who like card games (and dig Star Trek) but this game wasn't for me

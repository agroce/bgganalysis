This is in the PR/PoF mould and is generally the sort of game I like. However, there is something that didn't quite grab me about it - possibly a bit too subtle to make it fun.

Area control along with a political component.  

The game involves trying to have the majority in a province, which results in being awarded the position of elector, which in turn is useful for receiving priviledges, as well as voting power for the emperor election.  To become emperor (through an election) is also a coveted goal, as it allows even better privileges, but note that it is not necessary to ever become emperor in order to win the game.

The mechanics involve selecting actions (open-faced cards) using money (which is tight) in order to build-up majorities, score victory points, build-up voting power, or increase future income.  There are some very innovative ideas here including the aging process (which happens to everyone each "year"), and having kids (which is determined by which cards you select).

While it's a 2-4 player game, I didn't enjoy my one 2-player game, and I think it really needs at least 3 players to fully develop the emperor voting process.  Victory points are hidden and they are VERY tight, despite the multiple ways to score them (emperor privilege, card selection, castle building, marriages, elector victories, emperor voting, elector privilege).  Most games end up being very close at the end, with the winner never being totally obvious.

This is a very thematic, high-strategy (and very underrated!) game that is also very cheap to purchase.  If you like deep, strategic games, this is a must have.

RATING: 7
This is certainly an interesting game. There is enough going on here that isn't trivial. Actions one player takes may dictate very clearly what action you would take -- or not, depending on the circumstances. I find the game to be an "uber-Euro"... it's what I think of when I think of a Euro-game. This is Euro-game squared. Not a favorite, but certainly not a bad way to spend time with friends.

I guess it could be a good game, but it is just not really appealing to me, and the outcome is too close eventhough someone has no real strategy. But that could change of course, if the players get more experienced.

The name of the game is victory points, so it's about getting elected in different areas as much as possible, because that will maximize your points.  A lot of things going on in this game, a tad hard to explain, but well worth the pay-off in the end.  Great game!

I simply can't find anything wrong with this game.  It is very strategic, not hard too learn, and has some interesting mechanics - especially the aging which I just thought was cool.  It is comparable in weight to something like Puerto Rico.  It is more of a gamer's game.

Rating after 3 plays. Lots going on here, with some great mechanisms and a very nice theme. Gameplay seems to have a flow to it that I can't quite put my finger on.
A little worried that the emperor is underpowered, but that may be because people are overvaluing the position currently. Needs more plays.
Rating could rise or fall - hard to tell. A lot to enjoy right now, though.

Update - haven't played in quite some time. Few are interested. I remain hopeful.

Played as a 3 player game with Silverbeard (17 pts), Grooven (17 pts), and myself (16 pts). We set up the game while reading the rules, so the initial aristocrat placement was (poorly) selected before all the rules were finished. Fantastic game - once you've played a round, very easy to pick up the rules and general strategy. I think it'll be better with 4 players as a bit more competition would have been ideal. Final score too close really, but then again, we didn't set everything up correctly from the start. For some reason, reminded me of Caylus, but way better in terms of knowing what to do next and theme. The aging aristocrat function is well done.  

*** UPDATE: Played with 4 players, definitely ideal with tons of interaction. However, player that won picked up 8 points in first round and got most of his points from maintaining his emperor-hood to end the game with 18 points - we should have changed the emperor more often, since grooven's other points came from 2 take overs only. As for myself, I ended with 16 points, but did poorly in the beginning by being in highly competitive electorates and only having 5 points for the majority of the game. ***

Tracked on family game list (grooven).

Good area control eurogame. The rules are very clear and the game is full of choices and it is very tight on money. Nice sum of mechanics. I like that your family members grow older and eventually die (this can happen faster if your opponent poison you!) and I also like the simple having kids and weddings mechanic. There is a lot of player interaction. It is also worth noticing that the game does NOT reward you for keeping the control of the various areas, so it forces you to constantly move around and take control of other player's areas. There is nothing random in the game which can cause AP to some players. The artwork is sub-par which takes away some of the theme. Another negative is that the game really needs 4 players to shine.

RATING: 5
Clever and not too complex, a forerunner of games like Hawaii and Tzolkin which ARE too complex, at least for my taste. It's almost like chess-- no luck (not my favorite) and you need to look a move or two ahead and understand the effects of all the action cards. At least you have only about a dozen choices and five rounds, unlike the hundreds of combinations in the two games mentioned above. There are births and deaths here, a la Village, and marriages, too. If it had a luck element and were less complex, it'd rate much higher with me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very slick game about dynastic politics.  I felt like I was thinking about the same sorts of decisions that real medieval politicians had to think about -- where there's a power vacuum because of an aging ruler, who is likely to gain power due to advantageous marriage, and so forth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rating based on just one play.  

I liked this a lot and the rating may climb.  It uses a few common mechanisms well -- card drafting, area majority, and resource management.  But what made it stand out was how well the theme fit onto it.  I liked the idea that you were controlling people that got married, had children, aged and died.  Even though it was a solid Eurogame, the theme was really well expressed.

I'm eager to try this some more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game with four players (not so good with 3). Basically a kind of area-control game, with the additional twist of aging and dying game pieces (which I find to be implemented brilliantly).
Some difficult decisions, and (if the players want it) plenty of ways to strike deals with each other.

RATING: 8
i wasn't sure what to make of it after my first play.  i've played quite a bit online at mabiweb though, and it's really grown on me.  very intricate, and a surprisingly good blend of euro and american feel.  gotta respect the small box too, although it could be smaller!  probably one of the most overlooked games in recent years.  solid, interesting mechanics with plenty of interaction and room for negotiation.  very sensitive to varying skill levels.  play with 4P.

RATING: 8
Very interesting design. The voting and child-bearing mechanisms make up for the fact that this is an area majority game (which I generally despise). Otherwise, the only negative aspect of this game is that it needs four players.

A fun game with a healthy dose of "take-that". It might become too chaotic to be a truly thoughtful game at times, though.

UPDATE: The more I play it, the better I become. However, the more I play it, the more I wish I was playing a better area majority game (like El Grande). It seems to have a limited replayability. Down to a 6.

Very, very dry. I much prefer to play it online than to sit and wait while other people think forever in person. However, I do like the game. The planning is both strategic and tactical. Knowing when to give up in an area plays a major part in the game.

Played a 3-er game where I won the game with a score of 22(-21-20). Game came down to the emperor vote, which could have gone either way. Needless to say, not a very satisfying win and from now on, I'll only consider this with 4. Definitely some interesting mechanics, decisions. Perhaps a bit fiddly... A tentative 7 for now (a 5 or lower with 3).

UPDATE (2006/03/25): Still a tentative 6-7 after a 4er game. Definitely on the fiddly and non-intuitive side.

Egyedi a játék, ami tetszik! Az idősödés, szaporodás ötletesen van megoldva. A nyilvános pénz jó, és sok alkatrészt spóroltak vele:) Az uralkodó leváltása viszont elég egysíkú, nem hoz túl sok döntési lehetőséget (hisz még 4 játékos esetén is csak 2 ember van tényleges döntési helyzetben). Ami még  hiba szerintem, az az, hogy az egyes lapkák (nemesek) koraira nagyon oda kell figyelni, nehogy az átrakás közben elfelejtsük. Még játszanom kellene vele, elsőre jónak ítélem, de nem kiugrónak. A kivitelezés átlagos.

In the Shadow is a gamer's game of area control.  It has a great theme and interesting mechanics.

Although it works with three, it feels slightly less optimal.

After playing and enjoying it, I cannot imagine trading it now!  UPDATE:  Seems to really only play well with four people - slight downgrade. ANOTHER UPDATE:  Game seems to give advantage to the first emperor.

A game unlike any other games. Change is rewarded more than empire building, to some it might seem chaotic. The game mechanics are so intricately intwined that you may not appreciate them at first. The theme is very lively and well fitted to the game. In my opinion it's not suitable as a negotiation game and negotiation should be kept to a minimum. Just play it as it is supposed to be, a quick, tactical, opportunistic game.

A different type of area majority game.  It took a little bit but it clicked quite nicely for me. I like how you have to balance keeping an area that you benefit from with the need to win other areas.  Also because of aging, you have to keep on your toes.

Update: Started playing this in person now, and it's a much better game in person (which is saying alot).  Bumped up to a 9.  Need to get a fourth who love it as much as three of us do to get it to the table more.

Probably my second-favorite game, a fun, heavy game that is very heavy with the best moves being very conditional on what everybody else is doing.

Edit:  I still love this game, but no longer my second-favorite.  Others that I've had a chance to play have moved in front.  Still top ten.

Interesting game that sat on my shelf for quiet some time. Finally played a three player game. I liked it a lot. 
I loved the mechanic where your aristocrats age and ultimately die. Which balances the game. Scored it 7.5, as I will replay it, but not sure when. I have better alternatives for better games now on the market. Reminds me a bit of El Grande.

I'm reminded of Emperor Joseph in Amadeus: "A few too many notes".  That's exactly how I feel about this game.  It's an area majority game with a lot of management issues.  I found it difficult to teach.  In the end, people didn't find the theme worthy of the complexity and not much fun was had.

A very different kind of game! First game with 4 players was very close, and filled with decisions and conflict as players jostled for position in the electorates. The fiddly level was not apparent to me, but each phase went smoothly and made sense with the theme. Highly tactical as each play has the potential to influence a shift in the balance of power if a proper reaction is not forthcoming. I was the Emporer in turns 2-5, but lost the lead and game on the very last play by overlooking the placement of my married Baron in a spiritual electorate that would have won the game (he needs to be single to rule!). Both plays were with new players, which prolonged the game well beyond the 90 minute mark. The action cards offer a lot of choices which takes time to digest.

RATING: 8.5
A complex game with an underlying mechanism of area control but with many layers added on top. Very thematic: aging, begetting children, marrying them off.

A gamer's game; not one I would bring out with casual players. This one was totally under the radar until I had the pleasure of playing it.

There can be a lot of AP!! Be warned. Literally, there can be kingmaking and point spreads are super tight so results may not be meaningful.

This is a fascinating game with plenty of action and interaction. I like the fact that each choice is tempered with tough choices and an awareness that by choosing option a, you are falling behind in options b, c, d and so forth. There are a myriad of choices and paths to follow, the level if interaction is high and players have the opportunity to make or break each other on a regular basis, this is not a game for the faint hearted. So much for euros being all multi-player solitare!

I have really enjoyed playing this game a lot, due to the nature of having so many options and only being able to pick one, as well as the fact that players have plenty of opportunities to mess with one another makes for a game that is unusually filled with tension. Altogether great fun!

RATING: 9
[31/12/07] I a general effort to lower my game collection's ratings, I've decided to downgrade this superb game's rating by a nudge despite it continuing to be my favourite eurogame together with El Grande (with the K I expansion). Why.
- Lacks out of the box support for 5 players. See my suggestions on the subject.
- 2 player game is admittedly too unforgiving (finally changed my view on this one after much deliberation). But once you use the variant I suggest, it IMO equally provides a splendid gaming experience.


[13/04/05]The game's clever mechanics do a marvelous job in bringing the turbulent politics of the post-Staufer Medieval Holy Roman Empire to life in which the power of the Emperor was waning, whilst the electors and princes (Landesfürsten)became ever more powerful. Dynastic politics became the primary concern of both the current emperor and his grandees - at the expense of the ideals of the Holy Roman Empire.

Im Schatten des Kaisers offers a multitude of subtle balances and  numerous viable and equally attractive routes to victory.

The game's elegance is compelling. There is no dice or card luck. Further, apart from the VP scores, players have perfect information. What is more, dynastic politics, marriages & all, are good fun. We always get to have our laughs. 

So, if you like political games such as Kreml or El Grande, challenging well-balanced gamers' games with a very strong theme, the right amount of interaction and numerous routes to victory, this should be right up your alley. 

A note of caution: Don't jump to premature conclusions regarding gameplay and balance merely based on your first playing as annoyingly a number of BBGers - judging from their below entries - have (e.g. suggesting the imperial office is too weak, too powerful, etcetc, remains always in the same hands and similar - sorry to say - uninformed nonsense). Further, once you're familiar with the game, play time should drop to round 90 minutes - as the box suggests. And as with any heavyweight, make sure you're playing this game with the right crowd. Challenging gamers' games simply aren't for everyone.

How does it scale? The 2P game is drastically different from the 4P version. The former plays in a very chess-like manner and offers plenty of tough decisions. Much as Chess, it is also very unforgiving and may become quite onesided in case of the players not being comparable in skill. Hence, the 2P version will not appeal to everyone. Nonetheless, it's a great way to play this game in its own right and I consider it as good as the 4P version. The same cannot be said about many other multiplayer games (e.g. El Grande, Euphrat & Tigris or Puerto Rico). 

The 4P version plays entirely differently and the focus shifts more to  the uncertainty regarding the imperial election rather than the challenging 1-1 battle the 2P version happens to be.

With three players, the imperial election will often - if not always - be decided by the "neutral" player. I still consider that fun (others may differ) contrary to what I had expected. However, the game truly shines in its 2P and 4P incarnations (the latter being the more accessible and probably most people's prefered version).

Im Schatten des Kaisers has become an instant hit with our gaming group and hits the table at virtually all of our gaming evenings ever since having first played it four months ago - with no sign whatsoever of abating and continuing to spur lively post-game debate. 

This game belongs into the Pantheon of German gamers' games alongside El Grande, Puerto Rico and Euphrat & Tigris. And as far as we're concerned, it deserves the place of honour.

Definitely a thinker. There are so many ways to get victory points. I like the way the game rewards players for playing aggressively and the mechanics of aging and descendents. In fact you have to play aggressively in my opinion to win. It takes a few plays to appreciate the game fully as there are so many different options to keep track of. Has been tagged as a Gamer's Game and I would tend to agree. It is difficult to teach for a first play - best way to learn is to play through.

Has a unique feel for area majority. The aging and marriage mechanics are awesome. However, I think the scoring mechanisms could be more interesting. The game forces you to move to different regions often in order to score, but since everyone is moving, it isn't all that difficult to pull off. Give these mechanics to Knizia to create a scoring system and you've got a classic. On the other hand, any game where you win by suicide(as I did in my 1st play) has alot going for it.

Area majority game where your guys can resproduce and also die due to old age.  This is a very neat mechanic, especially combined with the medecine power where you can kill off someone else's guys.

RATING: 8
Slightly fiddly but engrossing perfect information game.  The one constant in the game is that you must always change your position for stasis earns no VPs.  This leads to a constant challenge of figuring who wants to move where next and in what force.  In turn this results in transient alliance/value trades between players where the delta value is alarmingly difficult to determine.

While I've enjoyed every game I've played, I'm increasingly concerned that in every case nobody has known why the winner won.  This is worrisome, especially as games tend to be very close (less than 5% between first and last).

My first impression of this game leaves me kind of unsure whether I like it.  There are some neat innovations.  I particularly like the aging of your nobles (your means of influence over the various regions).  

I also like the tension between spending your money early to claim the action cards you want before they're gone vs stalling and saving money until other players declare their intentions (and you hide yours).  

But it did seem easy for a player to become entrenched in a particular province, locking up that action.  The trade-off is that you get VPs only for taking over new provinces....so maybe that's not such a big issue. I like this more after a repeat playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Overlooked, pure and simple. I don't know how a Hans im Glueck game slipped under the radar, but it happened, and it's too bad. On its most mundane level this is an area influence game, but toss that aside, this one is no more of an area influence game at its heart than something like Macher, which means it incorporates that, but there's much more going on.

The entire game whirls around a small pool of actions with the classic "I want to do A, B, and Z and have to choose only one" agony abounding. Without going into heavy detail, the area majority fight is incredibly multi-tiered with many nuances, as there are several types of pieces, each with varying powers within the provinces, and then, like Liberte, an additional overall election at the end of all the mini provincial elections. Each province also grants special powers to the office holder, and as you can see just from the capsule, there are a ton of things going on.

I sort of think of this game as a cross between a Wallace and a Kramer game: it has the tightness of actions that Herr Kramer is famous for, but all the special abilities that seem to characterize Wallace's games. 

Really solid title though, one of the best from this year, and well worth a try or two for fans of heavier games.

Kaiser (= the Dutch title) I bought on hearsay, and with hindsight, I wish I had playtested first. Despite what it says on the box, Kaiser does not work with two without unofficial rule modifications: it is too easy for one player to remain Emperor and frustrate the hell out of the other. With four, the game is 'as intended', offering tons of ways to tweak, scheme, and attack. And that's precisely the rub. I like strategy games best when the rules are simple, and you are dependent on your own creativity to make the most of it. Kaiser just has so many options, exceptions and differences amongst the kingdoms that it is genuinely hard to think about what you're doing, or going to do, or even worse, should have done. Often your plan needs last-minute adjustment because others make moves which you hadn't foreseen: sometimes they work in your favour, and sometimes they do not. It is a sure sign of player-induced chaos, and as previous experience with El Grande, Maharaja and even Revolution showed, I dislike such games. Kaiser also requires you to do a lot as player, and the end result is that the game begins to drag. Not necessarily in a bad way, but not pleasantly either. In the end, when the winner is determined, it is not always clear why that person won. The game simply seems to lack direction. This might be alleviated with further play, but I can't see that happening anytime soon: you need a special kind of person to play Kaiser against a few times. I can clearly see why people like Kaiser and speak highly of it, but for me, it is just an excercise in long, hard thinking in a stifling setting without much satisfaction. Eventually traded away.

[b]Update[/b] Great fun to revisit this ancient comment of mine, with the added benefit of at least 8 or 9 years' worth of gaming experience, and see how it holds up. Not that well, I'm afraid.

Kaiser (I'm still using the Dutch title) is a slightly contrived area majorities game with a simple voting procedure; and the rather unusual twist that influence in areas deteriorates over time unless 'refreshed'. This might actually prove to be a good thing as it recycles your main source of influence, and gives you the opportunity to move in somewhere else... because in a somewhat odd rules twist only actually unseating an active Elector will bring in VPs. Moving in [i]is[/i] difficult to accomplish, however, since areas tend to get rather full, and cities will weigh in heavily as well. It is here, in the combination of the amount of special actions and somewhat lacking fluidity, that Kaiser takes on a cramped feel. It doesn't help that the material is slightly fiddly, and easily upset. But as bad as my memory and comment seem to have made it out, no, not by a long shot. This is a Good Thing.

That said, the voting procedure for determining who becomes Emperor tends to be an afterthought rather than something you plan for: influence can suddenly be aged out of existence causing the current Emperor to weigh in with his tie-breaking opinion; and once you survive that there are still a few cards which might or might not cause votes to appear or disappear at a time you can do little but sit back and let it all happen.

Finally, VP gathering is broken up into tiny amounts which figuratively speaking come in from all over the place. Daughters marrying, being Emperor, becoming Elector, building a city, an action card, ... The sentiment that this evokes—the winner not really knowing [i]why[/i] he won—hasn't changed in those years. It is this aspect that I think bugs me most about the game, and which prevents me from enthusiastically delving into it more. 

In the end I've decided to raise the unfair 4 the game had gotten to a 5; had there been more 'direction' in how to go about obtaining VP Kaiser would easily have gotten a higher rate still. But as it stands the game is more of a simulation of the political life of the Holy Roman Empire rather than an actual game with conflicting goals and means to achieve those goals.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** De este juego se habló poco pero me ha parecido bastante bueno.

Juego totalmente independiente del idioma que usa un sistema de mayorías al cual le añade como novedad la variante tiempo.

Aunque no se parezcan en nada me dejó un gusto similar al Caylus ya que no tiene factor suerte (solo al seleccionar quien empieza la partida) y también en este vas seleccionado en cada ronda cosas que solo se pueden escoger una vez (generalmente) cada turno, en contra puede que algunas cartas o poderes estén descompensados y que ser emperador es cuanto menos muy poderos, recomendable sobre todo con su bajo precio, casi la mitad que el Caylus y seguramente sea más divertido que este y algo más corto.

2007-10: just arrived in a trade.  First play was a four-player learn-as-you-go game.  It was fun.  Like the pink versus blue cards dilemma - you really want that pink card, but you need to get another baron into play, so you just have to find a way of making a blue card work for you - or do you?  Lots of things to consider and lots of agonizing decisions to make.  What with the game being an area control game where you choose your actions from the cards, it reminds me of El Grande and that's not a bad thing, in my books!

Second game was a two-player game with my son.  Not surprisingly, it's better with more people, but it was still okay.

After three plays, I still don't have a good handle on this game - but I like it. We'll see which way my opinion drifts with further play.

[A year later - my opinion has drifted towards "less enjoyable with novice players", as first-time players seem to invariably get attached to holdings and bitterly contest any attempt to take over "their" provinces. While this is a losing strategy, in the process it makes play much less fun for whomever is suddenly up against irrationally strong resistance. I don't fault the game for this, but it does make me less inclined to break it out much.]

RATING: 4
Components: Quality, half-sized cards; sturdy tiles; complex but understandable iconography.

Experience: This really isn't my sort of game. It feels to me like Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, and Goa, in that there is very little luck, and players are slowly pushing pieces around, gaining a bit of power here, a bit of influence there, and there is plenty of opportunity for thinking ahead and developing a master plan. However, I prefer quicker, simpler games with fewer options. Considering the theme, I'll take Burkert's word on it that the game is capturing the feel of Germany in the middle ages; but for me, I was just moving tiles around trying to collect cards with numbers on them.

This is really an interesting game.  Plan on one good, long, session to learn it. Actually it's not that long, unless people are prone to AP.

Changed my rating to a 10, after playing several games online and finally "getting it." Discovered this is a well balanced, interactive, and strategic masterpiece.

If you are playing with experienced players, it becomes chess-like in some ways. There are often clearly optimal moves for players, so you can often predict your opponent's future actions, based on your actions.

This game requires a very particular sort of thinking ahead. Your "workers" age over time and die, so your influence in the various areas wanes over time without infusions of new workers.

When playing a two-player game, the starting player has a definite advantage. One way to address this is to play a two-game series, alternating the start player. Add the scores of both games together for the final score.

Another 2-player variant is to give the second player a 35-year-old Baron instead of his 45-year-old Baron. Also, the Emperor does not win ties for Electorates. A tied Electorate is vacated.

Complete information, deterministic area control game, replacing randomness with a plethora of available actions.

Differently from standard area control game, ItSotE penalizes static gameplay, providing victory point only to changing controlling power in each area.
Some mechanics such as ageing and descendants are interesting. Well themed.

Since a votation system is embedded, il looks like the right number of player is the maximum allowed (4).

Having only played this once, it did not seem like what I'd call a fun game.  The decisions were more of the "this is better for my game, but who cares" variety.  Still, I'd probably play again just to see if that changes.

RATING: 5.5
This might have been an excellent game if it were somehow streamlined and stripped down to its essence.  As it is, it is way too fiddly and complicated.  Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad game, if you are prepared to put the effort into it, but it is probably the among the least elegant of all game designs I have encountered, so much so that I have absolutely no desire to play the game again any time soon.  It looks interesting enough at first, but after a while it just feels flat, uninspired and about as much fun as an average toothache.

RATING: 5.5
This is perfectly fine area control game.  There are a several cool mechanics going on that make sense with the theme (like aging) that adds to the game play.  

My biggest complaint is that there is too much information on the board by the end of the game.  Since this is a perfect information area control game, it leads to a fair amount of AP.  The last two turns can sometime grind down to a halt.

Another complaint I have is that by the end of the game, your options are sometimes very limited in unintuitive ways.  Like you have lots of money and options, but you want one of your old guys to die so you can have a baby.  The mechanics work fine for the end game, but they don't work as well with the theme as they did earlier.

If you like are control games (which I don't tend to like), you should definitely try this one.  It is a solid game.

Liked this game - a good connection between theme and mechanics. There is an obstacle to initial play in that you really need to know what each of the action cards and free province actions do before you can play anywhere near properly.

There may be some issues as to how many players this really supports - struck me it may only work with 4 and only 4.

Will probably try and pick up a copy.

Interesting game that works best with 4 players it seems. I like the mechanic that you have to get the power in a province to score points, just not hold it. This means that it's better to lose control from time to time so you can take it back.

Got this from a math trade.  I'm pretty happy with the game.  It has decent theme for a euro...with a good amount of screwage.  The emperor election didn't really work though.  Early emperor seems really valuable and difficult to dislodge w/out sacrificing position.  It may get bumped up to a 7 w/more plays, but I think this may be a solid 6.  I don't like how it only seems to play well with 4 players.

Update....I'm going to bump this up to 7.  I finally got this to the table again.  It is a tight, clean design with some good depth.   Must play with 4 for emperor election to work. Don't take Rival card unless you can win!  :)

RATING: 4
During the majority of my first play of In the Shadow of the Emperor I was impressed. All of the individual pieces seemed to fit together from the fact that individual provinces are only scored if you take them over, to the well balanced action drafting where you have to consider both whether you want to spend money for the appropriate actions as well as if you want your opponent to get the action and what sort of progeny you want to produce, to the neat aging mechanic that forces you to consider how long individual pieces are really going to be on the board. Unfortunately all the positive feelings built up during game play drifted away once we hit final scoring. There was a two point disparity between first and last place, and the only reason there was not a smaller disparity, is because one of the players arbitrarily decided that another one would be the one to win the game, rather than there being a three way (!!!) tie. 

I have no problem with particularly tight games, as long as it is a result of a particularly tight game being played, but based on how the points are given out in In the Shadow of the Emperor, I expect that scores this tight would be the norm rather than something unusual no matter what the relative play level is between participants. I have not given up on In the Shadow of the Emperor, and will be giving it some more play to see if my expectation of this being a recurring problem ends up being correct, but right now I feel a bit sour on the game

RATING: 7
Intriguing game representing the power struggles in the Holy Roman Empire.  Players are attemping to gain victory points by a variety of manipulative means - becoming Electors, the Emperor, supporting the Emperor, marrying off daughters, etc.  Players use a purchase action system to tweak majorities in electorates, become Elector in an electorate, then use that Elector power to have a say in who becomes Emperor.  Lots going on, nice timing elements, and all luck free.  A lot of game in a small box.  Excellent (although the English rulebook is riddled with typos.)

I like the aging mechanism and the action selection, but it's still an area-majority game at its heart.  And the voting mechanism doesn't really work when only (at most) 2 players' votes matter, especially if you allow deal-making discussion beforehand (which I think you should).  I need to try it again, though.

RATING: 7
Though appearing to be a small untimidating sort of game at first glance, do not be fooled. This is a very very long, heavyweight game of elections and politics in Europe. And a great one too, emphasizing tactical skills over lying to your friends. But it clocks in at 4-5 hours though, so I don't want to hear any whining about Die Macher or Dune anymore from my friends who like this one ! Has a few novel mechanisms, especially the way in which the actions you choose determine the gender of your offspring! Elegent solutions all over the place in fact, and surely one which demands repeated plays.

UPDATE: I really want to try this one again. I think I was way too turned off by a poor three-person game of this (while everyone says it's really best with four anyway). Maybe I'll pick this up for cheap somewhere but I'm not in any big hurry..

This is an interesting game with some cool mechanics, but I think that it has two problems: first, when they say "2-4" they really mean four players only, and the three other players have to really coordinate against the Emperor to make it worthwhile. Traded it away, but I'd be willing to give it another try with the full compliment of four if we all knew what we were doing...

Physically beautiful game, but game play just didn't grab my imagination.  The theme seemed poorly integrated to me.  Game choices seemed evident, without much difficult decision making.  The potential value of most actions can be accurately approximated through calculation, so over-analysis could be a problem in some groups.  Rating of 5.33 is a composite of my rating (5) and the ratings of my wife and sister (6 and 5, respectively).

A lot of game for such a small package. This game is unique in that it has a two-tier "election" system. The bottom tier is area influence, and the winners of those 7 areas get to vote for the results of the top tier. There's a lot of potential for screwage and leader bashing, but is really a blast if you don't mind thinking.

I liked it every bit as much as I thought I would.  I am normaly leery of perfect information, no-luck games, because of the potential lack of replayability and reliance on tactical play.

But there is so much going on in this game (with relatively simple rules) and multi-player chaos, that it seems impossible that the game could slip into sameiness. 

One play with 4 - I knew the rules and taught the game but the strategic planning requirements destroyed my little brain.  If I can figure out what to do in future plays I think my rating will go up.

I find some absolutely brilliant aspects here. First, moves are carried out via action drafting with different costs for the actions but also action cards are blue and some are pink. Depending on how many of each color you have at the end of a turn, you'll have a boy (new piece to put on the board) or a girl (send her to the convent for a coin). More games should pick up on the dual nature action cards. 

Then there's the aging mechanism whereby the pieces you have on the board to, you know, control your areas age each turn by rotating their square playing piece. After age 45, they retire (or die off, whatever), so hopefully you're having lots of baby boys (but the pink action cards are so powerful!). 

The third unique element I love is the way interaction is encouraged by you only score for areas you take over each turn, not already control. Rather than people camping out in areas, the board becomes this rolling wave of area majority positioning -- though you do get the bonus power associated with areas you control so  maybe you do want to fight to stay in some.  The action is tense on every move as action cards start to disappear especially the few "move one of your pieces" cards. The turn ends with one player being elected emperor and you'll want to make sure that bounces around the table as much as possible in this five turn game.

Detractors point out that it's a very dry and thinky game (yep, sure is) and that the point spreads are too close as to be meaningful. I love the thinkiness here, and so far I haven't had a problem with how close the scoring is as the rest of the game's pros outweigh the cons. As far as area control games, you can have El Grande, I'll take iTSotE every time.

An intricate game with LOTS of tough decisions.  Something that prevents me from giving it a higher score is that the rules take a while to explain and it seems that the level of complexity could be just a little higher...four players voting for one of two people to be emperor isn't terribly interesting.  Also I seem to have found a strategy that tends to win.  Needs support for a fifth player.

RATING: 5.5
Pretty complex game, but with an innovative aging system. A bit weird though that you can keep lowering the age of one particular character, like it would have found the secret of eternal life. The game isn't the most attractive one and might drag a bit as long as you aren't fully used to the rules yet. And many decisions to take in the action phase isn't helping either. We found ourselves constantly checking the rules for the working of all those action cards.

We only played half of a 2 player game, but each with 2 colours. Perhaps that wasn't the smartest idea. The colour (randomly chosen) as starting kaiser managed to easily stay kaiser and ran away further and further. That's why we didn't even bother finishing the game. I also guess the game isn't that interesting with only 2 players, but we'll for sure give it another try with a full squad.

So for now a 6, but this could go up to a 7 if the game runs better next time or drop to 5 if it stays equally awkward.

RATING: N/A
First impression is very good.  I was lucky to have someone who knew the game well teach me how to play- I'm not sure I would have understood it by myself.  The people rotate like units in a Columbia block wargame to simulate age and are removed when they expire.  They're sort of like little turning cogs in a voting machine that spits out results every turn.  Overall it felt like there was lots of room and few pieces for an area majority game.  I liked how the game encourages you to jump around and not just turtle in a spot.  It always seemed like there was somewhere you could go to win an election in each turn.  

For the price this is an excellent game that makes you want to play with the cardboard voting machine and see how it all works.  It will hit the table soon-maybe two player so I can work on getting the mechanics down...

We played with hidden scoring, which I liked.

RATING: 7
[Area Majority, Special Actions, Special Powers, Negotiation, Political] [4P:7] In the Shadow of the Emperor is, at its essence, a complex game of musical chairs. Players utilize special actions, which are in limited supply, to place aristocrats and knights and build castles in seven electorates of the Holy Roman Empire. The key mechanism that keeps everything moving is that retaining power in an electorate does not confer victory points - seizing control does. However, you need to hold on to power to use the privileges that come with control of an electorate. However, there are other routes to VPs, including being Emperor (seems comparatively strong at first, until you do the math and find out it's not really that bad, and you become a huge target), controlling a certain electorate and outright buying VPs. The most intriguing mechanism of ItSotE is the aging of your aristocrats. Each turn, your aristocrats advance 25% of their lifespan. Despite the below-par rulebook, ItSotE has the expected HiG high quality presentation. The game's graphic design is distinctive. I like it a lot. Overall, this is an interesting title in the ever-crowded area majority game genre, and it's well worth a look. Rating can go up as the game gets shorter from experience.

**** OLD COMMENTS: March 2005. Will this finally be an area-influence game that I'll like? Sounds promising, but still very cautious since area influence games tradionally land on my list of suckage. *** UPDATE: Comments not strong enough to justify hazarding the area majority mechanism. Dropped from wishlist, may revisit later. [Just acquired August 2005]

Die stiefmütterliche Behandlung wird dem Spiel nicht gerecht. ISDK kann es auch Geburtsjahre später mit späteren Genregrößen aufnehmen. Das minnesängernde Klagen über das starre Artwork kommt nicht aus meiner Burg. Es ist als formale Entsprechung des spätmittelalterlichen Themas stilistisch konsequent. Der Kaiser im Spiel ist stark und geniesst Machtvorteile. So war das damals eben. Das Altern der Barone ist eine charmante Idee, das Verheiraten der Töchter hat sich ein Hofnarr ausgedacht. Und das Ganze in angenehm kleiner Schachtel. Wenn ich wie du ein Kurfürst wäre, ich täte es mir schnellstens kaufen, wenn ich es nicht schon hätte.

I´ve played this game a few times now and it is indeed an interesting game with some neat mechanics. Also it's alot of game for the money spent. My biggest concern is that maybe it's a bit too unforgiving when it comes to getting behind pointswise early in the game. It seems really hard to get back in the game after a bad start. Also the game gets a bit static in the last turns when everyone has lots of pieces on the board, but perhaps thats just me lacking enough games to see the options and possibilities for those nice moves in the endgame. All in all a good game and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Rating based on 3 plays at mabiweb. Very good design. Lots of things going on. Many interesting decisions, but not too many. Great mechanism od giving birth, aging the nobles and dying.
Unfortunately it's not enough dynamic (on the web). I'll never turn down a game, but only with 4.

Makes my head hurt.  I do like random elements in games, but the luckless aspect of this game fits well with the theme and mechanics.  I may never win at this game, but I definitely appreciate the unique game play.  I love two things in particular - the aging of barons through the turning of tiles, and the blue/pink cards determining the gender of offspring.

The game isn't the easiest the grab in the beginning but once you get it it's rewarding. Lots of choices, some very nice ideas. There sure is interaction and you need to play it dynamically and a bit aggressively to win, which is noce.

This game really does give a good historical feel for the era.  

Marrying off daughters, grooming sons for leadership positions, and assassinating rivals in the framework of church and state politics all add up to an interesting Machiavellian experience.

Attaining Victory Points does not feel quite as satisfying or as intuitive as in other games, but it is still fun to play.

I generally don't like area control games, but my rating on this rises the more I play.

Although functional, the board is pretty busy and the colors are crazy colorful.  Nothing evokes the theme of Germany in the middle ages better than bright yellows, orange, violet and magenta.  The gameplay is interesting and there are some great choices to be made.  You really have to watch how old people are getting, and you have to weigh the benefit of staying in power in your areas and using the special ability or losing power so that you can re-take it and get those victory points.  The game for me is a bit fiddly and strangely dry.  It feels more like an intellectual  exercise than a game about rising to power.

RATING: 8
After a few dozen plays it's difficult to know how to rate this game. I want to rate it higher but a few things hold me back. First, the rulebook isn't laid out as carefully as it could be nor is it thorough enough considering the amount of unique situations that can arise. This ambiguity and fiddlyness often leaves you feeling like you haven't played right or to the best of your ability.

Having said that, there is no questioning the elegance of the design. The game is very well balanced with every decision being crucial to determining what electorates you might win (and thus what options you will have in the next round), whether your descendant will be a son or daughter, keeping your aristocrats alive and active and last, but not least, what is to happen to the emperor. It's a fascinating tactical struggle but a little difficult to remember all the rules.

More plays are needed, I feel, until I truly feel at home with it. I have mostly played 3 player which can be a bit unbalanced.

RECEIVED: 2016

Like Colonialism or El Grande, this game gets flack for its art direction but I love the old, theme-less look of the board and cards. And, no surprise for me, the area majority mechanic is a winner. Other factors that make for extremely good game play is the aging mechanic, card drafting, and elections. 

I think there are also some fair criticisms of the game. The biggest one to consider is that, due to the elections, it only works at four players. I think there might also be runaway-leader/king-maker issues, which are more pronounced if you play points open like I prefer. While these criticisms along with the art are fair, I really don't care. However, the only thing that I find fault with the game is that it may be a little too long and, thus, too samey after a while. Maybe it would work better with one round less.

Two plays face-to-face, plus five more online. Good stuff, very meaty, very tense. Feels like a Warfrog game but without any rough edges. My only complaint is that at the end of the game it's possible that the emperor and the rival will be the two point leaders and so the other players must essentially vote for who wins (not directly of course, but you know what I mean). When playing with hidden scoring, a lot of the game can come down to who is best at convincing the table that they're not winning.

One of my favorite "strategic" games. Struggle of gaining control of areas, but needing to yield them to your opponents so that you can get points in subsequent turns is nice. The aging aspect of your aristocrats, and the creation of descendents based upon the cards that you select on your turn make this a unique and enjoyable game.

RATING: 8
Very interesting game!I played my first couple of games disregarding some rules, but when I got it right, this game's a real killer!I wouldn't say that it has something to do with Kremlin like other people here on the BGG have said: the main difference lies in information, as in Kremlin you have hidden influence to deal with, but in ITSOTE you know perfectly what is going on.This IS a very neat political game. It has the advantage that it can be played with non-gamers. Be warned that the game's very hard to explain but very intuitive and smooth to play.Maybe a learn by playing approach would be more appropriate for new players.In a nutshell: try this heavily underrated gem, you won't regret it.;)

***UPDATE***
Still after many more games I feel this one is getting always better!
One feature I played incorrectly in my first games was the "Grey Eminence" card. It gives more theme to this game and ads intrigue... oh I love it.
I've been playing mainly online on the http://www.mabiweb.com/index.php website, check it out!

***UPDATE***
I'm having AMAZING FUN with this game and it is getting better as I play. If you have the right bunch of people, playing this game will be the most rewarding experience.

***UPDATE***
This is better played f2f. I played again and I did enjoy it a LOT. This game will never let you down, buy this game. ;) 

***UPDATE***
I had to move to an other city and I gave it as a present to my gaming group. That is a game which I first bought 6 years ago, my first "serious" boardgame, in many ways one of my best purchase ever. I hope my gaming group will have a lot of fun with it, in the same way I had fun with it.

Alterations/House rules: Poker chips for VPs.

Agree.

Chris (MULRAH) gave shape to this session in a manner that I hadn't seen before; he threw support to a co-leader and cut both 3rd and 4th place out of the game. This is a game centered mostly on survival while gaining small bits of cooperation.

RATING: 8
After about six plays, I`d say this one really shines. The theme is nice, there are good mechanics, player interaction is properly done, there`s no downtime and when all players have some experience under their belts it really takes only 75-90 minutes, making it easy to actually get playing the game on a very short notice. And it`s relatively inexpensive to acquire. The components do their job well, being informative, but don`t expect anything flashy.

Above all other good things however is the fact that there`s so much going on and so many things to keep track of. There are also many ways to victory and you certainly don`t have to be elected emperor even once to win since kingmaking might pay off handsomely.

Update:
Now that I´ve owned the game for a few years, I have to say that it hasn´t hit the table all that often. The very analytical gameplay seems to turn people off: it´s tiring to play. I´d still say it´s a quality game, though, just not one easily mastered and lightly played.

I liked this game, but for what it was, it was too long and had too many rules.  I'd like to play it again (we got a rule wrong, making the knights stronger than they should have been). 

It has tons of theme for a euro that very easily could have fallen into the "kiss up to the king for VP" trap.  Not sure I like the cards for scoring, since it eliminates the hidden information as you run out of cards and have to make change.  Why not just use smaller 1 point chips or something?  OVerall, a cool game I would definitely play again but not something I would buy.

***Updated from 8 to 6. It feels like this should be a negotiation game yet negotiation is never explicitly defined in the rules, leaving you only with the same type of quid-pro-quo table-talk you could poison any game with.  There are some original mechanisms here, but I've liked this game less every time I've played it.

An area control game, with voting? I wonder if this is Die Macher-Lite? Anyway, an interesting and sophisticated action-card buying, worker (really, baron/couple) placement, area-dominance, buying voting blocs to win victory points game. The aging of the barons/couples is novel, and reminds me the deteriorating health of the characters in Kremlin. There are doctor action cards that groom your barons to stay young and vibrant, while prematurely aging your opponents' barons! Sort of like slowly poisoning your opposition!

You're trying to place barons/couples strategically in a number of voting providences. Majority allows one of the barons/couples to ascend to an office of that providence, that not only gives a vote for who will be emperor, but also a special power they can use once per turn. A lowly knight can be promoted to a baron, who suddenly is married to a foreign princess in a power play, shifted to an another providence to grab majority and the office, and then suddenly be voted to become the Emperor! The game mechanics definitely capture the feel of this ascension, as well as the back-stabbing politics that go with usurping the throne, effectively conveying the medieval theme of the period.

Although it says it can play 3 or 4, it seems lopsided with 3. One player is the Emperor, while the other may be the challenger, while the third player is kingmaker. Somewhat unsatisfying. With four, I can see there can be tension and political intrigue.

It does have a somewhat steep learning curve, however. The first half of the game, I was completely lost, and did not know the value of the offices, nor the importance of securing the throne. With experienced players, this could be very good.

Since this is at heart another influence game I really see it as a more thematic version of El Grande. There's plenty to attract the eye and engage the brain, but the need to 'churn' the electorates in order to get VPs seems counter-intuitive as nothing is awarded for staying in control, while tight scoring and allowing the emperor to decide who rules tied provinces can lead to kingmaking situations.

This is an unusual area control game.  It's pretty difficult to get pieces on the board, and it's really important to win the areas that you go after, as coming in second gets you nothing.  This makes it a pretty tough game in general, and it's easy to get frustrated.  Interesting, however, are the ways in which control can pass from one player to another, and the elections, of which we saw few in our game.  I'd like to give this another try.  (1 play)

RATING: 8
A nice, fairly deep, strategy game. However, the game seems to want to encourage players to switch areas in each of the 4 turns, but with 4 players the limited baron movement cards, immoveable castles and very limited ability to attack other players' barons conspire to keep the board very static - too static for more liking. The comparative emptiness of the board with 3 players allows for greater fluidity so the game works much better.

Not for 2 players (the one starts as an Emperor often wins) but become an excellent game with 3-4.

Emperor has many advantages so directly challenging emperor not a wise choice. If there is an opportunity to gain points by not being an emperor but the power who controls him behind shadow may guarantee the victory.

Truely a brilliant game.

Excellent, deep, easy to learn(not complex) little innovative game that plays well with 3 but would be even better with 4 due to the election (election is the reason I don't think 2 will work as well as the other numbers). Some great concepts here, aging people that will weaken your influence when they die (some can be healed though or opponents killed faster!), getting married is a little one-time alliance of sorts, having children to put on the board. Money and VP's are scarce making for tight decision making throughout, game is very balanced from beginning to end and there is virtually no luck. Multiple paths to victory, I was the Emperor one whole game and lost by 2 points so you see the balance here. Not fiddly at all but slightly prone to AP, not enough to worry about though, games can run a little longer with thinking people is all. The only possible glitch is staying in control gets you "nothing" in a province, this forces you to give one up to someone in order to win one somewhere else(there is one exception or two to this though), possibly 1 VP should of been given to stay in control but more playings will tell for sure, as is a great strategy title...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] more playings confirm this to be a clever, unique and innovative designed game chalked full of tough choices. I'm still having trouble liking the part where if you stay in control of a region you gain NO VP's, this forces you to try and move from one area to another to gain the much needed and hard to come by VP's in the game and it also forces some good interaction.  This is different from most AC games where is staying in control usually gets rewarded, here the incentive is to move out and fight somewhere else and you might even let your own guy in power die (rather than healing him) just to win the region back afterwards.

3 was a good number with a little more control but 4 ensures more competition and a little more uncertainty in the election.  I'm not sure if it was 4 players over 3 but man oh man were actions limited in a GOA kind of way, you want to do so many things but the actions get snapped up pretty fast leaving you less and less optimal choices, this makes being the Emperor a tempting move to not only break ties and get the small reward but to also go first and have first pick of the actions.  

A top Euro game that every Euro fan should try.

I find this to be far too fiddily, which leaves many opportunities to screw up the game by mis-managing aging/moving barons/couples and/or remembering to execute teh elector privilidges that occur out of phase IIII such as the 1 vp or 2 thaler bonus. Further plays may help the rules become second nature and reduce my concerrns, which would raise my rating. It sure feels like there is a meaty game in there but right now our games have ended with a disappointing asterix win because of player errors due to the fiddily rules.

I really liked the theme and mechanics of this game, but only played once so far and that was with just 2 players. My opponent started as emperor and I wasn't able to unseat her once throughout the whole game so I was destroyed. Other people don't seem to have this problem so it must just be me. My rating will probably go up once I convince myself it's not broken.

First play was with all three players being newbies.    I rated it a 5 more because it's the type of game I'll usually rate 5 rather than it being an actual "5" experience.  The negotiations didn't go too badly for me, but if they did, I wouldn't enjoy it at all.  It looks like it would play much different with 4, so maybe I'll try it out that way sometime.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2017)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game, I haven’t heard much about it either, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is the first game I play from designer Ralf Burkert. In the Shadow of the Emperor is a mean control area game and I kind of like it!

The rules aren’t very complex, you can explain them under 16 minutes. Playtime is around 120 minutes. It has a medium weight.

The game´s components are ok and functional, but I really hate how they depict the number “4”, they do it like this “IIII” so I constantly mistook it with the 3 Roman number. I’m not sure why they did this as they use Roman numerals for the other tiles/phases.

The art is from ugly to ok.

The theme is kind of neat and you do feel some of it during the game.

The game´s decisions aren’t obvious and you have to constantly assess your position and guess your opponents intentions, it have lots of tension (a plus). The aging mechanism is very neat and novel, this is the oldest game I have played with it (2004). You can´t turtle because the game encourages you to attack to get VPs and knowing when to go for the emperor title is hard and perhaps you won’t get the support (votes). It seems to have many paths to victory. I love that it doesn’t have any luck whatsoever, a huge plus for me. In the Shadow of the Emperor is mean because it is a tight game and betrayal is not far away.

It is reminiscent of Lancaster, another game I like.

Best with 4 players.

On the bad side, all players need to try their best to win, otherwise it is way too easy to give the game to another player, that is, the game can have kingmaker issues.

Bottom line, Shadow of the Emperor surprised me and I kind of like it. I will keep it in my game collection for now and I need to play it again before deciding if I really like it or if I should sell it. My gut feeling tells me I will love the game with more plays.

More brainburning than it might look.  The mechanism by which regions score points only when they change hands helps avoid the stagnation that a mediocre area-control title might slip into - there's not much incentive to get entrenched.  The theme seems fairly well integrated.

Has a lot of haters though.  Case in point, my wife has decreed we will never own this game, she loathes it so much.  It's because of one bad experience, but I've seen the game evoke similar reactions in others too, and I can't pinpoint why.

Didn't seem too many ways to earn VPs and also seemed to make you focus on churning the provinces you were in control of (i.e. better to take over a new province than defend existing one).  Theme is incorporated well and game is likely to give a close finish between the players.

RATING: 7
An excellent strategy game with a nice twist.  It forces aggresive play by making it the only way to get significant points.  Deep and vicious.  Yum!  After repeated plays, this game seems to have a "drawback" that is becoming more common in recent years.  In an effort to heighten the competition, the scoreing is _so_ tight, that one play by one player at the end can swing everything.  Of course, this is not a flaw in a game where multiple players play superbly, but in the games I've played, it seems nigh impossible for any player to establish any "distance from the pack."  Case in point - I just played a game tonight where there was no question that my play was somewhat lagging behind the other two players.  And I rightfully lost - by two points.  TWO POINTS?  I should _not_ have been one electorate away from winning the game!  Tightness at this level leads to a frustratingly high level of chaos.

RATING: 9
What a ride!  Gets better with every play.  Lots of things to do every turn and lots to think about.  The meager number of victory points to be handed out each round make for tense, close finishes.  Our first 4-player score was 20-16-16-16, the last one was even closer.  HiG/RGG have another hit!  not quite the same level as Louis XIV, but it comes close.  One of my favourites for 2005. A definite '9' rating.

Serious kingmaker issue with 3 players on this game! However, with four players...

This feels both classic and fresh, with mechanics tied to traditional area control and action points (which comes in the form of money - but really only serves to limit the actions you can take on a turn), but with an aging mechanic that times out your game pieces and helps to keep things fluid. Also, you only get points by taking over electorates (the 7 defined control areas of the board), not for holding them, so that also motivates aggressive play. Most turns there is an election and if you are not the emperor or the rival, you need to figure out which to support to best meet your needs. Points are very tight, so seemingly small decisions will make the difference.

The reason this game does not work with three is because the support of the third player will almost always decide the emperor election. If you only try this game with three players, you are doing yourself a disservice. Underrated for sure.

An admiral political area control game with an element of resource conversion in the form of aging, marrying, and moving people up the royal ladder. At this point I like the idea of it but an not sure how much I enjoy it. At the moment I am giving this a 6 but it could go up.

UPDATE: 6.3.12

This game is a solid 6. I respect the design and there aren't any flaws yet I just don't care for the experience. The best part about the game is the aging/placing of aristocrats; it is really cool how they move over space and time. Beyond that, the game doesn't amount to much.

Rating is tentative after one play. Some interesting ideas here, no question (in particular the "aging" of your barons as the time goes on), but the system is so tight and scores so low that I think it may be hard to take satisfaction in a win or care much about a loss. Our spread was 22-28, and that was due to inexperience (actually it was due to players not wanting to admit that they needed to bash the leader. We could easily have taken four points off of his score). I bet it will be half that the next game. Since you often score points 2 at a time, this may lead to feeling like you won because you got in an extra elector somewhere over four turns. Not exactly triumphant. It's too bad too because I think I like several aspects of this game.

You try to have the majority control in various regions to gain special benefits and voting influence to select the emperor. Being the emperor early can generate significant victory points. Other ways to victory points are gaining influence in a new region, or controlling the region that generates victory points.

Initial play didn't really grab me.  The rules were very confusing, but the play is actually not that complicated.

I'm sure there's much more to the game, though I should say that I also think it should be a fairly quick game, A/P kind of impairs my enjoyment here.

RATING: 7
There's huge potential for different strategies and tactics. I should play more to actually understand this. The position of Kaiser is especially strong and I think it is one of the definite ways to success to make the throne shaky when you are not Kaiser and if you end up in that position you should aim at being a strong Kaiser yourself. However it also seems to be important to be ready to let the throne go if you start lacking possibilities on the action phase. This is not playable with 2 players without some house rules because the Kaiser is too strong in that setup. Also of note is the strongly installed theme. The real problem of the game, at least with four players, is that there are seven regions and almost always the situation is such that three players are controlling two regions each while there is a player with just single region. Now this last player starts making efforts to gain the weakliest defended region for himself which allows two players to simply fortify their positions.

you gain influence in several regions mainly through your nobles who age but if you are careful you can use the doctors to keep the geezers alive beyond their time.

Step 1: Gather four board gamers in a telephone booth.
Step 2: Play El Grande.

ITSOTE feels claustrophobic and mean in a way that other area control games somehow don't - players overlap and conflict so quickly that you'd better sharpen your elbows before playing. The actions are incredibly scarce, so you aren't going to be able to shift chits around a whole lot. On one hand you have to plan well in advance before placing new nobles on the board, but that telegraphs your moves, which in turn lessens the likelihood of success. Income is of prime importance, but really hard to obtain.

There's a lot of value in the box. Considering ITSOTE sells for around $20-25 most of the time, buying it is a gimme. The rules are not well written, but it plays smoothly and any rules questions that arise are pretty easily resolved. But the sheer pain of watching provinces slip from your fingers means it won't get played that much. When people smell blood in the water, you're dead. Although on quality alone it's a 9, I have to ding the game a point just because it's such a stressful experience.

After playing this a third time, I feel able to rate this game.  The first time was a bit overwhelming, where we struggled to understand what we were doing.  With the second play I began to grasp the big picture.  By the third game I fully understood what was needed to be done, and how to do it.  The action card system drives the game, and limits the pure negotiation down to the critical vote for Kaiser.  I think this is a clever game, and has nicely fitted mechanics to the theme. Yet, somehow it isn't in the sweet spot for me. I've played it with 3 and 4 players, and I feel the game works better, if longer, with 4 players.  I don't plan on buying this one.

Luckless balanced strategy game with area majority and special action mechanics. The ageing of the barons and the birth of a son or daughter based on the color of the collected special action cards are some of the original & fun elements of this game. Tough choices to decide which special action to take as the supply is limited. Offensive play is required as one of the ways of collecting victory points is by become a prince. Somehow don't succeed to win this game ... although it remains fun and I'll keep on trying.

I love various concepts in this game. Aging rulers, changing hands of power, the fact that the Emperor isn't necessarily the winner, the church versus the nobility... so much going for it.

[Original] This gem is surprisingly unknown in the community, or at least it doesn't seem to generate the same type of buzz that other well-regarded games do. It combines area control with action and resource management; actions are limited in number, hence the need for managing them, while money (or the resources in the form of Thalers) is--like in many games--never quite enough to get "everything" done. Additionally, the mechanism which literally ages each player's aristocrats from one turn to the next ('til death creeps up on 'em) is, without a doubt, the heart of the game. Fret not, based on each players' previous actions, their aristocrats beget either a healthy, young son or daughter. (Nothing quite like grooming the next generation of lords and ladies, eh?) And if all that wasn't enough, each of the game's five turns includes an opportunity to vote for (or against) the current sitting Emperor. Do I detect a little conflict stirring up the status quo?

Go and check this game out, but don't sit in the Emperor's shadow for too long... you may be left out in the cold.

[2007.May.24] Having played this with 2-, 3-, and 4-players, I feel that this game is best played with either 2- or 4-players. With 3-players, the board is simply too open and lacks the same 'constricted' feel that makes the 4-player game so good.

It took me a while to figure out why exactly I didn't like this game despite it having the trappings of solid brainy euros that I like.  Basically, if everyone plays optimally, the main mechanic is a zero sum differential (in aggregate).  This has multiple effects. 1- You need to maintain perfect balance between players, which involve knowing exact scores, which involved memorizing and counting, which add tedium (solution, open scores).  1b- With full scoring information, there's a lot of room for AP.  2- It makes the equilibrium very susceptible to sub-optimal play which will give an unfair advantage to one of the optimal players.  3- It makes final scores very tight which magnifies the impact of fringe points (voting for the victor, being the emperor, using the buy 1 point card, etc.)  Many of these points are finicky affairs dependent near impossible to control factors.  For a brainy euro, this kind of kills.  If I had to play this again, I would like to try a scoring where holding principalities also gives 2 pts, thus breaking the zero sum differential model.  But that's almost an entirely different game.

Tough game, with a lot of jostling for position and bumping of elbows.  A lot of conflict and zero-sum patterns, a good break from these solo-optimization games that dominate the euro market.  

The options on each turn are many, but all are tightly tied to the theme of the game and so they are easy to keep track of.

Can slow down if player's over-analyze the board.  I would prefer to play with a standing agreement not to take longer than 30 seconds on your turn.

RATING: 4
In the days of the Holy Roman Empire, you wanted to be the Emperor but others wanting you down from the throne...to get VPs.  Money can bribe votes.  Territories allegience swings.  You send your daughter away for money or marrying to a hostile or friendly elector family, only to secure the next round of votes for election of the King.  There are quite a number of vairables and people tend to develop in a particular territory after a while.  Gameplay tends to bog down after that when spaces get filled up and there is no incentive to move your influences outside from your stronghold to a strange place.  So the moment tends to be tense for the very first few turns where people are wondering what would be the ultimate path they would like to choose.  The voting part is also not particularly exciting because you would find people voting down the King often in order to gain VPs, although you can also side with the King to get that VP.  The game has a anti-climax effect on me. The card art also is also too childish for my taste.  The internal intricasie are not enough inside the system.  A pass for anyone wanting for more.

This is an underappreciated game that plays best with its full complement of 4 players. It's about intrigue for intrigue's own sake; getting an office is much better than keeping one. There's also a great "birth" thing going on with the cards that causes some tough decisions. http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/212285/underappreciated

Underrated game ! I'd like to play this one more often, the biggest problem is it's really made for 4 players only. The downtime can get a bit high depending on the type of players, but that's highly compensated by the quality of choices you can create.				
I've got a bit of a problem with the advantages the starting player has : he can place everything first + can place an imperial city + goes first in the first round, that's a bit too much, other than that the balance is flawless.

RATING: 6.5
Rating could increase but from a single play with three, the game really seems to need 4 players. Elections have no tension. There is also a balance issue where with three its too easy for two players to compete in some Electorates while the 3rd player has loose reign over others.

Church Influence card may be overpowered for its cost.

RATING: 9
I HIGHLY recommend this game. The rules are fairly simple but PACKED with important and difficult decisions and there are like a million  strategies that could potentially lead to victory. In my opinion the game is highly underrated and should be somewhere up there alongside Puerto Rico or Caylus (especially these two games have a similar "feeling" to them).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating after 2 4-player games. An excellent, subtle area control game with no luck beyond the selection of the starting emperor. Has one of the best balances between strategic and tactical play I've seen in a Euro.can see why many don't think ItSotE would not work with any number than 4, but my suspicion is that it is not so much worse with other numbers as much as the game has a very different character with 2, and yet another different character again with 3. Only experience will show if my hunch is correct, however.

Highly recommended to fans of heavier Euros.

UPDATE: Shaved half a point off because the tightness of action availability can be off-putting. Still highly recommended, and I would still say that it is underrated, but I can't call it a classic.

We aborted a 3 player game mid stream as no one had any understanding of the meaning of any of the decisions we were making; there didn't really seem to be any. We were also having no fun. It's the most convoluted mess I've ever played.

The rule book was a mess, and it took 3 player aids/summaries/sets of clarifications to even get into the game. 

This game was a cardboard travesty. A shame really as this was on the back burner since it's release and was highly anticipated.

A simple area control game where you get points when one of your family become electors in the Holy Roman Empire.  You get a special ability as well. There are both secular and sacred electors.  You then elect the emperor whose powers fall off as time passes.  

This is a classic Euro.  It has the older Euro art from a few years back.  But it is a solid game that has more depth than you may at first see.  

I like the game

Impression after one learning game with many distractions:  What a great game.  Why hadn't I played it before?  ItSotE is a perfect blend of Kremlin and El Grande.  The Holy Roman Empire theme didn't grab me before playing, but after playing I want to read more about it.  I want to play again and hope that it would play closer to the 90 minutes mark as advertised.  That could lift it up a notch in the ratings.

Ótimo jogo, sorte 0. Ponto negativo: apesar de poder jogar com menos, só com 4 ele fica bom, na verdade excelente! Com 2 também dá pra jogar, mas dependendo do início, o primeiro jogador tem uma leve vantagem, principalmente se conseguir ser o Imperador na primeira e manter a posição na rodada seguinte (o que não é muito difícil). O jogo perde muito com 3 players.

This game somehow reminds me of Blood Royale. It must be this dynasty building element. But that's about all they have
in common, since its rules are brief and clear and it can be played in about 90 min. It is cleverly designed has a strong theme for a german game and gives you a load of non-trivial decisions to make. This is the way I like it.

No luck or random elements (except choosing the starting player). There are a lot of interesting decisions (limited resources to be bought and limited "gold", i.e. action points, to buy them) and quite a bit of diplomacy as well. Some clever ideas (ageing characters, weddings, children being male or female if you've bought more "blue" or "pink" actions in the previous round, etc.). Best with 4.

I really enjoyed this game.  Great mechanics I thought.  Simple at points, but extremely strategic.  Not quite a 10 in my book, but I hope to break this one out again soon!  I wonder if a 5 player version of this would have worked with 9 electorates?  Definitely worth the low price of this game (less than 20 bucks at some places).  Great theme as well and it seems to have been playtested very well.  Great job RGG and Ralf.

Influence game with multiple layers and some nice twists. First couple of games take long, hope to get the playing time down with experience.
I've now played three times, and I still don't have a grip on the strategy although I seem to be improving. Although there is no random factor in the game, there is a lot of chaos as a sub-optimal or weird move by an opponent can really hurt your chances - an aspect I dislike in a game.
We can't seem to bring the playing time down for this game, and my appetite for games with a lot of little rules has gone down significantly. Banned to the attic.

RATING: 6.9
Tras el primer juego entre 2, me gusta la inexistencia del factor suerte; las distintas vías para obtener puntos de victoria. Algo para chequear con más juegos y más jugadores: lo determinante de ser emperador.
UPdate: Escala a 9,1, tras simplemente leeer nuevamente las reglas y percatarme de todas las posibilidades que tiene.
las ya verificadas:
-No suerte.
-No tiempo muerto
-No solitarios paralelos: mucha interacción, no en cuanto a negociación, sino que lo que hace uno afecta INMEDIATAMENTE a los demás
-Muchas vías al éxito
UPDATE: sube de 9 a 10. Es muy buen juego, pese a que lo he jugado solo de a dos. Y dicen que con 4 es excelente.
UPDATE: primer juego de a tres: excelente..terminamos 20, 19 y 18 PV. Claro que duró 3 horas. Pero muy relajadamente...cmo un ajedrez, sin apurar al otro. Mientras piensa su jugada (le decíamos, su momento de análisis-parálisis), los demás miran TV, se preparan algo para comer, un cafecito, o simlpemente analizan su estrategia, etc.; en fin, el tiempo pasa rápido.
UPDATE: con 4 jugadores, es más difícil controlar lo que sucede. Creo que es conveniente permitir la negociación con miras a la Elección del Emperador.
24 MAYO 2005: hemos implementado que se remata el cargo de Emperador al inicio: usando las fichas de aristócratas, cada jugador escoge cuantos talentos u oros appostará. Se abren las manos simultáneamente. el que gana decide quién es el emperador; en caso de empate, se va a una segunda vuelta entre los empatados; de persistir, se sortea.
CONCLUSIÓN: el aportar por ser Emperador ya es parte de la estrategia de cada uno (es Emperador, pero parte con menos dinero), y no es por suerte o por amistades previas entre los jugadores.
UPDATE SEPTIEMBRE 2005: Baja de 10, a 9,5 porque creo que ser emperador sigue teniendo ventajas, especialmente si nadie lo desafía a él. En un juego, no me atreví a desafiarlo, porque yo estimaba que no tendría apoyo de otros jugadores, porque tengo la impresión de que creen que yo soy más peligroso como Emperador.  
Por este motivo, el que era Emperador la tuvo muy fácil. al final obtuvo 26 puntos, contra 19 de su más cercano perseguidor.  
Creo que tampoco es solución permitir la diplomacia, porque se modifica la pureza del juego y se puede transformar en un juego un tanto ácido, especialmente para las mujeres
ENGLISH:
After the first game between 2, I like the nonexistence of the factor luck; the different roads to obtain points of victory. Something to observe with more games and more players: the decisive thing of being an Emperor.  
UPdate: It ascends at 9.1, after simply to read again the rules and to notice of all the possibilities that it has.  
Those already verified:  
-no luck factor
-no downtime  
-no solitary: a lot of interaction, not as for negotiation, but rather that makes one it affects IMMEDIATELY to the other ones  
-many roads to the success  
UPDATE: it ascends from 9 to 10. It is very good game, in spite of the fact that I have played it only at two. And some people say that with 4 it is excellent.  
UPDATE: first game with three players: excellent...when concluding the result was 20, 19 and 18 PV. But it lasted 3 hours. But very relaxed ...like a chess, without hurrying to the other one. While one player thinks their play the other ones they look at TV, they get ready something to eat, a café, or they simply analyze their strategy, etc.; in short, the time passes quick.  
UPDATE: with 4 players, it is more difficult to control what happens. I believe that it is convenient to allow the negotiation before the Emperor's Election.  
24 MAY 2005: we have implemented how to chose the Emperor at the beginning: using the tokens of aristocrats, each player chooses how many talents or gold will bet. The hands open up simultaneously. the one that wins decides who the emperor is; in the event of tie, there will be a second turn among those tied; of persisting, it is drawn.  
CONCLUSION: contributing to be an Emperor is already part of the strategy of each one (he/she is an Emperor, but starts with less money), and it is not for luck or for previous friendships among the players.
SEPT. 05 UPDATE: From 10 to 9.5 because I believe that to be an Emperor continues having advantages, especially if nobody challenges him. In a game, I didn't dare to challenge him, because I estimated that I would not have other players' support, because I have the impression that they believe that I am more dangerous as Emperor.  
For this reason, the one that was an Emperor had it very easy. at the end he obtained 26 points, against my 19.  
I believe that neither it is solution to allow the diplomacy, because it modifies the purity of the game and a so much acid can become a game, especially for the women.

Way too much going on in this game for my tastes.  It does have very interesting game mechanics (aging player tokens, the boy/girl birthing based on which actions were taken by the player), but there are so many decisions to make and no randomness to keep the game exciting.  I'm usually bored by the end, and it doesn't help that there's no tiebreaker.  After a 2+ hour game, we once had 3 of the 4 players with the exact same score.  Not exactly satisfying.

A few Plays.

It took us waaay too long to play this the first time. We struggled with the rules and play for a while.

After a few plays I like the game. It has several interesting mechanisms (aging, descendants, the elections etc. The basic point earner is to get elected in various areas to earn 2 vp. This is easier said than done and a lot of the game revolves around trying to get as many aristocrats elected per turn as possible, w/o spreading yourself to thin. To this end there is a lot of waiting attemps while taking actions to see who is going where. There are also a lot of limited actions that you need to jump on and this really makes for some tough choices.

This appears to be an under rated game. When played reasonably fast it is a great little game!

I liked parts of this game, nonplussed by others.  There were quite a few choices to make, and one always seemed one coin short.  Pretty good interplay and fairly balanced positions.  I really did not like the birth mechanism, where one could dictate if one got a boy or girl- that's TOO much control for me.  On the fence as to whether I need this for my own collection.  On one hand a good game, on the other, I have silimar things and I have the sneaking suspicion that all these maneuverings are more smoke than fire, but maybe another try is in order.

Middle-weight voting / negotiation game (that I'd enjoy most with a negotiation light group).  There are some roles and area control (majorities).   It's good to be The King but tough to keep the throne.  
03-2007 UPDATE: Moved ranking down: I think this is a well-themed fantastic design but I find the negotiation aspect to be frustrating.  I usually don't like games where it's better to be in second place so everybody doesn't attack you.
09-2012 UPDATE: Moving ranking down 1/2pt.  Just really dislike when this comes out.  I'd rate it much lower but I love the design.

It's finally happened: This old favorite of mine has toppled from its throne. (I used to rate it a 9!) I'm finding games to be predictable, generally following the same arc everytime. As long as I don't make a mistake, I'll win or tie for 1st. In addition, this is one of those games that's fairly streamlined in play but very difficult to explain, going through the plethora of card actions and special powers by region.

Playing this game well requires a delicate balance, knowing when to make your big move and knowing how hard to push. The perfect information allows for predicting others' moves for most of the current turn, so you can carefully craft your own short-term strategy and capitalize on others' mistakes. I disagree that Mainz is overpowered, but definitely don't let one player have it the whole game. Others will say going first is "broken," as you'll always win. Also false. 

In my opinion, the most advantageous position is starting 2nd. Early on, you quietly collude with the Emperor to crush the other two players. In a game typically decided by just 1 or 2 VPs, passing up the Rival action and then voting against the player who foolishly takes it instead is huge (assuming the Emperor himself has got his act together and can win the election with your vote). Mid-game, make your stand to become the Emperor. You yourself should be losing, so the other players will have no choice but to oust the current leader and move themselves up in turn order. Use your time as Emperor wisely, going for a double Ascension, possibly locking down the Emperorship for the rest of the game with a Knight-filled Koln. Skipping an election is awesome: +1 VP for you. Grab those Indulgences. By the end of the game, you should edge the former Emperor, who can do nothing at 4th in the turn order. Even if someone ousts you in the final turn, it's not a big deal, as the Emperor's advantages decline as the game goes on.

(In short, this is a worker placement game where there's no "action" to grab going 1st, typically a significant advantage in these sorts of games. The player who starts out going 2nd has an opportunity to go 1st or 2nd for the entire game, which is essentially game-winning if you pull it off.)

In the Shadow of the Emperor was essentially my "gateway" to heavier Euro games, so I'll never rate it lower than this, even though my interest in playing it is pretty limited these days. It feels like I've been playing it forever, but was surprised to find it wearing thin after "only" 16 plays. Compared to a lot of other games, that's huge, but compared to my new favorites--Tigris & Euphrates and Brass--it's surprisingly low.

A bit complicated to wrap your head around, but by about halfway through the game, I grasped the idea. Tied for the win despite never being elected Emperor. Area control + aging.

Just splendid!
This is an excellent game of courtly intrigue and power play, and, despite its slightly abstract appearance, it's just oozing with theme. Aging, marriages and papal (dis)favour should be part of every game featuring European royalty, but never have I seen them implemented this gracefully – if at all. The lack of overt conflict, while surprising at first, turns out to be a design masterstroke.
There's a touch of 'Louis XIV' in the jostling for supremacy in key electorates, and the orchestrating of a coup reminds me of 'Wallenstein' – and that's high praise coming from me. Actually, the lack of any random features makes 'In the Shadow of the Emperor' a sort of first among equals in my 'nine' category, and should 'Age of Steam' ever fall from grace, this is a serious contender for the throne. Gripping stuff!

A person is emperor. There are 7 other areas, where players vie for majority to gain special bonuses. Players put on nobles (single or married), knights, and cities. Each person has a set income which they spend to buy actions, each player executing an action one at a time. There are a limited number of action cards. For instance, each round there are only three cards to allow one to buy cities. Nobles age each round as well, which makes it a neat mechansim. They age from 15-25-35-45 and pass away after 45. Single nobles can get married off, and daughters are generated depending on the mix of action cards that you buy. Game last 5 rounds. Played once with four players. Pretty decent game, but it did take a bit long at two and a half hours. There are lots of things to think about while moving pieces around to secure majorities and special bonuses.

Lots of iconography to get used to.  I didnt really get the understanding of the game until I saw what an experienced player chose for moves.  The game ended by that time.  Need more plays.  Trying to find the balance in political power in this game was a bit ruthless.  I think the game was fine with 4, but it seemed somewhat chaotic.  Money seemed to be very valuable and essential to getting everything done effectively.  

Only real issue was the upkeep on all the moving parts of the game.  Mainly the aging.

Three plays so far.  A very impressive game, which gets better with repeated plays with other experienced players.  There's so much to track in this one, that until you learn to quickly recognise everything that's going on it seems a bit overwhelming ([i]Die Haendler[/i] gives a similar feeling).  Scoring in this game is always really tight -- this is a very well balanced and playtested design.  I expect my rating to go to 9 or so with repeated plays.

You really [i]do[/i] need to give this game a chance to shine -- don't judge it after only a single play!  There is serious fun to be had with this game, but until you're playing in a game where everyone has some prior experience, you may not find it.  Rules explanation can be lengthy and tedious, due to the many possible actions that need to be explained, so playing as or with newbies is much less fun.  A serious "gamers" game.

Big complexity in a smaller-side-of-medium package.  Considerably more "do unto others before they do unto you" than many German games , and no randomness aside from seating order and mental coin-flipping.  Players who prefer to jump into games and learn as they go should be kept far, far away from this one;  with only five rounds per game, everything you do matters.  My gripes:  The English rulebook leaves a lot to be desired, and starting as the Emperor sucks.

There were a few quirky odd things about this game that I wonder if we played a bit wrong, but the game as a whole was a lot of fun.  I really like the aging mechanic of the game.  The game is a focus more on the dynasty of your royal family more so than anything else.  Very unique in that respect.

Update.  Played again.  Rating went up.  There's a lot to like here.  Some chaos, but it gets more predictable as the round goes on, rather than less.  That's a good thing, as you get more control when it counts.  There's also quite a bit of reading the flow of the game and that too is fun.  The dynamicism that the game promotes keeps things from bogging down.  It's also about the perfect length for what it offers, and that's never a bad thing.

I like the theme. The double-layered voting system is interesting. The rules are simple enough, it works with children (my daughter particularly likes the princess-wedding system) and is a good initiation to more complex political games. At the same time, gameplay is very deep tactically (not unlike chess for the tactical combinations) but there is also some strategy when you decide where to push this turn, and sometimes for the next, and when to try and grab the throne, but it seems to me that you can't really plan for the long term. Being Kaiser is nice but not all-powerful and can prove costly when you have to buy all those Church cards. 

Even if you play without negotiation (which you probably should do) there is an interesting element of diplomacy in deciding who you favor (as the Emperor) and who you vote for. Not sure how it works with less than 4 players, though. 

The play-balance bias in favor of the initial Emperor (who is more likely to win according to statistics from Mabiweb) disappears among experienced players.

RATING: 9
What a hidden gem! No luck factor game with an amazing feel of politics. The number of a players' nobles in different provinces and other of the players' tokens determine who will rule the given province and get victory points as well as a chance to use each provinces benefits. The person with the highest number of rulers of provinces has a higest chance to become the new emperor. All players vote and get benefits from siding with one candidate or the other. The climate of the game is amazing and I highly recommend this game!

On a first play I'd have to rate this abstruse, plodding, rulesy game poorly. The rule book tells a fascinating tale of rulers reaching old age at 45, spurned noble daughters becoming devout and joining convents, the eminence of the gray, but the gameplay itself is a slog, revolves around opponents' kingmaking actions, and in the end, victory went to a player who didn't seem to be doing anything in the theme of the game (such as vying for emperor, increasing income, building cities) but rather sat back eking out a victory point here and there each round. (That player was me.)

This game misses being perfect by only a small margin.  Unfortunately, though the problem is just with some of the rules and wordings, they make the game a totally different beast than what I beleive was intended.  Got a problem with the king?  Oh, that's easy, just age him to death!  That tactic, I believe was never intended, but because of some inaccuracies with the rules, it's allowed.  This game should have been the successor to Kremlin, but unfortunately without some reworking of the rules it is limited in its strategy, and therefore not as good of a game.

I've only played this with two players and it is totally unbalanced. However, it's a really intersting system and I'm sure it would be good with more players. I expect my rating to rise once played with more players. Update: Apparently we played it wrong - so take this rating with a pinch of salt.

Lots of fiddly rules. The game is yet another area majority game. Each area offers different rewards. Your markers continually age and you have to work out a replenishment plan. I guess that's the new thing that might excite people. For me, it's yet another game where the winner is the person who gets competed with least and therefore has most markers free to attack the next targetted area. Fortress an area or 2 of yours so they're not worth attacking to the others, move 'em out and steal another area. Concentrate on victory points (duh!) rather than area control for the sake of it by aging off your leaders and replacing them,
voting for the right emperor and continually attacking new areas. One strategy seems to be to fortress up the "VP each turn" area if at all possible from the start so no one else bothers going there, then range out.

I've no need to play again as there seems little else to explore and it doesn't bring much fun to the table, nor encourage it through the game play. Decent a design as it is.

Un gioco tedesco da manuale: senza dadi, con regole semplici, durata breve e punti vittoria; uno di quelli dove tutti gli errori dipendono da te e non dal caso. le meccaniche di gioco sono semplici (e dopo decine di giochi americani non manca affatto il tipico ricorso al manuale per l'enorme quantità di regole e eccezioni), le azioni a disposizione chiarissime così come i poteri dei sette elettori. Ben sviluppate le dinamiche dei nobili (i single che regnano sulle province papali e gli accoppiati, la ruota delle età, la determinazione del sesso dell'erede che dipende dalle azioni). A prima vista, un giocatore con più esperienza nel gioco ha più possibilità di vincere. Come unico difetto trovo che, in fase di elezione dell'imperatore, i due candidati abbiano pochi mezzi, se non le chiacchere, per portare a se' i voti delle famiglie non direttamente coinvolte nell'elezione. Forse la possibilità di usare i soldi aiuterebbe (ma probabilmente sciuperebbe quel delizioso meccanismo a orologeria che è il sistema di gioco).

This has become my most-played game online (mabiweb), displacing Amun-Re. It is a very deep and complex game, and it needs exactly four to play right.  Once you internalize the rules, it all fits together like a delightful little clock, with multiple gears and sub-mechanisms. There is a lot of game here, and it can be had for a good price. There are strategic paths and tactical wrinkles to be discovered. 

My system: I try to dominate Mainz.  And I scheme to become, and remain, emperor.  If I am late in turn order and another player has grabbed Mainz, it is much harder to win.

I've downgraded this from an 8 to 7. The problem is that Mainz is over-powered.  If you are early in turn order it is easy to grab Mainz and win. Late turn order?  Hope the player who has Mainz screws up. [sold]

Great election game that's really more about the process than the results.  The game seems very fluid as becoming an elector is much more important than staying one.  The aging mechanic adds another layer of depth.  While the game does fit together nicely, strategies aren't immediately intuitive, and often it's difficult to figure out what to try for.

Too many rules of the form "give one point/coin/card to the player who has the most this-or-that nearest something else" which could have been listed on a rules summary card, but weren't.

Rating based on one play.  I'm still on the fence after the first play, my rating could go up or down.  This is clearly a Eurogame, but the mechanics are much more integrated into the theme than a typical Euro.  The only exception is the fact that you don't earn victory points for holding onto electors, only for when they change hands.  Doesn't make sense from a political perspective, but it certainly does make for interesting game strategy.  There was very little negotiation or politicking in our game as we felt is was against the spirit of the game.  As a result the game was fairly dry.  Not sure if others get a lot more interactive, but it could really liven things up ("I won't contest you in Mainz next turn if you vote for the Rival now" etc.).  In summary, there's a lot going on in this game so strategy is not obvious on first play, but there's a lot to like.

Cool area control game with a few really neat twists and some extra complications. The most interesting change from the typical area control formula is that no points are awarded for holding an area, only for gaining control. I really like the need to constantly plan ahead for where to move your influence and the tension of having limited actions with which to do so. Another nice twist, which complements the first, is how aging leaders causes support to decay over time. There are some fiddly things, particularly with respect to the emperor's position, that I'm not sure really have much payoff, but I enjoyed the game nonetheless.

Really interesting area control game -- you are trying to control an electorate, to give you votes for who will become emperor (and pick up victory points besides.) The game is full of decisions and is very tight-- probably one of my favorite area control games thus far.

RATING: 8
A very fine game that I have begun to grasp after a couple plays.  Early mistakes can really help someone to excellence, but clever play always wins.  Incredibly opaque and unintuitive.  Not a very dynamic game - change is slow and deliberate and tense, and early mistakes can really haunt you.  Hard to get the leader as it tends to take a concerted effort...but you're rarely 100% sure who's in the lead.  Brain burner.  Don't plan on too many this heavy in one night...

Probably my favorite game of Essen, but not by much.  This game has a lot of potential, we only started to see the strategies towards the last couple rounds.  Steep learning curve, don't get discouraged until we played it one time through.  I really enjoyed the unique people simulator mechanics/theme in the game.  You have nobles, they can get married, they can have kids.  If you have a girl, she can get married to another single male on the board (not your own noble).  They can progressively get older and eventually die.  They can become lords, bishops, even the king and queen.  Each round, the players vote on a new King, I really enjoyed this voting mechanic but it's kinda broken with 3-players.  This IMO is a 4-player-only game.  Rating holds strong after 3 plays.

RATING: 5
The mechanics and gameplay effectively provoke a narrative of royal shenanigans such as giving away daughters, poisoning nobles and unseating the emperor/kaiser, with some bookkeeping to maintain the atmosphere. Other players may find the various ways of acquiring vps and special princely abilities (and how to best use them) more intriguing. For me this was an obstacle: that an overwhelming amount of avenues of progress and possibilities had to be assimilated and then worked out before I could start focussing on tactics, a situation for some downtime. (I much prefer game designs where options are more visually understood and vps are gained more directly, so hopefully more pacey play). Added to this is the possibility that all your hard planning can easily be undone by a player's action. Sure it may be thematic politics, but it can leave a nasty taste after all that mental expenditure. Compared to the recently atmospheric Lost Valley, this playing unfortunately casted a cold shadow, being not that fun nor that tense for me.

This is an extremely interesting game that features a ton of player interaction. The idea is you place your people tiles into the different regions by taking actions represented by blue and pink cards. Each round you age all your worker tiles by turning them 90 degrees to the right, and eventually they die off. You also have a baby, which is a boy or a girl depending on which color cards you took more of. A boy becomes a new worker for you, but a girl needs to be married off to another player, or sold to the convent for an extra dollar that turn. The game also has elections for the next emperor where players who have the majority of influence in each region cast votes for the two players in contention. This is all wonderful, but actual points come mostly from taking over other player's spots with your influence, so the game rewards players moving around the board effectively. Each city also has a special ability for the majority holder in it's spot. The two problems with the game are just that this game only works with exactly 4 players, and the look of the graphic design is very dated. Otherwise fantastic.

In the Shadow of the Emperor feels like one of those transitional Euros like Princes of Florence. There's still some interaction (area majority, voting and even some direct attacks) but you can feel the inflexibility of strategic pathways setting in. I won 26-24-23-18 and I can't see the point spread ever being more than that, given the scarcity of VP opportunities. Lots of 'clever' mechanics to admire but oh-so-dry.

One 4-player game. Rulebook is very bad and makes a fairly simple sequence of play seem excessively complicated. Many of the 'activities' feel like tacked-on subroutines that detract from the expected elegance in Euro-design. Play devolved into static ownership of areas, there was too much money for the few cards available for purchase, Emperor elections were forgone conclusions in most cases, and VP acquisitions involved some non-intuitive actions. A perfect information game that first felt like chaos then progressed to gridlock. I'll give it one more try to see if even a 6 rating holds up.

Update: This is staying at 3.

I finally played a whole game of this with players who appreciate Eurogames.

Same comments apply except that the election part is quite amusing. It's like the prisoner's dilemma as you try to guess who'll become Emperor to score points.

There is some opportunity for long-term strategy since the opportunities to add or move influence markers is limited. Thus you should plan several turns in advance which areas to control.

The aging mechanic is more interesting than I thought previously, but not much so.

But despite this, it's still yet another soulless worker-placement Euro.

===========================


I really wanted to like this game. The fact that you score for taking over an area rather than maintaining control over an area is fascinating, and I like the fact that your pieces aged through the game.

However, this is a worker placement game before Caylus and Pillars of the Earth, and this one pales in comparison with these two. (It doesn't help that I despise worker placement games.)

As with worker placement games, you have a free choice of a multitude of actions, all of them available only in limited numbers. However, the big difference here is that you have to pay for these actions, so the number of choices you actually have dwindles dramatically.

In your typical worker placement game, the amount of points you accumulate generally increases throughout the duration of the game; these games typically demand that players build an economic engine as quickly as possible or accomplish some long term goal. In this game, you pick up 1-2 points here and there. There's basically no drama in the game, so it feels very repetitive from round to round. What's worse, your pieces don't age that fast, so the board is actually more static than what the rules suggest.

There's an election almost each round for the emperor, who gets certain special powers and some victory points. This would have been a perfect opportunity to introduce some negotiation into the game, but the game's mechanics can't even handle that ... there's nothing that those running for power can offer the other players. So what seems to end up happening that players vote for the player who's most in behind ... an opportunity for intrigue in the game squandered.

It's always hard to fairly rate a game after only one play. That being said, I don't think this will be a game I will get into. But that is mostly because I can tell it will take me several plays to get used to what everything does.

* UPDATE *

I've had a chance to play this again a couple of more times, but declined each time. I just can't get mayself to give it another shot. It's not really a bad game, it's just not for me.

RATING: 7
Complex yet straight-forward rules lead to almost chaotic player interaction in which the best path among the hundreds of possibilities always available in a round (unless taken by an opponent) is far from clear.  This game is on a complexity level similar to Caylus or Goa, yet more difficult to analyze and predict due to the greater 'jostling for position' action between players.  I managed to remain Emperor until the last turn, yet shared the win with someone who had never been Emperor at all.  One thing I found somewhat frustrating during the game was the difficulty of wresting an area from another player's control - ever.  We seemed to all be locked into the positions we had chosen in the first round, with few changes for the rest of the game, and it is only that aspect of it that reduces my rating below that of Caylus or Goa.  Perhaps with more plays, I'll see a strategy that fixes this, and revise my rating.

An area control game with some true innovations, e.g.: VPs are awarded only for supplanting a majority leader, not retaining control, of an electorate; characters on the board "age" each turn (so unless treated by a doctor, they will "retire" after four rounds); and each action card played is either blue or pink, and at the end of a round you will give birth to a boy (introduce an age 15 noble to the board) or girl (upgrade a noble to a couple, or take a VP), depending on whether you played more blue or pink cards. Money is used as a sort of action point system (topping off at 12 per player), with actions ranging from placing and moving your nobles and knights to building cities, altering the voting conditions for an upcoming election, or simply takng VPs. The Rival action card results in an election vs. the current Emperor, with the winner gaining various benefits, such as tiebreaker rights and VPs. This game appears to have suffered from its small box production and dull cover art (which even its low price point couldn't fix), as it is more than just another re-hash.

Remarkably subtle design which hews to its theme better than most euros. It's blend of tactics, strategy, and theme hangs together well. And it's truly nasty - a plus in my books.

Gets a preliminary 6.  Very difficult to get the swing of things due to rather convoluted rules.  A lot to absorb your first game.  Although it states it can be played with two (which I did), it seems like you really need 4 to get the real flavor.  Maybe rating will go up with more players.  UPDATE: played with 3 and it is MUCH better.  The voting is of course more fun as is the table-talk.  I think that this could be the eurogamer's answer to Diplomacy.  There is some backstabbing and negotiating for votes, but it is playable in a short period of time and has lots of interesting, if not confusing, mechanics.

RATING: 7
Based on one play.  I really like the game, and will like it more if it plays faster the 2nd time around. unlike a lot of these german games, this one has a lot of my favorite thing--player interaction. pretty much every move you make is about scrambling over somebody else to improve your position. It seems, from the rules, like it might be a *very* nasty game--voting politics, marrying off daughters for political gain, killing off enemies--but it's been sanitized enough so that those kinds of moves are only a *little* nasty, and there's no need to lie, backstab, or anything that's at all ethically questionable.

from a more mechanical perspective, there are some good tradeoffs to consider--trying to usurp the emperor vs. doing actual work, choosing which battles to fight (area majority). There's an action phase where the actions you take are chosen under not one, not two, but three constraints: time, money, and ability to produce sexed progeny.  There's a lot of tactical creativity possible, utilizing the fact that people age as the game progresses, that resources can be moved around, that strife can be produced between opponents, that the influence of the emperor can be to your benefit, even if you are not directly in control of the position.    

Theme is great, as should be obvious from my short review.  

On the minus side, the main meal of the game is an "action phase", during which people choose one of 10 or so actions to perform.   The game really bogged down as people considered each option!  Our game took about 2 1/2 hours as a result, and I sincerely hope future games will be much faster (I have reason to believe that they will--maybe we can get it down to 90 mins).  

skills used in the game: choosing between benefits of very different qualities, creative placement of resources, outguessing your opponent, budgeting, brinksmanship.

one piece of advice: be careful when you say anything to the effect of "Oh good, I get a 15-year old boy."

It's 7 area control games in one as players vie for control of areas to elect an emperor.

Fantastically complex interaction (but with fairly straightforward rules) as you take the role of a powerplayer in the struggle to control the destiny of the Holy Roman Empire.

If you think a Euro with a lot of interaction, conflict, and diplomacy** sounds like fun, then you owe it to yourself to at least try this one. Just DO NOT play with any player count besides 4. Don't be fooled by the box. This game ONLY plays 4.

I want to add a more detailed description later. There is so much going on in this game that is unlike what I've experienced in many other games.

Plays best with four players and I'll only play it with that number. A majority control region game where the victory points are primarily awarded through turning over the control of the different regions. The limited supply of cards provides some good choices. Rules are well set out and reasonably clear - although I did have to refer to the FAQ. Many different paths to victory and small mistakes can cost you with the winning victory point total being quite low. I think I'm going to enjoy this one for a long time.

An interesting take on the area control mechanic with little, if any, luck involved.  Very original idea, superb theme and terrific components.  Huge learning curve though.  Difficult to "get" from the rulebook; it becomes clear after a couple of playings.  Meant for 4 players, I think.  Ultimately, though, it's not all that much fun.  But, there's no arguing that it's a solid game

Fluid political game.  Brings to mind Puerto Rico and the recent Martin Wallace oeuvre (PotR, SoE) with the "disappearing menu of choices".  Scoring points for taking control but not maintaining control increases the volatility.  Perhaps a little lopsided with two, enjoyable with three, simply awesome with four.  And Doktor Glaze, you are high on chocolate frosting if you think this game takes 4-5 hours... 120 minutes, tops!

Played once, liked it. I'd like to play again.
Now I've played another game (online). I like this game. I think it's a great game for PBW. Maybe a bit too physically fiddley for F2F gaming though. Best with 4 players, less good with 3.

Edit: I've played a lot of online games on MaBiWeb now, and this is an excellent, excellent game. highly recommended.

A rather excellent Eurogame on a less well-worn theme, which it manages to model quite well. (A game which exposed my ignorance of the history concerned and sent me to the books to find out more). VERY playable - very enjoyable

RATING: 6
A vanilla majority game but with twists coming from the powerful Emperor, aging and myriad special powers and actions. 

The voting for Emperor is interesting and creates a lot of prisoner's-dilemma situations. The disappointment is the voting result is often obvious and not in doubt. The aging mechanism is cool and fits very well in a majority game, and my only wish is there were fewer steps, so the aging becomes more important. As it is right now, your young Baron/Couple placed in Round 1 can last through four-fifths of the game.

The multitude of action choices and elector privileges make learning this game like learning a new language. It's worth it in Brass and In the Year of the Dragon but just okay here, since it feels like complexity for complexity's sake. It doesn't change my biggest gripe about the gameplay of vanilla majority games like this: place one piece at a time and project till the end who has to give up first and go into another arena.

God the components are hideous. Save my eyes from those nasty pastel colors! The Baron/Couple are hideous; why not just make them as normal tiles with small numbers printed on the edge, just like in Columbia block wargames? Instead of this ugly lines-converging-on-the-tiny-picture-in-middle thing.

3+3

Very unique mechanics, really sets itself apart from the area-influence archetype. I think the thing I like most about this game is that it is the only game involving nobility where there is no intrigue or subterfuge. Your electors are appointed legally, and are either voted out of office by their constituents or die of old age! Still not sure if this one is worth the time investment. The turns really seem to drag.

Played this again and really liked it much more! Having a basic grasp of the ebb and flow of the nature of the game allowed me to have a lot more fun with it and be more competitive. I'm now wondering if this game is prone to ties however...

[3 plays] 3 player games and a 4 player game. Very interesting mechanics and tons of choices. A lot to digest. This is a beautiful and clever game that definitely engages my brain. I'm just not sure yet if I think it is a _fun_ game. Hopefully a couple more plays will clarify that for me.

Most recent play 1-03-07 with Michael and Alex on MaBiWeb.

Update: 8-08   This feels like an intellectual exercise. While it is interesting, it just isn't great amounts of fun, and the kingmaking aspect can be a drainer at the end.

RATING: 6.5
Expect to take longer than 90 mins the first time you play.

Set in the middle ages, players take on roles of would be emperors. In the process of the game, they try to gain influence as the elector of various districts.

Money is used to pick card actions that determine what players can do (place a new baron, place kings, build cities, move pieces, etc) all in a bid to gain VPs.

It feels a little too long for what you get. Ultimately, the game has alot of potential for screwing the leader and you get little payoff for the amount of time spent playing the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After one play, too fiddly and a bit long. Some cool ideas and definitely new things. Feels like an odd cross between a Euro and a 80's-style Exception Machine (a game with too many cards that break rules and allow you to do various actions that are too long to recall easily). Like Blood Royale and Goa had a baby. Some interesting choices but I am not sure this is a keeper.

My favorite "political" board game. I like the variety of ways to get points, the way the voting works, and the innovative rules for aging and having descendants. The fact that you get points for taking over areas rather than holding them makes for a lively game. You need four players though.

Area Influence, Action Selection. Solid Euro design that implements the theme well. We underused the Rival card -- looking forward to more plays with more voting.

I keep flipflopping on owning this one. I really do like it, but nobody else is interested in playing it. So I got rid of it. Then regret it and get it again. Then got rid of it again. Sigh.

RATING: 7.274
The game had a lot of interesting features and numerous options.  The strangest one was that the played pink and blue event cards determined the sex of your family's children each turn.  Man, that's the weirdest thing since, I don't know, Reef Encounter maybe.  (I wonder if any card-driven wargames tally up color-coded cards in a similar mechanism.)  The use of "doctors" to age or reverse the aging of characters is another interesting feature.  The game seemed to be a bit long at maybe two and a half hours, but I think that was partly just the learning process as I didn't seem to get bored with the game.  I tend to think that this game would only play well with four players, but perhaps I am wrong.  You can play it for free at www.mabiweb.com.

A nem fiatal játék nagyon sok egyedi mechanizmust tartalmaz. Középkori nemesekként 7 tartományban küzdenek a játékosok a választói hatalomért, hogy jogukat gyakorolva császárrá válhassanak. A pénz egyszerű megoldása, a nemesek öregedése, a születés és házasság mind-mind nagyon jó megvalósított elem a társasban. A tábla ugyan nem szép, de tökéletesen megfelel a játéknak, ugyanis egy kimondott gamer's game-ről beszélünk. Kezdőknek egyáltalán nem ajánlható konfrontatív játék, amiben a sok lehetőségből a legoptimálisabbat kiválasztani nem egyszerű feladat. A játék negatívuma, hogy talán csak négyen igazán jó a császárválasztási rész miatt, illetve ugyanolyan szinten ismerőkkel jó jásztani. Mindenkinek mindenkire figyelnie kell, mert ha az éppen vezető ellen nem fognak össze, könnyedén megtarthatja a császári hatalmat és ezzel a játék győztesévé válhat.

[2012-03-24]
Második játékra kiderült nem feltétlenül nyerő a császári hatalom, lehet kerülőúton is nyerni. Igazából vannak zavaró elemek a játékban, amiért nem tudok pontot emelni.

What a fantastic system.  There is a ton of stuff going on here, but I feel it all works in its simplest form.  There really is no clutter.  The game feels nicely balanced, with none of the paths to victory outweighing the others (and there are a number of paths).  Great theme, rich in color.  This game forces aggressive play.  In games like El Grande you have a tendency to camp, this game pushes you to take new areas constantly as you only get points when you succeed a title.  Tough to decide when to go for Emperor.  Overall just quite lovely.

BTW, despite what the box says this is only a four player game.

Great game but might be to complex for families. Sad thing is that in a three player game the neutral player have in the end to do King making decission. At least it happened in our game. I won with 1 point because of the vote from the neutral player in the last turn.
I'm really looking forward to play with 4. Anyhow great game and my rating might increase with 4

RATING: 6
This game is very nice with a mix of majority, election and action selection. The way cash, aging, majority and votes blend together is great. Must have been pretty revolutionary when it came out.

Unfortunately for me, it's showing its age. Gameplay is much more involved and deep that you would expect from a game "supposed" to take 90 minutes to play. The game has high interaction so implies a metagame that players need to account for with the usual leader bashing and king making problem associated with it. Also, I feel it's probably only good with 4 players.

While it's a great game, I can't see myself willing to play it too often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This rating and the following comments are after a single play of a 4-player game (I've been told this game is broken for any number of players other than 4).  It's hardly fair to rate this game after only 1 play since it has various interesting layers of strategy and so much depth that the appreciation for the game as well as the "fun factor" would likely increase with subsequent plays.  But fairness be damned - I'm going to rate it anyhow!  In comparison to a couple of other heavier Euro-style games that I've played. this one seemed to be relatively easy to catch on to (and in fact, I ended up winning my first play!).  Yet those layers of strategic depth would definitely take several games to explore in detail.  There are also a few rather fun mechanics at play, such as the aging of the characters and the boy/girl offspring.  As for the production quality, it's fairly basic and functional, with only a wee bit of confusion over the symbolism on a couple of the cards.  I enjoyed giving this game a play-through and was impressed by how well balanced the game was with 4 players of different experience levels, but I'm not really willing to devote the time and mental energy that it deserves when there are so many other games that I enjoy more (such as "Reef Encounter" and "Maharaja: Palace Building in India" that I have only played once and would come back to before this one.

I have really liked this game from the first play many years ago.  But newer games have taken it's place.

It's a very good four player game with so many tough choices in such a short amount of time.

The rules are the worst part of the game.  However, using the files from BGG user 'EvilTimmy' help make the game easier to play and easier to explain.

RATING: 5
Maybe there's a good game here and it's simply so counterintuitive that I didn't get to the crux of it on my first playing with three players.  It seemed that the main way to generate VPs was in the "little" elections by taking control of a duchy away from another player (worth 2VP).  The "big" election for emperor got a lot of focus but didn't ultimately seem to be so lucrative in VP production.  There were a lot of details in the game (aging, offspring, etc.), but they weren't that interesting to manipulate and didn't seem to add up to an engrossing struggle.  But, as I say, this is all on first impressions; I'm willing to give it another try and see if something will "click" for me.

RATING: 7
Solid game.  Great mechanics, and a fairly original feel. I am surprised there is no tie-breaker (though I am glad there isn't a random one), because the game takes a full two hours, and the scores won't be seperated by much.  Seems like a purely 4-player game, which isn't a problem as long as you know it.  I am looking forward to my next play.

I liked the game but found it a bit unrealistic that you do not get any victory points by staying in power in an electorate, only by gaining power in one. Yes, you can prevent others from getting victory points by holding on to power in an electorate, but if you do that and other players take turns being electors in the other electorates you will lose because they will get more victory points.

This is a terrific game. I love the theme, the beautifully crafted and balanced mechanics, and the great components and artwork.

Kremlin with fewer fiddly aspects and far less record-keeping. Some of the goals (don't hold positions - gain them, lose them, gain them back) and the scoring are a bit non-intuitive.

Interesting and unusual, but ultimately uninspiring and probably not engaging enough to stay in my collection for the long term.

RATING: 8
This game makes my brain tired.  It's probably my favourite game that makes the players constantly agonize over ever-shrinking options.  I really enjoy trying to predict what action my opponents are itching to grab and using it against them before they get the chance.  

My preference for this (and El Grande) over many other German strategy games (like Princes of Florence or St. Petersburg) is due to the fact that my actions directly screw the other players; I'm not simply further limiting their options as a by-product of my actions.  Nobody could claim that this is multi-player solitaire.  It's got some teeth.

RATING: 6
It's a good game, just not one I like to play. With repeated play (and I'm not seeing that), my rating would likely go up, because there's a lot of game here and tons to consider. Maybe a little too much, this game really suffers from analysis paralysis. You have to calculate a lot. Though the game does a real great job of balancing itself, in a 3-player game one person either gets to be the emperor-maker or emperor-basher. Nothing in between! With 4 players there is bound to be more suspense in the election of the emperor. Good thing for one about this game is that it is proof that Euros can very well have a good theme. The theme of medieval Germany and the royal families striving to have the next emperor in their lines goes along very well with the games' story and mechanisms. I almost feel bad rating this game so low given the fact that some of the mechanisms within the game are by far the most original I have met in boardgames in a long time and that the game comes with an area-control-element with a nice twist to this mechanism. I really feel like I should like this game better.

It plays like an old Mayfair game: Somewhat long and dry, with a few too many rules to be elegant. It's not a bad game if everyone has played it before, but there are just too many better options when I'm looking for a 90+ minute game.

I think this game is horribly under-rated, but I can't get it to the table enough to prove that. The "voting" for new emperor bothers me a little bit in my two plays. It doesn't feel as interesting or as tense as I think it should...but maybe it's OK.

  The theme is well integrated.  Very interactive.  Special Powers.  Rewards aggression.  Still in the learning curve though... hoping it turns into all sorts of fantastic once I start seeing the board better.  Could play 3 straight games at the moment.  Theme very rarely wins me over, but it just shines through here.  Perfect information, yet dynamic at the same time.  

I like how this game plays.  The better the players, the better the game.  Everyone needs to grok the dynamic elements.  If this happens this game has a very nice flow to it.  The game tells a story of dynasties and shifting power and offspring.  If I could write a lick I could write a nice epic session report to prove this, but I can't so you'll have to take my word on it.

The rulebook has no mention of negotiation, and neither do my games.  Playing it properly is an amazing experience.

I throughly enjoyed this game.  We only had 3 players and I'm certain with 4 it's going to rock even more.  Honestly I'm glad it doesn't go up to 5 as that would probably be too much.  I think I'm going to really enjoy exploring different ways to play this one.

UPDATE: A week later I'm still thinking about this game...ahhh the mark of a good game.  I think I love this game but not sure need to play it more to find out and can't wait to see if it goes to 9.

I'm a sucker for area control games (El Grande, San Marco, Louis XIV), so it came as no surprise that I really enjoyed In the Shadow of the Emperor.  It's yet another area control game, but with two interesting twists.  First, your units age and die so the game is less static than El Grande since you lose control over time.  Second, the game is also more dynamic than most area control games because you gain points by taking over control of new regions, not maintaing control of the same regions.  I like both of these changes quite a bit.  While it is unlikely to unseat El Grande or San Marco from my Top 10, it's yet another area control game that is certainly different enough to be worth owning.  I added it to my wishlist right after playing it once.

Brilliant game. Unfortunately, in spite the best efforts of the authors, the rules had some gaps. Just go to FAQ and player's aids here and you will find the answers. It worths the effort to go through the rules (although the basic concept is simple and intuitive). Great game after you give it a try. Everything is well connected, but new players make a have a hard time to grasp winning strategies. The components are functional but I wish they had plastic figures instead of cardboard markers. Also, the game feels better (and eliminates mistakes by accidental movement of the money markers) if you play with coins to indicate the amount of money that each player has. A "must" game for strategy lovers.

Germany in the late middle ages! It is a time of flourishing cities, influential bishops, the powerful popes, and a pompous aristocracy. In such a volatile climate, no dynasty can remain in power for long. Several aristocratic families seek to acquire the crown of the emperor. But this decision lies in the hands of the seven electors. 2–4 imperial candidates use their knights and cities, marry their barons, and work to influence the electors. But all efforts are useless if the candidate is not elected. But, in the shadow of the properly elected emperor are always those who want to displace him.

Surprisingly good game. Essentially an area control game, but the area control doesn't directly score points. Instead, majority in an area provides special abilities and votes toward becoming emperor (which provides its own benefits like points, money, and breaking ties). There's also an interesting voting mechanic for deciding who becomes emperor.

RATING: 9
Fascinating.  A Euro that still has a lot of thematic ties, although those are streamlined behind some abstractions.  You are not forced to play it thematically, but if you like the theme, you can find lots of little ties to it all over.  The loose conglomeration of city-states electing an Emperor as happened in the Holy Roman Empire is perfect for an area-majority Euro.  Luckily, this game capitalizes well on the potential.  The card selection mechanism is quite fascinating, particularly in how it also affects what sex of descendant you get.  The aging and the role of women/couples in the game are also historically interesting, particularly the electorates that can only be taken by people in the church, viz. single males.  Wish the women could be useful without males, but at least they are modeled somehow, which is much better than I can say about the gender politics of most games.  This is a very fresh-feeling design, a real hidden gem.

RATING: 8
Rated after six four-player games and five victories... Might get really slow depending on the company, because of the volume of choices. Lots of reacting, proacting, acting, planning etc. Theme is nice and well pasted over the game. The rules could be clearer though.

The box is ugly, but the components are ok.

What I like about this game, there is the constant feeling, that each player has some huge plans, which will usually fail and they end up putting down the flames. This is an open information game, but so many different possibilities and ways of playing, that it is just impossible to try to think every possibility. Also the fact, that when you are the Emperor, you get even more power, gives an extra nasty feel to the game.

Updated after the seventh play, I really like this game still (I seem to win quite a lot, too), but it is really hard to get on the table. This basically needs four, and it is not always easy. I like the mechanics, theme, nastiness etc, but I can trade this for something else, which is easier to get table time. :(

This game has a lot going on- from the different types of units to the special abilities to the area-majority game, the election game, the action cards, and how it is all tied into such a cohesive whole-! The fact that the theme is also extremely well integrated into the mechanics is just icing on an already delicious cake. Only played with 4 though; can't see it working with 3 or 2.

I like the balance of all the mechanics, and the complexity of the game.   There's a lot to keep up with, overall, and since there's no luck in the game, it has a strong appeal.  Unfortunately, there's so much going on that it's hard for me to track and balance my choices, so it's not quite my thing.  I'm interested in playing more to see how it holds up to repeat playings.

Having played it now for 4 times, the game is a true gem in my opinion. I just love it! The fact that you score points only when you acquire a new electorate and not when you keep one, which is a little bit controversial since you want to keep some electorates for the benefits they provide, is in my opinion the magnificent mechanism of the game. I definitely want more plays as I have a hunger to play this game. The rating will probably go further up if I play it 4-5 more times and have the same feeling as I do now.

There were a lot of neat things that came together in this one.  I liked the aging aspect of the aristocrats and the variety of actions offered by the cards.  There did seem to be fewer useful options toward the end of the game, but I'm also not sure we fully grasped the importance of the voting card actions.  I also liked the level of interaction between players.  There was some ability to mess with your opponents plans but not so much that you could completely knock someone out of the game.  Also, no rule for tiebreakers?  I'm not sure the title of emperor is something people would be willing to share...

A solid game of area control with a voting and aging mechanic. The interesting aspect of the game is that you only get points for winning an electorate, and not for holding on to it. This means the royal families are always moving around, looking to gain power somewhere else. This is a great game for my collection.

Finally played this, but only 2-p a few times. I suspect it's best with 4 (36 spaces + 7 electors + 1 emp = very uncrowded board with < 4 p.). Odd as it may seem given how difficult choices are early on, I'd prefer even more cards. But unlike many games that weren't "great" at first blush, this one is sticking in my mind, so that's a good sign.  However, it fails my litmus test for accessiblity/audience, which is unfortunate.

Control political or church leaders with the aim of winning particular regions and getting one of your guys in the chair for that region; or try to aim to get one of your guys in the chair as emperor.

It feels similar to Kremlin or the mafia game Nothing Personal in that you're trying to promote your guys to higher channels and demote or otherwise screw up others.

Honestly, I thought the game is above average. Its alright, its not great.  I wanted a game where the sense of political connections had a baring on decision making; but instead I found myself wondering what regions I could win, regardless of what they actually did.

Further, I felt the emperor, other than giving votes, does nothing.  He doesn't have any passing of laws, there's no sense of power behind the throne, which is a game I am looking for.

It was OK, but I don't think its worth playing again.

Rather interesting game!  Jockey for position with perishable potentates.  Fascinating!

cool game but needs 4p to be good. 3p is fair and 2p is poor
update:  4p is not much better than 3p. also very long for what really is

After 1 Play: I've only gotten to play one game, and that was cut short.  I love the theme and really like the aging mechanic, but I'm not sure how I feel about the voting.  I'm really hoping to give this another try to get a better feel for it.

After 2+ Plays: I still enjoy it but find it hard to explain well, so it doesn't get played much.

Was not impressed with my one playing of this but will try again (if I can find a willing group).

Interesting, but agonizing; way too prone to analysis paralysis. Hard to avoid that too, considering the perfect information and number of options. I like the theme, but perhaps this doesn't work with three.

06/23/08 - I did not get a very favorable first impression of this game, but I am hoping that it will improve with more experience.

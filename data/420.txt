Monopoly hits the rails! Sentimental favorite. Use to own Boxcars but sold it on EBay for seventy dollars.

Recently downloaded the No Chart Variant from BGG. It is outstanding. It puts one more decision in the hands of the players and gets rid of that difficult to read Payoff Chart.

Rail Baron is a game for 3 to 6 players. It's played on a large map board of the United States Rail-Road network. It potrays the 28 major rail lines and major cities they connected during the halcyon days of railroading. You become a latter day Gould, or a Corelius Vanderbilt, or any of those menacingly infamous moguls whose wizadry and acumen established the criteria for which business success will be judged in later decades.
Randomly determine a destination city and start your trip across the United States. Pay rail line fees that your train uses to make this trip. Once you arrive at your destination city, receive your payoff for making this important delivery. As you accumulate cash, purchase rail lines and decrease your cost of rail line fees. Upgrade trains with the purchase of an Express or a Superchief to make quicker deliveries. Become the 1800s first Rail Baron?

Expected playing time is about 2.5 - 3 hours.

This game would get a much higher rating for me, but it's a little bit broken in that it's entirely possible for, through no fault of your own, to be crippled so badly early in the game that it is a near-impossibility to ever make any progress in the game whatsoever.  It's happened to me twice in the last two games I've played.  Given the length of the game, you're better off committing ritual suicide and going off and doing something else than spending the next several hours rolling, moving, paying other people everything you make and never being able to buy anything, desperately wishing the game would end.

Near as I can tell, all you're doing is rolling dice, looking at tables to see what happens, and then rolling dice to arrive at your destinations.

I suppose there might be more to it, but it's likely I'll never get around to exploring, as there's other games I'd rather play.

RATING: 7
[i]Posted: 6/24/05, Rated: 7[/i]

At its core, [i]Rail Baron[/i] is about rolling the dice, and moving your train to the next, randomly-selected destination.  Trains go where the rails lead, and in this game you travel along pre-printed rail lines to get there.  These game mechanics are simple, and are easy to learn: you don't have to worry about matching shipping manifests with cities that have a high demand for certain goods.

The choices you do have to make are concerned with which rail lines will you purchase?  It is common to see certain cities "locked out" by having all of their available routes purchased by other players.  Luck factors heavily into the game at this point, as several unfortunate destination rolls may cause you to pay exorbitant fees to ride on someone else's lines.

A couple of drawbacks include the payoff system, which requires frequent lookups on a table to determine the money earned for completing a trip.  Another irritation is trying to determine the most cost-effective route between two points, and then making sure you pay the appropriate owners of any line segments you may have used along the way.

Still, [i]Rail Baron[/i] is fun to play, if a tad on the long side for its simplicity.

200+ plays.  I think it's funny when reading on BGG how folks regret teaching newbies game "x" and then (like creating Frankenstein's Monster) suffering through the subsequent requests for same game "x" at the expense of everything else.  In the 80s and 90s, I had an incredibly successful track record in bringing folks to the boardgame hobby by introducing them to Rail Baron.  I still enjoy it immensely despite the 3 hour game time.  A shame it is OOP, but I'm gladly holding on to this one, complete with coffee stain on the board, worn down cards, and charts so over-handled I had to laminate them.  A future family heirloom, certainly!

One corner of the box top is stained and creased with some bowing. The printing is also splitting off of the same corner. The rest of the edges show wear. One pawn is gray with the matching chips being green. One Rail line card is missing with a hand written replacement. The map boards have some small stain spots. None of this interferes with the play of the game.

Enjoy it, but I've always thought it went too long, especially after the buying is done.  Am looking forward to trying the Railgamefan's rules for a quicker game.  They look solid, and I know it would make quicker and more tense.

Back up to a 7 after a recent playing.  If it's only once a year, I love this game.  I take back what I said about shortening the rules...it needs to go the distance as that will truely allow the best network to shine (and win).

Played again.  Still very long to be a regular game anymore.  But, I moved my rating back up to an eight.  Experience is big in this game in knowing how and what to purchase railroad wise.  The "boring" part of the game for many (after the rails are bought) is important.  This is when you know if your network is truely good.  With all the dice rolls in involves, it's not as much "luck of the die" but knowning the probibilities of areas you are going to.   I personally will probably not play the game with more than four people.  It feels like three is the best number.

An improvement over Monopoly (R.B. is more strategic), but not a huge improvement.  In 1977 when the game debuted, this was probably a top-tier game... but it pales in comparison to modern Euro games.  

The 2nd half of the game (once all of the railroads are owned) is almost entirely based on the luck of the dice... and the game almost plays itself at that point.  The 1st half of the game where players are making strategic choices and trying to buy up the best network of routes (based on their "home" city) is pretty fun, though.

I enjoy the computer version quite a bit.  Some of the areas seem to be a bit unbalanced and certain railroads can significantly help players (Pennsylvania, for example), sometimes giving it a runaway leader problem.  However, I still enjoy it as I unfortunately play it about once a year.

Very exciting back in the day - but there are much better train games now. This one offers little - purchase patterns seem fixed, so it just devolves into a dicefest, and it requires an annoying amount of counting and preplanning of moves to manage to be a bit of light fun.

Once upon a time, theme was enough to make this palatable.

I've always liked train games, geography games, and also games based in solid historical accuracy.  The train routes have been thoroughly thought out.  One of the few games one of my brothers will play with me (because he's a train buff).  Still, this is a long game, that easily becomes monotonous--moving, paying, buying rail lines.  I do love the payoff chart and the end of game chance.  Not for everyone, but a keeper for me.

Experience: I played it several times in the 1970's and another few in the last few years

Thoughts: It features a good theme and so-so production value, but this title has not aged well.  The mechanics are far too roll-dice/check-chart intensive; game turns a number of fairly shallow decisions.

I play a shortened variant; reducing the cost of each railroad by about half. Without this variant this title is not worth the time.

I really wish the second half of this game could be changed somehow.  The first half is fantastic (I'd rate it a 9 or 10), as the decisions regarding building your network can be pretty complex and a careful balance.  However, once the railroads are all taken, it is effectively an algorithmic game requiring almost no decisions whatsoever.

This is sort-of the Monopoly of train games. Not to say it is un-enjoyable, just that it's been around and it includes the concept of ownership of train lines (properties) and you have to pay the line owners if you use their rails (rent). Its much better than Monopoly as there are other issues involved. I played this recently and we enjoyed ourselves tremendously.

There is some nastalgia involved in the enjoyment for me, as we used to play this 25 yrs ago in college.

RATING: 1
Imagine that you’re playing a [thing=1406]Monopoly[/thing] variant.  The rule changes are these: 
(1) Every property begins with a hotel. 
(2) You get $2,000 for passing Go, and it provides the game’s only opportunity to purchase property (one of your choice). 
(3) Every time you roll, you can decide whether to go backward or forward.
(4) Every time you land on a property, you can choose to instead land on any other property of the same color.  
(5) The dice are weighted so that the odds of landing on properties are wildly divergent.
(6) Those odds are not reflected in the purchase price of the properties. 
(7) You win by collecting $30,000.

The resulting five-hour, dice-rolling, sandbagging, kingmaking mess of a game, full of meaningless decisions and wild swings of luck, would not be terribly different than playing a game of [thing=420]Rail Baron[/thing].  

In Rail Baron, each player is...I don’t actually know.  It’s a little confusing.  But here’s how it works.  You roll dice and consult a chart.  That tells you your destination (say, Memphis).  You roll dice each turn to move your piece (representing a train?) toward your destination.  On the way, you choose whether to take rail lines owned by your opponents (paying them money for the privilege) or those owned by you or the bank (paying the bank considerably less money).  Once you reach your destination, you get paid some money based on how far you traveled.  Then you can buy an unowned rail line (and hope that others use it).  Next turn, you roll for a new destination.  That’s right: random goals, random movement, and the only choices are either to save money (obvious) or, if you can’t, to choose which other player you want to give money to.  You do this for [i]hours[/i].

Despite the fact that Rail Baron barely qualifies as a game, I actually had a good time playing it.  Something about the experience was simply so over-the-top absurd that those of us who were desperately flailing around in last place with no hope of winning just kept laughing at the nonsense of it all.  If nothing else, the sheer length of the game also gives it a sense of grandeur missing from today’s balanced 45-minute Euros.  So the game gets a surprisingly higher rating than I would have expected from the mechanics.  I actually had fun, and I hope to never play it again.

Eyrops summed this one up nicely:

"The phrase "Rail Monopoly" is apt to describe this one. Once all the rail lines are bought the game drags too long. This is also one of the few games where choices appear (at least to me) to be very obvious, but still cause a lot of analysis paralysis. It's good for a once-in-a-blue-moon play, but I would like it more if the end-game could be fixed (shortened by >90%). Far too long for what it is."

Couldn't agree more. However, I am curious who the goofy guy on the box cover is.

One of my first strategy games.  Two notes strike me about this game.

1. We used a third, different colored die on each basic roll... adding another die for the superchief when purchased.  We used the two original dice to control the "Express" card.  This made the game much more enjoyable.  The die roll distribution was a bell curve, making for more consistent rolling, and the game was shorter.

2. The picture on the cover, of the "Rail Baron" (If you have this edition) is priceless.  What did they do, only take one picture?!?!  "Hey, his eyes are closed in the picture!  No matter, it's the only one we have!"

Rail on!  Hate the rover play at the end, though.

The map is really cool, better than the map for Ticket to Ride.  However, the game is not very fun to play.  The game takes too long and there is way too much dice rolling.

RATING: 6.5
A very nice thinking game. I feel like I can pour myself a nice Scotch and really delve into this one. Knowing the game is pretty critical, as someone with greater experience will know which routes matter more. After my first play, I learned mostly that you build routes to protect yourself so you can reach different parts of the country (as opposed to just collecting from someone else).

Significant negatives are the fact that the lookup tables are slow, and trying to remember what dotted route is which is hard. This can lead to AP as people tend to look things up to figure out optimal (cheapest, shortest) routes.

Also, I've only played this once, but I have a good suspicion that this is really just a big luck fest, and the critical parts of the game all happen near the end (and luck might just take you most of the way there). I need to play more to test this out!

Still, a nice game all together. Would love to see a re-theme or newer version of this game come out.

Once upon a time the king of rail games, Rail Baron has since diminished with the onset of crayon rail, Age of Steam, and Ticket to Ride titles.  More of a monopoly on rails, some of the mechanics (such as the endgame) make little thematic sense.  But still has a "fun" aspect to it.

HMMM.. mixed feelings about this game GREAT start of the game and for most of the game very good game... but as the game winds down to the end it gets very LONG drawn out and the last place person(s) end up playing kingmaker rather than playing the game :( soo we implemented new end game rules when the first person has to sell their first rail road to prevent from becoming bankrupt, that is the last turn of the game everyone finishes that turn and then count the $$s and see who wins... With that implementation the "kingmaker" problem and the drag for the last person(s) playing gets removed. We just figured that from that point on its usually all down hill anyways for that player and instead of playing the game as it should be (in our opinion) they start taking sides and making one or another person the winner even tho in effect they cant win any more.

My ex-wife took it with her when we divorced but recently gave it back to me, along with all the other games she took, because she said she "doesn't have time for games." Her loss...my gain! LOL!

Update: Re-introduced to the game at the 2013 World Boardgame Championships. Had a blast playing it! Have since introduced it to others in my gaming group and had as much fun with it as in past years. As a result, I've upped my rating.

It does not look like Monopoly but it is the same type of game. You travel from city to city gaining money along the way. You also need to buy railroad networks to make it cheaper for you to travel and hopefully make the other players pay you to use your tracks. I've been playing this game for about 20 years and it has not gotten old. One of the best of this type of game and fun for the whole family.

The hard board map depicts the USA and its railway connections, in the age of locomotive. With a small capital at start and a train, players move around cities and collect delivery payoffs. Then they try to buy parts of each railway belonging to very many railway companies forming an entire network. The game play reminds something of the classical monopoly. Not my taste. This AH’s game is more family/kids orientated.

Rail Baron is, to me, the basic example of a train game. You buy railroads and use them to make trips to get money to buy railroads. Rinse and repeat. Recently repackaged as Boxcars.

For a fan of Monopoly, this could be a fun trains-only game. But the mechanism is slow and game play drags on repetitively for three hours. It was a decent bookshelf game in the 1980s, but now I would suggest Ticket to Ride or Rolling Freight as much better light or medium train games.

Great 3 player game.  With 4+ players, by the middle of the game it's pretty obvious which players won't have a shot at winning.  They must endure the remainder of the game in agony, barely surviving, while the leaders amass the required wealth to win.  The first half of the game is great fun for everyone, but the second half is pretty much made up of the haves and have-nots.  Seems kind of broken as a game.

This is an old AH game that I remember wanting play back in the day but never did because I was so busy with wargames and Statis-Pro Baseball. Thank God I didn’t. So here's the game: you randomly roll for a destination, then roll dice each turn trying to move there over colored tracks. You pay $1000 per turn, regardless of how many spaces. When you get there, you get money and can buy a railroad (which control certain colored tracks). If you have to move over tracks controlled by another player, you have to pay them $5000. You do this over and over for about 3 or 4 hours until someone has bled all the other players of money. 

I couldn't believe how painfully dull this game was. I have a friend who likes his old school AH games, and it *is* from 1977, so I understand it was probably cool for the time, but it's really just sophisticated Monopoly. Roll and move, buy up track monopolies, wait for other players to land on your property.

The phrase "Rail Monopoly" is apt to describe this one. Once all the rail lines are bought the game drags too long. This is also one of the few games where choices appear (at least to me) to be very obvious, but still cause a lot of analysis paralysis. It's good for a once-in-a-blue-moon play, but I would like it more if the end-game could be fixed (shortened by >90%). Far too long for what it is.

If you have more than 4, luck rules the game, people sit and watch early and if you don't get either the Central, Pensy, B&O, or C&O, you most likely do not have a chance.  I've never won without one of these railroads.  Same goes for having to own the SoPac, Santa Fe or UP although they are not a crucial.

This is the game that 15 or 20 years ago showed me the possibilities of board games.  I had lots and lots of fun with this one.  It is kind of one of the grandfathers of the games we enjoy today.  The problem with Rail Baron now is that it is dated and has flaws, which is understandable since it was a pioneer game.  The first flaw is the length of the game.  It goes on FOREVER.  The second flaw is that it is tedious with charts for the payments one receives after completing routes.  Lastly, the rover play really makes no sense.  But, it was a great game in its day and would probably be fun every now and then for old times sake.

There's a lot wrong with this game.  It's essentially impossible to do anything unless you draw the right cards, and most of the cards are the same, so that doesn't help. The game is basically over about halfway through, but it still takes a couple more hours to play it through after the winner has already been determined.  A lot of the other stuff you do is pretty random, too. Besides, the game is just boring.  Maybe it seemed better back when it was first designed.  (1 play)

What's remarkable about Rail Baron is how long you can play it before you realize how broken it is.  Because of the flawed ending mechanism, 90% of the effort you put into the game has no bearing on your chance of winning in the end.

A lucky game with generally obvious strategies (Hmmm, I want one of the major RR&#039;s in the Northeast... if I can screw someone going to Portland/Rapid City/etc., do so... try to get at least one of the big 3... try to get connections to each region). Yes, there&#039;s a little more to it than that. Yes, the better players tend to win more. This all would be OK, if the game didn&#039;t take forever. And then there&#039;s a ridiculous &quot;rover&quot; rule that can drag the game out even longer. I do like owning the railroads and assembling an empire. Side note: for such a whimsical game, I&#039;ve seen this game bring out the worst in people.

This is a classic train game, with brutal payment schedules, auctioning, and route planning.  Overall, it is a delivery game with people trying to complete routes to make money.  The game, like many classic games, is too long for what it is, generally taking mulitple hours to complete.  While people at BGG complain about monopoly being long and tedious, they are more forgiving for other games, such as this one.  While I enjoyed the game, the benefits of modern game design and trends make newer games more fun and enjoyable.

I used to rate this a 6, but my kids made me raise the rating when they saw my page on the Geek.  It has too much luck, it's a repetitive, it's too long for what it is, but the strategy of building a rail network is appealing, and it is one of the games my family has played the most, since my kids understood it from a young age, and if you play often, you can speed it up considerably. (We've been playing it for 10 or 12 years, much longer than I've been recording games on the Geek.)

Played dozens of times, especially 1977-1986.  It is still a welcome game to bring out for the evening amongst my friends.

I find most of the comments from detractors relate to elements that overlook railroad history, probably from simple ignorance.  This game was very much designed with rail history and operations of the 1950s in mind.  An appreciation of that history will unquestionably increase one's appreciation of the game.

For 2-6 players, best with 3-4.

Monopoly with rail lines. Perhaps with a touch more strategy. Fun for all and a good gateway towards the more "hardcore" rail games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely an older style game that was ahead of its time but perhaps supplanted by newer games.  I think it's a little too long for me to want to play it on a regular basis, and also highly dependent on dice rolls.  I don't really mind the luck of the dice, but for such a long game it can be discouraging to be completely out of it for hours.  I like the system of developing networks, and familiarity with the different railroads definitely helps.  It seems like you just cannot shorten the game without dramatically altering the strategies involved.  I like how the game gathers momentum toward the end.  I would definitely hesitate to play this with too many people though, as the downtime would be a killer.  I think my favorite thing about this game is Tim consistently reminding people to pay their operating costs, "that will be 1,000."

Update: Gave away my copy to Tim after he lost his game collection when his shed caught on fire.

Though maligned by some, I think this railroad game stands the test of time, and in many ways is as good, if not better that some of the rail games of the 21st century. I like that the real railroads are printed already on the map, which is very colorful. Also, there are some interesting variants people have submitted on the Geek which make the game more enjoyable.

Network building game with much dice rolling. Aside from a few arbitrary and/or unfortunate changes to the map and destination charts, the Swedish rip-off Rymdimperiet is actually superior to the original: it shortens the game, simplifies rolling and eliminates the rover play. I would play that on rare occasions for the sake of nostalgia much as I can see those who grew up with Rail Baron revisiting the original game.

This is a very hard game for me to rate.  Given the printed rules, I'd have to rate it as nearly unplayable over the board (maybe a 4).  The shame is that it is a game from a different era and I can see how it was a favorite back in its day.  Buying routes and building one's network is good fun and makes for an interesting hour and a half.  Sadly then, the game devolves into endless die rolls to determine a winner and this process takes at least as long as the interesting part of the game.  I also have major issues with the "rover" endgame.  After completing a 4 hour game and being ready to declare oneself for the final trip to the home city, who wants to have to roll the dice and move across the country repeatedly until there's no one around to steal your cash supply?

I hate this game.  It is an early cross between crayon rails and 18XX.  The first 3 hours were fun.  You buy companies and move around the map making deliveries.  But after you get to the point where the game can end, it takes 3 hours for it to end.  This game was awful.  It is not broken but I don't want to play a repetitive boring game when I could play a long game like 1830 and have fun.

10/21/03 I don't like train games. Played once under duress. Never again. Game lasted 3.5 hours, and I was bored the last 1.5 after all the rail lines had been bought.

I never tire of this game and the family like it too, which helps!  Simple to play but highly tactical.  Good fun.  Fundamentally similar to Monopoly but this is ten times the game Monopoly is.  I can understand why purist gamers might not like it due to heavy reliance on dice but the strategy of which railroads to go for keeps the game interesting.  There are broadly three stages to it: an initial stage of accumulating railroads, a middle bit that can get a bit tedious as you acquire money, and then a slightly bizarre 'end game'.

Despite it's long duration, and the duller middle stage, we love it.  The rules are easy.  We tend to play it in short spells over 2-3 sessions.

The end game can be a big anti-climax if you follow the exact rules.  We have a rule that the final journey home attempted must be at least 9 spaces.  Otherwise, a long and tense game can end in a huge let-down at the end.

Recently replaced my long lost copy (without having to resort to a copy bought from eBay). I have very fond memories of this game. But I'm not sure it's fair to rank it against the current generation of rail games. Holding out to rank it after it hit's the table again.

EDIT: (After replaying Rail Baron a few times in 2012) It is what it is. My love of this game stems from nostalgia. And that nostalgia helps fuel my fondness for it. It seems unfair to rate it in the context of modern game design.

Why do I give Rail Baron such a low rating?  Does it lack a fun factor?  Not really, it is a sort of enjoyable experience....Is it due to its grueling length?  No...I can actually get down with long games that drag into the night making you beg for death.  Does the theme suck??  Hell no!  I freakin' love train games.  You could draw a train on a piece of paper, sh@t on top of it and I would still play it. How about the incessant dice rolling?  That might be part of it but I can live with dice.  Well what is it then?  Hmmm....how about the complete lack of meaningful decisions the game presents?  Yeah, that definitely knocks it down a few points!  How about the mind numbing confusion that is the migraine inducing rail network?  Yeah, minus another few points (unless you are on acid...then you might be stoked).  Oh..Oh..perhaps the retro-grouch following, nostalgia-boner this game this game has (causing it to fetch ridiculous prices BTW) ?  Yeah, that knocks it down a decimal point or two.  So does the silly endgame situation and the ever present "it doesn't matter" what I do feeling.

I once met a mystic in the desert regions of the American Southwest who happened to love boardgames.  He taught me many things including the ways of reading a game's "aura".  I promise you that Rail Baron emits an oozing brown glow that you do not want to come into contact with.

I imagine if I grew up playing this game I would absolutely love it and still want to play it!  Having said that, it kind of blows my mind that newer generations of gamers are jonesin' for the ol' stinky baron and his pasted on scat mustache...I mean damn, look at all the better games out there!  There are dozens of 'em.  Better long games...better train games...better long-train games...better long-train-dice rolling games.  Quit acting like a junkie trying to score your train game fix with Rail Baron.  It is like dirty heroin!  Stay back son!

Speaking of dirty heroin...people often compare Rail Baron to Monopoly (the dirtiest of dirties).  Yeah, that is a fitting description but I would probably rather play Monopoly (yes I *did* just say that).

Will I play Rail Baron in the future?  Maybe if a few friends request it...but even then I would be hesitant to do so unless those friends promised to buy me pizza, beer, and rent me a season of Battlestar Galactica to watch while I fall deep into autopilot mode.  Yeah sure, I'll play...Just don't expect me to try very hard or give a frack.

Played this roll-and-move affair a lot back in the day when there weren't many better RR games to play. I remember enjoying it despite the silly endgame rules. Whose idea was putting that oily looking dude on the box cover? Much later added Winsome's variant U.S. Rails to the mix but only tried it once--the jury's still out and may be for a long time.

This is a game that when I play, I know the dice are conspiring against me (if someone's going to roll to have to move cargo to Miami, it's going to be me).  That said, it's a good beer and pretzels game to play with friends.  If you can find a copy, that is; I've seen this game go for over $100 on eBay, and I'm not planning on giving up my copy anytime soon.

If you're a railroad nut, I'm sure there'll be some nits to pick with the railroads selected (what, no Reading or Monon?) and the routes entered (a friend once added an extra line for the C&O on his copy to be more historically accurate), but it's a fun game that will keep people engaged.  Even with the Rover play, trying to bash the leader is hard in this game, and usually the odds will even out over the course of a 3-4 hour game.  The person who purchases the railroads that best suit their needs will be the one to win the game.

I no longer have the desire to spend five hours playing this game, but at one time I couldn't play this one often enough.  I even made an odds table of your most likely destination cities and regions.  Here's a hint, the Northeast is the most common region so getting a good railroad line in the northeast (the Pennsylvania is best) is more important than the UP or Santa Fe.

Train game based on railroads in the US. Roll for your starting destination and ending destination and pay for the use of railroads. Travel allowance is determined by rolling dice. Once you reach a destination receive a payout proportional to the length of your trip, and you may buy railroads. You may also upgrade your train to roll a third die, or roll the third die when you roll doubles. Strategies evolve whether you buy short rail lines to attempt to seal people off and get them to pay or buy large railroads to get good coverage of the U.S. Winner has to make it safely home without being touched by another opponent. I played this a ton in the mid 80's, and this was one of the first real train games published. There certainly is a lot of luck, some decision making and games do tend to take all afternoon or evening. I would only play this for nostalgic reasons. Back in the 80's there wasn't much selection of games as there is now, so this game saw a lot of table time, but everyone has outgrown this game now.

We played for 4 hours, and I made about 8 meaningful decisions. Maybe 12 if I was being generous. Extremely boring. The only way this game could be worse is if it had chance cards. 

This is a roll and move game, basically train monopoly, without the good elements of monopoly. I would rather play monopoly twice, and I hate monopoly.

I got to play a few rounds of a PnP version of this. The turn sequence is REALLY frustrating, and I immediately wanted to house rule it. Why would you only be able to buy a RR at the exact moment that you don't need one, and have no idea which one you might need next? I would change it to say that you can only buy one railroad immediately after determining your next destination.

The roll-and-move is a bit annoying, but not a showstopper. We didn't get far enough into the game for me to have a sense of how cutthroat it gets.

The oldest game in my collecion. I played this a lot as a teen, and the components reflect it. It is heavily bruised and battered. I'm not sure if I'd enjoy playing it as much now, but back then it was my only exposure to heavy strategy games.

RATING: 7
I really do like this game. It is very much like Monoploy but better in so many ways. The only thing I dislike about it is the length of the game (usually not as long as Monopoly) and having to consult a chart every few turns. I wish I had a copy of this one.

RATING: 4
This game feels like a less-constrained version of Monopoly--you're still rolling-and-moving your way across the board, and you own spaces with which you charge other players rent to move through.  However, you have a variety of options on where you want to move, and you can buy any rail network on the board without having to physically be there.  That said, the randomness of the roll-and-move combined with the randomness that determined player's destinations removed most of the potential strategy that could be in this game.  It really turns into a mindless slog.  Plus, the endgame rules about "bumping" the winner's train is really annoying, drags the game out even further, and makes no thematic sense.  Some might argue that the game was good for its time, but, uhh, meh.

The first half of the game is a 7.5 but the last half take a couple of hours when it really should take 30 minutes tops.

Overall a pretty good game.  Easy to get new gamers to play and is still a challenge for more experienced gamers. As with many (most/all) games involving strategy and risk-taking, knowledge of the game is a big advantage over novice players. The game length and the fussiness of rolling for Destinations and especially determining Payoffs lowers the rating one point.

Long dice fest - the first phase when you are acquiring railroads is fine - but the end game doesn't interest me especially with tracking down the leader getting back home after declaring for the win.

Each time I play I'm surprised with how slow of a game it is.

If you get behind on the payout curve it is a long slow process to elimination

This is a very enjoyable game, however it can be quite lengthy.  Using the short game rules are best so you can complete the game in a day.  Short version; regular rules apply, with the following changes: must announce when you have $90k on hand, to win you must have $70k owned lines and $120k cash before entering your home city.  After rolling for your new destination you must declare you are going to your home city.  Anyone can try to catch you to send you to your destination.  Remember you can not double back on track.  Enjoy!

I ended up playing this as it was a game my friend had loved and had when he was younger.  It does have a cool nostalgic feel to it, but for me it was just too long without enough going on.  You move back and forth somewhat based on luck to earn money, buy railways and then hope that someone has to use them.  It really just felt like an advanced version of Monopoly to me.

Good gracious, how many times do you have to look up a payoff on that annoying chart before the game is over?

The main problem with RB is the game takes too long to play, maybe not as long as Monopoly. I thought the victory conditions seemed a bit odd. The other parts of the game I like, rolling for destinations, buying a rail network, and the historical rail companies. If it were redone, I hope those issues will be addressed. All this aside I do love playing RB once and awhile and unless they republish it, I don't see ever selling it. If you have a new player be sure to explain how to win clearly. I made that mistake with my daughter.

Rail Baron is nothing special by today's standards, as it relies very heavily on luck.  However, it does have the distinction of being the only board game which I've witnessed degenerate into a fist fight between two of the players (who were both grown men in their late 20s and had been friends since grade school, without prior physical incident).

This game launched the "adult" phase of my gaming life. Used to gather with more or less the same group and play this religiously. Yeah, it's long, but by the fourth and/or fifth hour with a few brews under the belt, who cared? Recent "fixes" like home city swapping and the purchase of the Super Chief for nothing have speeded things up, not mention the electronic Board Game Conductor which does a lot of the housework, making it go even faster. It's a game you settle in to; more a marathon than a sprint, but there isn't a board game victory anywhere that is more satisfying.

We once played an epic game that saw the four players in the game "declare" 7 times combined. The game can either be a dud or can be one of the most exciting games down the stretch of any game I own.

This was my "grail game" for a while. Then I found a new copy of it still in shrink on here and REALLY splurged on it. No regrets, a really fun game. It is like Railroad Monopoly, but it works well.

Old school railroad game from childhood. Takes too long. good game, but way too long.

RATING: 3
Too long, mid-game drags, especially if someone is over-strategizing.  The whole red rover mechanic is just annoying and makes the game go longer while penalizing a winning player.

RATING: 3
Decent game.  Too much luck of the dice and game sometimes takes forever.  My friends loved it before they knew about all of the Euro games, I think it is long and gets boring.  Monopoly on rails, so it rates a little better due to my love of rail games.

Roll and move, buy railroads, and collect money from players who use your railroads.  I found it hard to figure out which routes belonged to which railroads.  Too much luck, too much table look up, and too long.

Really enjoy it, but modern components make it seeem quaint.  It also takes so long, in comparison, that it doesn't fint into a game night.  It's somewhat of a railroad history lesson as well as a game, and I spent many enjoyable hours with it back in the day.

Missing instructions, 1 black, 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 green chip. Has one extra black player piece and one extra white chip. In decently worn condition; board is in quite good condition, but the box top is pretty beat around the corners.

Played it once and wasn't very impressed.  I'd rather play Ticket to Ride (if I want something light) or the computer version of Railroad Tycoon (if I want an economic model).

An all-time clasic that I and my gaming crew
never get tired of . Great mix of luck (dierolls) with decision making (buying raliroads and mapping out
your routes).

A fairly interesting roll and move game - at least in the first half of the game.  Has elements that remind me of monopoly - buying rail lines rather than properties.  The end game was dreadfully boring in the game(s) I played -.  It was just roll move pay/get paid rinse, repeat.  No strategy at all.  It was a long game that actually took us two sessions and even then we sort of anointed a winner.  I would like it more if there was more to the end game, that was the biggest negative for me and the thing which has made me lower my rating.  Decent beginning phases dreadfully boring end game phase.  Not a game I would actively seek to play again and would probably avoid if people were willing to play something else.

Oh, this one has nostalgia value ok.  But, in comparison to modern games?  I can't see playing it again.

The system is simply outstanding.  The game rules are relatively simple and plays smooth.  The map, counters, and charts are well laid.  The game provides tense situations and a whole lot of fun.

For a year back in college we had all of the destination rolls memorized.

"Monopoly with trains" has the same problem(s) as Monoploy;  too much luck,with both movement and destinations at the whim of the dice, and an early setback (West Coast -> Miami as first trip anyone?) can cripple you.

This copy is missing two player pawns (yellow and black) and one red and blue chip.  Some of the cards are clear-taped, apparently as an earlier form of "sleeving."  The three sections of the board were also taped together by the previous owner.  The box has some dishing on top and two torn corners, one of which has been taped.  This is definitely a player's copy.

I bought this game when it came out a long time ago. Must have played it 100 times. My game is greasy and worn out. Still like to play it once a year. If you can buy it on Ebay go for it.

Rail Baron gets a 5.5 rating up until the point where all lines are sold; at that point, the game drops to a 2.  Average overall rating = 3.75.

My first Rail game. I still love it but it is to long. In a game that you roll the dice several hundred times the most important die roll is to determine turn order.

I thoroughly enjoyed my first (and so far, only) play of this game. It was indeed long, as is commonly noted, but the time flew by. Planning out one's network, choosing the best routes to avoid helping other players, and stealing key pieces from them were a lot of fun. Constantly looking up payouts & destinations gets old, but there's even some excitement in wondering, "Where am I heading next?"

This isn't a wargame at all. Unless you consider the ruthless and bloodthirsty nature of corporate America war.
But it is an incredibly fun game. It was always easy to get my non wargaming friends to play this. Even my kids loved this game. I'm sure my copy has been played at least a hundred times over the years. Not to mention, borrowed a lot.
You buy track and run your train from destination to destination trying to make money on each trip. The key is to always try and use your own track because it can cost you dearly if you have to use the tracks of others.
To really enjoy this game you'll need at least three players and four or more is even better. But be prepared! It's going to take 3 to 4 hours to play to completion.
Great fun. Great game.

Loved it then, still love it now.  I'm amazed at how many people I run across who've played this game before, and who'd like to play again.  The big downfall of the game is the time requirement to finish.

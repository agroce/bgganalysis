A little gem of a game.
Playing Double blind recreates very well the tactical situation.
As the Americans, you know they're coming, but from where?
As the Japanese, your target is Midway, but you are aware that those enemy carriers are somewhere out there.
Seeing your opponent's face is priceless, when you detect (and sink!) his main carrier group while he can't even make a guess on yours.

RATING: 7.4
Solid design with clear rules and decent components.  Overall realistic results, which cannot avoid often being frustrating to gameplay; as others have noted, if one side gets the jump on the other with an ambush strike, the game is largely over barring bizarre happenings involving the remaining surface units.  

I had one enjoyable pbem game where I got the ambush as the Americans, and one sentimentally awkward one where I as the Japs, despite lowballing it here and there, was not quite able to throw the effort without being detected, and ending up winning against the Americans, captained by my increasingly desperate, then nine year old twin sons!  

Good memories of a good system, but not a game you're going to play 20-30 times in your life.  Too knife-edged, and often settled in the course of one fateful round of strikes.

Very nice game; played over Internet once.  The US carriers were in the one place I thought they wouldn't be, and my fleet was smashed, but I still managed to power through and land an abortive invasion force on Midway.  Awesome game!

RATING: 8
Wow, what a gem! Would be a 9 but with only one scenario the replayability is diminished somewhat, although not as much as I would have expected. Very playable but still immersive given its level of abstraction. Except for a few minor quibbles the simulation feels plausable. Not sure I would enjoy it nearly as much without a referee but fortunately refereeing is entertaining in its own right.

Cannot wait until Solomon Sea is reprinted!

RATING: 7
Great little system, lacking the interesting tactical puzzles of the 1964 Avalon Hill Midway game, but fast and fun.  Typical carrier battle game, often the battle is decided with the first air strike and some die rolls.  System is better employed in the larger "Seven Seas to Victory" by the same designer.

[Knight] This is my first swing at a double-blind wargame, and I had a total blast. I don't know when I've had this much fun and anxiety in a game. The tense sub, ship, and air searches are what makes this game a winner, and being found adds fear and tension until night gives you a chance to escape. There's nothing like the dread of seeing dive bombers swarming at you when you have no clue where they came from! The Japanese player has to ferry four slow transports towards Midway, and has six carriers to lure the US into combat. The Americans have little room for error and few assets to work with, but if concentrated they can go toe-to-toe with nearly any group in the theater. Highly recommended!
 
As a side note, this game has some of the best-written rules I've had the pleasure to read ever. Simple, clear, and occasionally even amusing. For the love of god, how did Commmand Magazine do it so well whilst full-fledged outfits like GMT and Fantasy Flight can't manage a single page without errata??

Played once and discovered a dominant strategy for the Japanese player - simply combine all of your forces into a single monster fleet...there are no rules requiring the Japanese commander to keep his forces split up as they were historically.

Just didn't seem very tense. The search system tends to give away the position of your carriers, which is a problem. Despite my attempt to hook around behind the Japanese carriers, making a surprise attack seems all but impossible.

My attacks did destroy the Japanese carrier force, but AAA is so deadly in this game that my air units were devastated. The Japanese player then blithely sailed his battleships and transports to Midway and invaded successfully. The AAA on the battleships is so powerful that I probably wouldn't have been able to stop them if I'd had all my starting air units and there weren't any Japanese carriers in the battle.

I understand that the development of the system in Solomon Seas is much better.

Played only once, and it did not satisfied my expectatives. My opponent and I finished the game without much enthusiasm. After reading comments and reviews here in BGG I was expecting a better game. Anyway, I want to play it again, as one game is not enough to judge a wargame properly.

This might be the best game on Midway, and a great step from Avalon Hill's classic. However, it still rates the Japanese carriers too highly in terms of AA capacity.

RATING: 5
Easily forgettable Command game.  All Midway games have a major weakness because of the one-dimensional situation: either the outgunned Americans get the jump on the Japanese or they don't.  Victory at Midway falls apart immediately on this point because the overgenerous air search system will almost always allow the Japanese to spot the Americans before the historical ambush can be pulled off.  To compensate, the Americans are given capabilities they simply didn't have historically.  The factors given to the air units are out to lunch.  All carrier aircraft are given a range of 200 miles, despite the fact that the American Devastators couldn't get that far and some Japanese planes could go nearly twice as far.  And giving the obsolete Devastators higher bombing factors than the excellent US Dauntless and Japanese Kate bombers just doesn't cut it.  The game's combat system works well enough (except for the rule about the defender firing first in surface combat), but the overall game is too simplified to be of any interest.  Although it runs a bit longer and has a few problems of its own, AH's Smithsonian Midway is a better choice overall.

RATING: 7
Solid offering with well done mechanics and a short playing time.  The situation is open-ended enough to allow some bluffing through the double blind mechanics yet the results feel historical in practice.  Because of the situation, one player or the other may receive a severe beating in a given game, but the overall balance seems quite fair.  Biggest problem may be replay value - it's hard to imagine playing this game five times, let alone ten or fifteen.

not bad double blind game. Bought it on recommmendation from acclaimed Marcus S. author of Solomon Sea. 

Combat system is little abstract to me and searches are less interesting then in Midway (smithsonian edition) but it is probably correct. I am still looking forward to acquire Solomon Sea one day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, fast, tense, low-complexity double-blind game with lots of narrative value.  Uses a simple combat system based on mercifully brief roll-to-hit resolutions.  I'm sure Flat Top is an excellent double-blind carrier game, but it is unlikely we will be convinced to play anything that lengthy as long as we have this little gem (or Stumptner's hopefully-to-be-reissued Solomon Sea, as a more direct comparison).

RATING: 10
Brilliant game, playable in 3 hours. All the speed and tension of the original Midway, plus ten times the history and chrome. Far more accurate combat outcomes than the overly bloody and overly search effective Smithsonian Midway.  Have seen the ambush pulled off, have seen the Americans squashed - no guarantee of outcomes. The 200 mile strike range is a compromise but works (despite other comments here, the Devastators were launched at close that range and no Japanese plane could reach double that with a combat payload).  The higher Devastator ratings are aggregate - they come about because one counter represents more aircraft, thus also representing that they are more vulnerable.  By far the best simple game on the battle.  

Note: this is based on the "Advanced" rules, but these are harmless to use.  As the rules say, anyone except a beginner should use them all.

This is a good, easy to learn Double-Blind system. It does a good job at having the right feel for a carrier game. It is all about finding the other guy and striking before he finds you.

Double-blind Midway game with simple enough rules that I can play with my 9 years old son, but still giving more realism than old Midway (AH): you have to ready your aircraft, allocate searches, support your landing with big guns...
Fast play, logical turn sequence and very fluent game (which is an achievement for double-blind). It also seems to allow for different tactics. Great!

... and of course, you've got the Yamato to play with or against!

Very nice, very tense. The double-blind rules are well implemented, and the game is simple. The dice killed me during the first play--two unopposed strikes from my air power on his carriers with zero hits. I lost Midway to the Japanese on turn 23 then lost the game 43 to 42.5!

I like this game even though I've only played it a few times. It's a lot like the old Battleship game only with planes.
Two separate maps for that true double blind feel. But this makes the game impossible to play solitare.
The counters look great. The map, well the map is sea! And a few islands. Not much you can do with that. 
A lot of fun searching. And a lot of tense moments. Kind of like what the real participants must have felt. Sets up and plays fast.

I like this more than [thing=118048][/thing], probably because I win more in this one, sure! :P Having a little bit of a luck element to the game (card drawing and flipping seals) isn't bad, though. You still have to make smart tactical choices and guess which cards come next.

+ The action/card selection mechanic is interesting and creates some agonizing decisions; Building as fast as you can to outpace your opponent is engaging and makes for a good dueling game.
- The seal-flipping is pretty weird and just feels like it's missing something.

This is a trading and building 2 player game. The card/ability drafting sounds like it doesn't really make sense for the game itself. And the flipping of coins/seals for "battling" sounds silly. I don't think I would be interested to play this.

Collect resources, convert resources, build stuff. Should be a usual boring euro but the way in which you select your action on a "noughts and crosses but with conflict" board makes this game something else. Really different. Very good two player game with a small table footprint.

A clever and interesting reduction of the larger Pillars board game, but some might be turned off by the token-flipping mechanic which you use to contest over one of the Advantage cards each round. Otherwise, it's rather straightforward, you place your Markers on the cards you want, which will earn or convert you resources, gold, or give you a special ability, and then you take those actions and build converted resources into parts of your structure. Rinse, repeat, until someone wins.

Tremendous distillation of the Pillars of the Earth world into a curious, unusual take on Tic Tac Toe, of sorts. 

Well worth it, gets to the table much more often than its big brother The Pillars of the Earth.

2 player semi-tableau laying game from Mr. Feld. I like how you can only use one row, column or diagonal of your 3 by 3 grid, but can upgrade those cards to better ones as the game goes on. Also, the coin flipping mechanic is a fun one. Highly recommended 2 player game, especially for couples.

One play and the first half was great... interesting choices for where to place markers and how to fight for the contested card.  Because we didn't know what was coming, we didn't really set ourselves up.  The second half of the game, especially the last round, was bad.  So many choices were obvious and it became a game of flip tons of seals to see who gets the contested card.  Hopefully, that was due to our inexperience and not just how this game works.  I finished 3rd part of the cathedral on the last turn, but my wife would have finished the 3rd part of the fortress on her turn.  I had the crown, so I won... it all came down to the flip of some coins.  That was lame and I could see it happening a lot in this game.  Hmmmmm.....

Tic tac toe and flip a coin.  That is what the game is.  How cool is that to make a game centered around those two items.  I found the game pretty cool with some tense decisions on what to do.  It's on the fence between a 6 and 7 for me depending on how other games play out (the speed, balance, etc.). After the first game you then get a feel for what is good, when.  I'm looking forward to playing this again.

I love the theme, components, and objective of the game but the randomness gets frustrating at times. All too often flipping the seals still just boils down to a 50/50 shot. The auction mechanic is interesting, though, and makes for some agonizing decisions.

UPDATE: With more plays, though the coin flipping can be annoying, I'm fine with it. Where the game falls apart is in what I feel is an honestly broken turn-order mechanic: going first for more than two rounds in a row is devastating, and if the Transfer of Power cards don't come out, there is no way to mitigate the situation. No exclusively-two-player game should ever enable a runaway leader.

This is a good game that is oddly guided by the random coin flips. The game would have been much better off with dice for the random factor.  The core of the game is very good, though.  There is a bit of a runaway leader problem.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable two player game that forces some, but not too much, conflict which is settled a little, but not too, randomly. There's not much of a learning curve but even second time through the decks saw us playing differently and I suspect the game would improve with experience. While some of the cards seemed a bit powerful, there are ways of compensating for that - but the building bonuses seemed a bit unbalanced as their winner takes all nature might cause a catch the leader issue. I wonder if half strength bonuses for the second player to complete would help?

I didn't realise it was a Feld - a very early one - as I don't think he'd made it onto my 'Designer to watch' radar until after this game was republished in English. There's promise, but this is much simpler than what we've come to think if as typically Feldian and there's little indication here of the fireworks to come.

RATING: 7
Feels very identifiably Stefan Feld, now that he's got enough games out there to have a brand identity. Clever, polished, interesting, not very thematic, a touch fiddly, somewhat dicey. I enjoyed it but it is pretty abstract, and for that reason not as engaging as the parent games, Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.

I dunno. I think it'll be good for a number of plays but very doubtful it's a long-term keeper.

A pretty cool race to be the first player to build his castle.  Both players are trying to accomplish the exact same thing, so it's all about who can take advantage of the best actions as well as benefit from a good dose of luck.

Some people are going to hate the "coin flips" that go toward determining which player gets a contested action, but I think it's a cool addition.  You can either invest in more coins to flip, or take your chances and hope luck is on your side with less coins.

Overall, a pretty slick and fresh feeling little two-player game.

A solid 2-player game that doesn't take too long and is another good implementation of the novel's theme.  Prior Phillip faces off against Bishop Waleran in an attempt to secure raw materials, craftsmen to turn them into resources, and money to build their respective buildings.

The downside is the silly "flipping seals" mechanism, which adds a random element that is likely to turn off some players (my partner hates that part).  The official no-flip variant sounds like a good compromise, and I want to try it.

Otherwise the game is nice, with the same quality of pieces you'd expect from Mayfair.  Overall a good game that I'll certainly want to play more, but it won't be my first choice for a 2-player game.

RATING: 6
Players compete in trying to be the first to build their medieval projects (castle and cathedral).  Played over twelve rounds, players perform two or three actions per round, "duelling" for the right to take the third action.  Actions consist of obtaining base resources, turning them into building materials, earning money, etc.  At the end of a round, stuff can be added to the buildings, possibly completing segments and earning rewards.  Solid game that plays well, does toss in a decision or two and seems to come down to tight finishes.  Not sure it's a permanent keeper, but it's entertaining enough at the moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like a few things about this game. The tic-tac-toe card selection forces some tough decisions, and I really like that.  I also like the seal mechanism.  However, the whole ends up being somewhat less than the sum of the parts here for me.  It doesn´t feel like the game really goes anywhere.  All the rules ambiguities (STILL not clarified by Mayfair, as far as I can tell) push me over the edge on this one - this game is not worth agonizing over what the cards really mean.  I think I would always go for Jambo over this one when in the mood for this flavor of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Collect raw materials, use workers to craft them into resources, and build the church -- the same basic theme as the parent game.   Essentially it's a two-player race.   There a couple of innovative mechanics here that make it work: (1) the card selection, using a 3x3 grid and (2) the coin flipping to compete for contested cards.  It's a neat idea and gives the game interesting decisions at every turn.   Money and seals are tight, and falling behind can be a problem, but with experience I think you can forsee and avoid that.   A decent, inexpensive, competitive 2-player game that should be fun for a handful of plays.

Love, love, love mini 'euro-ish' games that fit into these little boxes. You get all the bang with portability and speed.

Will play this over regular Pillars of Earth if given the choice.

One mini grumble; the coin tossing tie break seems so harsh. I've had a few games now where both players only had the 2/3 coin left, and it became a little silly when the "start player" gets to win the (what should be a 50-50 coin toss) 75% of the time. And while I get that grabbing the start player card is part of the game... it seems a bit unbalanced to put the red player into this position at the start.

Down rated because it's not quite my kind of thing, but people who like this kind of game will live this. it's a very tight efficiency engine with only 12 turns and 9 things to build. The flipping mechanism was cute and the game see-sawed, but my clear advantage was swept away on the final turn, more by chance than judgement. Holding the start marker turns out to be crucial. On balance, I enjoyed it, but would recommend you play before buying. Also, very language dependent. Nice bits.

RATING: 6.8
I like the 2-4 player board game, and I like this card game for 2.  Glad I have both.  

The selection of cards is unusual because there is always one card that will be in contention.

There is luck on cards that turn up, their arrangement, and the coin/seal flipping.  However some of the coin flipping luck can be over come by the purchase of coins/seals.  I do not enjoy games of luck, but this was okay.  I enjoyed it.

The always different arrangement of cards that results in a unique "board" each time, makes this game very re-playable.

I am looking forward to playing this one again.

Nice production values and some nice ideas for a two player game. But where's light, there's also darkness: While there are lots of possibilities to get your needed resources, most of thoses means exlude ore, which is harder to get and harder to refine to the bell or trellised gate. So the game is only about to get yourself ore and refine it and to hinder your opponent to do so. All other stuff you can do "by the way". Maybe you won't perceive this in your first game, but in a subsequent one. This lowers its replayability drastically.

Played 2+ There has to be more to this game than I am seeing! I find myself just not caring if I win and it all seems a bit pointless. The sentences on the text cards are not well written and the English Mayfair addition seems to contradict the translations from the French and German additions. It would help if I knew the book and so the characters meant something to me. Feb 2010

*UPDATE* On my 4th game and I finally got some pleasure out of this. I am just running with the Mayfair English text. I have now managed to put aside my disapointment at the poor wording on the cards. Played 2 games with my 16 year old daughter and it wasn't so bad. I still would advise folk not to bother buying a copy because of the lack of heart put into the game's development but if you do have it, stick in there and you might find some goodness after repeat plays. It is still nothing I would put in front of my partner. March 2010

Ingenious action-selection mechanic; I wish it were paired with a better game than "you must complete these 18 steps to win; can you do it faster than your opponent?"

Old and tired building theme, with a novel but luck-driven mechanic of choosing cards, involving some slightly annoying coin flipping. There is a welcome official variant that eliminates the flipping and the luck that comes from it, but luck of the draw remains and is also significant. Either way, it is a decent enough game, and the assimetric sides may help maintain the interest a little longer, but I think there is a severe imbalance in favor of the red player. The worst thing, though, is how Mayfair butchered the translation of several cards.

Stefan Feldet kérték fel, hogy a Katedrális könyvből készült játékok (The Pillars the Earth és World without end) kártyás verzióját. A játék tematikus, de mint igazi két személyes játék elég nagy benne a konfliktus. Pont az egyik legnagyobb probléma vele, hiszen a mesterségesen kialakított konfliktust korongok pöckölgetésével kell feloldani, vagyis ki tudja a korongot a nagyobb értékű oldalára dobni. Ennyire komoly játékhoz, ez komolytalan. Van olyan verzió, amely pénz fizetéséhez teszi függővé a korong nagyobb értékre való fordítását. Ez járhatóbb útnak tűnik. Mindenesetre német verzió mellé kell a kártyafordítás.

Weird mechanism involved where the first player claims any row on a 3x3 grid, and then the other player claims an intersecting row. Then the players "flip" tokens to see who wins it. The tokens are a resource, and there are a bunch of other ones you have to get, then convert to refined resources, then pay to use to build the castle.  Decent 2p game.

Roma and Pillars have a bastard child, though it looks much more like Roma and almost nothing like Pillars (or more aptly put it looks like Pillars and plays more like Roma, just a little of both really though). 

Standard fare, nothing stood out for me on this except maybe the luck but it is a short game. Works well enough but will stale quickly.

Crappy rules using the same terms to mean different things: are there really "neutral person text cards"? I don't think so, but the rules do.

Mistranslated cards! Missing text all over!

Let's get a proper translation on the "no-flip variant" while we're at it. Do all neutral tokens return to the bag/stack?

Good 2 player game. Some resource management + cube trading.

Pros:
- I like the "tic-tac-toe" action selection. It is really original and it creates a lot of conflict.
- I like how the first player is important. It is a resource to manage in itself.

Cons:
- It is possible to be really screwed if one of the rare "resource-converter" if out early and you don't have the correct resource to use it. 
- Not too sure about the flipping thing. I would ahve prefer a dice or drawing chits in a bag.

Good first impression! Nice clean rules, not too convoluted for a Feld game (he always seems to pace himself a bit with his two player games), and with a brilliant central mechanism that makes things very interesting for the first and very hard for the second player.

The cards that are only usable for one of the players introduce a bit of asymmetry, which is very welcome, too. I'd happily play this one more often to see whether it has staying power.

This is a moderately interesting game with some unique mechanics (flipping coins and playing on a pattern of cards). Ultimately, though I don't find it terribly engaging. Sometimes the cards work for you and sometimes they don't. There are also some oddly worded cards, although I did get the errata and that may have helped.

I liked the books and the game sounded neat, and the resource/building dynamic for 2 should be something my wife and I would like... but we really didn't enjoy the coin flip dynamic, or the way the cards are chosen each round. Just not our cup of tea, in the end.

For something similar that we like WAY better, Targi all the way.

This is a decent 2-player game that does a few things right, but in the end is nothing spectacular.

The way you select actions is pretty inventive. Feld always has some unique mechanism in his games, and this one is no exception. Every round has both players in an agonizing decision, and what's cool is that each player is thinking asymmetrically. The player laying their markers first has different things to think about than the player laying second. It's a very interesting action selection mechanism.

I am also a fan of how nice this game is. You aren't beaten down, and you can generally accomplish what you set out to do. It's a very rewarding experience.

The game is pretty stale however. It's not one to play everyday for weeks. It's a nice refresher every now and then.

I'm also not a big fan of the coin flipping mechanism. I get what Feld was going for, but it's just too painful for me to see all my hard work go to waste just because of a few bad flips. However, there are some easy house-rules to remedy this.

Overall, I've settled on a 6.5 for this game, and the BGG text is perfect for this rating: "Ok, will play if in the mood".

Not bad. The unclear text on the cards is frustrating at first. I recommend sleeving and using paste-ups. The flipping mechanic is a bit bizarre. I will try Feld's variant next time, which involves blind bidding with the flip tokens and money ($2 to use the high side of a flip token). Might be worth a 7 if the bidding variant works well.

Well, I like the mechanism for choosing cards, but there were not enough to keep it interesting enough.  There is an awful lot of luck in flipping the coins, and I pretty much wiped out my opponent in a few rounds so he could never recover.  The play through twice rule seemed to artificially stunt gameplay.  Looks ok.  Too bad it was also based on a lousy book.

A good, solid two player filler game. I haven't played the original game, so I can't really compare the two, but I like how this game approaches card drafting, auctioning, and resource management. What it brings to the table with the coin flipping and tic-tac-toe selection is a little gimmicky, but I enjoy it all the same. Not a lot of variation from game to game, but fun nonetheless.

Another of those annoyingly good little 2P Rio Grande games that populate the BGG Top 1000 by the dozen. Some people hate the chit-flipping mechanic, but I quite like it and it adds a little frivolousness to what could otherwise be oh-so-Stefan-Feld dryness.

I am concerned that our first two games have had a runaway leader obvious well before the end, although this might be an offspring of my ineptitude.

[i]I will never play this game again, what a horrible experience. I only played once, but my buddy told me the same thing happened when he played which is the rich get richer while you wallow in the dregs unable to accomplish anything. There is a huge advantage to going first and it is not always possible to get first player depending on how your opponent puts out their seals. Add to that some of the take that cards where you can basically stop someone from having any actions that whole round, no thanks. 

This might be the worst game I've ever played![/i]

A game of claiming action cards to get resource, convert them into building materials, and then allocating them to your building. First to complete their building wins. Standard concept. The claim mechanism provides the novelty. This turn's 9 action cards are laid out in a 3 by 3 grid. The start player claims any three in a row. The other player chooses any other 3 in a row, but 1 and only 1 must be one of the cards the start player chose. This restriction makes life interesting for the start player who may tradeoff their ideal set so as to restrict the other player from getting multiple good cards. The one card you're competing for gets decided by a coin flipping competition and this is where things start getting pear shaped. An unlucky flip sequence can overwhelm the game - one player runs short of coins, the coin-positive player denies the short player easy access to cards that allow acquisition of more coins, and your winning player continues to get an extra action each turn, plus use those extra coins for resource acquisition. The game offered some hope for replay because it was novel, but the slow pace of the action choosing / blocking, and the sour note struck by the coin luck, marks it down in the first instance.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: There is a lot to this game for a two player card game. You fight to gain resources and then turn the into building materials to build your building, all by fighting for cards on the board. The only annoying thing is that you must flip tokens when fighting for cards (of which only one is fought for) and since there are a lots of pieces on the table, the flipping gets in the way. Otherwise, the game has a lot of depth and the cards vary based on which character you chose (some cards are specific to the character). A nice, someone complex, game for two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a two-player game in which you're trying to produce enough resources to build all three sections of your structure (which are exactly the same, gameplay-wise).  The interesting this about this game is the card drafting--cards are arranged in a 3x3 grid, and players must choose 3 cards in a row that they want.  By rule, these "lines" must intersect, forcing a bid on the shared card.  Bidding is done with "coins", which are flipped to determine their value, and you can bid with as many coins as you've accumulated, flipping each one as you commit it.  It's an interesting concept, but really it's just another randomizing factor.  As for the game as a whole, it's fine, but it doesn't really stand out.

Disappointing;  Some interesting mechanical ideas, but ultimately this game fails & is borderline broken.  Too many turns with nothing to do, imbalanced cards for one team, game swinging luck of the draw issues & general frustration with having to take useless cards in a line (particularly in the late game).  My one game I had a very strong lead, only needing one card to come up (a resource converter).  It did not, making me go through 3 rounds of nothing to do & ultimately losing.

Builders Dual is a great 2p game with a very euro feel.  Once you have a feel for the cards and the pacing of the game it can become a very tight contest with both players trying to maintain advantages a on multiple fronts. You have to try and keep your eye on gathering resources, converting resources, implementing resources, collecting money, and trying to maintain a seals to win your duals with.  Trying to balance all theses makes the momentum swing back and forth, and forces some tricky decisions.  The two sides are a little asymmetrical, but balanced, so that makes the game a touch more interesting.
If you like euro style games and are looking for something to play with two then this a good choice.

I do like this game and the card-grid action selection system but I am terribly annoyed by the starting player mechanic, not only because I was on the receiving end of the crapstick, but I just made a game that should be all about subtle and fine decisions way to imbalanced. The contested cards should be decided by a Euro-mechanic, such as secret bidding and not through sheer chance and luck. That can be very frustrating for both players because even If I would win the game, I'd rather not win it by chance and disadvantages on the side of my opponent. The theme is neat, but more or less just an excuse for sophisticated artwork which is fair and square in my book and If you like World Without End (or Pillars of the Earth) you will enjoy this game. Not as deep and engaging as its namesakes but then again, it plays quicker and is easy to carry.

This two players game has an interesting mix of mechanics that I've never really seen before.  The object is to be the first to build your cathedral.  You do this by spreading you authority to various place and people but the catch is that you must always have one action that is in conflict.  This spot must be battled for.  Thematically this make great sense as in Pillars of the Earth the two characters are consistently in conflict in a distance way.  One mechanic that might turn people away is the battles are determined by flipping double-sided coins.  The random flips can really be brutal  and just kind of clunky to do on the game table but I really thought this was a unique play on battle.  Overall a really good two player game that isn't anything like its big brother nor as satisfying but somehow thematically is more in the spirit of the tale.

I was apprehensive about this game, mostly due to the flipping of the seals, and well I certainly will explore alternatives but otherwise I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable a 2p this is.

It's rather light and is a bit uneven in flow but it plays fast and allows to do a couple of games switching sides, which helps alleviate the relative unbalance of the 2 sides. I still don't think Feld shines particularly with his asymmetrical designs but this one feels better than Roma.

Easy to learn. Easy to play. Nice little decisions to be made every round - go for resources, do you need to block, etc. The grid mechanic is simple and effective. Flipping the counters with their two known values is a good idea too. I like how you can invest in more counters. Action cards spice things up a bit. Money, goods, counters are all in short supply, but not frustratingly so. All in all a pleasant game that doesn't play too nasty and comes in comfortably under an hour. I like it for what it's trying to be - nothing more, nothing less. The wife likes it too.

This is a fantastic euro game.  It delivers all of the impact of a full sized euro game in a package that is perfect for a couple.  The "tic tac toe" board and coin flips are very original and incredible mechanics.  Looking forward to this one getting many more plays.

One play - after botching the first go around, Jen and I figured out what we did wrong and re-played.  She loves Pillars and she also liked this game.

I like the tic-tac-toe mechanic and the need to balance money with flip tokens.

Nice little two player ditty. Lay out some cards, claim a few, fight over one.  The cards give you resources, money, special powers, upgrades and challenging power.  Very straight forward, but it forces some very clever decisions.  Expect the layout to valuated and pondered over many, many  times.  Perhaps more interesting than the standard pillars, because of the kooky set up.

That said, luck is really more important than skill.  If the cards lay out well for you, it is a boon, if not, then there really isn't much worthwhile you can do, then on top of that if you need to challenge people for a much needed card, the coin flips can really be very swingy. 

I think that the red player has a significant advantage, not just that they control the first player token, but their special cards seem more powerful (including an obnoxious destructive card that can effectively eliminate 4 turns worth of your game for free).  If I were to play this again I'd encourage the blue player to go first.

Interesting set-collection, resource-conversion, action selection type of game. The cycling through the card decks, the coin-flip bidding, and bid chip economy, the tension in choosing a row/column/diagonal ... it's all pretty cool even though I'm not exactly crazy about all that coin flipping! 

There are 2 decks of cards: go through them A-B-A-B-game end. Each deck lasts 3 rounds. Each round, you create a 3x3 grid of cards and player choose a row, column, or diagonal -- there must be exactly one overlap. The overlap is resolved by flipping bidding counters (0-5 on one side, 5-0 on the other; sums to 5 each): each player has their own supply and they alternate adding to their bid until either passing or exceeding the sum of the other player. The winner loses all their neutral counters; loser may keep one -- they go to a stack in the center (game starts with stack of 4). Then, in player order, resolve your cards in any order. Cards give you money or resources, allow you to convert resources to building materials, or a variety of powers (e.g., use an unclaimed card, save for later 1-time use, become start player, etc.). After cards are used, players may pay 2-6-12 gold to add 1-2-3 building materials to one of their 3 building cards. The first player to finish a building section (each requires 3 different materials) gets a bonus (money, bidding chips, or free conversions). The first player to finish all 3 sections wins the game!

--- No Flip Variant ---
Bid with the lower number side of your chip for free, or the higher side for 2 gold.

This isn't that bad but it certainly isn't that good either.  The game is played by laying out a 3x3 grid of cards, having players pick one row, column, or diagonal line of cards and competing over the one card they intersect on and using the 2-3 they end up with before repeating this process until they collect enough resources to build their building.

It is an interesting concept not bad for a quick filler.  Unfortunately the main interaction mechanic in the game is flipping a coin.  Annoying, uninteresting, and devoid of any real skill (There was one instance where I flipped 3 coins and still lost to someone who flipped 1).  Flipping coins as a MAIN game mechanic is not a good way to attract gamers Mr. Feld.  I like your dice-rolling mechanics because there are usually bountiful ways to manipulate and use the results but big swing and a miss on the coin flipping.

The distribution in the cards is also a bit concerning.  The turn order only changes when competing on a certain card, which may only come up once every 3 rounds and may be in an awful position in the grid.  In fact, your ability to get what you need when you need it always has too many random factors associated with it.  When will it come out, will your opponent pick in a way that lets you get it, will it be placed beneficially in the grid?

I would play this to fill 20 minutes but wouldn't be too excited about it.

Stefan Feld is one of my favorite designers but this game really doesn't work for me. It's no tense at all because results are often very obvious. Plus it has a characteristic that I really don't like which is that players should know the cards that exist is each deck to play well. I've played once and when I wanted to build things the cards that I needed for that were not available in that turn. I had the feeling that I really needed to guess too much to actually do something useful. 
Components are very good.

Obviously, the goal was to create a 2-player-game on the Kosmos' "Pillars of the Earth"-license.
Here, Stefan Feld has succeeded.
The game came out a bit too luck-dependant, however. Not only the flipping of seals (which everybody is commenting about), but also the random setup of the 9 cards that make up a round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like the theory of flipping the seals.  It's a nice thing to mitigate.  That's actually the best part of this game.  The rest of it was much more boring.  

But hey, it's part of the Feld collection so it's not going anywhere.

Pretty good two player race to complete a building.  There are some interesting twists to the games where you are required to have conflict with your opponent once a turn.  The token flips are kind of fun and there is a definite strategy of abusing those to get the game back in balance if you fall behind.

One of those games we have picked up over the years at the RenFaire that happens every year outside our building (normally we had been getting stuff like Carcassonne expansions). With this I have fallen in love the Kosmo 2-player series of games and we have really enjoyed it. It was in heavy rotation when we took it with us for a long weekend in VT (packs down to almost nothing when out of the box) and I suspect that I would enjoy the full size game less.

RATING: 5.8
It took me a while to see the fun in this; when played with a mash of the original rules (flipping seals) and the alternative rules (paying 2 to use the higher value seal) there seems to be the perfect balance between luck and being able to buy your way out of trouble.

A nice, gentle, 2 player Euro-semi filler.

Update: This really is just too gentle for my tastes. It's non-offensive to the point of being more than a little dull.

Rating down from 7.1 to 5.8.

Some nice elements, but pretty boring in the end.

I hate the coin tossing! I tried playing with the variant as well (paying 2 coins to use the stronger side of the seal), but it turned out to be pointless as well. You need to hold on to your money, so many times just personal seals were used and the first one to bid won. Maybe you could get better at this and find ways to afford using the seals more, but I'm not sure I like this game enough to keep trying.

Really neat mechanism which makes for some great puzzly, tactical choices.  I don't care much for the fact that you only need two of each type of good, and any extra you are able to acquire is wasted.

The game is really interesting the first ~3 times you play, then it loses its charm.

Note: this is my rating for the game using the designer's variant of paying two coins to use the high side of the bidding tiles; the game using the coin-flip method would score much lower in my book. I like the mechanism of placing the seals to select cards, but there is a downside: my wife doesn't like that the selection process mandates conflict over one card each turn. The game definitely trades depth and scope in exchange for very quick play. At the moment, that's a feature I like in Pillars of the Earth: Builders Duel. However, time will tell whether the lack of depth hurts replayability. Update: I now have some balance concerns and am coming to believe that red has a large advantage over blue, not only being the start player (a big edge) to begin, but also having better cards. For example, blue has a card that lets him take a raw resource, upgrade it and place it into his cathedral all at once. This costs two gold and one bidding token. Red has a card that lets him remove a piece from blue's cathedral, revert it back to a basic material and return it to blue's un-acquired pool. In other words, it does the exact opposite of what blue's card does. That's fair enough. But red's cost for doing this nasty spot of damage? Zero. Zip. Zilch. Huh? The existence of this one card alone makes a blue victory extremely difficult. In the end, while I like some of what's happening here, Pillars: Builders Duel ends up close but no cigar. A near miss that's interesting but not compelling or balanced enough to break into my two-player game rotation.

RATING: 7.5
Played twice so far. Good, fun game with a unique mechanic of card selection. The red player seems to have an advantage with the first player token at the beginning, but the game seems to still play closely. Very nice components, plays pretty quickly, some decisions to be made, but is not too heavy, so it should be a good spouse game.

PotE Builders Duel may be one of the best small-box Euros for two.  You can complain about the flipping of the coins if you like, but it is a unique randomizer that adds ACTION.  Combined with the tic-tac-toe card war, the result is a refreshingly unique experience.

I'm a Feld fan, really I am, so I wanted this to be cool and reading the rules knew it was going to be. Finally a neat little euro game for two that wasn't going to be over in 15 minutes either. 

It really is a cool system in place here but it just feels like it wasn't properly play tested. There are wayyyyyy too many options for problems in this game. Twice in my game there was a situation where a single player had 9 cards to look at and literally none of them had any actions that would do anything for the player...and we are talking with more than half the game yet to go. Also when one player gets down to only having their private bidding token left the start player basically doesn't have to expend any tokens as they will nearly always win.

All this adds up to neat ideas in concept that feels like it just wasn't really tried out very well.

There are a couple of interesting things going on in this game.  The tic-tac-toe challenge of placing your markers creates some interesting choices, especially as you near the end of the game and start placing to prevent your opponent from taking a crucial card, as opposed to taking something that would help you outright.  Weighing those options can make for an interesting tension in the game.  The coin-flipping mechanism is pretty cool, too, but both of those "interesting things" have downsides, too, mainly in the luck of both of them.  Sometimes the best possible card will be in a place you can't block from your opponent, or worse, the one card you need can be placed out of your reach if you're not placing first, and the coin-flipping mechanism is just far too random for this sort of game.  Sure, there are methods to alleviate the luck in both aspects of the game, but having to spend time and resources to do that takes too much away from what should be a decent game of building.  It just doesn't thrill me.

Two player medieval card drafting game of goods conversion to be the first builder to respectively complete the fortress or the cathedral. Game play features a 3x3 actions tableau with tic-tac-toe row selection and coin flipping to resolve the contested action space--the duel.  It is amusing to see how many old classic game mechanics can be retread into contemporary board game design. The start of each round could be considered AP inducing but it is an important decision to make and you need to understand the function and position of each of the card actions.  AP for some, heart of the challenge for others.  The coin flipping dual with the permanent and temporary seals with differing values on each side does work and provides interesting decision making points on whether to raise or fold and which seals to flip.  But, bad luck is punished even with the consolation prize.  Though it has similar box art and thematic objective it is in not in any way a two player variant of the original worker placement version.

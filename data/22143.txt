Eastfront is a wonderful game.  It captures the size and scope of the Eastern Front just right!  It doesn't try to minimize the game with 20 pieces and a small map.  At the same time, you don't get some OCS monster with 10 maps and 3,000 counters.
I love the HQ system much better than the card system of Rommel and the options you have to blitz, mobilize and utilize air power.
The scenarios are well done and let you play the campaign in bite sized pieces.
I'm not into the whole Front-based WWII system, but if you are, the idea of putting all of them together is a good idea for the monster gamers.
The combat system is simple without being too simple, which is true for the entire game.

A fantastic wargame that is just small enough to allow maneuvering of armies, yet large enough to have a grand scale of the entire Eastern Front. A simple yet elegant fog of war system complements a supply system that is abstracted enough to not be unwieldy. 

Part of what makes Eastfront so fun is the asymmetrical yet balanced nature of the game. The German Heer is a force to be reckoned with, as the entire force is overall much more powerful than the Red Army, yet more expensive to replace losses. This leads to a force that tends to fight a war of maneuver that pressures opponents by blasting holes in the game. The Red Army is technically inferior in overall strength compared to the Heer (with roughly 1/3rd of their blocks being the same quality [4 strength compared to 3] as the Heer) but their replacement costs are half of what the German uses! This leads to an army that excels in grind-it-out battles of attrition, but also can play some maneuver warfare if the Heer leaves itself open to such an action. 

In addition to this, the game shows a very heavy back-and-forth action. In the Summer, the Germans gear up to make a massive offensive for an objective (Typically Moscow or the precious oil fields in the Caucasus). Around October, the mud sets in and soon the temperatures start dropping.
In the winter, the German army is always handicapped in the snowy weather while the Russians are barely phased by it (the Winter of 1941 is especially bad). This allows a Russian counter-offensive that aims to reclaim land lost in the previous Summer season. 

Eastfront is typically considered inferior to its younger brother Westfront, but many players (including the designer I believe) have been stated to prefer Westfront - so it's mostly preference.

11/10 would lose entire Army to encirclement again

Pretty good game but the first game we played ended in a stalemate. The resources we kept ended up being used for a punch for punch session. 

End game was not what it seems. Got to play it a few more times.

RATING: 10
Someday I will not suck at this.  (6/20/11 Finally, I beat Peter, a newbie at this, after several games of being schooled by experienced players.)

I love block games with hidden information.  It makes games much less predictable and adds to the tension.  A big board that requires a large table to play.  The board measures 34x44, it you were to combine it with the Westfront board it would be 66x45.  A medium complexity game.  

I really enjoy the fact that there seem to be a lot of approaches vs. one true path to victory.  Despite what some people think, the 'blob' strategy is not invincible.  Playing a campaign that lasts longer than 6 months leads to both sides getting to be aggressive.  Woe to the German player who is overextended with his HQs run down after the first 6 months of Barbarossa when winter hits.  That's when the soviet player really gets to make hay.

This game really does have a learning curve to it.  On one hand it does make the game very enjoyable, the downside is that different levels of experience really tell.

If I had one thing that I don't like is the marks on the board to show where the dividing lines between the armies are for the historical setup are virtually unnoticeable.  If you're playing with someone who has played before it can be explained fairly clearly otherwise it's difficult to figure out.

RATING: 9
A really great game of the fighting in the east front. The scale is sort of grand operational: there's lots of room for maneuvering and worrying about supply lines, but you still have to concern yourself a little with the big picture (though this is more the case in the complete eurofront, here there's only production and long term objectives).  Playing time reflects this but achieves a nice balance: while the full campaign should be around 30-40 hours (which is pretty much inevitable given the scale of the game), a single six month scenario can be played in an evening.

The HQ mechanic is quite clever and, coupled with the fog of war from the blocks, really forces you to plan and pace your offensives carefully: you can use up to 4 steps of an HQ in a month but can only rebuild one... Supply lines, tank impact and the importance of rivers are all nicely modeled too; the game covers plenty but the rules are very manageable, with the core (command, supply, movement, combat) being relatively simple.

RATING: 8
I like block games and I think Eastfront is probably the best.  But I'm a rules perfectionist, I like the comfort of knowing my opponent is inspecting my play to make sure I'm not screwing anything up.  For this reason I hardly ever want to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lots of very interesting decisions.  This game is a very in-depth study of supply in warfare.  Managing HQ supply in good weather and bad and knowing when to blitz and when your opponent can blitz is key. Managing your HQ provides a rich gaming atmosphere I have not experienced in other games.  The Soviets in this game are deceptively weak.  You might think you have them on the ropes and then the Soviet steam roller ruins your best laid plans.  You have a huge detailed map to play on that gives the game the necessary epic feel befitting an Eastern Front game.  The down side is the long playing time and the fact that the game doesn't allow for a quick victory.  I house rule the negatives. Great game.

Initial Impression: Wow! This is a great game with wonderful production value. The rules are simple enough to teach quickly and there's only a little bit of chrome. However, the implications of the rules are similar to those of Napoleon's Triumph in that everything is not always as it seems. I'm loving my initial plays of this game and plan to explore it alot more.

The series of games is amazing, even with all the limitations of the block game design.  Eastfront does a great job of simulation the supply and logistical challenges faced by the Axis during Barbarossa.  The other scenarios give room for some sneakiness during the set-up, but don't let the "fog of war" promo fool you.  Seriously, just where would you put your Panzers IV's or T-34's?

Great game! The best of its kind as far as I'm concerned! Perhaps the only thing missing is the possibility to " buy"  fortifications. E.g. in the Kursk scenario-which was heavily fortified by the Soviets- this is not reflected at all. Even some kind of special rule might have addressed this. Other than that it's superb! Relatively easy to master ( apart from perhaps the supply rules and when and how you can or cannot enter/leave a hex)and very historically accurate!

Rating after first play of Kursk Scenario. Will update further. My favourite era and front, haven't played an Eastern front game since Russian Campaign way back so very pleasantly surprised by the elegant balance and innovation in this design so far. Update: Easily my best wargame now. As a historian of this period this game manages to recreate the Eastern front perfectly which no other game has been able to. At the core is the HQ system which is an incredible component of a genius game design.

The same great game we know and love, in a new and expanded format. Who should upgrade the EFI to EFII, and who should pick up a cheap EFI instead of a shiny new EFII?

First, the games are functionally almost the same. EFII has a few map upgrades, but the differences are pretty minor (the major change as that mountain near Moscow is now a hill). EFII has Turkey and Finland, but these are used only in conjuction with EuroFront. EFII also includes all the relevant area from EFI's VolgaFront expansion, and EFI + VolgaFront is not that much less than EFII.

So if you have no aspiration to ever play a combined EastFront/WestFront game, or a EuroFront game, you can think about either EFI or EFII.

The EFI map footprint is much smaller. You can play EFI on a small table. EFII need something more substantial.

The EFII map is definitely clearer than EFI. The EFI map is more artistic, the EFII map more functional. It's not a big deal, but EFII is definitely easier to play on.

In general, I think if you're only intersted in playing EastFront, and have no interest in any sort of combined game, EFI is the better value.

But, having said that, don't underestimate the appeal of EuroFront. A combined EastFront + WestFront game is not unplayable. A 4-player one-year scenario does not take very much longer to play than a 2-player one-year scenario, and can be a lot of fun.

One major unknown is whether the new EuroFront will include anything to incorporate the new map areas (particularly Scandinavia) into run-of-the-mill EastFront-only games. Having blocks and rules to incorporate the far north would add some value to the larger map area in EFII that you're not getting mileage out of currently. We won't be able to say until EuroFront II ships.

UPDATE: Sadly, EuFII does not include rules to link the Finns into EFII scenarios. Sort of a bummer.

Epic but streamlined. Lots of game but plenty of simulation. Good stuff. While I think I like the GAME of Rommel in the Desert better, I like the massiveness - map, story arc, OB - of Eastfront.

Soviets and Barbarossa:
- This is the art of backing up gracefully. Orderly withdrawal is the name of the game.
- The Dnepr and the woods north make for a damn fine line. Watch out when the river freezes though.
- It is better to have depth than toughness; your guys are going to die no matter what, so you'd rather have two short battles than one.
- Cadres are crucial to plugging gaps and slowing down the onslaught. But you burn a lot of HQ getting them in place and a lot of PPs on them.
- Cadres are also good to get on the board so you can bump them when you have a chance.
- Be as static as is sane; HQ steps and cadres are EXPENSIVE.
- Don't be too hasty bringing up your reserves with Stavka; the frontline comes back to you in a hurry.
- Stretch, don't break in the South; better to let the Axis have the flank then to get cut off. Importantly, it stretches his line and sets you up for a breakthrough.
- Snow isn't all good for the Soviets; rivers aren't as great a defense and the marshes you were counting on to stem the tide become a bit porous.

RATING: 8
Very good operational game about Eastern Front. Easy to read and understand rules, no fiddly gameplay. Core East Front aspects well shown. Great replayability due to setup and force composition choices and of course luck factor. Fog of War helps to achieve element of surprise in our planning.
Half-year or yearly scenarios recommended. Campaign game is hard to play live.
One minor issue - too large blocks, too small hexes. Smaller blocks (used by GMT in Triumph&Tragedy for example) would be perfect.

RATING: 7.6
This is a more abstract-theatre-level game of the Eastern Front in WWII with much less fiddling than lots of other games on this topic.  First play of the Kursk (S'43) scenario took 6 hours, as advertised.  It is definitely not a historical treatment of the West Front in its minutiae, but can be a good game for simulating the broad strokes of the campaign.  Lots of dice rolling.  A streak of bad luck can break you.

I do wonder about how the handicap modifiers were calculated and whether the results over time have proven these numbers accurate.

The biggest downside is that I still don't have a table big enough to set up the larger map in my house.

SUMMARY: The same game as the first edition.

I REALLY love East Front (which I rate a straight 10), and I hate to give only a 6, but I would like to voice my dissatisfaction with the sloppiness regarding the proofreading and quality for the 2nd edition releases of the Front games. For this price and the amount of time the original game had already been released, I had expected a much better quality.

Just take a look at all the typos and errata that have been posted so far in the CG forum and on BGG. Then take the missing EuFII diplomacy markers, no color rulebook, rules inconsistencies (mud repulses, move of HQs in Blitz Movement), etc...

An amazing block game for the eastern front.  The idea of HQ command steps dictating the range of control is an excellent mechanic that allows for a realistic and fun modelling of this conflict.  The supply system helps drive the axis of advance.  And the replacment and reinforcement phase steer both sides towards strategic objectives.  I will play this game anytime.

Un "filler" estratégico de la WW2 xD ... se aprende rápidamente, además es muy ágil de jugar, sin embargo no es un juego evidente, en realidad hay que pensar bien lo que quieres hacer, ir con cuidado y planificando con vista al futuro. Como punto negativo ... los dados, dados, dados y más dados, quizá demasiado caótico en este aspecto, aunque se tiran tal cantidad de dados que finalmente la suerte se diluye entre la mala suerte. Lo mejor, es el estratégico más jugable que he probado, y el manual es un ejemplo de cómo se debe explicar un juego.

I own many games and rarely ever get the chance to play any - however if one does come off the shelf when time allows its this one.  I have never got passed Spring 1943 and always played Russia (my brother insists on being German!) but have always enjoyed it immensely.  I love the fog of war element and the way command units work - never seeming to have even half the command points for the moves I wish to make ! A classic game and will no doubt stand the test of time.

This game would be worth every penny for the Barbarossa scenario alone. I played it 5 times already and didn't even want to look at the other scenarios yet, it is that good!

It amazes me how much depth can come from such a simple system. An incredible achievement in wargame design.

My Favorite:
Strategic - WWII Eastern Front - Easy/Medium

Plus:
-The perfect balance between playbility and strategic simulation executed by a straight foward and comprehensive system
-The Fog of war really shines here (Oops a 4 strength SS Panzer...)
-Superb research
-Superb playability
-Superb replay value
-Superb game quality
-Focusses on the strategy, many East Front games getting bogged down in chrome, additional rules and  and complex supply, movement etc. Here it is straight forward yet comprehensive.

-Minus:
If you have two German HQ Operating together within their range (e.g. put AGC and AGN togehter changing while attacking, there is no way the Russians are able to stop the Germans. 2nd edition rules deal with this. 
-Not very evocative due to the lack of chrome and the blocks; it is all about strategy and HQ steps rather than reflecting special units / leaders etc. 
-Map is huge, if space is an issue get EastFront I instead (I have both)

Should you upgrade?
1) IMO you should only upgrade if you play EuroFront as well or,
2) If space is not an issue, do upgrade as you have the Urals and Turkey with it. Just don't get bogged down East of Voronezh....

What more do you want in a wargame? This one has it all. Quite easy to learn, intuitive mechanisms, quick gameplay, plenty of scenario's and well researched. The new map is great and this is just what the game needed: a little pimp. (if you lack space, simply take the old map).

A solid game doesn't need many changes and this one proved to be right from the start. Redesigning the map was imo a great idea as now you don't need to tangram around with the maps if you want to play EuroFront. 

Imo one of the best and most fun wargame that have ever been produced.

Wonderful game with tons of replayability.

Feels like an improved and deeper version of one of Avalon Hill's most classic games: The Russian Campaign. But the combat and logistic mechanics are much more realistic. And the multiple scenarios can provide a great gaming experience in just 4-6 hours.

6 plays so far. EastFront uses the same basic system as Rommel in the Desert, but with a different mechanism for determining block activation. EastFront is more complex, with a higher number of terrain and unit types and the additional of rules for air warfare and weather. Nevertheless, EastFront is just as playable as its older sibling and even better themed. But,  EastFront is by far the better game as it does not suffer from the supply cards effects that can sometimes marr Rommel. EastFront boasts a good mix of scenarios as well as a campaign game option. Without doubt, EastFront is the crème de la crème of block wargames!

Very interested in this one. I like the block war games as they are very modern life friendly and I like the fog-of-war in the system.

RATING: 9
One of the great games, with the bonus that a six-month scenario makes a good evening's play while the whole war can be a long-lasting project.  Terrific fun for both sides (well, except for the Germans in the last scenario).

RATING: 10
Still get this out 25 years after the original EFI came out (which has to justify a 10 ranking). For me if I want a hardcore wargame this remains the best balance of playability, simulation and challenge. 
And the ongoing support from the designer (thanks Craig) over so many years means the rules are comprehensive and bug-free.
Takes some time to learn how to play either side effectively, in particular to use the HQ's to get the most from them. But once learnt the choices, even for the side on the strategic defensive, keep me coming back time after time.
Also worth noting that Vassal is ideal for this game - each player has a lot to do in a turn, and can do it all before handing the file across. Whereas FtF you can be waiting a while for your opponent to take their turn, particularly if relatively inexperienced.
Worth noting that like all block games you have to trust your opponent, and of course spotting genuine errors can be impossible. So I can imagine this type of game won't be for all wargamers.

RATING: 8
Excellent block game. One can see how designer was able to model many different things with such simple rulebook.

But as big fan of FAB I missing assets or something to spice it little bit up.

Also I am not entirely happy with heavy abstraction of air forces.

But otherwise I like it very much especially in comparison to Blocks in the East/West system which is pretty hyped these days.

I would say that this is one of those clasic games.

I own the earlier version and have now played the Barbarossa scenario. WOW! I think this is a great game.

For such a big game with a thick rule book, this is amazingly accessible. The system is very clean, the mechanics make sense, you have a lot of meaningful choices and most importantly, it's fun. It's challenging, too, but in a good way, not a Eurogame spreadsheet way.

It's quite a remarkable accomplishment for a game to be this sprawling and also so playable. This could become one of my favorite games if I could find room and an opponent to play it.

This is one of the best games I ever played. You really have to plan and think all the time, if you stop doing that you´re loosing. The combat system is very easy so it lets you focus on maneuvering your units. Planning and strategy is highly rewarded, if done well.

RATING: 9
Has to be the most simple of the deep wargames games I own (great credit to designer) .  The mechanics of the game are straightforward, with not much in the way of exceptions.  The variety of units and their capabilities, the constant effort to ensure that your units don't get put out of supply (while trying to put your opponent's out of supply), and the constant drain on your critical HQ units while pushing on different sections of the front in the pursuit of resource objectives, makes this game a real brain-burner.  The scenarios suffer slightly because of the gamey tactics that can be used in an attempt to gain last-turn VPs.  The campaign game would really be the way to go, if you have the time.  In any case though, it is a very fun and deep game.

RATING: 9
Rules are surprisingly clear and simple for such a big game. It's the strategies that are hard too master, not the rules. The later scenarios can get bogged down, but Barbarossa is always very exciting. Unfortunately, the space and time requirements mean this game sees little play outside of VASSAL.

Update: Ranking improved to 9 since I found an FTF opponent. Great fun.

EastFront II covers what I see as one of the most interesting military campaigns in the history. The game oozes with strategy, tactics and possibilities for nasty bluffing. The fog-of-war makes each game exciting as you are never sure where your enemy has placed his strongest units. Attacking is gambling. However, you do most damage by cutting enemy units out of their supply network. That hurts! The downside is that the game does not encourage historical play.

A step above dreadful.  Far too abstract and rewarding of a-historical behavior.  No where near a simulation - just a game that forces you to play the system, not really fight your opponent or fight with your army.  Felt like I could have painted a swastika on a black checker and a red star on a red checker, played checkers, and had the same feeling of fighting on the East Front.

An update to East Front. Inconveniently sized, but contains the Volga Front map. And Egypt. And Norway.

Block gaming is really what hex wargames always should have been, low counter density with a board that doesn't involve the fiddly mess. This is an excellent example of that, lighter on rules than some hex wargames but with a quite nuanced use of dice hits. The game gives a great feeling of the difficulties of fuel, changing weather, an asymetric forces on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately, while its versimilitude is impressive I suspect its realism is greatly hampered by the combined 3C/Supply system which poses some fundementally absurd suggestions (putting more supply trucks on a road makes infantry walk faster!) and then obliges you to follow them to match the speed of the German advance. I've recently downgraded the game because its victory conditions are so badly thought out. As soon as you start to play the game rather than the scenario it breaks down (especially Winter '41 but even the strongest scenario, Barbarossa).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Block-Strategiespiel um die Operation Barbarossa mit verhältnismäßig klaren Regeln, die es nach ein wenig Einarbeitungszeit ermöglichen, wesentliche Teile des Russlandfeldzuges (oder diesen in seiner Gesamtheit) nachzuspielen. Zeitintensiv und nicht zu detailverliebt.

Classic block wargame! The rules are longish but mostly clear, although various annoying little details and unclear things exist so it's well worth browsing the FAQ.

Cool that you can play a 6-month scenario in one session, or start in one scenario and continue to some later scenario, even a full campaign from first to last scenarios.

I think something mystical (for the lack of a better word) is happening to me.  As a gammer girl I think it's a bit odd to find myself "wanting" to play wargames.  In fact, I don't really like any of the real life components of war.  That is to say, guns, tanks, military operations etc just don't appeal to me. Nonetheless as I become more ingrossed in the Board Game Hobby I find myself migrating to more strategic and tactical games. Like Chess, wargames (or at least from my niave perspective) seem to offer a level of complexity that you can't get from other games.  U suppose the true test will be if I still feel this way after I unbox and play this game... we'll see.

One of the best Eastern front games out there. Clean, intuitive mechanics. The fog of war provided by the blocks adds a lot of tension to the game as each side attempts breakthroughs and encirclements.

This is the game that demoted Europe Engulfed. It takes dedication; you'll have to set aside regularly scheduled playing time, rules study time, and a big table.

RATING: 10
I've played Europe Engulfed a bit, which was inspired by Eastfront.  I recently acquired Eastfront II.  Things I like better about Eastfront:

Hex-map (as opposed to areas) with strict stacking limits.  Much more granular and gives the opportunity for maneuver to be decisive.  During the first two summers, the Soviets can expect to be losing steps to supply attrition every single turn; this is not the case in EE.  Likewise, double envelopments are a regular feature of German operations.

The smaller time-scale (turns 1/4 as long as EE).  Now four turns of Eastfront and one turn of EE might simulate the same stuff, but the Eastfront version will be far more interesting, with much more maneuver.

It also seems to me that Eastfront encourages more historical strategies.  In my experience with EE, it seems that the Soviets end up turtling in a few places (Grozny, Moscow, Gorky) rather than trying to maintain a continuous front line.

RATING: N/A
[Columbia Games 06 edition] {WWII, War; block, dice-rolling, secret-unit-deployment, scenario} EastFront II is a very nice war game.  The combat and supply systems are comparatively simple and intuitive.  There are enough scenarios to achieve good replay value. The map density is appropriate - neither too dense nor too loose.  It deserves the high rating and popularity.

gets a nine because the hexes were made smaller so the map could get bigger. and they took the information off the counter. I liked it there. Made for faster set up. You watch East Front I will be worth more than II one day for these very reasons. But I am going to get the rest of the over priced set!

One of my favorite games of all time.  The design and mechanics are so element, and I've yet to play a strategic game on the EastFront that emulates the conflict so well.  It's extremely tense, engaging, and down-right fun!  I will always be up for a match of EFII.

Even though the new map is stunningly beautiful and really gives you a nice understanding of the vastness of the Soviet Union, it's too big. I can't play EastFront at home any more...
However the map issue is somewhat compensated by the fact that the rules have been streamlined and work even better than before.

This is a game that a LOT of old school wargamers recommended to me. Incredibly well done, elegant supply system, easy rules for interesting combat.  Different scenarios give you the option to reenact history or change it. My favourite rule book for a wargame of this complexity.  I'm not a huge old school wargame fan but I'll make an exception for this.  Eastfront is perfect for what it is, even though I typically prefer CDG wargames.

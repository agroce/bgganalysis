Fun!  Can go on a bit longer than needed if the cards come out in the wrong order.  A fair few subtleties in play that become more apparent as you play.  Obviously a bit like Bang!  but not too much.

A Bang! type game that I like better than Bang!. Perhaps it's because I like roman themed games better than wild west themes. I wouldn't purchase both those... that would seem redundant to me.

RATING: 5
Somewhat reminiscent of [GAMEID=3955] with all hidden goals except for one revealed.  Very random.  Loads of player interaction.  Lots of give and take with very little mitigation.

A little interesting in how it plays out except for one key point.  In order to be able to select the three cards, you must accept a gift.  If you're belt is very high (say 9 or 10), accepting gifts is *very* dangerous as the slightest food item could kill you.  Ergo, once your belt is pretty high it is *very* difficult to get back into the game.  I could see this becoming extremely annoying, effectively forcing a person to chance death & rebirth (reentry) in order to remain part of the game.

An okay game, except it really doesn't do anything for me.  The hidden goals show the direction, but it can be very difficult to make progress since this necessarily entails accepting face down cards (gifts).  In other words, acceptance of blind cards leads to potential progression or potential pain..?  Not a good recipe.  Even though I don't like it much better, I'd rather play [GAMEID=3955].

RATING: 6.2
I would categorise this game as a party game.  Basically different players may choose different characters (on random) which results them in achieving different goals to win the game.

The different goals may be:
1. collect 3 different treasures.
2. eat and drink the required number of dishes and wine respectively.
3. collect 3 daggers or kill Caligula (King of the game).

All the player's characters in the game remains unknown to others except for the player taking on as Caligula.

Good points: Interesting way to kill a player by tricking the player to take enough poison or eat too much food and wine.  Players can loosen their belt by different activity cards so that they can eat more.

Bad points: When players are in the edge of bursting their belt, they usually will refrain from eating anymore and will never achieve their goal.  Caligula, who is the character known to everyone, will always be the open target to the rest and would be difficult for the player with Caligula to win the game.

Many compare this to Bang, and there are several similarities, but I like this so much better. All players are involved nearly all the time. You have to pay close attention to what others take, then like poker, you need to learn their tells, watch what they keep and give away and look for patterns. This light little filler can actually get pretty deep once you play it a few times. You can definitly overthink the priviledge cards.

Another secret identities (secret goals) game that has similarities to Bang!.  It's full of bluffing and reverse-psychology.  At first blush, it seems like players have more control compared to Bang!, but there is still plenty of randomness, luck of the draw, and collateral damage.  Especially when players use their once-per-game special action card.

RATING: 7
Wasn't expecting to like this - and was I wrong!

This is a great filler (as long as people play at a pace) and good for non-gamers as its more about playing the other players than any deep thinking. First game will be all about killing others off (here eat this deer ...) but then you realise that just helps Caligula win, and then it get a bit more of a game.

Overall, a good filler for 5, not sure I'd want to play it with 3 though.

I enjoyed this and thought it was quite fun and clever filler, and very nicely thematic - sort of in the same hidden roles/screw your neighbor genre as Bang!, but actually fun and actually a good game. But it does need to move along; you've been warned. May be better for casual gamers than the more serious.

I gave this one a few chances, but I feel like it's just too predictable. For example, if you're the only one collecting the luxury items, it's impossible to keep yourself hidden. I had to sacrifice myself so I could start over, which is lame.

Bacchus’ Banquet is een spel van Frederic Moyersoen. U kent Frederic misschien van zijn klassieker Saboteur.

Het spelidee is eenvoudig. Iedere speler trekt een kaart met een geheime rol. Elke rol heeft een ander doel. Einddoelen kunnen zijn: het verzamelen van wijn en voedsel, het verzamelen van 3 zwaarden, ervoor zorgen dat Caligula sterft, en zo verder. Als je aan de beurt bent, kies je 3 kaarten uit een aantal openliggende kaarten. De andere spelers moeten duidelijk kunnen zien welke 3 kaarten je neemt. Eén kaart moet je zelf houden, een andere kaart leg je ongezien uit het spel en de derde kaart geef je gedekt aan een andere speler. Nu moet deze speler beslissen of hij de zopas gekregen gedekte kaart aanneemt (zonder naar de kaart te kijken) of doorgeeft aan een andere speler (zonder naar de kaart te kijken). Je mag de kaart nooit aan dezelfde speler teruggeven, maar als elke speler de kaart heeft geweigerd, dan gaat de kaart terug naar de startspeler. Deze kaarten kunnen voor de spelers voordelig of nadelig zijn. Je kan wijn, voorwerpen, voedsel en vergif ontvangen. Vaak heb je eten en/of wijn nodig om het spel te kunnen winnen, maar als je te veel eet of drinkt, kan je zo dik zitten dat je buik ontploft (en je karakter sterft). Dan neem je een nieuwe geheime rol en begin je opnieuw. Wie het eerst zijn einddoel bereikt, wint dit spel.

The game-play is decent, but this is a game about acting up. You need drinking when a wine card is played, and Caligula shouting "bring forth the soapy frogs!"

This game can be a 8-9 when played by the right crowd, or a 5 when not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I don't think this is really all that much like Bang.  The core mechanism here is that you take 3 cards, keep 1, discard 1, and gift 1, and a solid little game was built around it.  Players need to be very aware of the cards they pick and pass out, as victory depends on not handing someone else the win as much as getting yourself to your goals.  I need to play this one some more to see how much better it can get with familiarity.  it is a solid design, and I suspect one of those games that is best when you play a few times in a row - the game length (20 min) supports that nicely.  There is some fiddliness in the rules about when and how you can play privilege cards that I think should have been streamlined somehow.

RATING: 6
Neat little conflicting goals filler card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good blend of tactics and bluffing. There is deduction of other players' characters. Also, when somebody gives you a secret gift, is he hoping that you will accept the poison, or that you will reject the gift so he can eat the lobster himself? 

Downside: there's not much to do if you aren't the active player, and you can't become the active player unless you accept a gift. There is a privilege card that allows you to take actions out of your turn, but otherwise you may be stuck doing nothing.

RATING: 7
An original thematic idea for once! Suffers a little from the "Kill Dr. Lucky" syndrome in that usually the player wins whose plans cannot be foiled anymore by a "privilege" card. Fun in the right group, and not as long as people make it to be - we played 2 4-player rounds directly after each other which took 45 minutes each, which I think is really ok for this type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A typical hidden roles game, with a drizzle of social-deduction here, and a splash of deceit there. The 'belt' track that players must manage in order to not burst from gluttony or collapse in a drunken stupor is admittedly a neat idea. And the 'Gift' phase can be quite humorous as players pass the proverbial hot-potato. But, when it comes down to it, Bacchus is easily trumped by Coup or Werewolf/Resistance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once.  A cute 30 minute card game with hidden roles and goals, about offering gifts to the other players.  Be sure you are aware of the rule that allows people who haven't collected as many gifts to preempt the offering process and grab something for themselves, or they won't have very much fun, as it feels like you have to have permission from the other players to play without that rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow! I'm very impressed by this game. On the surface, it looks like a light filler but it has serious depth, dynamic play and is really fun to boot. 

The "must take gift in order to have the initiative" mechanic is brilliant. You can really play mind games here. The privileges then add a neat layer without being game-breaking. And even though it's a short game, the theme really comes alive. A shame the game is not more popular.

RATING: 6
Fast fun, simple game with hidden divergent victory conditions, luck pushing and bluffing.

Duration: Fast with little downtime.
Design: Hidden victory conditions and hidden moves make this a game about bluffing, deduction and psychology.
Strategy: You can take risk-averse or risk-tolerant moves, deduce and block other players' objectives, and pass cards that may be beneficial or harmful.
Components: Cartoony drawings fit the wacky theme, is played purely with cards and player reference sheet.
Theme: Fun, though not sure how historically accurate it is.

RATING: 7
This is a light fun card passing game that could pass as a party game. Players have secret roles and try to fulfill the winning conditions for their particular character by collecting cards and using the the effects to meet requirements and/or knock out other players.

More fun than I expected. 

I'd give it a 6 or 7. Not a buy game, but I'd be happy to play if it was time for a "filler."

One of those secret role things where players have different win conditions. It didn't do much for me, and the outcome seems largely determined by luck of the draw. Ugly art too. On the plus side, there is some deduction when the face down gifts are passed around, but that's not enough to save this from complete mediocrity.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (July 2011)

Best game I have played by designer Frederic Moyersoen (I have played Nuns on the run and Saboteur and dislike both of them). It has some interesting mechanics and I love hidden role games. The characters are very unbalanced, it is easier to win as Octavious than it is as Vespasianus but I don’t care much as the game has a short play time.

I think Bacchus' Banquet continue to be the best game from Moyersoen, that’s not saying much as I almost never want to play it but I enjoy some of the facets of the game.

I will probably play it again in the future but I don’t think I will ever buy it. I’m downgrading its rating so my feelings for the game matches the BGG recommended rating system.

A clever little game that has an unusually unique theme that I find enjoyable.  The little belt buckle is the clincher, though it's more fun to think of the person exploding from overeating (a la Fette Bauche/Pop Belly or the guy in Meaning of Life) rather than simply being incapacitated.  I generally enjoy bluffing games, and this one is easy to learn and has some fun decisions to make.  It ends up feeling a little bit like games like Fist of Dragonstones by the end though, where you try to keep everyone in check, but at some point it becomes impossible to keep someone from winning.  That is, of course, assuming that your opponent are actually trying to achieve their goals and not just bluffing the entire time.  :)

Card game with hidden objectives.  It has a social deduction element based on the card play and what people say.  It was mildly entertaining, but I would rather play Coup or the Resistance.  It seemed to run long for what it is.  That could be a function of who I was playing with too.

I used to love this game, cause the first time you play it you will love to give poison or fat food to your friends to make their belly blows up.
After a few time you play it, it starts showing its weaknesses: if there are 3 conjurer at the table it's almost certain that they win, while if you have some other character it's very unlikely to win. 
Every turn the first player it's chosen by the previous first player, so you could never  play if no one chooses you. Ok, this is very unlikely, but every time happens that some players plays a lot more time than some others.
And if you are very close to the victory, nobody will give you the possibility of playing  ever again so you will have to wait until the end of the game armless (it can be 10-15 minutes wait). That happens in particular with 2 roles.
So: if you're looking for a funny game to play 4-5 times top it's perfect, but if you're looking for a solid game it sucks.

Once the group figures out your role, you can easily end up sitting out the entire game. If you're not forced to just sit there while everyone else plays, you'll instead be forced out of the game, where at least you can go do something else. Very disappointing. 

Those who say it's rethemed Bang are completely missing the above point. At least in Bang I get to keep playing, keep trying to influence the outcome of the game. Heck, my side can even win in Bang, even if I'm knocked out.

Torturous, not at all recommended, even for those who generally enjoy "take that" games.

RATING: 3
Game in a Nutshell: Play as one of several guests at a banquet with your own objectives. Pass cards around to meet your objective as well as hinder your opponents from theres.

Played as: 4,5 player

Pros: Good, well implemented theme. It really feels like you're at a banquet with a bunch of shifty people you can't trust.

Cons: I may just not like bluffing games, but this one in particular felt like a game of picking hands: in one hand is a slap in the face; the other, at best, a diversion until they can once again slap you in the face. On top of that, the different characters felt far too unbalanced in terms of goals, and the cards too easily dictate the likely winner.

Other: This is basically a game of messing with peoples minds. As a beginner it almost seemed like the game was a joke on me as my general lack of understanding was taken advantage of... not a fun first impression. Maybe with a group on an equal level of understanding there's plenty of fun to be had, but I'd prefer something more universally enjoyable.

Best Use: A fast bluffing game of screw your neighbor for a group who likes that.

Неплохая игра для небольшой компании. Для совсем новичков я бы не советовал - тут важно, чтобы все понимали что в игре происходит и один неопытный игрок может разрушить всю игру.

Суть в том, что игрокам раздают тайные роли (как в мафии или в Bang!), у каждой из ролей своя собственная цель, достигнув которую он побеждает. По поведению игроков надо выяснить, какие у них роли, чтобы не дать им возможности достичь своих целей раньше вас. Есть простор для блефа и для дедукции, надо немного думать.

Единственный минус - если все роли уже ясны, то игра превращается в занудное тягание карт с целью вытянуть то, что тебе нужно - другие игроки костьми лягут, но тебе победить не дадут, но совсем патовой ситуации в игре быть не может - рано или поздно кто-то выиграет. В итоге чаще оказывается, что поздно. За исключением этого прискорбного момента игра замечательная.

This game was just really slow and boring, not fun filler type territory at all. And you can wait for a long, long time between turns if people think they've sussed your role out and don't want to give you a shot at the next card choice.

RATING: 6.5
All in all, a decent game that does not have that early player sits around and waits aspect that many games of the type are plagued by. There is less interaction then you would think here and it is a little dry. It does play fast and is simple to understand and definitely plays best at five since more characters are out and there is more back and forth. Worth a try, but I still am not a huge fan of the genre in small groups since there is not enough interaction or options.

RATING: 7
Only played once and I'm not ready to commit to a rating.  It's kind of an odd first time play, as it seems light and goofy, but has a hard nub of tactical play and bluff in it.  One subtlety - the role of the daggers - had a sudden and dramatic impact in our first play, as one player was incapacitated, then came back as a conspirator and immediately won.  For all non-Caligulas, those are dangerous cards to put in play, but coming at the game with a light approach leaves this issue unseen.

Having played twice, it feels much smoother and more cleverly bluffy.  Simple, too.

Cute little game - could go very fast or very slow depending on how the cards come into play and how well the Caligula character plays the game. I like the hidden gifts to other players - it makes you really look at other players and there ended up being a lot of laughing in general while staring each other down.

RATING: 7.5
Awesome hidden role game. Flows good and really pits people against each other. Played with five it is a little jewel and works great where other great hidden role games may not work so well (The Resistance or Werewolf).

A minor downgrade - if people don't get it, this game turns bad quick.

Tries to be a bluff game but ends up being too random and boring. Also the play order isn't sequential so you can end up not making a move for quite a long time which turns it into a pretty terrible game.

Game of bluffing and take-that-ing. Unbalanced goals and swingy plays mean there isn't much strategy involved, but it's quick and pleasant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Similar to Bang with no elimination as another random character is given if you are killed, but working out the hidden roles is less active, less vocal but more subtle via the card play of selecting the 3 facedown cards to i)discard, ii)keep and iii)give. 

Privilege cards disrupt this play, which from experience adds a confusing layer for first play, so may be best to not use them until the mechanics and terminology have been established. Doing so seems to make for a quick first game which may generate interest in another game with the privilege cards as there is fun to be had when plans backfire. 
 
Unfortunately, I think the repetitious card selection can muddle the memory with previous turns (much like hidden role selection in Citadels - unless it is a sign of ageing!!), which undermines the players' ability to actively tabletalk, necessary to make this type of game enjoyable. 

Hence I feel this may be the reason why so far the game receives a lukewarm reception. Another drawback which may put players off is the waiting game of the required card to come up, especially when faced with a seemingly too large a drawpile. Also as Caligula there is no sense of delicious paranoia that I felt as the sheriff in Bang (as there are no hidden supporters).

Simple card game with hidden objectives. In a similar vein to Bang, Lifeboat and Shadow Hunters, Bacchus' Banquet provides some opportunities for bluffing and a little "take that" action. I'm not sold on the balance of the different objectives; some seem decidedly easier to achieve than others and, depending on how the cards come out, you may either find it very easy or very difficult to gather up any of the elements you need to collect.

I really like this game, not so sure why! It's got secret roles, a public role, a conspiracy where some players might be collaborating, logic, deduction, and ... oh did I forget, a great banquet! There's food, wine, and oops a dagger to kill Caesar.  Doesn't take that long, and your success is heavily influenced by the other players, but it's a funny take on the hidden role genre. Don't eat too much at the banquet or your belt buckle will bust!

Like Bang!, but not necessarily better. The artwork has its charm, but I'm not a fan of it. A lot of the game seems to come down to "did you pick A or B?", and I find that sort of deduction kinda inelegant. Some other aspects of the game design also feel "messy".

Early reviews probably led to overly high expectations for this one. There were plaudits who declared this as a ‘Bang’ replacement. Being a keen fan of Bang, my interest was piqued. The theme? Players have secret roles at Caligula’s banquet. They have VP conditions they try to fulfill. Caligula’s requirements are simpler but known to everyone else.

Cards are ‘drafted’. The active player takes one, discards one and gifts one to another player. If the player accepts (the card might be bad as it could wreck a player’s VP plans) they get to ‘draft’ cards next turn. This is a clever mechanic but flawed. How so? The designer provides an ‘out’ for players who get locked out. If a player has two cards less than every other player, they can to jump in and choose to be gifted with a card.

The package has nice elements (secret roles) but plays out rather patchily and inelegantly. The current ‘deus ex machina’ of choice in card games, game breaking special cards, feature fairly heavily. Thankfully, the game is quick enough to prevent players from getting too frustrated. Another knock this game takes against Bang is the 5 player limit. There are too many characters that sometimes there isn’t the same synergy and tension and knowing winks as Bang (where players are trying to work together while trying to work out secret roles). If you want something with a similar gaming experience, pick up the cheaper and more portable Bang and/or Saboteur.

WARNING: I'M BIASED AS I WORKED ON THE ART FOR THIS PROJECT.

This is a quality little filler game.  Big on theme and interaction, with especially entertaining results.  It works strikingly well for such a non-linear game; turns are taken completely out of order and are activated by other players.  There is a heavy level of whimsy and personality in the system, that while it doesn't expect you to take it too seriously, there is a worthwhile game underneath.

People are calling this "Food Bang". I agree that there are similarities to Bang, but I also think it strips away all the worst parts of Bang (Length, take that quality, lucky card draws, player elimination) and adds new, twists in bluffing and gameplay. 

Despite the fact that the game allows for you to jump in if you get left out, it can be frustrating if people aren't offering you what you need.

There isn't a whole lot of strategy here and the bluffing element is too simple and easy to figure out.  It's still somewhat entertaining if played once in a great while.  There are countless other games involving bluffing that are far superior though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game fills the same niche as Bang! but with the theme of a Hedonistic party at Caligula's house.

Each player has a separate hidden identity (except Caligula, much like the Sheriff in Bang!) and is trying to achieve the goal that matches their identity.  The goals include eating, drinking, accumulating gifts, or killing Caligula.  This is achieved by strategically picking and passing around cards showing the different game items.

The art and themes of this game are both humorous and disturbing.  Something about having a sliding scale that represents your belt but also a mechanic in the game where you can eat yourself to death gives me really mixed feelings.

In the end though this is just a bad game.  Who gets to actually play is decided by who the previous player gave the gift for that round.  So the entire game can go by without a player ever getting to actually play.  And managing these cards are the only way to attempt to accomplish your goal.  Either that or just luck into it which isn't much more fun.

Trying really hard to capture the flavor of Bang, but fails in my book. The game uses a similar "hidden" character method as in Bang, but unlike Bang where you get to interact with other players directly, passing gifts around the table just does not capture the conflict or tension between players. Besides, one can dodge the bullet by not accepting the gifts. 

Caligula gets targeted real easily and there is really no way to prevent the dagger from coming out to maim Caligula.

A miss in my book

Fun little game, pretty group dependent, but can be a nice light-hearted filler.  There isn't really much of a game to it, just some slight mind-games and deceit above the table.

It's unfortunate that it takes a game or two to understand how to win and play your special cards, but the game isn't really exciting enough to warrant multiple plays. 

It  helps if everyone is familiar with "The Princess Bride" ;-)

Interesting party game with werewolf elements. Could be houseruled mayby better if you could actually see the gift before using priviledge OR you would get new priviledge after your character has died. But there might be balance issues there!

Gioco simpatico per il tema, un banchetto al tempo dei romani, ma le meccaniche sembrano non girare a dovere a mio avviso infatti il dovere accetare la carte per poter diventare giocatore attivo ti costringe a lunghi periodi di inattività. Per il resto il gioco funziona ed i ruoli da interpretare sono abbastanza bilanciati.

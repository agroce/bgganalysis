A decent tile-laying game that can be played solo.  I mostly play it solo, for which it is okay to kill a few minutes, though it can get old quite quickly.  It's not bad as a two player game, but nothing special.  A filler game at best.

Seria un buen regalo para nongamers:
A solid ‘non-gaming spouse’ game, since it has many features that are desirable in such a game: it’s light, it’s fast, it’s pretty and it’s lucky enough to make losing easy to take. Plus, it’s pretty non-confrontational

After just one play (one game only), it's hard to say if it's too light, or just light enough to play multiple tounds, which I want to try next time.  And the fact that I *want* to try it again says something.

RATING: 7
This is a light 2 player version of Entdecker.  Game play is very easy and very light and the game could be played extremely fast if the players want it.  For fans of exploration games, this one might tickle that fancy in under 10 minutes per game.  Of course 10 minutes doesn't give you much time for depth, so plan accordingly.  Would be interesting to have a version that was slightly larger and played 3 players.  Maybe that would just end up being Entdecker though.  Keep it light to find the fun in this one.

I have really enjoyed this solo. My wife purchased for me for Christmas so that I would have something for the road instead of Triplica (I travel a lot for work, and when not working, the hotel can be boring as I am not really a drinker!).

I have played a couple of solo rounds and I like the tile laying that begs for Carc comparisons. Very fun, and well suited for its purpose.

This is a very fun game when you don't have a lot of time, and it doesn't impinge on the marital bliss the way some other two player games do. The online tutorial with Prof. Easy is helpful if you are confused about how to lay tiles. I definitely want to purchase Entdecker.

As a solo game, this is probably the best I've ever played. I used to love the different maps I would end up with at the end of the game, simply beautiful. However, these days if I'm going to play a game alone, I just play an app against an AI.

As a two-player game, it feels like a very simplistic, quicker, Carcassonne. And I'd rather just play Carcassonne.

I needed a light tile-based game I could share with a friend of mine. I've tried to get her to play Carcassonne without luck. This game is perfect for her, although she IS prone to analysis-paralysis due to abuse she has taken in the past. 

A fair light game for when you have a headache/jetlag/marathon-sessions-of-ASL. Not for everyone.

So what if it doesn't bring anything new to the table, neither do 90% of the games coming out of Germany these days.  So what if it's mostly luck- it's easy and has an addicting quality, just like Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, and Ticket to Ride.  Although it's not necessarily in that strata,  this is a simple, light, and very fun game that is perfect for a between-games diversion for 2 or even 1 player.  It's nice to see the Entdecker system stripped down to its core...I think this is probably a better game in the long run.  It's hard to find a better board game for $15 retail.

RATING: 5
Inexpensive, quick 2 player game with the bonus of solitaire rules. Great to have this around when I want a light game with a bit of strategy and nobody else in the house wants to play games. Took me longer than I care to admit to figure out the rules regarding the top border of the board -- the forums were a big help in that regard.

Similar to Entdecker.  I solo play this game. Guess which way to explore to find islands for points. Meh...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Production: Wonderful tiles that form an attractive map by game's end.  The scout tiles are functional, though they do obscure the map a bit.  Play: Much, much, much faster than Entdecker, and much simpler.  It retains the best part, the sea exploration.  I enjoy seeing the islands develop, and hoping for the right tile to guide the island's development as I wish, but there isn't much control over this, except when I have a face-up tile in front of me to use.  The game is so quick that it's difficult to really settle into playing it.   (2+0+2) (2 plays)

I'm enjoying this light solitaire game! I can't wait to try the 2-player version.

On your turn place an explorer ship on a circle field on one of the three sides of the game board and draw a sea tile. Place the tile if it fits, i.e. when water borders water and land borders land. Throughout game-play a fascinating seascape unfolds before your eyes. The size and arrangement of the islands on the board is different in each game!

RATING: 4
Entdecker boiled down to the bare bones, for two players or solo puzzle play.  The two player game is very luck dependant as the chances of drawing an unplayable tile are much greater (due to smaller playing area).  Still, at around 10 minutes per game, perhaps that doesn't matter so much.  The puzzle game, where players score the square of their island size, seems to be the way to go with this one.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's Entdecker-Lite, and I mean light... but I like it. It plays fast (a full game usually only takes 10 or 15 minutes.) The solitaire game is also fun and a good way to practice for future 2-player matches.

RATING: 1
Rules as written are broken and the game is borderline uplayable. I have no clue how everyone else actually plays this thing... obviously they are "reading between the lines" or otherwise making assumptions. If you carefully read the (English) rules and play as written, your games will almost *never* end in such a way as the end game conditions take place. Instead, the game just suddenly ends (rather early) because there are no legal spaces left to explore from. My guess is that there is a good game here, but the Enlgish translation missed something vital.

RATING: 5
Part of the Great Solo Initiative of 2017. Unfortunately this game doesn't bring too much to the table. It's a tile laying game without many decisions. You pick a square on the grid where you want to go, draw a random tile and position it accordingly. (In the instructions under Tips and Strategies it actually says "try to draw a tile that ..."  You're drawing a tile at random! How do "try to draw a tile that..."?)

It also prides itself on being compact and easy to pack. But it'seems a little TOO compact; I feel like I need a tweezers to play the tiles and especially the scout tokens. Scout tokens aren't used in the solo game so that's a plus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Picked this up for $3 at a thrift store, brand new.  I was already a fan of Entdecker so I wanted to try this game as a solo option.  While more of a puzzle it does work and something I'd be interested in trying as a two player experience.

I like tile laying, like the designer, and don't mind the occasional lighter game, but even under $10 I couldn't get myself to buy this one given other game-owning options because it was too light / luck driven (though I acknowledge some thought with regard to tile and marker placement is required).

First played July 12th, 2007.  It's a quick learn (<5min) if taught and quick play (<20 min).  If you are the first to read the rules, however it will probably make your head spin.  There were things that didn't seem to add up for me with the dotted lines.  Also the fill in the tile part confused me as well.  It's probably one of my stronger "6" games too as I enjoyed it.  It's a great filler type and good two player game to have in your stash of games.  I'd recommend giving this a game play and consideration in playing every once in a while.  It seems to have a good balance of luck/stragegy for me as well.

Mar09:  I think my wife summed it up best: "Why aren't we playing Carcassonne?"

On it's own, Oceania isn't that bad.  It's got the pretentious Truber rules.  And the play is a little rough.  It's still a quadruple improvement over Entdecker though.  In fact, it pretty much has all the interesting bits of Entdecker without the fluff.  The problem?  The interesting bits aren't that interesting.  The decisions are weak and the fun isn't present.

Solidly bleh.

Good mix of tactical play and light luck that creates an enjoyable light two player game that plays well with the wife.  Some have compared it to Carcassonne, but we have found it to be superior to that snoozefest.

It's a bargain at around 11$, but I would have paid more for thicker tiles and nicer scout pieces.  (There is certainly room in the existing box for both.)

I've yet to try it solo, but it looks like a passable game that way as well.

Haven't settled on a rating yet, but the solo play is nice, light, and I keep going back to it. I've decided that this is a boardgamer's version of a card player's basic solitaire. I must note that I hate basic solitaire, but I am really enjoying this game as a solitaire version. I'll leave it up on my home desk and play it as the progress bars march to 100%. A pleasant find. Good for rainy days, and light solitaire filler.

A decent little game that just doesn't hold very much fun for me personally.  For those that are enamored with tile-laying games, I can see how they would enjoy it.

played once, got negative 216 points.  I like that, as it suggests it's not pure luck, but that with experience the result will be a higher score.


however, i'm guessing it will be like learning a system, and once the strategy is learned, the replay value will go down.


will have to check back in after some more plays.

Only played the single player game. At first things looked pretty bleak as I had to randomly discard lots of tiles. In the end I hoped to close off the edges and in doing so create a huge central island. This randomly worked and I got 441 points. I see no reason to ever play this way again, but I guess the two-player game would rate one point higher at the least.

Not as rich a 2-player as many of the early Kosmos-for-2 games were, but still a nice compact (I'm pre-disposed to liking small games).

Quick Carcassonne. Meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game idea is interesting and it's a quick game. But you suffer a lot from the luck of the draw and there is little strategic move you can do.

I also find it totally stupid that you need to sacrifice a scout in order to place a tile you could not place because you were not lucky in the draw.

I made a small variant that allowed scouts to do land exploration and it now seems to work better. With this variant, I would rate it 6, else it does not worth being played.

The only other drawback I found is that there is not many combination of tiles for connecting the same lands compared to Carcassone where you have much more possibilities to connect or block. So sometimes, it becomes almost obvious which tile is going to get played where.

This is an interesting game that is basically a simplified version of Entdecker. Though it is ok as a two-player game I love the fact that it works with just one. Its actually not too bad of a one-player either. If you ever played a video game just to see how many more points you could get the next time around then this game is for you. It also works pretty well as a filler two-player game.

Low rating as it really is a very light game.  "Entdecker lite" is really not accurate.  It is "Entdecker SUPER lite".  That being said, it is an OK game for a very quick filler.  The solitaire game makes for a few nice games, but after 3-4, it's stale.  One bright spot is the ability to use this to entice a newer gamer into Entdecker!

The solitaire variant is a risk management puzzle. I found it a bit underwhelming, but puzzle fans and easygoing Entdecker/Carcassonne players might enjoy it. Then again, they could play a solo scoring variant of Carcassonne. The results are pretty.

Good for what it tries to be. Actually, EXCELLENT for what it tries to be: an ultralight version of Entdecker (which I love). Each version of Entdecker has its own unique rules for scouts, and Oceania is no different. Its single/double/triple scout tokens and the sacrifice rule for playing face-up tiles are just right.

Purports to be a 2P/solo version of Entdecker, but ended up being a frustrating (albeit quick) luck-fest. By halfway through the game, it seemed each starting spot only had one tile which would work, and with a 1/5 chance of pulling that one, you really don't feel like you have much control over your destiny. Carcassonne has tile-drawing chance, but some of the fun is if you draw a bad tile, at least getting to figure out a Plan B for where to put it. Oceania has no Plan B.

Light tile placement game that feels a bit like Carcassonne where players are trying to complete islands but have more scouts on them than their opponent to score a completed island. 

Solo game is very puzzle like and is all about creating as many completed islands or large islands as possible and minimise the unexplored space.

Overall a largely forgettable game but it does offer some of the lighter elements of Entdecker...so that game may be worth a look if there is more going on.

Fairly easy to learn, although the English rules as printed could have been clearer. The solitaire game plays quickly, and although I can't say it's fun, does at least present some challenge, mixed with luck of the draw regarding which tile happens to come up at what time. Obviously, the two-player version is more competitive, as players must, in effect, outbid each other with meeple value to score completed islands. In its own right, a decent design, but there are certainly many more better, more fun, and more challenging games out there. I don't own, nor have I played Entdekker, so I can't comment on that as others have. As a solitaire game it's a nice filler for those times when I don't feel like dealing with a more complex game yet want to get something out of a gaming experience. Overall my feeling is simply that there are many better games of this sort. Purchased used, August 2012.

This is a game I held off on purchasing for a long while...because...well...I just wasn't sure! I do like the game and it does have a most enjoyable solitaire variant! The game is nice, short, and simple to play! A nice quick game in a different style! At first I thought there was very little strategy involved and there was too much luck in picking the right tile; now I feel the strategy is in careful placement of tiles and understanding the layout of the game board. Trying to create surrounded areas is the challenge and key to a good score!

Nice quick filler for 2 players - kind of a Carcassonne light, if you can imagine.  Beautifully produced and pretty to look at, I think this might be a good game to play with my wife.  It's a nice theme (exploring tropical islands) and it's dead simple to play.  Not much depth, and certainly a lot of luck, but overall a tidy little game that does what it does quite well.

A 2 player streamlined version of Entdecker, with each turn being an effort to explore empty spaces on the grid (ie turn over a sea/land tile and see if it fits the space you chose to explore) and then decide whether the island you've created or have added to is worth competing for, and if so land a guy on it, aim being to control the biggest islands. While turns can be interesting (choosing where to start, odds of success, assessing likely island growth and chance of landing people and winning it), there's too much luck in the tile pulling (and therefore the resultant competition of landing guys) for there to be much tension or desire to replay.

Picked up as a g/f intro to gaming game. Not played yet. Intrigued by solitaire potential. She ain't gonna play it. Punched but unplayed and up for trade.

RATING: 6.5
Have only played solitaire (playing both players). Have not yet tried the actual "solitaire" variant. Oceania is a light exploration game. Luck of the draw heavily affects the outcome, but there is some strategy in ship and tile placements. Super fast filler game (10-minutes).

RATING: 5
Not sure if this warrants a spot in the same collection as Carcassonne - it is awfully close in gameplay.  I guess it does play solitaire, but I doubt I will.

A quick & simple version of Entdecker, but also very light. After a couple of rounds, my impression is that the strategy level is very low.

Hmm, tentative rating after 2 plays. It's like Carc super lite. Not as many options. It plays fast and ends just as it starts to crank up!

Entdecker lite. As Entecker doesn't have a ton of girth to it, this makes this almost etherial.  It's nice enough, and I'm sure that you could get better at it, but man there is a lot of luck in tile draws.

Very simple and nicely-presented tile-laying game, with an exploration theme.  Quick to play and an enjoyable diversion.  Little brother to (and 'travel version' of) the original Entdecker (which is awesome).

Interesting little luck based tile laying game. Plays in 15 mins & presents one or two tricky decisions in managing the tiles & VP markers. The  fast play time is the main differentiator from other tile games & this means it comes off the shelf regularly.

1 play. I miss all the stuff that was removed from basic (New) Entdecker! Frustrating that we ended up with a HUGE area we couldn't easily explore (since only 3 sides are available).

A friend of mine played this with his brother after his brother was in a very bad car accident, suffering brain damage and extensive memory loss.  He said it really helped them re-connect.

It's now been four years (end of 2009), and my friend's brother is mostly fully recovered.  I like to think this game helped with that, if only a little bit.

I've never played it, but it has earned a 10 in my books.

There is a lot to like about this game.  It's got a solitaire option.  It plays as an intro tile game for kids.  It plays quick -- most of the time, I don't have time for a 2 hour brain-burner and this game gives enough strategy and challenge relative to its 15 minute playing time to make it interesting.  The game is well-made and looks great as the map unfolds.  And it's priced right at $10.  It would be great to see this game set a trend of other "Junior" editions of games that play quick, with enough challenge for two and with a solitaire variant.  Not quite small enough to be portable.  Language-independent.  Rated 9 after many solitaire and 2-player games.

RATING: 6.5
Puzzle-like game for two.  A game about playing the odds and remaining flexible.  If you wanted to, you could probably play this in a tedious and calculating way.  But where would be the fun?  A nice diversion occasionally, but I like games with a little more going on.  Still, this game was inexpensive, and I am glad it is part of my collection.  By the way, I enjoy the two-player version more than the solitaire version.

Picked up for some light solitaire play; not awful as a 2-player either but I think it leaves a taste for something more intensive for the theme and mechanic.

RATING: 5
I'm not sure (based on just one play) that there is much of anything going on here.

There's a small element of area control/bidding going on with your... explorers(?) but the outcome seemed to be so heavily dependent on the luck of the tile draw that it seemed to become more of an activity than a game.

It's not exceptionally pretty and mostly reminded me of Maori, but that was a lot more fun than this was...

RATING: 4
There probably is some room for strategy to win out here, but this just isn't enough fun for me to explore that deeply. Regardless of possible strategic depth, there's a huge luck factor, and player options/choices are EXTREMELY limited by the placement rules. I often enjoy games that make some concessions to depth, or luck, or whatever in return for short game lenght. In this case, though, keeping the game short and simple has stripped away any fun or challenge.

I do not know what to say about this one. I do not really like it, but I would like to. So I keep playing it with the spouse. 

Edit: I have been playing the solo variant now and then, and it is not bad. It is a short five or ten minutes puzzle. Almost more interesting than the two-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are few games explicitly marketed as "For 1 or 2 Players" so I feel compelled to support this one.  Oceania takes about as long to setup and explain as it does to play, which isn't a favorable ratio for me.  Still, it's an okay little puzzler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Relatively simple puzzle game. Plays fast with some strategy around placement behind random tile draws. The exploration aspect is well done but the game has no appeal for me. I'd rather play either a deeper civ game or a simpler/quicker filler game.

Stripped down Entdecker.  Succeeds in retaining the interesting core despite the sacrifice of some mechanics.  To my mind, the lost mechanics are worth it to shift the game down to 10 minutes playing time and $15 cost.

Very nice one.
It feels like Carcassonne but shorter.
Luck factor is a little less present here than in Carcassonne because you can keep the tiles you pick wihtout playing them. But take care, at the end of the game, each unplayed tile is minus 2 points !

RATING: 5
Simple tile laying game. Comes off as a quick-paced Carcasonne. However, bits are not to the same quality (cardboard punchouts rather than meeples) and interesting use of a risk element in the tile placement. Rather than pulling a tile and placing it anywhere as in Carcasonne, a player must place the Ship at a certain entry point and then pull their tile at random. If the tile is not playable from that entry point than it counts against your total points in the end. I'm torn on whether this adds or subtracts from this game.

Klaus Teuber (Catan); 1 or 2 players; On your turn place an explorer ship on a circle field on one of the three sides of the game board and draw a sea tile. Place the tile if it fits, i.e. when water borders water and land borders land. Throughout game-play a fascinating seascape unfolds before your eyes. The size and arrangement of the islands on the board is different in each game! Category: Exploration, Nautical;  Mechanics: Tile Placement;  Other Names: Ozeanien

RATING: 5
Luck-heavy, but it still rewards planning.  It has a nice challenge, given the price and the shallow level of depth, but it does seem to play better with 2 than solo.  Still, if you're the only one available to game, it's not a bad diversion.  I dropped the rating a point when I realized that the discard pile counting against you penalized you for things out of your control.

A nice game, but somehow lacking in that "got you!" that I like. The tiles were a bit small (as was the board), and the wooden boat was a huge ugly hat-looking thing.  Poor choice, guys!  I ended up using a boat from my old "Lost Treasure" game and it looks and fits so much better! My wife enjoyed the game enough to play it 3 times in a row, so I am not going to complain too much, being as I like her playing games!

I am interested in the solitaire version of this. I played with another player and found it "good". Like most bidding games, I tend to be conservative in the hopes of keeping my opportunities until the ideal moment- which never comes. So I am not particularly good at this but I do like it, especially how the board gets built into such interesting and wonderful patterns as you go. Nice idea, good game, just not really right for me.

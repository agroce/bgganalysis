Good game in a really small box!  [b]San Juan[/b]-inspired mechanics are executed well here.  The graphic design is hit-and-miss, but it plays smoothly.  I love the concept of getting a benefit for adding a good to your player's train, thereby allowing them to ship sooner.

Such a clever, multi use cards game. Love how you can load your trains, or trains of opponents to get a bonus. You help them by helping yourself, so you have to way the importance of the bonus against them being able to fulfill an order.

Very good micro economic game. Easy to teach. Easy to set up and put away. Everyone seems to enjoy it. Not too thinky. Not too light.

The main thing keeping it from a higher score is that, fundamentally, it's still a small game with the limit that simplicity brings with it. I don't think you could play this over-and-over, week after week without it getting tiring. What you can, at the end of the day, accomplish are limited to a pretty finite set. Very little of the game goes beyond straight numbers. But, I don't think it's reasonable to demand more of it than it has accomplished. This is a good, tight economic game in the size of a standard deck of cards that you can play in under and hour. That's sufficient.

The only true negative is that it can be a bit annoying to have to keep reshuffling. This may be less of an issue with 2 players, but the ideal player count is 3 and it can go through just a little bit faster than one would want. I might suggest buying a second copy and tossing the map and starting engines from the second set, just to make the deck thicker. Unfortunately, the box is just barely too small to fit two decks side-by-side.

There's a fair bit of game inside this little box.  Isle of Trains is much more a Euro resource engine game than a conventional train game.  Yes, we are fulfilling contracts in different parts of the isle by delivering goods, but that's all handled in a very abstract manner.  For instance, the "map" we see at the start of the game is merely a collection of contracts; their locations and the tracks on them have no game role.  Visualize the wagons that carry goods as buildings that produce them and we could be back in Medieval Germany again.  The one rather neat twist that Isle of Trains delivers is the way it incentivizes your opponents to load goods in your wagons.  That creates some nice dilemmas around getting more cards and actions at the expense of helping an opponent who is doing well.

Beyond the game's resource engine nature, I have a couple of other reservations.  The first is with the luck of the card draw and how it can determine the direction you take.  The second is that Isle of Trains runs a little long for what it offers.

The artwork is really quite nice and production is to a decent standard.

That said though we missed a few important rules, including that you can't purchase a new cpntract until you complete the seconedary contract.

I enjoyed this game much more on the second play through using the correct rules. While its still not a great game I enjoyed it considerably more this time around. I would play this again and will probably take it out from time to time.

Nice fun engine (zing!) builder game with minimal cards. Cards are a little busy, and you have to rotate them defending how you want to use them. That is both a good and bad thing because it uses less cards, but makes it a little confusing at first.

RATING: 8
Clever resource conversion card game, with plenty of luck of the draw, but also quite a bit of punch regarding players' decisions. Do you want to accelerate your opponent by loading his train to get the free bonus? A solid design and one I would love to see expanded. Recommended.

+ Solid mechanisms, well woven together
+ Very interesting semi-cooperative / exchange rate valuation mechanism
+ The game feels tight and balanced
+ Interesting decisions for most of the time
+ Some tactical nuances that will take a few games to pick up
+ Plays well 2-4
+ Pleasant theme, and economical design

= Has a fair amount of luck of the draw

- The graphic layout of the cards is cute but makes the cards more difficult to parse than necessary
- The end game bonus cards are randomly drawn, which can unnecessarily swing the game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.25
Lost of mechanics stolen from Glory to Rome, it makes a game with more potential than what actually accomplishes. It feels like it lacks some feedback mechanism to put all pieces in place. One of the main problems is that it is very like a "tableaux-building" game, but you don't actually get more powerful when building things. The pace of the game is more or less the same at the beginning and at the end of the game. And this feels frustrating because the game plays very slow.
It is very repetitive, too.

This reminds me of San Juan with the added element of contracts/deliveries. It doesn't have role selection, but does have bonus actions for loading cargo on another player's train.  Some fun.

Players are trying to score victory points by building a train consisting of engine and cars.  Basically a San Juan clone that removes the five possible actions, and inserts a public contract fulfilment system instead.  Churn cards through your hand, that can be used for multiple things, and hope to come out ahead.  It worked nicely, but it's no San Juan.

Isle of Trains is a small train themed pickup-and-deliver multi-use card game. I love small card games, card drafting games, multi-use card games, trains and train themed games so this seemed like it would be the perfect fit for me. It's a race game where you play as train operators, building trains with the right mix of freight cars needed to complete delivery contracts before your opponents. Places need combinations of lumber, stone and oil. There are some tough choices to be made during the game - what train cars will I build? what should I give up to build them? - as your cards are used for simply EVERYthing...the train cars you build, payment for building them, the cargo that they carry etc. When loading cargo on an opponent’s train, you receive an immediate benefit or action, but you are also giving your opponent the cargo they just might need to be able to complete a delivery contract and score big! You can also build cabooses on your train which give you permanent benefits.

I liked the idea of the game, and the multi-use cards (which I feel is a terribly under-used mechanism!), but while it worked for the most part it just wasn't very good with only 2 players. Every game we got into a situation where at least once we'd be locked out of taking any meaningful actions for a few turns. Either all of our cars were full so the other player couldn't use them, or we could see that if we loaded something they would be able to fulfill a contract so we definitely didn't want to do that, or we couldn't draw/afford what we needed to build up our trains so we had to use the same tired actions over and over. It was very repetitive so it felt old and samey pretty quickly, and there was way too much of the constant reshuffling of the deck as it ran out of cards multiple times a game.

Nifty little game, perfect for playing on small table outside while barbequing. Not too crazy about the artwork but that doesn't really matter. Box is in a very silly format, too small to fit sleeved cards but bigger then the actual size of the deck of cards.

edit. Game gets more fun the more you play it. Wish you could spend more time building your actual train rather then deliver. Hope there will be an expansion with passengers!

I like the general mechanism of choosing between loading your own carts and loading others' for a sizable reward. The rest of the game feels very messy. The artwork is pretty but not too well suited for a card game (hard to spot essential information at once), the rulebook has several gaping holes (engine upgrades anyone? How is the caboose reducing train cost used during upgrades? Etc.). But most of all, I didn't have fun. There is plenty of decision-making involved but if felt very dry to me.

Have only played a few times, but this is a great game!
Because of the constant contracts, I am afraid it might become repetitive after a lot of games, but so far each time the game changes depending on the cards you are getting. all the games so far were very close all the way to the end, and the bonuses you when you load into another train is a very smart idea.

For such a small game (both footprint and price), I would highly suggest you get a copy and play, even if it will be for a few dozen games. (and I hope I will keep on wanting to get it out much more).

A simplified version of the multi-use card system, probably more similar to San Juan than its more complex descendants. Plays pretty quick. I think this would be a good intro to multi-use card games to see if you are interested in exploring the genre further, or simply want to avoid the complexity and iconography of Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome. Solid game.

Rating of 8 if for the 2p game. I haven't played multiplayer yet, I think I would like that a little less than the 2p experience.

This game has the familiar multi-use cards made popular by San Juan. You build a train, load it with goods, and deliver the goods to fulfill contracts. There are also buildings which give you end game points for certain conditions. The twist here that you can load goods onto your opponent's train, if you do you get a sizable reward. This positive interaction is really great and forces you to be very careful about which train cars you build so that you can take advantage of any goods loaded by your opponent.

It's a short game with beautiful art and some nice decisions along the way. It is lighter fare than some other excellent 2p games you could play in the same time, notably Race for the Galaxy. For those times you want a more relaxed game this is great.

Great game for learners!  It is fast and simple enough, introducing some multi-use aspects of cards, such as paying for cards with other cards. It is complex enough that it isn't boring, and fosters interaction, because the only way you can win is by helping other people load up their trains and gaining the benefits.

Of course, if you're helping the *leader* too much, it is not going to bode well for anyone else...

So much fun in a little box!

Our family has a penchant for any kind of train theme game, so we gave this little card game a chance.  This truly is a great game with innovative mechanisms where cards have different game functions.  

The game is partly cooperative in that players have short term incentives to drop goods on other player's trains, but the tradeoff is those same goods can help the train owner win. Very interesting and unpredictable strategic mechanic.  

We love this game.  I asked our 9 year old train obsessed kid if this was his favorite game in our collection, and he said, pretty much.  

We were intimidated by the instructions, so we watched the walkthrough online:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1193Mcd8ci4

Interestingly he calls a lot of the cards by the wrong titles, and at one point in the walk through forgot to discard a card for several minutes.  We were dying laughing, and it really put us in a good mood to play the game.  The complicated mechanics were simple to understand after the goofy video.

Great introductory game for multi-use cards.  I like how you can load your opponents trains and gain bonuses from doing so.  That allows you to pull off big turns, but at the risk of helping your opponents.  Nice little light filler with some actual decisions to be made on your turn.

(After one play) I *liked* this game initially, but as with many card games I wish it had a draft, rather than random draws as for what feels like a very tight game, you can 'stall' if you don't get the cards you need. It felt like it had common ground with Steam Donkey and some good, non-screwage player interaction, but I suspect that, like Fleet, I'll never be good at it.

The art is quirky and unique, but the style makes things a unclear and the cards have some small symbolism. Would have preferred something visually akin to Yardmaster.

Definitely a solid amount of actual game for sub-£10, though feels a little sabotaged by common card game randomness issues.

Lovely little game in a small package.  Multi-use cards are nice, but the REALLY fascinating stuff is helping your opponents to set up big combo turns for yourself.  Super cheap as well!
Kinda needs an expansion to make it really great, and I should add that there could definitely be AP with non-gamers, but gamers should handle it fine.

RATING: 7.25
I have to say the game is very interesting, you already know, multiple use cards is always a positive thing for me 

The game starts a bit slow and ramps up in the final stages... there's a bit of luck of the draw in the game but that's to be expected and should be taken into account in the decision making process... The hand-management is also very important so, there are some good decision to be made in this little card game.

The only "problem" with it is that it takes a bit too long to be a filler game, if it was 10 or 15 minutes less it would be a pretty cool interesting filler but the time it takes puts it over the filler slot and it's not a that good game to be fighting for table time with others that take that same amount of time to play!

This game was a surprise.  It is simple; two actions per turn.  You will build a train, load it up, make deliveries, and if you'd like to, build some buildings.  But as the cards are multi-use you can never really do everything you would like to, therefore there are interesting choices ahead of you.

Plus the art is nothing short of entirely delightful.

Isle of Trains a game with multi-use cards where you are building, upgrading and loading your train to complete contracts. This is not a game about train route building. You need to load cargo on other players trains in order to do things that will benefit you so you can complete contracts, but by loading their trains they could complete contracts before you. Interesting dilemma. Don't let the cartoon art fool you into thinking this is a kid's game.

Yet another variant on the multi-use cards genre. I can't say I care for the art, and there are some luck-dependent situations which it is difficult to see an excuse for. Some rules lack clarity. But yet, it seems to hang together pretty well. Not in the San Juan class, though.

Smart Med-Light Hand Management Card Game. Cards have 3 uses: something to build, to load, or to pay with. 

Build, upgrade, and load trains. Deliver goods for contracts. Perhaps build a building for bonus endgame scoring. Easy to teach and play. Plays in under an hour. Good feel to this one. Good 2-player. I believe I enjoy this over San Juan.

A real gem. See this one to climb the ranks.

Very very nice art. Cute, too.

Good Game Group Game. Casual Game. Family Game. Church Group Game. Beer-N-Pretzels Game. Portable Game.

One graphic negative: not readily easy to differentiate the types of cars to do upgrades correctly.

This train-themed card game features cards that can be used in multiple ways--they can either be played down as train cars, used to pay as a cost for the train cars, or placed as a load on another player's train card for an immediate benefit.  While the benefits granted for placing on an opponents car are very strong and definitely worth doing, it also gives the opponent part of what he needs to fulfill contracts, which are a major source of points.  This gives the game a great sense of interactivity--sometimes it feels like you're putting out trains with good abilities to entice the other players into picking your train.  There is a little "get there first" with the contract fulfillment, but that's my only knock on the game.  A great filler!

This is a nice portable filler with a bit of meat.  The reviews comparing it to RftG seem right, although, the only shared mechanisms are multiple use cards and Tableau  (or trains, in this case) building. This has an interesting loading mechanism in place of role selection. Definitely worth the price.

It's inexpensive. It's tiny yet incredibly dense. It has my favorite catch-up mechanic, that is, your opponent's better train cars, allow you to have better moves. The artwork is fantastic. The iconography is fantastic. The rules are one page. The game comes out often, it's great for all player counts. All in all, very deserving of a solid 10.

Like Race for the Galaxy or San Juan, but without the role selection mechanism to make it interesting.

When I played this, I constantly made procedural errors, i.e. upgrading a card without realizing I'm going over my capacity of trains on the table. I did this error twice! I think there's too much information to keep track of for such a light game (or perhaps I should play more Euros).

The map is disappointing as the location of the cities has no bearing on the game at all!

Awesome art work!

Clever engine builder that utilizes multi-use-cards. The contract fulfillment is a tired old thing, but where Isle of Trains deviates from the formula is tying bonuses to assisting your opponents in fulfilling their contracts. To build more, you must pay more, to pay more you must possess more, and to possess a substantial amount of cards is to contribute to your opponent's cargo to allow you to draw a larger hand, and carry out bonus actions to complement your, typically, 2-action turn. Finding the right balance of using your opponents' bonuses, incentivizing them to use yours, and meeting your own contracts is a fine little exercise. What's more, is that this game seems like it would play quicker at higher player counts, given that contracts run out sooner, which will trigger endgame. Neat design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is pretty restrictive, so you have to proceed carefully and manage which cards you build based on your current mission (since train length is a scarce resource).  However, you draw from a random deck, so you can spend many turns in a row just waiting to see the specific card you need.  Since the game is pretty tight and strategies are inflexible (you cannot have more than one mission at at time!), you can't just tactically switch direction.  So, you're stuck hoping you'll draw the right card.

The choice between loading your own card (for no bonus) or someone else's (for a bonus) sounds interesting.  In reality, the bonuses are so high, that you should load other people almost all of the time, and not worry about getting goods since they will load your cars.  However, this means that drawing cards that other's care able to receive is critical to keeping up tempo.  But you have no control over what you draw.  Another random element.

All in all:  The game rehashes some solid mechanic from other games.  It doesn't add anything clever or new, but it is certainly not a clone.  However, the game is not especially tight or carefully crafted, and it does not make me see those old mechanics in a new light.  So, it works fine but I see no reason to play it.

Played again 2p and it was great.. The gameplay made more sense this time around. I didnt really want to benefit any of the other players in my first game. However I realized in this last game, that you absolutely must do that if you want any chance of winning. You will benefit them with a load yeah.. But the benefits you get are huge. Example: take 5 cards and get an extra load/build/deliver action.. So you're essentially taking 3 actions in a turn. Great puzzle of a game and for $7, the gameplay you get here is insane. One of the best portable games in the market.

Played again and have decided that this is a stellar 2pgame, just stellar. Some expansions would be sweet.

I believe the sweet spot here is with 3p.

Not bad for a little travel game (although sadly the box size doesn't fit the card size and deck thickness very well). You build up your train, but there's enough options available to approach it from different directions. You can model it towards the buildings bonus points, or put together a train with big capacity storage, or build several small capacity wagons. Whatever you decide you'll need to feed off the trains of the other players in order to build the six cost buildings or lucrative capacity wagons. Timber gets you the biggest bag for your buck, then oil and finally coal. You're looking for the right opportunities to get in and make the most of a big hand of cards. It's not terribly deep or complicated.

It's not as rewarding as San Juan (2nd Edition especially), but it is a neat little card game good for taking with you for a 30 minute game with 2-3 players.

I absolutely adore this game. By far my favorite out of the DHM Rabbits Kickstarter, and defiantly the best looking. The two aspects that make this game outstanding are: 1. You have to make tough calls. There's a cost/benefit to loading your opponents train, and it's always difficult to decided if its worth more for you or them. 2. You get to build something in front of yourself (personal favorite mechanic).

[Dice Hate Me 14 Edition] {Train; engine-building, set-collection; optimal 3p} Isle of Trains seems to be the most complicated card game in the Rabbit Line series (#2-#7).  The game is interactive.  Players are forced to help each other in order to build cards.  And, players to complete for the contracts in the central display.   Surprisedly, it has multiple paths to victory in this small game.

The rulebook is confusing.  I have to refer to the BGG forums to understand certain parts.  And, please download the updated Contracts and Reference Sheet from BGG.

I loe the card illustration.  It's wonderful.  Informative and eye-catching.

RATING: 5
Neat little game. I like the mechanic where you can help your opponents (by loading cargo onto their train) in order to get a bonus for yourself. An expansion to add more cards and options would help make this into a really great game.

This seems like it will be a perfect 3-player game. With two players there's not much incentive to help your opponent because it would be zero-sum, and with four players it seems like the deck would be too small and spread out.

Really fun, rating could go up with more plays.

Update: Some of the cards have some obvious balance issues. This is especially evident in the building that gives you eight points. Other buildings cost the same but you would have to do some real work to get them to be worth at least eight points.

Also, a lot of the decisions feel fairly obvious. If you can load into a train that lets you draw 4-5 cards you'll usually just do it.

It's still a fun enough game for what it is, but not a keeper for me.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3[/b]
The two player game loses out on a big aspect because you won't deliver to you opponent's train as much. With 4 players the game could go a bit too long but I imagine it would still be okay. With 3 you get a good mix of fully using the game's mechanics plus keeping downtime to a minimum.

Sold.

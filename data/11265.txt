RATING: 7
A difficult one to rate as it has so many positives and negatives.  
Problems:
The rules!  Boy are they hard to digest.  It's not that they're inconsistent or illogical, but the style with which they are written is yawn inducing.  You just get the feeling that there is way too much fat in there - and this, alas, is borne out by play.  They need a BIG trimming.
The tactical struggle is dice heavy, but not only that - certain cards are extremely powerful and can add a huge amount of chaos to the results.
It takes ages to play. We have found that one turn can take 2-3 hours, depending on how many extra cards are drawn for resources.  That makes the full game last at least 6 hours and probably more like 8....unless there's a quick victory, of course.

Positives:
The strategic situation is fun and fluid up to a point, but it still remains tough to swing things around quickly, which is as it should be!  Although many of the cards that affect this are powerful (Canada Invaded, The Eagles Move South etc), they also give the game a lot of flavour.
The assymettrical nature of the Campaign is well done, with each side playing differently.
The game is fun to play and you do feel that strategically at least, you're learning something about history.

RATING: 7
this is a deeper multi-player CDG than it as first looks. Good knowledge of the game is required. The nature of variation in gameplay is such that it has a connection with the pre-telecom age. It seemed to me that the French could not hold Madrid, nor the rest of Spain, but repeat plays suggest the game is balanced. Today a Power which had run out of cards did nothing for several enemy card plays until an interception caused a rout, which combined with a response gave the power a resource and a card.

The Peninsular War 1808-1814 is one of my favorite war theatres.
Played twice.

It is difficult to gather a group of four players and invest some time (sessions) in this title. 
A pity that isn't feasible for Two players.
CDG very similar to Hannibal RvC (Valley), Washigtons War (GMT), No Peace w Spain (Compass).
Lots of interaction between the players (2 French comanders+English+Spanish).
The two French comanders (North Army & South Army) must collaborate between them but the score it's separate.
6+ hours session to play the campaign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fantastic gateway wargame to CDG.Extra points for a simple multiplayer wargame that could be done in less than 6 hours or a long afternoon.

The beauty comes from the four 'factions' that are not totally equal, which makes this game very replayable. The randomness of the cards are quite easily balanced by the faction cards.

Should play this game a few times to feel the simplicity but entertainingly balanced game.

RATING: N/A
Played through the tutorial and two solo games.  My first solo game took a long time, but I did significantly improve and with other players can see the game taking about 3 hours.  Good theme play.  There are a number of fiddly rules which make the game a little more complicated then it needs to be.  The combat system uses 'buckets of dice', but works very well.  Overall the game is fun and packed with action.  The components are fair.  I would prefer the cards to be more durable since this is a CDG.  The rulebook is well organized and has good examples; however, it could be better written.

I don't have a Wellington in Spain feeling with this game. Maybe the gamesystem is more suited for the Reconquista. There are too many too random events and die rolls, such as the annoying peace die roll that already existed in TNW. I wished they used historical units - divisions, brigades - instead of the use of strength points. 

And why doesn't the game start in 1809!? No, The Napoleonic Wars was a much better game.

I have played this game several times at Kingstown Gamers Meeting.  I am at a total loss and I have no idea of what I am doing.

RATING: 5
I like the card play decisions involved.  Players can set the pace for how many impulses they get each year by either playing for longevity (and preemptive advantage) or mixing it up with some short bursts of explosive power during key battles.  The cards themselves were well designed in the sense that I could see advantages for playing them either as events or for CPs.

Being a dice heavy game, I cringe when the outcome is waaaay lopsided.  I hate when the dice fail to even things out, but hopefully most sessions will not hand someone the win.  The other bothersome thing about the dice is having to constantly refer to the tables for modifying almost each and every roll for almost every action in the game.

I'm pretty sure that Wellington is more appealing as a 4-player game.  Having an ally, who is ultimately out for themselves, would probably add some much needed tension and table talk.  The next time I play it's gonna be with the full player number.

Nice and fun game. It is very luck driven by card draw and by bucket of dice rolling, so it has to be played in the right mood or by the right players. I like much the team aspect. I found a subtle balancing effect in the fewer impulses a player has if pushing hard on battle and response cards. Furthermore the randomness will give a huge replay bonus. Until now I never had two similar games. First impression in my game group has been negative, but the more I play it the more I like it.

Good four player CDG. France vs England and Spain covering the Peninsular War period prior to the big showdown at Waterloo. Similar to "The Napoleonic Wars" but with less diplomacy, minor powers, etc, and more focus on manoeuvre and battles. It works well but has a fairly high rules density so be prepared to spend some time with it - the enclosed playbook helps a lot...

Just my current rating after playing solo.
Both the scenario from the Playbook and a complete stand game.
Will probably increase when played with more players.

It was so fun to play. I cannot wait until I play this again with real players.
Maybe can be a bit chaotic, but that suits me fine.
You need to be on your toes to not loose any important cities, as the game can end very quickly.

Played again with three people and it was a blast.
But you really need to have the right view of the game as it can, and is, quite chaotic.

RATING: 5
The end of turn, automatic game-ending die roll is problematic. 
On the first turn, there is virtually no chance for the Anglo-Spanish to win,
yet there's a 1-in-6 chance the game ends.

The four player dynamic works well enough, even if it seems a little odd.

I've gotten fatigued with CDGs though - and this one, as with Nappy Wars - just
has so much chrome added to the cardplay mechanisms that it taxes even more than
most.  That, and the scope and focus on military operations, is reflected in my rating.

RATING: 4
Wow, this game is really messed up. I mean, it's sort of like a cross between, oh, I don't know, maybe some old SPI game, and Fluxx. It's got all these overwrought chromy rules which are supposed to give you some historical feel, but the whole thing is about as historical as Risk. The game is one huge crap shoot, with battles decided by each side rolling like 20 dice and seeing who gets the most hits, except that if you have Milk AND Cookies in your hand maybe you get an extra 8 dice. The monstrous card deck which is constantly being reshuffled (combined with the surprisingly generic home cards) means that the events give the game a feel of total chaos instead of historical texture. What a joke.

The embarassing thing is that the game is still reasonably fun for one play. I would even play again. You get to push counters around, it doesn't take too long (that bit is critical here), it's clearly too complex but the absolute complexity isn't that bad, and these card-driven games are fundamentally fun. But this one will clearly have a hard stop somewhere around 3-5 games. After that, give me Friedrich any day (and I'm not exactly a huge Friedrich fan!).

As an aside, I think this style of map art (it looks like a contour or satallite map or something drawn from a database) has served GMT well, but I thought it was ineffective here. I don't know if I've just now looked at so many of these things now that this was one boring map too far, or if it's just that the Wellington map is sparser and so looks very bland, combined with the fact that the background gives you absolutely no sense whatsoever for the very important terrain features, which are specified only by various somewhat-distinguishable forms of dotted lines. Regardless, I think Wellington needed a substantially better map. Given the choice, I'd take better rules first though.

[7/2/06] The game appealed to me probably a little more than I had anticipated. I will need to play both Nappy Wars and this McLaughlin design in order to ascertain which of the two I prefer. Wellington won't replace Twilight Struggle, Hannibal and PoG as my CDG favourites, but it certainly does get my vote over a number of others.

I believe the game shines with the 4-player configuration, while also being well-suited to a smaller player number.

The game features a good deal of chaos, which I personally enjoy and don't object to.

Wellington comes with rather involved rules. I wonder whether some complexity could have been skimmed off in various places. But since learning these will lessen the effort in respect to learning Nappy Wars and vice versa, I can accept a little more complexity than in other multiplayer wargames of the same length.

I am eager to play again and gain a firmer opinion regarding McLaughlin's latest design.

RATING: 8
4-player (two teams of two) asymmetric card-driven wargame. About the same complexity as Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage and can end on any one of three turns so can be over before you've really got going. Beware of burning through cards too quickly by playing them as 'pluses' (two cards in one go), responses or in battles and thus leaving yourself defenceless for the remainder of the turn. One play as the British; French (Armee du Nord) won on Turn 1 dice roll - I should have gone for Madrid rather than chasing Marshall Soult!

I think the randomness of the cards serves better at the stratigic level of "The Napoleonic Wars" vs this more tactical level.  However it is fun to play over this region and time period.  It is also nice to play as teams.

Pretty chaotic CDG; the chaos comes from the response cards that any player can play to change things around. Not a game to get if you really like to plan things carefully and hate to see unpredictability ruin your day.

I'd rate this a 7 for 2-player, but 8 for the 4-player game, as I think the internecine conflict between players on the 'same side' makes it all that much more fun...

I'm glad I acquired this (as yet unplayed). It's so cool how my Risk pieces mirror the counters, Infantry-Cav-Cannon, probably by design! The Risk piece boxes even fit perfectly in the Wellington box. Very impressive "value added" design. Looking through the playbook now...  It doesn't seem difficult. It's impressive how much effort they put into the instructive materials. Nonetheless it's a lot to absorb and I haven't succeeded yet.

First impressions are very positive.
This little game is a Napoleonic Wars on steroids. The rules are almost the same. NW players can set up the game and play in a breeze. GMT took the pain to include two pages in the playbook that explain all the differences with NW. You got variable home cards (you dwaw them from a pool), all powers starts with equal hands that remain the same through the game. 
This game is heavvy on battles and consequentely there are a lot of response and battle cards, and  there is a lot of drawing. With only 3 turns this game can be highly influenced by bad drawing luck or a ill fated battle, but if play fast and furious and it can be over in a long evening. Highly recomended.The french are strong but guerrilla and attrition will destroy them in the end.

This is a very impressive game. It plays well with 2, 3 or 4 players. There are a plethora of strategic options available to both players. I think that it is at its best with 4 players. It is nice to be able to concentrate on just one force. There is a tendency to feel 'overloaded' when it is a two-player game.I find it better than The Napoleonic Wars as it plays well with less than the maximum number of players. I feel that there is more variety in the strategy as well.

Chaos in a box masquerading as a wargame.  Not only can the dice screw you, the disparity in strength and overall effect of the cards is just too wild.  On the whole, more luck than Risk.

Stripped down Nappy Wars in Spain (no diplomacy and limited naval action).
I prefer this to TNW because it seems to play a bit faster, the card events are useful more often and the different characteristics of the players seem more distinct. Its also a very interesting situation with the smattering of Spaniards across the board. As with TNW, the angling for a win against your allies is a lot of fun.

A very interesting four-player game where all four players have a shot at winning, and each has a very distinct style of play. After my first game, all four players agreed they wanted to play it again soon, and everyone wanted to be Spain!  Not that Spain has it easy, but just that it seemed interesting to play.  The card mix is very evocative of the campaign.  My only complaint is about one (maybe two) battle card(s) that can warp gameplay in a completely inappropriate manner.

Possibly the best of the GMT Napoleon CDG line as it has the narrowest and cleanest scope, but can be played by 2-4. Worked historically fine in my multiple plays, but there's enough variability to try multiple strategies. Although British forces slowly prevail, British player doesn't necessarily win, so sloppy British play will not be rewarded.  The loss of marshals or Wellington himself is fatal.  Good game to begin with the GMT CDG line.

This game is way overchromed for what should be a relatively simple wargame. After all, at the end of the day, this game is all about getting the right cards and rolling the dice well. So why muck about with all those complicated rules? Still, the game is relatively short, and quite fun when you're in the mood just to roll dice and kill stuff and are not looking for a rich immersive historical experience or a deep strategy game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are a couple of issues that bug me with Wellington:

Maintaining a Card Advantage: Since having more cards than your opposition is so important (thereby potentially gaining extra rounds for your side in which the opposition cannot respond), there are few battle / response cards worth playing (Bloody Bagpipes, Duke of Damnation, etc) as having, or trying to keep your opponent from having, the card advantage is more important.  This can make the game rather vanilla.

Must Play Cards: Following on the above, a negative must-play that falls into your opponent's hands is doubly damning, as not only do you take the penalty, but you fall further behind in the card count as they get to draw another card.

Card Balance: Some of the cards / ops values seem WILDLY out of balance: "Hey player X drew a handful of twos and threes, while player Y drew 5s, 6s, etc."  Wellington has the broadest range of point values of any CDG I am aware of, which can wildly unbalance the game.  There are also some major event cards that can do the same.

Defensive bonuses: The bonuses on defense seem a bit high.  A single French CU behind a River is equal to Hill and 4 CUs and is 2/3 as powerful as Beresford with 6 CUs, two of the Brits' three generals...and there are a lot of rivers in Spain.

Two or Four Player Only:  The game is abysmal as a three-player game.  The unified side has a huge advantage over the two individual players.

Online Play:  Forget it unless there are only two players.  With four, the high number of response cards in Wellington (which aren't likely to be played...yet you have to wait and check) slow the game to a crawl.  

I would only ever play this again face to face with two or four players and would only do so very reluctantly.

I like the combat much better than, say, Sword of Rome, because the large quantity of dice allow the luck to even out, and the results seem proportional to the size of the engagement (i.e. you can't take huge losses unless you face a substantial formation).  Also, I like that there are big CP cards and '+' cards that occasionally allow for major, board-altering offensives rather than the strictly incremental movements of many CDG's. Tons of gut-wrenching decisions to make, good historical flavor, and enormous variety in every game.

Peninsular war, 19th century, strategic, card driven. Napoleonic Wars system. 

Admits 2, 3 or 4 players but 4 is the best option. A lot of events, some quite powerful. Reaction cards, battle cards... make the game quite dynamic and unpredictable in a certain way. 

Not quite historic, Wellington is over-powered in his combat rating I think. Anyway, the game is pure fun. Ideal for introducing newbies to card driven wargames I think.

This is a fun game but too chaotic for some:

1. It's too hard to conduct a long-term strategy when looking ahead means asking "what will I do 15 seconds from now."

2. The combat system has quirks as I found out to my regret, when Wellington and two staff officers (but no troops) fought off Joseph and three divisions! That's Wellington (5 dice), two staff officers (2 dice) and the British national bonus (1 die) against Joseph (1 die), 3 divisions (3 dice) and the French national bonus (2 dice). Or 8 dice to 6! Now I'm willing to admit that Wellington was darn good, but winning - and being the favorite - when you are outnumbered say 15,000 men to 3, is a bit much.

And, yes, I'm aware that some say a leader is a combination of combat troops and an individual. But, leaders do not act like they have assigned troops with them, as a badly led army can take a lickin' and keep on tickin' after suffering some losses, while the hypothetical "troops and an individual" leader of equal strength (but alone) simply disappears if hit once.

3. The card effects vary wildly but normally do not build on each other.

4. There seems to be 12 different ways to judge victory. (Should it really be that hard to figure out who won?)

All in all, a fun and frustrating game.

RATING: 6
Rules/cards are poorly written and can be difficult to interpret.  Game play takes double the listed time and is unnecessary convoluted.

I'm sure my rating of this game would increase with further plays but it's not worth it when there are other better wargames out there.

RATING: 4.5
Fairly standard CDG, my big complaint with this one is the very swingy nature of the game due to the chaotic card powers. Some of the cards swing the game so much it is hard to really plan much. Battle, response, cancelation, and a very large variation in card values make this title one of the less favorable CDGs I've played. One thing it does have going for it is the relatively short game length, however I would rather play Nappy wars or some of the better CDGs like VQ or HiS than bother with this.

update:  sold after several years of ownership.  I liked it, but most of the other players didn't like the high luck factor, so it was always an uphill struggle to get it on the table.
-----------------------------------------------------
good value; good rulebook, interesting playbook, decent components.  Play is very fun, with many cards coming out over just a few turns.  Peace terms and Spanish surrender rules prevent the "end-of-the-world" effect in many games - you can't sit back and wait, you always have to be making a move.

Luck is out-of-control, but what can I say, I've had a great time every time I've played it.  The fact that it is short helps.

RATING: 5
Lots of chromey rulemongering, which is unfortunate, because at its heart Wellington is a very simple and clean system. The asymmetric powers seem to work well, and although they might not be perfectly balanced, they do serve to give each power a different feel.

RATING: 7
GAME DURATION
With this game there are lots of ways in which the game can end before the end of 1814. Some sudden death game end criteria hinge purely on military achievements. One is based on the result of die roll modified by the military position. I guess the die roll is meant to represent political uncertainties around Spain's willingness to continue fighting which is influenced by how they are doing in the war. Another game end criterion is based on an unmodified random die roll result. That reflects the fact that the duration of the Peninsula War could hinge on totally independent events outside Spain. 

I have only played one game of Wellington. I played the British and Spanish and I won. However, a sudden death year end die roll could have produced a French victory. 

The sudden death rules take some of the control over game duration and outcome away from the players. I guess that reflects how it often is for military leaders.

Duration is important. The French have their best chance of winning early in game. The game is weighted in favour of Britain and Spain as the game progresses. For Britain and Spain the primary objective at the start is to prevent the French from winning and try to move towards a British and Spanish victory which should be more likely as the game progresses.  

OTHER STUFF
The game takes 2 to 4 players. The game is designed with four players in mind - Two French players, the British and the Spanish. The two pairs then play a bit like bridge partners. With the two player game I felt a bit overloaded with two sets of cards and armies to control. 

Combat involves lots of dice. 

The rules are fine once you get to grips with them but I don't think they are very well written.

SUMMING UP
I thought the game was quite well thought out. It is finely balanced. Each side has its own particular challenges. I think it conveys a flavour of the Peninsula War. 

I generally like GMT card driven war games. I think it's basically a good game with a few quirks.

RATING: N/A
Urgh. I'm not sure about this one. Not actually played it, but it strikes me, like Nappy Wars, to be one of the wackier CDGs. Card effects are powerful, and the many reactions, could make it a big take-that fest, certainly more so than Sword of Rome, which is about my limit for fun in this direction. I prefer the more restrained like in UKC, HRC, or TS.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
CDG in the style of Sword of Rome with Point-to-Point movement.

Played this one in a 4-player game. Basic CDG concepts drive the game, but a player can aquire extra cards, which seems to enable the rounds to be extended for ever. If 1 of the powers is out of cards, he has to sit and wait.

Very fluid front, so keep track of of those little duchies, cause at the end of a turn the spanish guerillas will attack every empty duchy.

I'm going to give this game a 4 only because of the large range of time that it could take to play the game.  It could take 2 hours, it could take 8, you don't know until you start playing and see how the cards work out.  If you could say this is always a long game, then I would know that and treat it with care and percision.  But it's a game played around cards and dice, you'll never know how it will all work out.

RATING: 7
Wellington is good fun and fairly well-themed, but too long for what it offers, a little too random, and provides too little feel for the historical campaign. It seems that the French can only win if they are lucky with the end of turn d6 roll(s) in 1812 or 1813, and yet it is very unsatisfying for the game result to revolve around such an element of chance. 

With altered victory conditions and some other house rules (all courtesy of my friend Valgab) the game improves markedly - I would certainly rate the modified game we now play an 8. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
In Wellington, combat may be influenced by card play, so there is an element of uncertainty. But the basic system is a dice fest. The number of dice you roll normally depends on the number of units you have, plus your commander's rating. Roll "6's" for kills and "5's" for disrupts (which turn into kills if you win the battle, otherwise each disrupt removes a die from your opponents roll). Does this less than sophisticated combat resolution remind you of any other games, like say, RISK?  

Wellington is bad, boring and unpredictable (very randomize, seemed to be highly luck driven). The diplomacy doesn't work, the rules are horrible, downtime is long, the game is unbalanced, and the game is simply boring. Despite the complexity, the game offers a ridiculous version of history. It stretches players' skills, hence the challenge and pleasure of a bad-crafted card-driven game (CDG). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While it has its good points, it seems just a little too "swingy" for so few turns.  Your card draws wouldn't be bad if you played 10x as many cards in the game but only getting a hand of cards 1-3 times per game - the 2 Ops to 8 Ops is too varied.  Also, the cards seem to favor events over Ops a little too much for my sense of balance.  The mechanics are fine but the cards themselves are my concern. The team aspect, with one winner, is probably the best part. I'll play again but probably not be the one requesting it.

RATING: 8
Highly interactive card driven wargame designed for four, playing (notionally) in two teams off two - although only one player can win.

You need to ensure your team wins (otherwise you'll lose regardless of your individual score), then have the highest score on your team.

The four factions have a contrasting mix of strengths and weaknesses, making for some asymmetric gameplay, especially on the British / Spanish side.

There's no denying that luck plays its part, but if that's not an issue (and it isn't for me) this is quite a ride.

RATING: 10
An excellent followup to The Napoleonic Wars (Nappy Wars).  At first I was hesitant to purchase this game due to it transporting the Nappy Wars system to a smaller theatre.  However, it turns out the system works very well and the situation is very different than that presented in Nappy Wars.  I have found Wellington be both an excellent two player game and an excellent four player game.  I like its shorter playing time versus that of Nappy Wars.

Fixes a lot of the problems with Napoleonic Wars, mainly all of the players start with about the same amount of cards and don't spend a lot of time without something to do.  The new looting/resources rules add some fun to the game, but allow a successful player to start steamrolling their enemies.  It can still suffer from huge swings in luck because of the event cards that allow players to draw extra cards or force players to lose cards or forces.

Napoleon in Spain. A very balanced game.  Both sides have the chance to win.  Impulse driven gameplay with 3 game turns only.  There are several sudden victory conditions.  So it is easy to finish a game in an afternoon for veteran players.  Many interesting card options and events to simulate what's happened and with a load of great historical flavour.  Wellington is active in this campaign with a drive toward Madrid.  Marshal Soult is here too.  The Spanish is weak in commanders.  The game encourages aggressive play against the other and there is a lot more room than Kutzuov to manouver on the map.  It makes the game even more interesting.  I like this game. Well worth of its price.

RATING: 3
"Card driven" in the worst sense - player decisions are essentially secondary.  The course of the game is mostly random, determined by combat dice (where a good leader without troops can send an army of tens of thousands packing, or, leading tens of thousands himself, can see that army demolished by a weaker force with a weaker leader) and the cards.  If you have lots of free time and don't have anything better to do with it, it may be a great way to while away an evening or two with meaningless play. Neither applies to me.

I'd love to try this as a 4 player game...as a 2 player game it's good fun, but the random chaos and "screwage" factor makes it seem like a better game for a fun group and a few beers than 2 grognards looking for optimum strategy.

RATING: 5
It seemed very difficult to force to reach any kind of military resolution.  All we seemed to do is wander in circles taking and re-taking each others' key duchies.  In which case the end of the game and victory seemed to be more driven by the end of turn die rolls than by player action.

On the other hand, it is entirely possible that we had totally failed to grasp the necessary strategies.

RATING: 7
Interesting game. The cards really through a wrench in the works. They can work for or against you with TREMENDOUS results. I saw the mighty French floored in three turns by a bad spread of cards and die-rolling. The Spanish position is a weak one that can be difficult to build on. I enjoyed the game overall.

Even more wide open than Nappy Wars, this is a 2P vs 2P game with the twist that only one of the two players wins at the end . The victory conditions are not as straightforward as Nappy Wars. Card play tends to be more tactical in nature and with no diplomacy gameplay is more slash and bash.

Critics who claim this game is chaotic are right, but oh so wrong. Wellington is a lot of fun to play and has a reasonable play time for a CDG. I do miss the diplomatic aspect of The Napoleonic Wars, but the upside is that all the powers will be equally involved in Wellington from start to finish.

Rating dropped a point after third play when peace roll ended the game in 1812 - what a downer! I'm not sure the Coalition can win a game ending in 1812, plus who wants to play a one-turn game? Would it change balance too much to just ditch the peace roll?

It's a great game - very challenging for both sides.  I am playing Britain & Spain and I was sure I had the French on the run.  Now the Armée du Sud is sitting in Lisboa and Wellington is nearly at Madrid.  If I lose Portugal, it's an automatic loss.  TENSION!

After one game (1812 turn only) I have sort of a neutral "been there, done that, no need to do it again" feeling. The amount of luck some have commented on didn't bother me. The down time and having to roll buckets of dice did.

UPDATE: rating just went up after another play. Very fun, and without most of the chaos and weirdness Nappy Wars has to offer (Turks in Vienna?) There are still some cavails: the "endless turn" syndrome, really arcane Victory Conditions, etc), but overall, surprisingly fun and involving with little downtime.

After all the hooplah about "oh teh chaos!" and Welly being Nappy Wars' younger, neglected, red-headed half-sister, I had a surprisingly good time with this. Can the events get wonky?  I'm sure they can, but there's still a very historical feel to the game, which I very much appreciate.  I need to get more of the moves down, but I had a blast playing it and it is truly containable. Teaching this game should be very easy, which I intend to do.  Liked it better than Nappy wars.

A very simple game to be a GMT's wargame. Rules can be easily explanated before playing and mastering them doesn't take too many played cards. 
One thing I missed was a proper summary sheet. Now it felt as if all the information was spread all over the board and rulebook (I never read the rulebook itself).

The game itself was quite thrilling. At some point it felt a bit pointless to attack, since only sixes will inflict casualties and even a roll with 10+ dice can be sixless. Well, luck is the driving force here, that's for sure. But it's ok.

In the 1813-scenario we played against the blue&green France. The setup felt a bit unfair to France, but perhaps it's ok with more skilled players.

I have nothing against a game or two, I liked the system.

How many multi-player wargames can be played in 3 or so hours? And it's a card driven game! It's fun and fast. I even think the eventual outcomes IS historic and does give the feel of the Spanish guerrilla movement and the problems the French had to hang on to Spain.

However, there are a few fiddly rules (especially compared to other CDG of similar complexity) and a LOT of wristage, both in combat, attrition and event cards. And it seems to come down to a simple equation: French keep Madrid in 1812? Roll dice twice, usually with 1 in 6 or 2 in 3 chance. Failed roll? Lose game.

Like to play it a few more times, as it could be my CDG multi-player of choice.

This game is hard!  Very tense, very brutal.  everyone is right in everyone's face and there are a lot of response cards, a lot of battle cards, so we fight a lot.  And of course the British have Wellington, but it is hard to build a concentrated French army because the Spanish can play cards to cut supply lines and force attrition checks.  In four games we've seen a lot but most of the action centres around madrid.   
  
It's a great little game.  No dip., just a slugfest with plenty of positioning considerations.

All my experience of this game is as a four player, and while it has been fun, that fun has come more from player interaction than the game. Also, I find the split of the French forces into North and South to be artificial, though that's surely a personal thing

Within the [b]Napoleonic Wars[/b] series, this title has the strongest focus on combat. The French must either win on Turn 1, or they will lose the game. There are only 3 turns before game end. The fact that Napoleon sent his most mediocre generals (e.g. Clausel) to the Peninsula Campaign is keenly felt by the low ratings for French generals. The enormous number of event cards make for a very chaotic and unpredictable game.

I'd give it a rather good rating for being playable up to four players and being somewhat quick.  Some of the math felt a bit tedious or odd on my first attempt.

It's not quite as good as The Napoleonic Wars when played two-player, but better than TNW multiplayer.  Definitely a good game - very enjoyable.  The luck can be extreme, but so far we've ended with three ties (which the French win in a two-player game).

RATING: 8
Card driven wargame covering the Peninsular War.  Components are of decent quality.  Rulebook looked daunting but things fell into place pretty quickly.  More fun as a 4 player game but still quite reasonable for 2.  Good quality and very entertaining game.

I enjoyed Wellington but want to play more to get a proper fill for the strategy. Seemed fairly balanced, the French need to really damage the Spanish and Brits early before the French start losing the reinforcement battle.

RATING: 8
Good theme play.  Need a a couple of plays to learn the rules but then easy to play.  The combat system uses 'buckets of dice', but works very well.  Overall the game is fun and packed with action.  The components are fair.  The map is unmounted paper and the cards are marginally durable.  The rulebook is well organized and has good examples; however, it could have been better written.  Game length is not overly long for a wargame, but the first couple plays may be a bit longer.

Wellington we rather liked, though I doubt it was very historical at either the strategic or tactical levels (the latter just felt wrong). It helped as two of the three players (not me) had grappled Napoleonic Wars to the ground. There would be a lot to question, including the armies sprinkled around the map, the more powerful cards (why can these not be resisted??? Or removed in testing?) and the attrition is a little odd (though nothing like as odd as SoR). There were some exciting moments, including my beating of Wellington at Salamanca - I laid a trap, drew him in, and marched the Young Guard in to smash him*. Sieges seem reasonable. I think if this game were brought down a level (there is plenty of fat still to be trimmed here) and given a firm historical basis, it could be getting there. I was disappointed it was 1812-1813 only. Otherwise, positive experience and I will go and check the books (a sure sign of enjoyment).

Napoleonic games are not my cup of tea, but I've enjoyed playing this one with three of my best pals. I think I like this one better than Kutuzov. And I sure prefer Wellington to The Napoleonic Wars.

Not a good game.  Small PtP map leaves little creativity for maneuver.  Card play is obvious, bereft of meaningful hand management.  Finally, when all is said and done, the dice dramatically trump decision making.

Wild and woolly, with plenty of outrageous fortune and tension. Simplifies the Nappy Wars system, but the decisions are just as agonising. There's far more player interaction, with more battle and response cards, making this one of the best CDGs in my view.

One of the worst CDGs in this list, perhaps plainly the worst of them. Four turns of foolish combats with very little chrome and historicity cut down to almost nill due to the time scale of the turns.

Solid, without a doubt.  I came to Wellington after many plays of Here I Stand, and a single play of Napoleonic Wars.  Wellington is different enough from both to occupy its own niche.  It's even more combat focused, and it leaves a lot of room for maneuver and exploiting terrain.  To make it even more combat focused, the cards are much higher CP, and there are tons of ways to get more, so you get these absolutely huge hands.  Most people start with eight cards, and it's not inconceivable that you'll get four or five more from events and loot.  The sides really seem to play much differently, particularly the Spanish, who have tons of troops but really bad troops.  They simply must use their inferior troops to cause enough attrition to dull the French force.  The French, meanwhile, have the advantage of trying to simply slowly retreat and make strong counterattacks when necessary.  The onus is all on the British and Spanish.  Another "slow retreat" game, like [gameid=15839] and [gameid=22457].  I like the mechanic, and not surprisingly, I like this game.

Frankly, I was amazed at the amount of chaos created by card play. I felt as if the entire Iberian Pensula campaign was out of my hands and up to the fates of the cards to resolve.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play. A good game. Sort of a stripped down version of The Napoleonic Wars (naval combat and diplomacy removed, some rules added to relfect the realities of the war in Spain). Like its predecessor dice luck can play an important role, for good or for ill. It provides the full card-driven wargame experience while being somewhat shorter and easier to play than most of its cousins.

A simpler version of the Napoleonic Wars by GMT also.  If you like that, you'll probably like this as well.  This is focused primarily on one campaign of those wars, of course revolving around Wellington.

RATING: 6
A tale of woe where brutal card effects rain from the sky and set the battlefield ablaze.  No strategy will go unscathed, which to me is acceptable because it makes me lightheaded and giggly.

The game isn't short by most people's standards, though it's only a coffee break compared to multiplayer CDGs such as Here I Stand and Virgin Queen.  Those games feel like real-time simulations.

What I like:  A much greater emphasis on combat than most CDGs and a random die roll that can cause the game to end prematurely.

Sometimes painful:  Swingy card effects.  You haven't lived if you've never seen Wellington (himself!) routed off the continent, thanks to a timely response card and a 9-unit kill result.  Put yourself in the position of that losing player and you'll see why some wargamers might not play more than once

But hey, it's all in good fun, and the game can always be called early if it goes off the rails.

The first of this series I played (Kutuzov, Napoleonic Wars are the other games in the series). I didn't get it at first but now I will always play this game.

These games have become a cornerstone for our gaming group, whenever we want a multiplayer game this and Napoleonic's Wars are always suggested.

RATING: 6
Easy going "destroy the world and all who live on it" kind of game. A true beer and pretzels game. Great fun none the less.

Good expansion to Nuclear War, nice to have good population cards at last. Really needs the basic N.W. to play. 
However beware too many expansions/too large a play deck, as it can get too rules heavy for a lighter game

Fun, portable member of the Nuclear War card game family.  Play with tongue firmly in cheek, bluff about your population and expect chaos to thwart strategy more often than not.  Hilarity ensues.

I played the initial prototype of this which was flawed, but the ideas that Rick Loomis was trying to incorporate seemed to hint at a fun and portable version of [i][gameid=713][/i].

I like this little game of blowing up your friends till only one remains or even none. Nice little funny game to travel with - I would like to try Nuclear war now though.

do yourself a favor and upgrade to Nuclear War, Proliferation and Escalation

RATING: 6
This is an expansion to Nuclear War/Nuclear Proliferation, but you can play it also as a separate card game.

As the original game is very hard to get (at least in Europe), you may want to buy one or two booster packs or buy two WMD to have more cards

Part of the Nuclear War franchise.  Good ender, but plays a bit long.  Cannot be taken seriously since primarily luck.

Load up on bombs and bring your friends as Kurt would sing. This game is pure fun, if you're not aversive to bombing your fellow players to massive nuclear death. I like the fact that you get to strike back when your out of people (that go by the millions).

It's more of the same really, except that the Population cards are MUCH nicer.

A better-balanced Nuclear War [some cards can be either warheads or missiles, propaganda 25s are replaced by 15s, and Secrets are no longer totally crushing]. No spinner, though. :(

I love having the new population deck in the same card size as the rest of the game.  In the previous sets the population cards were cardstock cut outs.

More nukes! Only problem is they include only 40 of the nice new population cards which puts a damper on using them if you want to have a longer game and give players 12-15 cards.

One of the best games I ever played.

I prefer the original population rules, but some fun cards to add to the game here.

RATING: 7.5
The "50/50" missile/warhead cards are a nice innovation, reducing the odds you'll get one without the other you need to attack.  WMD also comes with the new-model population deck, which beats the hell out of cutting out tiny cards.   The population and split missile/warhead cards come together in the same deck; you can usually buy a pack of these separately from Flying Buffalo for 10$ (I suggest getting a few sets for those of you who really want to tweak their base games).

Its ability to be played as its own game, however - as advertised - is pretty limited, as it would get repetitive rather quickly.  WMD works best as an expansion to your existing Nuclear War games.

How long did I wait to get a copy of this game? This year at Essen 2004 I finally managed to get it. It is as much fun, as I hoped it would be! Now where can I get the expansions?

Like with the most games of this type (humour cardgames) the gameplay is very watered out and thin. And unfortunately like most games of this type the comedy lasts for about five minutes and then you're left with only... a very watered out and thin cardgame.

Rating based on one play. A fun variant on the Nuclear War game. The small deck increases the chances of good card combinations, but makes the secret cards a little redundant. Of course, it has the non-Euro feature of player elimination, but sometimes you need to get the spite out of your system.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This plays like Nuclear War in all respects. The only innovations here are dual-purpose cards that can act as missles or warheads. This is billed as yet another expansion to Nuclear War, but I'm not all that sure it adds a whole lot, other than the population cards in this set are much nicer than the cardboard population cards in Nuclear War, Nuclear Escalation and Nuclear Proliferation. As a stand-alone, mini-version of Nuclear War, this works just fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nuclear War is one of my favorite games of all time but I found that Proliferation add to much and I never got to play with it added to many times because it confused people with the rules.

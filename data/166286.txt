Wonderful light baseball simulator. Really captures the feel of a baseball game. Some will scoff at the amount of randomness within each game but I see it differently. The randomness is meant to simulate the batting averages of the players. Even great get on base less than 40% of the time.

It is a pretty good representation of pitcher vs batter in baseball. The use of dice seem appropriate as well and I like the variety of pitchers and hitters. So not bad for a baseball game! I'll hang on to it for a bit.

By far my favorite game of Gen Con 2015. Several different gameplay aspects in each part of the game: bluffing, some slight strategy, some luck. The biggest strategy seems to be your initial lineups and bullpen. Not too much skill and a significant luck factor. This may piss off a bunch of losers who can't stand the fact that the best games are a combination of luck and skill, but for me, it's perfect. The theme of the game is present throughout and its affordability ($20) with the quality that's shown is tremendous. Dice Hate Me has a big hit here.

Fun, even though my wife and I don't care about baseball. Captures the do or die last inning spirit well. The real time base running dice rolling is fun. Our favorite thing is the staredown, which we tend to really ham up.

I ggot it for my brother who really loves baseball.  The first time he played, he had a really hard time with the rules, but right after, he wanted to try it again.  My wife likes it ok, but for her, the theme is a big negative.  This one will not get much table time, but the theme and coolness of the components and size of the box makes this one that I will hold on to for a long time.

A great game that is portable, has easy setup and rules and is just plain fun. The components and artwork are a nice touch. The only negative is that I find that the game may be easier for the pitcher.

Wow. What a game. I felt bad about opening the character cards - they came in a foil pack with a "stick of gum" that gives you a retro feel. This game is chalk full of theme. I love it. You really get into the nitty gritty of the pitch by pitch showdown between a pitcher and batter.

Each character has their own special abilities that help mitigate the luck for the dice rolling. Those abilities are attained by the staredown phase - basically, the batter guessing where the pitcher is going to throw the ball.

Component quality is top notch. I love the feel of the game, anyway, but the components add to the flavor and overall gameplay.

The one taint with this game is the error filled rule book. HOWEVER, the designers have taken responsibility and are fixing this. Great work.

Initial Impression: I love the components for this game. There's an incredible attention to detail, from the baseball card characters to the sticks of gum status trackers. The gameplay is an interesting mix of dice rolling and bluff/guessing. You roll the dice to determine how well you hit your opponent's pitch and die roll modifiers are based on how well you guessed the pitch. Just like the artwork, the mechanisms feel very thematic. I'm not sure if it's a regular occurrence in this game but our first game went down to the wire; bottom of the ninth, 2 outs, bases loaded, 2 strikes, and final pitch. It was an tense experience.

Our second new to us game Brian and I played on Hurricane game night. I was offense and won with 2 outs. This is silly fun. There is a good combo of double guessing (which I LOVE in games), special powers (each batter and pitcher gets a special power depending on how they guessed the pitch location) and speed die rolling. I normally don't like speed as a game mechanism, but it works here. I am looking forward to exploring this game further, not only with the solo variant but with different lineups. I think I will probably put this up for Trade as I don't see it remaining fresh forever. Keeper for now.

Fun. Baseball in a small box distilled down to the essence of the game: The Pitcher Batter Duel! really well done, well conceived and well produced. The price point makes this one potentially a steal of a great time in the bang for your buck category. Ive only played it in the solo mode which is pretty nail biting and very entertaining, so I will resist the urge to rate it until I have had at least SOME multiplayer play. But so far its looking really good and the ability to flesh out these teams on down the road (I really hope) and retain THIS level of interactivity and brevity and DEPTH of action is something I am pulling for as hard as I do my Yankees!

SO good right now I don't even want to see this envisioned for other sports, yet!

Lets get Baseball its due and get this one some more parts before branching out, but I can admit that the designers approach to both football (NFL/NCAA) and basketball in this fashion could be well worth the pickup, not to mention Hockey.

Played the print and play version. It was fun for what it intends. The stare down part became tedious. Both games the pitcher won. First game was 1-2-3. The second, the bases were loaded followed by two outs. The next batter crushed a deep fly that the outfielder reached over the wall to pull back. I will likely Kickstart it.

I hope I can raise this rating later with a few more plays. I have only played with my wife and it is fun but you are pretty restricted by what you roll. yes you get to choose your players but after that your dice rolls pretty much determine everything else. I know choosing/guessing the pitch is supposed to feel like a decision but it just feels like its hiding the fact you don't have a choice.

Backed on Kickstarter, estimated Oct 2015 delivery, arrived Nov 19th. Great two player filler game. The first play through seemed complicated at first, but the game ran very smoothly once we actually used the player aids :).

Batter faces of against the pitcher during the bottom of the ninth inning, one run or three outs wins the game. To start the batter makes a line-up of different hitters, the pitcher picks a pitcher to start the inning and a relief pitcher. The pitcher sets their location (High/low and away/inside) while at the same time the batter guess where to wing the bat. Matching tokens gives bonuses/hindrances to the play. Batter and pitcher role die to find results. You can get a ball, strike or make contact. If contact is made the batter and pitcher simultaneously role a die, first to roll and 5 or 6 and shout safe or out respectively determines the outcome. 

There are a lot of cards I need to review to get a better handle, but overall a lot of fun. Components are top notch.

Bottom of the 9th... Probably not for everyone, but I really enjoyed this game. I had a shit eating grin on my face the entire time. The game does a fantastic job recreating the tension in the bottom of the 9th in a tied game. Mechanics are very simple but I had a blast playing it. I would imagine that you're enjoyment of this game is tied to a love of baseball.

I'm a baseball fan, so I appreciate the effort that went into capturing the theme of the cat and mouse game between pitcher and batter. However, the game itself felt very, very random. Playing as the home team felt like I was just watching it unfold, but the game was on autopilot save for my blind choice of inside/outside and low/away. 

It's a better simulation than it is an actual game.

Points for lovely graphic design and capturing the rhythms of an actual baseball game better than Baseball Highlights 2045 (its nearest competitor in the space of "baseball experience in considerably less than an hour" boardgaming) but sadly there is almost no strategy to the game aside from the pitcher/batter staredown (which is itself mostly just a rock-paper-scissors guessing game). Everything that happens after the staredown is a luck-fest. The bones of a decent albeit light game are here but the game is sadly half-baked in its execution; at best this is a pastime for a quick game with a baseball-besotted pre-teen. For a serious strategy gamer, BH: 2045 is a far, far superior choice.

Really fun, really short baseball game.
Simplified, not a whole game of baseball but the last half of one inning. If you are the pitcher you win by striking out the opposing team. If you are the batter you win by scoring one run.

As the batter:
be lower then a ball to get a ball.
Higher then a strike to hit the ball.
Equal for a contact dice to get a hit.

The first time playing, I couldn't help but feel like this game is all about luck. It took us near the end of the game to begin feeling the tension of trying to guess what your opponent is going to do. Not a bad game, but would be best appreciated by baseball fans. Very cool presentation though! Love the baseball cards, stick of gum, and wooden bits, custom dice, and the maroon/tan colour scheme is beautifully retro.

Bottom of the 9th is an amazingly thematic baseball game. I prefer Baseball Highlights as a game, but if you are looking for something that gives you the feeling of the last half of an inning, you can’t go wrong with Bottom of the 9th. Ad it’s short! In 10 minutes you are done and the batting player can play pitcher and vice versa.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really nice game that baseball fans are sure to love.  There are some quirks in the rules, like the inverting of dice rolls between balls and strikes (you want low rolls on balls, and high rolls on strikes), and the rule book itself could stand to be re-written.  But on the whole, it's a quality game that can be played in 20-30 minutes.

A fun little game with good mechanics.  On 2-player game nights, we usually play one game of this, which is usually fun, often with an exciting finish (full count with 2 outs, for example).  But then we move on to something else.  The player special abilities, while nice and add variety, are slightly fiddly.  Nice game though.

quick little two player game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like it as a occassional two-player game, but not as much as I was hoping. It's a light dice-chucking game, with essentially push-your-luck decisions. My daughters really enjoy the Stare Down phase, and I'm thankful that the designers included female pitchers and batters. It made me nostalgic for the days when I collected baseball cards.

As a solo game, I was disappointed. Playing the batter, the only real decision I had was to guess the placement of the pitch, and then I had to navigate programmed machinations of how the pitcher's dice would be modified (on behalf of the AI), just to roll my batter's die to see what happens. If you are interested in Bottom of the Ninth as a solo game, I recommend you check out the videos of solo play posted on BGG first.

Decisions are limited to selecting lineup or pitchers and then guessing pitch selection. The rest runs on rails.

I developed a package of variants to increase the number of decisions for both players: Base-Running, Extra-Bases, and Double/Triple Play Variants.

* I was expecting a real stick of gum in my card pack, just like in my days of Topps cards. I was disappointed. I glued the Ball & Strike Count strip to the field board (where it should have been printed).

** Downgraded to 5 from 6. It's just not holding up.

I really liked meeting the designer for this game and had high hopes, but feel like all the writing on the cards bogs this down a bit.  I get that they're trying to individualize the players, but it led to too much referencing and re-referencing.  I do like the pitch guessing aspect.

RATING: 3
Bottom of the 9th is a blind guessing game, with the pitcher and batter trying to out guess one another. The fatigue mechanism invites double thinking, but most often the batter will make contact before striking out. To help counter the inherent hitter's advantage the game utilizes a 'Run' phase which effectively destroys the game balance and tension. After contact is made both players race to roll a 5 or 6, essentially flipping a coin to determine if the runner is safe or out. Even in the turn-based variant the batter will be thrown out 45% of the time. This causes the lengthy pitching duel to culminate to a five second die race, stripping the duel of its importance. Even more generally the dice mitigation is insufficient and the player abilities are too situational to excite play.

There's far too much dice randomness to even justify to blind bid in the "pitch".  It might as well be a flip of a coin because any amount of consideration given to it will be negated by dice.  The tension really is rather superficial.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really fun game, with pretty solid mechanics, especially if you like baseball.

It’s got some human/social deduction element in the staredown — the batter tries to guess which locations the pitcher will choose, and gets bonuses for guessing correctly, while the pitcher gets bonuses for tricking the batter. Then it also has some great use of randomness with the dice for pitching and batting.

It does a good job of capturing the feeling of a baseball game, imo. Sure, there are some oddities (pitching team wins after 3 outs, despite game being tied), but they’re easy to overlook.

Overall, I’d definitely recommend this game if you like baseball.

Okay. Things I really like, such as the old-time theme and the baseball cards. And few games have attempted to depict the pitch by pitch contest between the batter and pitcher. But pitching is very simplified. The pitcher chooses a location for the pitch. The batter swings blindly at a location. I wish each pitcher had an arsenal of pitches instead.

Love the graphic design and overall production of the game, save for the players themselves. The clique of game culture caricatures is distracting. As for the play, it was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe the solo play mode is better, so I'll give that a shot. For me, I'd choose Baseball Highlights over this one. Harry's Grand Slam Baseball went over better in this household.

Fun little game. The fatigue pitching mechanic makes it feel like a pitcher batter duel. Brilliant. Theme drips with coolness. Great pieces. Box built for portability. This game is light and knows it. No pretensions here.  My rating went up to 9 after many plays because it nails what it was designed to do, be a light quick game.

I seem to rate a lot of "advanced rock-paper-scissors" games a 5. I wonder why that is.

Counting balls and strikes in this game does have the same tension as in real baseball; getting caught out is almost a relief because at least you get to start the count over. Maybe if I were a baseball geek, the rest would feel familiar too, instead of being maximum fiddliness serving a theme I don't care about.

Fun quick little baseball game that does a good job of making you feel the stress of a 9th inning of a close baseball game. I wish the individual batters were a little more unique, but they do a decent job with the variety.

Not much happening after setting your line up. You kind of watch it played since everything depends on dice rolls more than decision making and strategy. Perhaps a future expansion will worry less about simulating baseball and pay attention to the gamers experience.

Only played this a couple times so far, but i very much adore it both as a gamer and a baseball fan. Simulates the bottom of the Ninth inning beautifully and the difficulty of getting on base in general. The special powers are neat and this rating could go up once i get a better feel for how to use them. The artwork and old timey look is also a big plus for me.

Originally I wanted this game because of the looks, and loved the fact they give you fake gum in it. Once I got it an tried it, I LOVED it!

This is a fun 1 or 2 player game that you can learn quickly, and play in normally under a 1/2 hour. I play mainly by myself and break it out often for a quick single player game.

Crackling, light simulation of the best part of baseball - the pitcher/batter duel.  Rules need some editing, requires patience and forgiveness on first few plays.  Once settled, gameplay is high on randomness, but higher on fun.  Stare down tension works great, and strong theme distills all the good and none of the bad of (to some) (like me) a kinda boring sport.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Solid sports game.  It primarily  about guessing what pitch the batter is looking for and which pitch the pitcher will throw.  If the pitcher keeps throwing their ace pitch, they will get fatigued and over time they won't be able to throw it any more.  A quick filler that is an enjoyable game of reading the other player.   

One thing that can slow the game down is choosing a pitcher or your batting line up.  The one draw back to this filler-type game is that the most import part of the game is selecting your players.  There are quite a few cards to consider so it takes a moment a little bit to select your team, especially in your early plays.

I found the solo play to contain too much randomness and not enough interesting decisions. Not to mention that for a relatively simple game with a short rulebook, I found a plethora of oversights and needed many rules clarifications.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My first play was with someone who doesn't especially love baseball.  So... I think the game had to carry the event.  And I think it did, but perhaps not perfectly.

The premise is that you just play 1/2 of an inning of baseball.  So we have an asymmetrical game.  This appeals.  The first bit is the "stare down", which is a somewhat informed game of guessing.  I like this, as it mimics what happens during an at-bat.

Next the pitcher rolls dice.  In this case, I think dice are good.  They add uncertainty to the game, which is a good thing.  Next the batter rolls, which is fine.

But the determination of what happens took some brain power, and the help card that came with the game was not immediately clear.  I think a few more plays will smooth this out.  But initially there was a bit of uncertainty.

Running for base, if you make contact...  I didn't care for the twitch factor here.  I dislike the idea that you roll dice and announce "safe" or "out", in real time.  This means the first to grab their dice and make a quick roll is at an advantage - not good when 1 player knows the rules and the other is still grasping how to play.  Seems predatory.  I may change this to each player rolls at the same time.

Pitcher fatigue - interesting mechanism.  I think I like it.

So mostly good.  I may make a different help card.  And with the running tweak I mention above, the game may work for me.  I do wish the box were bigger.  I bought the two expansions, and everything barely fits in the box.

A cool game but I found the instructions a bit unclear.  There is a vital part of the game not mentioned in the instructions that is listed on the back of one of the cards that come with the game that has to do with what's a hit or not after a pitch.  I've found this a lot with games from Dice Hate Me.  Their instructions need a great deal of help.  Honestly, I still don't know if I'm playing the game properly, but the few times I played it, it was decent.

**UPDATE** 
I ended up selling this.  There wasn't much flow in this game and it felt rather clunky as a result.

Wow, just wow. So, so thematic. Love this so much. Have only played solitaire but the dedicated solo challenge mode is great and you can also play the 'normal' game solo too with a few variant tweaks for the AI. Seriously I've got so into it, I've even been logging stats for all batters and pitchers in an Excel spreadsheet... so I can look at averages and performances just for fun as well. 

What a great game, with a small footprint. Only 'bad' thing is that it's misleading to have the bottom of the 9th inning reference - this game is so fab, it should be played as a full 9-inning experience (which it can be).

It took a long time for this game to hit the table. But when it did I was pleasantly surprised. This is a great little game. Fairly easy to learn. Place very quickly. And has a tension built into it. If you are looking for a quick, easy, fun filled baseball game get this one. My only wish is that the players depicted in the artwork on the cards where different than the people they chose. I would have preferred either Real Sports people or more cartoonish Unknown People. It seems a little bit like an inside joke. That's not a big complaint, but it takes away from the game a little bit.

RATING: 7
There's a lot of things to like about this game, and a few things to dislike. The theme, and the way they portray the theme is really cool. The vintage look is really cool. There's a ton of cards and options to choose from. The concept of the 'stare-down' is really intense, and a cool metagame forms there. Also, I know a few people don't like the real-time aspect, but I really love it. It correctly emulates the cadence baseball has of being slow-slow-methodical-slow-FAST PACED FUN ACTION-slow-slow. However, my biggest gripe with the game is how complex it can get. It's supposed to be an easily accessible, quick outing, but trying to remember all of the possible modifiers gets too tedious for me.

Surprisingly good, especially after thinking it would suck from reading the rules. I will say, however, that this is more of a simulation than anything else. Aside from the guess work that happens at the beginning of each round, it's really just rolling the dice and seeing what happens. In this way, Bottom of the 9th reminds me of 1st and Goal, except this is about baseball whereas that is about American football. I think I might like this one a little bit better in comparison, especially since there are so many players with individual stats that the replay value is fairly high. Still, I would probably rather play Baseball Highlights: 2045 if given the choice. Plus the rule book to this game is horrible. It's completely missing anything saying how you win or lose the game, and certain terminology isn't explained at all.

[b]Bottom of the 9th[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Bottom of the 9th was an okay filler game, basically it is a guessing game between you and your opponent as far as what pitch you are going to throw [i](via a couple of double sided discs)[/i]. You then throw some dice and consult a chart to see what happens. The one part of the game I really disliked was the real time die rolling that happens if contact was made. Each player also has some special abilities which can effect things as well, all though not as much as I would have thought.

Overall this is not a game I'd buy, but I'd play it again if someone really wanted to since it was so short [i]less than 10 minutes)[/i] I could see fans of baseball enjoying it even more since the theme shines through in the production and most of the game play.[/i]

Based on one play: I really did not enjoy the mechanic in this game. You are either the pitcher or batter and you must then try to guess the pitch that is coming which is decided by two tokens. Then the whole thing basically comes down to a dice roll and a strange set of rules on whether the batter rolls the same number as the pitcher or not. It was quite random and not really any fun.

A good game that is marred with a few production issues. It only drops the rating a small amount, but the game is creative in its mechanics and benefits with the small package. I feel the game benefits from it's size not needing a large production value for what it is. The rest of the production is fun and creative with the meeples, cards looking like baseball cards, and sticks of gum pieces.

6.5 - I've wanted a 2 player game that works well for lunch and one of the people I can play with enjoys baseball.  Unfortunately Baseball Highlights 2029 is a bit too long.  Bottom of the 9th is a good fit but while it's very tactical and allows for planning and bluffing, the "Hit" mechanic where you both roll as fast as you can and yell out/safe before the other person hurts it's lunchtime viability.

This is an incredibly quick and simple game, thats surprisingly fun. I'm not much of a baseball fan, but am very much into this. Its small enough to be taken and played anywhere, quick enough to be a great way to occupy wait times. I would highly recommend this title for both its solo gameplay and its 2-player entertainment value.

Great simulation of baseball. Lots of luck but in a short enough time frame. The theme is there and I like it. Need more plays but for now, I got nothing but good things to say about this. Not even a big baseball fan, but I do understand the game halfway decent. **Wife:7

A good filler that simulates the pitch by pitch struggle between batter and pitcher.  A little too random to take too seriously but it has a nice out guess your opponent aspect and speed element once contact is made.  overall one of the better baseball themed games out there.

I have no interest in the sports fandom, but I've got to give credit to this brilliant game! It's fast, deep, and cleverly themed. It shines as a two player bluffing game, but if you're into solitaire and statistics like I am, there's alot of rewarding math for you crunch alone too.

Quite easy to learn (don't know much about baseball so some rules were a bit convoluted for me), short and sweet.
The art, the overall quality and style of the components, as they are presented as good ol' baseball cards, is spot-on.
The theme is not just there... as soon as you open the box it hits you with a baseball bat.

After the initial hype, I have to admit the game is not as good as I stated previously. I still like it, however it is not comparable to some brilliant games.
I still love the art and quality!

not a bad little game - quick to play and once you get a feel for what the hitting card symbols mean it's pretty easy.

Not a huge fan of "dice racing" but it works decently enough.  

So far, 2 plays - both times pitching team won.

Did the print and play version.  Have not played yet, but was in the game store and they had the pack of other players baseball cards so got that. And then in the game store again later they had the box set and I had a spare $20 so I got it. Now I just need to play but I do like the baseball meeples.

The magic of baseball is the duel between the batter and pitcher, and this game mimics that same feeling.

It only loses points because it can get old after awhile.  The replay value is high over a longer period of time, but this isn't a game I'd want to play for 4 hours.  Played once per day, however, is something I'd enjoy immensely.

If you like baseball, this is a good one.  I have a little issue with the way it scores in the end, and there is a lot of luck involved, even if you get in the head of your opponent and do everything right, there is still the threat that you could roll poorly and it won't matter.  But I suppose that's true of baseball too.

After two plays.

I love baseball.   It's one of my favorite things.  Ever.  While this game steers away from the number crunching simulation heavy experience of Stratomatic, it still manages to create a rich narrative.  There is a fairly high dose of luck, but there are two things that must be noted. 

1.  There are a handful of mitigators present, so that the game does not solely rely on chance.  

2.  Ever try to hit a major league fastball?  How about throw a pitch with respectable velocity at a person whose sole aim is to take your head off with that ball after they professionally smack the seams off of it?  Good luck with either of those.  

Baseball is a game of skill, patience, and luck.  Throw in some tension, hollering and respect for history with an eye towards progress, and you've got something that's not unlike this game.

A game that gets by more on charm than anything else.  Very minimal strategy or thought put into this one, at least for the solo game.  It's purely guesswork and dice rolls, there's no actual skill, barely even any choice involved.  But the components are gorgeous, the theme is charming as all hell, everything about the game is incredibly well-produced.  It's just not much of a game.

Played a demo and I was hooked. The Staredown is really fun as you try to read your opponents mind and figure out how they're going to pitch/bat. The simultaneous dice-rolling for running the bases is frantic and the fatigue and skills add a light layer of strategy. Played this a lot in bars at GenCon and picked up both expansions. Haven't tried single-player, will update when I do.

Plays in less than half an hour, but still manages to capture the tension and excitement of the last half inning of a game of baseball. Racing to roll a 5 or 6 in contact can be extremely tense and fun. The overall theme and presentation bumps the score up a point for me.

I know, it's supposed to be a 10-minute filler. But it's awfully close to a totally random game. Apart from "selecting" the pitch (and even then, some of our most effective results came from random selection), the rest is just rolling dice and looking up results. I'm not saying it's not fun -- just don't expect to make actual decisions, because this is not really the game for it.

Solo review.  It's pretty much a huge luck fest. Did you guess the pitch right? And, let's be clear, in solo, you're trying to guess the randomness of the deck versus "playing the man" in a 2p game. There are no mind games, just the randomness of a deck shuffle. Then you roll some dice, possibly apply some minor roll modifications, and if you're lucky enough to make contact ... you roll more dice because you might just be thrown out.  I do really like the theme of the game, and for a small, quick (after you learn the rules) solo game I guess it works. Overall though, it's hugely luck dependent. I'd be willing to try again sometime playing against an actual person.

It has all the theme and quality you could hope for, but there are no real decisions to be made that aren't random. A very beautiful and complex game of heads or tails that seems to favor the pitcher. It was still fun and I would play it again.

I am a big baseball fan, so of course I was drawn to this game. The artwork and components are top notch. It simulates the feeling of a ballgame as well as a small card and dice game could. Selecting the pitch tokens really feels like looking into your glove and getting ready to pitch. Great two person filler while waiting for the rest of the group to show up, and then they will watch it play out!

Actually the Print & Play version, so only 4 batters and 2 pitches.

It's a neat game, is plays fairly well. It feels one-sided at times, and once we realized that the pitcher wants low balls and high strikes, figuring out what the batter needed to roll to succeed became easier to figure out.

RATING: N/A
While this gets a lot of hate, I've rediscovered where it's great - as a party game. Sure, BGG is filled with "gamers", but if you have a housefull of people, and they are people you know, there's really no easier game to pull out and "play". There's a reason why this is such a huge selling game. It's not "good" - in fact, it's kindof terrible with what some of the cards say, but it's also a riot.

It's apples to apples for terrible people.  I'm a terrible person so I enjoy it.  Definitely not for the easily offended.  Not a game I would recommend often, but with similarly minded people who are ok with some very blue jokes it can be a lot of fun.

I had a hard time choosing between 9 and 10 to rate this game. I reserve 10 for games like Chess, Go and Bridge. I went with 9. That said, BUY THIS GAME. OK, don't buy it if you think "Family Guy" should be censored out of existence.  CAH is rude, crude and thoroughly obnoxious. Don't play it with your priest/minister/rabbi unless you know ahead of time they like 4-letter words and bawdy jokes.

Do you already know Apples to Apples? It's basically the same game, but instead of being G-rated, this is more like R-rated.

Example: One player reads "____: kid tested, mother approved."  I had just picked up a card that read "The Female Orgasm."  I laughed and decided that it was just wrong for that and I played another card. However, I laughed and showed the card to a friend at the table. As he was reading it, the next host said: "____: you can't have just one." I took the card I was showing to my friend and slapped it down in front of the host. My friend said "if that doesn't win, I'll give you a dollar."  It won.

Oh, what to say about CaH.  Most either love it or hate it.  It's Apples to Apples, but if it were made by the creators of South Park after their puppies died.  It's a perfect game toward the end of a game night, when the drinks have been flowing, and everyone is a little too mentally taxed for anything else.  But it's EXPONENTIALLY better when played with people who enjoy creative answers, rather than just raunchy ones.

Hilariously fun the first time. But every time after the humor starts to wane. While still funny for a few rounds, my limit is about 20 minutes now. I don't understand people who can play this every single week for hours and still find it hilarious.

RATING: 8
This rating is partly for the customized Print and Play version that my friends made for me and we played at my bachelor party.  

I find the regular game to be okay as an activity, but only if people don't try to play it as a game and it doesn't go too long.

The PnP version is the best way to play in general.  People can write in their own answers on blank cards if they wish, and you have the option to tear up cards that aren't funny/are obscure references.  This improves the game a lot.

RATING: 3
I probably played this under the right circumstances: At new year, with a bunch of blokes, drinking beer. It did provide a lot of genuine laughs and although it's clearly distasteful, I did enjoy playing it. 

That said, I won't go out of my way to play it again. As others have said, there's not really any "game" here - not even a defined way to win - and the novelty value will have worn off completely after one play through of the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I wouldn't define Cards Against Humanity really as a game. It is way to get to know the people you play with (or how confident they are with presenting really f***ed up answers to the group actually). What defines the description of a game even more is that the judge can use any arbitrary reason to pick the winner of a round.

So as a game I rate this a one. But as a past time party activity, I'll give this a three. There sure is some fun to the game and you have to think what kind of an answer the person being the judge that round will appreciate. However, even for this purpose you might not get any chance to play any funny combos if you happen to draw some really lame cards that nobody finds funny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Basically a ruder version of Apples to Apples, making it good for certain groups.  As a rule, the cards tend to be more variable in quality than Apples.  Unlike Apples there are a number of trump cards that will almost certainly win each round.  I think the game isn't as replayable as Apples, but it is more hilarious and is right for certain groups.

It's well....fun, real fun...well, the first 5 minutes. Then it gets stale. Then you gross out people, real fun. Then you bond, sure but then you get to the point were you know all the cards or at least the big ones. Sure you could make more cards of your own, or get an expansion or different version...but isn't the point of the game to be good on its OWN self? Play it, go ahead, you'll like it, then go sell it on ebay. Still, playing it with a very tight group of friends or newbies is really fun

Very easy to play since most people know of it already and enjoy it. I'd only pull out at big parties, not ones with just my friends.

RATING: 5
Another game that I first played at a friend's birthday party.  Now, my husband absolutely hates Apples to Apples, so he wasn't too thrilled to hear we would be playing a game with the same mechanics.  And then he saw the cards.  Needless to say, he loves this game and we are going to have to get a copy.  I love it too - when played with the right group of people - but then I also love Apples to Apples and most games involving words.

But, unlike other word games, this one with its various jokes, can get old rather quickly, and doesn't require any skill to play.  Randomly decided cards can often work better than cards played by some sort of choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Now I can say I played it, at least. It really is nothing more than an X-rated Apples to Apples, with a high quotient of cringe and gross. Good for some laughs as a social activity -- ours was a good group for that -- but as a game it left me flat. In time it got a little repetitive, and it stayed around too long to be enjoyable (which maybe would have been avoided if we bothered keeping score. We approached it as an activity, which was probably unwise).

Having played it once, I don't know how often I'd want to play it again, if at all (which also makes it similar to Apples to Apples in that regard). The first experience is probably as good as it's going to get: a good one-off laugh.

RATING: 7
Great party game that rewards understanding other player's sense of humour.  Quite offensive.  Weaknesses are that the humour is mainly Canadian/North American and the game should provide more blank cards to allow for personalisation.  Also expensive for what you get.  **Update: this is much better now with the UK edition**

The basic entry game.  Very accessible.  Best at parties and while drinking and not caring.  The cards are sturdy, but I would be hesitant to ensure that you are not spilling anything when the cards are sitting on the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love the idea of it and it gets some really big laughs when the cards align just perfectly. Worth it for that but it tends to spiral and get played all night which can be wearing in the wrong setting. Not really a game, more of an experience so pick your crowd well.

Some might say there is not much of a game in "Cards Against Humanity".  I say in response, "So friggin' what!!!!"  This game made me laugh till I hurt!  If you are an uptight stick in the mud, give me your copy of this game and I will laugh enough for both of us.

I had the experience of playing this for the first time last weekend.  I'd heard a lot of good stuff; unfortunately what I experienced was less than awful.

The game is not funny, in the slightest, and gives players the authority to use otherwise socially and culturally unacceptable expressions within the confines of the game.  Its design is lazy and after 3 rounds, with 7 players (that's 21 black cards!) I didn't find even one the least bit funny.  Anyone who finds the statement "Batman's secret guilty pleasure is...Auschwitz," funny is lying, or simply effed.  The laughter was forced and the game overall awkward.

I'll leave you with this analogy: if players wouldn't write the punchline answers in games like Balderdash or Things, then there's probably something wrong with them (the cards) and it shouldn't be used as an excuse to seem 'edgy.'  It's just bullshit.

How about a joke?

OK, what's the difference between a pile of bowling balls and a pile of dead babies?
Answer: The bowling balls are way harder to get into the back of your pickup truck with a pitchfork.

Funny huh? How about another joke?

So, what's the difference between a pile of bowling balls and a pile of dead babies?
Answer: The bowling balls are way harder to get into the back of your pickup truck with a pitchfork.

What, not funny anymore because you just heard it? OK, new joke!

What's the difference between a pile of bowling balls and a pile of dead babies?
Answer: The bowling balls are way harder to get into the back of your pickup truck with a pitchfork!

Now, if I were to repeat that same dead baby-joke one more time, you'd basically get the gist of playing Cards Against Humanity. 

Maybe I'll play along with it if I'm drunk, high or bored enough and I'm pretty much guaranteed of company is comically gifted enough to enhance the experience, but other than that this game really doesn't live up to all the hype.

Just not a very fun game.  Some funny moments with friends but gets stale quickly.  I'm sure online variants and/or expansions make it better but I just don't care for the format.  A subpar party game that is at least better than doing nothing.  Oh, and I'm not gonna record plays of this game because I cannot remember at all how many times I played it and when and I also don't care enough about it to record them and I especially don't care enough to record who won every game.

Cards Against Humanity is one of the most explosive Kickstarter games probably ever. It's great for parties, game nights with friends, or even family events if you're family is cool with NSFW content. CAH is a fun game with lots of laughs, very easy to play too so anyone can pick it up and play.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Sure Cards Against Humanity can bring some laughter to the table... but it's also extremely offensive in every possible manner. I can see how it could work as a party game with the right group of people, but it's really not for me.

Most of the time I find its humor terribly juvenile and really really annoying. The only exception to this comes from some double blank black cards, that allow for some Monty Python kind of non-sense humor. Yet there's much better party games for that... and there's also much better party games around in general. This is vulgar, juvenile, racist, sexist... it's horrible! I really don't like Cards Against Humanity.

"A party game for horrible people." - this game really lives up to its name. The gameplay is very simple: you ask a question (black card) and then the others secretly select an answer from the white cards available in their hands. The the player who asked the question reveals the answers and chooses the one which he considers appropriate. The questions are nasty, the answers are nasty, so the fun factor is high with this one..

A very silly Apples to Apples. It doesn't disappoint (it's always a blast to laugh and to be crude with friends). This is a 10/10 on the fun factor, but ranks very low on my "Do I Want to Play This" scale. One thing that puts me off is that once people start playing CAH, they usually keep going until it is no longer fun.

Pro: Haiku black card returns creative results.
Con: I accidentally vandalized my own box.

The immature/offensive "Apples to Apples." With the right group of people (people you know) it can be a fun diversion, but with strangers, you may be seen as a racist, homophobic, misogynistic piece of human garbage. So be forewarned...

(Check some of the comments from those rating the game a one. If you tend to agree, stay away. If you find them self-righteous and unable to put things in perspective, then you'll at least get a chuckle out of the game. I do agree it is more of a social activity and less of a game.)

The politically incorrect party game; this one works wonders with people not at all into board games. Fantastic for a laugh or two, so long as you don't overdo it, else you'll find it boils down to a couple of winnning cards to be played and replayed.

A very off-colour, inappropriate and vulgar party card game that can bring whole rooms of people to stitches with laughter. The catch is, once you know all the "win" cards, that is: the cards that are so outrageous they'll almost certainly win you the round, its replay value dwindles significantly.
Best played with larger groups who have never played and who are comfortable with being politically incorrect.

Why is this still in my collection?  I liked it at first, but along with many other people, I came to the conclusion that the game loses it's value after a few rounds, and over all, it just stops being funny to make fun of the holocaust, you know.  Maybe I'm not as horrible as a person I need to be to enjoy the game very much.  It's still in my collection because I can't see selling it or donating it to Salvation Army.  It's best left on my shelf, collecting dust as a reminder not to get too caught up into hype.

Play begins with a judge, known as the "Card Czar", choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players. Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an "Awesome Point", and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.

Apples to Apples with offensive humor and pop culture references. Fun in the right type of social situation, but not something to be pulling out regularly as a game.

Party style word game with adult/bad taste phrases. Fun at times, but almost always ends up as one long series of rounds that never end and the game aspect gets dropped.

RATING: 1
As a rule I generally don't rate a game until I have played it half a dozen times or more but I had to make an exception in this case.

"Cards Against Humanity" is often hailed as being the answer to "dull party games" but I would argue otherwise. Humour is such an objective thing and so it should come as no surprise that some will find this game hilarious while others will not and instead find themselves trying hard to act like they found it funny. I am in the latter group.

The White Answer cards are stupid and are so on-the-nose when it comes to the shock value that it's actually pretty pathetic. Let me state clearly however that I am not easily offended and have no issue whatsoever with non-PC topics but I just found this to be contrived. 

There is no strategy whatsoever with the chosen answer usually being the most outrageous rather than the one that actually makes any sense. The game completely breaks down because of this as people choose answers like "The Queens immaculate anus" to questions like "How will we pay for things in the future?" - it doesn't make any sense! How can a uniquely singular item ever be used as a currency!? It is frustrating to see the Card Tsar pick a card that isn't yours (and makes sense) in favour of one that is just stupid.

I can't recommend this "game" at all. A far better party game that has options for creativity and filth, if you want it (rather than it being forced) is "Say Anything". Skip CAH - it's shite.

Here's a great rundown of why that's the case in my opinion:

RATING: 6
A vulgar version of Apples to Apples.  Earns an extra point for appealing to my juvenile and transgressive sense of humour, but then loses it for the fiddliness of its two and three card questions.  Even more than Apples to Apples, this is a game that pales with over-familiarity.  The stark monochrome simplicity of the cards somehow seems fitting. Production quality is good.

Not for the fainthearted. 
If its a good session, then it´s amazing. If its a mediocre session, its just profanities stacked onto of each other. 

My favorite expansion for this game is BEER. Makes it a lot more fun.

"Terribly offensive Apples to Apples." And because I haven't played it as much as AtA, (and usually enjoyed a few adult beverages beforehand) I find this game hilarious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game attempts to take the hilarity of certain situations in "Apples to Apples" (the Helen Keller card comes to mind) and make a game out of entirely those types of interactions.

In Apples to Apples, the humor comes from people twisting an otherwise innocent set of cards. On their own, the cards don't do anything offensive. It's the player's sense of humor that makes it work.

In Cards Against Humanity, the sense of humor comes from the cards, and the player's personality and contribution is basically eliminated. You play the joke, you play the punchline, everyone laughs, you continue. The players contribute nothing; you may as well watch a stand-up comedian together. It's a worse (and less versatile) game because of this.

Obviously, you need the right people for this one. But, if everyone brings the right frame of mind, it's a hilarious alternative to Apples to Apples. (Though the same downside applies to both--the cards mean you need to get everyone around the same table, which limits game size.) Although there isn't a lot of subtlety to much of the humor, a few real gems stand out after multiple plays.

I enjoy this game most of the time. It's good to play with different groups of people to keep the humor fresh. After playing it at just about EVERY college icebreaker it's kind-of lost it's replay value but I'm still up to play. I recommend this game for teenagers because my cousin Jerry (14) literally laughed at every card that was played.

RATING: 8
This game is horrible. I LOVE it! There's a certain amount of guilt that comes from being a straight white male and making some of the jokes that are inevitable in this game, but it's also an interesting tool that chips away at the stigma and normalizes some of these conversations (juvenile as they may be at the onset). 

Otherwise, it's basically NC-17 Apples to Apples, and that's a fine, fine thing to be!

No other game has ever made me laugh so hard. With the right group, there's not a dry eye... or seat... in the house. You just need to forget all human decency for half an hour or so. Just fantastic. 

One of my favorite CAH games was the one we played with our friend's very proper, middle-aged mother. She was aghast at her first couple card draws, but in no time at all, she threw down the nastiest card each round! Hilarious! I guess you never know what kind of naughty fun hides beneath someone's just-so veneer.

This game is atrocious and I use the term "game" very loosely here.  The first couple of times you play it you think "Hey, this is funny as hell" but after that the jokes get old quick.  The only time this gets busted out is if there is alcohol involved and people are starting to lose focus and can't play other games.

Raunchy Apples to Apples. Which is technically an evolution, but nothing that particularly excites me. Surprisingly enough, it's not enough to get around the "dead cards" problem with Apples to Apples. It's all about relative power levels, and there are still the equivalent of trump cards.

Very annoying.  Have played twice; won the first time and the second time I was bored to tears and just waited for it to be over and still placed 3rd out of 6 in our group.  The subjective judging of the winning response depends greatly on the humor of the individuals in the group.  I saw some very clever responses played that would never win because the humor was just lost on those that loved the dirtiest or most offensive response.  Won't play again.

RATING: 2.9
If I'd only played this game once, it would rate about an 8. I actually gave it a 7 initially (after two plays) and the score has been revised down further since then.

Unfortunately, I find this game has far less longevity than similar games like Apples to Apples because the humour in CAH is often too blunt and feels pre-scripted.

There are certainly moments that have made me laugh but many of the cards feel too long-winded or specific; it's the cards themselves that are funny, rather than the clever way someone has chosen to pair cards together. A2A seems to have more room for variety in that regard; it's not necessarily as "funny" but when it is, it is so in much more surprising and witty ways because it allows room for the players' creativity.

Also the two-card questions in CAH tend to be more complicated and slow the flow of the game down too much. Not ideal for a party game unless you're only likely to play it a couple of times.

If you're after a good party game that will actually help you get to know your fellow players, I would instead recommend Apples to Apples (which also has a much larger number of cards), Say Anything or Dixit.

Great party game, wears a little thin when you know the cards or if people are too drunk (for example - on new years)...playing with the "Rando" alternate rule adds a fun and interesting element but it doesn't work all that great if you already have a bunch of people playing...

Unfortunately too much of the enjoyment relies on the comedic timing and delivery of people's responses.

RATING: 1.5
Rating based on a single - mercifully incomplete - play. I can see why people would enjoy "playing" this: Some of the combinations you can come up with are somewhat clever and groan-worthy. 
However, most cards I saw played were either "meh", or of a level that makes me doubt the emotional maturity of anyone who'd find them funny, with the former being the bigger complaint. Truly "awesome" combinations are few and far between, and as they're the only redeeming feature of this activity, I just don't care for it at all.

M-rated Apples to Apples. I do enjoy Apples to Apples and do also enjoy this game. I rate it lower because (i) its un-family-friendlilessness would limit its play range and (ii) set phrases seem to brute force funny responses rather than allow the humor to just come naturally out the reply.

Definitly needs the right mood or at least the right crowd.  On a good night this "adult" version of apples to apples (filled with taboo and edgy cards about sex, violence and race) will get lots of laughs and can be incredibly fun.

The hook for this game runs the risk of wearing thin after repeated plays but it's good to have around on a night when your friends are drunk, full of mischief, and somehow asking for you to bring out a game.

Cards Against Humanity is a great party game. It loses it's luster after a few plays, but it is fantastic at making people laugh really hard for the first few plays. Introducing new players is also always a good time. Trimming the fat is necessary as not every card is a winner and the expansions make that much easier. The blank cards make it possible to create new cards that make people visibly uncomfortable.

Wonderful card game. The cards are hilarious and with the right group of people this quickly becomes a laughing competition. The only downsides are first the fact that some references of American personnas and street-talk are not easily recognisable and therefore usable by non-Americans and second and foremost the replayability issue, so I don't see myself cracking this one open every other weekend or anything. Still, for once in a while, this is a blast of a game :D

Very fun with the right group, horribly bad with the wrong one.  It actually feels less like a game than the game it mimics, Apples 2 Apples, which usually devolves into a party instead of a game.

After hearing a lot of good things about this, we thought we should try it. Found a UK edition copy. Guess you would enjoy this if you understand every single word. We had to play with a dictionary! :X

RATING: 6
It's hard to classify this as a game because the only itch it scratches is the one you have when you're drinking with non-gamers. That said, it can be pretty entertaining, especially with a group of players who are unfamiliar with the cards. On the other hand, it hardly uses any brain power and since it relies so much on shock value the game gets really stale once you start seeing the same cards over again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
Potentially hilarious with a group you know well, revealing with those you don't know well, disastrous with the grandparents.

As a game can suffer from people just picking the most disgusting card rather than the one that fits best with the 'question' that round, but that's not really the point.

For the Brits out there, they now do a UK edition tailored for our much superior humour ;-) ...it's the Frankie Boyle of party games.

Yikes! As if the game design weren't bad enough (cheap laughs, little replaybility, broken scoring mechanism), one of the creators - Max Temkin - is a likely rapist and all-around vile human being.

Reading the silly cards are fun once, but rated low because it's just not that interesting, getting boring quick and will cause some really awkward situations. There are more inventive ways to have this sort of fun. The game is more of a racism-o-meter for your friends

It's funny at first, but once you've seen all the cards once all the jokes have pretty much already been made and it's not really funny anymore. It's just forced humour and bad jokes.

As the years go by I'm finding this game to get played less and less. However, it's an essential part of our collection. Maybe once a year we find a casual reason to break this out.

My teenage brother really enjoys the cards - why wouldn't he?

My rating is more based on the fact this is a party game, and not one to frequent the table. We enjoy the game, we just aren't always up for breaking it out.

I don't like anything about this game, but mostly how it always devolves into awarding not who has the best response to a question in the sense that it makes the most sense, but whoever gets lucky to draw the most nonsensical, raunchy card and pose it as an answer to something completely unrelated.  Stupid waste of time.  Do not enjoy playing this game that people treat as a retreat to their junior high days...

RATING: 5
A divisive game, and understandably so. It's easy to belittle this game "This took no design ingenuity, it's just dirty apples to apples!". But in reality, some careful thought went into these cards. But, like Apples to Apples, it does not hold up to multiple plays, as you are forced to get expansions if you don't want to listen to the same dirty jokes over and over again.

RATING: 7
Not too worried by the off-colour humour but the game does seem to require the players be intoxicated and the humour is often of the non-sequitur kind. This is fine when it works -and my game had me helpless with laughter more than once- but too often I found myself looking at the question and then my cards trying to find an answer that even made sense, much less being outright funny. Some cards are far more useful than others (usually the obscene ones) which doesn't help:- I had half my initial deal at the end of the game because the answers were dull or just didn't fit any of the question cards ("Soup that is too hot" anyone?).

A raunchy riff on Apples to Apples that I've had some big laughs playing.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have a lot of staying power; the cards start losing impact once you've seen all of them.

The "7" is for no more than six people playing no more than an hour.  For some reason, a bunch of my friends are into marathon sessions involving at least a dozen players -- typically, everybody at the party.  If that's your thing, don't let me rain on your parade, but ... man.  That shit just seems exhausting to me.

hilarious and awesome game the first few times you play, but once you are familiar with all the cards it's only funny to watch first time players react.

Non-game that gives you both the set-up and the punchline.  Oh, and the punchlines are making fun of minorities, the handicapped, children, etc.  I presume you are supposed to laugh at your politically incorrect daring but that's pretty easy to do when surrounded by your friends and no one else.

A lazy Apples to Apples clone for non-gamers, drunks, and the uncreative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
This is the adult version of Apples to Apples. One player reads a question then becomes the judge. Everyone else picks a card from their hand to get the judge to pick them as the best answer.

My big knock on this game is the lack of replay ability. Cards will end up repeating sooner then you think, and they become less and less funny with each time around. The first play through of this game is hilarious. The second is pretty entertaining. By the third you pretty much need the expansions to avoid duplication. There are only so many times you can laugh at the Harry Potter's b-hole card. Also it makes for judging to become skewed. Card A played to answer B might work perfectly in the judge's first game, but if it's the judge's seventh game then you've just wasted that comedic gold on a jaded judge. 

My recommendation is to play in moderation and keep the longevity of the game as much as possible. It's tougher to do then you think, because the first play through will be a blast and have you wanting to play it the next week. Avoid the temptation to keep the game fresh as long as possible!

Why do people play these sorts of games? 

It's like, I gotta pretend I'm enjoying myself more than I am for long periods of time while the people around me awkwardly try to make their card combos funny. And that's because if no one is laughing at least a little bit, the entire thing feels even more awkward. 

And then usually the dude that bought the game doesn't actually realize the majority of the laughs are feigned so they ALWAYS insist the game goes on way longer than it's welcomed.

Ugh.

RATING: 9
It's a twisted Apples to Apples with a few interesting mechanics thrown in (like wagering additional cards).  The game still comes down to the luck of the draw for the most part.  There are bland cards (animals & celebrities), offensive cards (the Jews & brown people), and some downright vile cards (Two Midgets S**tting in a Bucket).  The vile responses will usually win, so if you draw the nasty ones you have a better chance at victory.  Though, in truth, it's more about the playing than the winning!  I haven't laughed as hard playing any other game, period.

RATING: 6.5
My friends and I will often laugh so hard we can't talk playing this, however be warned that this is a very adult and non-PC game.  There are terms that you will not want to have to explain to people what they mean.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is off limits in this game.  I'd give examples, but I am hesitant to on a public forum.  Everything from racist, sexist, raunchy, to flat out inappropriate (making light of atrocities) is par for the course.  Think apples to apples but for a horribly twisted sense of humor.

If you know someone that would be horribly offended by, well, just about ANYTHING, be careful playing this game with them involved.  You should most definitely not play this game with people in the group your doesn't know fairly well nor with co-workers.

My only criticism is that if you overplay this game (at like every get together you have) it will start to grow old.  The expansions will hold that off a good deal but, as with most things, overplay it and it will lose it's novelty (and shock factor!).

Look at my Wishlist for things I would trade for.

This game makes me rather play Apples to Apples.  I like crude humor - in the right quantity.  Crude humor, spoken at the right moment when nobody expects it, can be absolutely hilarious.

Crude humor being done at all times is just terrible and offensive.  This game is like talking to someone who curses four times a sentence.

Oh, and it is still Apples to Apples, which is also a terrible game but without the crudeness.  How does adding vulgarity make a game better?

Apples to Apples, swapping the cards for rude/offensive ones.

It was fun the first two times - then it just became a tiresome repeat of things... New crowd didn't help and many cards was so local (same goes for the USA-version) that the fun in them was lost for us foreigners. And adding more cards to something that felt "Meh" to begin with didn't really feel like an option. 

And with less and less parties in my life I decided to rid myself of it and see if I could find something I would actually play instead.

Funny once. Twice? Three times... I don't know if i'm becoming stodgy but though this breathed an instant of new life into the Apples to Apples model, its still not a well designed joke engine. Its lazy, and worst of all, its exclusive in its very nature. See Shut Up and Sit Down's thoughts on it, I agree with those folks heartilly. Let's play games that make us laugh but dont make people feel devalued.

Glad someone else spent their money to buy it in our group. 

It's a really overhyped game. Mechanics are okay, but the humor is crude (at best) or just really perverted. it seems like an amazing marketing team was dared to promote a so-so product. They did it and I am amazed at their marketing skills (honest compliment).

It would be a much more enjoyable game if they designers hadn't gone out of their way to be indecent in every possible way.

This is the worst "game" I've ever played. It consists of being racist or sexist and that's it. There is not even anything remotely close to a fun game you could enjoy besides that. That so many people enjoy to shout out racist slurs just because "it's just a game, dude" is shocking and tells a lot about our society. And this has nothing to do with me just not "having a sense of humour". Some jokes are unacceptable. There are jokes about rape ffs!

The game's tagline says it all - it's a party game for horrible people. Specifically, Apples to Apples for horrible people.

Like A2A, this game loses its humor once you're familiar with the cards - people tend to laugh a lot more at anything card that's new and surprising. This is abundantly apparent whenever a group of CAH fans introduces a new expansion - you can watch as literally all of the laughs / points come from the new set.

The cards, obviously, will be offensive to some people while others will find them hilarious. If you're the type to find this hilarious, I can see why you'd be a much more devoted fan to this than A2A.

Mechanically, this game does have one advantage over A2A in the double-blank black cards. It doesn't sound like much, but being able to come up with different combinations of cards gives it a little more longevity.

Personally, I prefer games that require actual creativity over something like this. But weirdly, even though most of us in the hobby associate the lighter party game experiences like Why did the Chicken...?, Eat Poop You Cat, or even Attribute with non-gamers I've actually found the opposite to be true. My observation has routinely been that non-gamers often don't feel comfortable playing something that requires creativity or roleplaying in a group. That's the real secret behind the popularity of this game: it's for people who want to FEEL funny and creative but not exert the actual mental energy required to actually BE those things.

RATING: 7
I found the cards very funny and the un-pcness actually took me pleasantly by surprise. I'm glad a game like this exists. 

I think I would rank this game even higher since it is the absolute perfect game to pull out with certain people, but it does have a few issues. 

The game has very little replay value. I played back to back 4p games to 10 cards (~2.5 hours) and ran through nearly the entire base deck. There are 4 expansions that are almost required for any longevity, so this game is a significant investment. Seeing particular cards more than once (maybe twice) would definitely reduce the enjoyment the game produces, even if they are played on different subject cards.

The other issue I have, at least with the original, is the deck balance. After a few rounds, it is common to be left with a hand of somewhat boring cards for which there are very rare occasions where they can be used and be funny, so a few too many plays come down to just burning cards. I think the decks need some personal curation to maximize its potential for each specific group, but then someone has to see the cards and paritally ruin it for themselves to do this. Or you need to allow people to burn cards occasionally. Both of these solutions reduce replay value. 

All in all though, very few games are made that generate laughs at CAH frequency - the kind of belly laughs that only something so vile and wrong can produce. If you have friends who like that sort of thing, as I do, it is a perfect game for certain situations. 

Update: The expansions were disappointing to me. I felt the cards were not well-executed. And I have seen the game fail now. But still perfect for certain types so rating holds.

Cards Against Humanity is a more fun and adult version of Apples to Apples and is great to play with a group of 10+ people but gets stale quickly with a small group. The most frustrating part is that some of the white cards are just not funny and getting stuck with a pool of unfunny cards can get boring quick

I don't play much CAH anymore, but I've found that the black cards have great applications for other games such as Say Anything or Telestrations.

Played this enough that the surprise hilarity of the cards has worn off.

That's kind of frustrating for the game's owner.

I have no strong feelings about this game.

It's more funny than most games that are primarily joke-delivery vehicles, but since most of those games are dreadfully un-funny, there's still some difference between CAH and the Algonquin Round Table.

The cards break down to roughly 35% puerile potty humor, 35% puerile potty humor that made me chuckle anyway, 15% weirdness for weirdness's sake that fell flat, and 15% genuinely incisive and funny jokes that made me laugh. Your mileage may etc. Good for a laugh amongst a group of like-minded consenting peers but I'd feel gypped if this ate into my actual gaming time.

RATING: 1
Rather mindless game where the first couple times you play is hilarious. Then when you have encountered the cards, it loses its novelty. The cards are what make it funny (some are just automatic winners no matter what card comes up) not the person. That is why Things is by far the better game in this genre. At least Apples to Apples allows the players to at least have some type of creativity and discussion.

It's vile and rotten, as promised.

Yet it is also one more game of everyone picking a card from your hand to match another, with one player in turn deciding which card wins.

The thing is that there are too many subtle cards that will never win against the obnoxious ones once the group reaches the point of utter shamelessness. Also, there are a lot of cards that just do not fit the way most questions are asked. You cannot answer a question about an activity with an object for example.

Despite the gripes I have with the game, it does have its appeal. Fortunately, I have horrible friends to play with.

Apples to Apples with x-rated cards.  Look, I'm no fan of A2A, but at least you can occasionally try to have a clever answer.  This game just beats you over the head with it's politically incorrect and pornographic answers.
And no, my group and I are not repressed because we don't like this game.  We use much of the language contained on these cards, but we use that language while playing a game of Power Grid.  Because we feel like it, not because a card told us to.  It doesn't make us blush.

Finally, this game is dreadful for replayability.  "Oh, yeah, its the whole Glen Beck vomitting maggots card again...I'll go with pixilated bukake just because whoever played it probably doesn't know what it is."
You might be wondering why I have replayed a game I dislike so much.  The reason is that all my groups of non-gaming friends have individually discovered this and think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  If you found your way to this site, you should know better.

I have given this game a 6 because it can be very funny with the right people or can be very boring. This can be true of many games however sometimes you just aren't sure how it will pan out. Also make sure you don't let the game go on too long or it'll become lackluster.

We play where you can throw away some cards - some cards are just too gross or crass so we get rid of them. Also, if you really like this game you will need to buy expansions because the cards will get really samey. We were given this game and 2 expansions by a friend, I have played the game about 4-5 times and some cards just keep coming up!

Verdict: I won't request this game myself but if the right group is there and they want to play something and I know they'll like it, I'll bring it out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a good game to play with small group (4-6 would work best). Non-gamers could enjoy this too. But my rating suffers because you A) need the right group and B) can only really play this occasionally to keep it fresh. Can be very hilarious to play and those that want to win at the "game" can read people. It's fun.

RATING: 6
An NC-17 version of Apples to Apples.  Leave your righteous indignation at home.

The one new thing it has going for it that really elevates the game is the concept of playing two cards per answer.  A lot of the cards require two fill in the blanks in order to make up the answer.

Instead of just throwing in your best card and hoping it beats everyone else's best card at the moment, you actually have to creatively think about pairing up two things that make sense.

I found these questions to be the most fun, adding a bit more strategy to the game and also cycling through your hand of cards much faster.

This is a party card game for people who are not funny on their own. It's offensive just for the sake of it.

This serves a gateway party game, and features some allowance for creative ideas. However it has little replay value as the game's main punch comes from its shock value. Games like Dixit may provide more opportunity for creative ideas for "less horrible people".

Like many people, I went through a phase where I loved this game. However my appreciation has since waned significantly as you get to know the cards and people just sit and wait for the most audacious and offensive combinations. I don't think I ever need to play it again.

After playing I am not entirely sure why adults would ever play apples to apples after playing this.  Love it.  Certainly gets interesting results at family outings and parties.

RATING: 2
If you need a card game to go blue with Apples to Apples you're quite unimaginative. Plus this game has a very creepy vibe in that even the most politically correct milquetoast people can become incredibly vicious with this game because it lulls them into seeing it "as fun." Not a moral judgment but it's something that just comes off incredibly subtly maliciously manipulative,

This game has 0 replay-ability and is just pure trash. You are better off buying a mad-lib book and scribbling in it on your lunch break. It was an utter disaster, especially when the individuals you are playing with have a deranged sense of humour or just have an affiliation with sunbrera's instead of your obviously hilarious wizards and old people. 0 skill, 0 wit, 0 strategy ... this is not a game, this is a waste of time.

Likes: It's pretty much Apples to Apples but with more fun (and some of them are more adult/dirtier) cards. A jolly good old time.

Dislikes: There are still some dud cards that no one in our gaming group enjoy. It also plays better with the right group.

RATING: 3.48
Crude for the sake of being crude. Clever answers will always lose to the most vulgar. Stops being funny after about 10 mins, completely and utterly overrated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros: Easy to play, can accommodate many players, can be funny if you enjoy this type of humor

Cons: no depth, the cards get repetitive quickly, controversial and offensive humor

CaH is probably the most divisive game out there at the moment. On a personal level, I've enjoyed it. I've laughed and giggled and had fun with it in certain groups. If you're looking for a good party game for a group of people who will not be offended by the cards and have not experienced it, this will more than suffice.

The cards are unabashedly offensive, with no topic held sacred. Racism, sexism, genocide, and rape make an appearance. There is nothing wrong with being offended by a game with these topics in it; it is a completely valid criticism.

Outside the topics, the game itself gets rather stale, as  you move through the contents with blinding speed. The expansions do not add a particularly large amount of cards.

Cards Against Humanity is more an experience than a game. Experiences rarely have high replay value.

The group is what can make this game fun.  I sometimes find the card combinations hilarious but a lot of the time the humor is reaching and obscene just to be obscene.  This game tends to get over played and over hyped so if you like it play it sparingly so you don't get burned out on it.

I don't find anything funny about incest or the Holocaust.

Fun enough as a party activity but definitely not what I would call a 'game.' Played with my much younger sister and her friends. Found that the game was funny, as it is pretty much about who can be the most outrageous and dirty. Overall I found the experience a bit juvenile. Would possibly get a run now and then in the right setting but wouldn't see a lot of table time.

The problem with this game is that the game is funny, you aren't. Humour ceases to be funny when repeated, and that is all there is to this game, repetition. Quintissential diminishing returns. If you want to play a good game like this, try playing Dixit, but encouraging them to play it as if it was Cards Against Humanity. It is genuinely entertaining and results in some horrifying rounds.

In the past i used to be a big fan of this game and i have multiple expansions for it, but after one especially bad game i decided that games that main purpose is for offensive humour is not something i really want to play. 

That being said i do have some extremely fond memories of early university life when we played this game. Lots of in jokes we wrote on cards and played with people, i'll probably never see again.

This game is probably going to remain within my collection for sentimental reasons.

I'd heard such good things about this game, I was anxious to try it.  And I have to say that much laughter should be illegal.  Our friend literally bruised her rib laughing so hard!

The base game is just Apples to Apples, but the cards themselves are a very WRONG sense of humor.  The type of humor that offends anyone and everyone equally.  So check your PC attitude and the door and sit down for a great time.

The downside here could be replayability. To help with that, the rules offer a number of small variants - we especially liked "Rando Cardrissian."  But these will only keep the game fresh for a bit - it becomes clear very soon that you'll want expansion cards.

You can say what you want but "the gays" and "hot people" and "the holocaust" isn't my idea of how to behave as a person, a gamer, or someone that one day will be dying or dead. And will answer for their life. 

Even in a party game. I'm not into the existence of this game. I do believe it should be banned and I don't care that you don't like that belief or feel that it is wrong. 

I feel like the world in general is wrong a lot. And it keeps on spinning and behaving in the same manner. 

I keep on spinning too in my own way, and so far, I've had the right to.

I felt bad after playing Cards Against Humanity. I felt like I was trolling on rottentomatoes.com It was fun in the same way, pushing people's buttons, coming up with something scandalous. 

And it was wrong. Even more wrong than what I could come up with. It was sinful. It was low class. Trashy. And unforgiveable in my eyes. I am sorry I didn't have the guts to stand up and say I would rather just leave early or sit over here than play this. My wife and I both should have said that.

I think there is at least a .8 correlation between how much I like people and how close to my sense of humour theirs is. Cards Against Humanity is a great way of finding that out, and I still think a complete failure to find the same things funny when playing it was a contributing factor to the break up of my last long-term relationship.

This game is mildly entertaining. It gets old fast, unless you load up on expansions.

Offensive humor doesn't bother me. It's just getting old with my group and it falls flat playing with strangers because you don't know their sense of humor (or level of comfort with offensive humor).

A very fun and laugh until your ribs hurt kind of humor to it, Cards Against Humanity is a card game that even someone who isn't a big game fan like my mother or sister will sit down and play for hours. The laughs and fun I have gotten from this game by playing it with friends and family have been memories I will always have for the rest of my life. For those unfamiliar with CAH it is basically a dark and twisted version of Apples to Apples. "A party game for horrible people." doesn't give this game justice. If you want to sit around a table with your friends and/or family and find out how terrible of people they are, you definitely should play Cards Against Humanity.

CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY

SUMMARY:
It's a dirty version of Apples to Apples.

PROS:
• A great party game. Many people who do not play board games will be at least somewhat familiar with Apples to Apples, and the rules are easy enough to pick up on.
• It's certainly a way to get people to break out of their shell in a group setting.
• There are a TON of expansions, and so this game has some replay-ability.
• This game always gets people talking and laughing. The fun of the game is in having the "Card Czar" read out all of the combinations, and it's always great to see them react to a particularly nasty combo.
• There are some interesting "House Rules" recommended in the manual that really improve the base game. The first is the Haiku, where all players produce a haiku from the cards in their hands at the end of the game. This is honestly the best part of the game, from the times I have played. The second is to add a dummy player "Rando Cardrissian", who plays a random card each turn... it is always funny when Rando ends up getting a point because his chaotic selection ends up being funnier than people who were actually trying.

CONS:
• The game gets exhausting after playing it a few times, so its shelf life is not very good without adding expansions.
• Cards Against Humanity is immensely popular, and lots of people like it. This shouldn't necessarily be a negative, but going along with the previous point... if you go to enough social gatherings you will end up playing this game many times, and you will become tired of it. Case-in-point, I do not own this game, and yet I have played it enough times at friends' houses that I am already "over" it. 
• The humor can be hit-or-miss. There are lots of cards that will do well in just about any situation, while others will not fair quite so well.

CONCLUSION:
• This is a fine game, for what it is. It relies a lot on crude humor, which can be funny the first few times, but after a few plays it will be time to pull out the expansions to keep the novelty fresh.
• The absolute BEST part about this game is setting up the "Pick 2" or "Pick 3" cards, and the haikus. It's cute to be able to match one black card up with one white card, but the rounds that involve putting multiple white cards together are when people can REALLY put their skills to the test for some great humor.
• For that reason it is a great shame that the majority of the gameplay revolves around matching only one white card to one black card.
• Ultimately, this is a fun party game that everyone seems to enjoy.

First time playing this, I don't think I've ever laughed as hard in my life as I did that night.

Since then, I tend to either get bored, frustrated, or both. 

I know I should think of it more as a silly activity than a game, but I'm not aware of a more group-dependent experience. Lately, the best it has to offer for me is the occasional chuckle or appreciation of a witty combo. More often than not it's never having the right card to go with the question asked, or the frequent inability to tailor a response the person asking. It's at its worst when the group-think degenerates into an ever increasing escalation of who can play the most disgusting card, regardless of context.

It is actually more of a party activity than a game but the humor in it is crass and great as an ice breaker as long as you don't get easily offended. Not much of a game though.

I'm not offended by vulgarity and edginess. I simply hate apples to apples like games. This is no different. You simply play the most obvious card in your hand and hope that it's the funniest. Unfortunately, I've found that the game really only gives you a few chuckles here and there. 

If you think it's because you need to be drinking to play this game I would still argue that I'd rather play plenty of other actual fun games while drinking.

A decent, adult version of Apples to Apples. Often times feels like people are just trying to out do each other or make the most random phrases. The gem of this game is reading the cards out loud, not actually winning.

[19 Jan 2016] - 3 (5 plays)
Dropped the score on this game again because it's just not that much fun. The idea of combining dirty and incorrect phrases has some laughs but gets old fast. I increasingly find myself wondering why people want to play this game so much. 'Game of Things' at least is open ended and let's people be creative in their answers.

RATING: 3
I don't understand everyone's obsession with this game. Sure, I go along with it when this is the only thing people want to do, but I don't like games that force you into dirty humor. I have no problem when that humor comes out naturally in a game, but this "game" (I consider it more of an activity) feels very artificial to me. I consider it an "activity" because most people I have played with don't end the game when a person has won a certain number of cards, but when everyone is tired of playing the game. I enjoy games that have satisfying and fun endings, not ones where people are tired of playing. I also don't the lack of creativity in this game. Sure, you can cleverly play a card based on some inside joke with a friend, but in the end you are restricted by the cards in your hand. "Say Anything" is a much better game in my opinion as it allows you to create answers...and if you want to throw in dirty humor, you're more than welcome.

I have played countless games of Cards Against Humanity in the past 7 years. Sometimes its been a blast, and other times every turn was eye-rollingly bad, and not in the way the game is meant to be. More in the way that you just cant wait for the game to end. If you play with the same group over and over again, you can likely know what type of response a given "Card Czar" is looking for. One thing that really makes this game worth it is those PERFECT White / Black combos that have you still talking about them months or years afterward like, "Oh man, remember that time we had......"

Missing the point of Apples to Apples from top to bottom, this title loads you down with "wacky" and "ribald" answers, ensuring that every choice is equally "funny," i.e., not funny.  Teenagers probably find some thrills here, displaying their transgressiveness to each other as a bonding ritual, but they're being had: they would bond better over A&A, which elicits genuine quirks rather than pre-printed ones. Anybody else who proposes this game should be regarded with suspicion.  My points are solely for the game's structure and mechanics, which are fine here as elsewhere.

OK, I read about this, and I really did not want to play it, let alone like it.  The game is crude, nasty, disgusting, and a whole bunch of other uncomplimentary adjectives.  But when you've had a bad week and need a good belly laugh or two, this game is perfect.  Hilariously, evilly, groan-inducingly, funny.  I spend most of the game apologizing for my answers, but I still laugh. 

Caveat #1 This game should be taken in small doses.  Too much and you start to feel a little dirty just for playing.

Caveat #2: Never play this with easily-offended people.  It will end badly.

A game that truly lets you explore your dark side and lets you laugh at your and other's dark thoughts. Essentially Apples to Apples for the 17+ crowd, I was not prepared for how disgusted I would be at (1) this game and (2) at myself for liking it so much.

I like to think I'm typically a relatively reserved person with sensible and good friends, but I've had to reconsider this thinking after some of the most vile and hilarious answers came from myself and those most quite and innocent of my friends.

I'm still in the honeymoon phase with this game, but it seems like a winner, as long as you don't run out of white/black cards...

RATING: 1
The game really doesn't offer what I'm looking for in games. It's well and intelligently marketed, but I feel that the fundamental ideas shaping this game reflect the society that made it poorly. The game attempts to minimize agency to spread points (black cards) around evenly; it allows players to embrace the worst in stereotypes and uncomfortable humor, while trumpeting its own progressiveness for including cards like white people; its idea of a hilarious joke revolves around Batman. It's a perfectly designed party game, and I hate it.

This is not a game - it is a box of cards that randomly creates someone else's jokes for you.  If you've been drinking heavily, occasionally the jokes are funny (but only the first time).  Most often, however, the jokes are so random as to be pointless.  I can easily make funnier jokes without this box of cards - and I would much rather spend my time doing this than playing CAH.

Cards Against Humanity is like the loud, crass drunk that you invited to the party because, for some reason, you thought he would be a fun time.  However, like all loud, crass drunks - 15 minutes after he arrives, the jokes stop being funny and you just want him to go home.

RATING: 4
This is less of a game and more of a social experience. There is no "game" here; no strategy and no thinking involved. You play it for the shock value and little else. Like many others have said, it is essentially Apples to Apples for adults.

The issue with Cards Against Humanity is how quickly it grows stale. After playing it a couple of times and cycling through the entire deck each time, I realized that the game rapidly becomes more mundane after each play. Not only that, but there are certain white response cards that will always get picked regardless of whether or not it makes sense with the black card. Where's the fun in that?

After finding that I would only play this for the enjoyment of others who have not played the game before, I immediately sold it. If you can find someone who owns it, is willing to play, and you have never played it before, go right ahead and play. If this is your type of game and you have a dark sense of humor, you will likely get some enjoyment out of this (especially while drinking).

However, is it worth owning a game that will sit on your shelf until someone new asks to play? Well, that's up to you.

This game is okay the first few times you play it. My main problem with it is that, for me, it really got stale fast. If a half-decent 4 or 5 games is worth the 25 dollar price tag than go for it. The humor is juvenile and gratuitously offensive.

I imagine EVERYONE has played CAH, the adult version of Apples to Apples. A fun game... the first few times. It doesn't take long at all for you to burn through the whole set of cards and have seen them all, over and over. Then it gets stale seeing the same jokes. It is a good game for learning the type of humor your friends, or friends to make, have. Plus it's Chicago based!

It's hard to summarize how I feel about this game. I suppose if you like Apples to Apples and like to use dirty words, this should be given a shot.

Also, this game will be terribly dated in just a few years.

I'll admit, the first time I played it was a blast...the second time ok, and after the third time I was drinking just to kill the brain cells which might remember this terrible game.

Let me make this clear, I'm not offended by the cards (although I wouldn't blame you if you are), I just can't stand that every opportunity to be clever or whitty in this game gets trumped by cards that just don't fit.

"What is the woman's secret power?"
My answer: active listening
Winning answer: cum guzzling pac man.

...that's not a joke and it doesn't make sense??? But, because its the most offensive or raunchy it will win no matter what great card you play.

This would all be passable if people could refrain from playing the entire box for 2-3 hours at a time exhausting every card. First to some number of wins should end the game...for the love of God END THE GAME!

At this point I'd much rather play apples to apples. A to A is more versatile and allows for more creativity than its 6th grage cousin who's been held back about ten times.

First we laughed then less, and less and in the end you could hear a chuckle or two, then it was just meh. There are only few dark and dirty cards that will make people laugh and when you see them that's it. You can not watch the same comedy 10 times and have the same amount of fun. OK, except [b]Monty Python: the Quest for the Holy Grail[/b]. Meh party game overall.

Even though this is just Apples to Apples, this is a perfect example of how humor can actually affect enjoyment. In Apples to Apples, you may get a few chuckles in the whole game.  Here, you are bursting with laughter on a vast majority of the cards.  The side affect of this laughter is twofold: 1. The judge is more likely to pick a better choice since the laughter generated is a great measurement, and 2. because you are laughing so much, you don't get annoyed at all when your card isn't picked. The pick two idea is also pretty cool, and allows you to be a bit more creative. The one downside is that you can quickly go through all the cards, which can take away some of the "shock humor" upon repeated plays.

This game is disgusting. Apples to Apples but incredibly inappropriate. I have a trimmed down set of the base game plus expansions, with some of the more American and vulgar cards removed, but not entirely. Fun stuff. After around 20 games I gave this one away as I just don't want to play it anymore.

2016-08-12 : I've always liked the concept of Apples to Apples : pick the right card for the right person and here at last we have an Apples to Apples that actually has slightly better mechanics and has more combinations that are funny in weird and twisted ways, which is exactly what is needed for our group. There were plenty of occasions where I was thinking "I'm gonna keep that card for x, because it's right in his wheelhouse and he'll pick it". Very good game for what it is, an evening closer that makes you laugh.

Funny but with limited replay ability. Kind of depressing to see people laugh at 'jokes' (offensiveness) that you've heard many times before.
Game could be better if played in a way where people tried to be clever, but due to card set it's usually something offensive that wins. Expansions help diversify but are equally more about shock than wit.

I played this. Yes, I laughed. However, it's just Apples to Apples with the only goal being who can achieve maximum vulgarity. I have a pretty vulgar and politically incorrect sense of humor, but this game is just not something I would opt to play when there are so many other good party games out there. The formula for play seems to be: Get a bunch of people drinking, pull out CAH, play a random card because it really doesn't matter, repeat until one card causes awkward silence or until people get too bored/drunk to continue. Meh. It's one of those games that rapidly gets to feel like the same old thing over and over. I rate Apples to Apples higher because I find it more universal and card selection is at least something beyond going for the most offensive.

It's fun and funny. Lends itself well to drinking games, but it is fundamentally *not* a game. This is the textbook example of "Not a game, an activity." For such a "dirty" game, some of the cards require a fairly exhaustive knowledge base. Played with the right group it can be a great way to kill 30 minutes. Played with the wrong group, it can lead to a lot of uncomfortable shifting around in chairs.

Cure for the common "Apples to Apples." Oh, what am I saying? It plays almost exactly like Apples to Apples. But the card content makes all the difference. A must have party game for adults only. Check out some of the variant rules and expansions for increased replay ability. I keep buying expansions for this one.

I like using the cards from this game in other games like Telestrations and Codenames.

It's a party game. A naughty, offensive party game that I love to take out only every so often with just the right crowd. The mechanic mirrors Apples to Apples, but the content certainly alters the social dynamics.

I'll give this some credit, its what most people wish Apples to Apples was.  Its still not really much of a game though but rather a test of who can give the silliest answers which is almost entirely dependent on luck of the draw as half the cards aren't dirty enough to really ever be chosen...at least in my group.  This remains a game that I'm mostly waiting for it to end so I can get to real games.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A naughtier, politically-incorrect version of [GAMEID=74]. Initially quite amusing as new cards are unearthed and shared (the fill-in-the-blank approach is particularly effective), but I cannot see myself enjoying this after four or five plays, in much the same way that I cannot stand [GAMEID=74] now after initially enjoying it. A thoroughly amusing party game for many people, though.

This is a great idea for a party game, but I do have a few problems with it. For starters, it gets a little boring once you've seen all the cards (the Munchkin effect).

Funniness definitely drops a bit when you become familiar with the cards and they lose their shock value, but I only play it every so often so the cards don't overstay their welcome and I still feel that I get my money's worth playing it.

I can deffinitely see why normal, non-gaming people enjoy this. It gives them the ability to say bad things without feeling responsible for that. The cards made you, right? It doesn't have the same appeal to me, however, since I am perfectly capable of saying bad things on my own, if I wish so. The one play I had of this, after some alcohol, of course, was fun, but I would happily play anything other than this, although I would not feel offended if I had to play this again.

I've played this game maybe 10 times. It's pretty fun, but you need the right type of crowd to play it. This game is best played with open-minded people with a good sense of humor who are not afraid of crass or shocking statements (cause that's what those cards are). It is also best played while drinking. So playing this game with uptight straight-laced people with no sense of humor who want everything to be politically correct would be a disaster. Cause this is pretty much the least-PC game I have seen.

What to say about this game? Of course it's not much of a game, but for the friends that I've played it with it has been a purely social ice-breaker.

Extremely repetitive.  Every card is something "whackily offensive" it gets dull after the second turn when you realize its all the same.  Everyone giggles at things the game wants you to think are inappropriate, someone says "we're TERRIBLE!", and you sit there thinking you should get new friends.

I used to really like this game, but boy did it get stale quickly.  It's almost like this game is a crutch for the scenario where you have friends that can't naturally be funny.  Just make new friends, or look in a mirror and string together obscenities.  Best played with 15-25 year olds.  Eat Shit You Cat is a better game.

If I am ever at a bar and want to play a mindless card game, I think this would be my game of choice. Take Apples to Apples x Mad Libs with the most puerile sense of humor applied to it.

RATING: 1
Imagine if a game were exactly the same gameplay wise as say,..Catan. Except instead of trading wheat, sheep etc. you traded something intentionally offensive (people, drugs, whatever). At best, this would be a gag gift sold at "adult" novelty stores. I fully believe that is EXACTLY what cards against humanity is, yet it's gotten away with it and became an overwhelming success. Of course, Apples to Apples is the game CAH copied and ripped off wholesale. I think apples to apples is a fairly boring game, so a game that utterly rips it off and tries so hard to be hilarious (which I will always say is something you just can't force), cannot get any rating from me other than the lowest I can give. Yes, it does play just as well as Apples to Apples, the game it rips off which is already way past its prime. That gets it extra points? Nah. This game gets a 1 not for being offensive (though it tries ever so hard), but for being a blatant copy of a game I already do not like.

Basically its rude Apples to Apples - ok with non-gamers and as a social event, but not a long term game (rating 6 - Nov 2013). UPDATE: The AU version is much better for Aussies, and quite well done, Rating 6.323; May 15)

RATING: 7
4-11 players, best with 6-8

A big fan of this simple game, and the creators have to get credit for coming up with a high percentage of genuinely funny cards.  That said, there are still losers in the pack, and one gaming group I play with tears up the cards that no one thinks are funny as a way of culling the bad cards.  Also, ymmv in general and enjoyment will largely depend on the people in the group.  The straight-laced and morally offended not only will not enjoy the game, but tend to play less funny cards.  Vileness combined with creativity wins every time.  But at least the game does provide a generally good set of tools for enjoyment, unlike some party games that really depend on the group itself to make the game enjoyable.

I was not prepared for the kind of shit-storm of comedy to come out of these cards. Crude hilarity on an "Apples to Apples" skeleton. I admit that I got a laugh from this But when you get down to it: this is a vehicle for dead baby and diseased vagina jokes and the like. This pretty much defies the definition of a game at every angle. Its saving grace (can you say this game has a grace?) is that it never tries to be more than what it is: an exercise in a potty-mouthed round of "finish the sentence". It works for that purpose.

The game was fun for a short time, provided you had the right group to play with.

It's Apples to Apples except that the writers understood how everyone actually plays Apples to Apples. The first game is some of the most fun you'll ever have, just watching the reactions on people's faces as they draw cards and read things off.

Subsequent games are fun, in the same way Apples to Apples is, but eventually as you've seen all the cards the shock value that makes it shine during the first play is gone.

The thing that really makes it take off compared to Apples, is that you'll rarely be hanging onto cards because they don't fit with anything. There is a lot more freedom to make good combinations, and you're more likely to hold onto cards for the "perfect" combination rather than because you can't find a use for it.

I enjoyed this game a lot, until I didn't. 

The core of this game is making offensive, rude, and dirty jokes. Which is fun! But the core of the humor is the shared understanding that the jokes are funny because some beliefs so ridiculous that nobody could possibly believe it. Or could they? When someone makes the joke that "no romantic evening is complete without roofies" is the joke "ha ha we all know nobody here is really this horrible, we just play at it" or is the joke "ha ha, I can't say anything like this seriously so I'll make a joke of it"? 

Somewhere out there, there are rapists playing this game and making jokes about how funny rape is, racists playing this game and making jokes about how inferior minorities are, and roomfuls of people happily laughing along with those jokes.

I have Strong Opinions (TM) about Cards Against Humanity's ancestor, Apples to Apples. Much reviled in recent years, A2A has been largely replaced by CAH at modern millenials' gaming tables, as they've been drawn by its South-Park-like nihilism and built-in black humor.

CAH is good. Seriously. It works, for exactly the sort of group you'd expect it to work for. Most of the time you don't even need to be "clever" - just pick the grossest or most degenerate card in your hand and the judge will gleefully make his own associations.

With that in mind, though, here's my hot take on CAH vs. A2A: CAH, with its built-in jokes and laser focus on edgy, "offensive" humor, limits itself, making it LESS engaging for a creative mind than A2A itself!

In an effort to circumvent this, CAH's designers have created some alternative card types to the basic one-word adjective format that A2A relied upon. These new cards are like Mad Libs - short sentences with 2 or 3 blanks that allow you to add additional cards to your submission, in a particular order. This fails to work because 1. players can have a hard enough time finding one "clever" association that adding one or two more required cards increases the frequency of "dump plays" and 2. at a big table with a ton of people, playing a party game, people constantly fuck up the ordering rule, leading to frequent moments of "outing" themselves as they have to interrupt the judge to get them to rearrange the cards (spoiling the judging process), or else nonsensical and unintended word order. These cards also slow down the game, which is totally unnecessary in a party game like this.

People complain about the often innocuous card selection in A2A, but it's precisely that banal collection of words that forces the table to get creative.

CAH is still good fun, and its own brand of humor can really work with the right group, but I still contend that it's less satisfying to get a good card combination in it than it is in A2A. Half of the fun in A2A was to come up with jokes on the level of CAH in a game that was obviously never intended to support them! (See: "Colorful" + "The Challenger Explosion", a card combination I played once that I'll never forget, or "Loud & Clear" + "Helen Keller") With these combinations regularly coming out during A2A sessions, where is the need for a game like CAH? (The need stems from an absence of synonyms for semen in A2A's base set, I think.)

If you are not easily offended, the first time you play you will have a really great time (and perhaps the second). However, it quickly becomes repetitive. Occasionally somebody will come up with a great answer, which livens up the game, but more often than not answers will become predictable.

The "jokes" of outrageous sentence parings gets old after the second play. Plus, winning is at the total whim of another player. Id rather play Apples to Apples. Because the cursing and rudeness is very grating and ultimately becomes distasteful.

It's funny the first time you play it, or when you play it with people who can possibly make you uncomfortable given your answers (like your Mother-in-Law). But the game really isn't that great unless you get a really big group (like 8 or more) and if you know the people in that group really well, rarely are the responses that surprising. And that's what you need to have to make this game great. You need to have someone you least expect throw down the crazy sexual card or something like that. Otherwise, it's not that interesting. But the first few times you play it, I guarantee you will laugh your ass off.

I have to give this the exact same rating as apples to apples because at the end of the day, they are very much the same. Cards against humanity is just the NC-17 version of the game. While it is good for a laugh, after a while the humor starts to wear thin. Highly group dependent.

Made with care, and it sounds like the creators have conscience and intention behind what they choose to mock. (For example, a "date rape" card was removed from the game in later printings.)

But even when they're funny the jokes get old, and even when you play with basically decent people, awful things get said and done.

RATING: 5
I quite enjoy this game because of how dark the game is with nothing held back to try and get a laugh. The game is best with close friends who are willing to laugh about anything even if its very politically incorrect. The only thing is that once you have played a few times you have seen all the cards and it gets a bit repetitive until you bring it out in a new group.

I saw a comment about CAH on line; "Don't play if you can't handle jokes laced with any of the following: racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, child abuse, school shootings, incest or abortion".

This then, is a game that posits that there is a context in which these things can be funny.  Mmmmm.  There may be a context in which the phrase 'coat-hanger abortion' is acceptable (emergency room in a hospital perhaps)-but funny?

"It's more shocking than funny.  That's what makes it funny."  Nah.

And further, it's not a good game.

So, strangely, despite the silly/adult themes, this is actually a more solid game than Apples to Apples, the game it's basically ripping off.  It ends up being more fair and balanced, and not in the Fox News sort of way.  In Apples to Apples, it's rare to find a game where people are playing "correctly" the way it was designed to be played; the winner of each round tends to be just whoever happened to have the funniest card, or some other equally irrelevant criteria.  But in Cards Against Humanity, *everyone* has the funniest card.

Simple "fill in the blank" game.  Dirty humor and shock factor carries the game, and only for a limited number of plays.  

I will only play this with a select few people, and typically for a very short amount of time. When suggested, I cringe and try to counter. 

I'm definitely not beyond dirty/crude humor, but Joking Hazard does it in a much better way, though it'll ultimately wear thin in the same way that Cards Against Humanity did.

While this was fun the first few times, once the cards have been exhausted it's really rare to see anyone come up with any creative jokes. I don't really care that it's offensive but seeing "a big black dick" get played in the same hand as "a bigger blacker dick" is only funny once. Also, it's kind of depressing having to explain the Rwandan genocide to people during a party game (seems to happen every time I play).

This is a kickstarter rehash of Apples to Apples with an adult twist. There isn't a whole lot of depth to gameplay, but it is highly entertaining with the right combination of cards and company.

If you feel that Apples to Apples gets monotonous with the seemingly demure answers, Cards Against Humanity is a refreshing change of pace. The adult humor revitalizes the game with its inherent obscenity.

I'm very torn about this one. It can generate some very funny moments and even the awkwardness and nervous laughter can be enjoyable to a degree. But the cards themselves are very hit or miss. I love the ones that aren't inherently vulgar or attempting to be funny. The humor from the way things like "Miley Cyrus" "Black People" and "Grandma" get put into off-the-wall sentences can be very funny, almost reminiscent of the off-the-cuff answers people give on Family Feud or something. However, the desginers' attempts to be overly crass or make a joke on a card itself often fall flat with me. I think about 50% of the cards in this game could be thrown out and what was left would make for an enjoyable activity. Notice I don't say "game", because it surely is not that.

Watch people playing this. They laugh at first, then as time goes on they laugh less. Eventually those laughs turn into embarrassed sniggers. And then silence. Yes, it is honest about how offensive it is but what it doesn't tell you is that you will abdicate your responsibility when playing it, you will become a bystander to the game and for me the whole point of playing games is that your choices are meaningful. You can be offensive playing apples to apples and create the same game, but it becomes your choice, using your brain. I know this opinion is not cool but I feel compelled to say it and I hope that this becomes an Emporer's new clothes situation where people actually think about what they are playing.

I have the base plus 5 expansions...and handwritten cards...need to purchase more blank cards.  Lots of fun, need to edit the card selection somewhat to keep it current, but I like leaving a few "oldies" to mess with younger players.  

Need to pay attention to who is around when playing as there is a lot of offensive/explict terms and concepts.  Can be a good ice breaker or filler, but is sometimes difficult to stop playing.  My RPG/boardgame Meetup group that meets in a community room tends to finish our 'Meet & Greet' events with this game.

NOT for young children...and not something you would play around small children.  This is basically the (very) dirty version of Apples to Apples, although more fill in the blank.

Cards against Humanity begins as a fun experience in a very casual setting with a lot of laughs. Soon, though, you see most/all the cards, and then most of the jokes just aren't that funny anymore.

(02/20/2016) Comment based on a handful of plays.

This is a silly, risqué card drafting game perfect for larger  parties, and certainly not for the feint of heart. "It's Apples to Apples for Adults." The questions and the corresponding answer cards suggest combinations that range from offensive, tasteless, crude, to just downright horrible. If the party is in the right frame of mind, this can be hysterical, especially if this is late at night. Eventually, the jokes run dry, requiring more expansions to keep the humor fresh. No matter what, the players are all going to burn in Gamer Hell. You will never feel "clean" ever again. :devil: Rating: "5".

I initially rated this game a 9 because I had so much fun playing with my best friend and her wife. But I think a major part of that was who I was playing with because with other groups of people it isn't necessarily as fun. Also, the more you play games like these, the more familiar you become with all the cards so the combinations become less funny over time.

So, initially a higher rating but just doesn't have staying power, even if you keep buying expansions.

Yeah, okay, this just isn't my style at all.  You have a lot of cards and you're supposed to match them with another card, Apples to Apples-style, in order to make some kind of objectionable joke.  A lot of the jokes it encourages you to make are just kind of gross, which doesn't especially appeal to me but fine, but it also nudges you toward racist jokes, rape jokes, etc.  Compounding the issue is the fact that you are forced, by the end of the game, to play every card. Okay, so occasionally there is something genuinely funny, but... it's not worth it. Not for me, anyway. (1 play)

CAH was fun when I first got it at a friends recommendation, and some of my other friends really wanted all the expansions, so we picked them all up.

Cards Against Humanity is a game that's only as good as the players involved.

RATING: 5
I think sometimes the shock humor can wear thin.  I also think there are a few cards which because of the content are just 'funnier' and more likely to win.  

This is an occasional play in our house.  The most fun I've had with CaH is making up our own white cards specific to our friends and in-jokes.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First play 10/10, and with every game, it drops a rating. It's basically a dirty joke machine, but at some point, the game tells you the same joke with minor alterations every time. Sadly, hearing a Joke a second time never works out.

Still think it's a good one to have in the collection. It's an emergency switch if a party gets lame and more of a party activitiy than a game.

I have never agreed with stalwart defenders of the "humor is the weapon of the oppressed" crowd. It strikes me as an easy way to excuse a lack of sincerity, and an unwillingness to seriously engage with difficult issues.

Thankfully, this game doesn't even have that defense to muster. It's pure vicious mockery, and a thinly veiled excuse for people to let their most disgusting opinions fly free with an easy cover of the cards making them do it. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, and it's mechanically boring and uninspired.

I get that CAH as a company have done some fun things, but I cannot get behind any company who has this pile of adolescent trash as their namesake product.

I try not to judge people by their taste in media anymore, but if you enjoy this game, I sincerely believe you should take some time to question why you enjoy it, and what that says about you.

This game is a substitute for an actual sense of humor. Instead of coming up with something funny on your own it does it for you.

Also, the base game doesn't have enough cards and the shock value gets old real fast. There's only so many times "two midgets ______ing in a bucket" is going to be funny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first time of playing this, it blew me away. Absolute hilarity and always eye opening when playing with more conservative types or different generations as you really get to see their true selves. The cards are brutal and offer countless possibilities for despicable thoughts. Definitely not for the faint hearted. Ground-breaking NSFW card game that inspired a whole genre of game. Where it falls down is the replay-ability factor with the same group due to learning the cards. Definitely a must own though.

RATING: 3
Yes, it was kind of funny to play. The FIRST time. 

Call me old-fashioned, but shock humor just doesn't cut it for me, especially when that's the only thing that something (in this case, a game) has going for it. 

I love a good dirty joke now and then, and black humor is right up my alley... but it's a seasoning. You have to sprinkle it and use it sparingly for it to maintain it's potency and effect. 

This game takes away the wit and creativity available in Apples to Apples, while maintaining the same frustrating card draw luck, and the same exact gameplay that does not age well. The one positive I found was the different judging cards (the combo cards, and more interesting questions vs. just an adjective). 

I've played it about 3 or 4 times and I'm just hoping people don't bring it out at any more social gatherings. PLEASE. Make it stop. 

Update: it hasn't stopped. But, I have found a way to have more fun with it: I play random cards from my hand without looking. In 3 games playing it this way, I've won twice, and was one card away from winning the third time. I do this to prove a point: there is no "playing" this game; it plays you. 

Update part 2: it still hasn't stopped. And it has only gotten worse.

Apples to Apples Beavis and Butthead edition. This is the game for you if you think that non-sequiturs about sex organs and casual racism are funny. Don't get me wrong, I'm not objecting to the content on moral grounds, to me it feels way too forced to actually be offensive. In general I'd say that it just feels like it's trying way too hard to come off as edgy and dark but it actually just comes off as stupid and a little bland.

The very definition of a mixed bag game. I like a lot of CAH - I think pub games like this are a lot of fun, and can really break the ice and get folks talking and make them more comfortable.

Though 'Two Midgets Shitting In A Bucket' and 'Being a Motherfucking Sorcerer' will forever be the greatest cards ever drawn in any game ever.

While it's popular in some circles to hate on Cards Against Humanity, my dislike of the game isn't due to any sort of "gamer elitism" or being a victim of having the game dominate game night and steal others away from trying new games (though I have seen that happen). It's that the game no longer stands out in the sea of Apples to Apples clones. It only has repetitive shock humor to offer and lacks the unique rule twists of newer games in the genre. It's boring, which is way more odious than being offensive.

Fun! Great party game.

Replayability isn't as high as other games, but it's still fun to play every once in a while. [Edit: Reducing from an 8 to a 7.]

Here's an entertaining variant: every so often instead of reading the black card first, ask the rest of the players to select a white card first, *then* read the black card. The result is usually hilarious.

It's definitely a situational game.  And not for the easily offended or Puritanical player.  Think R-Rated Apples to Apples, and you have about the right speed.  Although some might think an R rating is not sufficient.  Anyway, if you want to laugh at crude nonsense wrapped up in a game, this might be for you.  Some might be aided by the consumption of mind-altering substances, but your mileage may vary.  Drink responsibly and all that.

Ok game for a party game. Superior to Apples to Apples, but still too subjective to appeal to me (a judge decide which card won, at least each card is submitted anonymously). I’m going to sell it now (perhaps I will get it again later). The game made me laugh (which is the point) but I still prefer many party games over this one. Its main advantage is the grotesque/humorous/inappropriate theme. This is the best game of its class, most friends love it.

Lots of luck on this one, the player with the most curse, sexual cards will win. No strategy at all, just let it go and have fun. Perhaps a little pricey for what it offers.

I will play it if requested, however I don’t want to play it often.

Definitively, I don’t like this game. I will do my best to stay away from it and, now, I know I will never buy it again. The subjective-ness is the deal breaker for me.  The theme doesn't bother me.

Fun the first time you play, but the replayability is quite low because you will be expecting most of the cards. Most of the humor benefits from the shock value of playing it for the first time.

2014-09-20 - The game is some of the best fun I have ever had the first few plays.  As you become jaded, however, the shock and awe of the cards wears off.  This can be alleviated by injecting booze, expansion cards, or new players into the mix (or all!).

Definitely have to have the right crowd and while it may seem like fun at the time playing for a drawn out session really begins to make the game take on a feeling of sameness, which is not fun.

Never fails to bring a blast of laughter with my friends. Can't ask more than that from a party game. 

This does not rate higher than other party games, but the laugh factor that this game can bring is just as good. Many people look down on this game, but hey, this game works. I would get annoying to play this game over and over again with my casual friends, but certainly this one works with them and I would try to build them up starting with this.

Genuinely defies description of a game; it's a random offensive joke generator with a winner. Demonstrated itself to be flawed when I won two rows in a round with blind draws from the top of the deck. The second time was a Pick 2 round, no less. The "game" jumped the shark some time ago for me, but quite a few people I know just can't get enough. Best in small doses, well after the kiddies have gone to bed.

Dirty Apples to Apples. It's fun, but after you see all the cards, there aren't a lot of surprises.

Dropped my rating to a four for the above reason. Novelty wore off quick.

RATING: 6
owned and got it for our wedding. Love the game... it's apples to apples... but Adult late night. The problem I have with it and why it's so low is that there are maybe 25% of the cards that are epic, then there are 25% more that may work in a given situation to be epic, then there are 25% that are meh... I guess that wins, and lastly there are 25% that just aren't... anything... they're a waste of cardstock. Overall it could be more offensive and demonized if anything and I've found that if the game allowed you to make your own it would be much more impactful. Especially if you could have cards as simple as the name of the playgroup you are in. I actually think I will take out the cards that suck someday, Make a bunch of my own and I think it would be better... IDK I just don't feel there are as great as they could be.

RATING: 9
ADULTS ONLY!

Pick the best answer for the question from the ten you have in your hand… though some answers are just so ridiculous they will be automatic winners and some are so lame, you think they are padding or there for the tame.

PLUS: great party game for lots of people, the more ridiculous the better
MINUS: no good for the prudes, the lack of humour, and not for children under the age of 18 (mentally, that is)

IMPORTANT!! If you are from another country, order that base set instead… since the politicians would be more appropriate as jokes than Obama and Palin.

However, if you like to enjoy the company of your friends while laughing at what's wrong with the world, this game is great.  I can see this one being "pulled out" a lot more often.  Vagina.

Exactly as it sounds.  You should feel like a greasy slimeball after playing this if you're a guy, or if you're a girl you should feel like a promiscuous floozy.  Garbage in, garbage out, I always say.  Watching someone get embarrassed as they are coerced by others to read the cards and compromise their values and personal decorum isn't funny to me.  Shock value isn't humor or comedy.  Watching people I've respected for decades get red in the face as they say things I've never heard them utter, while everyone else laughs at their discomfort, has no redeeming value.  The only people who think this is okay, are deplorable wretches who want to drag good people down to their level of depravity in a fun, non-threatening way so that they can quasi-validate their own perverseness.  Maybe that's reading into it too much, but crap if it doesn't feel that way.

Played this game with my mother-in-law, a pastor. It was way more fun than I thought it was going to be. Good thing she's so open-minded ("a bleached asshole?!"). If you can handle it, this is the logical evolution of Apples to Apples that you can play with anyone with a grown-up sense of humor. I'm keeping it clear of my mom, though. It is a 100% ripoff of Apples to Apples, though, and don't expect it to add anything that wasn't already in that game. It really gets your guard down, and made for a very fun start to our Christmas visit.

Essentially, this is a crude, even obscene version of apples to apples.  It is purely a party game for a bunch of people with a twisted sense of humour.  The first time playing, some of the cards are quite funny, perhaps because of shock value.  By the second or third time, it gets somewhat repetitive, unless it is a whole crowd of new people.  Probably great for people who have had a few drinks...

This seems like THE party game to bring out with a group of friends these days, especially if there's alcohol involved. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who has not heard of Cards Against Humanity at this point. It is a very fun (and funny) game (especially while drinking), and it is at it's best when playing with people for the first time. The base set gives you a ton of cards, but some of them are kind of dull, and you hate getting stuck with them, which can make the game a bit annoying. However, when you have the right cards this game is a BLAST. Everyone gamer above 18 should have a copy of this in their collection.

DEFINITELY not for the easily offended!

Don't get me wrong, I like Cards Against Humanity. The biggest flaw in this game is the same as Apples to Apples, its much tamer brother-in-law: You will generally win rounds with the favorite, most offensive cards in the set. The other 80% of the cards are filler that just slow the game down and have people begging to reset their hands.

This is a great ice-breaker at parties or gathering. But, be mindful of who you're playing with, you can offend someone really easily with this game.

Concept is fun enough that I'd suggest everyone play it once with some close friends. And then never touch it again or you'll ruin the fun memories you could have made with the game.

There are all kind of problems... cards made just to offend, "OP cards" that simply always win, luck of the draw meaning that a dragged out game becomes less exciting (since you'll only have the sucky cards left), repeated answers/questions are just not as funny, etc.
But the biggest issue... the game doesn't make your friends funny. If you play a game like this, it would be awesome if the cards were simply guideposts, pushing your friends to make something cool with the stuff they're given. Players would be rewarded for presentation/execution, properly evaluating the judge's taste and adjusting their performance to suit those tastes, etc. CAH though... seems to do the exact opposite. Your friends become sideline characters, just means to deliver the cards on the board with their one punchline...

I played this game for the first time and will not be playing it again. The humour gets old after a couple of cards and the game goes on for way to long. Its a lot like Munchkin in the sense that once you have seen all the cards they are no longer funny and some cards are clearly over powered and will get laughs regardless of what question they are played on. Not really a game just an exercise in random card draw. I'm grateful that I never brought this game and only played a friends copy otherwise it would be on the trade list.

A magic circle for people who enjoy rape jokes, people who don't actually enjoy rape jokes but are being ironic, and people who are upset by rape jokes but are under social pressure to play a game. Would not look out of place as a pre-ethics-committee 1960s psychological experiment.

The first play is hilarious. The second, if with a new group, still pretty funny. Afterwards, with too many sessions around each other, this game becomes repetitive. Using the blank cards is nice, fun. The Canadian subsyitute cards are a good thing to have and the company is on the right track

Adult Apples to Apples. Like that game, this one too gets old after a few plays. Faster even than A2A, since the shock value of the cards is gone after seeing them once. Still, it's fun and humorous.

RATING: 2
Barely a game.  If you love MadLibs, you'll love it.  This is boring, predictable, and tiresome.  "Edgy" in the most "offensive" of ways.  Seriously, it's just a R Rated version of Apples to Apples, which is just an awful game.  It reminds of things like "Adult Monopoly" where the street names are replaced with "Oh so naughty" names like "Orgasm Ave", but it's still plain old Monopoly.

RATING: 6.6
One of the original games that became cool and acceptable to bring to social gatherings or parties without first labeling yourself a "geek".  Can be played with any number of people however the game gets spread too thin after 9 people or so.  At that point you might as well break the people off into multiple groups, which you could do with the single game.  Plays just like apples to apples but the content is much darker and has a definitive adult theme. There are plenty of expansions both official and unofficial that will breathe new and longer life into this game.  Normally I'm willing to play at a party, if only to get people in the mood for other games.

My main complaint about this game is the use of curse words. Some cards have elegant implications and others don't even try. This is strictly my opinion. Otherwise, great game that burns time and causes a lot of laughter.

Is super fun and hilarious the first few games...after that it starts to lose it's appeal. Only problem is that there are always people begging to play it all the damn time. It's an adult version of Apples to Apples basically which was another overrated and overplayed game that's been around since the 90s. It's frustrating when people pick matches that don't even make sense just because cards are funny. I just really have a love/hate relationship with this game, but it's a game I'll continue to buy expansions for and keep in my collection.

Apples to Apples for adults. Game is as funny / awkward as the people that play it. Not recommended for anyone that is easily offended or doesn't have a good sense of humor.

This game was great at first, but there surprisingly is a limit to how many tiny dick and hitler jokes you can make. No I do not want the expansion, because I'm sure there will be a limit to big black dick jokes too. Also it spawned a ton of clones which...really? Who cares at this point.

Terribly designed party game. Most combinations don't even work, or barely do so. People usually win rounds uncontested, as more than one working combination is a rare occurrence. Also, some cards are completely one trick ponies, which will only be funny the first time they're played. It's not "a party game for horrible people", but rather "a horrible party game", full stop. The rulebook is amusingly written, though. I laughed more reading it than playing the game.

Good party game for some good laughs with friends. Definitely a light game. Luck is one of the keys to winning, although you might be able to pull out a card that trumps the others every once in a while if you are creative or know the group well enough to reference an inside joke or something like that, so it isn't ENTIRELY luck based. You can be sure that a good time will be had by all with this game, although it definitely doesn't scratch that competitive itch.

RATING: 6
A totally un-politically correct game where a black card with a question, or a sentence with a blank space, is drawn by one of the players and the rest of them try to make the most funny, crazy or horrible answer possible in order to get awesome points, which are gifted by the player who drawn the black card.

I think the game gets better played with very close friends, so you know no one will be offended by your crazy answers and you can just go wild and unleash your inner demon hahaha (not to mention that it gets even better with a good provision of beers). 

If you play this game expect racial, religious or sex jokes (very explicit jokes), so this game is not recommended for people that can not handle that easily.

I don’t usually play party games, but I been enjoyed this one so far. I think it can get repetitive if you play with the same group many times, but the possible combinations are a lot, and part of the fun is to see people reactions, so bring new people to the game will refresh the experience for sure.

Highly derivative of Apples to Apples. However, rather than the somewhat subtle humor of absurd card combinations that come up in Apples to Apples, derives its humor from the most offensive sets of cards possible. Can be amusing for a play or two, until you realize how unoriginal the jokes are, think about how the offensive jokes could actually be off-putting to some players, and realize that there's really no game here, just an activity to try to lazily make somewhat poor, unoriginal, slightly offensive jokes.

Played once, 7p.  This is a party game; really, a DRUNK party game, i.e. you need to be at least a little inebriated to really find it amusing, I think.  This falls into a category I call "non-games games," since it's really not a game at all, but a social exercise.  Again, I am not in this games target audience, and I don't feel it's TERRIBLE, but I have no interest in playing again (for the most part...).

Cards Against Humanity is a pure fun and evil card game. With similar mechanic to that of Man Bites Dog the game aims to create the most wacky and crass stories/ sentences you'll ever had heard. This game is definitely not for children and most younger teens with it's highly adult themed content. But don't let that discourage you, this card game seeks to entertain almost every group situation with no skill needed. I would gladly open up the deck in casual large group parties or small group sit downs, depending on the people (not suitable for grandma). Given it's limitability by age group I give this card game a 7/10!

This game is hilarious; but after years of playing and watching others play, it gets dull and tiring because you eventually have heard almost literally every possible good combination- unless you buy a surge of new expansions, which, can breathe the game new life because some cards are naturally funny ("separate drinking fountains for dark elves" really made me love the game again) but this game does lose to games like Snake Oil and Bucket of Doom due there being more variety of decisions to make, and whenever you combine the debate into it, those games can really outshine CAH because the player themselves actually will have to use some creative thought. This game will always be a gem, but... I believe the other two games I've mentioned actually can help IMPROVE SOMEONE'S SENSE OF HUMOR AND STYLE.

This is one of those games that I either love or love to hate, depending on how recently I've played. If I'm a few drinks in and someone brings it up, I'm probably all in unless we have better games on hand. This is a great Gateway Party Game for friends that might not be too into board games. Everyone knows this, and most people have a "Oh, man. BEST ANSWER EVER!" story.

Irreverent, offensive, outrageous and very controversial. Yes, I know it is supposed to be this but although some of the cards and answers were funny I did not like some of the combinations. This game includes things I do not want to joke about so I will not be playing it again.

Used to rate this game higher, but I think that I've become fatigued from playing it too much.  Just doesn't have the punch it used to.  Also very difficult explaining what "Smegma" is to someone who doesn't have 100% grasp on the English language.

RATING: 2
We just didn't find this funny. I'm not sure if it is because our normal conversations are quite risque normally but the cards were generally quite tame. You would also have to play a number of rounds with "meh" answers before you would find something genuinely amusing

RATING: 7.5
Type: Crass card-based, mildly competitive card game. Not for the prude!

Best With: 4-10
Weight: light
Duration: 60+ minutes (however long you want it)
Group Notes:
Raunchy card-based game.
About as easy and fun as it gets for an informal group game.

Cards Against Humanity is a card game best played with 5+ players. In each round, 1 player draws a card which has a question or blank in it. Each other player than plays a card from their hand of 10 cards that best (or worst!) fits that question or blank. The active player then reads the choices, and picks the one they like the best. The player who played that card gets a point, and the rounds repeat until someone passes the point threshold for winning.

This is a blast of a game to play. The answers are crazy, vulgar, disgusting...and absolutely hilarious. This is the sort of game that appeals to my dark sense of humor.

One downside to this game is the fact you do have to be careful that your gaming group can handle the subject matter of the cards. This is a game that appeals to people with a dark sense of humor and who know what things like queef, 2 girls 1 cup, and bukkake are (or who won't be turned off when the rest of the group explains them!). If you have people who will be too off-put by the subject matter, the game can become uncomfortable very quickly. Also, this game really can't be played in public areas.

Another downside is if you play this game too much and see all the cards, or most of them, this game does get a bit less interesting. Some of the best moments are when you see new cards you've not seen before being used in completely unexpected ways. But once you've seen all the cards, not many things will actually surprise you anymore. So playing this game should be done in moderation.

Similar games in my collection: Joking Hazard (raunchy punchline card game), Say Anything (free-form party game with many laughs), Star Fluxx (card-based fun, light game)

If I understand the rules, this is more of an activity than a game, hence the '1' rating. As an activity, the fun will vary as much as the personalities with which you play it.  I enjoy games like Apples to Apples and Dixit and it seems like the oft-implied inhumanity (depending on your group) in playing those games is better than being hit over the head with it in this one.

Having removed the americanised and really offensive cards this still works really well as an apples to apples substitute. Some combos don't really work but usually it's hilarious. We play it so you can dump unwanted cards after a few turns.

After a few games you have used the best cards a few times and it is less good, but that's because the cards were so good before it is difficult to surpass the original feeling.

Not a bad party game, but if you play it multiple times and start seeing the cards again and again, it becomes quite stale. It's less about playing clever cards that match the black card and more about playing what you think the person will find the funniest, even if it doesn't make sense.

Nice party game for plaing with non-gamer friends as a drinking game, or as a social game, good for a laugh. Participants need to be able to tolerate tasteless humour about religion, race, sex, etc. Its main problem is that it has zero replayability. As shocking as some cards may be, they won't be next time.

Hilarious, rollicking fun at first (as in when I first got the game) but after playing with different groups, it got "meh" very fast, since the novelty disappears when you know all the cards. Also, how much fun it is depends highly on the group you're playing with; it simply clicks with some crowds and not with others. It's an interesting party lubricant at best. I would much rather play its hipster granddaddy, The Metagame.

When I played this game for the first (and only) time, I had high expectations, as I love politically incorrect games.

But this game is no fun, and that's not because of the jokes themselves, but because it's not so easy to pull good jokes from the deck. People usually have cards which doesn't fit for a good joke with the given question.

Plus, when I played, the others haven't specified a game end, so the bad game simply dragged for a loooong time after its fun faded (about 5 minutes after it began).

This is a bad game. Stay away from it.

Besides being a rip off of a mediocre party game, it's a 10-second joke but on repeat for over an hour.  Of course, rich "progressive" children get a kick out of it because they express their internal racism and sexism in a form of a card game without the social isolation backlash, hence the popularity and higher than 6+ ratings.  Doesn't help the creator of the game, Max Temkin, was accused of sexual assault and he tried to see if he can sue the victim.  I guess the community is trying very hard to be "inclusive"

RATING: 4
"Assholes to Assholes" is a very apt description, but CAH improves on AtA's formula in a lot of ways. The Mad Libs-style cards are much more interesting, with two-element cards, haiku, and more to chew on. It produces a lot of laughter, often at things that are sick and wrong.

It does share my least favorite aspect of AtA, though: Having a bad hand the entire game and never getting any decent cards. I also wish there were more over-the-top offensive cards and fewer oddball normal cards -- more "Jerking off into a pool of children's tears," less "Batman."

Still: This is a lot of fun, eclipses AtA in every way, and makes for a great quick party game. I've never played it and NOT had fun.

---

I don't remember what rating this started at, but my guess is an 8 or a 9. I re-rated it to a 6 at some point, and now it's down to a 4. Most of the fun comes from "Haha, we're so inappropriate," but my hand of boring cards and the lack of actual game mechanics eclipse that pretty quickly.

Not my type of humour, but I still laughed (it definitely helps if you're in a group you're comfortable with). It's not really a game, but I treated it as an exercise in "what will make the CHOOSER laugh?" and I "won", so if you hate CAH, perhaps think of it in that way and you'll wring some enjoyment out of it.

Worst game ever. Extremely vulgar with highly objectionable content. The only point of the game is to get people to say things they wouldn't say in polite company. How is that fun?

I lumped the base game and the majority of the expansions together when rating them, considering them all one game. The exceptions are noted.

Overall this game always seems to be a hit. Very fun, very crazy. I can see that if you were to play it way too much then it would lose a lot of it's appeal pretty fast, but I have yet to run in to that problem. I always rate on how much fun the game is and how often people want to play it, so this is a huge hit.

Cards Against Humanity is a card game that takes the Apples to Apples system and puts a perverse, misogynistic, racist, anti-religious theme on it.

On your turn you read a card from one deck.  The word on the card is usually some kind of adjective.  Then everyone else looks at their cards (taken from another deck) which are usually nouns, and hands one face down to the current player.  The player whose turn it is takes all the other players cards, shuffles them, reads them out to the group, then chooses the noun he thinks goes best with the adjective.  Whomever's card the person picked gets the adjective card.  Whoever has the most of these at the end of the game wins.

Cards Against Humanity's strength and weakness are the same thing, which is its ability to shock players with depraved word combinations.  It's a strength in the first couple plays, but with each new game the shock value decreases drastically.  However, even from the first play one quickly feels like they are being bludgeoned over the head with over-obvious teenage toilet humour.  It's ok once in a very long while, but that's it.  I would not recommend this game, at all though, if you are easily offended.  As the game produces a no-holds-barred attack against every group and institution.

Cards Against Humanity is the Adult Swim (late night cable program) equivalent to the board game hobby. Its trash, stupid, shocking, funny (at times), cheap, and only surviving by a dedicated fan base.

RATING: 4
Not elitist rating. When I first played it my rating would've been something like 9. But every game since has been bit worse than one before. Sometimes a new combo elevates it. Usually not. Expansions aren't enough. It's a fun game to try, but not that replayable. And it kinda plays itself, you'll see.

Expansions:
+Cards Against Humanity: First Expansion
+Cards Against Humanity: Second Expansion
+Cards Against Humanity: Third Expansion

RATING: 5
If I'm in the right mood and with the right people this can be a laugh. You can't take it too seriously or it is sure to offend. Unfortunately as the expansions have gone on the cards seem to have become much more immature. As if the company is trying too hard to shock or offend. Stick to the base game for a funny diversion that you won't play nearly as much as you think you might.

As a game, this has many obvious flaws (poor replayability, not much room for creativity, with bare minimum decision making). 

But when you need a break from any kind of strategic thinking, when played with the right group, this game is a blast with tons of laughs guaranteed. No other game has ever come close to make me laugh as hard as this one did.

Unfortunately, being familiar with the cards make this type of game a little less fun after every session.

Why the high ratings?  This is a horrible game.  I have no problem with the subject matter, but rather the foolish game itself.  It is like "pre-packaged" wit for those who have none.  It requires no thought and it does not require any choices.  It is a mad-lib with prepackaged answers, many of which simply do not fit the "blank".  Avoid.  And, for God's sake, don't pay $150 for this thing on e-bay.  What the hell.

RATING: 1
This "game" is terminally stupid. Actually, calling it stupid is an insult to the word "stupid". It's Apples to Apples with a potty mouth. 

Participants vie to finish off phrases with something clever.  Sadly, the finishing thoughts are all provided by the "game" (participants simply pick one of ten cards in their hands) ad then someone judges the best response. There is nothing creative or interesting to be seen here. 

You will feel dumber for having participated in this juvenile waste of time.

RATING: 1
This blatant rip-off of Apples to Apples is devoid of any socially redeeming value. It's only a small (and I mean minimally small) step above kiddie porn or snuff films.

If I could have rated it a -10, I would have, but the rating system doesn't allow anything below 1.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I wouldn't call Cards Against Humanity much of a game, but I guess that makes it fun for casual/non-gamer settings. 

The main draw of the game is the distasteful humor that comes from using cards to fill in the blanks on a sentence. I, personally, don't care for the humor or the scoring as its easily gamed.   

This one is still popular with friends and family, so I still get forced into playing.

I had nearly put in an order for this game a few months back, then watched a video review, then decided against it.  Then I finally got to play this last month? this month?  and the first game was hilarious!  Everyone put in really funny cards, but somehow the cards I chose that I thought would fit the sentences, everyone thought was Rando hehe.  Some of the jokes I didn't get bc I come from Oz hehe, or bc I've been living in a bubble in Japan so long that I'm not up to date with current events.  Loved the first game and really wanted to play it again.  Was about to buy it also!!!!  Actually requested it hehe.

When the opportunity came around to play it again, I was mega excited.  Then I got dealt a hand with "gahhh!!" cards that there was no way I could read aloud.  Plus some of the religiously offensive cards came up that I hadn't expected since we didn't see them in the first game.  But being a Catholic I was a bit uncomfortable about the cards about our Saviour, and some of the racist cards.  

I'd still like to play it again only with the right people (which we had), but I think that I won't be buying and adding this into my collection.  I think I'm a little too conservative? naive? something or rather, to own this game.

Replayability issues aside, this game was easily worth the price.  Sure, it's an apples to apple clone.  Sure, things are always a little more exciting when the answers are risque.  But the three hours you play the first time are worth every penny.  Great time.

Edit: Falls flat the second time you play with the same people.

Edit: If you add new people, everything is fine.  Even 30% new people.  It's great to watch the new reactions and combinations.

With more serious or "mature" people it will cause just awkwardness. I just love it!

Game in a Nutshell: X-rated Apples to Apples.

Play as: 5 player

Pros: There's some laughs in there for those with a dark sense of humor and are not easily offended. It actually looks like they put effort into the cards moreso than a game this derivitive usually has.

Cons: Not really a game so much as a method for creating really horrible things to say. Probably not safe for most occassions.

Other: This isn't a game you need to be on the fence over. Either you should just love the concept or stay clear of it altogether.

Best Use: An outlet for that part of you that kind of wants to see if a pedophilia can effectively be funny or not.

RATING: 5
I will gladly admit this is a stupid party game, but it can be fun with the right people. It just depends on how willing people are to put aside their proper personal opinions and just go with the flow. It's mainly about creating absurd and/or horrible scenarios by matching white phrase cards to black challenge cards. Whichever combination the judge thinks is the best, whether it's the funniest, the most 'out there' or something else. Good for the occasional play, but if you play it too much you will tire of it.

Much better than Apples To Apples, only because the combinations are provocative and have more potential to be funny.  Will offend the easily offended.  But like AtA, it is mostly about what cards you happen to draw.  Good for boring people looking for something to make them engage each other.  I'd rather play a game.  Could be a lot of fun (in small doses) with a very specific set of people.

Very simple gameplay means it is easy for new players to pick up.  Players cannot be easily offended and so picking the right group to play this with is key.  Yet to figure out what the replay value is, but with so many cards and expansions, expect this to be pretty good.  They did a good job with the Australian localisation.

RATING: 2
I'm told that this is like Apples to Apples...but with penis jokes and such. Which means nothing to me because I've never played Apples to Apples. I have played Cards Against Humanity, late at night, with a bunch of people who were at least one of the following: drunk, sleepy, confused or depressed. I was at least two of those (and I wasn't drunk), and it was an experience I shall not soon forget. Sadly, neither will anyone else on the same floor of the hotel, as a manager was none too pleased to inform us. Apparently, we (meaning everybody else, as I was trying to withdraw inside my own skull and ride it out) were not merely being too noisy--that would have been underachieving--but too noisy shouting things like "up the butt!" for reasons that I'm sure made sense at the time.

Don't pay any attention to people who say this is offensive. They have made the cardinal error of taking this game seriously. The proper amount of seriousness taking here should be slightly less than one nanomolecule (or whatever sciencey measuringey thing you use to weigh such trifles).

The game could be dumber, I suppose, and certainly more painful. I shudder to think exactly [i]how[/i]. Possibly it would involve the sudden, vomitous birthing of a tentacled monstrosity that, unbeknownst to you, had been incubating under your eyelid and was just waiting for an opportune moment to introduce itself. Whether this would make the game seem better in comparison I couldn't say, but some part of me fears it wouldn't. Mind you, I'm not volunteering to conduct the test. I've already [i]played [/i]Cards Against Humanity and therefore I feel I've suffered enough and am entitled to reasonable compensation, such as a half hour of naked cuddle time with a supermodel.

The true brilliance of this game is that it lives up to its name. I felt just a little less like a human being after playing it. So there's that.

Think Apples-to-Apples, but for adults with darker humor. Players take turn flipping a black question/fill-in-the-blank card, and the other players choose a white noun/phrase card that they think best fits the black card. The player who flipped the black card chooses the white card that they like the best, and gives the black card to the player who played that white card. Random example: Black-"What's that sound?", White-"A mime having a stroke".

I. Love. It.

It takes what each and every Apples-to-Apples game eventually degenerates into (chosing the , and makes it the focus of this game. My roommates and I have played it so much in a short period of time.

It was a kickstarter success story, and it's typically sold on Amazon for about $25. Unfortunately, it's usually sold out (along with the expansion). However, the makers of the game will allow you to go to their website and just print out a copy of the base game (which is what I ended up doing).

I've listed it on my owned list and wishlist, as if I were to get the expansion, I'd probably want the non-DIY version with it.

This is not a game, it is an activity. A very entertaining activity, if you are in the right mindset and with like-minded people. This would be dreadful with the wrong people or with people of varied backgrounds (or senses of humor). 

Crude jokes, off-taste humor, left-wing political opinions, superhero references, drug references, sexual innuendo and then some, and some cards that are just flat-out in bad taste. 

It's worse than what it's frequently called, "R-rated Apples to Apples", because there's so much room for offense in the cards.

Always amusing.  I do feel like I have to selectively curate out some cards if we expect to play with certain people just so I don't offend them.  Somewhat ironic.  As of 11/22/2016 I'm just logging this instead of doing all of the expansions, it's just tedious.

RATING: 9
If this is a game for horrible people, I must be a horrible person, because it cracks me up every time. This game takes little time to explain and is great for parties. Keep in mind that the cards contain really awful stuff, but that's the point. I have found that after a few dozen games that it did get a bit repetitive. Adding new expansion packs every once in a while has kept it fresh.

Because of the subject matter, this deserves all the vilification it gets. If there was a -0 result, it would deserve it. Games like this debase and shames our great hobby and make a mockery of what we say is great about our hobby. the designers are no friends to our hobby nor are anyone who buys or plays it.

Ultimately, this is a game designed by cowards for cowards to play so they can say things and laugh at things that people with any kind of values know are repugnant and vile because it's "just a game".

The first time you play Cards Against Humanity is likely the best time you played Cards Against Humanity.

I LOVE the humor. Every card feels like it was specifically engineered to get you to giggle. The people behind this game have a great sense of humor, even outside of the game. That being said... If your friends aren't funny, nothing will change that. Your unfunny friends might enjoy this game and think this makes them funny. It does not. The game loses its edge fast and hard and largely depends on the group you play with.

As long as you go into this knowing what to expect, I guess it's not so bad: lots of potty humor, opportunities to toss around un-PC phrases, and so on...and I'm one of the "easily offended" people who takes issue with Archipelago and saying "niggardly."

My real issues are with the game mechanisms. Here again we have a Munchkin-like experience where you could glean most of the enjoyment of the game through just reading the cards. The game itself is simply an exercise in doing so. Unlike Apples to Apples, there are some cards that are clearly more ridiculous than others, and these will automatically win over a cleverly played pairing. To make this a better game, they could have taken out these cards, but clearly the design principles here were based the designers giggling and snorting "Oh my God, you [i]have[/i] to put that card in there!" rather than playtesting, restraint, balance, etc. As such, I can see this rating dropping a point with each subsequent play.

This game was described to me as ‘like Apples to Apples, but disgusting; you’ll love it. And it was and I did. Not one that I’d want to play every day, but it was an amusing way to end an evening of gaming. Some of the cards are use US cultural references or parlance we were not familiar with, but apart from that it all played very well. 

In the right company this is a great filler/wind down game but probably not so much with the more ‘straighty one eighty’ set. One to consider purchasing as most of my friends would probably enjoy this, even the non gamers.

RATING: 3
This game appeals to the "I'm going to hell for this" type of humor enthusiast.  The basic idea is that the inherent cleverness of the joke is largely supplemented by the listener or viewer viewing the joke as inappropriate in other peoples eyes.  This works sort of similar to an inside joke, in which a lot of the enjoyment stems on the knowledge that not everyone will enjoy it.  The card combinations are all designed to set up something to be viewed as uncouth.    

"The US department of.....clitoris"
"Harry Potter and the chamber of...dead parents"

And such.  The idea to combine a silly idea with the image of other people being annoyed that you found humor in it.  

It fails in my opinion because EVERY damn card is specifically designed for the players to imagine it offending someone else.  It is 'shock' humor, just over and over and over.  If you are capable of pattern recognition, by the third turn you will start to get bored with dead babies and bestiality.  

In Apples to Apples, this sort of humor was possible, but just unlikely.  And I think if it comes out unexpectedly, something like this could be funny.  But when every card is geared toward making middle schoolers giggle, then it gets old fast.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
+2 genuinely funny in a way that's more than the sum of it's parts. 
+1 good social game that gets people talking and bonding. 


-1 although it has more lasting power than most 'funny' games, the replayability is still limited, and enjoyment can decay pretty drastically thereafter
-.5 crude humor can go down badly, risky game in mixed company. 

Ubiquitous party game and ice-breaker.

RATING: 7
I don't love it when this is suggested, because it isn't so much a game as just hanging out and being clever, but when it does get out with the right group, it is as fun as any other game.   Often when people get weighed down with deep strategy and complicated rules you just want to get drunk and be offensive.  The only real strategy is when to dump a card that you know will never win and sacrifice the turn.

RATING: 4
By definition this is a terrible game, but its sheer popularity alone shows that it must have [i]something[/i] that people seem to enjoy!

My main issue with CAH is that there's only a pseudo strategy for winning at best, and it is hardly a game at all in this regard. The key is to immediately order your hand from most to least shocking/offensive and then simply play best cards first regardless of context. This seems to usually get you a win pending other peoples' cards.

You can have a laugh over the random outcomes of pairing one card with another for a while, but I find it gets boring very quickly (even with a ton of the several dozen expansions that are now available).

'Yeah but its not about winning, its about making people laugh, but watch out- it could offend people!' The kind of people I hang around with crack way funnier and way harsher jokes then these cards every day. Seriously who gets offended by this 2nd rate South Park humour?

I'll never own it, and I'd never ask to play it, but I'm just willing to sit through it once in a while. In game terms its still a dog turd.

-Extreme simplicity
-No pressure for playing badly, you're only in the spotlight if you've won a round
-Some very funny words and sentences
-Somewhat known

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Dangerous to hurt or offend someone (hasn't happened yet)
-Would not feel comfortable playing with everyone
-Would (probably) get repetitive fast

I never had a bad time playing it or someone who got offended, but I could definitely see it happen. Although I had some really great times with it, it is not something I would want in my collection; it would give people the wrong impression about the hobby and me.

While I could see this getting boring fast after multiple playthroughs (yes I get it now, "a big black dick" is funny with everything), since I almost never play it, the words still surprise me and as a result it hasn't been boring yet.

Monikers is the better game.

4-30 players?  (I wouldn't want to play with more than 8, certainly.)  This is a "raunchier" version of Apples to Apples.  It's irreverent and hilarious, but I think some of the cards take the humour too far.  I played an 8 player game which took too long, so I would want to change the victory conditions for a large group in the future. Now that I own it, I have taken sandpaper to all the oppression-perpetuating cards (and some that just weren't funny) and written new things on them. It is much more fun this way, and I can play for more than an hour. Received the Jewish expansion for free; many of those cards had sandpaper taken to them. :P
My rating (7.5) is for my version. The regular one I might rate a 6.5.

The problem is that the jokes are the cards, so people who don't like hearing the same jokes over and over again will have a poor time playing this game more than a couple times. On the upside, it can be played when well inebriated, and it is fun/ny when you play it for the first or second time, or when you play with a new group. I don't really have a desire to play again, but I will accommodate others that do.

I hate Apples to Apples, mostly because I feel like there is no way to catch up if you fall behind.  In Cards Against Humanity this never feels like a problem, because so many of your card choices are awful and hilarious, and when you lose it's usually because someone else played something even funnier.  Fun game if you've got the right group for it.

EDIT: Big problem with this game - playing it too much, or letting a session go for too long.  If people stop giggling at the cards, it's time to play the haiku card and move on!  Fell way down in my rankings due to overplaying, and I'm not really sure I ever need to play it again.  It had its time in the sun for my group, and we've since moved on to things like Funemployed.

My opinion on this game pretty much mirrors the sentiment seen in Shut Up & Sit Down's review. 
All in all, I don't like it. I have had fun experiences with the game, but no thanks to the game. If I wanted a similar style of game, but with more to it as a game, along with a less crass tone, I'd play Snake Oil - which is a marvelous game!
I can think of no situation in which I would want to play Cards Against Humanity again. I've seen what it has to offer, and I've been left unimpressed - both with it's crass, edgy tone and with it's monotonous gameplay - and as a result of that, Cards Against Humanity is one of only three or four games that I've actively decided to remove from my library..!

Balderdash for Dummies. In theory, the game works well, but the whole thing seems to eschew any strategy or 'clever-jokes' for 'whoever draws the rudest card wins'. It's kind of arbitrary. As a drunken laugh, it's actually quite good the first few times. As a game, it really falls flat. Imagine Balderdash if all the answers were pre-generated, rude, and you just pick them from a list. Extra points as some of the jokes can actually be very funny (for those with that kind of sense of humour like me), but the game itself is flawed.

D'accord, j'accorde une note sévère. Mais un (SEXE ORAL NON RÉCIPROQUE!!) jeu qui exige une dose d'alcool dans le sang n'est pas un jeu auquel je peux accorder une haute note.

Et ça continue ainsi: UN PRÉPUCE!!, DES BÉBÉS MORTS!!, UNE FELLATION AU VOLANT!!...

This game is quite simply Apples to Apples for people with a little more twisted humor. It isn't really groundbreaking in that sense, but it also doesn't lie about what it is. If you have the right kind of humor, you'll love this game. Tons of people give this game much lower scores and I've looked for a reason to dock points off this game. When it comes down to it, this game is a laugh riot and that's what really matters. It's always a good time playing Cards Against Humanity. It occasionally seems like we might have found all of the best combinations in the game, but then inevitably we get surprised with one of the funniest things we've ever heard. Plus with a good flow of expansions from Cards Against Humanity themselves and Crabs Adjust Humidity, the game can continue to be fresh.

If Apples to Apples were a movie, it would have a rating of "parental guidance". Well, Cards Against Humanity is the "restricted" version. The cards denote racial, religious and sexual things. But it is an incredibly funny game. 

The slight differences from Apples to Apples is that you have 10 cards to choose from, and sometimes you have to play 2 cards at once. 

It's a fun filler.

For me personally the game was only truly funny the first 6-8 times. Adding the expansions adds the funny back into the game for a while, but just speaking bout the base game for now, only a few of the cards retain there slap stick comedy throughout the game play.

A fun and silly game, not for everyone due to the humour, but it can be a lot of fun if the crowd you're playing with is up for it. It can even be played as a 2-player game, with a third imaginary player being operated by the current Card Czar totally at random. You'd be surprised at just how funny random answers can be.

The game does not scale as well as it claims. Anything above 8 players gets mind-numbing; hearing 2 or 4 or 8 potential punchlines to the same joke setup is one thing, but having to wade through 10 or more ceases to be funny. I recommend playing as teams when you have a crowd of more than 8 people.

A rude little game that you have to be very open-minded and not easily offended to play.  1st play had everyone in stitches.  Second play we had surprisingly cycled through many of the cards already and the joke started to wear off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Got tired of the jokes after a while, and it seems to go for toilet/shock humor so it got old kind of fast. Its a little too random for my taste too, even though I found it funny. I find there is some strategy in guessing the psychology of the picker and choosing something they'd probably like, but I still am just generally not crazy about party games, especially ones like this that get old a bit quick.

Plays: 5+
One thing I have noticed thoug is that I get better the longer a game goes for since I learn peoples mentalities, and i ironically have a pretty high win rate for this, despite hating or disliking it so much.

I think I rated this game so low because of its overwhelming popularity with the general population. That, and the only people that want to play this game will vote for the most offensive card besides the most appropriate card, and that's idiotic.

That's a problem with the players, not the game.

But the game still sucks, so it can stay at the 3 rating and will never go higher.

This game is interesting because those who give it a 10 and say that it is hilarious have just as much of a point as those who rate it a 1 and say that it is puerile and vulgar with no thinking potential.

I played someone else's copy with my game group and found it ridiculously funny. I mean, people are forced to laugh despite themselves and despite being completely tidy minded in every other aspect. As a filler, I have to say that I enjoyed it. But don't tell anyone.

Obwohl ich mittlerweile keine Lust mehr auf Cards Against Humanity habe, sind mir die Erinnerungen an die ersten Partien voller Lacher durchaus noch viel wert.
Gerade für Leute, denen Brettspiele eher fremd sind oder solche, die ungerne auf Druck kreativ sein möchten, kann CAH Abende voller Lach-Bauchkrämpfe bescheren.

Nur ist der Witz irgendwann erzählt und das übrig bleibende Spiel bietet weder Platz für Eigeninitiative noch Cleverness. Wie ein altes Witzebuch, bei dem man eine magere Pointe nach der nächsten vorliest.

[u]Gute Alternativ-Spiele:[/u]
• [b][thing=8829]Nobody Is Perfect[/thing][/b]
Behält das Frage-und-Antwort-Schema von CAH bei, bietet jedoch die Möglichkeit, mit Halb- oder Unwissen den Mitspielern urkomische vermeintliche Begriffsdefinitionen als wahr zu verkaufen.
• [b][thing=158564]Billionaire Banshee[/thing][/b]
Hier ist wie bei CAH zwar auch keine Kreativität gefragt, dafür bieten die lustigen, fiktiven Lebensabschnittsgefährten viele Gelegenheiten, um in Gespräche über ideale Partner abzutauchen und dadurch oft Möglichkeiten, seine Mitspieler in "Beziehungssachen" näher kennenzulernen.
• [b][thing=46213]Stille Post Extrem[/thing][/b]
Auch hier ist keine eigene Kreativität vonnöten - dafür wird gezeichnet. Und je weniger man dies kann, desto lustiger wird die Runde häufig.
• [b][thing=178570]Die Unüblichen Verdächtigen[/thing][/b]
Wenn die politisch inkorrekten Witze der reizende Faktor bei CAH waren, könnte DUV gut passen. Hier tanzt man mutig auf einer Schlängellinie zwischen Vorurteilen, Humor, Rassismus, Menschenkenntnis und Selbstreflektion.

Requires alcohol for rating of 7 (not a bad thing).  The card quality of this edition is terrible, there are bubbles in the card that sometimes break and disfigure the cards.  Also, many of the cards look dirty like they have been smeared with charcoal out of the box.  All the expansions I've gotten have much better card quality and are of a sturdier material.  It looks like the new core sets are better printed as well.

RATING: 5
There's a great controversy about this game. Some people feel offended by it and some others think it's ultra-mega-fun. I'm in the middle. I'm not easily offended and certainly not by this game, but there are some things that even if they don't offend me, they doesn't seem funny to me.

In fact, the main idea about finding word combinations is great and it is supposed to provide loads of fun. But then I don't find the execution that funny. People tend to give points to the most outrageous and sexual fill-in cards, no matter if they don't make sense at all with the main card. And that's the part I don't like. You are supposed to make funny combinations. I can see myself laughing at a joke about dead babies, but it needs to be funny. A random sentence about dead babies won't make me laugh.

You could say that the game is not to blame about it, that it is the behavior of the players. But that's not totally true either. The game includes deliberately provocative cards that promote this behavior. 

So, overall, for me it's a story of what could have been.

A couple of additional random thoughts:
-> I guess it has a low replay value, especially if it's played this way. The jokes will quickly become old. Fortunately, you have plenty of expansions for that.
-> It's dangerous to play it with strangers. It will improve when played with people you feel comfortable with.

Hilariously funny for those who will not be offended.  However, let's be honest, there is no game here - some cards will always be picked over other cards regardless of the cluegiver's card.

I suspect that once the deck has been gone through once the game will instantly be less hilarious.   But for a one-time playing, I cannot imagine laughing any more without risking injury.

To be clear here, I don't actually have a problem with the "theme" which seems to be mostly the problem for a lot of people that don't like this. 

I simply don't get the appeal of it. The game is all about giving "funny" answers, but giving funny answers to me is not funny at all when it's the game that is already giving them itself. You simply pick one from a limited choice and that's it. There is no creativity, no insider jokes, just picking one you happen to have. 

To me Say Anything (which for me eventually is also just an "ok" party game) does exactly the same thing when you play it with fun people, but as the answers are not just read from cards but actually made up, it can be actually funny.

Must have played a million times in college. Other commenters are right — it's kind of a drinking, party game, super easy. Also in agreement with other commenters, once you've seen all the cards so you know all the jokes it gets a little less funny. Relies entirely on you having the same sick sense of humor as another player, or someone playing something so unrelated it ends up being oddly humorous (after a few shots, usually). Overall okay.

This is a fun game, with the right group of people and the right amount of alcohol. I do worry about the replayability somewhat.

But there are cards in here that I think go too far.

An excellent party game for the right crowd. And I mean you really need to know if your friends/family are ready for a game like this. This game is dirty! The game box says this game is for horrible people. It is not for the easily offended or even the somewhat offended. It is likely that everyone will be offended by some card or other in this game. This also is not a game to play with students. For all you teachers out there that like to provide a game day for your students...do not try this one. Also, don't let your students convince you that you need to play this game with them.

Now after that big disclaimer, it is without a doubt well play tested and hilarious party game. This is essentially Apples to Apples in it's rules, but with some differences I mention below. It amazes me as to how many diverse answers to the questions fit so well and in so many unusual/funny ways. If you want to just play with 2 players and a dummy player it is fun and works. This is unique to this party game, because most are absolutely unplayable with 2 people. 

The dummy player is essential to any game, because you will want to blame a really bad card on someone else and a dummy player really is funny. Some good dummy player suggestions are (Yoda, your cat, a family or friend that isn't currently playing the game). We use a squeeze toy named Happy that laughs hysterically. 

Another awesome feature to the game is the wager you can place in any game turn. If you have won a card, you may wager that card allowing you to add a second card to the selection handed over to the judge. If you win a card that round you keep your wager and the won card. If you lose that round the wagered card goes to the winner of the round.

Before I played this game I had heard a handful of good things from friends who had played it, and a few equally negative things from people who either had previously played or refused to play this specific title. I decided to buy the game and my wife and I played around with it, playing together with a two player variation we settled on, and found the game fairly enjoyable. Then it would sit on our shelf and remain unplayed for days or even weeks at a time, best enjoyed in short bursts. Tonight however, we found the perfect other couple to introduce to the title and found the game to be a quite enjoyable dinner and drinks  party game. Not very high for replayability after a few sessions, but with the right people and a bottle of vodka? A great game with lots of laughs.

This kills off Apples to Apples for me. The change from just nouns to having all sorts of matching requirements (Blankety-Blank questions, situations, multi-answers, and so on) provides a lot more opportunity for cleverness and laughter in the answers. And the provided answer cards are more interesting to read and choose between as well. Adding a general layer of smuttiness accelerates the laughs, no matter what you think. Having a fun, easily taught game that can play quickly and take a high (and variable) number of people is an asset to a collection.

7 plays - Cards Against Humanity can be fun with the right crowd and I do like what it is trying to implement - a way of getting friends to interact in a group in a new, slightly odd, but fun way! However, I definitely take the, "it is too forced" angle, like many others. 

Jokes/ comical-ness (?) are a lot more fun, when they originate from somebody. Snake Oil and Billionaire Banshee are much better examples of the same concept as CAH, but done far, far better. I've had so much more fun with these games, because you actually reveal something about yourself, your personality and your humor in a much different, better way.

As advertised, this game is Apples to Apples for adults.  The rules are exactly the same (I'd say "ripped-off", but everything in the party genre is a rip-off to some degree), but the cards are different--they're a collection of some of the most perverse, politically-incorrect, potty-humor things you can think of.  If this sounds appealing, you'll certainly enjoy it.  If it doesn't, then you certainly won't.  If you do play it, just make sure you have the right crowd...

Better than Apples to Apples but not by much. It has the same problem I have with Apples to Apples.

1. You get stuck with shitty cards that don't work with the given card or you get cards that you don't know anything about. Aaron Burr?

2. It's funny for a bit and this is where the only bump in ratings for me. It's a lot funnier than AtA. I could see it wearing it's welcome out quite quickly though.

3. The game seems either to never end or just end depending on who's throwing in the correct cards at the right time.

Whilst a blast on purchase, several years down the line and I've given this game away. More than 4 players slowed the game down significantly.

Also every round was reduced to most offensive card wins and/or rounds of rubbish answers where all players were just discarding cards from their hands which was about 50% of the time.

Whilat constant expansion purchases would have negated some of the issues perhaps I just didn't want to keep buying new decks. 

For a similar and somewhat more rewarding experience try Cyanide & Happiness' comic strip game. Or just play codenames. Not (as) offensive but very fun with large groups and massive replay value right out of the box.

This game combines two of my personal favorite things: 1. Being creative 2. Being humorous. My friends told me that this game was "created for people like me." The only two things I don't like about it are: 1. Some of the cards just feel like they shouldn't be in there. Some of the proper nouns especially, where no one at the table knows who the person or thing is, and the joke is lost. It's always frustrating. And 2. You really need at least 6 players for this to be any fun, which can be a challenge at times. My favorite games tend to be ones that are most fun with 3-4 players. HOWEVER, as long as no one at the table is easily offended, this is a great game where everyone will most likely be laughing while you play and that is always fun.

Very similar to Apples 2 Apples, however with an adult/vulgar theme.  Like A2A, it's a funny social game with a lot of laughter.  Like A2A, unfortunately, the judge will pick the "best" answer which may not be the best answer and suffers at their whims (even when playing to the judge).

Like most party games, not much of a game, however more of a social entertaining way to pass time.

Update: let me be a little clearer. This game is for people who love raunchy non-sequiturs. I imagine fans of the Family Guy cartoon are the people buying this game. Suddenly Hitler with gonorrhea! Squirrels stapled to your nuts! Upper deckers!

Great party game. It tests how well you know how your friends will react to shit. The implication of this is that to do better at the game, you have to know how to pander to your friends better, but do so without being too obvious about your pandering. The meta-strategies are actually pretty interesting.

It is a rare case when one can observe a game in passing and know exactly how it plays. This was the case with CaH. I'd seen it played at cons and hearing just a few of the punchlines, I pretty much knew how I felt about it. My one play confirmed it. It was great for a few laughs as long as players are comfortable saying terrible things around one another. The owner of the game couldn't (or wouldn't) tell me how long it was supposed to last ("we usually play until we've gone through all the cards"), but I was ready to be done well before that happened. I think 2 or 3 times aronud the table would be appropriate. This will get stale after hearing the jokes a few times, so I'm glad to play once in a while, but not own Cards Against Humanity.

A great party game, for the first few plays. Expansions can't save it. At this point it's so ubiquitous that I think we can say this one's over with. It's most fun if you can surprise a group of people who've never seen it. It's actually rather annoying playing with people who are big fans of the game, because they usually act like they've got some monopoly over the funny, and it's just bleh.

And yet the game remains a classic.

Great game. A dirty version of Apples to Apples. Much better with expansions and much, much better if played while intoxicated. It's just one of those games that loses something when played stone cold sober - but just my opinion! It's a good party hit and especially fun if you can find someone who's never played it before. I have burned a few cards that were a bit too disgusting, but for the most part it gets some great laughs.

Just one play but unsure about this one. It is dependent on a homogenous group with a lot of common references and humor (and possibly boosted by a crate of beer). Along with the subjective scoring, this feels a lot more like an activity.

Given the above, I think I'd skip the game and just have the friends and beer.

Sold having not played my copy. Other friends have it and I haven't enjoyed a single game. I don’t mind the crudity at all but hate the mechanic of someone else determining what is funny from a selection of ZERO creative input options.
Did not feel engaged with the game.  Laughed at some card combinations on the first play through – not funny on the second.
Will only ever play under peer pressure at a party.
Sad that it is a requirement of the game to be drunk to enjoy it

Apples to Apples for people with a taste for crude humor.
I'm not a fan of the game. It has limited replay-ability, promotes the worst thought patterns (...against humanity.. it's right there), and all around is unsatisfying after the 2nd or 3rd play. 
I suggest a game like Say Anything, or (loosely) Telestrations, if you're interested in a wider range of thinking in Apples to Apples style games.

The best game to play at a party, especially if people are drinking.  Don't get it for your serious game group because it is not a serious game.

I've probably played it a dozen times and had just as much fun the twelfth time as the first though I often play with people who have expansions.

This is a word association game that's essentially an Apples to Apples clone only here the cards are focused on being strange, dirty or offensive. The early plays of this game were hilarious for the shock value effect. As the game got played more times, and the shock value wore off, we started using the cards to more and more creative effect. I still enjoy the game in theory, although I've shyed away from short filler games lately in general. I'd still play this over Apples to Apples, because I feel there are fewer cards that wind up as duds, although in the case of both games, as you mix in expansions, it pays to go back and remove some of the cards that don't work well with your group.

You know what you are getting with this game. With the right group of people, it's a mindless and raucous time.

RATING: N/A
I personally prefer Apples to Apples. If you think the idea of Billy Mays advocating for Kids with ass cancer is hilarious then you will probably prefer this one.

UPDATE: After more plays, this is really hit-or-miss based on the group. I've played with some groups who use the cards to make intelligent social commentary. I've played with some groups who automatically give the round to whoever makes the most vulgar combination. When the above two groups play together, things get strained.

Tentative rating: 7/10. It's really hard for me to rate this game because it's so context-dependent. I'm probably biased because my best friend loves this game and I always have a great time playing it with him, even though I do not love it.

This is probably the greatest find I've ever come across. I've had it for around three years and it gets played at 99% of my get-togethers and parties. Almost all of my friends have bought it and I have given it as wedding gifts. I have all the expansions and have even had my own personal collection professionally printed. I may be a dork for doing this, but having cards that say inappropriate things about my friends makes the game even better. I have only come across one person who did not like this game, but she didn't like ANYTHING so I wouldn't even worry about her. My mom, my grandma, my grandma's friends: EVERYONE loves this game.

If you're reading this, I highly doubt you Geekbuddied me for my opinion on this game.

It's a thing people do when they get together.

A party game that offers nothing original and finds its humour through making people be as offensive as possible. The game offers nothing to encourage creativity or originality and should only appeal to teenage boys. I am not offended by the cards simply by the lack of any real game on display here.

Good for some laughs occasionally. I really dislike the "dud" and "shocker" cards; having Pac-man guzzle down some man gravy is really only funny the first time you see the card.

On the bright side, the cards are great for making other games hilarious, such as Telestrations.

Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over" see how that is annoying? ooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmaoooohoahaohoh, that is soooooooooo baaaaaaaad. xD xD xDlmao

Its crude, and the problem with that is that most people just throw in the grossest card they think is funny instead of trying to make combinations which leads to much smarter humour.

While this doesn't fit into my usual type of game I play, this is a good party game where you will see people get a lot of laughs.  Game play can be learned within the first turn.  Only problem is that replay-ability goes down with every play because you start to remember the cards after a while and it's not as surprising.

CAH doesn't always work the way it's supposed to, sometimes there isn't anything especially funny on the table and sometimes you don't even have answers that make sense enough to even be funny. But when this game works, it's the most hilarious game I've ever played. Also of note, this is totally inappropriate for kids or non-crude family members/friends.

If Apples to Apples were a G or PG game, Cards Against Humanity is R or NC-17. Fun party game, but it wears out its welcome if played too much. Requires being mindful of the group as it can make some uncomfortable and the examples on the back of the box are rather mild. It pretty much gets played only for holidays like New Year's.

I burnt myself out on Apples to Apples long ago. I thought maybe CAH could breathe new life into the formula, but it turns out it's twice as trite and one hundred times less clever. To be humorous in Apples to Apples you had to be a bit clever, but here, the worst kind of humor is just force fed to you. I am not even offended by this game. I am just disappointed with the lack of creativity.

I almost consider this broken.  It clearly becomes a game with an implicit rule of "whoever is funniest wins".  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but with 1 or 2 people who are super conservative or just don't "get comedy" it's a REALLY bad experience.

This game and all like it can go straight to hell.

As we call it around our house, "Assholes to Assholes." 

I've laughed at every John Waters movie; I've read every issue of Paul Krassner's "The Realist" I could get my hands on; I think Gilbert Gottfried's take on "The Aristocrats" is hilarious; Peter Cook and Dudley Moore improvising as Derek and Clive makes me laugh like a drain. Those are all examples of vulgarity and bad taste by very creative people. This game is just vulgarity and bad taste for amateurs. It commits the cardinal sin of comedy -- almost every single joke punches DOWN. 

Some perfectly lovely people I know just adore this game, and if it gives them a few cathartic belly laughs, I see a reason for it to exist. I don't hold the fans of this game in contempt, but anybody who gives up after a hand or two gets an extra serving of my respect.

The base set still has some of the best cards in the game (as well as some of the most deserving of a culling), but after way too many plays the game has worn thin.  I have never been a big fan of the "judge" mechanic, and that feeling has only grown stronger with additional plays.

Though I appreciate the masses getting into games other than Monopoly, it worries me that most of my non-gaming friends think Cards Against Humanity is the best game out there. It's decent enough, but lacks replay value and relies too heavily on shock factor. But criticisms aside, it's a fun enough game that I keep around for my casual friends.

Played with first 2 expansions. A sillier, adult-themed, version of Apples to Apples.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Gratuitously offensive and hysterically funny in a large group if everyone has an exceedingly twisted sense of humour and *knows* what to expect. Wears out its welcome quite quickly because choosing the most offensive card appears to be the best strategy, and repeated plays significantly reduces the shock value.

Say Anything would be a better choice because you can still be non-Pc, if you so choose, and it will not become as dated as CAH.

Venomously funny, whilst it lasts.

I think anyone seeing my rating for this game would figure that I would find this game offensive, which I don't. It's dirty Apples to Apples and yes, there's SLIGHTLY more to this and I recognize that, but it doesn't mean that the game doesn't fall victim to the trappings of Apples to Apples. The game just gets tiresome after a while. I stopped playing Apples to Apples because after seeing the same cards a lot, the game started to feel the same every time and got dull. I could imagine the problem being worse in this version because the cards are so unique. The winning card frequently seemed to be a card that was funny regardless of what it was paired with. How does that not get old?

RATING: 6
On the one hand, it cuts down the boring and gets down to business on what most people played "Apples to Apples" for.

On the other hand, such a direct attempt takes spontaneity away from the exercise, and accelerates the rate at which jokes run out of fun. There's still room for hilarious combos, but cleverness remains about the same.

Guess you either love it or you hate it. I..... don't really like it.

First time is funny, works especially when everyone is drinking. But if you need to be drunk to enjoy a game, it probably isn't all that good. 

The offensiveness doesn't bother me, it does entertain me even. Still doesn't make this a good game.

Won't say I'll never play it again. Gaelcon is coming up, that will involve a lot of beers and late night gaming over the 4 days..... But I'd never ever suggest to other people to play this.

29-05-2014. I played it twice. The first time, we all had enough to drink/were drunk and the game was funny. Hard, harsh, unforgivably despicable things came up, and guilty laughter could be heard a lot. The second time, about 6 months later the same happened but with less alcohol. The game was .. less interesting and a couple of similar things came up as the last time.

While I'd be hesitant to call the game a game, because it feels/seems more like an activity to me (ie. I do not keep score), it's ok ocassionally. But it's not a game that I would want to play more often (or maybe even again).

This is only good with the right group of friends.  Apples to Apples' main positive is that family members enjoy it - very low barrier to entry.  But this game, I can't play with my kids, so why? why?  So I can listen to my gamer friends come up with stupid jokes and laugh at how clever they were.  I take no offense from the cards - it's just super boring.

Update: Upgraded rating from 3 to 4.  Played it with a big group of good friends and it was marginally enjoyable, but it's still pretty pointless and takes forever.  A small number of the cards (maybe 10) are inherently funny and auto-win - do I need to play this for 2 hours to wait to see these cards and have a chuckle?  If you're pick for a fun evening is to play Adult Mad-Libs, then get this game. 

No, it's a 1. Makes people stupid(er).

What I would like this game to be is absurd, what it ended up being with the people I played with is a bit too obvious and literal with the connections. There are certain answers that are just more extreme than others and will be chosen almost no matter what question they are paired with. 

I liked trying to come up with very unexpected combinations of question and answer, that start to make sense if you just think a little bit about it, and then it is really funny. But those answers are rarely chosen. I guess it's because I have a Marx Brothers humor in a Three Stooges world. Apparently, my friends just think I'm pretentious.

This can be a fun party game and I like it better than the first time I played it. For me there are some cards that shouldn't be in there. The game works for me when it goes for blasphemy and doesn't try to offend for the sake of being non-PC. Maybe it would be different for different people which cards cross the line. And I would suggest everyone just taking those cards out and not playing with them.

The cards get old pretty fast, after about 4 plays you probably get through most of them and the more extreme answer cards stand out more and more. I would say either rotate through new cards or new players pretty frequently.

I don't own this game as it's always requested when I have people over who find out I like to play board games.

"Isn't CAH the best game ever?"
"I don't own it so would you like to play this game called Ticket to Ride instead?"
"How is that like CAH?"
"...The trains are carrying AIDS."

My issue is that most of the humor is from the off-color cards so after you've seen them once or twice, the game feels hollow. It's a way for people who want to be funny or risque to be that way without putting in any effort.

RATING: 4
Essentially the "dirty" version of Apples to Apples, and improves on that game, but not by much.  I actually prefer the mechanics here; I think filling in the blank works better than simply associating adjectives and nouns, and they even spice up the formula with things like double blanks and haiku.  

The more risque approach also makes this a lot funnier than Apples to Apples, but watch whom you play with; there are not only some filthy cards but some that could be disturbing or seen as pushing the line (such as the 9/11 or V-Tech Massacre cards).  

The problem with this game is the same as with Apples to Apples:  the formula gets old rather quickly, and once the shock value and novelty laughs wear off, those same outrageous cards just aren't as funny anymore.  

You need a couple expansions to keep the cards fresh, but even so, this game works best as a one-time opener with a new group.  Break the ice, get everyone laughing and loose, and then move on to other games.  If, like Apples to Apples, you play it all night or many gaming nights in a row, you WILL get sick of it.  There's only so many times you can laugh at the same poop joke, after all.

Apples to Apples clone with offensive cards. The transgressive hee-hee factor is good the first time you play it, but compared to the original, there's just no relative room for cleverness - it's all just what's printed on the card. In Apples to Apples if you came up with something offensive or dirty or witty, that was all you and a good feeling. Here's it all precanned.

Plus there's some distaste in how it gives players "permission" to be lightly racist / transphobic / etc. : https://www.dailydot.com/via/cards-against-humanity-problems/

RATING: 3
Every time I've played this game it was allowed to long overstay its welcome. The humor is forced, though that doesn't necessarily make ALL of it unfunny. When something intends to be comedic, there is a wide intended audience with varying definitions of what's comical. We can't hold it against the comedy game/book/movie/show for trying to make us laugh and entertain us, but there is definitely a reason why many comedy movies are shorter than other kinds of movies. I'd put a VERY low win condition on this game and play it as a drinking game, and that's about it.

RATING: 1
An extremely sexist and extremely insensitive game that encourages people to laugh at cases of genuine suffering. Will avoid playing if at all possible. No, I do not know every card in the deck, but I have seen enough, and do not wish to see any more.

RATING: 6
As the box will tell you, this is "a game for horrible people." It is no more than an Apples to Apples variant with very adult content. Be prepared for some pretty offensive material. It can be very entertaining; laughter for everyone! The shock value wears off pretty quickly when you are talking about multiple plays though.

I've only played this once so far but in that game, one of my friends fell off his chair four times because he was laughing so hard. I had tears streaming down my face at a couple of points, as did every other player. I don't yet know how to what extent this can be attributed to the shock factor of reading the cards for the first time, so I'll adjust my review after a few more games (which are bound to be in demand after the first one!)

RATING: 7.5
A more adult version of Apples to Apples. Very funny, especially the first time you play. After a while you start seeing the same cards, which reduces the funny unless you're playing with different people each time. Several cards are deliciously offensive, so avoid this if you have reverence for anything. Also note that while Apples to Apples you are charged with picking the card that MATCHES the best, no such rule is here. Your job here is to simply pick your FAVORITE. On the one hand this alleviates a frustration I have Apples to Apples:  irritating players who pick their favorite card instead of recognizing a good match. On the other hand, I've seen players who are trying to win Cards Against Humanity also get frustrated by the card czar skipping over your (great match) card for arbitrary personal reasons. It's best to play this just for fun. Also, I highly recommend you play with the Rando Cardrissian variant, as it encourages players not to overthink it. The variant also makes a 3 player game quite playable.

It all started off fun, but mainly with a bunch of good friends who have been drinking too much. Not too long after that, it started getting old. And older. And then, uh, uncomfortable. And then, what the hell was I thinking buying this? And several expansions? It's a game that if you stop to sober up, you realize is terrible on many levels (from casual racism to rape jokes). I'm embarrassed I ever liked this game.

Playing games keeps me young. None moreso than this one, which batters you over the head with puerile, sometimes-uncomfortable, sometimes-spontaneous hilarity. I see that it takes out the subtlety, but often in Apples to Apples, you feel hamstrung by PC-ness. This one gives you the tools to be evil, and I'm not tired of it yet.

Like Apples to Apples, better in small doses. There can be several ho-hum rounds but once in a while, there'll be something amazingly hilarious and wrong, and it'll be time to quit while ahead.

A pulpy social drinking game. If you have a mean sense of humour, then it's a great way to bond with new people and determine who you're going to have the best laugh with.

This game serves its purpose as a social/drinking/party game, but shouldn't be seen as anything beyond good quick (and sometimes crudely awesome) fun.

I bought the main game and all three expansions at the same time, so it's hard for me to assess the expansions apart from the main game.

Took a not very good game (Apples to Apples) and just made it as filthy/offensive as possible to get a charge out of people.

If you're looking for a hilarious game of political incorrectness, look no further. This is what Apples to Apples should've been. This game always creates hilarity, despite/because of just how 'wrong' it can be. I'd suggest always playing with the 'Rando Cardrissian' rules for extra laughs.

For a game which proclaims itself to be outrageous, the opportunities for humour are remarkably constrained. Jokes about bodily functions, religion and race are surefire hits in comparison to any answer containing 'a point of singularity'.

To be fair, a few combinations are genuinely funny, but otherwise the humour here is repetitive and has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Watching others play this is mildly amusing; actually playing it isn't.

The premise is simple and the game is very easy to pick up and play immediately.

I liked playing Apples to Apples a lot but I always felt it lacked by not having any raunchy cards. So naturally, when I finally got Cards Against Humanity I was really excited, but after several play-throughs I find that I almost become desensitized to it and the funny cards become less of a surprise. I also find that I am consistently holding out for cards such as "Toni Morrison's Vagina" or "AIDS" or "Menstrual Rage" as some cards are pretty much an instant win. My boyfriend and I both enjoy poking fun at the Twilight Saga, so one day we picked up a copy of Twilight the board game at savers and stole about 40 cards from that and we use those very often in cards against humanity. Depending on the group, sometimes the Twilight variant packs a harder punch than the original game itself. Overall, a great game, easy to play, and it always guaranteed a few laughs.

I really dig the concept and humor of the game - it can be really hilarious at times, but half of the cards feel like unfunny filler cards. 

Players need more than just an inappropriate sense of humor since the most laughter-inducing responses don't always win. There's a bit of skill in tailoring your responses to each player once you start getting a sense of what kind of humor they do and do not respond to. Get the right group together to play and it can be a total blast.

This is very funny. Why I only rated 6:
- a lot of players have trouble with the black humour, in the sense that they will hold back
- once a game starts, it will probably go on for the rest of the night, in spite of the suggested (and well chosen) play time of 30min
- can get shouty

This is a very good pub game, assuming you're in the sort of pub where you can say the kinds of things these cards make you say.

I play with a house rule where between rounds you may discard your entire card and draw a new one.
The whole point of the game is just to make others laugh so you are playing this game to win, you are missing the entire point of playing this to begin with.
I understand many will turn away from this game and its humor but for those with a dark sense of humor like myself, still a returning game.

Sure, it can bring the laughs, but most of the time you are waiting around wishing that you had an appropriate card, then after you make it through the deck once all the material is worn and old.

The best strategy is to draw the genocide cards, they always win.

If there was a Boardgame Channel on cable TV, where in the morning they showed Haba games, in the afternoon/evening they showed light-to-medium weight Euros and wargames and Die Macher at night, the late-night ads would have this game. There would be attractive women answering a toll-free number and you could get an expansion or two bundled in if you just ordered now, along with a copy of Monopoly. This is a raunchy Apples to Apples, much fun with the right people, but only fun if played sparingly.

Sold - UKGE 2015

Somewhat amusing for your first run through the deck, then rapidly lamer after that. This activity (#NotAGame) is completely reliant on shock humour and is thoroughly ungripping once that's gone.

I would in a heartbeat recommend Say Anything or Dixit over this game. (Albeit the former will, with some/many groups devolve into repetitive trash jut the same as CaH, but at least it gives you the option of actually being funny).

I dislike Apples to Apples. CAH is the same thing with dirty humour. Which is good for a few laughs, but there's not much subtlety to it. There's not a lot of replay value either. Certain cards are much funnier than others, and by the end you're left with a hand of boring cards. As a joke it's fun as a novelty, but it gets old quickly, and the game isn't worth playing for its own sake.

In the last month or so we have played through the entire box a couple of times at big group events...getting stale now and definitely needs an expansion soon if we are going to continue to play. 

Update: CAH continues to get less and less playtime. There are so many better party games out there that get more play time.

Components - 1/1 Card Stock is fine. Instructions are straight forward.

Fun - .7/1 Honestly my wife and I are horrible people, and we have a bunch of horrible friends. This game is hilarious in those situations. We've had our fair share of entertaining combinations, difficult decisions, and pants wetting laughter. At the same time, like Apples to Apples, with the wrong people (e.g. Decent human beings) this can easily become awkward.

Replayability - .9/1 Large number of cards and since it's all about the combinations, you can play over and over again and still get new experiences. The only reason this isn't perfect is because the best combinations tend to be the most offensive, when playing for a long while (or repeated nights) it can feel a little samey even though the cards are different.

Strategic - .5/1 A large part of the game is what is in your hand versus what card is played. There's a little playing the meta by picking a card based on the reader. Unlike Apples to Apples though, you generally have more than a single choice in your hand that could work.

Theme - .1/1 "A party game for horrible people". That's what they advertise it as, and that's what most of the cards represent. I give it a partial point for that. Otherwise there really isn't a theme.


Personal Review - 3/5 I think this is a great party game/filler. It's what Apples to Apples should have been. There's enough cards that most plays have cleaver answers and the decider actually has a choice. Generally you as a player have more than an obvious choice for the category. It works. Then again, if you get offended by things, then this definitely isn't the game for you. We tend to enjoy it because we're probably horrible people.

Though it's grown incredibly stale at this point, and I can barely stand to see it come to table... I can't deny how much my friends love it, ask to play it, and covet it.  It's a good gateway, and a party game that everyone seems to adore.  So, gotta give it its due.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is basically a vulgar Apples to Apples.  The game includes black cards that have questions or fill in the blank sentences on them and white cards that include mostly vulgar and awful responses to the black cards.  The reader each turn picks his favorite answer that the players turned in and that player gets a point.

As long as you have friends who are in this game's target audience of "horrible people" this can be great, hilarious fun.

We like to play with the Rando Cardrissian variant where we put a random answer in every turn as well.  If a random draw from the deck turns out to be funnier than everyone else at the table's answer then you should feel bad!

Even with the huge number of cards available (I even have all the expansions) this game can get kind of stale after enough plays.  There's only so many hilarious answers you can come up with before the shock value wears off and they all start to sound same-y.

What can I say? I have a sick, inappropriate, politically incorrect sense of humor. I loved playing this party game and probably will always be up for giving it a couple of rounds. Not really something to bring out on family nights (well, depends on the family I guess) I think it succeeds well at what a party game should do: accommodate a bigger group, create fun and laughs and make you get to know each other a bit on some level, here you'll learn how far some people are willing to go for a good joke. I loved it!

Update: At this point, I'm just sick of this game. Too reliant on expansions to keep it fresh. Also had a few sessions with unfunny people that put a bad taste in my mouth.

Technically, about as good of a game as Apples-to-Apples (and significantly less than the much poo-pooed Munchkin), it's still hard not to laugh. Endless combinations of sick-and-twisted humor make it a winner for everyone involved. And several plays with "Rando" variation have proven that winning is not *entirely* random.

I'm sure everyone who has played this game has good memories of it - amazing word combinations which leave everyone crying with laughter.

It's a game which introduced many non-gamers into the world of card games.

However, one issue with the game is over time it loses a bit of its spark. This is only natural as people become more familiar with the cards. There are loads of expansions though, which certainly helps keep things fresh.

Most black cards seemed to required a specific type of response, if you got the card in your hand ; you win this round that's it.  The pick 2 (or 3) cards are a nice addition though.
I'm no big fan of Apples to Apples but you can insinuate things with your answer and you can play the judge.  In CAH the most shocking cards wins every time (it's kinda the point of the game) with little input from the judge. And the shock value wears out real fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The adult Apples to Apples. You can only play "shocking response" to "innocuous card" so many times before the humor wears off. I only play this one now with people who have never played it before. They get some enjoyment out of it, but I don't even crack a smile.

More like "Apples Against Humanity".  This adult version of Apples to Apples is very cheaply produced, which would be just fine for a game of this ilk if it kept the purchasing cost to a minimum, but have you seen the prices being asked in the BGG MarketPlace?!?  But that's okay because you can craft your own copy at home; simply write any question on one piece of paper and the word "penis" on another piece of paper, and viola!, you're ready to play.  All that said, this is a very enjoyable game to play with a handful of sick-minded friends during the wee hours of the morning after copious amounts of adult beverages have been consumed.  After all, what is more funny than necrophilia?  Game design: 2/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 6/10

Take the Apples to Apples mechanic and swap out a lot of dull cards for horrific, obscene cards. The result is a greatly more entertaining game that possibly has a little less replayability but I don't hold that against it at all.

We played until we ran out of white (answer) cards which took about 3 hours and only had 2 cards that didn't elicit a great response.

Rated: print and play version and the full version

Update: It really doesn't hold up to repeated plays; even though it still raises a few laughs, it just isn't the same level of shock that you get the first time out.

Further update: This has almost no replayability for me. After just five or so plays, this is no almost no fun, even with some expansion cards mixed in.

Rating down from 7.8 to 7.2 then to 5.8, then back up to 6.

This is Cards Against Humanity, the base set, and the first three expansions. They are all mixed up, and I don't feel like taking 5 minutes to separate it out. The base box is original, but the expansions (or at least the equivalent number of cards) are in deck boxes. The regular boxes were too beat up to keep.

What everyone else says is accurate.  This is an adult Apples to Apples.  If that's your bag, then you'll have fun with it, but if not then you won't.

Over time, it does get old though, unless I suppose you keep adding more new cards and cycling old ones out.  But you'll go through them all eventually if you play it often or long enough.

Can, at times, generate real, genuine laughter, but often becomes repetitive and most players of CAH don't go for the more clever card combinations. The description "Lego for jokes" is the nail in the coffin-- lots of other games can be much funnier thanks to the efforts of the players, and in fact Lego allows for much more creative expression than this. In CAH, literally any group of experienced players I've played will at times preface their black cards with "If you play X card, you win" because the jokes are so obviously constructed. It creates shock humor that fails to be shocking, because it is so artificial. It has been a passable icebreaker with certain groups of people, but if I could replace it entirely with another game, I happily would.

WAY BETTER than Apples to Apples, but not for the faint of heart or for those who have a soul. Tends to the raunch side of games (tentacle porn is a card). Requires the right mixture of people to play, otherwise feeling and friends can be hurt. The game holds nothing sacred. Also runs into the problem that faults Apples to Apples that after several plays the funny combinations have all been seen.

I hate Apples to Apples, but I despise Cards Against Humanity.  I think it is because for years it was the "hip" "naughty" game to play, so everyone had to bring it over and insisted on playing it like it was the rebellious thing to do.  The first few times are good, the next several aren't.  Additionally it gets really embarrassing and uncomfortable for everyone when a player asks what something is.

Perhaps my biggest complaint about voting games is that often times the stupidest combinations win.  I can't tell you how many times I have played this and thrown away cards win the round.

If you want to do a matching game pick one of the others out there, but even then don't ask me to play.  I hate these voting kiss-up games.

P.S. The reason this is a 1 is because this game isn't innovative, it just copies games like apples to apples and adds NSFW elements.  Furthermore, it has no design and nothing but black and white print.  I would go sofar as to say the cards are worth nothing more than the energy contained within them for a fire.

Apples to Apples for bad people.  Tons of laughs the first time while drunk but the game gets really stale rapidly after.  It's just not a good game, but it does serve a purpose.  It exists solely for non-gamers, the unfunny and dumb people to perform an activity which mimics the trappings of a game.  Sadly it's become most peoples introduction to card and boardgames despite it's awful nature.  If you fancy yourself remotely funny or intelligent choose something like Snake Oil instead.  This is just not a good game, it gets points for entertaining morons who feel a little naughty for stringing together reprehensible things which can break the ice at a party.  It's pretty much the gaming equivalent of 13 year old boys looking up dirty words in a dictionary and it does what it does well enough.  In some ways it's depressing in it's very existence, All you need to do to be successful is steal the mechanics from another game and write poop jokes on the cards.

I give this game 10/10 because it is perfect for what it is meant to be. It's unlike all my other games; it's designed only to be a party game. And as a party game, it's the best that it can be. I've never not had a good time with this game. It always results in hysterical laughter.

Adding expansion cards after every 10-15 plays keeps it fresh, especially if you're playing with the same group of people. Best played with 5-8 players. And drink up.

Hilarious party game, but definitely requires a sense of (black) humor. If you feel some of the cards are too offensive, I would suggest The Big Bang Theory: The Party Game, which is very similar, but doesn't include nazis, dead babies or surprise sex. I admit some of the mentioned cards could be missing from our copy due to me not seeing the fun factor. So don't be put off by a few cards, just remove them and have fun with the rest.

OSHA mandates the inclusion of handrails for a game with this much edge. Completely dead for anyone who was good at being funny in their teenage years. It's not that the material is offensive; it's just that I've already thoroughly plumbed its depths and these punchlines will be in their refractory period for the foreseeable future.

CAH's veritable army of [-]fluffers[/-] [-]strap-ons[/-] expansions, first-party and otherwise, do little to assist its attempts to simulate youthful vigor. Its only redeeming quality is that it's better at teasing larger non-gaming crowds, where offering up an actual game -- one with, say, proper rules and a victory condition -- would require too much explanation and not draw enough people. It would be a better use of time to rewatch [i]The Aristocrats[/i]; this stuff isn't even amateur hour.

I'd originally ranked this more forgivingly -- "not actually a game" is a rather harsh judgment to make just based on distaste -- but in this case it's actually true! Cards Against Humanity isn't a game; it's a read-through of a script full of uninspired dirty jokes. Even the Penis Game (the one where you try to yell "PENIS!" the loudest in a public space) is better, as it 1: costs less, 2: is funnier, and 3: has winners and losers and an end condition!

It’s not that I get offended easily when it comes to playing this. It’s just that it is, to me, all about trying to get cheap laughs via vulgarity. I’ll always favour a tactical game over a party game, but if I am to play a party game, I’ll at least want it to be either 
A) challenging on a tactical level;
B) challenging on a trivial level; 
C) challenging on a dexterity level;
In theory if a party game offers one of these, it should be fun. Cards Against Humanity doesn’t. My friend Dree summarised it well when I asked him what he thought of it, “It’s not intelligent enough for you!”

It's an adults Apples to Apples. Better when drunk, for pretty obvious reasons. You have to be comfortable in yourself and in your friends in being a horrible person who is going to play things that just bring up terrible, terrible images.

But with the right group of people, this game brings lots of laughs and a ton of fun. 

I don't rate it higher than a 7 because a) there's really no end condition. You pretty much play until you're tired of playing; and b) there's a couple of house rules that need to be implemented - for example, exchanging cards - or you end up with a fist full of cards that you are just looking for opportunities to throw away.

All in all, we've played twice, and it's a pretty solid game.

Apples to Apples for adults. Let me clarify: for adults who can enjoy offensive humor in good fun. Luckily, I am one of those adults.

Update: My rating has dropped significantly after realizing that the game is only fun for a few rounds, after which it quickly becomes trite. Moreover, the humor is generated almost automatically by the game rather than the players. Apples to Apples is the superior game for people who actually want to try to be creative.

The jokes are funny at first, hilarious even, but you soon see through that to the game itself - which largely doesn't exist. There are not many hard choices actually being made, and the game somewhat plays itself, despite getting some insight into different people's humour (though the game mostly pushes it's own brand, which is over the top shock humour). This also leaves some cards pretty weak except for in very particular circumstances. But wit often isn't rewarded over simply having a funnier card.

This game is so very wrong... and that's what makes it so right. This is the version of Apples to Apples everyone wanted to play in the first place. You'll definitely find out which of your friends has the sickest sense of humor. 

CAH is a wonderful game for the first few plays, but it can very, very quickly wear out its welcome, especially if players find specific cards to always be winners. It's worth playing a couple of times, but I can't recommend buying it unless it's the perfect type of game for you and your group.

Yeah, yeah, it's derivative, it's tasteless, whatever, go f*** yourself :P  If you don't laugh like a madman playing this game, I don't want to be your friend.

Works equally well with a stack of index cards, making several of each type of card before the game and more as you go along.  Things get even funnier when you can look around the table and try to figure out who put that amazingly twisted card in the deck....

Edit (Nov. 2015): Rating dropped.  I still like this game but without expansions to keep it fresh it loses some charm.  And I resent the way that this game has a habit of taking over game nights.  But still, I'd play it.

Love the game, but we've played so much we're almost tired of it.  Best played in large groups, and a great fallback if people are too drunk to play anything else.  You can be blackout wasted and still win at Cards Against Humanity.  Still, I have to admit some of the hardest gut laughs I've EVER had with friends came from drunken nights with this game, and it's created a ton of silly inside jokes with us.  I still say the best play I've seen is "In a pinch, ____ can be a suitable substitute for _____".   The white cards played were "Puppies" and "Glory Holes".  My friends are sick, horrible people, and I love them.

Burns bright, fades fast.

Ive enjoyed hundreds of games of CAH over the years, but after the first 20 or so it became harder to enjoy without adding more expansions. I've purchased every expansion and promo they've sold directly since release, and it seems like each expansion tends to add another 5-10 fresh plays before it gets stale again.

By nature, the shock wears off, and at a certain point you've conceived every combination of horrible things you could create... That's when it gets dull.

I would definitely still recommend this for adult gaming groups, but I feel that the developers would be better served by crafting some way to tweak or modify the core gameplay in their next expansion.

Some new gameplay mechanics would go so much further than another 60 pop culture reference cards.

How this game is not rated higher, I just don't understand. This one has always been a huge success for me with multiple groups of friends and coworkers. Maybe I'm just a horrible person and know too many horrible people?

Yes, it's the same game as Apples to Apples just with a sick and twisted personality, but it's that personality that makes it so entertaining. This game is intentionally outright vulgar and (to some) offensive, but it works hard to do so, with a good bit of intelligence, in the way a good shock comic should be. The inventiveness of the cards alone shows that being a horrible person takes a lot of creativity. Then it's what you do with those cards. To paraphrase a favorite holiday movie, some people work in profanity the way other artists might work in oils or clay... it is their true medium! Check out some of these for examples:

So, this is more than just the NC17 version of a PG13 movie... if Apples to Apples is Will Smith, CAH is Eminem; if Apples to Apples is King of the Hill, CAH is Rick & Morty. It's a George Lucas blockbuster... directed by Quinton Tarantino and co-written by Louie CK. This game has a personality and a character to it... a delightfully deranged one that believes no topic is off limits if it might bring a laugh.

I truly enjoyed (and still do with groups that I don't think could handle the content and subject matter of CAH) the basic idea of Apples to Apples, but Cards Against Humanity takes the best parts of that game and jumps way over the line with it, into a world of dark, twisted, sick, and outright explicit humor. 

It just doesn't get old, and one of the few games I have where the game play experience improves in direct proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed by the players. In fact, it's amazing how a game like this and a few drinks can turn even the most reserved and well-mannered seemingly stand-up citizens and pillars of the community into a vulgar, licentious, macabre-loving sickos.

So, leave Apples to Apples for playing at Thanksgiving with that Aunt who would become outright offended and indignant, but play CAH with interesting people with thick skins and over-active senses of humor.

I hear that those who drink prefer to play this one a "little buzzed".  Do Not Play with authority figures or people from work unless you already know their attitudes are relaxed enough to handle it.  Gameplay is simply Apples-to-Apples rules - nothing new there - but I laugh until I cry with this game.

Apples 2 Apples clone.  Suffers from the usual, "I just had the perfect card for that" syndrome.  Rated lower than Apples, because for the most enjoyment of the game I need a very specific group of players.

Best when playing with a group of witty/clever people capable of delivering/understanding satirical humor, then this could be fun with those types of players.  Unfortunately, it just comes down to the most crude/random/shocking joke with most other groups.

When this game was released I was super excited because it was inappropriate, but after playing it around 10 times I just don't enjoy it as much as people around me. Maybe I don't get it, but the joy of saying horrible things like "pac  man guzzling uncontrollably %#$" has gone from exciting to kind of corny the 10th time you hear it said.

Apples to apples, but instead of coming up with your own innuendos, it's all right there on the cards.  Fun with the right crowd in the right mood, but less clever the more you play

RATING: 4
Another iteration of "Apples to Apples", with cards purposefully made to be extremely perverse.  I would rather play "Apples to Apples" as it can be wholesome or perverse depending on your mood and the players, but CAH has no choice but to be perverse with most of the cards.

A fun party game to play with any of my friends. Sure the jokes wear thin after many games, but I don't play it that often. This is one of the few games that I think will get worse and worse the longer it sits on my shelf as pop culture references get outdated.

It's apples to apples with a mean streak.  It's the hardest I've laughed in quite some time, but I'm sure it gets stale if played too much.

It ages quickly as expected.  Great times for about 5-10 plays.  I don't think extra cards would help for my tastes.

I was excited in getting to know [thing=50381][/thing], mainly due to the laughs I heard while I was, two times, near a table in which the game was being played. And there was several of these moments in my play. However, I did found out that [thing=50381][/thing] isn't really a game, is and activity - if we were telling fishing stories, or throwing water baloons at each others, the result would be mostly the same, only probably more wet. That is because the "game" doesn't demand any type of consistency in the subject proposed by the reader - in fact, is the other way around, as there more your answer have nothing to do with the subject, better are your chances of being selected, due to the surprise, absurdity and chock effect. Also, the decision of the winning answer is 100% subjective. It is almost like that in [thing=18723][/thing], but, in this, the guilty of the round makes more sense, the one that twisted the answer the worst and the one that couldn't pass the guilty to other; still, the chosen can be picked by the Dark Overlord without any discernible reason. I did it because I could. [thing=50381][/thing] is like this, but all the time. Pretty lame for a game. The laughs are also, several times, traded for confusion and embarrassment (as when someone tells a bad joke), provoking wry smiles, as the people at the table can't understand the connection of the subject and the answer, nor even enough to laugh, because there is the amusing [i]non-sense[/i] and the plain and pure [i]non-sense[/i].

There was, as I mentioned, fun moments (the best, for me, was when the question was something like "When I got high __________ turned into ______"; and the winning answer was "When I got high 72 virgins turned into Stálin". Luckly I wasn't drinking at the time, as I laugh hard); but there is no doubt that, if were we doing thumb fights or bowling, there would also be plenty of laughs.

[thing=50381][/thing] has an expected social element - playing at random could produce results (maybe not winning, but one could probably have several cards picked, and I have seen people not all that adjusted to the game "mood" that playing randomly would probably improve their chances), but one most likely will fare better if you know what sort of person you are giving your answer to, at least remembering what sort of logic he/she applies in choosing the card: some will like gore, others movie references, others more "behaved" answers or more connected to what was proposed. This won't be a sure thing, but can help.

Still, the most outlandish answer, regardless analysis, can only go so far. Several times someone at the table had "the perfect answer" and not once I saw one of those being chosen. Therefore, you can only hope to hit a nerve, to strike a chord, in order to win rounds.

Now, is this a "game" about winning? No, of course. It a pastime, to entertain. But here I wanted to analyse the "game". It is indeed a game (without quotations) in the sense that hide and seek or a drinking game is.

For casual play, I'm in. Not something I willing to play on regular basis.

RATING: 4
can be funny

the rude gimmick wears off after a few plays, especially once you've heard a few combos again and again.  

As a game - my problem is it generally steers people towards scoring the rudest as apposed to the wittiest or actually funniest because it gets more laughs when you're with stoner drunk friends.  Not that it matters - no-one playing this game cares about the score that much they just want 'permission' to be rude...

there are better party games, this one just doesn't really do it for me.

RATING: 3
This game tries too much to be funny and fails miserably. Maybe if you drink enough it can be fun but at least in my experience it just devolves into a point where the most boring and uninteresting phedophile-joke wins every time. Game is also very random in a sense that if you get boring cards your answers will be boring..

This is an entertaining party game provided you have a group that doesn't have a problem laughing at terribly offensive things.  It is fun to say things out loud that I'd never say in polite company, and I'd be lying if I said that the game didn't make for some hilarious combinations.  The creators of the game aren't explicit for the sake of being explicit, the cards are cleverly written so that lots of different kinds of jokes come up during the game.  It is true that some cards are funnier than others and it is true that sometimes you have nothing funny to play, but the people who complain about the balance of the game are thinking about it all wrong.  I wouldn't want to play it all the time, but it is good for a laugh every once in a while.

Every complaint people make about Cards Against Humanity is on the mark. It substitutes creativity for canned responses. It mistakes shock value for comedy. It loses a replay value quickly. New players are the best way to keep the replay value up, but they also choose the most obvious combinations. I don't care about any of these complaints. It's just a bit of immature fun. However, Paul and Quinns at Sit Up And Shut Down recently made a point that I can't overlook. They claim this game is only funny to those with perfect lives. As an ethics instructor, I know the statistics on child abuse. With a one in seven chance that someone will be forced to laugh to cover up their own trauma, I fear further victimizing someone less fortunate than me. Ditto for other cards such as as those about dead babies. I'll have to do some thinking about how to address this.

Imagine the funniest card combinations that you have ever seen in Apples to Apples. Those are the LEAST funny combos you will find in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good:
-Hilarious and creatively vulgar cards
-Hearing people actually read cards/combinations
-People laugh when they read a card for the first time

Bad:
-Too offensive for some
-Players often reuse the same pairings and are disappointed when it doesn't get the same laughs
-Not as funny when you've seen all of the cards a few times
-Tired, played-out format

Overall:
You get your money's worth and it will seem like the greatest game in the world during your first few plays.  After that, you tend to only want to play with people who haven't played before as the hilarious becomes predictable quickly.  With that said, hearing someone unable to read a card without laughing or cracking up after drawing a card makes it worth bringing to the table.

It's a very popular game and many of my friends and family own it. Therefore I played it already numerous of times even though I never personally bought the game. What I can say is that it was fun for a bit, but then it got boring and eventually it got extremely bad. Making things sound reasonable is rare in this game and profanity just isn't that insanely funny, especially after seeing the same cards frequently.

Maybe the game isn't great because it's just words and plain colors, or maybe there is just way too many sentences on these cards for scenarios to turn out good. I'm not sure. However what I can say that this game might be more amusing for people who like a random, incoherent, disgusting, profanity based games. Might be great for teenagers, but very lacking for adults, and this game is also definitely not for children.

Now I wasn't by any means offended by anything nor do I dislike profanity, but this game for it to work, requires some structure to make a hilarious outcome. I've very rarely saw any. I've also played the game so much to tell you that the replayability is VERY low. Once you seen all the black cards, you felt like you've seen everything. Now you must be thinking that maybe I just didn't go through all the expansions. However I did and there is more that keep coming. It's the same thing though, you go through all the black cards and then you don't want to play again.

Chances are that I might play again because my family and friends did buy the cards and will most likely want to play, but now with Joking Hazard released, this game will soon be out of the picture. Fun while it lasted, even if it was just a bit.

This is one of those "it is what it is" games; The offensive Apples to Apples. Everyone has either heard of it or played it by now. Was pretty funny at first but my gaming group unfortunately started just targeting peoples since of humor/interests and ended up kind of ruining the game.

I'd definitely play again, but need new people to keep it fresh.

A party game for terrible people and I guess we're terrible. Not something I'd ever bring to a family gathering (Not ever!) but it's definitely a game that makes it to the table when I've got friends over (gamer or not) and we've all had a beer or two. It's a great way to wind down the night and isn't ruined if someone has to leave suddenly.
Keeper for sure, especially after a little deck customization to include inside jokes and remove the cards that everyone always discards.

And many will hate CaH and find it juvenile, full of crude sexual humor and tasteless questions. It's all true, but the true beauty of this game is revealed when the perfect place for the very un-PC cards is found.
It's more satisfying to play a "Japanese Internment Camp" than a "Two Girls and a..." you know.
In other words, I want to play this game with you if you are horrible and not simply crass. It is after all "The card game for horrible people"

I would give CaH another point or two if there was a version that was more topical and less filthy. The sex jokes get old after a few plays but the PC jokes get better.

This game is some good laughs the first time you play it, when some of the wildcards come up and the offensive jokes are fresh, it get repetitive fast. Like Apples to Apples, I similarly get annoyed if I end up with a hand of bad cards.

when this game starts to lose it's appeal get the expansions and make up your own white cards. Also good to allow a house rule redraw rule, everybody hates getting stuck with stupid cards. Another fun thing to do is to play with the Rando Carrisian house rule in the mix; this is the rule where for every black card you randomly draw a white card and add it into the mix. It is pretty fun to see how many points Rando gets.

At first the crudeness is amusing but I found it detracted from the 'game' of it.

I'd rather play Apples to Apples.

Despite the expansions, the game can overstay its welcome a bit. A lot of the time people will just pick the card that is the funniest as opposed to how it was paired with the card drawn.

June 2011: "8/10 Apples to Apples condensed down to funny cards.
Excellent game, instant hit with any people I play it with. The biggest problem is that the cards are more memorable, so there's a distinctive chance it will get old with repeated plays. But that's what expansions are for."

August 2014: "10 plays of this saw it overstay its welcome. I'd need a lot more expansions to stay interested in this. Still useful to keep around, since it's about the length and commitment level drunken college kids can handle anyway."

Another reminder that you can have a hearty laugh at a good joke exactly once. Because of this, CAH turns into a pseudo-legacy game: play it once and you might as well bin it. Oh, and I never thought I would say this about any game but there are far too many cards in the box: most of them are just too similar to each other and some of them are just not funny in any context.

Hilarious game for those with a wicked sense of humor. Some of the biggest laughs i ever had playing a game.

Does get stale pretty quickly as you get to know the cards after about 10 games.

[u][i][b] Years ago, someone told me "Its like Apples to Apples.. for ADULTS LOL" [/b][/i][/u]
I regret listening to that person. I received Apples to Apples for Xmas and it was a blast, then someone at the party mentioned about a similar game... this game. I will never forget the first time i played it, in a party, big group, pulled out apples to apples, laughter and fun times commence, THEN i brought this game.. it became soo awkward and almost killed the night. Granted, it may be that the combination of cards we got is a boner kill but a repeat play in a different group yielded a similar feel.

This game is fun if you think saying 'big black dick' in public is naughty and subversive. 

You may enjoy this game if you think combining 'my mum blushed when she heard I watched...' with 'three midgets shitting in a bucket' is hilarious. 

Your mileage may vary. My mileage was similar to a Cold War Era Skoda with multiple punctures... 

The only laugh I've had from Cards Against Humanity was reading their Facebook page and finding the joke 'How do you literally fuck yourself? Travel back in time'.

Played the game a handful of times.  I give it an 8 based on the cleverness of the cards, the simplicity of the gameplay, and would rate this a buy for anyone who loves to laugh and has a crude sense of humor.  Replay value is pretty low, though, because once you have seen all the cards they lose their shock value.  

I played last night, and I have never seen anyone be crying with laughter like a guy friend of mine was last night.  Like his face was shiny from tears.  And it happened 3 times!  So yea, booze + this game + close friends is the best.  Also, they just donated about $30,000 to public schools, so they are doing good with your money as well.

RATING: 4
Mechanically, a big improvement on Apples to Apples because of the two-card responses. Those force you to actually think creatively rather than just going on autopilot. Similarly, the more specific cards mean that you won't do as well just throwing out things at random as you do in the forebearer.

The "theme" sinks it for me. I don't find it offensive, just juvenile. Though I will admit there were more funny cards/situations than I expected. "What's a girl's best friend?" and "The patriarchy" was my favorite pairing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I think this game is good for a certain crowd, however I think that it is pushing a culture of "Look I can be offensive for the sake of being offensive". There are some cards that are so needlessly graphic that I feel are in bad taste and not actually that humorous. However if you are the type of person that loves the Seth Rogen type comedy and apples to apples and want a party game this game is for you.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After a few plays and listening to others, for me personally I don't perceive much long-term appeal. Cards' chief power is in seeing newcomers' reactions to reading cards for the first time as they combine the implications of their combinations in their head. That's fine and it is truly funny, but ultimately quite limited.

There is also for me a strong point on which I'm willing to stand: that some things should be treated with delicacy. Making a joke about rape might not make me feel uncomfortable, but if it makes someone in my group feel uncomfortable, furthermore, to the degree that they don't feel able to speak up about how they feel due to the general consensus that it should be funny, I'm failing in my responsibilities as an ambassador of this culture. Make no mistake, it's not all about me - it's about the people we commune and share time with, and I will affirm and defend that to the highest degree. You might be able to joke about abuse with your mates, fine, but don't assume that everyone is on that train, especially people you don't know, and you *are* accountable for them - for your behaviour when you're around them. It's just as easy to not joke about rape and abuse so just don't do it.

The biggest problem with this game is it really is only a game you can play once.  Yeah that first time is hilarious and you will have gut wrenching laughter all night, but then its done.  the next time you play you may have some laughs but all the jokes are done.  the only way this game is better is if you play with new people every time, that way there can be new jokes added to the pot.

RATING: 6
Either you have a rude sense of humor, or you dont. I do. So I find this game hilarious... the first time. Crippling luck is my most hated thing in games, and its in this game plenty, but if you keep score then you're playing it wrong. Don't care about who wins and just laugh and it's great. The only problem is even the funniest cards lose their laugh factors after seeing them so many times. Many of the cards are funny as one-liners, the context is secondary so using the same answer card on a different question is less and less funny until you decide it's time to retire the game. Expansions have helped, but really they only prolong the inevitable.

I enjoy this game, however it's not something I could play every day or every week. It won't work with most crowds, don't take it to a game group you don't know well, and apply the Baker Rule (play n-1 times, where n is the number of times you want to play). I also see this game getting older faster than most games due to the nature of the cards, but for the moment I'm happy to play the game and make up terrible combinations.

Also, I have to remove the Virginia Tech Massacre card, I was there when that happened.

This game uses the same mechanic as one of my favorite games (Say Anything) but instead of being a fun, light-hearted, social game that teaches you about your friends, this game is just disgusting. It's disturbing, emotionally-scaring, inappropriate, and just plain wrong. Some people have a twisted enough sense of humor to enjoy it but I think it really encourages negative thought patterns and anti-social behavior. Absolutely horrible, I'll never play it again.

Incredibly fun and hilarious game!  Not for the easily offended.

Suggested house rule: The card czar picks both his favorite and least favorite cards.  The winner, like always, gets the black card which counts as an awesome point worth +1 and the loser gets his white card back (or one of them) as a point of shame worth -1 point.  This is more fun to me since it discourages players from just throwing in their junk cards when they know they can't win.

Hilarious on a first play, but does not hold up at all in subsequent plays. Extremely sensitive to the player group. Would be better if more of the black cards had multiple blanks to allow for more crazy combination submissions and if most of the pop culture references were removed.

It's not a game you buy/play because it is 'good'. I don't even know why I rated the game a 4. Cards Against Humanity is all about the event of playing. It's not the mechanics, not even really about the theme, getting together and having a few laughs is always a great time. Cards Against Humanity does that in droves. It's relaxing and easy to play.

There's just games that do that better though and still stay a 'game.' As everything the board game medium can do, Cards gets my rating of 4. As an example of how fun a night of gaming can be it would score much higher.

Played it only once, to experience it, but I didn't enjoy it. Some of the answer cards are already complete absurdity, and thus a 'funny' answer to any question. Sometimes, due to happy coincidence, a question will match up to one of your cards, but then you will still be outdone by an absurd answer. Which means it could go well with the right group.

RATING: 6
Good for a laugh, the limited number of cards (and their heavy USA bias) means that after only a few plays it is already starting to feel repetitive though. Much better with the expansions and the ability to make custom cards.

RATING: 6.3
Great for a casual audience of 5-7 or so people when played to only 4 points.  Maybe they'll want to do a second round.  Don't play to ten for God's sake....  Unless you only have 3 or 4 people.

It's a fun mindless party game made for laughs, but it drastically loses its appeal after the novelty wears off.

RATING: 3
This game, like Apples to Apples, asks for too little input from the players. The additional input required from games like 'Say Anything,' charades, Pictionary, Taboo, Catch Phrase...etc make them all much better games than this. This great for folks that want some cheap jokes about boners, but that is all.

This is usually a game I'll play if someone really wants to play it, but a particular player keeps requesting it even though they know I despise this game which just adds to my disdain. It's good with certain groups, but really these types of games are just not for me.

Great for parties involving booze. Usually goes on a few rounds too long because no one is willing to give up that chance to find a winning combo. If you're nervous about playing this game with "new" people, just dive in. It's a fabulous ice-breaker.

Its not that I find it offensive... Its that once you've seen all the cards and there's no more shock value, you realize that there's just no real game there. Its an activity.

I knew this was pretty much "Apples to Apples" only for grown ups... but I didn't realize just how very similar the two games would be rules-wise.  I still prefer the "everybody can play" original apples... but those moments in CAH when people with dark senses of humor laugh until it hurts are pretty special too.

OK! So this game is probably like a 22 with the right group. With the wrong group it's a -10. So that averages out to 6 right? I love this games however it's replay ability is piss poor, strategy lacking, and over all shallow. However I get to make dick and vagina jokes! We play this often instead of other party games and I'm only rating it a six because it's feel wrong to rate it higher however if the scale was based on fun it'd probably be close to a 10. (If you friends are as horrible as mine).

Well, Cards Against Humanity is a contribution to the collection from my wife from before we were married.

It doesn't need much of an introduction, does it? It can be entertaining, but it tends to wear out its welcome with me fairly quickly.

It's less a game and more a social activity to me.

It's good for parties, but once you've worked through a lot of the cards, their "shock value" decreases. Not enough strategy to really hold interest. It's basically like an assisted mad libs.

Funny the first time.  I imagine it would be amusing the second time, mildly chuckle inducing the third time, and by the fourth play it would be tedious.  Probably worth pulling out once a year though for laughs.

After 2+ Plays: Mildly funny for a few plays.  After that there's a problem, because it's decidedly less fun to keep going through the same cards, but the expansions completely ruin the game by making the individual cards ridiculous (when the ridiculousness should come from the combination of the black and white cards).

Naughty Apples to Apples. Laughter left after first time through the cards. Not for me.

RATING: 1
got this as a gift. the tag line of the game should be "a party game for horny & drunk US college student" instead of "a party game for horrible people". if you're not from US (like myself), you'll find little amusement in this game as most of the cards reference US famous people and slang. Piece of garbage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's all based on shock value. The first time through can be pretty funny. But once those crazy cards have come up 2 or 3 times, virtually all the fun of the game is gone. The base game can get very boring after a couple plays.

More of an activity than a game, good for some laughs but there's many many more things I'd rather play. basically it's a dirty version of apples to apples. You can draw random cards out of the box and can lose to a player who doesn't exist.

only thing I can say: throw away your emotions, your preconceived notions of what's right and wrong, and just let the cards fall as they may. It's so wrong, it's right. You'll never laugh harder than after 10 pm playing Cards Against Humanity. Again, you just can't let this game get to you. Don't let it offend you. It's a game and your jokes here don't mean you believe those things.

Ein sehr lustiges Kartenspiel für idealerweise 4 - 7 Personen, bei dem die Begriffkarten möglichst gekonnt mit den Lückenkarten kombiniert werden müssen. Man sollte allerdings schwarzen Humor mitbringen, denn es ist alles andere als politisch korrekt. Nach einigen Runden wird es außerdem langweilig, weil sich der Humor dann doch schnell abnutzt. Für die extrem witzige Ersterfahrung vergebe ich dennoch 9 Punkte.

RATING: 2.5
An important part of this type of game is that the cards are balanced so that people don't just pick a card because it made them laugh. Apples to Apples is, in my experience, a better game when you remove the "Helen Keller" card because people look at the association between the red and green cards, rather than just picking the card that made them laugh.

CAH, of course, ignores this because they want every card to be shocking and funny to read. But it's just not possible for them all to be equally funny, so the game devolves into "who played the funniest card" with no cleverness at all.

Combine this with the fact that that type of humor is honestly pretty shallow, especially if taken all at once over a few hours, and this game really bums me out.

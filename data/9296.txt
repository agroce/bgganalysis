2010-04-14 (unrated):

First battle game I brought. And one among first games I bough. But I never played it. Didn't have anyone to play with. Also I didn't have any miniatures (except few random ones).

But the rules always seemed very interesting to me. Much Better then Warhammer systems. I would gladly play it one they.

As of today the best Sci-Fi small scale miniature rules; avoids the power play and the cheesiness of WH40K and has a more realistic combat system; plus a more tactical component and... just forget about alien dark elves.

A truly great skirmish style miniature game. The rules play very fast and allow a great deal of flexibility during game play. Great background material and artwork throughout. Unfortunately it is currently out of print.

I enjoyed this game ok.  The minis are cool (some bad) the rules good.  Problem was to much modification.  UBERCHARACTERS a major problem.

Played pre-logging est. 10-20 times

I have multiple editions and absolutely love this rules system. This was my very first Sci-Fi miniature system and to this day would pick it over Warhammer 40k. This title has been sold and resold time and time again, but it always manages to rise from the ashes.

extra cheesy and super cool.
can be quite fast, but also can have a ton of special rules, which will slow it down a lot.

My first and only Miniatures Battle Game. My favourite units were the Cybertronic's Eradicators. Few other units could resist them... We played a lot this game with my brother and I enjoyed it in its own time.

RATING: 6
Used to play a great deal of the First edition (50+ games), after doing a lot of house rules to fix the things we found wrong.  Our most effective recipe was to play objective-based games (where players scored points each turn they held an objective) with about 600 points on the table - this generally promoted the movement that the game otherwise lacked while keeping the playing time down.  Expansions suffered heavily from power creep...

I got a couple of Cybertronic troops when i played Mutant Chronicles the RPG. This was easier to find stuff for than 40k back in the day. Rules was pretty poor and contradictory.

One of my favourite wargame rules,The game meckanics of alternative activations and multiple actions for each figure makes this game a winner for me.

This game was great if you liked painting miniatures and enjoyed the setting.  The rules were rough in places, though.

The armies were just to bland - I would rather play Warhammer 40k.

My first foray into miniature gaming.  Back then (1995), the prices were right, ($8.95 US for a pack of four models) versus GW stuff.  I loved the rules as they were skirmish based, roughly 3-4 squads with and individual/hero per squad you fielded, and it was "I-go-You-go" squad by squad activation, versus the "One side" at a time WH40K rules.

RATING: N/A
Very reminicent of WH40k. It's got some obvious improvements over that system, but also has lots more micromanagement of individual troopers. Might work better as a warband game (using only independent models and no squads) than with the 30 or more models the rules recommend.

My first TTG and the one still closest to my heart. Great background and cool miniatures. Futuristic megacorporations vs the demonic Dark Legion. I have way too many of their lead miniatures.

Cool set of mini rules unfortunately every supplement/expansion broke the rules just a little more...  Core rules provide a really good "rock 'n' roll" game that's quick and exciting.

I like this for retro reasons. The game itself is pretty blech.

I have a ton of figures and would like to sell it all.

It does have Some pretty major balancing issues, especially as you added supplements that nerfed one or other army to god like status.

Fantastic game! A little clunky, but only when compared to the later two editions. So full of character it's exploding.

RATING: 6
It looks like a really great set of rules, but sadly I have barely played due to the blandness of the different armies.  WH40K just has so much more interesting army choices.

One of my favorite mini's rule systems.  It made up for what I saw as issues with 40k.  It was also my introduction to the Mutant Chronicle universe.

I remember loving this game.  A tabletop miniatures game along the lines of GW's 40K stuff, but with a bigger focus on skirmishes and better rules.  I particularly liked that every figure in your army got to do something, instead of just being cool looking damage markers for a squad.

It had a few balance issues (especially those seriously BROKEN Screaming Legionaire squads), but it was really hands down superior to 40K in every way, well, except for longevity.  A pity that it's completely and totally dead in my area.

I still have the rulebooks somewhere.  I still have the miniatures too.  Somewhere...

wont add every single book seperatly. its everything there was.
this is my favorite of all times i guess. mechanics are a dream, artwork too (mr. smith is and will be one of my favorite "painters"). the background gets me everytime i read into it, even after all these years.

A lot more fun than I originally thought. There are many options on each turn which can lead to some serious AP. Overall, the game is fun and has almost no luck. It has many of the things I like and dislike about Agricola.

Very scalable, oddly themed game that is hard to categorize.

The game plays 6 rounds, but the round lengths are variable, as they are controlled by the players and the passing action.  Each turn you take a single action from a variety of choices with your novice priests who are spread about on isles and a temple.  There are a variety of ways to score points, and there are different abilities you can access depending on the placement of your workers.  This game is very different from anything else I own and very strategic.  I really can't decide how to explain it right now, but I will say that it definitely is one of Stefan Feld's best games, and establishes Hall Games as a very good up and coming publisher (this and At the Gates of Loyang, makes them 2 for 2 in my books).

The game features more interaction than many European games, and can turn into quite a battle with players vying for position at the end of each turn. The loose theme describes a temple with an imminent vacancy for a new "Moon Priestess". The novices are trying to attain prestige in order that the most prestigious of them can choose the new Priestess. It all sounds very new-age, but the theme is very incidental. The heart of the game is its mechanics, and these are quite intriguing.

2 plays / 3 players

LIKE: An oddly themed game, but it has wonderfully tense interactions, competing with and planning against, the other players. I love the feeling of not having enough time to do all that I wanted. I really had to prioritize and plan each round, as singular actions are a small part of bigger plans. I like the candle stick burning down as a round timer. I liked the apostate and his threat to other players to deduct points.

DISLIKE: The game is odd in its theme, which makes the actions a bit unintuitive at first. The chits could have been bigger. The book action felt odd but perhaps I need to play more to see how it could be used effectively.

OVERALL: I am impressed. The way Feld designed the islands as an action selection mechanism is clever. I want to play more, but is challenging to get to the table.

Uno de los grandes eurogames de Stefan Feld! Es bastante sesudo y a la vez la forma de jugarlo y mecánica es sencilla. Tienes que planificar mucho, de ahí su dureza. Posibilidades de conseguir puntos de formas diferentes, y puteo directo e indirecto  que enriquece mucho el juego, y crea el que no vayas sólo a tu bola, y tengas en cuenta qué hacen los demás. Temática curiosa aunque pegada como suele pasar en los euros y el autor, a mi no me disgusta. Muy entretenido, se puede jugar con cualquier número de jugadores desde 1 (ya que tiene también modo solitario) hasta 4, si bien es cierto que muchísimo mejor a 4. El juego tiene también un bonito diseño y unos detalles visuales muy originales, como los puntos-lunas con la luna tan llena como los puntos o el detalle de soplar y dar la vuelta a las velas para pasar el turno :) Si escalara un poco mejor, juego de 10.

RATING: 7
Luna is a game of figuring out in which order to do the things you want so that you minimise the actions wasted in moving back and forth on the board. It is also all about keeping your momentum and staying one step ahead of your opponents because the competition for the most wanted spots is fierce. I am not sure how critical the trade-offs in this game are because at least I found myself most of the time trying to figure out the best next few steps instead of speculating between immediate gain vs. future prospects. Perhaps the most agonizing decisions were related to passing or keeping on playing. Otherwise all “trade-offs” were guesswork of what other players want.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed playing Luna. It might well be that further plays will make the game a bit boring since analysing the situation takes less and less effort. But at least for now it is a game I could play again.

Have also played a couple of times on Yucata and it seems like it should be a great gamers game but it really requires a set of players who know it well as the game revolves around the interaction of the players and I can't see it being very good with new players or AP types.

The choices are also a little too obscure so it doesn't feel like its quite as good as In the Year of the Dragon which also thrives on such player interaction.

Abstract:
"Luna: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess" is a mystical combination between area-control and worker (novice) placement by Stefan Feld. All four cults (players) must gain influence to become the successor of Luna - the title character. The game comes with different boards: a central temple isle surrounded by small, free-floating isles. Players can do 4 types of actions: isle, movement, temple, and other actions. Some of these actions require Favor tokens which must be acquired on the different isles by the novices.

Isle actions:
a) Favor: gain a favor token from an isle
b) Recruit: add one novice on an isle
c) Shrine: build a shrine on an isle with the master builder (requires shrine token)
d) Herbs: inactive novices become active again (requires herbs token)

Movement actions:
a) Journey: move active novices - they become inactive
b) Tide: move any novices - they become inactive (requires tide token)
c) Sailboat: move 1 or 2 active novices - they remain active (requires boat token)

Temple actions:
a) Promotion: claim a temple tile (may use bribe token to get behind the temple guard)
b) Sanctification: place a novice in the temple to gain influence points (may use bribe token and may displace novices of other players)
c) Book: protect one novice in the temple and gain 1 influence point (requires book token)
d) Council: move up on the council track used for tie-breaker and for influence points at game end

Other actions:
a) Expulsion: move the apostate in clockwise order
b) Virtual novice: replace a novice during another action
c) Meditation: turn a time token (pass)

Note: Most actions requires at least two novices on an isle. An existing temple or a virtual novice may replace one novice.

Pros:
+ Puzzly novice movement (and shrine building) on the isles: it is about clever distribution to maximize efficiency and options to claim the temple tiles but also to compete with other players
+ Tricky area-control in the temple and on the isle with the moon priestess 
+ Race game to claim the temple tiles
+ Players decide the end of a round by passing: a tense mechanic that puts pressure on all other players
+ The temple guard (also the round marker) limits what temple tiles players have access to during a round
+ 14 simple actions are available - their combination provide many choices
+ Helpful player aids with a very good iconography
+ Plays well with all player counts (2-4)
+ Cool big puzzle pieces to create the center board (temple)
+ Rules are good: 
 * quite short (2 pages for set-up and examples, 2 pages for actions, 1 page for final scoring)
 * comes with a pre-selected set-up for the first game + some tips
 * one ambiguous rule (due to translation) about scoring when kicking novices out of the temple (in the first print, may be fixed in later versions)

Neutrals:
# The most thematically game by Stefan Feld so far
# Unusual theme
# Unusual worker placement game: players do not collect or produce crops or goods, players do not block an isle with their workers
# Solid components and artwork
# No hidden information and no luck - analysis paralysis might be an issue
# Randomization by changing the order of isles, the starting position of the novices, and modular temple each game
# All elements are used each game (there is nothing new or fundamental different each game)
# Indirect, quite competitive player interaction: controlling the moon priestess or apostate, claiming temple tiles, kicking other novices out of the temple
# The apostate can be quite tense but also annoying: players usually try to postpone their actions in order to react on movement of the apostate (players lose points, if they have novices on the isle with the apostate)
# A strategical game about planning ahead and sometimes reacting tactically
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Not easy to teach (unintuitive, overwhelming number of actions)
- Solo variant lacks of excitement

Thoughts:
Luna is an unusual game. The unusual theme supports it even more. Luna does worker placement very differently. I like the mix between worker placement and area control, especially the competition in the temple. What I like most is that players define the end of a round which creates a lot of pressure on players to get their plans done in time. However, you usually will not get everything done what you wanted.

Similar to:
* AquaSphere (players collect robot tiles to do actions similar to isle tiles, pawn movement, area control, very thinky)

Player: 1-4 | Time: 60-100m

1st play: I'm glad I finally got this game to the table. Lots of different combinations and ways to blend, as well as a sense that you get one chance to build on each island, makes every action count. The fact that you can push the end of the round, and control the actions of the various figures make this an enjoyable game.

2nd play: Great game, one of my favorite Felds and it's going on my breakup list. The tight decisions and mostly predictable patterns of the personalities make this a very strategic game, but with tactical elements depending on how fast the other players are pushing the rounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lovely, different, probably about an hour for a rather deep and intense game.  Unfortunately, part of that hour is quite repetitive, at least so far:  the power of the wave action, the repeated need to acquire it and the shrine token, the relative weakness of the sailboat, bribe, and (especially) book tokens make things too similar and limit interesting options.

The player interaction here is startlingly strong; the freedom the game gives you is striking; and it has a rather large game arch despite it's incremental feel; tactical and yet it forces you to look forward to the next round constantly; and there is no in-game luck. Brilliant composition; beautiful game artwork. Congratulations, Stefan, Klemens, and Ralph!

One of my favourite Stefan Feld games along with In the Year of the Dragon and Trajan. It has the strategic elements you meet in Caylus and Tzolkin but in my opinion a better visual appearance and a nicer theme. Excellent game, very underestimated it should be at least in the top 50 of BGG. I think maybe bad promotion or because it's hard to find made that rank lower than it should be. Do yourselves a favour and if you find it anywhere get it ASAP!

1-4(4)

UPDATE: Some of the actions feel a bit weaker. The bribe doesn't get chosen too often, though it CAN often be used to great effect (securing a temple token that will evict a bunch of novices, say) and the ship seems to be chosen quite often.

I do have to say it's quite enjoyable. I'm not sure if it surpasses Notre Dame, Macao, or Die Burgen von Burgund, but there's a lot of tension in the game. Using two novices to get another is quite a commitment, given such few novices in a pretty short game, but the extra novice all game is a great boon. Lots of factors to manage, lots of moving parts.

-------------------------------------------------------

Not really "punishing" like some of Feld's other offerings, but it's certainly very tight, with a decent amount of stabbiness. It's still a pretty abstract Euro, with Feld's trademark mishmash of mechanisms (which I don't mind).

But, wow, are there a whole lot of options to do on any turn (helped along by the fact that the placement of your acolytes will limit your immediate options). And the various isles do feel reasonably "balanced" ... obviously in a contextual manner (Bribery's utility is limited, or the Book, etc.). A lot of the actions are to set up futures turns, but with relatively few rounds and how some of this setup deactivates your acolytes, it's a pretty expensive option ... and losing acolytes to the temple is valuable, but limiting ... and the dock ... etc.

Okay, I like it a fair bit.

Excellent medium-weight eurogame. Smart mechanics as always from Mr Feld. Well done! I especially liked the mechanic with the candle, you can never be sure how long the round will last. Its up to the players. Each player on his turn selects one of the 14 available actions. Almost no downtime. All information is open, there is nothing random in the game. There is more player interaction in Luna than in other typical eurogames. High quality components with nice artwork. Very enjoyable game.

Very interesting game! Love the player interaction, the open-ended-ness. Balancing your own plans against a need to respond to what your opponent is doing is challenging and fun. The variable setup and board arrangement of the islands is a very cool feature. The fact that it comes with a good solo variant is a plus as well.

The theme works amazingly for me. Somehow I really feel like I'm gathering herbs in the moonlight, riding the tides, or throwing candles out the window after a meditation session! Great artwork and components.

January 2012:  Luna is a different kind of game.  Nothing quite like it.  Every fan of euro's and worker placement games ought to try it out.  I am impressed with the originality and want to play Luna again to get a better sense of it.

April 2014:  Finally played Luna a second time, wow, after a two year wait! (I picked up a copy of my own at Essen 2013) On second play, I am still impressed with its originality and puzzle-like mechanics with lots of tough and fun decisions in what is really a no luck game with unexpected "showdowns" and "stare-downs" possible.  A certain unique intensity in this game.  All four players (seasoned gamers) want to play it again tonight.  

I LOVE the fact that this game is thematically original, and fun(ny) to play around with.  Lots of fun playing around with Luna and the Apostate.   

I decided to play Tom Petty's classic (though obscure) song "Luna" from his first 1976 album, while setting up the game, causing laughter and smiles.  A sample of the lyrics:

"The night was all clouded with dreams, 
wind made me shiver
Black and yellow pools of light, outside my window
Luna come to me tonight
I am a prisoner
Luna...glide down from the moon"

I ask you:  what other Feld title has a related song?!  Bottom line:  this game is an amusing board game classic!

+ Brain burner-ish abstract little game. It asks for several turns planning in advance, and adds an interesting twist to the worker placement mechanic.
- For the effort it asks on planning, may be a bit frustrating because there's a lot you can't. Since so many actions are possible, it makes the other players' actions much harder to predict. Ridiculous theme.
I'm also not sure about how fun it is.

The moon goddess demands your attention.  In order to fulfill her requests, you'll have to work and plan carefully.  Why?  Because everything is related.  You'll do this to enable that to complete another so that you can attempt your primary purpose.  It's all a series of connected efforts that must be brought together in just the right order and timing to find success.  If you find your head swimming at first, fear not.  The game can be overwhelming at first, but will quickly fall into place.  A rich game experience that gamers will enjoy.  A solid game worthy of many plays.

RATING: 7.9
A lovely but strange Feld game which, like many of his other designs, is all about the points, but they feel a little tighter here than usual. You're placing and moving Novices around these isles (which can be randomly set up around the central Temple board) and taking actions by deactivating them or using Favor tokens. There is also an additional Area Control element on the central Temple board, and the setup for this is unlike any other game in my collection. Thematically it's vague at best, but still pretty cool that he would explore this mild fantastical concept with such blatantly Euro mechanics.

Stefan Feld hihetetlen sokoldalúságának ékes bizonyítéka a játék.
Nem csak, hogy az Ő általa jegyzet játékok egyikéhez sem hasonlít (az alkalmazott mechanizmus terén), de az általam ismert játékokban sem találtam hozzá hasonlót.
Talán a szerző legösszetettebb, és leginkább "agyégető" játéka.
Egy gyengébb helyezés elérésekor ne a szerencse elmaradását okoljuk - hiszen minden előre tervezhető, kiszámítható. Aki ebben ügyesebb, az fog jobban szerepelni.
Nagyon sok mindenre kell figyelni (!!!), és az alkalmazható akciók száma, valamint azok "egymásba fűzése miatt" semmi esetre sem egy könnyű játék.
A társasjátékok világában kezdeti lépéseiket tevő játékosokkal meg se kíséreljük játszani...
Én eddig csak a Neulandnál tapasztaltam meg ezt az érzést - szinte a játék utolsó harmadában kezdtem csak átlátni a játékot. (addigra azonban már késő volt...)
A sok alkalmazható lehetőség ellenére a játék - megfelelő szubjektumok esetén - nem lassul le, hiszen a cselekedetek jó része előre tervezhetőek.
A grafika és a megjelenés ugyan nem az én ízlésvilágom, de nagyon nincs is idő nézegetni, mert gondolkodni kell...
Így első játék után : "5" , de nagyon meg lennék lepve, ha további játékokat követően pozitív megítélésem mértéke nem emelkedne.

ps. most látom, hogy egyedül is játszható... - de vajon hogyan?

At last, a quality production in comparison with the other good Feld games.Luna is not better that Macao,Im Jahr des Drachen,Notre dame, but it is one of Feld's games. GODS, why the production on the previous ones was so poor?
About the gameplay:I find Luna a bit abstract,particularly inside the monastery but I like the different abilities of the resources. Excellent visual result and overall artwork. It is an action management game, you try to do the most things with the less transfer actions. Pretty original mechanism but not that much fun.

Luna is quite a solid euro. The game is about acquiring influence points for 6 rounds to become the order from which the new moon priestess is selected.
In each round, every player gets a variable number of actions, and the whole process is about moving novices among isles and activating them to acquire benefits, build shrines and, finally, get them to the temple.
There's a wide range of different actions (somewhat the first game has an overwhelming feel), and every action is a micro-step toward optimization and victory.
The end-of-round mechanic is quite interesting, and gives players a control on round duration and a weapon against others.
Overall, I am quite impressed by the game, but it needs some more plays for an accurate assessment. Starting rating is 7.

There is zero luck this time around, which is atypical for Feld.  The theme is a little looney and so are the actions, but the gameplay is solid.   

Feld has come up with an ingenious way to keep the game fresh and replayable.  The scoring locations rotate every round based on a "Luna" cycle. Sounds weird and vague, but I am unable to explain it in an interesting and/or concise manner. 

Update:  Son of a gun!  I was taught the game with slightly incorrect rules.

Short rules don't result in a shallow game. Subtle oportunities to bump the opposition and a bit of strategy to cope with too. I get the impression this one will grow with more plays.

Played a bit on line but first f2f play was so much better. Very close scores at the end and very cut throat. Shame the rule book is so vague. We knew the game from Yacata but struggled like hell to agree key points from the rule book. Raw novices would struggle with this document.

RATING: 7
After one play, I can say this is one of the more opaque titles which I've played from Feld.  It shares the same basis of simple mechanics as most of his other games, there simply seem to be more to choose from, and in longer chains before they yield the ever-desirable points.  I wouldn't call this a point-salad in the vein of Castles of Burgundy.  While there are many strategies to earn points, there are also multiple ways to lose them, and some require you to expend many actions to obtain.

At the end of my game I found myself only slightly wiser as to how to win...that's probably good in terms of replayability, but it didn't do much for the fun factor.  I think of all of the Feld's I've played (Trajan, CoB, ND, LI, Macao), this one seems to require the most long-term planning.  My rating and the fun-factor will likely rise with plays, but I'm not sure it'll end up as high as I would expect for being one of Feld's most-beloved games on the 'Geek.

Interesting twist on worker placement game.  Your workers need to be moved from island to island so I hesitate to even call it worker placement...... It's more like worker usage..... I dunno.  It's a worker placement game but it plays out much differently than other worker placement games.  Great mechanics.  Lots of ways to win.

A non-point salad Feld design that requires you to utilize and move novices as you puzzle your way through a variety of limitations, challenges and opportunities.  Not my favorite Feld, but have semi-enjoyed the solo play.

After one play, I see this as a quality game and probably Feld's best.  It includes quite a bit of planning... quite a bit more than most of his games.  I look forward to playing it again.

I still like it after two plays, but no longer see it as Feld's best. Just another decent Feld.

Only two plays so far but, right now, this is a strong "okay".  It can't hold a candle to Trajan or CoB and is the least intuitive, and most abstract, Feld I have played thus far.  It is a decent game but I never feel any excitement while playing nor a strong desire to play it again.

I guess in the author’s intentions Luna had to be a fantasy game: the way it plays shows at least he tried his best when attempting this crossover. Yet eurogames and fantasy don’t get along well and as a matter of fact the end result is pretty anonymous, a soulless game where you perform actions just because you have your wooden pieces here and there: the true essence of any eurogame. Nonetheless, Luna makes for extreme game planning: a player could set his actions even before he starts playing and then blindly perform all of them nearly without being troubled by the other players’ plays.

I have to acknowledge though that while playing Luna I felt, for the first time in an eurogame, some more randomness and imprevedibilty than usual, if not because each player’s starting places (thus their starting resources) aren’t the same for all but slightly different.

Superb medium-heavy Eurogame: 2 parts tactical, 1 part strategic, and virtually no luck. The game is visually stunning, delivers a good deal of tension and unique mechanics, scales well 2-4 players (haven't played solo). And, yes, it is thematic.  Luna and Bora Bora are my 2 favourite Feld games. Excellent instructional/review video here http://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/5192/luna/drakkenstrikes-luna-components-breakdown-video-rev

Really, really good. This game feels like a Kramer and Kiesling game, with action points being sort of represented by your novices. A bit of chicken, a bit of a race, but very interesting.

I'm glad I got this as it is a great game of not being able to do every thing you want.  I like how the players can drive the pace of the game.  This game, in how it plays, allows for a lot of creativity and so far it seems like there are many ways to go to get points.  I have only played with two but with two it goes very quickly.  Very much a Feld game.  Some board work, his working some sort of wall, trade off on points versus options.  Feld has been on fire the last few years, hasn't he?

Sept 2012 - just another note.  I really enjoy games where the players can push the end of a round/game. This one has it!

Van konfrontáció ebben a játékban, de a játékmechanika különösen érdekes. Kicsit nehéznek érzem a játékot abból a szempontból, hogy bővel embermozgatás szűkébe kerül az ember. Eléggé sokat kell gondolkodni ahhoz, hogy a sziget között jó logisztikát állítson össze az ember. Rengeteg érdekes mozzanat van a játékban, mely magát a nyerési lehetőségeket megbolondítsák és az újrajátszhatóságot a nagyok között tartsa. De mégis úgy érzem, hogy talál ez mégis kevés.

Strange game. I think Luna needs several plays before you see it's hidden beauty. Will have my group the patience?

I liked it, but less than I expected.

Wanting to try the solo game.

*update*

Traded away and didn't regret. After playing this in www.yucata.de a few times, I find myself unable to learn how to play well, this game has one of the highest learning curves I have played, way beyond my level of tolerance. I agree that, normally, the games start to shine after several plays, but this doesn't so I'm happy I traded this game.

In this game you never can progress as in others like Puerto Rico in which you can make a building's combo and start up the Money or VP machine. Here you are always optimizing actions trying to take a little advantage from the other players, but with no sense of progress.

In conclusion, it's a weird game. I'm very sorry Stefan Feld is turning into "colder designs" far away from his early gems like Notre Dame, In The Year of the Dragon or Die Speicherstadt.

An odd theme of jumping in to the sea to get things done. Then getting out of the sea again to prepare to jump in once more. 

Once you look past that there's some interesting game aspects here as different islands that you jump from give you different possible benefits which you can then use to help place workers in the central area of the board. 

There's an odd thing here about if you are on a book you're safe from being displaced by others placing their own meeples in hexes of the central area located next to your own pieces. 

Quite odd, but interesting enough to warrant playing - maybe even more than once!

This is one of the few games I didn't understand by just reading the directions. It took about three rounds before it really started making sense. Once the different actions began to make sense, the game play really began to fascinate me. This is a highly under-rated, probably because of the theme, which I find to be a big plus. This will get many more plays (as expected!)  Follow up many months later-yet to pull it out again.  Hmmm...  Finally pulled it out again, stiff learning curve still, but the variations of possible choices have bumped this to a 9 from a 7.  Definite keeper.

A nice worker placement game. I really like the theme. I read that some people think the theme is pasted on, and I don't understand why the feel that way. The meeples represent actually people in this game, unlike in most other worker placement games where placing a worker represent a more abstract concept of committing your tribe/nation/whatever to a certain action. In this game your meeples are traveling from island to island in order to gain favors from the locals. Only the scoring (and the placement in the center island) feel rather abstract to me. 

I think there are many interesting decisions to be made in this game. I haven't quite figured out yet how to play well.

May 2011:   JT kind of talked this one down while explaining the rules, but it ended up being quite a good game.  There are a lot of decisions to make, and they all seem fairly important.   

The tradeoffs are well designed too (island people vs temple people, take future tiles vs having people tied up, kick people out freeing them up vs losing pts, etc etc).   

The board presentation is pretty nice too, and I like the island idea and the planning ahead aspects.   Complaints about the theme seem a little shallow... I didn't think it was any more contrived than most others games.
 
Not a game that will become a regular play, but I liked it.  Initial rating 8.

I was convinced that this would be the game that broke my Feld streak. I held off on buying it for over a year because I thought the theme was stupid, the "board" looked convoluted and confusing, and the rules seemed unintuitive and impossible to remember. I still agree with all of that.

However, the game is great. There are lots of tough choices, the scoring is tense, and the game has all of the "point salad"/multi-paths-to-victory qualities that we've come to know and love in Feld's designs. (yes, you too!)

I'd say Luna stands apart by its totally open playspace: you have no individual scoring goals, and you don't have your own player board, so you have to maximize your actions based on your initial placement and the placement of the NPC figures. The game reminds me a little of Macao because you really do have to plan two, three turns in advance to score well, and bad planning can screw you royally on your last couple of turns, especially as you keep losing workers to the central temple. Great, challenging game.

Luna is probably the best Stephen Feld game that I've played. As is indicative of Feld, it maintains absolutely no useful connection between the theme and the gameplay. But there are some interesting decisions to puzzle out. My initial impression was that the fun of the game primarily consists of figuring out the systems (of which there are many), but that the game is likely to get fairly repetitive once you've reached the point of real understanding.

I would say my one play was a 6.5, but the perceived lack of interplay variety means I'm rounding down.  The art is pretty.

[u]April 2014:[/u] Meh... Not a bad game, there are tons of stuff you can do in the game but they all award you one or two points. In the end there felt like there was no specialization occurring, it seemed like an accounting trick: if you choose action A you'll get 1 pt and 2 pt next turn, if you take action B you'll get 3 pts... In the end, it really did not interest me, there was no sense of progression or of doing anything worthwhile. You could do a little of everything, or focus on one thing, who cares? It all feels the same.

There are so many hard, but good, choices to make in this one. The end of round timing in this is interesting because players don't necessarily know when the round is going to end,thus adding another layer to the game. This is a hard game to get to the table because it is a tad longer, and   a little hard to grasp. Great game to pull out every now and then for a change in scenery. It's Feld with some theme, gotta like that.

This game continues to get better the more often I play.  Which means I wish I played it even more often.  Has a distinct "Feld feeling" to is, since there are many different ways to accumulated points.  That might be why I like it so much.

There are some neat things going on in this game, from prioritizing the things you want to get done in a turn to a subtle game of chicken that happens when choosing the candles to end the round.  Multiple paths to victory combined with a good mix of strategic decisions (you know where the good/bad guys are moving to) with tactics (doing stuff/prolonging the round for others) make me want to play this again.

Rated a 7 After 1 play, but has potential to move up.  It depends on how the variable setup plays out.  The meditation action was a let down.  I thought it would be better that it actually is.  If you are the only player trying an efficient engine, then you spend all your moves meditating while others are scoring.  Bumped it up to 8.5 after a couple 2 player games.  2 player games are very strategic.  Variable seetup was really good.

Joguinho fantástico! Diferente de tudo que eu joguei. Inovador, bem desenhado, estratégico, elegante, divertido, tenso, inteligente, enfim... não faltam adjetivos! Sem falar na ausência quase que total da sorte! Quero jogar muitas e muitas vezes ainda!

No jogo você tem que promover aprendizes de feiticeiros ao tempo, e com isso ganhar pontos de influencia. Os aprendizes saem das 8 ilhas sagradas que ficam ao redor do tempo. Cada ilha possui tokens que lhe conferem algum "poder" especial, como mover aprendizes, construir santuários, subornar o guardião do templo, dentre outros.

Destaque para as velas que vão sendo apagadas pelos jogadores para simbolizar o término de um turno, bem como o guardião do templo que vai caminhando ao longo do jogo, até chegar ao seu destino final (o templo), momento em que o jogo se encerra e contam-se os pontos de influência (pontos de vitória)

Wonderful planned-sequence efficiency game, with some direct and indirect conflict. You can see traces of Trajan in this one, and it is equally well crafted. Both strategic and tactical, you should have an overall plan going in to make the best of the initial placement, but you also need to keep alert to react to opponents moves. 

The art and theme and nice and non-intrusive. It takes a few plays for the game to settle, so don't give up after a game or two. People that have complained about fiddliness and uninvolved mechanisms, owe to play this a few times more. 

Vintage Feld, and less of a point salad than Trajan. Just lovely.

I really enjoyed this game. It has a interesting mechanic, which is akin to worker placement, and there is a lot going on. Very difficult to think through all the combinations and permutations, so better just to play (at least the first time around) and see what happens. First game played the winner had 74 points, followed closely by two players on 73 points and one on 70 points. Surprisingly close scores at the end.

WOW!!! This game is crazy good. To Or maybe it was just custom made for me. Not that I'm any good at it (only 1 play so far), but wow just it just work for me. Normally I'm not the hugest fan of zero-randomness games (even Hansa Teutonica has a little randomness with the bonus chit draws), but here it works perfectly. It's also the perfect balance of player interaction. I love action selection games, and here the cool twist is that many of the actions require a token to accompany them, so you have to acquire that before you can do it, and thus the tokens a player has in front of them telegraphs the types of things they can do. The pacing of turns is also perfect. One action per player. But the really subtle thing is how the round ends. It keeps going until people have collectively passed 4 times, not in a row, just total. The first pass can be a bluff, but really puts pressure people, since they're never sure whether each action will be their last for the round before scoring. The only slight blemish is that there is one action that steals something from someone else, and you simply choose who to steal from. I'm not a big fan of arbitrary stealing. It didn't seem too terrible in our first play, but I'm also thinking of maybe a rule to apply to make it deterministic whom to steal from. But that's a very minor point. The game just rocks. By far Feld's best, and oddly, doesn't feel at all similar to his previous games.

While playing Luna for the first time I was getting rather irritated by what I perceived to be lack of control. People where doing what they wanted left and right, but not me. But after mulling it over, I came to the conclusion that this was largely illusionary: there [i]is[/i] a lot of control in this game, because this game is almost played solitary. The Moon Priestess causes a relative scoring; the Apostate too, but can be moved by the players so in that effect allows for some control; the temple is of course subject to direct interference; and the Council is again a relative measurement. The only other thing where the players 'meet' is in the timing of the round: this can cause stress and prioritisation.

The rest of the game you play alone, despite sharing islands with your opponents. Also, since Priestess and Builder move in a precise and known way, you can plan ahead for what you want to do when. And once you realise [i]that[/i], you also realise that 'just winging' it is the completely wrong approach to take with Luna. Luna is about precisely planning your strategy with clockwork precision, and hopefully not getting your wings cut by premature blowing out of candles. I think that in the end, that mechanic might actually be the most influential one in the entire game, because it puts the squeeze on everyone to prioritise and consider less efficient paths to points. In fact, Luna is not unlike Stefans later title Trajan, which too features a clockwork planning aspect as well as a means to put time pressure on other players. But there it is linked to the amount of pawns you move, not the fact that you think it time [i]that[/i] the end of a game round draws nearer.

Luna is an unusual game in that really none of its mechanisms bears a resemblance to other games. That is a Good Thing. It is fully deterministic, and comes with perfect information, also a Good Thing—provided there isn't too much player chaos, and that appears to be the case. But it's a weird game to play all the same. The subject is completely bonkers; even for Feld it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm not really sure if this is a game I [i]should[/i] play more often: there seems to be an awful lot of preparation going on for—pointwise—meager returns. It may be a challenge to go through the motions to get to that point, but I'm not convinced it's a challenge I value. That said, there is definitely a bit of attraction to the game, and wouldn't mind playing again, so I'm going to be 'lunient' with the rating. Perhaps if I can secure a copy for a low price that I might succomb.

[b]Update[/b] With the reprint announced and appearing several years ago I immediately purchased a copy at Spiel Usually these new releases are to be had for very fair prices. It took quite some time again before I could play the game anew... and I was happy to realise that my insights had stood the test of time. Indeedy, planning for when the various characters show up where is crucial. Planning for how you want to move your novices through the isles is, too. And then there is that oh-so-nasty time/meditation squeeze. Luna may not be a game of in-your-face interaction, but the thumbscrews sure do hurt a lot! All in all the game has definitely made a lasting impression. The only thing which bugs me a little is the game's long-term perspective. With timing an important aspect, I expect weasling for points to take an ever closer seat to the front row, and that is something I'd rather not want to see in this title because the planning can be done so meticulously. I guess the only way is to find out...

In any case, I've had quite a lot of fun, and upped the rating to an easy 7. Depending on how Luna behaves herself in the upcoming dozen hands, there is definitely potential to rise to an 8. Not a bad score for a game I originally shunned as a vampire shuns sunlight and garlick.

This is an interesting game. It is typical Feld. There are lots of scoring mechanisms and the key is to get synergy. The placement of units requires more pre-planning than in many of his other games. The game is very abstract with little connection between the theme and the mechanics.

On paper the games seems very simple. To play it well requires a lot of thought. The decision making process makes this quite a heavy game.

Once you overcome the incredible complexity of the rules, you discover that the game is very easy to grasp.  But then you realize that the choices you have to make ARE complex and this game isn't easy at all!

Luna is a game of planning out a series of moves as far in advance as you can, but time is ticking away.  Most ways a player gets points can't be claimed with just one action.  Want to build a shrine?  You need a shrine favor.  And you need to be on the same isle as the Master Builder.  But your novices are all on the Herbal and Book isles - what to do?

Handsome components, different set-up options to keep things interesting and a solid concept makes for a very enjoyable game.  I'm smitten.

Played 4 player game at BGG.Con.
I should probably play it again to get a better feel for it, but it seemed like there was too much going on and you weren't really accomplishing anything.
I love the look of the game. The art is quirky and there are a series of mini boards surrounding the main board.
Most of the actions didn't seem very intuitive.
There's definitely strategy in the game and not a lot of luck, but I'm not sure the action choices make a lot of sense.

Wow, i've been wanting to check this out for a while because I love Feld and it's very intriguing to repeatedly hear how this is a "weird" game that seems to live in it's own universe, not easily compared to others.  After 3 plays, I have to say I agree.  And it's got its hooks in me.  A fascinating puzzler that's very lean and clean, once you understand how it works (which does take a play through).  Perfect information game that has at first subtle, but then you realize very crucial, player interaction that causes it to be really tactical and puzzley and competetive with each play through.  It's a game of outmanuevering your opponent, which is something I came to realize only after a few plays, and makes for an awesomely tense and tight game.  Planning ahead is crucial, and is a brain burn, but not overwhelmingly so.  The rounds are fast and their specific length is determined by the players actions, so a round can effectively be made super short by the players if they wanna lay on the pressure or stop your plans in their tracks.  scoring and setup between rounds is lightning fast for a Feld, and ways of scoring points are just a handful compared to his more salad-y titles.  I for one love the theme and the art.  You gotta get into it!  The novices gain influence if they 1.  Attend Luna's service, 2. build shrines to her, or 3. worship in the temple.  Explain those three things thematically to new players and I think the game will make more sense in their heads quicker.  Excellent interactive puzzler.

RATING: 8
Fun open information Euro. Feld is certainly good at designing games that do not feel at all like each other. This one is probably my favorite of those I've played by this designer.

In this one, players are using novices to move around the seven islands collecting bonus chits to assist with the many actions possible to earn VPs. Offers a respectable amount of player interaction through fighting over Temple spots and moving of the Apostate, who deducts VPs.

Would like to play this more.

Update: Four plays now, all with either 3 or 4 players. Love it. The Meditation mechanic is brilliant, and feels unique. It allows you to pass and see what your opponents are going to do, but there's also a risk in that they will also meditate causing the round to end before you get to finish your actions. In a game that requires a lot of preplanning and setting up for future turns, this could be critical. 

I love the jockeying for position in the temple as well as the competition for scoring of the Moon Priestess. The Council of Priests track is also enjoyable. Building the 4 point Shrines on islands should not be overlooked, and damn that Apostate! Wonderful game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Seems like a mostly tactical exercise in action efficiency. There is some interaction with deciding when to trigger actions but if you wait too long, someone may end the turn or game before you can complete all the actions you want to maximize points. A unique game but one that doesn't seem complex enough to be interesting in the long term despite the variable setup.

Admittedly this was my first Stefan Feld game, and I really enjoyed it from the start. The theme is weird, but I felt like the theme and story of the game made the mechanics easy to understand! I was able to jump right in. I hope to play more in the future.

Toss a few familiar mechanisms into a pot, season with a new mechanism or two that purport(s) to elevate the game above the ruck, stir together with unintuitive (although not necessarily fiddly) rules, adjust the flavors as playtesting suggests, and then sprinkle on a theme, and you get Luna and a dozen other game meals a lot like it.
These kinds of games tend to work for me, but some work better than others, and it is difficult to pinpoint why. This one is more enjoyable than many in the genre, possibly because you do not have to remember or re-learn the benefits of a plethora of cards from game to game. Once you have a handle on the actions, you're done referring to cheat sheets.

Luna might very well be my favorite Feld game. What makes Luna great in my book are the alternating turns between players combined with the variable round length. The round structure really forces you prioritize your actions. Once someone passes for the first time, the pressure is on. So even if you have a great engine allowing you to do a million things, you might not be able to do so because someone else just ends the round. This leads to some tense decisions. The level of interaction is also quite high. You're competing for majorities on the seven islands and in the temple which makes you watch your opponents closely. Great game!

RATING: 6
This game is ok.  Nothing about it pulls me to want to play it again right away.  I think part of the problem, if you can call it that, is you need to pull apart your engine at the same time you are building it.  So effectively most of the game feels a lot the same.  But there are things to think about.  It's ok.

Feld's diceless game in his earlier years. To me there is much more meat in this game than his dice games although this game is not famous. This game offers players plenty of choices to make in each turn and it's quite intimidating to new gamers. The overwhelming of choices could either throw you off or allows you to see many challenging moves. Great game.

RATING: 5
Luna was reasonably interesting. It did not wow me, but I found it entertaining and dynamic enough to play twice. I expect I will get around 8-10 plays out of it, but I am not sure it meets my interplay variety and interaction requirements to get more out of it then that. 

The general idea is that you are competing to get influence points so that, at the end of 6 rounds, your order is established as that from which the new moon priestess is selected. On any given round there are a number of actions that are mostly centered around repositioning your novices on various islands so that you can take advantage of what the island has to offer: special action tokens, the ability to place a novice in the temple, and the ability to gain influence if the moon priestes is present or build a shrine if the builder is present. Shrines have the advantage of giving a nice chunk of victory points but also make actions more efficient, allowing you to do a lot of actions that would otherwise require 2 actions with only 1. The round ends after the pass/candlestick action is selected four times. 

The games variability comes from the random, intial configuration of the islands, how the temple tiles are placed in the beginning, how the players configure their initial shrine and initial 8 novices, and the initial positions of the apostate, moon priestess, and builder. A lot of these are player-influenced, so there is a possibility it will allow me to maintain my interest over an extended period of play, but that remains to be seen. I suspect there is quite a bit of room for skilled play in the game, and that alone seems fairly promising. 

One of the things that stood out most about the game, and sort of reminded me most of Hansa Teutonica, is that there are a lot of little different ways to get victory points that sort of overall form a tapestry of scoring. Some are larger than others (scoring in the temple is worth 6 victory points at the start of the game, but increasingly less as the game goes on, probably due to the opportunity cost involved with putting a novice in the temple rather than more infrastructure-based scoring), but how you manipulate the scoring system and how effective you are at taking advantage of opportunities, both scoring and otherwise, that present themselves is an important skill.

Additionally, because of the fact that there is no randomness after the first round, and the relatively low amount of chaos, it is possible to put together a general strategy/plan and focus on that throughout the game. This is not to say you can ignore the other players. It has the typical eurofied competition for scarce resources (scoring opportunities in the temple in this case) as well as a PoMP-style mechanic where the round ends after four passes are taken, so individuals have room to pressure each other. 

Unfortunately, further play disenchanted me on Luna. Most any VP path you pursue provides the same amount of victory points/action ratio, so individual paths do not matter, so much as how efficient you are, and while pure efficiency exercises can be fun, Feld is pretty bad at doing so.

RATING: 9
Players are members of a religious order, trying to earn enough influence points to elect one of their order to the post of moon priestess.  Super solid game where players do a sort of reverse worker placement, pulling workers off the board in order to take actions.  Actions allowable are taken from a list of 14 possibilities!  These include moving workers, picking up ability chits, crashing into the temple to score points and oust others, and so on.  Points are scored for all sorts of things, but what appears to be an out of control mess is actually a surprisingly tight and tense game, with ample opportunity for planning and clever plays.  Several nice ideas, particularly the meditation mechanic, which gives players with nothing to do, or little to do to their advantage, the chance to apply some time pressure on the others.  Lovely game - one of Feld's best... possibly his best.  Interesting that this didn't appear from Alea...

RATING: 10
I wasn't sure what to expect about this game but my first impression is that it is quite interesting and challenging.  There is a lot going on in the game, leading to some tough decisions, and the candle mechanic used to end the round adds a lot of tension. I also enjoyed the art and general theme of the game, even if some of the thematic connections for the mechanics were a bit weak.  This is a similar issue for Macao as well, by the same designer. The interactions of the mechanics are certainly well designed though. The game also scaled to 2 players much better than I expect from a euro, which is a really important feature for me. Many games of this style are only really good with 3 or 4 players, but I do a lot of 2 player gaming, and my partner enjoys this style of euro game.

Update: I'm seriously impressed with how much replay value is packed into this game, and I haven't even tried it with more than 2 players or without the preselected setup. There are many different strategies to try.

Update: After one play with 4 players, it also played great at this player count.  Scalability is quite good!

This is a cool little underrated game and there's nothing else out there quite like it.  The strategy is very subtle and indirect - just like the moon.   The theme is unique and the mechanics blend right in, which is very important to my enjoyment of any game.  The rules are simple, tight, and elegant - I wouldn't expect anything less from designer Stefan Feld.

Gets bonus points for including a really clever and "thinky" solo mode.  Also gets bonus points for having 3 different solo play levels that really up the challenge!

Gets even more bonus points for having one of the most beautiful "modular" boards ever!

I need to play this more.

RATING: 7
Pretty solid variation on the worker-placement genre.  Here, it's worker removal to trigger actions, and it often has to be done in pairs.   There are 4 main ways to get points, and most of them are 2- and 3-step processes.   Since you have 14 action choices, there's a lot to think about at first, but once you get the hang of it, the turns zoom by since they are very short micro-actions essentially.  I liken it to Notre Dame but having all the cards, all the time. The lunar priestess theme is a bit weird, and I think we are seeing designers a bit desperate for something different.  It's a pretty mechanical game but it's interesting enough and engaging enough to work.   As with all Feld games, it seems, there is damage mitigation as the Apostate wanders around bringing losses to your points pile.   The player aid is very well done - the whole game is right there.

I'm over the moon that TMG reprinted this.  Maybe Feld's oddest game but, like everything else he does, it works like a finely tuned watch.  This feels familiar but is unlike anything else in my collection (aside from the marketplace mechanics that La Granja borrowed from Luna's temple back when this was still OOP).  Difficult choices abound. Heavy but easy to wrap your brain around after one round.  Lovely theme and artwork.  It was awesome to get a "new" Feld game in a year without any new Feld games.

RATING: 5
Luna is a game of worker placement, action selection, timing, and a hint of area majority.  Using the workers has a variety of functions such as: making new actions available, augmenting always available actions, increasing area majority tiebreaker standings which also give you points, avoiding negative points while possibly also trying to inflict them on others, creating more workers, moving your workers, and a variety of other things.  The graphic design/artwork is nice and there is no hidden information or cards.  The tempo of the game from round to round is in the hand of the players.

While this all sounds good and interesting, I didn't really enjoy the game.  As I've only played one game and at what I would probably consider to be the worst player count (3) I'm probably not the best one to judge the game.  Here is what I didn't like about it: I didn't like the two types of targeted player attacks.  There are 7 islands and a character that will cause negative points to all players that have workers on that island.  You can use worker actions to move this character.  You can protect yourself against this targeted attack by having available workers to move the character again, but it wasn't something I enjoyed having to keep in mind.

The second type of targeted attacks come from the temple.  Workers in the temple provide points from round-to-round.  When new workers are added to the temple, they can potentially kick out opposing players workers.  Not only does this gain you points per round, but you also stop opponents from gaining points per round, you gain an immediate point per worker kicked out, and essentially create a situation where opponents need to use special actions to use the workers again otherwise they'll be sitting on wasted potential.  Protection from being kicked is available through special actions and careful planning.  Overall, I can say that this was a big turnoff for me as in a 3 player game someone can be hit by these attacks from both opponents which can essentially put a player completely out of the running.  Full disclosure: that was me in my game played.

This is essentially a euro in that you are optimizing the use of your workers and actions to try and get the most points.  I didn't really like the type of player interaction involved for a game of this type.  I don't mind this type of interaction for the area control type of euro games but that's not the type that Luna is despite having a small amount of area majority included within it.  If you ever wished that you could destroy your opponents fences or kill opponents livestock in Agricola, Luna may be the kind of game you're looking for.

Played like how I imagined a Feld worker placement game would go down. Negative incentives, a significant limit to the number of actions you can do versus the number of actions you want to do, and general quirkiness. It plays fast and the dynamics of the rounds is interesting. I think the replay ability of the island set up may have been a little overstated by some. It provides some variance, sure, but the amount this really changes the game is questionable.

Surprisingly, the game is fairly easy to learn despite the umpteen actions available on a player's turn. I'm usually not a fan of Feld games but here he gives us lots of levers to pull without penalizing us too harshly. The experience is one of efficiency planning and event anticipation. Quite a bit of forward planning is required as things move around the islands while you maneuver to grab key spots on the main island.

A cute and clever worker placement game that requires the manipulating the location, the "islands", of the workers once they have been been placed.

Rating based on one play. The game flows well, and it is easy to understand the game already in the middle of the first round. The fact that you have "tons" of actions to choose between every turn was surprisingly not a "time consumer", but felt fresh and also natural. I missed some more interaction in the game. This is not the best Feld game, and not a "must have", but a good and unique game, both thematically and mechanically.

Luna is a complex strategy game with many ways to make points and many hard decisions; planning ahead for the next round is important.  Therefore  those immobilized with analysis paralysis can make this game deadly.

I found myself making mistakes because it took so long to get back to me I had forgotten the important order of my many actions--doing actions out of your planned order can be very unforgiving.  Next time I think I will write down my actions and their order down so I don't forget--then I can also buzz right through them.  I think it would speed up the game, and I wish everyone would do it--also would encourage players to start planning their moves before their turn.

With 14 actions I thought the rules would be complicated, and even though the actions do intertwine and combine, they fell easily into use.  

The seven surrounding islands offer favors (gained with novices) which help the novices move, gain more actions, collect/lose Influence Points, and promote novices to the temple, the center of the game, where they are often removed by opponents. 

Actions are implemented one at a time in player order and usually cost novices and/or favors.  Since building chapels frees up some novices for additional actions, near the end of the game it can be hard to get all your actions in before someone decides to end the round early to ruin plans. Your opponent may have many of his novices and you might think you are safe, but there are some actions that can use all his novices at once.

Repositioning is inefficient but necessary.  

I am lukewarm on the theme and graphics.  I want to play again soon because I am intrigued by some possible strategies I don't want to forget to try, but in the long run, I don't know.  Probably not. 

A really nice puzzle board and absolutely solid when fitted together.  Lots of components and somewhat fiddly to set up.

This game looks the part.  It is beautifully illustrated and has a wonderful assortment of components.  

Gameplay is a type of reverse worker placement (displacement).  By this i mean workers (in this case Novices) are moved off Islands to perform an action.  It is possible to re-activate these Novices and use them multiple times, either on the same island or another.  

There are a variety of scoring mechanisms which take effect either at the end of each of six rounds or at the game end.  Points are won per round for majorities on the Moon Priestess Island, entering the temple (and displacing other novices) and points are lost for remaining on the Island with the Apostate.
At the game end points can be won for each Shrine built in addition to the player's position within the council.

Overall I really like this game.  It could be argued that the theme is irrelavent and the game is basically the mechanic, but it takes nothing away for me personally.

Essen 2010:one of the above-average games I played there. Wanna try again.

rating update from 7: great strategic game with tons of choices to consider (with a little downside that mistakes are not really forgiving). Best Feld so far in my view. Potential to rise to 9

Rated 9 after about 12 games: Mr. Feld, you did it (again, after "Year of the Dragon" and your upcoming next masterpiece "Burgen von Burgund")

Nagyon egyedi, mégis nagyon egyberakott játék. Sima munkáslehelyezősnek tűnik elsőre, de rengeteg az interakció, és nagyon egyediek az akciók. A grafika is tetszik nekem. 

Ami tetszett:
- egyedi megoldások
- szép grafika
- komoly interakció

Ami nem tetszett:
- a táblát nem lehet teljesen öszerakni mert szorul
- a táblán és a tokenek lévő színek gyakorlatilag megkülönböztethetetlenek. 
- a figurák léptetésének szabálya valahogy teljesen értelmetlenül van leírva, kitalálva.

Így elsőre 8, aztán majd meglátjuk. :)

In Luna you must efficiently employ your apprentices to garner favours with the Moon Priestess. As often happens with no-luck optimization games that may make certain players take very long. Despite the large number of choices available on your turn, each single action is very simple and quick - provided you can decide on one.

Mechanics-wise the game is an amalgamation of various elements, without weighing much in one direction or another: a little worker placement here, area majority there, and all of them offer ways to score with the Priestess.

Luna is an interesting bag of tricks that rewards forward planning and, while it is fairly abstract as is usual for Feld's games, lacks his typical hardship component.

Der Mond ist aufgegangen, die goldnen Sternlein prangen am Himmel hell und klar. Der Wald steht schwarz und schweigen und aus den Wiesen steiget der weiße Nebel wunderbar. Wie ist die Welt so stille und in der Dämmerung Hülle, so traulich und so hold, als eine stille Kammer, wo ihr des Tages Jammer verschlafen und vergessen sollt. Seht ihr den Mond dort stehen?

I'd like to see this idea of worker specialization (placing your workers on a spot and leaving them there for a reasonable period) used elsewhere, in a game with more strategy.

RATING: 8.77
I had tried to learn this game by reading the rules and playing on yucata, and failed miserably.

This is not a typical point salad / worker placement game - it is quite different, even from other Feld's designs. Its intrincated mechanisms are not very intuitive, so it seems to be more complex than it really is. I strongly recommend to get someone who already know the rules to teach it.

After one play, it "clicked" me and imediately got added to my wishlist. Awesome game!

Luna really surprised me.  I'm always worried about saturating my collection with worker placement games, but Luna holds a worthy place. It isn't revolutionary, but Feld manages to use this mechanic in a fresh way. Every part of this game feels integrated and you are progressively able to see the relationships of actions that might not seem connected at first.  This game benefits from strategical thinking, but you might end up making tactical moves based on what your opponents do. Feld made a daring move by making the title character a woman as I don't think that gets a lot of geeks interested in this game. I appreciate that Feld didn't stick a "17th century trading game in Europe" blah theme on it just like the majority of games like this have. You are constantly thinking in this game. People will even forget it's their turn because they are constantly analyzing the board.  However, AP amazingly stays minimal due to the progressive limits that are placed on your options. A tough game to digest at first, however, Luna is a beautiful game and a top-notch experience.

Very clever game of intermeshing mechanics leading to brain strain as you try to think forward in the right order the train of actions you need to achieve something, while trying to combat what the others are doing.  It took a while to get to the table because of the theme (moon priestesses - why?) but was certainly enjoyed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Points salad, but there is some player interaction as opponents crowd isles to score depending on where the Priestess has moved. The theme ~sort of~ works, the isles feel distinct, and the movement of the 3 major characters is an interestig aspect (essentially limiting areas of scoring/punishment/building.) 

There are a lot of oddball addendums to rules, and a LOT of initial options to start, which makes the game feel overwhelming at first. As turns progress however, the open spots get cramped and the game flows much better. Most of the time while I'm playing this, I'm thinking there are a ton of other 'worker placement' games that just do it better. This is zany points engine for the sake of zany points engine. Meh.

Nice looking components though!

This game is awesome once you're familiar with all the actions you can take.  The only thing that worries me is if it's possible to memorize a pattern for winning every game with the pre-set setup.  Luckily, should that situation arise, it's perfectly reasonable to make the setup a little more random to keep it fresh.

I haven't tried them all but Luna is by far my favorite Feld and, more generally, one of my favorite games. It's just so odd! The theme, the game layout, the mechanisms. I was worried after my initial play that I was just taken by its weirdness and it'd pass but Luna is definitely a keeper. 

PROS
-A ton of actions. Every turn you can do something new. In fact, you could almost do something new every round if you really wanted to.
-Following the Priestess and avoiding--or better yet, manipulating--the Apostate. These make for interesting decisions, especially when you're trying to consider just how your opponent wants to screw you.
-The passing mechanism also makes you think if you can really pull off what you want to do before the round ends. 
-Promotion, the Temple area, and the Books of Wisdom are another little chess match within a chess match and can change quit a bit over the course of the game.
-That balance of when to hold guys to do actions and when to commit guys to the Temple for points.

The gameplay in Luna is simply fantastic in my book and I really want to play more.

Subtle but disjointed game that lacks focus and a sense of accomplishment. I can see that there is some good meat to this game, but I just don't think it's the game for me. I find that I just don't really care about what's happening in the game.

I have been willing to learn Luna for a while, but I had really hard reading the rule book. The game just seemed too hard to wrap the head around without setting up the components. In accordance to other Feld games this is a quite tactical game where position and timing plays a great role. At first I found it quite confusing with all the tokens in the game, but once you play a turn or two things are starting to get clearer. I found the game to be quite challenging as it felt like a struggle to be at the right spot at the right time with the right amount of novices and I found it rewarding when I got it right.

Wow this is a blast i love the theme and the atmosphere the game presents.The system is clean and strong and very much has Feld's style dripping all over it. The game plays quickly and smooth with each turn flowing into the next seamlessly. The rule set may appear to be overwhelming but after the first few turns you should have a strong grasp as to what you want to achieve. With a myriad of scoring avenues but in a way far more stream lined scoring compared to Feld's more renowned-ed titles like Trajan and Castles of Burgandy.
This may have flown under the radar but i would recommend you grab it if you find it for a good price , you wont be disappointed.

It feels very mechanical (I did not felt much of the theme). And it is prone to A/P as you really have to optimizie very turn sequence of yours. It wasn't a bad experience but it more felt like to work a game instead of playing a game and having fun. Maybe it needs a second play (therefore this is a preliminary rating after one game).
edit: after second play I rose my rating as the game went smoother, so yes it has a learning curve.

This is a game of many parts that are interrelated, but not convincingly integrated.  I liked the island travel and actions.  I found the actions on the main island to be fussy and detracting.  Not for those with AP.  It looks like an engine-building game, but I think it might be a more tactical - 'chase the points' game.

With 2, the temple placement mechanic just felt too simple, which may be what dooms this game.

That aside, I didn't enjoy the rest of the mechanics either; the tide action (aka "plan your whole next round right now") felt sprawling and loose while the rest felt too locked down. I wonder what I'm missing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Lovely game with a slow, deliberate pace. You place your workers on 1 of 7 islands to gain some benefit from that island. In the center of the ring of 7 islands is the temple where try to occupy a spot and not be displaced. The game plays very slowly, you must plan ever move in advance as there's no way to shortcut anything. It makes for a game with a very slow build-up, one where you feel your hands are tied every step of the way. This slow, deliberate, almost meditative atmosphere is complemented by an unusual board that makes it hard to think in linear terms: things happen clockwise and counterclockwise. This is one of the best games I've seen where the gameplay, mechanics, and theme all intermix perfectly. That said, it made for a bit of a boring night, with only the final 2 rounds of 6 being mildly tense. I'll play it again, however.

RATING: 8
Initial rating after one wonderful play which I tragically lost :-)  Luna is an elegant game of worker placement and resource collection.  What I really like is that the action of each worker is instantly resolved, making the order in which you use your workers crucial.  Furthermore I like the way the workers need to be moved between the differnt islands, making it neccessary to plan at least one turn ahead.  The excellent rule book, along with the player reference card and the beautiful design complete the very good impression.  This will definitely hit the table more often! 

Update after more games: Keeping my rating of "8".  
Very good game!

I tend to enjoy games that give players wide latitude in terms of decision making and creativity.  That is why I am attracted to games that give players “action points” that they can use to perform a variety of different actions.  Games such as Tikal, Torres and Java are personal favorites.  They always play out differently, and there are usually multiple times during the course of a game where one or more players make extremely clever and dramatic moves.  I always derive a sense of satisfaction when accomplishing such a feat.  

Luna is one of those games.  While not using action points per se, players can choose from a wide variety of actions and are free to combine them in clever manners in attempts to achieve their objectives.  The game is extremely open-ended and doesn’t follow a scripted path that far too many games employ.  Yes, the theme is nothing short of bizarre, but I have been able to overlook that due to the continual opportunities for clever maneuvers and action combinations.

This game is certainly very well and intricately designed and balanced, but suffers a bit from having too much of everything.

Extremely well balanced, with a straightforward ruleset an an apparently huge number of strategies and agonizing choices.  Nice too look at, too.
Mix opportunistic tactical moves and long term planing to grab the few extra points you'll need for the win!
This game also an interesting solo mode, and is interesting with 2, 3 or 4 players; imo it's better with 3, because as usual the chaos does increase with the number of players - with 2 it's a contest of wits, while with four you'll have to outguess your opponents.
The playing time is 20 minutes per player; one player games last 30 minutes.

RATING: 7
Luna is a Feld game that is dripping with theme, it has Klemens Franz artwork and an interesting, even unique style of board, which is also variable setup to add reapeat playability. In short it is missing nothing to make it a real favorite- but somehow the point salad tastes a little blander to me here than many less thematic Feld games.

Each player has a number of acolytes, and making them work by jumping off their island can build a shrine, or claim a bonus tile for special actions, or launch an acolyte to the main temple island to claim a tile matching the island from which they came.

Or they can stick around the outer 7 islands, and try to gain a majority on the island with Luna, the Chief Priestess, or push the Apostate about to an inconvenient location for another player.

Acolytes can also move into the Main Temple once they have claimed an approved tile, or bribe the guard to sneak a little past him or even move the unapproved tile into the Temple itself.

Inside the temple, landing on a higher number tile next to an acolyte without a Prayer Book means they are catapulted back out of the temple to the landing- but if they have a prayer book or are on a higher number tile means they are safe. Acolytes inside the Temple can steal other Acolyte's prayer books (this earns a point and protects them); ejecting other acolytes also earns points.

The theme is painted pretty thinly in other words, despite the art, and the board, and the storyline.

Something about it does not ring very true, and while Luna can still be a tight game of area control/worker placement, it somehow screams 'EURO', and that makes it fall a little flat for me.

I still rate this a 7, because the game mechanics are decent, but I think its never gonna be my favorite Feld to pull out and enjoy.

No matter how tasty the theme sauce, this one leaves an aftertaste of cardboard and wood in my mouth.

RATING: 9
This one is going to take some time to digest. I could see it becoming a favorite if enough opportunities to play arise. There is so much to think about in what appears on the surface to be pretty simple. It's surprisingly overwhelming with a lot of "why didn't I notice that" type moments. Scoring opportunities are plenty even with the constrained gameplay, so you really have to base your decisions on potential net gains and losses. I prefer games like this with scoring tracks, but I have yet to decide if I'd like that better (scoring isn't hidden in this game really, but you can't necessarily count up opponents' points all the time either).

(04/08/11) On my first and only play of Luna, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing. There are three different mini-games going on, all coupled to each other. It is clearly a Euro that seems to be trying to be something more with seemingly clever mechanisms, simply for the sake of tacking on more mechanism. At no point in the did I ever identify with the theme: Why do I care? What is my motivation? In that regard it was more frustrating than enjoyable. Perhaps there is a game in here worth pursuing, but it just doesn't click with me. I rate it a '5'.

Update (12/09/12): I didn't know who Stefan Feld was back then; I know now. Having played some of his designs: Notre Dame, Luna, and Castles of Burgundy, I see that he is good at coming up with complex, innovative game mechanisms. I struggle to see if he develops these mechanisms for the sake of game mechanisms, or if it is an attempt at trying to convey a theme. Martin Wallace is good at the latter, but Feld is almost convincingly the former. Is that a good thing or bad thing? It depends on the gamer. I'm sort of turned off by it.

Update (10/29/2013): A quote from Scott Nicholson's Blog: [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/772/luna-doing-random-things-for-points]"Luna - Doing random things for points"[/url] (emphasis mine)

[i]... There are a bunch of random things you do to score points in different ways. There's nothing that holds all of these things together. It just feels like we are sitting around pushing pieces at each other.

Luna represents the sort of eurogame I've grown very tired of - a lightly themed abstract where the actions players take just don't make any sense. It's not that it's unbalanced... it's just I don't find myself being involved with what I'm doing. [b]I just don't care[/b], and this makes me mentally detached from the game and from the other players.[/i]

My thoughts exactly.

I like the no-luck aspect of it during game play (well, at least in theory, after one play hard to say whether I like it in practice). But this is a type of Euro that I increasingly find hard to enjoy. It has an explosion of moving parts and choices. I feel like the "depth" of the game isn't really intrinsic but rather mere window dressing caused by obscuring the engine underneath these choices.

Now this somewhat unfair because I've only played Luna once and I'm tarring it with a generalisation that may not be accurate for this particular game. So caveat comment reader.

It doesn't help that my main Euro gaming is done with "game tourists" so I'm unlikely to play this enough to ever find out one way or another. That "game tourism" means I'm coming to prefer games with simpler mechanics so that I can focus more on my strategy rather than merely understanding the Victory Point Conveyer Belt.

The game is a bit intimidating the first time you play; it's a big puzzle of "I need to do XX before YY so I can do ZZ." After you wrap your head around the different actions available to you (summarized on a handy player aid), the game like a puzzle.

A lot of the point scoring is having your guys stand around in the inner temple. However, placing on a bigger number kicks off anyone on an adjacent smaller number if they are not sitting on a book. This creates this waiting game on when to enter the temple to minimize getting booted out.

There is the option to steal books from people (that's what protects a meeple from being kicked out of the temple), but from the games I've played, if someone steals a book, then that person has seen it coming (why else did you take that book token?) and will steal the book right back.

An oddball action picking game (how could you theme something around jumping into the sea?!) that comes across as much lighter than Stefan Feld's usual fare. There's the usual mechanism for creating a penalty that you have to minimise in the dark wizard, but staying away from him isn't too difficult. I'm less impressed by the targetted player attacks in the book stealing and expulsion of novices from the 'temple' mechanism, individual attacks are always a frustratingly weak feature in a multi-player game. No matter which strategy you pursue the scoring is tight at the end, so winning is a matter of making use of just a handful of extra scoring opportunities.

I had a lot of trouble getting a good grasp of what this game is all about in the first play. The players are presented with a long list of options and all of them are available from the beginning of the game, so it is not at all clear where to start.   As it turns out, there are long-term and short-term ways of scoring points and protecting the points you have.  The game is quite difficult to describe, but it's highly unusual, and I would be happy to get to know it better. (1 play)

This game impressed me much more than I thought it would.  Luna is very mechanical and dry, but its design is solid.  Actions are very limited and gameplay is tense as you can never do everything you want to.  I like that you have to simultaneously manage your current turn and also plan out your next turn as well.

Wow! I love the range of actions on offer every turn and how you often have to use muliple turns to complete a final move. 

The ability to wind a round down by using all available actions or putting early pressure on your opponent/s by turning the candles is a nice idea. 

The gameplay is luck-free, which is something new for us, so strategic planning goes a long way in this game. 
My wife usually likes a bit of randomness thrown into the mix so she doesn't have to concentrate so much. (She's a great gaming spouse, but not the one with the gaming addiction.) :whistle:

But after two plays in two days, she's ready for round three after getting the hang of strategic planning in our second game, which made it much closer at the end. I think she'll pip me for the win in round three if I'm not careful.

The game itself is great to look at when set up on the table. We don't mind the theme at all. Seems a nice fit for most of the mechanics.

Update: I called it. My wife won our third play after a tie break in the council. :laugh:

Really need to give this one some more tries.  It seems to be quite evocative given the complete lack of random input after the game begins.  And even the player chaos isn't that large.  Quite the accomplishment!

Planning out your turns is quite enjoyable.  Downtime isn't too bad with each action being fairly swift.

The variety of actions keeps the possibilities open.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

This was our first introduction to Stefan Feld and I couldn't imagine a better place to start. This is the most strategic worker placement game I have ever come across. You use your workers for a variety of purposes; such as area control, action tile acquisition and raw points, while being very conscious of your partner's choices and your remaining turns. I've often found that getting all of your workers into the game can work against you later on as your partner forces the round's end prematurely. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- A very unique theme with delightful artwork. The board design is great fun and adds a lot to the experience.
- Plays in well under an hour once you're familiar with the basic strategies.
- Makes you plan a few moves ahead and is very satisfying what it all comes together. 
- Worker placement is often a dry affair, but the variety of actions open to each worker at any given moment makes Luna quite special. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Can be quite confrontational for a Euro. Some of the strategies are actually quite mean-spirited, contrary to the theme.

Worker placement, but done differently.  As typical with Feld, low player interaction, but this does give you the ability to work your own strategy.  Very strange mechanism where the workers return to their island at the start of the next round.  You have to plan ahead, since they don't move automatically.  A fair bit of fiddliness, but not too bad

Juegazo made in Feld, más desconocido que otros títulos suyos, seguramente porque hasta hace poco no se encontraba a buen precio. Mecánica de colocación de trabajadores (o mas bien de movimiento) por las distintas islas que componen el juego y una isla central que es un minijuego en si mismo. Mucha interacción entre los jugadores y multitud de opciones y formas de ganar. 

Lo peor el setup y que hasta que te enteras de todo lo que puedes hacer vas completamente perdido. No es un juego para todo el mundo, requiere algo de experiencia para tener claro como programar nuestras acciones de cara a turnos posteriores.

RATING: 5
Classic euro mixing tactical and strategic level.  Distinct strategies might exist or not (I've played only twice and have mixed thoughts about this).

I don't mind, let's say controversial, theme or 14 types of actions selectable by players.  The ruleset is logical, intuitive and easy to explain, grasp and follow.

My problem is that the excitement from the game is greatly diminished by loong turns.  4 passes are required to finish the round and that might take ages when experienced gamers will be reviving and moving novices and gaining favour tokens and reveiving and moving novices over and over again...

Replayability is probably an issue too.  After the second game I feel I've seen enough and I've played enough.  Specialization and distinct strategies might've been an illusion created by my first game.

All in all, not a bad game, but it didn't charm me and even if these loong turns hadn't existed, I wouldn't have bought it.  Longs turns only stop me from playing it in the imaginable future.  There are so many games I'd play over this.

RATING: 8
Excellent game, very gamey overall.  No luck, a little player chaos from the heathly amount of dirt here, Feld took a page right out of a  Kramer book!  I was a little worried at first about this 'dirt' but I think the level is okay in the end.  Fairly unique overall and a decent attempt at theme which might be a tad odd but it mostly works and at least it too is unique and isn’t trading in Italy or the like.  It is a little on the dry side but not as much as Hansa Teutonica and on par with most Euros.    

So many nifty options here, I love a game that gives you lots of options and ALL of them are good, every Island you can visit has something good to offer (and you need and want them all) as does the mainland which is strictly points.  Speaking of points, several ways to score which was great and several ways to skin the cat also awesome.  Tons of options yes but in my first game I did NOT even look at the player aid, after the first round or two everything just clicks and you are left with just the often tough decisions to think about.  Seems to be a good balance of strategy and tactics here and the game seems to scale excellent (best with 4?) and plays in a good time frame too.  

I’m not sure on the replay, every game will play a little differently for sure so np there especially depending on number of players but the amount to explore might be a tad low (many ways to play but they are more obvious than say ITYOTD), I’d give it 5 to 10 games which is still good before I likely get a little bored (most games I get bored 1 to 5, rare really good ones make it to 20 for me). 

So replay might be just a tad suspect only for the one reason mentioned, in every other way it will be good however including as I mentioned multiple ways to play.  This and the dirt factor are the only possible negatives and they are quite small IMO and only questionable (I only mention them as 'potential' for some people), everything else are big positives so great game overall that should appeal to Euro low luck 'gamers'.

Really fun game. You have to have your guys on very specific islands most of the time and so you have to really be careful how and when you use them and in particular where they end up at the end of a round. Each island has a different bonus tile and using those effectively is really important, and can mean the difference between doing nothing and having a really strong turn. But you have to be really careful, since the way a round ends is if there are a total of four pass actions taken between all of the players. So if everyone else sees you gearing up for a big round, they can just all pass and you don't get to do what you wanted, and maybe you don't even get to use all of your guys. Alternatively if you're in a position where you don't have a lot to do in a turn, you can really put the screws to everyone else. It's a really interesting dynamic. There is a decent amount of potential for comboing actions together, but the nice thing about this is how you have to work for it and you feel clever for making it all work out.

Update: it's lost a small amount of its shine for me, in that it's beginning to feel like the interesting strategic plans and multi-turn combos you can build can so easily be shut down by opponents. The passing mechanic is such a central part of the game. I think for a while I was just assuming that there was some next level I could get to where I could plan out and combo so much better, but really the second you get something too good going everyone else gangs up to end the round. Still a lot of interesting stuff and fun to play, but not quite as open to clever play as I once thought. Note, no change to rating, just goes from high/middle of the 8.5s to bottom of the 8.5s).

Initial Rating: 7.5 (April 2011)

Lately, I have become a Feld fan, no doubt about that. When I first played Luna I didn’t knew the designer, but still I liked the game, however with more plays I found that there was a dominant strategy, in fact as today, I have played 10 Luna games and I believe I have won them all. I hope to be mistaken ( I have played with new players a lot of times after all) and I still have not played with the advanced setup.

The rules are nor particularly hard, but there are a lot of them making this hard to explain. The game take around 2 hours (or more with AP players), the game lends itself to overthinking. I really like the low luck involved with the game but it is hard to find joy playing Luna, what I mean, is that the game is kind of boring.

The theme doesn’t bother me, but I don’t like it either. The game components and art are ok.

For now, I plan to play this a lot more in the near future, too see if there is a dominant strategy. My favorite Felds as of today are Castles of Burgundy, Bora Bora, Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon)

I'm not really sure what I think about Luna yet.  It's daunting to learn but easy to play.  There exist many different efficiencies.  I'm sure we were underusing certain actions, like gold and books, in our first play.  Still, shrines, herbs, novices, boats, and tides all seem stronger.

Good tension between early point taking and the traditional Euro infrastructure buildup into late points juggernaut.

Needs a couple more plays preferably with non-standard setups.

RATING: 8.5
This is a very funky game, and when I read the rules I remained in a cloud as to what the design intent was.

In play - that funkiness translates to originality, both in its mechanics and in the sort of analysis you need to perform to play this.  You are selecting from several types of actions to perform for the purpose of building shrines (extra power and points), placing meeples in the scoring section of the board (for points), and fighting a majority battle with meeples on any given island, which changes each turn.  So far, no problem.

However, what drives the game is the restrictions on how you get to choose your actions.  Your meeples need to be in the right place, and finding ways to move them to the right place at the right time consumes as much of your strategy as do the scoring considerations.  It is all agonizing.

Complicating things is the fact that the end of each round is variable.  As opponents run out of things to do, they cause the clock to tick down.  If only one opponent is exhausted of opportunities you'll have several more turns, but then suddenly others become exhausted and the clock flips rapidly, preventing you from executing your grand plan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players are priests/priestesses praying to the moon godess for favours. Lots of available actions are confusing at first but each single action is simple and short enough that the game gets a flow once players got them down. Still enough opportunity for AP though but some turns will be very fast. Normally, I'm an attentive player but never before in a game I missed so often that it's my turn. 
Luna is a clever mix of known elements that combined form a unique new game. There's a slight engine building element in the construction of temples which I doubt that it can be ignored to win the game but is not too dominant to annoy me. An area majority element is introduced with the scoring for the moon godesses island that might be ignored sometimes if there are better scoring opportunities. Positional play is necessary in promoting novices to the temple at the right time. The tradeoff here between scoring more points early while limiting the future action potential at the same time is balanced enough to create real alternative. What probably differentiates it the most from the mass of Euros is the lack of resource-to-VP conversion.
I enjoyed my first play. Luna offers enough to explore and feels unique enough that I might add it to my collection in mid-term.

My expectations were very low for this game, mainly because of mediocre buzz thus far.  The theme is ridiculous, completely pasted on and almost nonsensical.  It's kind of funny to read the flavor text in the rulebook, imagining how hard they tried to make the mechanisms fit the theme.  So what exactly are we trying to do?  Aid the moon princess?  I would say that the theme definitely detracts from the enjoyment of the game.  It would be better if you were racing around town, trying to pick up the right items to be let into some special event.

But anyway, the game is actually kind of fun.  You will read a lot of comments regarding the overwhelming number of options.  While there is an initial learning curve, once you figure them out, the game play is actually very simple, since all you ever do is one action and there is very little administrative work or multiple phases to work out.

I like the amount of planning you can do, though I would be hesitant to play it with players subject to AP problems.

RATING: 5.5
Tough one to rate. There's just so many things going on. The game rewards planning, but my main problem with it is that its unintuitive. Bringing people into the temple? What for? What do they do? Nothing... its just a mechanism to kick other people out. Book of Wisdom stops you from kicking them out? Umm... ok...

Its really hard to understand the flow of the game. You can undoubtedly chain up clever moves to gain VPs, but it just feels like moves, it never really feels like anything "thematic".

Looks like a family game, but is far from being one. Fourteen different actions and a huge amount of differing things you can make on your turn make it seem a way more complicated at first than it really is. Add to this the  ever differing setup and you'll never have Luna playing the same way twice. Despite of the vast amount of possibilities everything works well and combines well with everything else.

This game disappointed me.  The theme was thin.  The strategy didn't feel that deep either.  I didn't really feel like the game builds as you go.  Each round feels like I'm doing the exact same things I did the round before.  New choices don't come out on new rounds expect for a few new spaces to get into the temple.

Én úgy érzem, hogy nagyon egyedi játék a Luna. Nem nagyon tudnám semmihez sem hasonlítani. Persze biztosan lehetne elemezgetni, hogy melyik mechanikával hol találkozhattunk már, de nem lenne értelme.
Az egyedisége mellett viszont nagyon nehezen áll össze az egész. Pedig nem túl bonyolultak a szabályok, mégis nem az a pár kör alatt belerázódós játék. Mondanám, hogy több játék alatt biztosan kevésbé lenne döcögős az egész, de valami miatt úgy érzem, hogy nem muszáj túl sokat játszanom vele.
Pedig jó játéknak tartom, csak valahogy nem az én ízlésemnek való. Mondjuk ettől függetlenül nem mondanék nemet, ha mások nagyon erre vágynának.

One of the better area control games I've played. Not sure what I like about this one so much, possibly the fact that it is much more euro'y than most area control games and the area control aspect jumps around the board as to what is actually important. Very cool with the different islands. Solid Feld.

RATING: 9
As much of a puzzle in nature as a game, this no-luck game really shines. My favorite from Feld so far. He really has created something unique in terms of worker placement with the use of the different islands and the plethora of options available. 

New players will likely be a bit overwhelmed at all of the different possibilities, but after one play, should be able to put together a coherent strategy. Reverse engineering goals can be helpful as the game is really about efficient and effective use of an unknown number of turns each round. Players could create infinite loops of actions in theory, but they will likely (a) run out of time to do what they want each round and (b) may not be scoring any points. Shrines have obvious benefits in terms of end game points and bump in action efficiency, but are not the sole focus point. Points from early placement in the temple can be significant, especially if the workers are able to remain there for an extra round or two. Also, the counsel of priests can certainly come into play for both ties for Luna’s affection and end game points. 

As for usefulness of tiles, despite the changing strengths of many depending on the particular situation, I think the Bribery & Book of Wisdom are the two weakest. As such I tend to avoid building Shrine on those Islands unless I see an easy opportunity for temple placement.

Game plays well with both 3 & 4 players (have not tried it with 2) although it can run a little long with 4. AP could be an issue for some, but turns are generally very quick so it should not be too bad in most cases.

The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the "worker movement" principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services. But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.

A solid Feld game with lots to juggle and an endless tug of wars between conflicting priorities.  The main mechanic (meeple island management) is ultimately rather complex and involve a fair bit of management to be leveraged optimally.  The game is extremely balanced, to the point that scores are so close that winning sometimes feels like a toss-up.  Articulating a real strategy can sometimes be difficult/detrimental because of the importance of seizing opportunities and adapting to opponents actions.  Not my favorite from the designer but a solid game nevertheless.

LIKES:

* Used worker placement slightly differently in that you had to often use workers in pairs to complete an action unless you also had a temple present on the building in which case you could just use one.
* Fourteen or so actions from which to choose to take on your turn depending on where your workers were located.
* Several different characters would move around the islands either granting points, subtracting points, or giving one the possibility of building a temple.
* The interaction and scoring for the tiles on the main board was interesting and also acted as the game end condition.
* Plans sometimes will run out of time as players can choose to pass and after four torches are turned over, the round is over.

DISLIKE:
* First round or two can be really confusing/overwhelming with so many action choices!  
* Set-up time is a bit long / fiddly.

Na ezt egy játék alapján nem lehet megítélni. Elsőre elveszik az ember a sok lehetőség között, fogalma sincs, hogy mit és hogyan lenne érdemes, egyszerűen kell hozzá 2-3 játék, mire belejön valaki.

Mindenesetre úgy érzem, ez az a játék, amiben MINDEN megvan, hogy tökéletes legyen. Na jó, nem könnyen tanulható, nem könnyen kiismerhető, és szerintem nem is elég szép a szemnek.

Very interesting game that feels different from other Feld designs but also shares certain characteristics like different mechanisms for earning points competing for the players' limited attention and resources each round.  Tried to learn this unsuccessfully online on Yucata but it is rather straightforward face to face.  I particularly like the way movement is handled through three different mechanics.

The game needs to be played a few times: there are many different actions that can be done in a turn (15!). 

It is nice to be able to influence the turn tempo. 

Fast and fluid enough.

A demanding game: the number if actions is large and they combine in non-obvious plays. It's a bit easy to complexify a game like this. 

The rules contain many easy points but in a string of rules that's quite long. This part is not so elegant. 

37 minutes per player. That's nice, with two players.

This game is a Feld masterpiece.  There is virtually no luck involved in this game whatsoever.  I'm not even sure what the theme is or what the game is about, but I don't care!  I have to be in the right mood to play this game, because, since there is nothing left to chance, you have to bring your "A" game every time...especially when you play against my husband!

This is an amazing game for the right players, but I'm not one of them. When I first got into board gaming this became my Holy Grail game because of the theme and it looked impressive ( had no idea what I enjoyed in games at that point). It turned out to be too heavy, too long and too dry for my tastes, and the mechanics didn't fit the theme.

Some games are fun when you have too many choices and not enough actions.  However, Luna suffers from this feature.  You do have too many choices and not enough actions, but it also takes multiple actions to convert into an actual result.  The board presentation is neat, and certainly easily leads itself to various setups.  But playing the game feels like too much work for too little of a result.

An interesting Stephan Feld game where you are traveling to different islands to gain special abilities.  You are building temples, scoring points by having the most workers on an island with the Wizard.  There is an island where you are penalized if you have presence with a priest.  In general, a medium weight game that plays in under 90 minutes.  

Very fun game.

RATING: 9
Good game from Feld where about all information is open and basically no luck involved. The theme where players are striving to become the next Moon Priestes is new and as worked in as you get in an abstract Eurogame. 

It is a worker placement game where players compete for influense points (VP) and also an area controll part within the temple. As a twist there is not a fixed amount of actions per round but decided by the gameclock which takes actions to controll. 

Even though the game can seem a bit dry from this description it is not, there are lots of things going on at the same time, different strategies for victory and lots of tactics for getting influense points and balansing different strategies towards an optimal output. Rules are easy and quite clear (almost to compressed) good flow with quick turns in the game and very high replayability. The only drawback is that you need to plan a bit ahead but also respond to what your oponents do so for AP-prone players there is a risk for temporary freezdowns during parts of the game. 

Good brain-workout and fun.

RATING: 8
While most Stefan Feld games have a small amount of luck involved, Luna is completely luck-free. However, it is still difficult to plan and execute a perfect strategy; each round ends after a number of players passes, so you frequently have to decide between trying for a combination of moves that will score highly but take a lot of turns, or whether to make some small moves and consolidate your choices for the next round.

The theme is a bit kooky, with players cast as monks trying to impress a moon priestess, but the artwork is brilliant, and when set up on the table, the central island and its satellites are marvelously evocative in a way that Feld's Alea-published efforts are not.

I paid a considerable sum to import a copy of this game after it went out of print and before it seemed there was any likelihood of a reprint, but the game was worth the price I paid.

Worker placement in a very original jacket. 
The colorful fantasy style of the material, and the odd forms of playing boards almost let you forget that the game is actually pretty abstract and pure worker placement. Nevertheless the many options you have during the game make this game interesting.

Like most Feld games, this is neat package of cogs and wheels, all interacting with each other in intricate ways. On the one hand, I can’t help but admire the creativity that allows this author to design and develop such an array of games that all manage to bring something new to the table. On the other hand, my personal belief is that the current gaming market is so saturated that publishing a single great game is infinitely more worthwhile than publishing three good ones. And so, the question is what keeps Luna from being great?

It is completely luckless and without hidden information, so all variability and tension has to come from the different strategical approaches of the players. At least for our first game, this did not work out so well, because the intricacy of the game makes it initially very hard to develop anything resembling a strategy. Some things fill unnecessarily opaque, like the fact that your monks and buildings count for the beneficial moon priestess, but only the monks count for the not-quite-as-beneficial heretic. My second worry would be about replayability, because while the initial islet layout can be changed from game to game, the crucial entrance way into the temple on the main isle will always be the same. Third and last, this is at heart an abstract game without the least bit of immersion.

All in all, none of these nitpicks keep this from being a good game, and it would have been an absolute must-have game for me six or seven years ago. Time moves on, however, and today - not least due to more polished Feld games like Im Jahr des Drachen or more original ones like Burgen von Burgund - I can only say that I would not consider getting this for my collection, not even as a gift. In other words, a merely good game in 2011 is worth diddly-squat to me.

RATING: 6
Solid worker placement with a bit of area control thrown in for good measure, this game embodies the definition of a euro. The gameplay is pure mechanics with 14 different actions to take during the action phase. There are multiple ways to score during actions, at the end of each round and at game's end. If you enjoy mechanics over theme, you'll love Luna.

Pretty fun.  Challenging to think of the right order of actions to optimize your current turn and set yourself up for an effective next turn.  As soon as you get your plan in place, someone may throw the apostate on your most populated island changing everything, or start rushing the candles... so you might burn your brain to solve a puzzle that won't matter anyway, as you're forced to suddenly play more defensively for the rest of the round, or choose the best thing you can do in 2 or 3 moves rather than 4 or 5.  I think I prefer Castles of Burgundy, Macao, and maybe even Bruges, but it's certainly interesting.

I find Luna both compelling and quite strange. It definitely feels like a Feld game. That is, there are multiple paths to victory, and you can essentially ignore several parts of the game and still win. So, in that way, it's somewhat familiar. Two things, however, make Luna unique. 
The first thing is the theme. This is part of the reason Luna feels odd. Players act as sects of a cultish religion that are vying for influence in order to appoint the next Moon Priestess of the Luna universe. The main board (temple) is placed in the center of the table. This makes thematic sense because religion is central to this civilization. However, most of the action occurs on the satellite islands surrounding the temple. This is where "Lunites" (your novices) live. On the islands, they are taking actions in order to increase the size of their cult, receive special favors, curry favor with the Moon Priestess, avoid the diabolic apostate, etc. Because most actions focus on these outer islands, the temple can be completely ignored. Some people might find that unfortunate, and some might find that liberating. I fall in the latter camp. Nevertheless, I try to visit the temple, if possible. I digress, but the theme, focusing on this fantasy cult, is unique. 

Second, the passing mechanism is awesome and difficult to wrap your head around. In a way, you could say that this game is all about timing. In most euros, you have to be efficient with resources, but usually players have either unlimited actions per turn, or each player gets to take one action per turn. Luna splits the difference. You get as many actions as you want, but the other players can thwart your plans by using the passing mechanism and effectively ending the round. Awesome idea and so intriguing. 

I really like this game. It's hard to rate, because I haven't fully wrapped my head around it yet, but after my first play, I'd have to give it a solid 8.

Update 10/4/14: Played a second game with my wife tonight. I lost again, and pretty badly. I'm not very good at this game so far, but I"m still rather intrigued by it. It is certainly dry. My shelf is overflowing, so any game I keep, I have to really like. I asked my wife what she thought after our second game. She said she really liked it, and would give it an "8" out of 10, which is high praise for her. I'm not jumping up and down after 2 plays, but like I said, I'm still intrigued. I'll hold onto it for a while. As an aside, we did have to read the directions for about 45 minutes before we got to playing (this was after 4 months without a play).

I was honestly surprised how disappointed this game got me. First of all, it's basically an abstract, since there's nothing that get's the theme across for me. And that wouldn't be so bad if the game was actually fun to play. It wasn't for me. 

It's the same basic 'you want to do 3 things more than you can' and 'just make sure you do your orders in the right turn order' that I've seen in so many eurogames that I'm starting to wonder if I still like eurogames. When a game gives me that feeling it can't be a good sign.

Luna feels thematic and is not as point salady as Feld's more recent games. I love the movement mechanism and the interaction between players. One thing I worry about is that in a 2-player game, sanctifying and quickly ending the turn can make a tonne of points and suck the fun out of the game.

One of Feld's stranger games, you are moving people around seven islands, working to build shrines, send your people to the temple and gain favours from the Moon Goddess. It has this really interesting timing aspect where one player can never fully run off and get an infinite amount of actions as passing a turn is done through blowing out candles and once the forth and last candle is blown out the round is over.

I enjoy the way the boards are set up, the special powers you gain and us throughout the game. The passing mechanic imposes an interesting constriction, and I've unfortunately always been on the wrong end, where I've been one move away from doing the thing I intend to do, but I think with time I'll learn to maneuver the game better.

I need to play this again to give it a fair shake. It's a little hard to wrap your head around the first time through. It feels like there are too many mechanics to elevate this one, but I can't say for sure until I get a better feel for it. First play was not nearly as enjoyable as it could be due to the learning curve, so it wouldn't be fair to write this game off yet. I did like the theme and artwork, however.

An excellent area control game with a ton of movement. Feld managed to take some familiar mechanics and meld together a unique game experience.

There's quite a bit of actions available so one can really appreciate that they put together one of the most useful player aids to date.

Bought because the box and multi-piece board were very attractive.  I've played a solo, a 2-player and a 4-player game, and find the crowded temple in the 4-player game adds a lot of tension.  I prefer it that way.  All the possible actions and the way the novices (meeples) move around the islands, activate and inactivate reminded me of Hansa Teutonica.  The graphic design is excellent!

Setting up the guard path is a pain.  Having helpers to set up this game, one on the path, one on the tokens, gets it started 5 minutes faster. 

I fear it will not see play very often as the unusual theme is not an instant hook and as it bears roughly the same difficulty slot in my collection as Hansa Teutonica.

Update: game is still a top-heavy bear to teach but my groups are warming to it.

The theme is lovely as is the art and production of the game..

This is a very unique euro, I cannot think of another game like it.

Also unlike Feld, this one is an action-programming game - not tactical one like his other games.

RATING: 7
Luna is the Moon Priestess, and players are vying to be the succesor. On the board are 7 islands, where round to round, the Moon Priestess and Builder will move around. Players start with novices on some of the islands. 

There are 14 possible actions in this game, but generally players use novices on islands to earn favor tokens, building a shrine where the builder is or moving up in the council for game end scoring. 

Players can also put their novices into the temple to earn points as well. 

There are tactical aspects to the game, since there is an Apostate on one of the islands, and will cost players points if their novices are present at the end of the round. Players can use actions to move the Apostate. Other tactics involve kicking novices out of the temple. Players can choose to end the round by turning over time tokens, so you can put pressure on other players. 

There are a ton of things going on in this Stefen Feld game. There is so much you want to do, but you don't have enough time. There are so many things going on, and it is easy to get caught up on the tactics without looking long term. Being a Feld game, I was a little surprised by the way you could potentially hurt people, by moving the Apostate, or turning over time tokens to cut short the round.  It's interesting to play, but it takes a few plays to get comfortable.

RATING: 6
Quite an unusual theme for Feld, one that I appreciate, while still retaining his signature multiple possible actions that pull you in seemingly orthogonal directions. It combines a bunch of different play mechanisms that together make a unique combination, but the most distinctive feature is probably the round-ending mechanism, whereby 4 players have to forego taking an action before the round ends. This leads to a high level of interactivity for a Feld, with a constant tension between advancing your cause and hurting others'. On the annoying side there is a kind of a keeping up with the Joneses aspect of having to build shrines each round but one, similar to the forced play in In the Year of the Dragon. Altogether a highly tactical game; it'll take a few more plays to tell if the good outweighs the annoying though.

I like this game quite a bit. It's definitely an odd game in both "theme" and how it plays. Explaining it is a bit tricky as a result. 

But it plays really smoothly and has some really challenging decisions. It looks beautiful on the table as well.

RATING: 6
AP inducing game, with 14 different possible actions to consider (not difficult to learn though), and the order of actions being very important for efficiency. Forward planning is necessary and quite possible. The game is about novices on seven helpful islands trying to get in the mainland temple for sanctification or trying to go to the island where the moon priestess is or moving away from the island where the apostate is at the end of the day/round. There is competition for jumping to temple tiles on the mainland, but the meeples/novices heading for the temple are missed on the islands where they help earn favors that help their actions, and movements. There is meeple majority scoring each round at the island where the moon priestess is found in that round, and there is penalty for leaving meeples on the island where the apostate is found. A shrine can be built on an island where the master builder is found. The shrine helps by counting as a meeple in following actions and worth a few VPs at game end. Moving meeples on temple tiles (numbered tiles with predetermined place) into the temple can displace opponents meeples, earn instant VPs and  earn end of round VPs.
There are lots of things to consider, and it is a well designed game, but after one play I don't have the feeling that this is going to be a game that I would want to play very often. After a second play this is confirmed. It is a good game, just takes a little too long for my tastes.

First impression (4 players): Action system uses workers but it isn't really worker placement game since workers in general just are used but they stay on the same spot unless moved. You need to move workers around but it is in general very inefficient. Just type of a game I enjoy, many things to consider and optimizing your (future) moves feels (at least after one game) just enjoyably hard enough.

Currently among my top three of the Essen 2010 crop.

The round end condition scheme creates a wonderful tension of constantly agonizing over how many actions you are going to get this round.

The number of possible actions seems overwhelming at first but gets clearer quite soon, since there are only three ways of scoring points, and most actions need the special tiles.

Always trying to plan a few moves ahead with this one.  No randomness aside from initial set-up means you can decide what you want to do, and take the baby-steps required to get there.  Very fun, especially with the round length being determined by players so you can rush your opponents into making sub-optimal plays.

A convoluted mash of ideas which hang together nicely to make a tense, strategic puzzler. The game rewards forward planning, but still has room for some opportunistic and confrontational play. Don't ask about the theme as there isn't one - despite the nice island tiles and pretty artwork - this has the cold heart of an abstract.

[i]One of my favorite Feld's I've played [i](up there with [thing=25554][/thing] and [thing=35488][/thing])[/i]. Obviously I am drawn to his non-point salad games.

- Theme and components really felt like they were connected to the game play.
- Played great with 2, and only took about an hour.
- Loved the combination of worker placement and area control.
- All of your actions felt like they were working towards a common goal, this is not a point salad game.
- Love working towards those bonus tiles, they really allow you to make some headway during the game.
- Once this game is set up it looks great, excellent production values.
- The candle/turn end mechanic... Amazing.

It's pure Euro, where you wheel your meeples around a stack of locations which change in value at each scoring break, with a raft of possible actions to work through and a number of scoring strategies to explore. Which makes for "interesting decision" central all through the game, weighing up if someone's in a position to kick your ongoing scoring meeples out of the temple, or if you're in danger of being on a negative scoring island, and whether you're going to spend your upcoming actions defensively or continue with your existing strategy of setting up to gain the next set of points. One broad theme is the decision on how far to invest in more meeples - using up meeples now (ie getting them ongoing scoring in the temple) gets more points now (hmmm, if they last) but leaves you less able to do next things, whereas investing in more meeples means foresaking bigger points now for increased flexibility later. But you may be time pressured into not being able to play them all each turn later! I like how this turns the usual no-brainer "invest in more" into a real ongoing decision. There seems to be potential for downtime given the broad decision tree, but I seemed always to have lots to think about so didn't mind if other players needed time themselves. I was pleasantly surprised at the replayability on offer and look forward to playing more.

Played 4 player game with 3 other newcomers to the game and the game's owner.  The game has a lot of different dimensions and the actions are not intuitive. There are a number of options for you actions, and it is easy to forget some of the options, and not very obvious what the best path to victory is.  There is also a dimension where you don't know how much time you have to do the actions you wish to do.  Definitely want to play this game again, but not sure how it will hold up on replay.

Rating after one play: The game itself is not very comlex, just many options are available for the players. A very nice idea for game board even if at first I didn't find it very compelling, I have to say that once you play it everything makes much sense and is well designed. Very good game with a distinct theme, if people would just go away from the victory point winning condition it woult be great.
Update: After learning the new game "Burgen von Burgund" from Feld I decided to lower the vote on this game. This game offers a miriad of possibilities and they are always available to all players. So it gets owerwhelming to choose which one to take. This sometimes is a detractement from the fun. I prefer less choices.

A very original mechanic, where you use tokens to build up actions and place you men on the board. You fight for space and hope not to get bumped by others. It is hard to grasp at the start but give it a chance and you start to see the combinations of moving your men from tile to tile to get additional points.

A little bit like Notre Dame, but I think the theme works a bit better here.  Instead of placing workers to do actions, you sort of displace them.  There is a large number of possible actions available at all times, but they are pretty logical and the player aid is pretty good once you know the iconography.

There's really a lot going on in this game.  Part of the game felt like Maharaja, where you're trying to follow a marker around the board for scoring (and also anti-Maharaja, where you're trying to avoid another piece that moves around the board).  The other main piece involved moving your pawns to the center for "king of the hill"-style scoring, where later-placed pawns are more likely to bump off earlier pawns.  The third part of the game is collecting tokens from the 7 different islands, that let you more easily get pawns, move them around, and influence the other parts of the game.  While it was certainly difficult to wrap your head around at first, I thought it tied together well.  Definitely scratches the planning itch, as you need to be thinking a few turns into the future to do well.

RATING: 7
Probably too many move options on a given turn;  It's not like Agricola where there may be 20 places to place a pawn, each with different, albeit often similar, benefits;  Rather there are 20 distinct actions to try to remember. Might be good if you got to play it a lot, but I am not convinced it is great for the occasional "how-does-this-go-again" play

Gorgeous, irregular, modular board. Superfluous theme; these people could just as well be the local quilting club. Players who can tolerate disjoint point-grabbing games with tough decisions require several layers of planning ahead should enjoy it. This one nudged Stefan Feld toward the top of my genius meter.

This is a good Stefan Feld game. Many ways to victory (is this his typical point salad that everyone talks about?). I like the feeling that there are many good choices to make, yet little time to execute them well. This makes for good suspense and positive stress. Timing is key! Nice and streamlined.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A ton of different actions to choose from, but they are all rather simple. You only have so many guys to activate and once they're done, you have very little to do after. I like how one player can control the time of each round. I do think this is on the weaker end of Felds games for me that I enjoy. It's a fine game, but it's a bit mechanical for me. It's really just about manipulating your guys to get them into position for next round. Reminds me a bit of Aquasphere, but for some reason hasn't grabbed me like that game.

I think this game plays better with more players, but it works fine with all player counts. The inner sanctum is far more interesting and involved when you have 4 players duking it out, barely being protected by books.

Not sold on the solo aspect yet. It's easy enough to play, but I liked the competition and the precarious countdown of the candle tokens. It works, but I'd choose other solo games over this.

Luna is a game that doesn't really grab me. You do a lot of stuff, but none of it is very interesting. You have a bunch of meeples on islands, and you use them to get more meeples, or move them to other islands, or gain tokens that you can then use to move meeples, &c. 

What's odd about this game is that there is a lot of planning, but it still feels mostly tactical. You need to go through multiple steps to accomplish something (get the meeples in the right place, with the right token, and so on) so you need to plan ahead, but that's really just maximizing your points for that turn and setting up for the next. You can't create grand plans, you can only try to be efficient.

There is player interaction, but it seems a bit forced. On one island each turn there's area majority, there's a track where the higher player breaks ties, and you can displace meeples in the temple by placing yours next to them. But it doesn't feel like my plan vs. the opponents' plans, it's just some factors in the tactical puzzle.

Most stuff you do ends up scoring the same number of points anyway; there are a lot of ways to use 1 meeple for 1 point. What I do find interesting is the temple: if you get a meeple in early, it gives you multiple points, and as long as the meeple isn't kicked out by a new meeple, it scores 1 point per turn. But during that time, you can't use it for anything else. So at least early on you have a real choice of putting meeples in the temple (lowering the number of meeples on islands, but scoring points), or getting extra meeples (which doesn't score points, at least not directly).

That sounds pretty interesting, and it is, at least in theory. In practice, a lot of time is spent on just doing stuff and scoring points, and watching your opponents do the same, without any sort of direction, spectacular moves or anything that would enliven it a little. Not a bad game at all, there's nothing I hate about it, but there's not much to really get excited about either.

I don't get why so many people are calling this worker placement. It isn't. In all but one case, taking an action has no effect whatsoever on an opponent taking the same action.

This is a really unique game where you have workers, but you don't take them back after a round, they need to be transported from place to place with actions and resources. There are points for ending the round with the moon priestess token, who wanders the board, and points for getting guys into the big center temple. This is a game where you really need to plan a few rounds ahead in order to really take advantage of your workers, and it's Feldian in the way that you need X to do Y to do Z. It's a fantastic brain burner with simple choices that lead to significant results.

Wow, this one got stuck in my head. I love the self-balancing feature of the candle - allowing players who haven't built up as much of an engine to cause the round to end early.

It felt like it took way too many actions for something to happen, but it also felt interactive and vicious.

I think I liked it, but I'm not sure who would play it with me. No rating until I've tried it a couple more times.

"Luna" plays a bit like chess, only it's actually fun and a lot faster. Every outcome can be calculated, there's absolutelly no random factor (except the setup to make the game replayable). 

At first, the multitude of avaible actions may feel overwhelming, but in reality everything is simple - 1 game is enough to grasp all the rules. What's important though is that all the games of "Luna" play in a completely different way. Not only the isle setup is crucial, but also all the moves your opponent makes. There's no single strategy to win this game and situation on the board can change drastically from turn to turn. Plus the possibility of dictating the tempo of the game is simple, yet ingenious. You can ruin all the intricate plans of your opponent by accelerating the turn.

I love it and I feel with every game I will love it more. Very clever game, the theme is misleading in my opinion - makes "Luna" look less serious than it should. Cause' it's a real brainburner. 

UPDATE: Bye bye, Luna. Loved you, but my gaming partners didn't... Not everyone has good taste ;)

A surprisingly good game. Scales well with 1-4 players. Plenty of strategy. Must remember to plan ahead for Priestess and Builder movement. Being able to move the Apostate is a nice confrontational part to the game.

Another solid game from Feld. Unique movement, plenty of planning, and a tight balance between scoring and investing. Another WP game that feels innovative/different, although you must get past the horrible pasted on theme.

Rating after one play.

Original and impressive. Lots of moving pieces, and lots of ways to generate actions and VPs. Nice components and effective component design, in spite of the peculiar theme. And surprisingly nasty, with opportunities for blocking and running out the clock. Could be a real winner.

This seems to be one of Feld's most underappreciated games. It admittedly contains relatively few of his unmistakeable fingerprints (although some are still there), but is nonetheless an excellent game that I wish I could play more often. It is a perfect-information Eurogame, something which seems to be out of fashion these days, where each player selects one from a very large selection of actions each turn - each one is incredibly simple in itself, but understanding what to do and when, and how to chain actions together to good effect (especially taking the other player(s) into account - there is much player interaction here of a relatively subtle kind), is incredibly hard. And this game is a bit different from most Euros in how it works - many of your actions simply move workers around from one place to another, where they may serve a purpose this round or next. Despite the perfect information, the variable setup should keep each game relatively fresh. Overall, this is one of my personal favourite Felds, but it's definitely never going to be a mainstream favourite.

Luna is a strange animal... It's a very open-ended design, and there is a fair amount of complexity attached to it, but it is extremely easy to grasp and play after a first, potentially, painful game. It is well worth going through that first play however as there is a gem in there...

Great components
Game play is simple enough but still has tactical and strategic depth.
The theme is interesting and integrates well enough into the game.
It seems like there are a lot of different paths to victory.

Set up is a bit fiddly (I think of this as the downside for the great components).

RATING: 7
Rather fiddly (both physically (setup/teardown and moving meeples/etc around) as well as all the miscellaneous types of actions to learn) but interesting and fun when I'm in the mood for this kind of euro. One after the other, players activate your meeples and move them around to do all kinds of actions ultimately to finish with highest score, until finally players have passed 4 (or 3 depending on number of players) times in a round. After 6 rounds, high score wins. No randomness or hidden info during play, and failure to plan as well as opponents will certainly set you back and make you lose.

The big irregular shaped board + 7 islands take up more table space than I'd like. But the ability to randomize the order of the 7 islands during setup (and various other setup things) is good.

Enjoyed 2- and 3-player and also played the solitaire variant (which is OK but not great: it seems not hard to beat, and is highly abstracted so does not feel very much like playing vs a real player to me).

RATING: 8.758
This game has fairly simple rules and an unusual board in that it is divided into separated sections that represent eight different islands. You move your meeples (novices) from island to island gathering resources (favor tiles) and then spending those resources to gain points or extra actions. There is more strategy to this game than I first thought and now I find myself thinking about it when I'm not playing it. What I like most about it are the tricky, clever moves that I am discovering with additional plays. The game is well balanced, meaning that once you get up to speed, only a few points should separate the winner from second place.

Watched three videos and couldn't follow it. The roles and actions seemed very strange, unthematic, and I just didn't grok it. Once I did sit through rules I couldn't tell what actions were worth doing. But after two rounds I was suddenly wanting to do everything in the game...but the other players wouldn't let me, because they could pass and hurry along the end of the round. So I was often going "I need like 3 or 4 more actions to do everything I want to do, but it looks like two other players are going to end the round in 1 or 2 actions, so what can I get away with here to maximize this round?"

It was so frustrating that they ended things early, but it made the game that much more interesting as well. I really enjoyed playing the game, and I can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 7
This Stefan Feld game is one of his least-Feldian designs.  It's sort-of-worker-placement, as you have priests at islands, each of which enables a specific action and claiming a matching subset of victory point tiles, or you can use their actions to move them to other islands or recruit more priests, both for next turn.  The turn ends once four pass actions are taken across all players, so you can't have long sprawling action chains without getting cut off by other more efficient players.  Instead of point salad, sources for points are fairly limited, mostly coming from contesting ownership for the turn of the island currently hosting the moon priestess, building a shrine at the island currently hosting the master builder, or claiming one of the tiles in the central temple, with the claiming priests sitting there generating an extra point per turn until kicked out by someone claiming an adjacent tile.  This also acts as a balancing mechanism, as claiming the scoring tiles will take your priests out of commission for a while, reducing your ability to do more stuff.  There's randomness in the initial setup, but after that it's all deterministic and open information, which does tend to promote a bit of AP, as you need to be planning three or four turns ahead and keeping an eye on what others will be doing.

This could have been titled Macao II, but you don't play a Stefan Feld game for the theme, right? I feel I could still be in Macao. Anyway, it's got all the multiple scoring devices - wall, city tiles, etc, - the cards have been replaced with seven simple action chits, and the dice on the wind rose have been replaced with swimming workers and permanent temples.

The game affords players the opportunity to put together some nice combinations with their workers and action chits that requires forward planning under time pressure of the turn time expiring as the candle blows out. There's low player interaction - some racing to grab tiles first, a majority points island, getting bumped from the temple, a few points to lose if the evil dude gets shifted to an island with your folks. Nothing that matters in the scheme of things too much. (I think I prefer the race to islands in Macao and blocking of groups in the city better.) Anyway, you can plan in peace - nothing will upset your tactics that you can't shift in another direction easily enough.

It all works well and is obviously different enough to have its own fan base. I can certainly enjoy both this and Macao, but I do find myself tiring of these themeless games. If only Feld could tie his excellent mechanics together with a really strong theme he'd have a home run. This is a good solid game with a puzzle aspect to it that'll give me repeated play with simple, easy to remember rules, but it faces a lot of competition in todays saturated game market. It's just a shame that a game with good strong mechanics will in a few years be lost in the the crowd for want of a strong matching theme. For now I can enjoy it - boardgame of the month for me.

Luna -- (Played once, four-player)

My thoughts on the game are well capsulized by comments made by Greg Schloesser and Mike Siggins.

Greg wrote, "players can choose from a wide variety of actions and are free to combine them in clever manners in attempts to achieve their objectives. The game is extremely open-ended and doesn’t follow a scripted path that far too many games employ."

Mike wrote "Probably a bit frustrating and 'forward planny' for me. Do not play with AP peeps."

The comments of Patrick Brennan (PBrennan) and Jennifer Schlickbernd (jschlickbernd) also fit my perceptions.

The thing is, we took a very long time to play our four-player game (over three hours), and I can't imagine it playing much faster, even allowing for familiarity.  Still, I'd choose Luna's slower open-ended play over Puerto Rico's quicker scripted play any day.

Played once with 3P. Luna defies expectations of a Feld game as it is difficult to pin down exactly what it is all about – I suppose it is first and foremost a game of arranging novices on islands in order to get actions you need. A distinction in Luna is that it is purely luckless beyond the initial setup and emphasises forward planning instead. The end result is a massive logistical puzzle on how to distribute your limited pieces around the islands so that you will be able to activate a desirable sequence of actions, all while bearing in mind that the board subtly (but predictably) shifts every round and that there is limited negative interaction from other players as well. Whew!

In some ways, Luna follows the more calculative feel of [thing=102680][/thing] and [thing=31594][/thing], but with more possible actions. Something that stands out for me in this game is the player-controlled timing system, which pressures players to find the most efficient route before their opponents snuff out all the candles.

The serious downside is that Luna is remarkably prone to some serious AP, which is unsurprising given that it is a game of perfect information. Several viable options are presented every turn, and players will inevitably take long pauses to mentally form and evaluate chains of actions in their head. Downtime issues aside, this is a solid, if not a little overlooked, game.

The theme on this one makes me cringe a little. While it is nice to see something new (ie. so sick of churches, Egypt, Merchants etc.) it feels a little too new age for me. This could have been cooler if it was themed with Pirates, ninjas or Outer Space! As is typical with Stefan Feld's game designs, this could have been any theme. He is easily one of my favorite designers and this game is very enjoyable so far. I look forward to exploring the many options this game has to offer.

Egyedi játék, munkáslehelyezés egy kicsit megbonyolítva. 7 sziget között rendezgethetjük az embereinket, akik az adott helyen valamilyen különleges lapkát tudnak megszerezni, amivel a játékunkat segíthetjük. 3 különleges ember lépked a szigeteken a játék közben, akik plusz, illetve mínusz pontokat hozhatnak többség és számosság alapján. A harmadik, építőmester jelenléte pedig szentély építésének lehetőségét teremti meg, amivel egy emberünk munkája félig-meddig felszabadul. Ezen kívül van egy fő rész, ahova szintén érdekes mechanizmus alapján juttathatunk embereket, ami a fő győzelmi pont bevételi lehetőség a játékban. A kör befejezési mechanizmus, 4 passz és ebből az utolsó díjazott is nagyon jól eltalált dolog. Nagyon nehéz volt pontoznom a Lunát. Akár 8-ast is adhattam volna rá, mert nem nagyon találok benne hibát, de valahogy nem éreztem azt a 8-ast érzést a játék végén. Mindenképp kell még vele játszani. mert elsőre nem is nagyon lehet ráérezni mindenre. Jó játék a Luna, gémereknek feltétlenül kipróbálandó.

RATING: 3.5
This is truly a well designed game. It has a good balance with lots of decisions to make, long term strategic planning and player interaction.  

Sadly, I just found no joy in it. I found it to be one long, repetitive exercise in point accumulation.  The game rewards over-thinking everything, and steeling yourself when others come along and mess everything up.  Most of the game is about timing, if you aren't in synch it is easy to get closed out.  

Mostly, I just found the game to be a lot of work where your reward excessive planning is 6 points instead of 4 points.  Perhaps there was a time when I would enjoy this efficiency puzzle, but now I just find it exhausting and far more work than worth.  It doesn't help that the game drags on far longer than I think it needs to.  I mean, sure there are lots of things to do, but really I feel like the game is just about installing toggle switches and on your turn you get to flip one or work to install a new toggle.

It also is especially frustrating when it is clear that you can't win halfway through the game. I usually will try to play for place, but when you know that your last two turns will still give you a last place standing, there isn't much incentive to care. I like the concept of the point return investment tying up your workers early, but if your guys get booted, they are still tied up unless you take a specific tile driven action for them to get back to work.  And as the points diminish from any placement in the center, so too do the returns on lingering workers in the center space. So, a player in last has a harder and harder time to be competitive.

I did like the movement in it.  That is about the only fun I found.

This is a fun little game, at least at first blush.   I was immediately struck by the superficial similarity to the classic Avalon Hill game "Wizards" in Luna's use of the island-theme.   The box art on Luna is also vaguely reminiscent of Wizards.   Unfortunately,  the theme in Luna is truly a "paste-on".   Virtually none of the worker placement actions make any thematic sense, they are total abstractions.  I've played the game about 10 times and it has definitely palled with each playing.  I've reduced it from a 7.5

With all the new worker placement titles, it's hard to find something that really seems to have something innovative, but this game certainly has it. There's a fine balance between getting new workers and racing through a round to get done what needs to be done before someone finishes the round - if you can be efficient, others can be left wanting.

Move your novices around the islands, collecting tokens and more novices, building shrines, and go to worship in the temple. You must think ahead, and set yourself up for your next turn on *this* turn.  Your novices become inactive, and unable to move. 

There is ONE action per player, so next to no downtime for other players.  

One interesting feature of Luna is that the rounds are of variable length, and the players decide how long the round lasts, using the candlelight/meditation mechanic.  This can be used to see what your opponent is going to do, or to end the round before they can do it! This adds tension to the game, and hilariously, can be used to bluff your opponents.  All this means that timing is everything!

This is also a no luck game, which I appreciate.  I need a break from complex games including luck.

Another really interesting game by Stefan Feld -- becoming one of my favorite designers, it seems!

This is a worker-placement/action selection/area influence type of game where the workers stay where they ended the previous round. Like the rondel games, it's one where you have to plan what you want to do over several turns -- each turn is a micro-step along the path to get to where you want to go. For example, if you want to build a shrine, you have to get 2 meeples to the island; to move meeples, you need a wave or boat token; to get a token, you have to have 2 meeples on the matching island, which will jump off the island (into the surrounding water) to take the action. You only get to do a single thing on each of your turns, and the rounds are of variable length (ending when players pass a total of 4 times) so you can never know for sure that you'll be able to finish what you start (unless it's a short-duration sequence, of course). Oh, and there's also an interesting positioning element where you try to get meeples into the temple into such a configuration that you knock other players out of the temple while protecting yourself from being knocked out!

Looking forward to this coming to Yucata!!
----------
After several more plays online (Yucata), this is losing it's shine a bit. Still an interesting game, but just not as much fun for me as his heavy dice games.

--- Summary ---
Starting setup is to place the 7 islands around the temple in random order. Place the cutouts into the temple in random configuration. Randomly distribute the temple tokens numbered 1-n; 1 is starting player. Place them, with a book token and your meeple, in the designates spaces in the temple. The rest of the temple tokens are arranged on a path around the outside of the Temple, with the guard spaces interspersed every n spaces and the guard token on the 6 space. Place player wooden discs on first space of the appropriate track, with last player on top. Place Priestess, Architect, and Apostate tokens on random islands. In order, players first place a shrine on one of the islands (with no other shrine on it), then 4 pairs of priest meeples on islands with no other meeples/shrine of your own color. Each island is seeded with n favor tokens matching the island type. After all shrines/meeples placed, players receive one token from each of the two islands without their tokens. 

On your turn, take a single action -- one of 14 choices! Taking island actions require you to move 2 meeples (or 1, if you have a shrine there) from the island into the surrounding water. Actions include, for example:
- getting a favor token (may only have 1 of each type at any time)
- build shrine (only at island with Architect; must spend shrine favor token)
- recruit new priest (placed in water with the two that jumped off the island)
- move any/all of your priests to water spaces around any islands (must spend wave token)
- take book token (each player placed one initially in temple) from one location and put it under one of your meeples in the temple
- move priest from island to matching token on path (one of the priests jumping off the island to take the action; placed on token matching type of island; to place past Guard token, must spend coin favor token).
- meditate (pass): flip one of the candle tokens; round over when all 4 tokens flipped
- sanctify: move token/meeple from path around temple into temple; score 2-6VP, depending on which round it is. If other player's meeples are on adjacent lower-numbered tiles and without a book token, move them to the dock and score 1VP each.

All spent favors are returned to the island they came from. When the round ends, players score 1VP per meeple in the temple and VP for being on same island as Priestess (area influence style, based on priests/shrines on island; in 4er game, 6/3/1 for 1st/2nd/3rd place). They lose 1VP per wooden token (shrine or priest) on island OR in surrounding water where Apostate is located. Then, return all meeples from water to adjacent island. Next, move Priestess, Apostate and Architect to other islands (as many islands clockwise as the number on the token; Apostate goes clockwise to next island with any meeples on it).

After 6 rounds, score 4VP per built shrine. Most VP wins!

Played a single game with three players. This is one of the most interesting pure euros I've played these last few months. I like Stefan Feld's designs but this one has a totally different feeling. Usually his games have a lot of playing against mechanics. Luna doesn't have any of those. It has solid, brain burner decisions, a considerable amount of interaction (mainly the temple occupation and also - maybe the most important - the way players influence the number of turns, and some very clever and functional mechanics - like the end of turn mechanic for example. It reminds me a bit of Princes of Macchu Pichu.

The game has several paths for victory although I think that a balanced strategy seems to work better than running for something specific.

One of the best games I've played this year (after Essen)

UPDATE:
After a few more plays with different number of players I can now for sure say that this game is in fact quite good.

Luna is nominated for the "Jogo do ANo 2010" award by Spiel Portugal (http://www.spielportugal.org/jogo-do-ano/2010/nomeados)

I like the rule book - well written ,clear and with a nice explanation of the link between the worker actions (ok novice actions) and the theme. 

So worker placement with fighting for position in the temple. The twist is that you need to manoeuvre your workers between islands so 3 actions involve this movement,there is also timing issues as the end round condition (candles) is v clever.

RATING: 8
Heavier Stefan Feld game, notable for having no random elements and perhaps a little less point salad than some of his other recent efforts (Trajan, Bora Bora). [-]Workers[/-]novices on the "seven holy island" are activated to claim bonus tiles (one-off abilities) or to place tiles in the central temple. The major point-scoring comes from placing and keeping novices in the temple or by having a majority on the island the priestess is visiting at the end of a round. Of course, the rest of the system is a typical Feld efficiency exercise.

It all interlocks nicely, and the temple makes for perhaps the most interactive Feld subsystem to date -- the ability to protect novices from displacement even adds a minor element of incentive management.

For all that Luna lacks any particular novelty to make it stand out, it's a solid, polished game and one of Feld's best heavier games.

On first playing, I think it is an interesting game.  On reading the other comments, I think it's a shame so many people are obsessed with "theme."  They complain and complain about medieval Europe settings and then when somebody tries something different, they complain about that.

First time Stefan Feld has left me a bit disappointed as the game play lacks the certain "angst" of his other designs.
I wonder whether Hall games is something like the "cemetary of unwanted designs": Rosenberg's Loyang (Hall instead of Lookout) and Feld's Luna (Hall instead of alea).
Klemens Franz's graphics are excellent, however, and pretty much induced me to buy the game unseen.

Update:
After repeated plays I tend to like the game more and more. A "softer" Feld, but still a Feld!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Didn't knock me out as much as most other Stefan Feld games have, but maybe the gameplay is just a bit more subtle than I expected. The way workers are used for actions, and become spent for the turn is quite interesting. Need to play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pretty game with good play and some unusual twists. At first glance it looks like worker placement, but the spatial element of needing to move your apprentices around and lack of "one person per action" set it apart. While you don't race for resources, there's plenty of competition in bumping each other off temple spaces and competing for majorities when the priestess arrives. And sending the apostle to mess up your opponents.

Man, this is one interesting game.  There's a ton of choices available to you on every turn so it can be a lot to consider at first, but this is one of those interesting games that plays backwards offering infinite choices at first and less as the game goes on.

Great artwork and presentation add a nice touch to it.  I don't think one game is quite fair to rate this one, but I'll start at 7/10 as of 2/19/11.

Hard to judge after one play but I never really engaged with the theme and didn't find the decisions interesting. Can't see myself trying it again. It's a Feld game so you probably already know if that's your sort of thing. Not as much of a point salad type game but still not for me.

Gorgeous artwork, good to great initial reviews and Stefan Feld made me very interested in this title. Finally got to play it for the first time yesterday. Initially I had no idea of what I wanted to do or where I was supposed to go, but after 2 rounds, everything was clear and I knew I was doing... not as good as I should :)  But the game offers a lot of options but since it had microturns (you can do only 1 thing on your turn, the only question is: what will you do?) it never takes too long for your turn to come around. I'm sure this game has more in store and will offer great replay value. Looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 7
I am fairly certain that half the game is just setting it up right! Having said that, while feeling less like a Feld game than you might expect, it still presents multiple paths to victory. Extremely tight control of actions you're able to take vs your ability to take them add urgency. This game really demands more forward planning than a lot of other games we've played. Beautiful art with a less common theme.

This game basically sums up my feeling about Feld games (The Spiecherstadt apart); perfectly well designed and some interesting choices, but I never feel overly involved or as though I'm actually having fun.

The mass of choices isn't overwhelming, just none of them felt any different to all of the others.

The brilliance of Luna is that even if you play a poor strategic game, you still get an abundance of interesting tactical decisions all the way to the end.  The actions make little thematic sense, and most involve two novices jumping into a lake.  Still, the game is well-constructed and the hard part is simply teaching it.  The mystical theme haunts like moonlit dreams, which would please the nigh priestess Luna herself.

A hard game to rate, I liked it, I think...but at the same time it felt very constraining.  There are a lot of possible actions but they are not easy to be able to do.  You have to setup your moves and can only squeeze a limited number of actions out of a turn.

Nothing about the game wowed me and I didn't leave my plays feeling very excited about the game, but there isn't anything wrong with it either.

What a really interesting game this is. Nothing really down to say about this one. You have to pay close attention and timing is certainly a huge factor. This is going to be a lot of fun exploring this one. s

UPDATE: A few more plays down and Luna climbs to 9. 

As a 2 player game this one works surprisingly well. I half expected it to fail but no it's solid at 2. The way the board scales makes the interaction in the temple still very tense.

Another masterpiece from Mr. Feld, this worker placement game offers lots of varied play with its player-driven opening and random map component positioning.  Agonizing choices to make, given the several different sources of influence (victory) points.  The unique player-controlled round countdown timer forces one to forgo desired actions and maintain priority throughout the game.

Took me a few look overs before I bought this game...  The mechanics are very cool, it is a relaxing game and it sets a nice mood.  Key Factor, this game is NOT a luck game, and there is minimal to no luck factor.  Every-time I think about playing a game, this one comes to mind.  If you like a different unique game that dispels luck, give this one a try.

First impressions: There are some issues with the rule book; BGG forums were helpful in clarifying a couple of ambiguous details. Also, the colors of some of the tiles are incredibly hard to distinguish, though you soon realize it doesn't matter, you can figure it out a different way...still, unbelievably poor color choices. After those startup issues get ironed out:  A weird sort of worker-placement game, takes more than a round or two to really get it figured out. Actions have serious consequences, so it gets very thinky. I think we might end up liking it quite a bit.

Couple more plays: Still quite difficult to get good at; we're liking it a lot. Of the eight or so Feld games we have tried so far, this is probably going to be in the top half.

The game is very dry and abstract and seems to be all about gaining tiny efficiencies. While I don't generally care much about theme, I would like this better with a better-integrated theme - the current one works so poorly (with inactive novices apparently swimming around in the ocean until allowed back on land) that it just highlights how abstract everything is.

A well designed game by master designer Stefan Feld. I like most of his other offerings better however. This is mainly due to the fact that decisions in Luna are not as painful as in some of his other games, like In The Year Of The Dragon or Notre Dame, and it does not offer the same feeling of progression. The game is also more repetitive and lasts a bit longer than it should. Still, I would not mind playing it again, as I do feel that there is a learning curve. I just do not prefer it above other worker placement games, like The Village or Hansa Teutonica (which can both be played in a shorter time frame).

Fun game with multiple paths to victory. Very interesting take on worker placement. The game seems pretty hard to teach though. There's a lot going on and I found it hard to see the big picture until a few rounds in. There's quite a few possible actions, which can be hard to digest all at once.

Probably not something I'd ever be interested in purchasing and feel no need to play again.

Interesting turn by turn planning, but I'm having a hard time getting seriously exited about it. The art here is cool, though not as darkly moody as the box would lead you to believe.  The mechanics are pretty familiar: points per turn, advanced worker placement, etc.  You've played a lot of games like this, almost certainly.  But it's pretty solid, as far as this type of majority exercises go.

RATING: 9
Move your workers around the islands, collecting tokens and more workers, building shrines, and move your workers into the temple. Quite a bit of thinking ahead required in this one, as you really have to prepare your next turn on *this* turn, since moving your guys isn't very easy, as they become inactive. Compounding matters is the fact that certain actions can only be done at certain places, and they move each turn. Feld games have done very well in our household, and this was quite enjoyable. Everyone's favourite part was Herb Island, where your workers were invigorated and refreshed by consuming some "herbs".

Ranks high up there with Amerigo for a non-point salad Feld. Like this even more than Amerigo though. Movement/turn maximization and slightly puzzly. Plus, player interaction!

RATING: 6
I like games where instead of just slapping a worker down on an action space, you have to move your workers around the board to the right places in order to do the things you want. Luna is such a game (Princes of Machu Picchu is another prominent example that comes to mind). I also enjoy the spatial mini game inside the temple, and how it plays into your action sequencing on the islands. Timing is a major part of the game and drives much of the tension- good stuff. My two biggest complaints are: (1) going first in a round is very advantageous, but your ability to control who's the start player is very limited (Trajan also has this problem), (2) the game is one round too long for what it is; consistently I have found the final round of Luna to be boring and superfluous. But despite these qualms I enjoy playing it and am happy to have it in my collection- it's a solid, unique experience.

RATING: 6
Well, it seems like a unique game.  The odd mechanisms using the people and the library and the tokens and all the rest are something I haven't seen before, and it all works pretty well together.  I mean, in my first game, I came in dead last, but there were only six points separating me from the winner, and near the end, I felt like I was being terribly inefficient.  It seems to be like every other Feld game I've played (there was something about the layout of the board that reminded me a lot of the market in Macao, if nothing else), so I expect if you like his style of games, you'll like this one, too.  Me?  Well, I'll play it, but I'm not going to go out of my way to buy it.

A different kind of Feld. It may seem unintuitive at first, but when you finally understand the interrelations between all these mechanisms a great game unfolds before you.

not a bad game, it just suffers of too complicated rules for what it is. There are several interesting new original mechanics, different strategies you can follow, many things you want to do and just not enough time. The theme is pasted on and it doesn't help in understanding what is going on. It is somehow subtle and interesting, just not too much. You'll need more than one game to understand exactly what you want to do and how to do it.

The Moon Princess is stepping down and we are sect followers vying to be chosen as her successor. Tile and worker placement, area control of islands. Getting books, bribing guards, gain influence with the council of elders as the candle burns shorter. Workers catching waves between islands, beware the whispers of the apostate. Build shrines and protect your sect majority. Weird game adds to its charm and memorableness. Lots to think about which is expected in a Feld game.

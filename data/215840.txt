You must solve a series of riddles and puzzles to escape from a room. Each correct solution brings you to another riddle. How fast can you escape the room? This game can be played only once, because you markup, fold, and tear the game materials.

Like the theme of this one. A couple of the puzzles were a little odd but the game was enjoyable overall.

This one is on the harder side but the puzzles are consistently enjoyable with some clever ones as always. This is also the first one that presents you with a choice that has some effect on the outcome (there is no wrong choice though).

One puzzle in this one really frustrated us after checking the solution, and I think that this series of Exit games has finally run out of steam for us (I've played through all 6 currently available to buy). I've rated it a 7 as some of the puzzles are very good, but fundamentally there is only so much you can do to keep this format fresh and exciting - it doesn't even have the story-telling prowess/advantages that a game like TIME Stories does, for example. I rated the first three games a 9-10, and the second batch all lower. I might check out a few in the future, but my partner has already decided that she's done with the series after this batch of three, particularly one that I rated a 4.

This one was the hardest of the Exit games that I've played until today. We couldn't wrap our head around some of the puzzles and so it was a kind of frustrating experience.

I was initially excited by this particular decoder, but ultimately felt like the theme could have been better incorporated. Still a good set of puzzles, even if a bit too number heavy. The final puzzle was neat.

A nice difficulty - some meta-gamey puzzles but still had the clues that drove you toward thinking of those things, rather than having to guess in the dark.  I liked this one a lot despite doing quite poorly in it.  Tricksy!

[url=http://fortressat.com/articles-analysis/2767-idiots]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url]

RATING: 7
Out of the 4 games in the Exit series that I've played (Abandoned Cabin, Pharoah's Tomb, Secret Lab, Forbidden Castle) this is the most difficult. We're constantly stumped by the puzzles and had very difficult time piecing the different pieces of the puzzle together. That said there are a few smart tricks in this game which will catch even experienced players by surprise. Great addition to the series.

RATING: 4
Much more difficult, and not in a fun way, than Exit: The Lab. Several times we were stuck and neither hint card told us anything new. The solution card then provided an answer that was very obscure based on the given information. The final puzzle also just plain did not work. We attempted it the correct way several times before checking the solution, then trying it again and getting the same (wrong) results. I could see what they were going for, but it was very specific and the angles of things did not allow for it to be that specific. All in all, a fairly frustrating experience after being extremely impressed with Exit: The Lab. Such a shame, as the theme for this one really deserved better.

Previously played Polar station and Secret lab, from 3 of them this seemed way too.... easy. I thought it will be needed replay it over and over like 5 times, but nope, beat it playing slowly in one sitting, like 2h. Didn't used any hints. So this for level 4 seemed way too easy for me.

If you have paper with you, you really can play without damaging anything in book. We just redraw and cut things on separate blank paper where needed.

My God, what went through their mind here? 

I love Exit. I really liked "The Abandon Cabin" (their best for us). But this one shows that this series is quickly going downhill.

It's difficult, very difficult, but unfairly so. We don't mind a good challenge, but the feeling of unfairness here comes from several issues which were always present in this series, but are exacerbated here:

- You never really know if you have all the necessary hints to tackle a puzzle. This issue reaches new heights of frustration here. Some puzzles are so far-fetched that after tackling them, you look at what seems like other incomplete puzzles but tell yourself: "hey, maybe I do have everything, and maybe they expect me to cut this out, and try this and that, or any circumvoluted solution".  

- Why not use the theme a bit? Puzzles are just too abstract. It was not as true in Abandoned Cabin. Here, all that ties to the theme is the visuals. The rooms you are supposed to get into a just placeholder art to feature abstract symbols. You'll never feel like you are opening a door, you are just solving some riddle that has absolutely nothing to do with a door mechanism.

- Maybe it's time for Exit to make a real use of an app. At some point, we were tired of getting back to the same page to translate numbers into key parts. It's so limiting to have every possible solution become a key part.

- Less would be more here. 2 hours +. Sure, some better escape room veterans must be able to do it faster, but we are not bad at all at this, and the difficulty was too high with some puzzles being really, really arcane. 

- Seriously, some of the meta-gamey puzzles are just so absurdly far-fetched that we spent more time laughing to tears than solving riddles here. Two of them in particular, the 4 knights and 3 shields riddle (no spoiler here, no worries) and the final puzzle were so funny that we kept the parts for laughs on later evenings: "Do you remember that crazy riddle in Exit: The Forbidden Castle?" - "Oh my, Please, that was insane!"

I hope that the designers will be able to steer the ship in right direction for season 3...

It took us 1 1/2 hours, and we needed more clues that we usually like, but we still ended up with 5 stars. So I guess we did well despite what we thought was a rough go at it. The puzzles were difficult, but satisfying as we slowly solved them.

Jul'16 I guess I don't really like co-op tower defence game ...... repetitive too I guess...... but I can understand some gamer liking it .......

Great game with a great deal of fun. I had purchased the full supply of meeples, which I think added to the enjoyment (did need cubes to supplement unit types as rounds got into later stages). !!! Rule book is still in serious need of overhaul!! Too many vague situations; seems like mostly translation , also that there are assumptions that players need to make but cannot necessarily grasp.

Too random and too punishing. A bad dice roll will destroy the work of hours. It does offer an entertaining city building experience and does a good job at rendering the siege of said city.
The abilities of the buildings are exciting and thematically fitting. It's a good sandbox, that needs some houseruling, because playing through the early stages again and again isn't too exciting.
It's designed to be unwinnable with average luck, I suppose.

Great game with good art that is hampered by a poorly put-together rulebook, and inconsistencies/errors. 9/10 for the game itself when everything is ironed out. 7/10 for the game in its state at release.

I like this game, but without custom meeples to identify things is annoying to deal with.  

From what I hear of Kingdom Death Monster, I think this would be kind of like a short light version of that (deisgn as like 4 chapters where you are building up your city and preparing, etc.)

4 of 20 rounds in 4 hours and really lousy rules, which are ambiguous and contradictionary in several places. Also too many reference tables to handle without any overview. The ideas are interesting, but it got boring after a while.

If you like Stronghold, you would love this game more because this one is co-op.

absolutely incredible game, however the RULE BOOK IS TERRIBLE. this is the only fault with this game. which is a shame as it would most definitely be a must have game otherwise.

hoping that a reprint of the rule book (yes even better than the 1.1 version) is released.

Great city building/tower defense coop/solo game. Albeit epic in length, it feels very rewarding to see the town/city slowly improve in a beautiful way, thanks to the gorgeous puzzle tiles. Unfortunately the rulebook is messy (even the 1.1 rules are often unclear), but the player aid fixes most of it.

Can't wait for this game. It's quite awesome playing along 15 hours in plays of 90' with a built-in save system.

Update: Sold because I couldn't understand the rulebook. Poor materials. A total deception.

Description is way-too-long! Put this stuff in the "More Information" box, please. I started to read but then, like my kitty cat, got distracted by lint. Oh and the dust bunnies! It is so much fun to watch them swirl. Is that how swirl is spelled? Can I write "spelt"? What is the deal with that? Oh my.

Mathy, dry, ugly, messy rules. My 2 plays were poor experiences for additional reasons beyond the game (I was tired and played with experienced players, and the little details were elusive enough that they simply told me what I should do and I did it) but nothing about it inspired me to want to play again. Defending the walls each round was soulless, mathy, min/maxing hell.

Seems rather easy from my first session, but only got to round 4, I am sure it will pick up in difficulty from there.

Including the KS exclusive smuggler hero, the add-on arsonist & pickpocket heroes as well as boss meeples.

Sold it.

It's a good solo game, I'd never play this with 4 again.
Basically it's a puzzle, however it didn't strike me as a very interesting / deep one. Add to that an unclear rulebook and plenty of mistakes on the player aids makes me feel that this is undercooked. It's not bad, just very meh for me. In a time where hundreds of 'new' games comes out this one doesn't invite me to make room on the table for it. So I'm very glad I've played a friends copy before buying.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after 2 short games.  Using the revised rules, I did not find this game as confusing as its reputation would lead you to believe.  So far, it seems very hard since games have been lost in the first few turns.  Lots of neat mechanics.  Would prefer to be moving something other than cubes because the cubes get confusing.

RATING: 7
Great cooperative strategy game.  Sharp learning curve mostly because of a poor rule translation and poor instruction layout.  Once you figure it out though there are some really neat aspects such as the game board physically changing as you upgrade your settlement.  Very challenging.  Downside; some aspects are heavily dependent on chance such as who/what is attacking and where, can be too long for some players.

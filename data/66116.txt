Good flicking game.  Innovative box and decent game length.  Not incredibly inventive game play, but it leaves you feeling satisfied.

The second new flicking game I played in the last weeks. IMHO Catacombs is the superior game, although Snapshot can still be silly fun for a while.

Light and fast paced flicking game. Components could be a tad better quality and I have my doubts whether the game is fun after several plays.

I'm a bit of a sucker for dexterity games in a box, so I enjoyed the first few plays of this.   Clever idea, and is fairly quick to play which is a must for a light game like this.

A fairly decent entry in the flicking genre!  Each player has an identical set of goals represented by a deck of cards.  These goals are stuff like hitting another specific player's piece or landing on a certain spot on the board.  The goal of the game is to race through your deck of goals as well as another requirement of obtaining a certain number of gems (obtained by landing on certain board spaces).

In addition to this, there are action spaces on the board that allow you to do special things, like take a bonus turn or move a big blocking stick to hinder your opponents.

Overall, there's a little strategy to it, which is nice for a dexterity game.  The only drawback is that it's one of those games where you have to walk around the table to play... I'd like to play it on a lazy susan.  Also, the board is just plain cool, folding into a contained arena!  Neat-o.

Better than expected flicking game.  Since I don't own Crokinole, this is a nice placeholder for the time being.  Work to achieve your objectives before your opponents achieve theirs, then get back to the home space with exactly the right amount of gems (if you have too many, you have to land on the "dump" space first).  Great fun for the family!

First impression: Not a game for me! Just fingerflicking isn't much fun in my book.

To get the full enjoyment out of this game you have to
pimp it up. First I put the board on a thin sturdy metal
plate and placed this on top of a rotating cheese tray.
Thus all the players can sit in their places and flick to hearts content without having to get up and move around the board. Since I love flicking games (Pitch Car
and Ascending empires) this game was a welcome addition
to this type of game. I actually think people are put off by the fact that they have to move around the board.
As I said easily fixed and this is an exciting race to complete your objectives around the board. Somehow I always win at this game. This must be my destiny in life. "Flick Master Robin."

I love dexterity and flicking games and I REALLY love this one. Aiming for the targets, collecting gems and all the special abilities on the board, along with blocking shots of the other players, all just flows together so well in this game. It;s just an awesome game that everyone who like flicking games should own.

RATING: 7
A chaotic and fun flicking game, where you have goals to meet that will force a lot of player interaction. For example many of the goals involve hitting a specific other player's piece. You'll also have to visit several specific spots on the board, some of which reward you with special actions, such as placing obstacles or getting an extra flick. Simple and amusing. With fewer players, this could be somewhat more skill based, but with more it's quite a riot. The more the merrier as far as I'm concerned.

One of the better flicking games. It is a race to fulfil your goal cards, so everybody has to do the same but in a different order. Plenty of opportunity to interefere with others' plans.

RATING: 5
The rules aren't even too bad, but the game is lifeless and suffers greatly from the complete lack of elegance, both in the components' design and the playability. Could have been much better.

A lot better than I thought it would be.  Very intuitive and lasts just about the right length of time.  I like the obstacles and the goals.  However, owning a Crokinole board, I can't see this ever being a real favorite or classic, as the way the game is constructed (with the barriers) makes it difficult to really make skillful shots.  You also have to have the right kind of table, since you will definitely find yourself standing most of the game so that you can walk over to where you make your shot.

LIKE:

* This flicking game is much more entertaining than say one like Catacombs and is much more simpler to play.
* This game is very portable for a flicking game.
* There is quite a bit of entertainment celebrating great shots and horrendous shots by opponents and crafty placement of the blockade.  
* Game play is simple and quick.
* Plays 6!  I'd even argue the more the merrier!

DISLIKE:

* The clips provided in the game do not hold up the walls of the board well.  
* Wish there was a better set of English instructions available but the game is simple enough that what is available works.

A flicking dexterity game that sort of has a pick up and deliver vibe.  Reminded me of [gameid=14380], although it's quite different, in how it takes flicking and adds a fair amount of strategy.  It can be a bit chaotic at times but it really shines when you pull off a shot that achieves your next goal and blocks your opponent.  I really like that the blocking pieces move around the board too.  Solid silly fun.

Excellent, light-hearted flicking game; colorful and lots of fun, with just a little bit of take-that (moving the dreaded stick) to keep things really interesting. Goes by in a flash: we've often played several games in succession. Perhaps getting close to played out for me. [20 plays; sold]

RATING: 6.66
Snapshot is an honest dexterity game about flipping discs. It's not an ambitious game, it doesn't require you to hurry up; it reminds me of crockinole, but with much more modest components and more diverse action.

There's not a lot to say about it. It is very fast, (there's only a few seconds between your turn and your next), there's interaction and take that in low levels (no ganging up against other players).

My biggest complaint is about the components: they are really subpar.

Overall, it's a fun dexterity game to play from time to time, especially in conventions, or between other games.

Niet iedereens favoriete spel, maar met de juiste groep mensen een genot om te spelen. Knikkeren heb ik altijd al leuk gevonden, dus schieten met schijfjes, daar word ik ook blij van ;-) Carabande is now way, maar dit is leuk omdat je allemaal in hetzelfde gebied zit.

Played twice with 4 players. Very happy that this supports up to 6 players as it should be a nice game with that number. This worked great for our group. Very competitive game with a close finish in both games. With the action spaces and movable obstacles, there is room for creative play. Definitely flicking skills are mandatory as one will occasionally have a difficult shot to make. The components are great except the plastic corner holders do not work very well; probably after some more plays the corners will remain upright better ... I hope.

Fantastic flicking fun. If Pitchcar is an auto race, then Snapshot is more of a demolition derby. The game starts out fairly mellow and inoffensive, but gets progressively better toward the end when people start playing defensively and every shot counts.

Быстрая и продуманная пати-игра от гиковского автора на щелчки. Есть поле, на нём препятствия (палочки, кубики), места с действиями и вражеские шайбы. Необходимо выполнять квесты - дойти до определённой локации щелчками, попасть по противнику, собрать кристаллы. Всего 30 минут, но стратегия и планирование присутствуют вкупе с активной разрядкой.

Минусы - компоненты хороши, но картон нужно каждый раз собирать, поэтому нет ощущения, что игра переживёт 10-20 партий. Впрочем, картон крепится на пластмассе, поэтому будет портится лишь внешний вид. Ну и не 9 или 10, т.к. это всего-лишь хитроумный филлер, которые требует определённой компании и места (в кафе не поиграешь, приходится стоять у стола).

Looks like I should add this to my "games to make some day" list!  [update] Made this game with some card stock--very easy to make.  I've been having a blast so far--it took me a while to make it across the river at first (stupid mercenaries kept chasing me around), but I finally made it south and spent a while recovering.  After hiring a swordsman who got smashed by the troll, I had one gold to my name and no idea where to go.  Luckily, I ran into a wizard and his henchman, who joined me as long as I gave them a fair split of any gold we found.  The wizard also told me about a great treasure five days travel to the south, so I headed that way.  The wizard was turned into smoke by an evil specter on the trip, which was fortunate for me, as I got to pick up his wealth level 60 treasure!  

Just an awesome, awesome game.  I can't believe this much fun was free!

Downloaded and played the Print and Play version.  An enjoyable solitaire adventure with enough difficulty and replayability to keep it fresh. If you enjoyed Escape from the Kingdom of Frome, Escape from Tenopia or any other CYA as a kid, printing and playing Barbarian Prince is highly recommended.

Some folks may not like flipping back and forth through events book - but it reminds me of Choose Your Own Adventures, which I LOVED as a kid. The story really builds a cool narrative (or should I say cool narratives - you're likely to perish horribly sveral times).

I know this is a print and play, but I love the feel of the actual copy I own.

This game is a personal, exclusively solo experience. It sets a classic fantasy mood, characterized by adventure into the unknown. It heavily references charts and tables and is best played patiently and deliberately, rather than when the mood strikes for a quick sword and sorcery romp. Fantastic story-telling game with a manageable print-and-play version.

RATING: 9
pnp- Early in my foray into hobby boardgames and before I had other people to play with I had hours of fun with this silly adventure. You will die. Sometimes you will die RIGHT AWAY. It is a ridiculously random adventure generator. It is incredibly harsh and unforgiving, the poor hapless prince is going to die horribly in multiple sometimes hilarious, sometimes mundane, sometimes infuriatingly frustrating expletive worthy ways. BUT if you play it enough times it will reward you with novel worthy tales of adventure, harrowing excitement, intrigue, amazing escapes, and even romance. It is ultimately solvable, there is a story in there and eventually there is no point in playing as you will always head for the same place on the map. But my 30+ games were some of the most fun I've had in boardgaming, even these years later. Thinking back to it now through the lense of Pandemic Legacy you can see what they were doing back there in the 80s. The convoluted ways of looking up the story paragraphs would never fly these days but ultimately it was sorta(bur not much) like a an old-school implementation of a'legacy' version of the much simplified (draw a card) look-up-a-paragraph mechanic in Above and Below. (They just liked complicated rules in the 80s, it must have felt thematic or something..) (also as an aside BP has something over A&B which is an over reaching narrative)


Doesn't Seafall have some kind of look-up-a-paragraph thing?? 
Isn't the sequel to Above and Below going to be a look-up-a-paragraph legacy story game (complete with narrative)??
Good times these days..

I remember Barbarian Prince much like a good book I read and I think I will feel much the same about Pandemic Legacy. I, for one, say this is where boardgames should go. Fighting Fantasy-ish story games but with all the amazingness of modern design and component sensibilities. How exciting is that!?

Whoa. Sign me UP.

Let's try this.

First couple of plays: the game is ridiculously hard, or I'm terribly incompetent. I realised what mistakes I've been making rules-wise, but it's still quite difficult. I died twice on the first day for my first couple games, and I'm currently experiencing a terrible money shortage. The game seems quite a bit dependent on luck.

Still, an 8, because I'm a sucker for solo adventure games, having grown up with the Greek equivalent of CYOA books.

UPDATE: Oh God, 8 games in and still haven't even broken the 100 GP barrier. I'm seriously bad at this.

Game System - 9
The game system is really creative and allows for some very fun story lines to emerge. It allows a lot of replay-ability since every adventure is going to be different. Even though the system rely's on random dice rolls and charts it still seems to flow and make for believable situations.

Game play - 6
Although the game system is a great the game play is a bit clunky. Having the rules and events split into two different sections and all the different loose charts leads to a lot of flipping back and forth and rechecking your results. It could of been streamlined a bit more.

Game Components - 8.5
I used the available free print to play version to play. For a print and play game I was really impressed with the visuals of all the elements and when I put them all under plexi glass and added a custom barbarian piece it looked really great. 

Fun - 7.2
I really enjoyed seeing the stories of Cal unfold in front of my eyes. You never knew what was going to happen to poor Cal next. that being said the game is very hard and sometimes it can feel like Cal is a poor random traveler and not a mighty Barbarian Prince. Maybe that means I just have to play more and get more positive things to happen to Cal.

Overall - 7.7
It is a fun game that I would like to come back to on occasion and see if Cal can regain his kingdom.

Poor.  It has a certain charm to it, but suffers from a lot of incoherent design decisions that reduce player choice.  Comes from the era where solitaire games were rare and hard to come by, so the designer decided that the best way to ensure you'd get your money's worth was to make it nigh-impossible to win.

This was one of my favorite games when I was younger, largely because it was a solo role-playing game in a board game format.  Someone else commented that the urge to cheat in this game is huge, and I'd have to agree.  The game is very difficult to "win" playing fairly given the high degree of luck involved, but it was still a blast to play at the time.  I doubt I'd pull it out again as there are better alternatives for solo play now.

Print-n-play swords & sorcery adventure game with "choose your adventure" style of play.  Love the retro look of the original, but the redesign reference sheets (here in the BGG files) are also very handy.  Pretty heavily luck based (I won my 2nd game thanks to one good roll), but it's still fun to see what kind of adventures the Barbarian Prince finds himself in each time I play.

A really hard solo adventure, which I enjoy a lot. The game has tons of variety and a really nice vintage  RPG feel to it. The casualty rate of Barbarian Princes brings roguelikes to mind, some people hate dying  a lot, others find allure in the special feel of success attained in constant mortal danger. 

If you belong to the latter group and don´t mind some clunkiness in game mechanics this is a free solo game tailor made for you.

Owned this once-upon a time, now have the P&P version.  Truly, a classic, taking the Choose Your Own Adventure from children's books and putting them into game format.  Not entirely original, as some of those CYOA books included simple game rules, but larger in scope than any CYOA book could hope to be.

While those books eventually ran out of re-readability, Barbarian Price never does.  Sure, you can only encounter the Dwarf so many times before it gets old...but how many games can boast of the following different endings:  Eaten by a Dragon;  ton apart by a pack of wolves; travel back in time, only to be defeated by the same bandit party you killed the first time around; whisked away into limbo by a spectre; fall in love with a temple priestess, only to be killed by goblins.

I borrowed a copy of this and ran several times through when I was a teenager.  At the time I thought that it was the best thing in story games, but I didn't like the randomness and the lack of tactical control for combat.  A bit too abstract for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clunky, but simple, early 1980's rules, that are extremely luck based.  And the game is so brutal it was made for masochists. You think this is the story of a heroic Conan type character, but it's mostly about a guy getting kicked around by a cruel, horrible world.  That said, it generates some very rich, albeit depressing, narrative. And the system - clunky as it is - is quite an achievement.

So, I definitely enjoyed this one quite a lot. Enough so that I wrote a session report for my second game:

I'm not normally one to PnP stuff, but this one requires no chits and counters, so minimal skill and investment required, and I seem to be going through an 80's nostalgia period in my life, so it didn't take much for me to bite.

Nice idea: a big choose-your-own-adventure book in a fantasy setting.
But it really deosn't work. The old adventure-books were evolving stories, Barbarian Prince is just a collection of random events. 
Luck is crucial, but it wouldn't be a big problem (you expect it in this sort of games) if it wasn't coupled with total lack of balance (encounters do not scale as you progress; e.g. they're way too hard in the early turns) and poor narrative (the entries are mostly a collection of tables and reference to other paragraph of rules).
Simply outdated. It's free, yet not worth the papaer you would waste to print it.
If you want a solo fantasy adventure, go for a videogame (or one of the more modern boardgames covering that niche).

This game is a hoot.

My first play involved a few days stumbling around in the woods starving because I didn't catch that hunting could happen on a day you also did something, followed by a week or so imprisoned by reclusive monks whose hidden temple I'd violated, followed by a few days lost in the desert trying to find some ruins -- which, once I found them, proved (thanks to a lucky roll) to contain 500 gold, the exact amount needed to win the game.

I can't wait to play it again! From everything I've heard about its difficulty, I should expect to spend all subsequent plays starving in the woods while being stabbed by orcs, IE playing Outdoor Survival (with orcs). Whatever the case, I can see how every play would be different, fairly random, and entertaining.

I love that there's a legal print and play option available. This was my first PNP, and a few bucks at Kinkos produced two bound booklets, a laminated 11x17 map, and a laminated character tracker that all work nicely in play.

Hey, this was pretty fun!  I got slammed in my first and second games: some guards roughed me up, beaten on by ghosts, and finally done in fighting three robbers.  The second game, I basically committed suicide attacking 14 guards with no time left.  I couldn't find rules for poison when I was bitten by spiders: what happens?  Third game I managed a win, very early on.

The range of experiences in this game is what makes it great.  One game I'm penniless, starving, unable to cross a river for the life of me, and finally (and mercifully) torn apart by a pack of wolves.  The next game, I have a gang of elf allies, fall in love with some lord's daughter and am cruising around on a Pegasus.  It's most always the former, but those rare occasions where it all goes right are sublime and keep me coming back.  Not a game you play to win.  Should play this more than I do.

The decisions you make have no effect on your chances of winning.  It's ALMOST as bad as, "Event e78: If you choose to go east, see event e193. If you go west, see event e178."  "Event e193: You walked over a cliff.  You're dead." "Event e178: You stumble across a cache of 500 gold pieces. You've won!" I found the game way too annoying to play it a fifth time, but the map is cool, and the system has some potential.

My-oh-my, like others, this one does bring back memories!  Lost the game during a move around 1986, but can remember getting one of my great ex-girlfriends to play it regularly.  It's a solitaire game, but enjoyable when a friend handles the story-book.   She even painted a female Barbarian Princess for herself.   It was difficult to win as I recall, with the random events playing a great role in success (or failure).   Would buy again if I could find it.

roll: 3 => start in ruins of Jakors' keep
action: search ruins

Moral: do not search ruins early

So I had no idea that this had been redone as a Print and Play. I had a production copy in the early 80's and the game saw a lot of table time. Basically it is Dungeons and Dragons for one, which is why it got so much table time. AD&D also got a lot of my time but I did not always have a group and this could be left up in my room. Looking forward to getting back into this soon. Just completed putting it together. Might have to do something about some custom counters. Text only counters, while true to the original, are kind of boring.

Barbarian Prince is a small solitaire adventure that is equal parts board game, role playing game, and a choose your own adventure book.  The vibe is cool and the little hex map is nifty. 

Be warned: There is a lot of bookkeeping here for a board game. Food, weight, endurance (hit points), additional NPCs, and the regular adjustments to the character stats give it an RPG vibe. Battles can be less fun however--early on I got into a super long combat situation (with my wandering monk at my side) against a regenerative troll that was about 10+ minutes of rolling the same miniature six-sided dice with modifiers changing once or twice every round as the troll healed over his halfway endurance level and was cut down again below it and he healed above it, etc. Lengthy dice rolling of wholly abstracted battles is a bit of a hurdle for me: I tend to dig lengthy battles with lots of detail (Ambush! excels here), massive scale battles with midlevel detail (D-Day at Omaha Beach) or merciless, wholly abstracted battles (Cave Evil and Blood Rage). So 10+ minutes was too much combat for a single combat that had no actual battle detail other than gaining or losing a point or two.

I do like the exploration here. That's a strength. (Though the travel flow seems wonky in that your "event" when you are "lost" takes place in the hex that you have not yet been allowed to find/enter. Huh...?)  Still, like the justly praised Mage Knight, traveling and defeating anything in combat in this world are accomplishments and the small board grows larger and deeper the longer you play.

Nice! It´s like a more detailed version of the game books of the 80s (like Lone Wolf). The rules are a bit cumbersome but not overly complicated.Very hard to beat. My record of three plays: Got turned into a toad in week three with 1 Gold, Killed by a band of Goblins in Week one with 2 Gold and (my greatest deed!!!) taken into another plane by a spectre in week four with 52 Gold. Sounds depressing? No, it´s fun actually. :-)Definitly worth it! Download it now!

Update 07/09/2006: I MADE IT! I MADE IT! 500 f****ing Goldpieces!!! YES!!! Ok, ok...I was very lucky and just found 500 Gold lying around in the treasure room of a ruin I found south of the Temple in HEX 0711 on day 3 of week 6. But I never before even survived that long and 500 Gold is 500 Gold, right?
The vilest thing I´ve seen in my travels? In the north of the land I found a community of Halflings that obviously made their money as slavers! So much for nice, stout fellows...

A tough, but fun, adventure. It's a fairly simple game, and the rules can be learned as you play once you get the basic mechanics down. The events booklet does a nice job of weaving together a tale rather than simply "move here and fight." Leading Cal Arath on his quest for vengeance isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon, although I doubt this will hit the table more than a few times a year.

Nice idea: a big choose-your-own-adventure book in a fantasy setting.
But it really deosn't work. The old adventure-books were evolving stories, Barbarian Prince is just a collection of random events. 
Luck is crucial, but it wouldn't be a big problem (you expect it in this sort of games) if it wasn't coupled with total lack of balance (encounters do not scale as you progress; e.g. they're way too hard in the early turns) and poor narrative (the entries are mostly a collection of tables and reference to other paragraph of rules).
Simply outdated. It's free, yet not worth the papaer you would waste to print it.
If you want a solo fantasy adventure, go for a videogame (or one of the more modern boardgames covering that niche).

One play, after my first move to the south, I got eaten by wolves...

I need to play more to have an opinion, seems to be quite random.

Updated after second play. Now I managed to wander over three weeks without much happening. Then bunch of the constables almost beat me to the death, before I could escape them. While resting in the countryside, the wolves came again in the middle of the night and finished me.

It felt better after the second play, but during the three weeks there was pretty much nothing which could have moved me closer to the victory and usually nothing happened. The battles seem to be quite hard. May be next time I manage to get a companion and something positive might happen.

Third play lasted a little bit over two weeks, one hard fight, from which I escaped. I traveled alone, not much happened until I had a hunting accident and died. Not really progress considering the victory condition.

Great content with tons of events and combat and turns and twists. You never know what is going to happen just around the next hex, with a creative and fun narrative that goes with it. Two major complaints 1) very poor mechanical management, i.e. it is not originally designed to make it convenient for the player to keep track of everything which breaks up the flow of the game 2) LOTs of randomness, though you do get to choose how you react to situations, the combat would greatly benefit from a more fluid design and one with more options other than just roll the dice. I find this game inspiring as the events create an interesting world and makes me wish it was incorporated into a smoother game system. I feel like the potential for greatness is here beneath the twisting ways of poor user interface.

RATING: 6
Given its size, this is obviously a game just for 18xx fanatics. I am one of those.  But despite the beautiful production values and some innovations, 18OE disappointed me. This game takes two hours just to get rolling, mainly because you first must dispose of a huge opening packet and then float 12 minors and potentially a bunch of regionals.  All in all, I didn't feel like I got enough bang per hour.  I would try again, maybe, but only via Dropbox.  

The rules also seem unnecessarily convoluted and organized in a strange way based on interlocking Railroad Phases and Train Phases, plus of course the standard Stock Rounds and Operating Rounds.  I think the rules are going to be rough going even for seasoned 18xx players.

Played about half of a game of the prototype last night.  Really enjoyed my play.   There's definitely a lot going on in this game.  You need to put a good amount of thought into the initial auction as it sets up the entire game. 

Only issue is the extended playtime.  While I enjoyed playing the game.  I don't know if I'd be up for playing it very often, but I'd definitely play it again.

My second favorite 18xx.

1861 is great as well.

My primary experience with 18xx are games with a little less 'bite' to them in terms of trashing your opponent's stock, etc.

Picked up my pre-order today, and the components are beautiful.  Top notch quality.  I'm very impressed, much more than I was expecting.  Upped my rating 1 level based upon the components.

6/21/13

Comments are based on the prototype version which was played the prototype version at the 18xx PDX con. Incomplete (5hr) play of one of the scenarios (shorter games).

First: I've preordered a set via kickstarter, so that should tell you what the bottom line is.  There's a lot going on here, and many nuances are different than other 18xx games.  This is not simply 18xx on a larger map.  I think that right now, this is a little beyond my skill level, it will take several plays for me to feel like I know how to play well.  I think the complexity is aimed at experienced 18xx players.  I am looking forward to going up the learning curve.

Some differences are ferries and sea routes.  Additionally there are some hexes with double dits, and bonuses for being the first to reach certain tiles.

Because the map area is larger, the hexes and tiles are smaller than what I'd like.

One of the nice things is that there are multiple scenarios for playing less than the full game.

UPDATE - [10.15.15] rating decrease of .2.  No reason other than I like other 18xx games more than this one.
Can't wait to try this giant.

[6.15.15] Since March ('15) I have been able to get 1.5 full plays in and a medium scenario (Prussia, Russia, AH). The full plays have been via Cyberboard and the Scenario was F2F (finishing via Cyberboard).  I have to really appreciate how wonderfully designed this game is.   If I like 1817 because of the diverse array of stock/financial manipulations that are available at a player's disposal, I like 18OE for the same caliber of choices, but on the operations end of the spectrum.  Essentially, run your companies well, and you will win.  This game really rewards the player who can optimally time all of their choices.  (e.g. When to convert train companies from regional, to major, to national; When to merge minors into majors, etc.)  After playing the scenario, my hat is off to Mark F. and Ed S. for designing a game that feels like you're playing completely different games depending on whether you're playing the full game (which gives one game experience) versus playing a scenario (even though the rules are the same, feels like a completely different game).  The other thing is how the auctioning of the opening packets causes the beginning of the game to be set up differently every different time (e.g. which regionals start the game; starting position of minors; the difference between each player's suite of regionals and minors both in which one's people own and the ration of regionals to minors owned by each player.  In one game everyone started with 4 regionals and 3 minors.  In the next game two players had 4 regionals and 3 minors.  One player had 5 regionals and 2 minors, and another player had 3 regionals and 4 minors!)

[5.12.15]Currently finishing 3rd full length play via Cyberboard.  I down graded this game to a 9.2, but after this play the rating will be going up.  I'm beginning to enjoy (still not understand/master) the subtleties of this game.  The auction between the privates, minor companies (all with their own special powers, and regional companies (all with unique starting positions on the board) is a game all within itself.  Trying to manage the spending of the money on selecting companies from each type that work together, and the claiming tactical starting cities for each minor on the game board, and parring each regional company in a way provides an economic advantage at the onset of the game is an enjoyable challenge.  Flat out, this is a game that rewards operating companies well more than anything else.

[6.18.14] - Two games in session (F2F and Cyberboard).  The scope and execution of this 18xx masterpiece is a must-try/have for any 18xx fan.  More thoughts when the F2F game finishes.

There was enough present (in the prototype I played) that I disliked, it is unlikely I will play it again.

In broad, I enjoy 2-hour stock rounds.  I do not enjoy 2-hour operating rounds.

EDIT:

Per request, I will attempt to flesh this out slightly:

Keep in mind that this was my first experience (~half a game) both with 18OE and with the group playing it (Kublacon weekend).

I paint broad strokes as a result, largely due to my inability after half a game to nail down exactly what I thought was positive and negative about the game, at the risk of indicating something only 90% correct, and being fully rebuked for the other 10%.

I enjoyed the minors, and the special powers that fold in.

There were two aspects I disliked, again in broad strokes:

-There were some map issues with dits and cities in central Europe that I disliked (hard to nail down) - it seemed that there was little choice in route development.  That may have since been changed.

-The minors/majors/nationals became available in such a way that there would always be around 25 companies available.  Beyond the first or second OR set, they began quickly interfering with one another, such that running in parallel became a rarity.  Unlike 18C2C, the company count is always rather high, and so this leads to what I believe will always be long ORs.

I will also add the caveat that I don't like 18EU (although I prefer maps of Europe over the US, and I definitely liked this more than 18EU).  I don't recall having any disquiet that the game would be completely boring/stagnant (like 18EU) in the last few OR sets.

My personal opinion is that I am unlikely to play this one again, as for the time commitment required, I would rather play 18C2C.

RATING: 7
A solid 18XX that can vary from epic (12 hours) to medium (4 - 6 hour) length. Other than the beginning of the game, the mechanics are straightforward and easy to get. In this sense, it feels like 18EU. Most of the important decisions are made early. However, with the fast pace of the game (ironic considering how long it is), there was only a little bit that felt like turning the crank. 

Interesting points:
1. All Railroads are started at the beginning of the game. Decision points afterwards are limited to growing up from 4-share to 10-share and decision whether or not to nationalize. 4-shares are limited to one country. 10-share majors can go anywhere and national RRs are limited to one country.
2. RRs get "track points" which determine the amount of tiles they can lay. This lets the board build quickly.
3. Only green Ys (available with the first 3T) add an additional hole. Coupled with relaxed track and a lot of tiles, the board feels mostly stable by late in the 3Ts.
4. When a company is nationalized, it loses its treasury and tokens and gets rusted trains for free. It can buy trains from other companies for half price and it holds one train more than majors. Most importantly it is limited to running in a single country. Early on it pays well, but later the best majors pay much better.
5. Ports allow travel over seas and oceans at the cost of reducing number of cities to be limited. Interesting but not hugely different.
6. Incremental capitalization. Lots of tokens make quick token placement important.
7. Minor/Regional operational order depend on when they start not par price.

Little chance we will play this again. It just takes too much effort and the pay off isn't there. Took us 10 hours for our first full play, but running 10 companies each is just a bit too much work.

Overwrought “run good companies” title for 18xx newbies who want think that they are exploring the limits of the genre. Also, sessions with fewer than four players are far too shallow to convey any sense of the game. If you want a real experience, play 1817.

Although this is a big game, it plays faster than you might think.  In my first play (the full game scenario with the preset start packets for 4) it took us 5 hours to get through to the 4Ts, after which we had to stop, but I think we were halfway there.  We'd play faster next time.

The game has a lot of interesting options---it doesn't straitjacket you.  The designer and developer have also made some good choices to speed play (one example is the simple double dits; another is the track point system for building.)

So long.  I like an epic experience like this maybe once a year, but that epicness usually comes at the cost of expanding the parts of 18xx that don't interest me.  I'd rather just play 1 big tile than search for 3 yellow tiles on my turn, for example.

I am very grumpy by the end.  This is a game of stamina.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

2016: Okay, having played the full game... I'm underwhelmed. The ease of building bypasses irritates me on a gameplay level (tokens are less important than I would hope), running a 3-train from Paris or Berlin to Constantinople irritates me on a thematic level, the tiny hexes irritate me on a physical level though I understand why they're required, and if I'm gonna take all day to play something I'd rather it were 1817.

The smaller scenarios may be more my thing. Or maybe not; there's still the small-hexes issue and a non-trivial rules overhead.

My main complaint, I think, is that for such a big board and so much time spent in ORs, the ease of building bypasses makes the board play uninteresting after the early stages.

2015: Big. Definitely big. Will take at least a couple of plays before I can tell whether/how much I like it. Initial impressions are favorable.

RATING: 7.5
This game didn't make much of an impression on me honestly. There was some interesting stuff with the National vs Major companies and how the former is a better moneymaker medium term but the latter has the real late game potential. But when I was playing I felt like most of the decisions I was making were about track laying, and those to me are some of the less interesting decisions among 18xx games. This is also the game that made me realize some sort of computer implementation would save a ton of time in operating rounds without losing anything. But don't get me wrong, it was reasonably fun, just near the bottom of 18xx I've played.

full game is just too much damn downtime in ORs.  I could imagine it being OK if players would take 1 or 2 minutes per company, but when it's more like 5-10, you have 18 companies of which you might control 2 or 3 so that's going to be potentially hours between when you get to do anything.  I want to like the game but I simply do not have the patience for that.

The components are good. I hate the small bits, but my wife liked that it fit on one large table. Each player also needs a TV tray stand for their stuff...

We had a great five Person session today, but after seven hours just got to the start of merging.

What is neat about the game, which is totally different than other 18xx I have played, are the minors. These twelve RRs can start in any city, up to two per region. Since they run a train, and will eventually get merged, I don't see how two games will be the same. 

The patronage tiles also allow for variability. As you put out a demon of like thirty that randomization where RRs will attempt to drive to early aft the big dollar cities go.

In our first game england and north France were making great bucks, followed by Germany, then north italy and Spain, Russia. Australia and Scandanavia were dogs...

Can't wait to play again!


-----------------------------

We have since played several of the scenarios two player included with the game.  Based on them i have decided to raise the rating to a 9.

This is simply one of the best games of all times. There are a couple of rules that are strange, like swapping tokens a ross the board, but we ignore rules we dont n like as a group, especially when they dont make sense.

The only real weaknesses of the game are complexity, and length. I might have to make an even shorter set of rules for a small group to play.

If you dont have ths game, get it! Your group really does need to experience it, as IMHO it is the best 18xx type game out there.

I got to play 18OE at a convention.  I did not aspire to play 18OE - it is a huge game, and I tend to want to play smaller affairs.  But my friends were keen to try it, and so I agreed.  I had a lot of fun.

The game is giant.  We used two banquet tables pushed together.  We played a medium scenario, where Britain, France and Prussia (and various adjacent assorted areas) were the playing area.  We placed the stock chart over Russia, leaving St. Petersburg acessible, as this was the furthest east off board location used.

The hexes are smaller than other 18xx games.  This is mostly a good thing, or the game would have been even larger!  My only quibble with the small hexes was being able to read them.  Since the game sat spread over two tables, I had trouble reading the small print with my older eyes.  I think they could have at least made the off board location payoffs a bit larger and easier to read.  But this is a quibble.  Overall the hexes are functional and well made.

Due to the size of the board, I ended up sitting out of reach of the track tiles.  So I needed to constantly walk around the table to select tiles.  This made for a much more active game than usual.  Also, we played at a convention.  This is a game that commands attention.  We had a steady stream of observers who came over to see our game.  So I had to dodge around people a lot during the play of the game.  I was sitting at the east side of the world.  To get to the tiles I generally had to walk around the north and west sides.  I found it slightly confusing to refocus on the area I was concerned about from the two different angles.

So from a human perspective, this was a more difficult game to play than the usual 18xx game.  I stood a lot more, I had to walk around a lot more and the convention setting provided lots mre interruptions.  I didn't mind any of this, except when large numbers of people stood between me and the hex tiles.

There are private companies, minor companies, regional companies, major companies and nationalized companies.  So there are a fair number of rules to get your arms around.  None of these are especially difficult.  I was pleased with the quality of the tokens and the mats/certificates for these companies.  

Our rules overhead ran for over an hour, maybe 90 minutes.  We played the game for roughly 7 hours.  We did not play it out, but came very close.  We conceeded the game to one of the players as he was clearly going to win.  We likely had 1 SR and the final OR's to do.  I suspect that would have taken another 1-2 hours to finish.  I suspect that an experienced core group (of 4) not playing at a convention could finish a medium scenario in about the same time it takes to play 1830.

The game demands a very large table.  If you are considering buying this game, consider if you have a table big enough to play it upon!

The game offers small, medium and full game scenarios.  While expensive, I see a lot of value in this set.

Recommended.

I bought this game.  I never expected to want it - it looked so monstrously big when I first saw it.  But after one play, my will crumbled.

EDIT: I've now played a second time.  This time on a small scenario.  Explaining the game took a bit over an hour.  We then played (3p) for about 6 hours.  We had a s number of rule questions, which I attempted to answer, but still needed a fair bit of time flipping through the rules.

I think the small scenarios really ought to be about a 5 hour game, which seems reasonable to me for 18xx.  Even a single panel small game is a sprawling affair.  I believe I can handle a medium scenario with both panels out.  But it will be tight on my table, even with laying the stock panel over the unused portion of the map.  The full game doesn't really appeal to me as much as the smaller scenarios and the medium scenarios.

RATING: 3
(TL;DR Version:  This game is too big for the 18XX system, and it results in some very serious problems which remove almost all of the challenge out of the gameplay.  Not recommended for 18XX enthusiasts).

Wow, I was quite disappointed by 18OE, unfortunately.

Some background - I've been an avid player of 18XX titles for quite some time.  Favourites of mine include 1830 and 1856, though I find almost all the 18XX games enjoyable on some level.

Let's talk briefly about the hallmarks of an 18XX game, then move on to why 18OE just doesn't measure up. 

An 18XX game should have tense decisions, tight money (at times at least), the chance for a company to perform poorly and, of course, the potential to have said company dumped onto another player for them to sort out. 

18OE lacks in ALL of these areas, and quite honestly it's a bit of a puzzle why, other than a few basic rules similarities, it's even in the 18XX family.

First, there are no tense decisions.   Get denied a route or city?  No problem, there are literally dozens or other cities to connect to that pay just as well, or ways to get that same route by re-routing.  Get worked into a corner with poor rail placement?  No problem!  There are routes which go over the water, and so no rail placement is ever truly poor.  This has the effect of making companies very similar to each other, and there are no problems which cannot be solved easily... very easily. 

Money is MUCH too easy to come by.  Whereas in most 18XX titles (the good ones, at least) you might have some nail-biting moments where your company decides to pay out despite needing a train desperately, in 18OE money flows freely.  In the course of 3 operating rounds, for example, one company experienced payouts of 90, 190, and 660 respectively!   But the worse part is that's not an exception, most of the companies in the game experienced similar increases in payouts, meaning both players and companies were soaking in cash.   18OE balloons out of control very quickly, and by 1/3rd of the way through the game you'll be reduced to making enormous calculations of routes with each company's action.   One turn your company will be making X, and a turn our two later it will be 2X or 3X.  

Putting this system to the test, I had my company plow ahead and purchase unnecessary trains in order to cause older trains to rust (normally this causes a shockwave of panic), but this was only enough to cause payments a minor one-turn setback as companies dug into their pockets to replace the outgoing trains.  Two operating rounds later, it was as if no disruption had taken place at all.

The concept of National-level trains is brilliant in theory, and terrible in concept.  Their ease of play makes it very easy for them to turn a profit, but what's worse, their formation creates a "vacuum" of sorts where all of their stations being removed allows all nearby Major companies to thrive.  This just pumps more money into the system as now the National and the nearby Majors are no longer competing with each other.

Despite having two players who were completely new to the 18XX series, there was not a single opportunity to "dump" a company onto a hapless victim.  All companies thrived... and that may be fun for a short while, but it's not what the 18XX series is all about, and quite frankly it's boring too.

So, here's the main problem:  18OE is too big for the 18XX system. There are too many viable routes, and this results in all companies succeeding, which removes the challenge of the 18XX system completely.   The concept of the "over-water" routes is interesting in theory, but it makes the problem worse - there are no bad track builds in 18OE, no matter how poor you play. 

I did like the simple building points method and the track rights mechanic, so it wasn't a 100% negative experience.  Plus, the game does function (i.e. it is not "broken").  However, I should caution the reader that for a game of this length these are just not enough for me to recommend playing it.

18OE is a rules-heavy game that takes a long time and doesn't do anything better than other 18XX games.  In fact, it does a lot of things worse and just takes 5-10 times longer than its cousins.  I would go so far as to suggest that the game is so forgiving that it doesn't even belong in the 18XX family.  

In a 6-player game, all 6 players agreed with most of the above points.

I'm unsure of how to rate this game. It's extremely long yet fairly "simple" for how ridiculously large this game is. It almost feels like a long and more complex version of 18EU. I'm enjoying my play of it, but this would have to be a once in a while game. I'm still interested in the "short" scenarios, but I just wanted to play 18EU most of the time while I was playing this. I felt the beginning was interesting, the middle was pretty meh until we started to form nationals, than it dragged on at the end. Far too much upgrading for literally every company and constantly recalculating the run values.

I really wasn't a fan of the 1+ hour OR's. Each OR took anywhere from 45-75 minutes...for one. It's just too damn long for me. I like a mix of stock rounds and OR's, not 90% OR and 10% Stock Round. 

I didn't like the color choice for the "yellow" tiles. Yes, they are easy to tell apart when other tiles are on the board, but it's too much of a yellow green which is annoying.

Also, I may not be a fan of big map games. Personally I like the tighter more restrained maps of 1846 or 18MEX. This map just felt really large even if you are artificially restrained.

All in all, I'd be willing to play it again, but it's just too long for what it was to me.

[b]Update[/b]: After playing a Medium length scenario, the game is probably a 5 for me. It felt like the full game, but in a much more manageable package. Still too long, but would probably be rated a 5 or 6 for me. Still want to try a short scenario which would probably be closer to a 6 or 7 for me.

[b]Update 2[/b]: Alright, after another full game play, I bumped it back up a couple points. I do think the full game can drag at times due to how many companies are running, but it's not nearly as bad as I remember it being. Familiarity with the rules drastically speeds up the game. It was still a full 12 hours, but it didn't feel like it was that long. I still prefer the shorter scenarios, but the longer one I would play every 3-12 months.

[b]Update 3[/b]: After playing the Short scenario with the missus, I have taken away a much better appreciation for the game. It's quicker, far more manageable and you get the full flavor of the game. Yes, you're only running 1/3 of the companies, but you're also playing the game in 1/4 of the time. Great fun, best 2 player 18xx I own.

Much more fun than I expected! I was expecting a game that was about to collapse under itself with chrome (almost like 1831), but 18OE is quite straightforward and accessible, especially with the short scenarios.

I prefer 18xx games that are all about capital management. This one is all about route building; this game offers the *best* tie laying rules!

The beginning of the game felt more like an elaborate setup phase. By mid-game, though, all the companies were almost sold out, and it felt like the end game would be a total letdown (like so many 18xx titles). However, we forgot about the nationalization option, which would have changed everything.

Behemoth of a game. The scope is massive, even if playing in two or three countries. The one downside to this game is the fairly static stock market. Not much happened up there as the game was mainly about setting up a great initial company and seeing what happens (sandbox?).

--Apr2014-- Very cool (after one play of a short scenario.)  Loads to think about; impressive dynamics.  My rating could increase.

Finally got to play the full game.  I had played a scenario last year and did not really appreciate it so I wasn't expecting much from the full game.  I did enjoy it a lot more than the scenario, but the things which make the game work also make it somewhat bland.  Even if you completely mismanage a company you can convert it to a national when trains rust (when the 4, 6, or 8 is bought).  The track laying system which allows you to put down 3, 6, or 9 points of track makes it really easy to build around blocking tokens but also often leads to AP when trying to figure out how to use up all of your track laying points.

I do really like the minors as there are a lot of them and each one can start on any open city on the board (with the limit of only 2 minors per region) so it seems the board will always be a little bit different each game.  Not a lot of danger in the game though, but for a game which takes 12 to 18 hours I suppose that is a good thing.

After 5 plays, I like the game, but by the time you get to the 5 train it has always been obvious who was eventually going to win assuming reasonable decent play for the remainder of the game.  The game is just a economic snowball effect and the first player to max out their share holdings with good companies is going to win but there is still a good 6 hours of play after that point.  The decisions are still interesting but I prefer games more like 1817 where it is much more difficult to evaluate  relative player positions in the mid game.

Epic game that really tells a story. Despite its length, I feel fully engaged for the whole thing. My brain is a puddle of mush afterwards. 
Played 1 teaching "medium" scenario (11hrs) and 1 full game (16hrs) so far. Just starting up an online game with the folks from my full session now.

(x)What a beast, the only thing that keeps it from a 10 is the rules and the lack of index in the rules.

The biggest map ever, with of cource shortest scenarios to play in 5h instead 12 or more. Amazing roules and a lot of companies...
All you need to have the best experience in this kind of game is here!

Not full score just for tokens, too light for me but just functional.

I sort of like 18OE but its size is both a curse and one of its major strength. I've played it twice and I find it difficult to see how I'm going to get to play it again.

The biggest 18xx I have played. Starting auction can make a big difference in the results. End of game is odd, as trains can jump from anywhere to Constantinople. E.g. New York-Hamburg-Berlin-Constantinople.

A gargantuan 18xx. Not for the faint of heart or the short of time.

I've played it 15+ times so far - the campaign with 5 players and all of the scenarios with 2-4 players, mostly with 2. 

Great 18xx game, even with 2 players.

RATING: 8.5
Definitely the nicest looking 18XX game. Very long and expansive, even in the shorter scenarios, but really gives you the opportunity to lay awesome routes and build amazing companies.

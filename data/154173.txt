Essen 2015 - 7 samurai battle a band of renegade ninja on behalf of a small Japanese village. Whats not to like in that scenario? Fast and furious gameplay with enough variety to make it repayable. The samurai are more fun to play.

RATING: 5.5
Very brisk 2-player out-guessing game. Hidden placement and interesting strategy on both asymmetric sides. The production is quite good - although the ninja throwing stars are absurdly tiny. Of course I love the theme! But there are many fiddly aspects to it as well. The rules are delicate and broad - 10 areas and 7 ronin each with a special ability. This makes for interesting out thinking, but also prone to mistakes and paralysis in placement, dampening enjoyment. This probably also invites further plays to tune up skills. However, lacking a dedicated opponents, this game will soon leave my collection.

Brian and I finished up Friday game night with this 2 player double guessing game. I played the Ronin. As the Ronin player, you have to really know your special powers and the location powers to be effective. Brian was able to take over 5 areas in turn 6 as I had 3 of my guys dead. This is really fun. I will teach this to Brett as I think he will really like it. Flo, probably not.

RATING: 7
Nice hidden action-selection game marred by atrocious/tiny/broken ninja tokens and poorly thought out box, board & character mat design. It's not the most intuitive game at first and it took me a couple of play-throughs to grasp it all. I have seen people say its balanced in favour of the ronin, although the opposite has been true in my experience - that could mean the game is well balanced overall but I still think it's much harder work for the ronin player. Ninjas have won every time. Recommended for fans of bluffing games such as Sun Tzu, Raptor and maybe even Lord if the Rings Confrontation.

Neat 2-player samurai versus ninja game. I like the 2 asymmetrical factions and how each player gets a turn to be each faction. Plays very quickly so this simple game doesn't overstay its welcome. My biggest issue with the game is the graphic design: when secretly placing my tokens, I found myself constantly looking at the main map to see the abilities of each area for ninjas. I wish it had been also included on the smaller maps. Nothing fancy but a nice, simple game for 2 players with a cool theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Slick little two player bluffing/double think game. It captures the drama and thrills of Seven Samurai quite well as you plot hidden deployment and then reveal, hoping to outwit your opponent and overwhelm (or protect).

Simple, asymmetrical, and clever.

There's not much to this game, and it can sometimes feel like you're grasping in the dark for a strategy. But 7 Ronin has moments of deep cunning when you figure out the ideal way to implement your Samurai/Village Area Abilities. I enjoy pulling this out for a quick game that is easy and satisfying.

I bought the game because of the subject, I am a huge fan of the movie this is loosely based off of. I am also a fan of abstracts, especially when the theme that is overlaid works. Combine that with a 30 min playtime and it is a solid winner for me. You're always trying to guess where your opponent goes to prevent them from taking advantage of their special abilities but still trying to keep your objectives in mind. A tense and well balanced asymmetrical game is also something of note. On the wider scale, it is an average game, but for me since it does hit on so many elements that I find interesting it is a keeper for me.

Basically Seven Samurai: The Board Game, this is a brilliantly designed asymmetric 2 player game where the ninja are trying to control 5 village areas and the samurai are trying to defend against them. Wonderfully thematic and fun! The ninja have won a few times with some surprising moves, so it's a game where either side can win. I'm not sure about the replayability...especially with the same two players...you start to learn and adapt to each others' tricks so I fear that if we play it too often it might become stale or scripted. For now we love it. One of my best purchases of 2015!

Very interesting game for 2 players, with a grat climate took directly from Akira Kurosawa movies. 7 ronin vs 40 ninja warriors fighing for death and life in the mountaing village. EPIC.

A fiddly bluffing game without a ton of information to work with. Mostly, though, the game is infuriating because the game's information is presented so impenatrably; maybe I'd figure it out after a few plays, but there's nothing calling me back.

RATING: 5
A clean and neat game of bluff and outguessing your opponent. No randomness means that everything depends on your decisions and on the actions of the other player. I like games with this level of bluff so I enjoyed playing '7 Ronin' but there was something missing.

All in all it was a pleasant experience that left me rather cold and I can't recall any special treats of this game that make it stand out.

If you're a fan of this type of games, it's definitely worth playing. And maybe it'll push the right buttons. That wasn't my case.

I'm not very fond of two-player games that, in essence, consist of secretly deploying troops and outguessing your opponent, but I wouldn't mind playing this again. The multitude of special powers can be overwhelming at first, but they are not difficult to remember after one or two plays. They allow the use of some tactics and really make the game. My biggest gripe is with the decent but very basic production, with a very small board and one terrible choice in components: tiny death stars that hurt the players' fingers.

A very good but very underrated game, 7 Ronin is a quick two-player strategy game (+/- 30 minutes) with great replay value.  One side plays the ronin defending the village with special skills, and the other plays the ninja who try to use the abilities of the different village areas to take majority control.  Players place their pieces behind screens, reveal, and resolve the actions which result.  A strategic yet thematic game, the board, pieces, and tiles combine with gameplay to provide a true attacker/defender experience that feels samurai-ish.  While I wish the ninja pieces had been made a little bigger, it's a minor shortcoming compared to the overall quality of the game.  I can think of very few such small games which have as high a replay factor.

Asymmetrical hidden area control game. The objective is to hold the village for 8 rounds as the Ronin or get 5/10 areas under control for the Ninja. The Ronin definitely have the advantage, and will win the vast majority of the time; however, the mind games are great and the challenge make you want to play again and again.

Really really like this one... it's a 2P game with asymmetrical powers and a very different way of playing.

I came out of it with a felling of a [b][thing=179460][/thing][/b] light...
One player is trying to invade the village and the other is defending it.

Of course this is much lighter but the feeling is there and it's also much much faster!

Trying to get into the head of the opponent, where will he go and what Ronin will he use, or where will the Ninjas try to enter and how many will come that way.

Was very impressed by it and can't wait for the next version that's supposed to come out in the future.

The defending side has to place all of the defenders in different regions and the ninjas are trying to make majorities over the regions. It has a nice feeling and it is VERY difficult to be the defenders. I look forward to playing this one more to try and actually win. Only played the one time so far.

7 Samurai - The Game.

Very good game that takes on a theme in the likes of Kurosawa's 7 Samurai (more like "13 Warriors" I think). It is, however, mostly a deduction game and it's really good at that.

The tiny little shurikens (they are indeed too little) can be easily substituted by cubes or something else (even dice).

A well done second guessing game that is tense and doesn't waste your time.  Every decision matters because the game is short and both players are strained on resources.  However, there still manages to be some strategic arc of the game from when the ronin are kicking all kinds of ass, so when they start to die and worry they cannot hold, to when they realize the ninja are dying from the winter and they just need to last one more turn.

There is certainly randomness from second guessing, but there is no pure randomness.  Because of all the interacting (but individually simple) special powers, there is a lot of information about your opponent's biases to work with.

A nice little filler, but as much as I love action programming/simultaneous action selection, I fear there might not be enough to go on here and predict the plans of the opponnent. Will try to play a couple of games more and the note will either drop to '5' if it turns out to be as chaotic and light as I suspect it might be, or up over 7 if experience gives consistent wins such as with Shogun or Dungeon Lords.

If you are not looking for deep mind games and quiet, slow thinky, games, it is an absolutely lovely little thing to break out with non-gamers - despite minimalistic and simple contents, it oozes theme and is one of  the more pleasant games to stare at at any price point.

A cool little 2-person game produced in Poland that captures the spirit and feel of '7 Ronan' pretty well (considering the ronin are little discs and the bandit ninjas are little cubes).  Nicely produced with very attractive artwork, and rules in English now supplied as well.  It's a game of area control, with hidden placement of units, followed by 'combat' and other outcomes based on special abilities of the ronin and characteristics of the areas the ninjas succeed in occupying.  Only 8 turns, so not a long or complex game, but some very interesting decisions and constraints involved.  Worth a look (and, IMHO, to buy).

Quick smart hidden movement asymmetric two player zerging ninjas vs. the 7 ronin protecting the village. Ninja cubes become wounds on the ronin cards. Ronins try to outlast the ninja attack and the outnumbering ninjas try to control  a set amount of the village. Try to out smart each other on which area of the village you are moving to gain its special ability (like the inn, well, watch tower, grainery, fields, etc.).

Being a big fan of both The Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven (the original) I was interested in this from the outset, and I think the theme does come through. The game isn't intuitive to learn as you need to constantly check the reference sheet to see what the ronin and village abilities are. But I think this will improve with more plays. It plays quickly and I enjoyed the tactical nature of it. The component quality could've been better.

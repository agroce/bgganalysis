One more of these Dalmuti-like games, which need a big party and are nothing special.

Similar to Gang of Four, The Great Dalmuti, President, Dilbert Corporate Shuffle and somewhat similar to Frank's Zoo. This game accommodates up to 8 players which is a bonus.

Combined with a strong emphasis on tactics at the expense of strategy, The evaluation skills required to play trick taking games escape me, and I'm not interested in pursuing them. I'd rather play [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16632/gops]GOPS[/url] or any of it's reimplementations

Played countless hours in college. Sometimes mixed several decks together for a super-long, somewhat-less random games. Developped several variants along the way. All in all, good fun and scales failry well. Once I was able to jump from last to first place 3 hands ahead of everybody, with no jokers or aces, in a 6-player game. I'm proud of that accomplishment to this day :p

Fun card game. A usual cards can be used for 4 players game. This game is very suitable to play at the beach, because it forces to change the sitting place and you will get nice brown color for all parts of your body ;-)

Awful!  If you don't do well in the first round you're domed to lose forever - and it's not even fun when you're losing!

Surprisingly good trick-taking game. All the switching of roles and exchanging of cards is a bit on the annoying side; On the other hand, it has the nice effect of telling you a bit about who is likely to have the good cards.

RATING: 4
A Great Dalmuti-esque ladder-climbing, "trick-taking" game that works fine but lacks the charm of some of the other published version of this concept.

RATING: 6
Card game with very simple rules. The name is misleading: Much more like UNO than like Poker. Fun, but probably not a lot of replay value. Good filler because players can easily drop in and out. Rating after one game night with a few plays.

I can't even count to the point how often I have played this. This is the game for emotions. It made us laugh every time, then again sometimes it made us cry from despair. But the best part about it was being the dishwasher and then getting very bad cards and taking the boss down with you.

Ok game to waste some time and have someone bring the drinks and deal the cards. It portraits life very good: what's down stays down - game can be really annying if you're at the bottom of the picking order but it's fun when you are the boss!

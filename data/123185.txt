GAME: Axis & Allies 1941
RANK: 3434
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great introductory version of Axis & Allies.  You can use this version to teach new players and kids the basics then slowly move on to the more advanced games.
It is also much faster than the other A&A games; you can play a game in around 2 hours vs. a few hours to a whole evening for the other versions.
The one main negative for this version is the numbers of units you get with the game - 160, which is less than half what you get with the 1942 version.

RATING: 5
[I]tl;dr - Its main achievement is that it's very cheap -- but the full-fat Axis & Allies will still offer you a better experience.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

This promised to be a more streamlined version of Axis and Allies -- and it is -- but I think I still prefer the full-fat experience of the original game. Rules streamlining is a good idea, and this could serve as a basic introduction to the full game, but you'll still want to 'graduate' to the real game eventually. 

For $13 on Amazon at the time of writing, this is an easy and cheap way to see what Axis and Allies is all about. That said, the 'full' game is really not [i]that[/i] complicated (though with a lot of rules exceptions), and I'm willing to stomach a little complication in a 3-4 hour game. 1941 still takes 2-3 hours, and the lighter ruleset worked fine -- but it was nothing exceptional. Personally, if I'm putting in the time anyways, I'd rather play the original.

For another take on the 'family-weight' wargame, check out [thing=204184][/thing], which has absolutely nothing to do with Risk and offers epic battles in that 2-hour playing time. Risk Europe takes some cues from A&A's battle system, which I think is a good thing. Overall, I could see Risk Europe and 'full' Axis and Allies coexisting in my collection, but not 1941 and full Axis and Allies.

RATING: 7
This is basically Axis & Allies light, featuring less spaces, units, and money than the main A&A games. I like it, as the game takes much less time to play to completion. Compared to the main A&A games, this version has cheaper pieces, less figures, and no paper money, so I like to use the money and pieces from a different version when I play this one.

RATING: 6
Better than the 1942-game. 
There could be more miniatures, but solid rules (not too complex, but deep enough for experienced boardgamers) and good map.
If you consider to buy the 1942, I recommend to buy 2 copies of 1941 instead (which cost together just a little more).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a streamlined version of A&A.

Very good at teaching and introducing people to the genre but nothing more.

As other said (and as every modern editions of A&A), components are short and their quality is on lower side.
That was to be expected of a game I paid 20$.

My rating is based on the teaching/introduction aspect more than anything else as it is the reason why I bought this version for in the first place.

1941 is my favorite two-player game. 1941 keeps things as short as possible, but retains the flavor and mechanics of the original. Although the first printing was unbalanced of 1941 was in favor of the Axis, the revised setup conditions are much more equal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The best Axis and Allies version available for beginners. I teach everyone the game with this version if it is available. It is a shorter game, with less territories, and less pieces to understand. Still has very fun replay value with beginning players. I would recommend the other versions once this one becomes generally too simple (although advanced players would have great strategic games with this version on their own).

Need only the thematic box and figures for my A&A´41 Global Conflict MOD (units roll 2D6, convoy, Navy recon, tactical support, realistic air ranges). Combined with the 1st A&A 1942 Box, this will be my most liked MOD of an Axis & Allies Clone. This Fan made map is awesome!

RATING: 7.5
A quicker version of the huge boardgame that has most of the fun features of the original but that definitely shows where the production costs were cut: the components are of lesser quality (cardboard instead of plastic, smaller...), omitted completely (you need pen and paper for this one) or provided in less-than-desirable quantities. However, the miniatures are different for all of the nations.

What is a bit strange is that the same number of all of the units is provided for each and every one of the nations, while Russia is quite unlikely to produce as many naval units as, say Japan, before the game is over.

The rulebook is very well-organised but lacks a summary of the most important rules.

I agree with what several reviewers said: the Russians are not very fun to play as, so a 5-player game is not a very viable option.

Since the starting setup is pre-determined, the replayability of this game (and actually every A&A game) is more limited than that of many other games.

Still, my general verdict is very favourable, also because the rules are quite intuitive and the game can be played in much less time than other versions.

RATING: 8
Bought historic pieces to fix that issue.  Added plastic mini poker chips and some paper money.  This is the tightest, most nerve wracking A&A I have ever played.  The decisions are agonizing.  You have so little and any mistake can cost the game.  I was laughing as my very experienced and very good play partner was struggling to make decisions.  We thought that this was supposed to be an introductory game, but I think it will greatly challenge experienced players.

A bit more luck dependent than traditional Axis and Allies as there are fewer units, which make dice rolls more crucial. It makes up for it though with the time factor, allowing a game to be played in about a quarter of the time of the original.

I like the easier set up and quicker turns vs. the 1942 version.  It has less decisions and has more of a luck factor since there are fewer pieces to even out the dice rolls.

The pieces are hard to distinguish at times, and the set-up for the Axis powers are grossly overpowered (yes, this is realistic, but for a game that will take 3+++ hours, this is not my idea of fun).

Bought from Amazon $15.99; NOV 2016. Haven't played this version specifically but Axis and Allies is a Strategy dice-rolling war game like Risk on steroids. Great fun if that is all you plan to play for a day/evening. Setup alone can take an hour+ with a 3+ hour gameplay minimum and more likely 5+. Interesting alliance between the Allied nations and Axis powers increase the strategy

This game is shorter than all other versions of Axis and Allies that I have played. In a few hours we finished this game. Axis do seem to have a significant advantage at the beginning compared to the other versions. The new recommmended set up adding 2 inf in Russia and 1 destroyer in Eastern US does seem to balance things out.

In terms of production, it is unforgiveable that such a well known series should produce such an appalling failure of not only having rubbish pieces, but not enough such that on the second turn of the game, you are using something else to represent provided game pieces.  So, in this regard, the game is given an overall rating of 3. In terms of just game play, its almost risk with better theme and a money system.  Its reeks of ye old game play, yet the theme still makes it interesting, despite the fact there was no way we would have completed the game in 3 hours. That said, whilst i wouldnt mind having a serious go at this game, it probably will be a few years before i come back to it,  so a game rating of 5 (March 2014). UPDATE: In 2017, there is just better production and game systems to play - gone (Rating 4.428, Jan 17)

1941 is a wonderful distillation of the original game into an accessible, relatively brief package. This version is ideal for teaching the game to new players or scratching the itch when you don't have time for one of the full versions of the game. This is the iteration that got be back into the game after almost 20 years, and is what I used to teach me son how to play. Also, I find that the stripped down economy and numbers of units in this version make for more careful planning and use of your troops. If you're curious to try A&A or looking to get back into the game, 1941 is a fantastic (re)entry point.

Was about to buy this game, but it is so similar to 1942 that I felt it was not worth $30. Better to print out the instruction manual and setup changes and use that as a rule variant for the 1942 game, given that the map is otherwise the same. Granted, IPC values of territories have changed, but dividing all values by 1/2 solves that particular problem. I just don't know... It would be more convenient to use the standalone 1941 game when initiating new or young players into AAA, but then it feels redundant to own it.

For me this game is off the table since I bought AA 1942 2nd edition but it remains a gateway game for me. Without this I wouldn't the boardgamer I am today. 

Don't get me wrong, before playing AA 1941 I was already an avid boardgamer. However, we all played only Eurostyle board games like Catan, Carcassone etc. What AA 1941 did for me was open my eyes to the Ameri- and Eurotrash games like the ones we played when we were young (Heroquest, Space Crusade, ...) but this time for adults.

So here's to AA 1941. I'll probably sell you really soon but I will always remember you as the one that got me crazy again for boardgames.

It's a nice surprise: I found this game in a well know local shop and have been attracted by:
- low playing time
- low price
- memory of nice games with the original Axis&Allies.
Played solo once and 1-1 game. Very nice experience.
This game is unforgiving, since the resources are very limited, so a wrong move of a single unit can be dangerous and unbalance your forces. The dice can also make the difference.
The only Cons. I have is the number of units.
Overall, I enjoy it!

I never thought I would run into a game that I would rate a 1. Especially a game from my high school years that I enjoyed so much. This just breaks my heart to see a game that I loved so much as a young teen completely destroyed and unplayable. 

The poker chips from the old Milton Bradley editions have been replaced with super thin, super micro paper bits. It is hard to call these cardboard because they are so incredibly thin. Then to top it off, there are not enough of these pieces of paper to even set up the game! 

How can a publishing company, in good conscience, publish a game with not enough components to set the game up! So sad! I can live with the "no paper money" part of the game (even though the old game had paper money) as some games do require you keep score or some other number on paper and pen (scrabble comes to mind). 

Some of the ships that come with the game are hard to distinguish between which should not ever be a problem when publishing a game. 

Did they play test this at all or get a focus groups opinion or did they decide the game was good enough on the name and past merits alone? I will not try to play this nor will I find substitute parts to make the game playable. Trading ASAP. Now to locate the out of print edition that I fell in love with when I was young.

Due to the small amount of pieces on the board you need to think very strategically.

Really cool game, have enjoyed a few plays. Only reason for the relatively mediocre rating is simply the complexity.

I was skeptical, looked like a step backwards. I finally payed it with my kids (ages 12 & 14) and it was one of the very best game nights ever! The game goes back to basics and focuses on out of the box playability. And playable it was - after a quick overview of the rules we only had to stop the game one time to go back to the rule book to look something up. The game moves quickly and there are lots of tough strategic decisions to make. The low unit count and low IPC levels really make you weigh options carefully before committing your scarce resources to battle.

More importantly though was the reaction of my kids to the game. We had literally hours of discussion on WWII intertwined in the game. From Stalingrad to North Africa to the battle for the North Atlantic ... oh it was just an awesome experience. They had all these little snippets of history (a by product of growing up with the History Channel) that they knew, but only as isolated events and stories - One game of A&A 1941 drew all that knowledge together into an "a-ha I get it!" moment. Very cool.   

Be sure to use the official set up errata if you have a pre-2014 copy.

Very simplified gameplay, with very limited incomes and therefore very few units in play; consequently it's a fair bit more luck-dependant than the other editions, and with the limited incomes the strategic options are painfully limited.

If you are thinking about Axis and Allies, go for the full game of 1942.  Th2e 1941 is the trainer version and is only useful for the extra parts. DO NOT BUY 1941! DO BUY 1942.

This game is best used to teach someone the fundamentals of Axis and Allies, then forgotten about.  Very unsatisfying with regard to strategy and tactics. Stick with AA1942.

Grew up playing the original and loved it.  This version has some major flaws at setup and they don't even give you enough pieces to really field a normal sized force (especially infantry).  I liked a few changes such as battleships taking two hits, the addition of destroyers, but not enough to make me want to play this version again

I need more plays to see if I prefer this to vanilla A&A. There is a slightly lower rules overhead, and supposedly it's much shorter. My one solo play was 90 minutes in with no clear winner, though the Axis seemed strong.

Played with another player and Axis won handily. Wonder if Russia can ever hang on!

Like most Axis and Allies games this suffers from a lack of pieces. However it does play faster and is very cheap. All in all a great quick playing alternative to the full axis and allies.

I rank this even higher when playing with my 10-year old daughter, so it goes up to 8 for that. For me personally, it is a 6 and I prefer AA42.2. She is mercilessly aggressive which makes her the perfect player for the Axis. She is struggling a bit with the concept of saving money which in AA1941 is infinitely more important than in other iterations of this. That is also the only downside we both discovered, you are simply too poor to really create lots of stuff. Thus, every die roll becomes more important than ever...which can be really swingy. As to play balance: I have still to win against her, so I am not ok with it!

There are some balance issues. To help alleviate this, we give the Soviets an additional three infantry and the US an additional IPC to start in order to balance the game a bit better. Good for a tight, fast game of Axis & Allies. Game is cheap but they skimped on the components.

A richly themed WWII strategy game that did not come with enough components which you quickly run out of. AP prone gamers will grind this to a halt and extend the playtime by hours.

Pros:
* Great theme if you like war games.
* Inexpensive - I mean dirt cheap.
* Nice production value for the cost.

Cons:
* Do not play this with AP prone gamers!
* Map is unnecessarily distorted.
* Not enough pieces come with this edition to play without constant swapping them for other tokens.
* The estimated 2 hour game time is about 4 hours too short. If this is the "streamlined" version I cannot imagine the full game.

This edition is incredibly cheap compared to my old MB game. The map doesn't lie flat on the table, there's no money for counting IPC in it, they left out the factories and printed ugly symbols on the board, there are not really enough miniatures, but the worst is the stacking counters: cheap, cheap cardboard. Fiddly. :yuk:

There appear to be some serious balance issues and lack of playtesting before this game was brought to market.  But the game has been shortened in length including set up time to make it a manageable 2-2.5 hour game, so I would play it again.  Maybe some official house rules could fix the balance issues.

The first play doesn't really count because we didn't finish it. My friends I was 1v2ing surrendered after I took over Russia after 4 hours. I feel like this game plays best with 4. That being said, there is a LOT of strategy, cool components (a little thin and needs more dice though), and a beautiful board. However, if you do not like dice rolling, this game is not for you, and feels luck-based in a lot of scenarios; the luck does eventually balance out due to the nature of luck and the length of the game. 

So yeah, this game takes probably a day to finish (like 9 AM to 9 PM). I played the 1914 version, which seems like it would take at least 3x as long to finish.

I think it is a good game. I believe it favors the Allies slightly, even though the Russians usually fall.  It can end up taking 4-6 hours, though sometimes it takes only 2-3 hours.

The issue of the US starting IPCs (should be 17) will be corrected in the next print run. Also, the setup will be adjusted as follows:

USSR: Add 3 infantry to Russia
USA: Add 1 infantry to Northwestern China and 1 destroyer to sea zone 11

The adjusted rulebook should be available for download once the next print run is released.

Say, if this were just another fictitious board game, I wouldn't be so concerned about historical accuratness... but this is a WWII game and is, unfortunately, not really accurate. Don't get me wrong! The gameplay is great! I'd recommend this for people that are new to axis and allies. It's a good starter. More experienced and demanding axis and allies players, this is not for you!

This version is a real brain buster since 
you can not push your luck, if a offensive 
doesn't work out you could be in a very bad
position. Do not over ride a long term
strategy with impulse, you will loose.

I don't need much more than this for a passable war game experience; there's plenty to think about as you play, but never so much that you can't just start fighting and let the chips fall where they may. But the game, in any version I've played, simply has the ghastliest ergonomics I've ever encountered in a board game: naval pieces are incredibly difficult to differentiate, the board spaces are comically small for the unsightly junkpile of plastic they need to support, and by providing the absolute bare minimum of components, the publisher guarantees a ton of extra fiddlyness. I'd play it again with counters, but not until then.

A streamlined version of the classic A&A game.  Great for beginners and trims down a lot of rules.  Can confuse a veteran due to these rule differences.  Quite fun, though with reduced IPC generation, fewer units see the board and thus battles are much, much more decisive.  This may mean luck matters a bit more than usual, but it keeps battles suspenseful and lowers the game duration.

RATING: 9
Fantastic game!  It really captures the challenges faced by the different powers during the second world war, and creates a feeling of being constantly under threat.  Each power is typically engaged on more than one front, and so is unable to commit solely to a single goal.  You cannot simply carry out your own strategies as you constantly have to react to the actions of the rival powers.  The board can change significantly during a single round.

It plays best with either two or five players, and takes a long time to play.  Five hours is typical when playing with people who know what they're doing, and we have had games where that time has elapsed and no one clearly has the upper hand.  The games vary quite a bit depending on the strategies employed by each player, and it's fascinating to rewrite history by taking different paths than those taken in the actual conflict.  We've had land battles on mainland US, D-Day landings in Norway, British liberations of Hawaii among many others.  One thing always seems to be present though:  It always kicks off in the Caucasus!

For some nations, like Russia who are under serious threat from the start, patience can be a good strategy.  For others, like Japan, aggressive expansion can be really beneficial, especially as this will distract the US and help the Germans.

A great game, and highly recommended.

Could have been a 10, if buying chart would have allowed more unit buy per turn. Its totally broken now. If they though to attract newcomers to A&A franchise, its a big mistakes. A&A is fun partly because of the buying process. Also, there is too few units for each army ( like 2 destroyers per armies max !!!!???!?!??)

PROS : smaller map, faster gameplay, new sculpts are excellent !!!

Great as a primer for teaching the rules of Axis and Allies to a new player.

But it is deeply and fundamentally broken on its own. Totally biased towards Axis, almost no strategic decisions for Allies. Win in three turns every time for Axis if played correctly (blow up British navy, rush to Moscow--not even complicated). Low number of units means that dice rolls do not tend towards the likely outcome, it is way more luck driven in the long run (e.g. Axis and Allies Europe probably has as many rolls for Germany's first turn as the entirety of a game of AAA 1941).

I like the tighter economic situation in this game, it adds a lot of tension.  I found myself missing some of the unit capabilities from other versions, but I understand the point of leaving them out to simplify the rules.

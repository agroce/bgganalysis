Lattice.  A nice idea and engaging abstract.  The necessity of the use of moon and sun stones works, but as a result the game lacks the simplicity of a classic abstract such as Ingenious or Qwirkle.  The rules state each player gets and even number of random tiles.  These tiles include valuable wind tiles which permit the movement of previously laid tiles.  These wind tiles are far too important to be drawn randomly as one player could be severely disadvantaged by a bad tile draw and few or no wind tiles.  The designer of the excellent Uptown had a similar issue with the timing of the drawing of the '$' tiles in that game and came up with a neat variant where each player's '$' tile is put to one side at the beginning of the game and then drawn when required.  I would suggest a similar variant for Lattice, whereby the wind tiles are divided equally between the players at the beginning of the game and kept face up, to be drawn as required.  It is certainly recommended that one or two of these are held until the end game to enable players to lay their final tiles, which otherwise can be problematical.

Further plays now, but with the variant suggested above(separating the wind tiles which are allocated evenly).  Don't use the bags.  Each player's tiles are kept orderly upside down in a rectangle.  The wind tile face up alongside.  You can draw the wind tiles when required instead od an upturned tile.  You can see how many tiles your opponents have and how close they are to finishing.  Much more satisfying.  With the variant I have increased my raring from a 7 to and 7.5.

This is a great little board game suitable for kids but with plenty of strategy and depth for adults too.  More skill than luck, but not by so much that kids cannot enjoy the game.  If you like Rummy-Q then this is in that vein but with much more complexity and multi-turn strategy required to achieve a victory.

Latice is kind of like the love-child of Scrabble and Rummikub, neither of which game I like, but I really enjoy Latice!

It's a light tile laying game where you match on either colour or shape with the adjacent tile.  The first player to play all their tiles is the winner.  There's opportunities for clever tile placements that keep the game interesting and engaging.  The more adjacent tiles you manage to match, the more "stones" you win.  You can then "pay" with the stones to play more tiles.

I strongly recommend dividing the wind tiles up equally between all players.  They are powerful tiles so without sharing them equally, an advantage would be given to the player who picked up the most wind tiles.

I think both gamers and non-gamers would enjoy this because it's easy to teach but has deeper, thinky, clever moves to enjoy.

"What if Qwirkle had a finite board?" That's Latice. At 2 players it seems to come down to the luck of the initial draw and who has more wind tiles in their pile (to draw down faster). Will have to try with 3 or 4 to see if it makes the wind tiles more tactical.

좋은 가족 게임입니다.

규칙도 쉽고, 전개가 빨라서 부담없이 언제나 플레이 할 수 있습니다.

타일 색감도 좋고, 예뻐서 더 매력적인 것 같습니다.

설명서에 한국어도 포함되어 있어서, 더욱 마음에 듭니다. ^^

I count this as a very successful Kickstarter.  Game came in on time and is good quality.  The game play is fun.  Trying to maximize your turns (use as many of your 5 tiles each turn as possible) is challenging.  My family has enjoyed this and suggestions that we play it are well received.

Some of my pieces have very sharp break edges, for a deluxe edition this is not OK. I've reported this but never recieved a reply. I'm disappointed by this poor customer service since they seem to go out of their way to get 5-star reviews.
That said the gameplay is ok, nothing special, but ok for families.

Gorgeously colored board and tiles.  Great game for kids.  It's like a combination of dominos and uno.  The sparkly stones add an upscale touch.  For some reason I always think of Argentina when playing this game....HINT: Check out their flag :)

Be the first person to get rid of all your tiles in this light tile-matching game.  It's the kind of game you can play that won't horribly challenge you, yet gives you enough to keep you interested.  You may even find yourself wanting another play right away.  Turns move fairly fast.  Elements of this remind me of Quirkle, without involving some of the constant score-keeping that goes on in that game.

Backed on Kickstarter - a very fun abstract, Latice takes clues from other simple tile-based games and really makes something unique. My friends and family have really enjoyed it the dozen or so times I've gotten it to the table. I consider it a "Qwirkle-killer".

RATING: 7.1
Similar to Qwirkle. For a more balanced game, each player should begin with the same number of wind tiles.

This may have just replaced Quirkle!  Love this game!  Just wish the tiles were heftier than just chip board.

This game is a fun family strategy game.  We enjoy playing, and while it's for up to four players, we prefer two to three most of the time.

Completto와 비슷한 수준으로 생각했으며, 처음엔 나름 운적인 부분이 많았지만 재밋게 했다. 여러 판을 해보고 나니 바람의 영향이나, 누군가의 편한 플레이가 다음 사람에게 영향을 줘서 너무 편파적으로 흘러갈 수 있고, 자신의 패의 영향이 너무 커서 괜찮긴한데 많이 아쉬움을 줬다. 가끔은 괜찮지만, 연속으로 자주는 좀 식상할 수 있다.

An ok abstract game that is a bit long to be just a filler but not enough of a game to plan a gaming session around. I'd use an even distribution of the 'wind' tiles on setup.

Excellent game.  Has elements of a lot of games, but done in a way that is unique and enhances the game play.  My wife enjoys the game and the simple game play is really enhanced with the players ability to come up with quite complex strategies and moves.  I feel this is very well balanced game.  My wife and I play, and even play with another couple.  Every time we have played we have had a good time, so this is a game we will break out.  Not taking a ton of time to read and setup has been a great plus for us on this game as it isn't a great investment in time, as we have a three year old and our time is limited.

Wonderful tile laying game. Reminds me a little of Qwirkle with a board. But you earn sunstones for creating matches with adjacent tiles. Plus the wind tilea allow you to move already placed tiles.

If you have mastered Ney vs. Wellington (NvW) than you must try this one: It's NvW's big brother and a monster-Waterloo. But it's fun to play and a great tactical challenge!

RATING: 4
Impressive-looking game.  But way too easy to rout a unit, IMHO.  Fixes required.  Unit types need to have specific characteristics.  Everything here is pretty vanilla.

RATING: 2
The one and only monster game I ever owned (and the only one I played, too). Contrary to many other reviewers, I thought the rules system was outstanding, and highly realistic...too realistic, in fact. The game system seemed to always force you into particular choices, it kinda played itself, and was too predictable. This, combined with the huge amount of time and space needed, gives it my rating. (The best thing about the game by far were the cavalry charges!)

A classic, and it still plays well. Designer Davis produced an elegant, asymmetrical sequence of play that mirrors the unique factors that make up the famous battle. The use of skirmishers is questioned by some, but overall the system and game hold up well. One of the first games to use a contour system of terrain.

RATING: 5
I appreciated the fact that this was one of the first Monster games.  But besides the very good (but not outstanding) map, the rest of the graphics and the system itself was oddly colorless.  Too many cookie cutter unit values, zero extra color on the counters, an involved system.  I played the main scenario twice, and the warm up a few times, but the effort to payback ratio was not there for me.

Grand tactical battle. Lovely map, but counters are a little dated now. Interesting cavalry charge mechanic as charge radius is determined from facing and distance to targets. I also like the tiring corps rules whereby activation of same affects overall ability. Rest is not a bad thing for corps moving long distances. Battalions break down into skirmishers which is also unique. 4 maps, so space is needed.

I have a passion for Napoleonics, and I loved this game. Its massive,long, and gives a wonderfully accurate picture of the battle. The "army morale" rules were the first of their kind as far as I recall, and could profitably be used in more modern wargames, many of which pale in comparrison to this classic. Nice board (you'll need a clubhouse to lay it out), and tons of colourful units as befits the period.

RATING: 7
A system I love in spite of its ham-fisted approach to unit morale; the panzer skirmishers; and the clunky cavalry charge rules. (Can't someone do something?) Even so, it efficiently captures the feel of the three arms and how they interact (yes: rock, paper scissors) with a pretty fast and simple system. If you ever play it to the end, which you won't, I think you'll find the French can't lose. And there's nothing like the long view of the map with all those battalions lined up against each other.

RATING: 8
It's big. It's colorful. It feels accurate. It's a monster. Another game that I've played *once*, but I've worn out my copy of Ney vs. Wellington, which has the same system, so I am confident in this rating.

This is a BIG, beautiful game.

The visuals are impressive, different colored armies, nice map, and models historical events very well.

It takes very long to play and occupies more real estate than many can find at home. Skirmishers do run much of the battle, although that is simply a matter of abstraction/modeling taste (how much mustard do you put behind the skirmisher's historical role vs. what the counters are empowered to do).

The French player will have a tough time learning how to win (unless Wellington blunders). I heard a veteran player say that once the French player learns how, the French win consistently; however, I haven't learned such a method.

One army or the other will eventually disintegrate -- whose will it be?

RATING: 5
rules fantastic, map fantastic, gameplay is just impossible one sneeze and Reille's corps are blown from hougomont to plancenoit. the hexes are just too small and with the stacking rules make it a nightmare.  also it takes far too long to play took me an age just to set it up, although it did look great once I'd finally got there.  Ive played my own variant using larger hexes which made the game much more playable but to do this on the scale of Waterloo you`d need a bigger house than mine. I'd reccomend it's little brother Ney Vs Wellington the battle of Quatre bras. Basically the same game but on a much smaller scale, taking a lot less space and a lot less time to play.

RATING: 9
Excellent: Tactical - Waterloo - Medium / Difficult

Plus:
-Even after 3 decades it is still the best simulation to date on the battle of Waterloo
-Great system that focusses on all tactical elements of napoleonic warfare and integrated them very well together
-Assymetrical phases for French & Allied 
-Challenging but absolutely playable game and not too complicated compared to La Bataille and BAR
-Great production value for it's time
-Along with La Bataille de Mont St. Jean, this is the most involved Waterloo simulation
 outthere and one of the most involved games overall I can think of; can you beat Wellington before the Silezian Landwehr arrives to spoil the party?

Minus
-Why use 4 massive maps as in my opinion 2 maps would have been sufficient (most of the sides are not in play and are used for tables, which coul dhave been on separate player aids). Hence I can't setup this baby anytime you want to. 
-Skirmishers were important and an integral part of Napoleonic Warfare but here there might be a bit too much emphasys on the Skirmishers role; this feature is what makes this game unique but it is also it's most debated point.
I am not an expert and the question is, do the skirmishers do justice in terms of weight compared to the overall game? 
-Tables are according to D6 and it would have been great if there were d10 tables available as this would be more realistic. But hey, can't complaint as it is from the eightees.
-Artillery limited to 8 shots per game. Feel too restricted if you ask me.

Even after 30 odd years this is still the best playable serious treatment of the battle of Waterloo!! (LaBat is extraordinary much work). 

So finallly I aquired an unpunched 1983 TSR version and it is as new. A long awaited dream came through and this is gaming at it's best as playing this baby feels as if you were there:

Again, IMO there is no better game available on Tactical Napoleonic Battles. Many games use brigades but imo this isn't  reflecting Napoleonic Warfare.  

My favorite game that unfortunately requires loads of space & time and I wish they had included a smaller map of the central area.

Wellington's Victory is an excellent simulation of the Battle of Waterloo, providing players with a real insight into the battle. The rules are patchy in places, but work well overall. The physical presentation of the game falls short of modern standards but is bearable. However, in my opinion the game is simply too long for what it offers, at least as a 2-player game.

"Terrible Swift Sword" (see), but grander and Napoleonic. While both were great games of similar style, this was my favorite of the two. Last played this in the mid-1990's against my cousin. Had it set up on a huge drafting table in the walk-in attic. (Had the four paper boards mounted on light-weight wood to keep them from buckling.) Took months to complete -- had to be continuously (and very carefully) dusted. Great fun.

Way too big and long.  Beautiful counters and map, but the game always fell apart every time we played it.  The skirmisher rules allow a billion stacks of them to run around, and the battle started to look like the Eastern Front rather than clashes of formed units ala Napoleonic Warfare.  The last time I played it, a stack of 3 skirmishers bounced a cavalry charge made by a English cavalry regiment.  That was it for me.

Very detailed treatment on the battle of Waterloo.  It is certainly more complex than AH's Waterloo but is not boggy at all to play as the "La Bataille" series.  It involves you so deep as if you were really there.  Every move counts and every single moment each side is likely to collapse.  A very good game that worths you to invest a lot of time.  The reward is enormous.  I have the TSR edition.

Good game from the time when they could still make monsters without overburdening them with rules.  The skirmishers need reining in though, and the 1D6-morale system is a bit crude - that the elite units have a 1/6 chance of routing off at the first hit by artillery certainly does not fit the historical conditions.  Still, good history.

What a beautiful game. The production values were supurb and even now would hold up well. The problem for me was that it was just too big and too long if you played the whole thing. I didn't like the skirmished rule but that may have been because I didn't like the extra counters that you needed. I wanted to like it more than I did but I enjoyed what playing time I got out of it.

Very large game of the Battle of Waterloo which I bought at university. I even managed to get a couple of full blown games in. In my last game as the French I took all three strongholds by 1 o'clock, but the VI Corps was routed by a Nassau battalion to break my army, a different die roll would have routed Wellington as both armies were on the verge of collapse. To big though and I sold it.

This game is the true next step in wargames following Terrible Swift Sword. Davis developed the multi-level LOS rules that later games took for granted. Wellington's Victory (first edition) is a map that could hang as art in most wargamer's walls. Levels, hilltops, crestlines - all this and charts and tracks, too. The counters with their primary colors and big troop symbols were excellent. The rules are more detialed than TSS, which is why this system did not take off. They are also a little difficult to grasp the turn sequence. BUT worth the effort. This is truely a case of mineatures come to the mapboard, without the expense! Also, see Ney vs. Wellington to get the tuneup you need to play this 4 map monster!

As a grade school student, I pre-ordered this gem.

WV is among the most underappreciated war game of all time.  Frank Davis's design was incredibly coherent.  Each type of unit had its historical role to fulfill (and the cavalry charge mechanic made the adrenaline rush!).  Each unit had its own morale rating, and then there were the army morale and brigade commitment rules.  All fairly elegantly done I might add.

And who can forget what the historical scenario looked like when setup!  Nothing takes you back to 11:30 on a certain June Sunday than that!

Game had its flaws:  Skirmisher units that acted like body shields for columns of infantry, the most bizarre LOS rules imaginable, and an ultra-bloody CRT even for Waterloo.

It is good that Decision Games is considering a remake of this classic.

RATING: 9
What 'Terrible Swift Sword' is to Gettysburg, this game is to Waterloo. Miniature gamers (like me) will be right at home with the system - Waterloo at the Battalion/Company level - infantry, artillery, cavalry, fire, melee, charges, and morale. The TSR version cleans up and polishes the game from the original release: the rules are cleaner, the counters are glossy, the maps are nicer. But the game is still the grand tactical struggle that grognards know and love. The game doesn't force the French into the tactical missteps that were made historically, and the French commander won't have to leave the field for from stomach pains, so you can count on the French doing better - maybe; just because you know what mistakes were made doesn't mean you won't make new ones...

Like the LB system it fails to truly show Napoleonic warfare. But at least WV has the excuse of not being refined where as LB has been through several updates and still has not got the job done. At this point the best idea would be to look for a miniatures rules set.

This game deserved a better fate than the bastardization that was done to it in the second release of the game. Nothing from the original design including scale made it into the re-release except taking the name in the hopes of fooling the uninformed!

I played my old SPI edition several times to completion during the 1970's.  Would gladly play again if the conditions were right.

Downright ugly map. Skirmish rules made the board cluttered with midgets. Clash of Arms did this so much more in style.

Kickstarted a signed copy. #101 with a signature "To Kenya!" For my oldest daughter.

Strangest kickstarter campaign ever: Seems almost purposely vague about the game rules & not very forthcoming with specific details or answering backer questions. However, the few updates were nice, if not a little lackadaisical and unhurried. 

It funded the first day without a game play description! Just shows the strength of their fan base (including me).

Update:
The wood board is at the bottom of the box, under the form fitted insert. The insert is difficult to remove and removing it risks breaking the brittle plastic. The board does not fit on top of the insert when you put it back in the box; Disapointing.

Still love the look of this game, but with experienced players, it starts to feel like tic-tac-toe.

This game grew on me considerably. This is my go to "chess". Fast. Light. Fun. Loved it enough to acquire #6/20 of the Deluxe Edition.

By jove, this actually works as a very decent abstract! To start: beautiful components.  Wood board and iconic mouse pieces. This game was designed as a sort of "prop piece" to bring a game shown in the Mouse Guard comics to life. But it actually plays differently than any other abstract I've played! It really doesn't feel derivative of anything at all. Can be a bit slow to develop, but the combination of card play and interesting move options all comes together nicely. I was not expecting this game to play as well as it did! Bravo to Luke Crane and his first abstract board game design!

I'm sure there's some strategic depth to what is essentially a simple 2-player abstract game. Cute little mouse tokens don't quite make up for a disappointing, dry experience.

I've read the rules a couple times and they just leave me cold. I'd rather get my many other beloved abstracts to the table than give this a shot, but I like Luke and I'm not quite ready to part with the game, so off to storage it goes.

I really enjoy playing this game! It is very fun and entertaining, strategic in a way that is similar to chess, but with elements of luck as well, because of the card deck. This means that you can't always plan ahead. The game is beautifully done in a classic look, with a beautiful wooden board and cute little mice (the cute mice is what got me to buy the game in the first place, since i wasnt yet familiar with the Mouse Guard series). The rule book is clear and easy to understand, and the illustrations are beautiful. I really got interested in reading the Mouse Guard series after playing this game.
Me and my fiancee are always looking for fun games to play together, and this is definately one of our new favourites!

Shockingly good game, especially considering it's origins. Luke Crane and the play testers did an excellent job with development.

A simple abstract game. I thought I would like it, but it doesn't really hit the spot for me. The cards seem almost an after thought, maybe the hand size should be bigger or perhaps you are forced to play one a turn, I don't know. Just missing something for me.

I love the theme and found it a fun abstract, love the cards and how they make you have to think but keep the options small!

Fun, quick, and easy to learn.  The random elements become less so as cards are reviled.  I am excited to try new strategies and figure optimum ways of playing.  People seem to want to learn how to play the moment they see this very handsome game.  The creators have did a marvolus job.  Try this one out if you get a chance.

Simple game with appealing theme but a bit too abstract for my taste.

RATING: 4
Cute little abstract with surprising depth in all its simplicity, but not something I would have played, no less bought, other than as an accessory for the RPG. As a RPG prop, though, it's totally fantastic and well worth playing.

This is a great game if you are looking for something easy to play but yet challenging and fun. Aesthetically beautiful and somehow classic, it contains a solid wooden board and cute plastic mice (white and black). The game itself is easy to get, chess-like, and the use of cards adds the "random" effect on it that makes it really interesting. It is a fast game, so it can be played even if you don't a lot of time available. Me and my fianc√®e loved this game.

Beautiful and minimalist, as an abstract should be! It's a good game, I need to play it more to discover deeper strategies and gameplay.

I really like this game. The idea is ingenious. However, though I don't think it's nearly as broken as others might claim--I've never experienced any of this so-called "Halifax Hammer" business first hand--it does seem like it might not be so perfectly balanced. Mainly, if the British player decides to ramp up his or her military and go for the throat, the French player is forced into the role of simply matching the Brits and keeping the opposing player from winning; instead of playing to win, the French player is playing to avoid losing.

Played this with my wife. Slow gameplay while we learned the game. Aprox. one hour into our first game all the various actions started to fall in place, things moved along much faster and the game went from dull to exciting. My impressions this far is that it is an excellent game for couples, as long as both have the patience to stick with it through the learning curve.

EDIT: After more plays, my wife now refuses to play this any more. When I go for an aggressive strategy, she gets frustrated and feels there isn't anything she can do to counter it. I guess this just isn't her kind of game. I still like it a lot, though.

Dominion like game with a proper theme, asymmetrical sides, conflict. Very clever.

RATING: 9
Starting to get to grips with this one now. Lots of choices and a different feel to playing the British and the French. Can be the height of frustration when you just can't seem to get the right combination of cards however. Great the way the French have so many ways to constrain the British access to money and arms. Will need to play this a lot more to really begin to understand good play. Recommended.

Just notched this up to a 9. My frustration is that I'm not naturally strong at this type of game; my excitement is that there is so much to think about, and the need to balance pursuing an overall strategy with tactically responding to your oponent's moves is ever present. Either way, I find this a tough game to play, whether as the British or the French. I've played it five or six times now and am still discovering new things to consider. A really solid game.

RATING: 8
The cover sold me on this. I love the artwork in this game and the feeling of the era that is so well-communicated just through the art design choices. The asymmetry of the British and the French and the variety of win conditions bring a depth to the proceedings that is palpable. A reimagined use of Dominion's deck-building mechanic brings the war genre a built-in system of fatigue and supply.

The design allows for quick and decisive victories or a long, drawn out tug-of-war, depending on smart card play and timely use of natives. The rulebook is slightly obtuse regarding some of the battle/raid mechanics, but once understood, the battles are simple to understand and the raid/ambush abilities become second-nature. 

Kudos to Martin Wallace for developing such a streamlined and simple deck-building game with historical weight and feel, that also is easy to digest and simple to play. Once again, this is a deceptively deep game, one that boils down to the players' decisions and not the luck of the draw. Now I just need to try out Wilderness War to see which I like better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Definitely one of the best 2-player games once you get a hang of it. I can't say anything about the rulebook since the game was taught to me. However, I hear that it is quite poor which is what you'd expect from Mr. Wallace.

Rating based on 15 plays of the 2nd edition so far.
Components [8/10] - Decent box, good artwork on the board and cards, nice mounted board.  Wood blocks and discs are adequate.  Player aids are nice and very useful.  No victory point track was included but a very nice one is downloadable from BGG.  Some small additions - villages and towns from Settlers, miniature red/blue flags for siege markers, and fortress markers from Customeeple really add to the feel of the game and would have been a nice standard upgrade rather than just having some of these things available in the limited edition.
Cost [10/10] - Reasonable for what you get.
History/Theme [18/20] - Nice historical notes are included in the rulebook and the asymmetry of the way the two sides play add nicely to the theme of the game.  A little historical flavor text added to the bottom of the cards would have been a nice feature.
Strategy [10/10] - Good strategy component to this game.  Really makes you consider tradeoffs in what to play.
Fun Factor [10/10] - Excellent, fun, tense game.  Seems well balanced.
Replayability [10/10] - Many different options to try and the card variability keeps games from being identical.  Yes, there supposedly ways to "beat" the game but we haven't stumbled across them yet and don't intend to turn it into a math exercise.
Length [10/10] - Likely 1-1.25 hours which seems very good.
Intangibles [19/20] - Very fun and satisfying game.  One of those games you walk away from thinking what you want to do different next time.  Rules are excellent - very few questions with most FAQs from the 1st edition seemingly incorporated in the 2nd edition rules.  Not a perfect 20 because sometimes the game ending (based on captured villages/towns or all towns being on the board) seems a little anticlimatic.

Overall: [95/100] = 95.0%

A really great game.  It's got a steep learning curve.  (I can see playing two practice games to even understand all of the moving pieces.)  Well-designed deck-building game.  Lots of interesting decisions to be made, but you can also paint yourself into a corner for several turns.

I took off 1 point for it being so complicated that I'll probably never own it.  (I only own things I can teach.)

RATING: 7
+ Extremely clever combination of a war game and deck builder; Theme and art are wonderfully combined to create a memorable game.
- My wife and I didn't like the direct confrontation here and since it's only two-player, there wasn't a lot of other options for it to hit the table.


Why it's previously-owned:
A two player game usually means playing with my wife, and while she seemed to enjoy this game well enough, I prefer our times together to be a little less directly-confrontational.
I traded this (along with two garage sale pick ups) for Cuba and Cube: El Presidente.  The only other war game that I have (and it's not even a war game, I know that) is Eclipse.

RATING: 5
Over four plays (with a friend for whom it is their favourite game) I just could not work out how to do anything more than just what my cards let me do. I struggled to implement any strategy and found myself railroaded everytime. I so wanted to love this game, as I love everything it's trying to do (i.e. show the difficult logistics of running wars etc through deck building) but I just never enjoyed it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great game with the dominion mechanic that has theme. You do feel like the designer intended that you have a far stretched supply line and an aggressive neighbor on your borders.
Downside compared to dominion is maybe less variety than the many decks in dominion. But that aside, the fact that I have a full game without having to buy expansions is very friendly to my wallet and it is still a very satisfying and fun experience.

There is a lot of discussion here about this game. Obviously, the mechanisms could be further playtested, but my problem was more with production and graphical design. Some changes in the cards would make it a much more accesible game. It is also easy that the game derails in an endless (and boring) match if both players do not get right what the real objective of the game is (and the faster way to reach it).

By carefully not reading the details of those monster threads on the Halifax Hammer, I'm still having fun with this one.  I am a little disturbed, however carefully I don't read those threads, that there isn't unanimous agreement that Wallace has done what it takes to sort out the balance issues. I'd love to see deck building head more in this direction; this one manages to scratch a bunch of itches (wargame, cardgame, euro, ...) at once.

I played it against my best friend and we LOVED it. Instantly bought it and got it hand signed (hunting Wallace was one of the funniest and hardest things we did during "Modena Play" :P ). We'll definitely play it again in the future! I heard something about a bug in the game but it's not something you'd find even after 100 plays and we didn't notice at all.

Higly recommended!

Amazing game in so many ways, even though it is pretty broken and Britain can pretty much force a win.  (This is still the case with the new updated rules that were supposed to fix this).  Still, there is a lot of room to have a great time with this game before you figure out how to break it. :)

RATING: 6.5
Not a wargame per se. More of a theme used by an interesting machanic that runs it well. 

Smooth, simple and rather fast pace. Like any wargame, once there is familiarity, the game actually slows down mainly due to AP. 

The first 2 player antagonistic-euro-machanic-card-driven-worker-placement-like game that I have ever played. For that matter, the theme could have been Arkham Horror flavored.

Die Kombination von Deckbau, Locations und militärischen Karten harmoniert hier sehr gut. Vor allem die, von Wallace beabsichtigte, Darstellung der unsicheren Kommunikationswege zu dieser Zeit in Form der Kartenstapel wirkt stimmig und im Thema. Der Deckbau-Mechanismus wirkt nicht so pur und abstarkt, wie bei Dominion.

Zudem spielt es sich zeitlich sehr angenehm und ist ein sehr schönes 2-Spieler-Spiel.
Als Bonus: Es ist assymetrisch, was ich sehr schätze.

Absolutely outstanding! So unique and original that is difficult to describe it if you didn't play it. It is a strategy game, a deck building game, a wargame, an economy game.... it is a perfect mixture of different ingredients. It is important to familiarize with each side cards, since French and British play with very different strategies. All in all, a must to have! This game is the final proof (but there was no need) that M.Wallace is truly the most visionary and original game designer that's around right now. When a game is easy to understand but difficult to play in terms of mental effort it means that you are dealing with a masterpiece. And A Few Acres of Snow is undoubtedly one.

This is a solid game. I am not remotely a fan of Dominion, but this makes the drafting gameplay interesting. You have different decks (sort of) to draft from, and both sides play differently (I've only played the French) and there are actual strategic, interactive implications to where you go and what cards you introduce to the deck. It's tense. I'm still figuring out the balance, and wonder if it's as well balanced as Twilight Struggle (which it feels somewhat similar to), but it's faster, shorter, and a lot of fun.

A great war-game, fast-playing, does something wonderful with the Dominion mechanic, lots of strategies to explore.

... 

Jan 2012: Martin Wallace has released some slight changes to the rules, and after one play I like them-- seem very balanced and change the game in a good way, that makes it seem new and exciting to play again.

I have never seen the "Halifax Hammer" played, and my one attempt to play it failed. But I do wonder if nevertheless reading so much about it has put me off the game a little.

RATING: 7
This is a nice two player card driven war game that is not particularly accessible on first play, which leads me to a mixed feeling of either wanting to play it again so I can better understand all the moving parts, or, never wanting to play it again, because it was a annoying gaming experience. 

I like the principal attack mechanic in the game, the siege mechanic.  I like the cubes and disks, and  upgrading from cubes to disks to double your VP's.  I like the fortification mechanic. I like the reserve deck mechanic, and the asymmetric decks are interesting.  The deck building and randomized card draws and capabilities each turn, work reasonably well.

I am not that crazy about the ambush and raid mechanics.  They feel like exercises in "guess what card is in your opponent's hand," which is not my favorite way to spend time in a game.  

And while the map appeared very attractive on its surface, the connectivity lines on the map were unexpectedly confusing for me on first play.  I spent too much time trying to "see" the difference between a road, a waterway, and an indian trail.

Overall, I can see why this game has a lot of fans on BGG where Twilight Struggle, Memoir 44, and Command & Colors, all card driven war games, dazzle a core audience of this genre, but for me, this game is merely moderately interesting.  I like it a bit, but I do not love it.

It's got some things going for it, and it's definitely interesting, but it just seems like each side is too pigeonholed into certain strategies, even if you include various community fixes to the balance.  And the inclusion of completely worthless location cards is annoying...  for example, the completely blank British Kennebec card means there's no reason to go there, even though trying to invade Quebec through Kennebec might have been an interesting strategic option.

Will definitely play some more, but even ignoring the broken strategy as published, I'm not sure I understand the high ratings for the game (#61 as of now).

My favorite M.Wallace game, but that's not saying much.... I suspect that to play this well you'll need an overall strategic plan, as well as seat-of-the-pants tactics to deal with a) the order in which your cards appear, and b) what your opponent is doing. Elegant, uncomplicated rules, despite the many actions available. Theme does not feel pasted-on. Tension comes from sieges, ambushes and raids. However, there seems to be a "correct" way to play for each side, and others' comments bear similarities to chess openings (ZZZZZZzzzzzzz.....). Game also seems to take 3 hours to play -- way too long. After a few games, it still seems too hard to get rid of the unwanted cards in your deck, and the thrill simply vaporized. I sold the game.

RATING: 9
This is one of the hardest games for me to rate, but I'm sticking with my 9 for now! It started as a 10, and my favourite buy from Essen 2014.

It could be downgraded to a much lower rating due to it being broken, but I'm honestly not that bothered by it. Having played GW games for 1½ decade, I'm used to house rules and gentleman agreements :)

None the less it still drags too long, due to the 'lose slowly' syndrome. And the games graphic design and user interface are amongst the worst I can remember seeing. It is as if the game is trying to be hard to read on purpose...

However, the thematic-mechanic integration is brilliant. There are so many small moments, where the deck building just shines in this context. And for that it deserves a solid 9!

- Although the map is beautiful, it's not always readable. The fact that you have to look at the cards to see which cities are connected to is pretty idiotic.

I still haven't been able to fathom all the fuzz about how this game is broken ... and I hope I'll never be! I just can see a superbly designed game that feels accurate with the little I know about the conflict and also engaging. I love the deckbuilding aspect of the game but also how it interacts with the board, the asymmetric nuances of each side (in terms of both decks but also in terms of how the board works differently for each side). Beautiful game. Brilliant theme implementation. Outstanding mechanics adaptation. I love this work of art.

Wow!  I really like this game!  I hope my wife and I can actually finish a game soon!

Now we've finished a game. This is crazy fun. The deck building aspect lends a very thematic supply chain consideration to the game.

I have only played as the French, but their deck seems to present a significant challenge especially if the person playing them does not have much experience with deck building games. The Traders and Intendant are vital to French success in my experience.

This is the game that establishes Deck-Building for what it is really good for.  Namely, as a mechanic in a smartly designed game.  Thematically rich, an asymmetric design, and nicely produced makes this one of Wallace's best.  Multiple strategies can be attempted with both the French and British.  This is a very good game worth playing many times.

In short, deck management, and it comes down to how much you like that. Played two games as the french, and it seemed interesting but also fragile in the sense that it can easily clog up. Only more plays will tell whether it's just the way the game is or simply the way I played it.

One of the few games that I just had to quit playing. My wife and I played one and a half games. Usually she's the first to give up on a game, but in this case, I stopped halfway through the second game and said I couldn't do it anymore.

This game isn't my cup to tea, not only do I prefer non-confrontational games but also I don't often play 2 player games - prefer to play in groups (I personally don't own any strict two player games), but a friend brought it over and we played. 

It was ok, but I feel it dragged quite a bit and there was too often I found myself without anything I wanted to do...I had little to nothing to play directly, so I wanted more cards, but there was nothing I wanted to discard or place in reserve. 

Part of my mediocre first experience with this game was poor strategy on my part. I fully admit that, but it was the strat I felt comfortable playing/wanted to play and if that strat has little to no chance to win, well...why would I bother playing more?

Starting as a fun game, the will to win was rapidly growing and also the consciousness that just buying some cards, devoloping some cities is not enough. An easy win is nearly impossible. Constantly watching the actions of the Opponent, optimizing the own deck, looking for connections to the opponents cities etc. is quite fascinating and works quite well.

RATING: 1
Mechanically the game is innovative and adds a new twist to the deck-building genre. But it is also flawed... the halifax hammer exploit is easier to learn than the game, turns the game into a boring war of attrition, and almost guarantees a victory to one side. And while there has been numerous efforts to fix/patch the game, most do little to alleviate the dominant strategy without adding silly randomness.

RATING: 7
Ez egy nagyon ötletes játék, a hangsúly nem annyira a wargame-en van, mert nem egy keményvonalas háborús, hanem tipikus wallace játék. Szerintem veri a másik közelmúltban készült Wallace kártyásat, a Londont...
Ha egy dolgot kellene kiemelni, akkor az a hatalmas szabadság, amit a 21 féle akció kínál. Nagyon kifinomult a pakliépítés megoldása, döntően ennek kreatív használatán alapul a sikerünk vagy a kudarcunk. Igaz, hogy sokszor lutri, hogy milyen kártya van a másiknál, mégis szerintem kijön hosszú távon, hogy ki képzett jobb paklit.
Kifejezetten élveztem a sok féle lehetőséget, az egyébként meglehetősen hosszú játék javarészt elég pörgős volt, csak néha éreztem magam tanácstalannak, mert úgy "beállt" a játék. De ha valaki mer kockáztatni, akkor végig tudja pörgősen játszani. A legjobban a települések összeköttetéseinek kártyákon való leképezése tetszik. 

Az egyik hiba: kategóriájához képest elég hosszú tud lenni, bő 3 óra(de az egyik végfeltétel akár ennek töredéke alatt is bekövetkezhet). A másik hiba, hogy az angol fél erősebbnek tűnik. 

A játék egyébként nyelvfüggetlen, és viszonylag egyszerűen elsajátítható.
---
Kifelejtettem, hogy az ostrom nagyon jól ki van találva, az az egyik legérdekesebb a játékban. A másik amit ki kell még emelnem, az a kártyák tartalékba tétele (hogy ha kell, kéznél legyen), ez hatalmas ötlet, nagyon jó taktikai lehetőségeket kínál!
---
Kipróbáltam a javított kiadást is: a szerző a rajtaütés megkönnyítésével próbálja kiegyenlíteni a francia hátrányt (állítólag az első kiadáshoz találtak az angoloknak nyerő stratégiát). Nos szerintem túl jól sikerült a kiegyenlítés, a franciák rajtaütései túl erősnek tűnnek... Másodjára viszont nem tűnt annyira hosszúnak, egész pörgős volt...
---
Helyesbítés: hibának róttam fel korábban a játék hosszát, de mint kiderült, hibásan játszottuk, nálunk elfogyott MINDEN jelölője egyik félnek, nem csak a város VAGY a falu, hanem mindkettő:)

Húúúú, van benne "erő"! - már korábban ismert játék mechanizmusok nagyszerű keveréke...
Gazdaság, harc, cselszövés, taktika na, meg egy kis szerencse - minden jelen van.

Kevés olyan játékot ismerek ahol a játékos a fordulójában 21 akció közül választhat... - ez talán máris riasztólag hathat. 
2 személyes - na, ezt sem preferálják sokan.
A játék időben nagyon el is húzódhat - na, ez már igazán rémisztőnek tűnhet.
Igazi "gamer" játék - kezdőkkel ne nagyon próbálkozzunk vele.

A kevés játékok egyike amely jobban, élvezetesebben (és precízebben) játszható elektronikus felületen, mint tábla mellett. Így tehát megvétele csak elvakult Wallace rajongóknak ajánlott.

BGG-s helyezése alapján erősen túlértékelt játéknak tartom.

RATING: 9
Temptative rating with only one played game.  But I enjoyed it soooo much, even though it was difficult for me to remember the details.  Not difficult, really, but with several options you have to handle properly.
Really nice art (the cover is just EXCELLENT), and I really like the components of the Deluxe edition.  It's true, pieces are small, but I think they can be used with no problem
The game itself is really interesting, using a kind of Dominion mechanism.  I have not played Dominion more than a couple of times, and I hated it.  But this one, as with London also from Wallace, I find extremely nice.
The game will propably get significantly easier as you play and get a knowledge of the geography (and of course, teh actions).
All in all, and having no idea of what the Halifax Hammer is (and really don't care about it), a magnificent game.

On the other hand I wonder about its replayability and whether or not games will be samey with next plays.

Excellent! Uncle Martin did it again. The deck building element provides countless strategic possibilities which are also intuitive and in accordance with the theme. This is one of the best wargames I've played, along with Hannibal and Washington's war.
The board lacks some needed visual aids (e.g. about what each location would yield) and it also confuses a bit about if some areas are connected or not, but it looks beautiful and it works fine. 
A great deal of strategies to try and explore. What an original use of the deck building mechanic in a wargame. This is the first and only of its kind!

Congratulations Mr. Wallace. you did it again.

edit: second play. my opinion has shifted dramatically to: excellent! (again :D ) each choice in this game is skillfully and subtly intertwined with every other thing. There won't be another one like it. It's not a trend.

RATING: 7.5
Wow, what a wonderful, enjoyable, well-designed game!
It is both an economic and military game, and it's the first game that is built around the deck-building mechanic but where this mechanic is only a mean and not an end!
The game seems to have multiple paths to victory for both sides, with different possible ways to customize the deck and pursuit different strategies. It's everything but a multiplayer solitaire: there's enough interaction to force the players to pay attention and react to the opponent's moves.
There is a whole plethora of actions available, but after the first half game, everything clicks and becomes quite clear (in mechanical terms, not strategy...) and flows quickly and smoothly.
Does this sound as the game is a well mixed cocktail of mechanic? No, it also exhudes theme, both due to the components and graphics, and the gameplay.
I don't know if my initial rating (9) can hold many repeated plays, but I can't remember the last time I was so excited by a game and was not disappointed after the first play.
Hopefully Martin Wallace will use this system as a template for other games. I will buy every one of them!

Edit october 10th, 2011: after several plays, the game showed some harsh problems of balancing, with one particular strategy leading to high percentage British victory outcomes. This needs some kind of fix, because the game is great and it's a shame. Rating downgraded to 7.5 until mr. Wallace speaks about the possible fix.

Edit december 30th, 2011: official rules changes just posted on BGG by Martin Wallace. These should fix the infamous Halifax Hammer problem. Rating raised again to a 9.

Edit january 15, 2012: it seems the fix couldn't actually prevent Halifax Hammer strategies. Sadly downgraded again to 7.5...

First Impressions: I enjoy the deckbuilding mechanism and this game employs the innovative mechanism in an innovative way. The game lightly ties the historical conflict to the gameplay. I wouldn't consider this a wargame as this game can be ported to many other conflicts. Rather, it's a very enjoyable war-themed euro. The game plays fairly quickly and always leaves me with a "just one more game" feeling.

10 Plays: I've recently reintroduced this game to the table after a lengthy hiatus. The more I play it, the more subtle elegance I'm uncovering. I've found this game to work much better with euro gamers as a gateway to wargaming than with wargamers as a gateway to euros. Either way, I'm still enjoying the game and I expect that I will for some time to come.

Could've easily gone higher than a "9" with this game except for how it begins to bog down as your draw deck gets bloated. Yeah, one can keep their deck thin, but that's the concept behind a certain winning strategy for the British that some have said "breaks" the game. This game is too good (when this strategy isn't skillfully employed). So don't employ it (play as the French, if that helps) and enjoy the game.

First Play: I read Martin Wallace's foot notes at the back of the rules with interest when he said he based the card drafting on Dominion. This wasn't a good start I really got nothing out of Dominion, but this looked different. 

The rules took some sorting and explaining but the game started well amd we expanded gradually. And at this point the game hit the skids. I don't think we were bold enough. There were very few sieges, some raids and ambushes but mainly we just expanded until the towns ran out.

Overall I have to say I felt frustrated that the cards in hand just didn't allow me to do what I wanted to. At times they didn't let me do anything at all. I appreciate that you need to develop and prune an efficient draw deck and use the reserves cleverly. This was a huge learning curve game and I need to play again to test out some more theories because this first game dragged on too long and needed incisive action that neither of us executed.

Next F2F is a different affair. Yes there is still frustration at not being able to do what is wanted but its more manageable. Turns are quicker and the ability to prune the dead wood cards churns the more useful cards quicker.

Rating increased and still more room to uplift further with more plays.

The first time I played this I was underwhelmed, I felt limited in what I could do because of a glut of cards in my deck.  Having never played a game where drafting cards was the central mechanic part of my problem was I expected to have access to every card at all times.  When I returned to this game I found that the inability to hold every card and the patience to draft cards now that can be used later is part of the fun.  I have come to really love this game.  The mechanic is not only fun but fits into the theme which I think adds to the experience.

It has the deckbuilding in it yes, but you barely notice it. The game is slow and it has some minor bugs in it as well.

Very original game which introduces deckbuilding in a card driven wargame. While it takes some time to wrap your head around the gamesystem, it plays pretty smoothly once it clicks. And most importantly it is fun. I like assymetrical games very much. However these games tend to have (perceived) balance issues. This one is no different. However fixes are in the make to restore balance in these few acres of snow. So I've good hope this game can be enjoyed for years to come.

An excellent game design for two players. I've played 4 games and it took that long to realize how to play. All my previous plays took a longtime, but now realizing how to play, the game should play in half the time. This is a war game and anyone who says otherwise hasn't figured the game out. I love that Martin specifically designed the game engine to frustrate the players. This is deliberate and it represents the logistical strain placed on England and France. Players will feel the strain more and more as they expand and fight each other. Brilliant! "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

I'm not a big fan of deck-building games, but this game takes the deck-building mechanic and gives it a clear purpose in this French & Indian War-era game. 

Imagine traditional CDG's (with their operations points and events) coupled with deck-building. I think you'd then have a great marriage of deck-building strategy and card-driven tactics.

Production is top-notch and Wallace delivers once again on an elegant game that meshes well with its theme.

Very interesting game -- not a wargame, not strictly a euro, not just deck management.  I dunno what's up with the game, other than it's damn fun!

(Too bad, though, that the term "Native American" was used rather than the correct term, "American Indian..."

After two plays with the british, I'm loving this game... I find that there is a lot going on, still looking for good strategies and hand management eficiency,... More over, it's hard to find such a good eurogame for 2 players only.

If it wasn't for the shameful Limited Edition's micro-components that cost me an arm and a leg this could sit near a 10.

Played this a bunch of times in a row and read a lot here on the geek about strategy. Still learning. The asymmetry is fascinating and I love the historical setting (not to mention the cool artwork and map) but I don't know about game play quite yet. I'm not good enough yet to use the Halifax Hammer so the French player seems to always win. It should be noted also that this is the only deck building game I've come to like to any real extent, too.

RATING: 8.4
Picked up a copy of the pre-order limited edition with the wooden pieces and money.

Looks a simple game with a few cards to collect to build a deck, but there's far more to it than you would think. Casually picking up some cards "to see what they do" does not work. You are forced to plan do to the lag of getting new cards back in to your hand and you need to react to moves made by your opponent to ensure you are not completely left behind in any parcicular aspect. 

Overall, there's quite a lot of actions you can take and the wrong early choices certainly scupper your game. There's military strategies (both sieges and guerilla warfare) and expansion strategies (both settling and upgrading settlements) which help mix things up. Add income generation and hand management aspects and you have a game with a lot of replayability.

I got quite a few plays out of this one before we discovered, we tried to avoid it as long as you can but due to the British's obvious advantage in naval warfare it's hard not to find, the Halifax Hammer.

A no-brainer of a purchase for me, even as a two-player game that I know I won't get to play as much as I'll want (must check out the on-line version). Martin is my favorite game designer and I tend to camp on anything with his name on it. I do sometimes wish he had more development help though. But what enormous creativity!

Deck building, hand management, map board action, a cool theme (sorry), are just a few of the elements that excited me about this release. Pity, again, about the rules though, but I'm pretty used to this by now. It'll get straightened out and may only matter to folks who are planning on taking this to WBC - I'm really not all that competitive as long as I'm enjoying myself.

Rating is based on research and a desk-check. I'm looking forward to playing...
++++++
Finally got to play! Played two games, once on each side. Mostly Civ style so far - expanding, developing and fortifying. Second game saw more raiding and a couple of key sieges - Quebec(!) which failed, and Louisbourg which succeeded. The first game was very close with the French out-pointing the British by a couple (end game triggered by cube depletion) - in the second game the British did better by raiding more effectively than the French and by conquering Louisbourg (end game was triggered by the British managing 12 points via raids). So far, we're not seeing the dreaded imbalance, but neither of us tried the more aggressive approach let alone anything resembling a hammer. Ego not helped by losing on both sides...
++++++
Second session - this time I won both games, once on each side. In the first game I outpointed the British through development and by thwarting his attempts to raid by strategic fortressing and having the blockers at the right time. He did take Halifax and tried for Louisbourg but I was able to hold him off by aggressively ambushing his reserve so he was never able to build up the necessary mass of military for a sustained siege. The Hammer isn't as easy as it sounds - at least at our stage (but we've accepted that it is the British side's best option). During the second game I tried hard as the Brit to build up a sizable military reserve to throw at Louisbourg and Quebec. It took two attempts to finally take a fortified Louisbourg and another two to succeed at Quebec but I got it done! He was racing to exhaust his disks and raid my cubes and if I had not managed the sieges he would have won on points handily. Still I consider my win to be as much luck as good management - I was at the end of my rope militarily and if he had drawn anything on what turned out to be his final turn, I would have been sunk. At our stage at this game we are still enjoying it and not yet seeing a bad balance problem (we are using the Wallace approved rules edit). 

We may get to the stage where balance issues take some steam out of what so far we are completely enjoying, but we will cross that bridge when we get to it. Still, one of the most interesting war-game developments in some years.

ED NOTE: I'm getting a bit tired of the ranting on the Geek about the "broken" nature of this game. Some war games are tilted in favour of one of the two sides if they wish to remain thematic to the period being represented. The other entry from this period, GMT's Wilderness War, is somewhat more balanced but still favours the British. This one may be more tilted toward the British than intended but unless you are tournament level obsessive, there is no reason why you can't still enjoy this truly innovative design concept Martin has developed.
++++++
The game is not finding its way to the table much anymore mostly as my opportunities for two player games is very limited and "Mr. Madison's War" has my current attention. I've backed off my rating a bit as a result, and unsubscribed from it as I tired of the same old rants there...

After my first play, I'm really impressed. I've not played anything like it.  It expresses it's historical theme with asymmetrical deck building really well. It's less an area-control war game than managed expansion for points. Definitely has a euro feel.  I began to discover the roots of the so-called Halifax Hammer in my first game, but I've thought of a tweak to mitigate that.  Can't wait to get in a few more plays.  Inspiring design.

Least favorite of Martin Wallace's designs.  Attempts to merge a wargame with a Euro game in my opinion and doesn't quite fulfill what I look for from either end of the spectrum.

Great game with some pretty nifty balancing mechanisms.

If you have played Dominion this game will feel similar as far as the card mechanics and "deck building".

It doesn't quite make me feel as tense as some wargames and there isn't as much conflict but there is the tension of never having quite enough resources to do all that it is that you really want to do.

That particular tension is plenty but it makes the game feel more gritty vs edgy.

Nice components (limited edition) ok to play but usually pull out other games when I am playing two player games.

This game has the worst non-paper-money I've ever seen. Yes it is sturdy, easy to distinguish and to handle but it is ugly as hell.

Beside of that the game is a real beauty. Once you know how to play the game and once you realize how to play each side the game is pretty fun.
A few Acres of Snow is a well designed tug-of-war that leaves several ways to win.

I love so much about this game: the theme, the basic deckbuilding/card combat mechanics, the art and the historical feel of the whole thing are all top notch. I have deliberately avoided learning anything about the "Halifax Hammer," so that has no bearing on my opinion of the game.

Unfortunately, the game is very long and slow, the map is a little hard to read, and the fixed setup, though historically inspired, makes the game less interesting and a little more scripted than I would like. I [i]still[/i] wouldn't have a problem with any of this had the game not been totally surpassed by its successor, Mythotopia, which is a much faster and more varied gaming experience IMO, especially with the randomized set-up. Now I will almost always choose Mythotopia over this, so I'm afraid AFAoS is headed towards the sell list. If only Mythotopia had a historical theme...

A rather different take on CDGs, with a twist of Dominion influence leavened by a greap dollop of theme and sensitive design.  Obviously need to play more to get into the subtleties but I have no doubt they're there.  I think it was down to a somewhat timid start and a fairly unaggressive approach - raids apart - that the game stalled somewhat towards the end but the French still scraped a win.  I think there's a few things I could do differently next time, which is always a good sign.

The thing I often find so frustrating about Martin Wallace designs is that he often just seems unwilling to do the work to translate his ideas into good games. AFAoS is probably the most egregious example of a game of his that is a good idea where the real work simply was not done. Gamers in general give designers way too much credit for having good ideas and not enough blame when those good ideas are not really executed on.
---
The rules changes don't seem to have fixed anything. Halifax Hammer is still the way to go. The game is just stereotyped once you figure it out, as almost all Martin Walace games are - his stuff is just too complex compared to the amount of testing that is apparently done. I'm not sure why I thought he would break out of his by now long-established track record of clever, under-developed games, but he hasn't. Sold my copy.
---
Hmm. So the rules have changed, and they've changed a *lot*. The no-location-reserve rule plus increasing raid range to two ... it's pretty huge. Seems like fixing a kink with a giant sledgehammer. I think it'll work, since reserving location cards was a non-trivial part of the original problem, but wow, as a software guy I always prefer the smallest fix possible. This is not a small fix.

On balance, I think I like the idea of AFAoS more than I like the actual game. It's the typical uneven Wallace fare. More interesting than most of his stuff just for being more imaginative, faster-playing, and tighter, but I really don't know if there is actually anything there.

Been playing this on Yucata, which I oddly think is more fun than FtF. I don't generally log internet plays, maybe I should start doing it for games like this.
---
Played once, enjoyed. Not an obviously great game, but a fun deck-builder with a nice historical veneer. Like most Treefrog games, it doesn't feel fully baked - as empires expand, especially the French to the west, it gets a little attenuated and loses momentum because the decks get too hard to wield because of the specific combos required to accomplish anything. Also, the micro-turns feel a little slow as once decks get built up a little bit it takes a bunch of time to do even simple things. Some other nagging persnickety details also. Still, the sum does add up to something interesting, and I hope it has some staying power.

I've been following the discussion of the Halifax Hammer strategy and it's relative broken-ness or not with some interest. I don't know, as I haven't played enough, but my instincts are worried about it. It's a first-principles argument that makes me nervous: basically, all deck-builders are won with tight, small, focused decks if at all possible - which is why the Chapel, and any other early-card-trashing cards are so hugely powerful in Dominion, or the Trainer in Thunderstone (and also why CCGs all have minimum deck sizes of 60 or so).  Unless a game has a systemic drag or something forcing you to acquire cards, small decks always win. Not only does A Few Acrees of Snow have all the normal biases against large decks, it's actually worse than that - as you add more locations, not only do you bloat your deck and make combos harder to draw, you also actually obsolete existing cards in your deck (because they can no longer be used to expand), thus making your deck worse in multiple ways. So if you could win with a very thin deck, you would obviously want to do that. The question is, can the French, through Raids primarily, force enough bloat into the English deck to make a game of it. My real fear is that while it may develop such that the Hammer is the best British strategy, and while it won't always win and the game may develop in interesting other directions after the initial push, it will dominate play enough to stereotype the game and strip away the illusion of choice. This is certainly a very common failing in Wallace games, something that adds to my uneasiness.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 INCOMPLETE play:

Rating is very tentative as we didn't even complete our game. But let me say first, I'm not sure how people complete this in an hour! We were on our second hour and neither of us was near winning when we called it quits. 

I don't THINK we were missing any rules - I think we just kept stalling each other by initiating attacks too early. And I suppose that's my main complaint with the game - the fact that you can even DO that. I guess I prefer games with more of a forced endgame?

Anyway, this game has some good stuff going for it, but it has a pretty high barrier of entry. In general, I like the game conceptually and in practice a lot of what I like works well - the board and combat certainly make it a more interactive deckbuilder. That said, since we mostly weren't pulling from common stacks of cards, on turns when my opponent wasn't making movement on the map I didn't really pay attention to the cards he was drafting. It certainly pays to do so, though.

I like the reserve system a lot, and I like the ability to pay to discard - with only two actions a turn and a solid cash economy, it can be a tense choice and it's a refreshing way to increase your odds of drawing good cards. Both solid additions to the genre.

Now, that barrier of entry I was talking about? The game isn't super complex, but familiarity with the game is kind of a must. Often the beauty of deckbuilders is you know right away what the use of each card you can draft is, so you have a good idea of what actions to expect in your deck. Here, there's just a lot more memorization - you might know New Haven is coming up in your deck, but what actions does it give you, again? If I settle in Albany right now, how does it affect my deck?

There's just something about the design that feels like it lacks elegance. Everything feels just a tad more complex than it needs to be. I'm interested to play a full game again now that I understand things a bit better, but as-is I'd be hard pressed to recommend this over Trains.

RATING: 5
A huge improvement on Dominion in that there is a very solid and interesting theme here. True to history, the sides are quite asymmetric, the make up of their decks being quite different. I was impressed by the gameplay which gives players lots of options. The mechanics are very clever, particularly the use of settlement cards in settling, expanding, fortifying and laying siege actions.

I was not impressed by the wooden town pieces in the deluxe version. They are miniature versions of Settlers pieces. Full-sized ones would have been better. Plastic models (eg. from Kings & Things) would have looked better still. Also the map section of the board could have been enlarged to make better use of the board space.

Notes after one play as the French (which I lost 57-46):

Money was particularly hard to come by (compared to the British). Getting a second Pelt Trader proved useful though I think my income was still less than half that of my opponent who raked in money from trade. Income from piracy was pitiful. 

Fortifying towns as soon as possible (particularly around Nova Scotia) was also very important. 

Enlisting the two Priests was worthwhile as it reduced the number of British raids and allowed me to eventually ambush several expensive units. 

All sieges ended in defeat for the attacker (3 British, 1 French) and the only way to successfully initiate a siege against a well fortified town (starting at defence of 4) would be to play Artillery Support (cost 3) and Military Leader (as a free action) to reduce the siege points to 0. 

In hindsight, I should have picked up a green Settlers card (cost 7) required for settling and developing actions as the only other French card with settlers is the Quebec card whereas the British already have several.

Second game as the British (which I lost 53-36). My single minded strategy of trying to out-build the French failed. I missed the opportunity to settle some of the decent point scoring settlements inland.

I’ve played this a few times online as the French and lost both times. It really is a great asymmgame. Highly strategic and confrontational with many layers of possibilities.

Finding opponents to play with it will be difficult because there is a plethora of actions and familiarity with the cards and sides is needed.

RATING: 5
Rating is based on my first play (I was the French) and I know I did things strategically wrong and will improve my play in the future - which hopefully will increase my rating.  But as it stands, the game I played left me with a 'I can't wait for this to be over' feeling at about the midway point, and I was not out of contention yet. It was not tense and exciting and I didn't care if I was going to win anymore.  Having to pass (I mean discard X 2) four turns in a row, and probably Discarding 15 times in 10 rounds is painfully not fun.  Lesson learned: dont' expand too fast and if your opponent goes heavy military, you dont' have to keep pace.

-A special note on the board, which I found almost useless in planning anything.  The connections between locations are found on the cards, and using the board for this information is crap.  What can attack Louisbourg by looking at the board?  No idea.  Is my opponent one move away from Quebec?  I dunno, let me find the Quebec card.  Sigh.  The board needs work.

Weird mashup of deckbuilding/wargame/abstract set in Last of the Mohicanville.  Like chess, only the way you moved your pieces by placing cards representing both the pieces and the places they can move into a deck that you control. When your strategy changes, you want to get out the pieces and locations that aren't useful to your strategy, otherwise you won't be able to move the pieces you want to very often, but if you do, you leave yourself vulnerable in the places you got rid of.  Delicious in its ability to allow you to screw yourself.

Update: the game is quite broken, sadly.

RATING: 7
:sugar: :( :D There is a dominant strategy. It is real, and it is indeed dominant. It's a design flaw. The game does not work as designed. You will need to find a set of house rules to dodge the problem or intentionally remain ignorant of the degenerate strategy for the game to work.

Apart from that Mrs. Lincoln, how's the play?

It's really good. It's light without being fluffy. There's intriguing strategies to pursue, different theaters to contest, and the two sides are gratifyingly asymmetrical -- the Brits [i]must[/i] attack and keep the French in reactive mode, using their advantageous financial position to build up their military might, ensuring that the French don't have a free hand to develop at will. (Given that free hand, a French victory is inevitable as the tide.)

It's a deckbuilder, but it's a deckbuilder that [i]uses[/i] the mechanic in a thematically coherent matter -- your hand of cards and stock of money limits you in a way that kind of makes sense in a game of development and combat in a trackless wilderness an ocean away from reinforcements and money.

As a French and Indian War sim, Wilderness War crushes this one like a grape. But that's because of a greater degree of detail that is to be expected in a three-hour wargame vs. a ninety-minute Euro. As games -- well, I have a very soft spot for Wilderness War, so I may not be the best judge. But AFAoS holds up. It's quick and appealing. It's not as infinitely variable as Dominion, but it doesn't end up being as samey as you might think with the same cards in the supply every time. If it weren't for that whole dominant-strategy problem, I would recommend it without reservation. With it, I can't do so in good conscience. But there's a good reason why so many people were so invested in trying to save this patient.

Martin does deck-building; and he does it well. I like this implementation of Dominion on a Board where the reward is a physical representation of what you captured.  I like the synergy of playing certain cards together and the asymmetrical nature of the two nations.  The game ended rather abruptly when realized only one type of counter needed to be gone at the start of a players turn, so this will most likely impact our strategies for next time.  Still, final scores were relatively close.  Looking forward to another game soon.

This game rocks.
When I first looked upon a game of FAS I immediately liked the concept and bought the boardgame right away. I assigned to it a poor replay value, I was deadly wrong. After 27 games I've seen a lot of different strategies for the Brits and French alike. Most of all FAS is a game of action/reaction, so you need to adapt to what your opponent is doing, deck managment is capital, but not enough to win consistently. A good map strategy is essential but not nearly enough to snack a win.
Play it!
Fist time I rated it I give it a 7.5, but the rating is increasing with every play.
In the end I played 100+ games of this one before call it quit. My game of the year for 2012

Played a long grinding game of this for 3 hours and didn't finish. I could have killed the game after about 90 minutes but didn't have the points to win. Got to the point it would have been 62-61 (against me) at the end if I had killed the game, which wasn't quite enough. There was a point where if the card draw had gone in my favour rather than Tom's (i.e. I had drawn my military or he hadn't drawn his newly purchased artillery) I would have won. However it didn't pan out and I lost the siege. I then lost a key military card. From this point there was no easy end in sight. There were no raid targets left, and it would have been a race for the indian ambush cards, with Tom trying to build cities and me trying to just take more cubes/discs off him to win the game. 

Didn't enjoy it as much as I'd expected to, which was disappointing.

This is a solid game, and is one my favorite Wallace games of all time.  I still don't know "how" to play this.  It is a deck-building game.  That I have come to the conclusion too, but I don't know to handle this game in that capacity.  Unlike other deckbuilders, I know what cards to trash, but in this one, since your position is often tenuous, you never know.

Really want to like it; keep just getting stuck with no way to finish cleanly.  The fact that the map doesnt show you the paths you can take is criminal, and ruins the game.

Edit: Resorted to drawing the river-based routes for indian invasion on the board with thin black marker.  Along with printouts for each player of how far their cards will reach, you can at least stop wondering why the attack you are planning never comes up...

Edit: And after trading it away, wife asks where it is as she wants to play it.  So I traded it back again.  And it hasn't been played yet.

RATING: 6.75
Wallace's historical game is typical of the 2-player genre - a constant push and pull between the opposing sides, each trying to push far enough to get a win, or in this case until time runs out.

Both the British and the French are trying to settle more towns while at times looking to raid or ambush the opponent, or even siege a town.  To do this you need the right combination of cards.  These are brought into your hand and new cards are purchased in a manner that will be familiar to Dominion players.

Generally I think the game is interesting, but it definitely rewards frequent play, so experienced players will easily dominate.  Also when you get behind, it can be very difficult to catch up, particularly if your deck is full of cards you can no longer use (hint: get the Governor), or you're challenged trying to get money.  I don't mind playing online, but I don't think I need to own this.

Deck building war game. Typical Martin Wallace design. Problems:

Deeper strategy than most other 'wargames', strategy being defined as "What am I doing over the next 6-8 turns in order to win?".  Unlike most other deckbuilding games (ie, Dominion), which are purely questions of 'How fast can I churn my deck?", this one will bite you in the butt if you're not adjusting what you're doing to what your opponent is doing.

As for the 'Halifax Hammer'- its not a problem. Don't let Dominion players convince you otherwise. And if you DO think its a problem, then just match play the game.

Easy Peasey. Definitely one of the more interesting titles I've seen from Martin Wallace in ages, and I'm not that much of a fan of his games.

What a fantastic deck management/area conquest game!  The mechanics are simple yet immersive and the decisions are light-weight but important.  I like how you can "see" what the enemy's strategy is by the cards they are choosing.  I also like the siege mechanic; you end up throwing in many of your cards to try to gain a 2-point strength advantage, but possibly reducing the effectiveness of your deck while many of your good cards are tied up maintaining the siege.  I would play this rather than Dominion any day!

Designer admits this is a Dominion clone...so-deck building with a board - that doesn't quite fly. Rather assymetrical game-that seems to give one side too big an advantage to ever overcome...I think there is talk in the forums of fiddling with one of the decks to help this issue but hey-I DONT WANT TO DO THAT-I want the game to come to me as a well play-tested item....caught

I think this is the best game design in many years, and I truly want this game to be great.  However I can't give it the 10 I want to while it is imbalanced.

If this had been actually playtested to completion by people who knew what they were doing, I would have easily given it the 10 it would deserve

Rating of 4 for "Not so good, it doesn't get me, but could be talked into it on occasion."  

I don't like deck builders, so the core mechanism in this game just doesn't work for me.  Plus, I had a really hard time figuring out how to find the wargame here.  

You can't fight without the right cards, you need to figure out which cards to buy to get in your deck, but I can't stand deck building.  So this game is definitely not for me.  

But a 3 = "bad" and it's not that, it's just not for me.  So it's a 4.  That should be clear enough.

 Not your typical deckbuilding game. Not your typical strategy game. Not your typical wargame. In fact, not even your typical boardgame at all; though there are elements from a variety of all these type of games (I especialy love fight system, which is ingeniously simple/simply ingenious).

 However, even if I can not tell what type of game this is, I can tell with a clear conscience, that it is a fun game in every conceivable regard with tons of possibilities and aproaches.

RATING: 8
An excellent 2 player game.  It is fairly quick to play when you get used to it. It is asymmetrical, there  is plenty of player interaction and there are lots of different strategies to adopt and ways to counter your opponent's strategies. 

This is also another Treefrog game with a great theme. Since playing this game I have read a little about the American theatre of the Seven Years War and I am impressed about how this game reflects many of the major traits of this conflict. This is achieved both through its mechanisms and the design of the game board and cards.  I was pleased when I read about how Louisbourg was a fortified port and then took a look at the board to find that this was represented by a fortification symbol next to the settlement.

Great fun and highly recommended if you like thought provoking games dripping in theme.

I get the feeling it could have been playtested a bit more though.

A very interesting blend of deckbuilding/economic development game and war game.  Players settle or conquer areas to gain the cards for that town, build armies by buying soldiers and try to keep their decks clean.  A game that combines familiar mechanics in new and original ways.  Plus it's fast and fun.
Update - I have reluctantly lowered the rating on this game due to the existance of the Hallifax Hammer strategy.  The game's fun but the existance of a dominant strategy kinda ruins it.

Downgraded from a 10.  The game is broken with the original rules.  If you don't believe me, consider the fact that Martin Wallace himself thought a fix was necessary.  If you still don't believe me, check out out4blood's 99% win percentage with Britain.  

UPDATE: Will try out the official fix soon.

UPDATE 2: Halifax strategy still seems unbalanced with official "fix."  Even if the strategy is blunted somewhat, it doesn't solve the underlying problem that Britain's other strategies aren't worth pursuing, making the game feel scripted.

UPDATE 3: New rules make things suck more for France.  And the 2nd Edition's coming out with the recent "fix" in the rules? I'm glad I was an unwilling playtester; I just want my money back now.

Fabulous, brilliant system, unlike anything else.  Somehow models the challenges each side has very well with a simple card and movement system and a cleverly designed board.  Can't wait for Hands Across the Sea, by another designer who uses this system for the Punic Wars. Supposedly Acres is broken, with a dominant strategy that those who want to be pricks can practice a hundred times and get really good at...I will avoid those people and play it for the marvel that it is.

A very unique concept allows the blend between a deck building and a wargame.
While reproducing an historic event (even if a bit odd) in a stunning visual aspect, there are some real cool mechanics that point out the great creativity of Martin Wallace: The confilt around the siege is perhaps the best exemple, but there are others.
The rulebook could, however, be more explicit, a problem that seems to affect so many of Wallace´s great games...

Good use of deckbuilding to incorporate it with a shared board between players as well as tie it to a wargame scenario. However, at heart, it's still a deckbuilder, and that means a lot of shuffling. There's not much I hate about gaming more than shuffling less than a full deck of cards (i.e. not enough to riffle shuffle). And unfortunately, in most deckbuilders, getting a deck large enough to riffle shuffle means you will likely lose. :(

RATING: 6
Love the design and mechanics. Too bad it's somewhat broken, even with the fixes. Against an expert British opponent the French are probably doomed. If they don't punch you in the face using the Halifax Hammer, they can punch you in the balls by attacking Trois Riviere from ought-not-to-be-connected-directly-to Louisburg and cutting most of your locations off in one fell swoop. To top it all off, most of the fixes in the 2nd edition actually make things [i]worse[/i] for the French.

The British simply have too many advantages in this game. Starting money, income, army size, available settlers and location connections all favor the British. Conversely, it seems there's a single best strategy for the French to counter the vaunted Halifax Hammer. That means at the end of the day, even if the HH is beatable, there appears to be a single best strategy for both players.

I don't want to sound too negative, though. I like the game, and defeating the Halifax Hammer is certainly possible in the hands of less skilled opponents who only have a vague idea how to implement it. The real fun will come for you when you and your friends are just learning the game, and you'll get a bunch of fun plays in where you're trying all sorts of wacky stuff to figure out what works and what doesn't.

Just don't play this at tournaments.

Continues to be a solid game and moves up the charts. Going to play with a score track the next time.

[October 2014 - 8.7]
I've only played two games, but boy do I like it. For starters, its card management is a bit different than most deck-builders in that you have to hang onto the cards you don't use, and then can only draw back up to the limit. This slows down the game, but adds great strategy and inner debate -- "do I hang onto this card for when I dearly need it, or do I blow it now for the coins ... how soon will I see it again?" The game gives you the sense of slowly building up your forces, part of the early American wars theme. I also love how one card can be so valuable at one point and so worthless at another. It really brings some emotions -- "argh, I hate this, but dammit I love it." It's hard to explain. Every other part of the game -- from city developments to sieges -- brings on that same sense of struggle and having to build up. It's also a game of potential comebacks -- I've been on the brink of defeat and have come back to win. I have only played the British in my first two plays. It's not overly long, but you have to be ready to settle in and play this game.

An interesting deck building concept and a beautifully produced game that reflects the actual history of the Seven Years War in America well, but it somehow left us feeling a bit flat.

Extremely clever deck builder tied into the military and geographic Anglo-French rivalry in 18th century N.America. The way the mechanics tie into the theme is a work of near geniius.

As the rules come out of the box they are not quite robust enough to prevent players using 'extreme' strategies that can threaten game balance - not enough of a problem to spoil what is a great game - and hopefully an official rule change will be forthcoming to close the loophole.

RATING: 8
Preliminary rating of 8 after an hour of our first incomplete game.

This game seems to be what everyone is saying! A brilliant and impressive merger of Dominion-esque eurogame mechanics into a deep engaging strategic situation.

I can easily see this being a 9 or 9.5 if further play confirms these first impressions.

Edit: Rating increased to 8.5 based on several more plays today (Aug 27/11). 

Second Edit: Rating increased to 9. There are layers of strategy involved in this game (esp with cards and locations) which only surface after repeated play. Brilliant design. Much deeper than it first looks. (September 17th, 2011)

Third Edit: Rating stays at 9 despite the "broken" thin deck furor - which I think is overdone. (October 16th, 2011)

Fourth Edit: Rating increased to 10 after Martin's rule changes to stop the British thin deck "broken"/boring strategy. Great game and best game design concept in a long time.

Fifth edit: Rating reduced back to 9 after playing 1812: The Invasion of Canada! Both are great games! Can't wait for the next games which use these excellent systems!

Most ugly board I have ever seen. Anyhow - the graphics on most of the card can be considered as simply missing. The game itself is rather easy to understand - not necessarily easy to master. However quality of the production...well, should be better! I like it, but better graphics would definitely improved the experience.

RATING: 5
Players are either the British or French, rapidly expanding north west North America, trying to defeat the opposition.  Large scale game covering about a hundred years, culminating in the French and Indian War.  This is a bit of an odd one, basically a deck building game where the cards are used to perform actions that can broadly be categorized as "Settling", "Fighting", "Money and Management", and "Extras".  Players on their turn take two actions from the dozen or so available, and expansion rapidly occurs as settlements and towns creep across the board.  Players will eventually bump into each other, which kicks off the raids, sieges, ambushes and so on.  While this is going on, player decks are increasing and thus diluting, so players are forced into tricky juggling tricks such as using the reserve (a holding space for cards), managing money (cards and actions can cost you) and such.  Clean game, much easier to get into than the usual over-engineered Wallace games that leave you with the feeling it wasn't worth the effort.  Having played almost every Wallace game since Stockers, this definitely feels up there with his best, such as Steam.  Very good, pity it's broken.

I've played 6+ games of this online at Yucata.de. (I only record physical plays on BGG) What an excellent game, I love coming up with a strategy and seeing to fruition or reacting to an opponents strategy. 

Regarding the "broken" British strategy: I've never tried implementing it but I have played once responding to that strategy..and luckily stopping it. I think there are many strategies in the game to explore without using that particular one.

OK, I probably didn't give this game a very fair shot, but it felt to me like trying to pick up jello while wearing oven mitts.  I love deck building, but here, it just seemed to make doing anything difficult in a way I did not at all enjoy.  Consequently, playing it more is not something I am eager to do.  My mind rejected this game like my stomach with a bad burrito.

Played once and it is truly an excellent game with a huge variety of options to go for.  The asymmetry of the game makes for really interesting differences between the two sides.  Fortunately this is not a wargame in the traditional sense but instead a highly sophisticated card/board game with a real sense of historical atmosphere.  It is nearly as good as London, the best game of the last 12 months.  Martin Wallace is on fire.

Rating gone down now...not paying back on repeated plays.

Light historical wargame that has a familiar deckbuilding mechanic.  I don't think I've seen another light wargame that used deckbuilding, and I really like this combination.

Last night we played our first game and it was not without its bumps.  Altogether we spent 4 hours learning the rules and playing our first game.  My husband took the French and I was the British.  He started the game in good spirits and spoke only French on his turn.  Unfortunately our game kept getting interrupted.  Our daughter was being extremely annoying and needed a good hour's worth of extra attention.  Many times we had questions regarding gameplay that required consulting the rules and found no clear answer.  For instance, if your location is involved in a seige, can you still launch a raid from there?  If you have a location card in your deck, but no longer have a settlement or town at that location, can you still use it to launch a seige?

At this point, we were close to two hours into our 'game' and had each purchased maybe 3 empire cards and founded 1-2 settlements.  The game began to grate on my husband's nerves as he realized it had a very unforgiving learning curve.  He felt he had made some early mistakes in his card selection and couldn't stop dwelling on it.  We got through the next hour and I guess at this point we were both incredibly exhausted or maybe we finally hit on how to play the game because suddenly it was very fun again, just like at the beginning on the game.  Ultimately, the game ended with my husband placing all his settlements on the board.  The French were victorious, the final score being 58-50.

What we learned:

- Maybe we don't understand 'war games'; neither of us were great at seiges, and rarely was a raid successful. 

- You should really take a look at the location card before you choose to found a settlement.  Some cards are just going to be dead in your deck; they give you little to no options on using them later.  

- Purchasing empire and neutral cards need to be careful decisions.  Don't rush a card into your deck before you are ready for it (fur trader, I'm looking at you!)

- The reserve is crucial to launching a successful seige.  You can't count on drawing the attack cards you need to continue your battle so be prepared! 

My thoughts on the game:

It was hard, and frustrating, and damnit, I loved every second of it.  I was up all night in bed, laying awake, going over the different cards in my head.  There have only been a few games in my life that have captivated my mind as much as this one.  I am desperate to play it again and get better.

RATING: 7
A fantastic two player struggle to expand and conquer, all done through careful card play with asymmetrical decks. This game appears to have many strategies that can be tested and honed over repeated plays. The errata and rule changes make for a tighter game without runaway leaders, but there were a fair amount of questionable design and production decisions that drag my rating down.

This is an interesting game that's a hybrid between a war game and a deck building game.  The only thing I can say at this point is that the game shipped with a broken strategy for one of the factions to able to win over 90% of the games.  As it's broken I can only rate it a low value.  It should be rated lower but had this not been an issue, I could see rating it quite highly so it will get the max score a broken game can receive.  Despite Martin Wallace working on fixing the issue, my rating likely will not change as I no longer own the game and won't likely re-purchase it regardless of whether he fixes the issue or not.

RATING: 10
One word:  Wow!  Marrying deckbuilding to a push-pull wargame was fantastic design by Martin Wallace.  Impressive too in that the British and French decks are very different, but the game is very balanced in spite of this asymetry.  Very strong and well applied theme, despite being a card game - not a war game!

The Halifax Hammer is not a really a problem and there are fixes and simple house rules to restrict a player from trashing  most of his cards.  After this, there's no guarantee a water invasion will succeed by game end and although this was the historical path taken by the British during the war, there are many other paths to victory: seizing Quebec by land (instead of water) or else on points by blocking the French settlement.  The French have a vey good chance of winning too, by establishing forts in the Ohio River Valley and wearing the British down.

Highly recommended as a great advancement on the deckbuilding genre.

This game is interesting.  The evolution of mechanics is to its credit but can't overcome the obvious limitations of the design.  Most critically the lack of any meaningful random element renders this little more than a puzzle (obviously solvable) with the occasional [predictable] interaction between players.  

I can see why it's popular - it's the euro of wargames...  That's why I'm not really a fan.  This is destined to be the inspiration for some great games in the future that do it all better.

Much deeper than I thought it would be considering it uses deck building as a jumping off point. My initial play was fraught with analysis paralysis. Unlike Dominion, where your deck building is restricted to the cards available, in this game every card is available from the beginning. Each turn you take two actions and there are also about a dozen actions to choose from. Choosing what action, what cards to use, and where on the board to do the action is a lot to consider. I really liked the asymmetry of the two sides.

I'm not a huge fan of war games, but I liked what 2 de Mayo did with asymmetrical card-driven play a fair bit better. The deck-building and map aspects here feel a bit more disjoint, and combat seems more infrequent and less brisk than what I would expect, going into this kind of game.

Want to play this more.  Nice combination of a deckbuilding game and a wargame.  A few fiddly rules I don't like (ex. remembering after you lost a city that those cards can't be used), but overall very nice.

A Few Acres of Snow is a deck building combat game. I traded before playing and was happy to have discovered it. It offers multiple paths to victory and has enough to consider to be a medium weight game.

I'll miss my friend, Tim Seitz, and always associate this game with him. Tim loved this game and spent countless hours playing and trying to refine it. He offered to play me on Yucata so I could try out some rule variants, but I never did unfortunately. Game on, Tim.

UPDATE from MW:

1. Remove the French bateaux card from the initial deck and place it with the available cards.

2. Reserve - you cannot place location cards in your reserve.

3. Raids - the raid distance is now two connections plus one connection for each additional card played (so playing two Native American cards would allow you to raid a location up to three connections away).

4. Home Support - you can only take cards from your draw deck, so if you had fewer than three cards available you would only be able to draw these. Consequently, the only time you shuffle your discard pile is when you need to refill your hand at the end of the turn and your draw deck is exhausted.

Is it a wargame? WHO CARES! This game surpasses it's deck building roots by giving you a reason to develop a strategy and interact fully with your opponent.

The idea of marrying deck building to a tactical board game is great. The result, however, is the usual Wallace hodgepodge of ideas (of late) where some of the gears engage and others spin pointlessly.

The area around Louisbourg becomes a hot spot since Louisbourg is a key gateway to Quebec. It's such a hotspot that it is ultimately a distraction from any other plans you might have for the game; reduced to settling and developing territories when you're not swatting military flies. And maybe that's accurate historically, but it's a huge distraction here.

The whole native Americans and raiding piece will only ever make sense if both players are pursuing a relatively peaceful settlement strategy with no emphasis around Louisbourg.

So, still trying to figure out if it's ultimately a good game or not. Right now it's interesting, with promise, but I've been burned by too many Wallace promises.

[Update]
Played a proposed (possibly official) fix and it makes the game a good bit better by making raids more viable. So you don't just have to match each other in how you play; there are some options now.

subscription 2010/due March 2011/Martin Wallace, signed & numbered

This is an area control war game with a very unique and smart deck-building mechanic. Martin Wallace has again incorporated his historical interests into a thematically rich encounter, this time between the French and the British in North America.   A very asymmetric design lays the foundation for multiple strategies and results in re-playability.  

All the deck building games I have played (which is almost all of them) rely on thinning the deck for faster, slicker wins. This one is no different, however, as the game changes, the needed composition of the deck does too, perhaps at some point even reverting, and those cards which might have earlier become useless and discarded can be re-entered into the hand.  I find that the deck in this game needs to be more flexible, and that I need to be ready to adapt quickly to changing game conditions. 

The main objection I have to this game is that it takes so long to play--one of the strong points for me of deck building games is that they most often are fast and furious.  Even if  I play this enough (and I am sure I will) to reduce the game play to an hour as the box suggests,that is still longer than I like to spend on a 2-player, deck-building game.  It is a disadvantage, but not a big one.  

Martin Wallace has again designed an original game, one that deviates from his other game designs.  This fresh game is another added to the long list that underscores his credibility as an important, premier game designer.

Limited edition (#231)

Very clever, thematic and tense game.

Clever because of the deck-building: it is smoothly integrated into the game, it brings a lot of choice and combinations, it simulates the required delay between the gain of a card and its use. The sieges are very well simulated : pretty abstract but not too much. Brillant !

Thematic because of the asymmetry between :
- french and english decks
- costal (ships, settlers and money) and inland (bateau, fur) locations

Tense because the game makes you involved all the time. It is a "take that" game, makes of sudden raids, piracy, sieges, ambushes to weaken your opponent.

This game is a matter of timing and choices : you must pay attention to your deck's efficiency not to reach your goals but also to adapt to your opponent dirty tricks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very nice blend of asymmetric deckbuilder, euro and light wargame with a fitting theme (the battle between France and Great Britain for the control of upper North America).

The game can end by conquest, raiding, settling or expanding your colonies. The cards dictate which actions you can take. They are either locations on the board (which are acquired by settling) or special cards bought from the empire deck, like natives, fortifications, infantry or artillery.
Managing the deck and knowing which cards are coming and which your opponent holds in his hand is vital to success. Settling too much will fill your deck with useless godforsaken locations that will slow you down; hiring too many natives may make you adept to raiding and ambushing, but sooner or later they'll fill your hand and you'll wish you had never hired them. The same can be true for your military: it's awesome for sieging, but at the end of a siege everything will be dumped into your discard pile and will return in your deck to haunt you. The governor is a card you'll learn to love: he will bring the needed order and discipline to your deck, allowing you to remove unwanted or unneeded cards and return as slim and fit as ever.

The game's balance has been questioned and it has been shown that the British hold a decisive advantage, but it's hard to execute the perfect strategy, and I think the game is still very interesting.

I really like this game.  So fun to play.  Wallace's "fix" for the "Halifax Hammer" makes it better, but doesn't actually fix it.  This game is 10 if somehow it wasn't broken.  As it is, I still really like it.

I really enjoy playing this game. The way that a deck building mechanism, that is tightly integrated with the theme of the game, has been woven into a light wargame. Except it's not really a war game, it's about supply and logistics. It's a really nice package, cosmetically as well. It looks lovely on the table.

I was aware of the issues with the HH but avoiding reading about it. I think that we did eventually work out how to roughly implement it after a number of games but probably not as efficiently as other, more proficient players. Still, the vague knowledge of this did funnel the British down this route and large areas of the board were rarely visited.

Then we started to play the official variants and this opened up the game entirely. More variety, different goals, different tactics.

I can't see myself tiring of this one.

This is rated based on play testing, which I enjoyed, but thought took too long for what it was. The designer reliably informs me that if you really push for win conditions it should only require half an hour!

This is a sublime game. Lots of frisson when I took off my first enemy settlement. Holy cow, I just hired a bunch of thugs to wipe out a settlement. 

Instead of a wargame, I like to think of this as an empire building game. It helps me get in the mindset that allows this game to stretch across several centuries, and I think that helps teach the game to new people too.

I really love that game. IMO it perfectly combines deck building with area control/war game. "Trains" tries something similar but IMO never reaches the depth of AFAOS.
 
Since you have to keep unused cards on your hand for the next turn (unless you're willing to spend 1 of your actions) there are a lot of tough decisions to make.

Good timing is a huge factor and makes it even a little more interesting to me than Dominion.

I know there is an ultimate strategy to blow away the French. But I really don't care about it. Every game I played so far was very different from the previous ones. I've won games with very different strategies and I also lost with different strategies (with both the French & the British).

This game has lots of replayability. Unfortunately it is only a 2 player game. But that really is the only downer to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Strategy feels very limited by the way combat is performed. Because of the way sieges work, a player has to mount a defense as soon as the other player makes an attack. Then because of how players' assets become tied up in that siege, simultaneous offensives seem nearly impossible (save a simple base race, of course, if you don't defend any battles). Accruing lesser defenses will allow those assets to remain bound in that combat, but both players will have a similar amount of effort put into both attack and defense, making that attrition pointlessly luck-based.
Raiding is a frustrating experience since in order to prevent a raid, a player has to be lucky enough to have a particular card in hand when the opponent decides to raid.
More than anything else, it is regrettable that the Halifax Hammer so totally invalidates any other strategy and that it is not contra to the sensibilities of other deck building games.

Absolutely outstanding deck building, card-driven weuro hybrid game.  Probably the best Martin Wallace game yet. I hate deck builders, but this one actually made the mechanic compelling. It is nicely balanced and the mechanics and interactions are brilliantly subtle and interesting. It has some great tension as well. It might run a bit long, but neither of us minded.

Two games as the French so far.  Fantastic game with two sides that must play quite differently to win.  I think the key as the French is to raid, raid, and raid some more early on before the British can fortify or spread out to too many towns that earn VP.  It can bog down a bit if the decks get too large and no one plays aggressively.  At a certain point in the last game, I could have ended it by winning one battle or successfully raiding one more town, but I knew I didn't have enough points - that is when the game slowed to a crawl as I tried desperately to expand my territory into VP towns, but it was nearly impossible with only one Settler card in my deck.  Still, I found the game to be even more fun than Hannibal (which I greatly enjoy as well) and I found to be much more enjoyable than the more complex Twilight Struggle.

RATING: 5
Played a few deck builders and found them to get rather mechanical after a few games. I was hoping that the added tactical element would help add a bit more to think about. But, ultimately it is about cycling through you cards as quick as you can to get to the ones you need, which really drags. There is also that nagging feeling that the HH is going to be discovered sooner or later. Just knowing it exists takes the shine off things.

Played this game an awful lot in a very short period of time and went from loving it to selling it within a month of buying it.

It is a very clever game engine, and concept but the balance and variety in the game are disappointing. 

I'm not slating the game just because of the Halifax Hammer but that is a problem as I struggle to see reasons for the Brits to play any other way. I've been able to get France to win by reverse hammer but river assault or colonization but for Britain colonization isn't really a viable option.

RATING: 5
After a trip to the coast where we played this pretty much non-stop for two days, I feel qualified to call FAoS very very good. Unlike all those other deckbuilding games out there, this is filled with interaction, conflict, and excitement. Fast-moving with tense decisions. Like a Netrunner set in the 18th Century. 

If it weren't already apparent by now, Martin Wallace is a game designer maestro. 

Update: More plays only strengthen my appraisal. Few Acres is a brilliant design and a solid classic. Raised my rating.

Update: After the sad discovery of the unbeatable British siege strategy, I have no choice but to lower my rating. Until this matter can be repaired, the game no longer functions as designed.

Update: The anticipated rules fix by Martin Wallace seems more a band-aid than a fix. As he himself has stated, any game of this sort without game-to-game base rule changes has an inherent dominant strategy.

RATING: 7
Deck building driven by a board game - there are no piles of cards in a poole from which to buy. Rather you add cards by establishing settlements or conquering your opponents settlements (adding a "location" card for the settlement) or use an action to draft, and pay for, cards that you need from a single poole pile of cards from which you can select whatever card your strategy requires. Cards allow you to expand your domaine by adding settlements (initially villages that can be upgraded to towns for double points at game end), or you can attack your opponent by sieging or raiding his settlements or ambushing him to make him remove cards from his deck. Most cards serve multiple purposes as defined by easy to identify and understand icons. Component quality is outstanding (I had the pre-order copy of the game with the wooden bits). I hope that this is the beginning of a whole series of this type of game.

Unfortunately a balance issue appears to have broken the game - bugger.

At first there seemed to be soooo many possible actions that the AP in this game would be killer.

Sometimes it is....and yet, overall it gives me that same vibe as playing Twilight Struggle towards the mid-endgame. It's much tighter quarters and the rules are easier to understand and digest. It's a brilliant game with a unique theme that works! (Not too many games about Canada...?)

Many people complain that there is a 'broken' strategy, and I URGE you to ignore reading anything about that! Enjoy this game, it's a really great design that deserves to be explored! (Twilight Struggle + Dominion = A Few Acres of Snow...without a doubt!)

I can appreciate the details and work put into this game.  It is beautiful, and the asymmetrical nature is brilliant.  Biggest gripe is a) I suck at it and more importantly b) while I don't think it is broken, there are certain strategies that are borderline indefensible, barring them getting crappy hands.  This is a game that really shines when you have two great players duking it out, because only then do you actually see the potential.  It's like chess, it is more fun the better you are at it.  Makes me want to try Wallace's other games.

Broken? Probably, seems that the Halifax Hammer is almost unstopable against a skilled briths player, but the game itself is absolutely brilliant. So far I still have not lose the illusion of getting a HH fix, and on the other hand I am nothing but a newbie player and I am not able to do it correctly, so HH is no issue yet. If it is in the future I will downgrade the rating. So far, I am playing with the new 2nd edition rules and I will try some ideas from the geeks, like giving a -2 to all the amphibious assaults. We will see what happens but so far, well, superb game.

This was a solid "9" when I first started playing it. It was a deep, strategic Euro/war game based on a deckbuilding mechanic. Unfortunately the game was essentially "solved" for nearly-guaranteed British victory by following a relatively easy script from the beginning of the game (with no known French counter at this time), and I haven't been able to play it since. I'm awaiting a rules tweak from the designer before trying to play again (and rating it).

I've never explored the Halifax Hammer. I'm sure if I were smart enough to figure out that strategy on my own, I'd be sorely disappointed.

For me, the problem seems to be that there's just not that much to discover. Don't go through Kennebec. Attack from this direction or the other direction. That's it.

Those first few games are great, however, as you come to learn how it works.

Nice game with gorgeous artwork. It moves quickly because you have only 2 actions per turn. The map was mildly irritating beccause there's no way to know how one place is connected to another until you actually have the card in hand. Everything else about the game was well designed and beautiful to look. Pleasantly thematic, with the cards being perfectly suited to simulate the historical conflict (this is something I value in a game). I don't see myself playing this more than half a dozen times, however, as the map and it's connections really limit what you can do. Still, half a dozen times is a success in my book.

A really fantastic blend of deck-building and board placement. The available actions seem overwhelming when first learning the game, but you quickly realize how much your hand limits what you can do. That makes the decision tree much more manageable.

First impressions are very favourable.  This game seems to have very high replay value as new strategies can be explored from either side of the battle.  The deck building aspect of the game is very well integrated and brings just enough randomness to an otherwise very strategic game.  Looking forward to future plays.

Halifax Hammer issue aside, after 4 plays, my rating dropped 1 point to 8 because the asymmetry doesn't feel balanced and god dammit I can't win no matter which side I'm playing! lol

RATING: 9
Very nice and thematic asymmetric game. Actions are to a large degree determined by the limited card hand. Therefore, the deck needs to be not only built up but also controlled and managed - something that is only possible to a limited degree. 

I really like the fact that the available cards focus the actions on the game board. This makes deck bulding a purposeful endeavour for a purpose other than itself. Thumbs up! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like this system and would love to see it used for other battles that cover territory (like Market Garden).  The location cards (you can only use actions available to that location) especially help simulate not having whatever type of supplies you want.  You have to work with the places you control.  It isn't as much of a "deckbuilder" as billed, but it does have that aspect, which allows you to tailor a strategy.  Recommend for history fans (especially of the period as it's a great simulation) and casual wargamers who like games like Memoir '44, etc.

Martin Wallace comes up with really unique designs and this one is no exception. If this game is really as good as I think it is - which I can only find out by playing it more - firstly the rate will go up to 10, secondly, this will be my favourite, second to Brass and Perikles, Wallace's design.

Update, 3rd August 2011: after 3 plays I have to say, it's been very long since I last couldn't stop thinking of a game. Seems like AFAoS touched long forgotten string. One of the best games I've ever played. Period.

I am a sucker for Seven Years War games, so I had to have this.

It started out very strong ('10') and then fell off the cliff by game 6 when we realized there was only one effective strategy for each side.  This was independent of the whole HH debate on BGG.

I never did play with the rules updates.  In my mind, they might balance the game, but they won't fix the problem that there aren't enough different ways to play the game well.

Basically, the French need to have a develop fast, while the British need to advance to Quebec through Louisberg.  Alternative strategy (French military/raids, British advances through Ohio Forks/Oswego/Crown Point) either doesn't work at all, or is too slow.

I love the theme and the core mechanics of the game.  I've read that it's "broken" and there is a perfect strategy.  I choose to ignore that and won't read anything about what that actually is.

Like almost all Wallace games, it's a little rough around the edges--more options than choices, and some things are just never worth taking. That said, it's definitely one of his cleanest designs.
More importantly, this is really the first time someone's done something truly innovative with the core Dominion idea. I really like Thunderstone, but let's face it--it's basically Dominion. This is not. Who knew that the deck-builders could run a really tight wargame? And I love the theme; the Seven Years War is a favourite subject of mine, and Wilderness War left me cold. 
[EDIT] Ugh, Halifax Hammer! Whether it is broken per se or merely apt to make the game repetitive, it is a serious problem. Did Mr. Wallace play any deck-building games at all? Did he not understand anything about deck-trimming?

This is a 2-player game that seems a little like a war game (because you can play a military strategy to raid/ambush/besiege your opponent).  However, the game can end if a player develops all their villages into towns, for example, and then it goes by how many points each player has on the board (and in captured towns/villages).

The cards for each side are very different -- the British get a lot of money from their original cities, whereas the French get a lot from trader beaver pelts and even playing Piracy on the British.  Since the French have so few cards with settlers (only Quebec, not even any Empire cards in their own deck), it is imperative that they pay 7 to recruit at least one neutral (green) Settlers card, or even both of them.

Rules note: you can't put a location card in your Reserve, only Empire cards (whether your own colour or neutral green ones).

From playing online at yucata.de -- this seems like a very innovative take on deck-building (a genre that I'm less keen on). While talk of the Halifax Hammer has blown this game into dubious territory, the online version allows for user-generated solutions to be implemented.

These days I can usually sum up my feelings on a game pretty well after one play. Not so with A Few Acres. The learning curve here is longer than that, and I just don't have a very good grasp of what I should be doing. I'm told there's a potentially gamebreaking strategy where the British buy up the available settlers before the French can afford them, dooming the French player to a slow and torturous defeat. That could be an issue. Card balance may be another. So this game remains a big question mark for now, but I'd be willing to try again to see if it starts to make some more sense.

Wow at first i was really impressed.. and now i'm flabbergasted as to how Martin Wallace could have not playtested the english rush-Louisbourg strategy.. the game is !officially! broken. It is not fixable & thus there is no way i'm able to play this game anymore :(

No. Finally agreed to play it...resisted for a LONG time....

Some clever ideas here (I like some of Wallace's designs)...and the bits are cool, BUT quality of game play and depth of strategy are very, very limited. Where's the element of chance? Combat very deterministic. And, then there is the issue of British hammer; can't see how that didn't come up in playtesting  given the limited nature of this game.

Also, the BGG rating of this game making it the 24th highest wargame ever is exhibit A for the cult of the new and why games published now need a muffler in the ratings. So, this game is better than Wilderness War, really? Not in my wargamer tribe.

It is deck-building combined with a card driven game. Very hard to get a good working deck combination. And even harder to keep it. Both players are in a permanent dilemma.

If you play it as a cosim, the degree of simulation is like of the most card-driven games. With the difficult task of deck-building, Martin Wallace simulates the difficult task of logistics.

Martin Wallaces games are very hit/miss with me. I either end up loving them or hating them

This one has all the potential for me to love it. I was recommended it basically as 'dominion the war game' and it's true its a deck driven war game.

But it's rules are horribly overcomplicated with several different actions available each turn. But the actions themselves seem a little bit obtuse to me

Given that the starting positions are a bit uneven it seems the game isn't quite balanced either. I'm only 3 games in but would I be right in thinking the British win more often than not?

It has occured to me that the French can only win if they are able to maximise the impact of the areas where they hold an advantage (Piracy/trading)

(11/14/12) Initial play. This is a fascinating coupling of a deck-building mechanism with a spatial aspect, to convincingly convey the "fog of war". Martin Wallace has said that he always starts with a theme, and develops game mechanisms around the theme. There is hardly a fleeting thought that any of his designs are simply game mechanisms with pasted on themes, which tends to be the case with most Euro designs. Wallace succeeds, most impressively, on a number of levels with [i]A Few Acres of Snow[/i].

The rules and game mechanisms are quite simple, although the decision tree is involved. Due to the sheer number of choices, it is possible to be overwhelmed at first, but with a few turns play becomes straightforward and quick. What continues to linger after play is how rich and immersive the game play was, and that the design was able to convey that feeling with very few rules and components. The deck-building aspect faithfully recreates the uncertainties of war, especially conflict in the frontiers of northern New England / Canada, during the French-Indian War. A player could draft additional troops or specific cards, but with the deck-builder, it could be some time before he could make use of such a card. The same player could colonize a strategic location on the board and receive a location card, but again, it could be some time before he could see the card and thus activate a neighboring town for expansion. Players could elect to draft neutral cards depicting Indian forces, for unpredictable and chaotic raids along the frontier, for equally devastating effect.

Everything in this game simply works, and works well. Both of us enjoyed the British/French conflict narrative unfold before our very eyes. Starting with the major cities, both sides would slowly expand into the frontier, until they were literally a town away from making violent contact. Sieges and raids were modeled abstractly, but effectively conveyed the feel. It quickly became apparent that management was important, finding the equivalent "Chapel", or "Council" card, to thin the deck, or to bring more cards into play. Cycling through the deck was a furious and frantic affair on both sides, searching for key cards to settle, lay siege, reinforce, raiding, fortifying, and so forth. Would I be able to get a "fortification" card in time and build up defenses, before my opponent launched a siege against a key city? Did my opponent have a card or two, to counter my raid? Was it worth more to raid his shipping lanes and keep him poor, or was it worth more to use the same card to settle a key location on the board? Delicious, dicey decisions abound on both sides, where every action was fraught with uncertainty and tension.

While I am keenly aware of the "Halifax Hammer", which is supposed to break this game, we were not experienced enough to recognize it. It may become apparent with a number of plays, but I am prepared to switch over to the new rules when the time comes. The game is as enjoyable as my first plays of London, which is another brilliant Wallace design focusing on card/hand management. It is easy to see why this game has received so much attention, with plenty of passionate discourse on the various forums; it has all the hallmarks of a "great" game and/or great game design, despite the one mentioned flaw. I'm looking forward to playing it again. My initial rating is an '8'.

Pow! This is where it's at, man. Few Acres takes deckbuilding from being a novelty (a novelty I do enjoy) to establishing it as a full-fledged and flexible mechanic, where the building of decks makes thematic sense and is worked into a robust experience. I think that this game is going to signal the beginning of big things as other designers get hip to the possibilities...

Martin Wallace does Dominion, and like most of MW's games it's not as elegant as its immediate competitors. It's an oddball wargame, where your actions are limited to the cards you draw from a deck you build. It can be heavy weather getting anywhere as to move (for example) you need both a location card and a means of transport appropriate to your destination, and getting both cards in your hand simultaneously can be a frustrating experience. One major flaw is that the French should have their own 'Settlers' card as the English can grab both neutral copies near the start and this seriously restricts the French player's options. I've pretty much given up on Martin Wallace these days, his games contain good initial ideas, but there's never enough refinement for his games to really shine. This does nothing to change my opinion.

Combina la mecánica de los DBG (que encaja como un guante) con un control de áreas convirtiéndolo en un Dominion cuyas cartas de Finca sirven para algo. Es más euro que wargame y me encanta la mecánica de la Reserva (apartar cartas para usarlas después con cierto costo en monedas). PROS: Juego equilibrado si cada bando se dedica, en lineas generales, a lo mejor que sabe hacer (inglés: reclutar soldados y atacar y francés expandirse y defenderse con asaltos). CONS: Hay que conocerse las cartas para jugar bien. No tan elegante como su inmediato competidor (Dominion). DBG + comienzo asimétrico suele desembocar en juegos rotos, como estuvo este hasta la publicación de las modificaciones de reglas oficiales.

This game combines the Deck Building Games´s mechanics (it fits perfectly) with an area control mechanic that becomes it in a kind of Dominion game whose VP´s cards are useful. It´s more "euro" than "wargame" and I love the Reserve (keep cards to use them before with a cost payed in coins). PROS: well balanced game (only if the players make the most of their roles - British recruiting soldiers and attacking and French expanding and defending from British using assaults). It´s not as ellegant as Dominion. DBG + assimetrical beginning usually end in a broken game, just like this and the Halifax Hammer. The modification of the rules tries to fix it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
So here's my take on the whole Halifax Hammer issue: how you feel about it and the effect it has on A Few Acres of Snow is largely dependent on you as a gamer.  If you are someone who ruthlessly pursues the best strategy by any means necessary (and from what I understand, HH is a series of moves that need to be followed very specifically in order to work, and is very difficult to figure out without researching it on the forums) and refuse to deviate from that strategy because it is "the best one", then AFAoS is probably not for you.  If, however, you are able to put aside (okay, fine, [i]ignore[/i]) the controversy and explore the game on your own terms, you will probably be as taken in by the game's charms as I was.  I'm not casting judgement on either position, just saying that the existence of the Halifax Hammer is enough to disqualify it as a game worth playing for a certain percentage of people, while for others it will be a complete non-issue.

Which is a shame, really, because this is really a great game.  The integration of the deck building and wargaming is incredibly seamless and satisfying, the theme and overall look of the game is superb, and the game is strategically and tactically interesting while not being overly weighty.  It's Martin Wallace at his best - innovative use of mechanics perfectly meshed with an interesting historical theme to create a compelling gaming experience.

This game is quite pleasant, the mechanic is good. I tend to dislike deck building games when it's actually just for the sake of deck building, but this one provides a good theme and a way to actually use your deck building as a part of a strategy to beat the opponent.

I was quite pleased at this game on the first couple of hours playing, until I found out how broken the game is. I felt it when playing the French, and even more when playing the English. There's an unbeatable strategy there that, if followed by the English, will lead you to automatic victory as the reds. Even a somehow lucky and capable blue player will only delay the inevitable. 
The designer provided some adjustments that were supposed to correct this, but they actually didn't.

Once discovered and exploited, this flaw is fatal. No point in playing this anymore.

Excellent 'hybrid' deck-building / wargame.

Dominion was a solid "proof of concept" for the deckbuilding game mechanic.

Thunderstone and Ascension advanced the concept by giving you a reason to build your deck.

A Few Acres of Snow fully integrates the mechanic as part of legitimate card-driven wargame.  Fantastic.

Update: After about 20 plays, feels like I have hit a lot of the various strategies . . . even with the new rules modifications from the original version, military conflict over Halifax appears extremely important for both sides.  The British may also be a bit overpowered.  [Dropped my rating a little bit.]

Although I appreciate the way the deck-building aspect of the game reflected the difficulties of war in this era - spending a long time to get requested aid, needing to supply all areas you control - it was not fun.

The mechanics of this game are completely unlike anything else I've played and, although slightly abstract, the concept lends itself well to what little I know about the historical challenges of this conflict.

EDIT 2:
Martin Wallace himself: "Yes, it is flawed. It is not something that can be fixed absolutely. The best way forward is to keep changing the rules, with scenarios, to present new challenges".

Upon publishing (supposedly) fixed rules Wallace wrote:
"Changing the rules is effectively the same as the changing card combinations in Dominion."
MEGA LOL!!! :D

Quote of the century...

--

I'm amazed when people stress what an original and fresh design it is.  This is - really - pretty standard design in deck-building genre...

It would've been the same rating as Dominion as it is, in fact, Dominion with the map added and set in the historical framework.

BUT:

Many different approaches and strategies seemed to exist in the game.  That is until always successful British strategy was found. In short - the games is BROKEN (-> RATING DOWN ACCORDINGLY).

Even if not that broken strategy, the problem is - for me - that I have no desire to explore potential strategies and possibilities here.  I'm just no deck-building fan and in addition the game is very very abstract, only loosely connected to its historical background.

Not the game for me.

RATING: 7
Well after much deliberation and months of watching the HH threads I finally decided to pick it up and play it for myself. Also, while it seemed that no perfect solution was found, some workable ones were definitely cropping up and that was enough for me to take the leap since I have no fear of tinkering. So I never did pay attention to what the HH was exactly in case I bought the game, and it never came into play to my knowledge in first game. 

So the first thing that struck while reading the rules was THESE ARE THE BEST TREEFROG RULES EVER! Damn, ASIE weren't too bad but these were near bulletproof so maybe the old days of the infamous treefrog rules are finally gone. In short, just damn clear and logical rules and really tight, I had no questions after reading, and none cropped up while playing either other than why were ship cards 6 bucks (and looking at threads many many people had the same question) so not a rules question but a design choice question. So with this its pretty easy to learn imo, only about 10 pages to read and most of that is all the wealth of actions you have available (which I love, options are almost always a good thing). The game is dead simple rules-wise really, and after 1/3 of a game or so, it starts to flow as you learn how and when to do these actions, and right about then you also realize some mistakes you already made too.... 

So the best thing about the game to me is the flexibility you get with the deck building, which really allows you to tailor your approach to the game big time. Its also not like London where the board is just tacked-on, here the board is front row and center to the play. It sort of fits into the twilight struggle category of wargames, as in has a great war theme and wants to be but isn't quite, and its close enough that people will debate it. You don't have any troops you can move around and attack with per se, but in a TS way you can attack neighboring spots with cards from your hand and expand out that way. I think the important thing here to note is that board positioning and approach are almost as important as timing and what cards you are adding to your hand, so it all comes together nicely imo. 

In short, this is what London should have been and it really shows how pedestrian London is in comparison. I'll have more to say I think after another game or two, I can tell you we definitely grew our decks too big too fast in our first game which is often a no-no in a DBG, and what we found was that there were many "non-turns" where there wasn't much you could do because of the cards we were drawing. Some of this I can see can't be avoided but some I am pretty sure can so more play to confirm. For me personally I have noted many times that a pure DBG bores me to tears, but when you make it just one element of a bigger game like here or MageKnight it really shines and lets the creative juices flow.

UPDATE - Just a small update as I can't seem to shake a couple of feelings here as after-thoughts (definitely could be wrong/off on these but they are nagging at me a little). 

1 - I'm thinking the game on the map is going to play out fairly similar each game. I think you are going to have some flexibility in your approach to how you build your deck (but see 2) but since you start with the same locations each game, and those link the same locations, which you then add to deck, and then there are really not that many on the board either so this is how it looks to me for now. I guess if you had more, and more "paths" to expand to the game would end up longer, also this "samey map development" could be tagged on many games too, anyway just an observation 

2 - I wish the game was a little more dynamic (though I don't think this is quite the word I'm looking for). It just seems many turns you have nothing to do, you have 2 cards to settle but missing one, you can't quite start a seige, you can't quite fortify etc, like 40% of the time you get matching cards and the rest of the time you might even discard cards as an action just to try and get other cards. Now this could be us growing our decks too fast, but I'm also thinking this is just a trait of the game you have to accept as well and part of the card draw luck here. Maybe a 6 card hand size would help... Anyway let's see how game 2 goes, as we made a few mistakes in game 1 and are now all the wiser in other areas too.  

UPDATE - Playing the 2nd game and it really struck me just how much of a strategic game this is, it is ALL planning and prioritizing in all aspects of your play. Which cards too add, when and in what order. Which cities to settle, when and in which order. Which cities to fortify, when, order, etc, etc, and etc. This permutates into everything you do which to me is fantastic. Its is also critical here to watch which cards your opponent is adding in order to be prepared to react to potential threats. Another note the asymmetry is done pretty well too. I might have to increase my rating here hammer or not. 

UPDATE 7.5 => 7 Played with a much slimmer deck and while that makes it easier to get things done, there are still a good few 'non-turns' here. Basically more play is not alleviating my 2 concerns I noted above, its a pretty neat game but it just seems to me could have used just a little more development (not pointing to HH here, but obviously that would have been found too) While you have some wiggle room in your deck building, it seems to me each player's overall approach to the game is going to be 'fairly' similar (not exact) each game (more play could prove this somewhat inaccurate) 

=========

Pure deckbuilding barely qualifies as a game to me but makes a good filler, though it mostly leaves me cold. Akin to a pure drafting game without anythng added and thankfully someone finally thought to add an actual game around the deckbuilding, and it looks to be a good one.

Definitely want to play this and do need to play after London which was only lukewarm for me

Edit - Ah well, no big surprise the game has some balance issues, at least its not to me. You start pumping out too many games in a year, means less play-testing for each and something is going to give. WAS going to likely buy this even though I don't like deck building much as the rest of the game sounded interesting, very unlikely now. Let's see how houserules play out....

My son was enthralled by this game when it was being played last night at my local Games Club (Epsom Games Club). So much so that we have had to break out our copy of it and play tonight.

We abandoned the game (?) after 90 minutes of getting nowhere.

I suspect that the rule explanation I recieved from him may have been lacking a certain something, but it is going to be difficult to tell because I have probably played by my first and last game of it. Woeful dirge right up there with Dominion: Alchemy, and not helped by the fiddly little buildings (limited edition equates to limited size!) and what I found to be a difficult board to read.

I think that Martin Wallace has finally convinced me to stop buying anymore of his games with this effort, so not all bad news.

And I get that there are those who will love it, but for me there are just so many better deck building games and MUCH better 2 player games available.

First impression after two games: The card system is gamey and gimmicky as hell, but fun all the same. I can't really stand Dominion anymore, but wrapping its central mechanism in a historical wargame makes for great fun, if not exactly a feeling of much historicity.

The game rides a fine line between wargame and deckbuilding eurogame, without feeling quite like either. It's not going to revolutionize wargaming - it's much too much euro and too little wargame for that - but one still gets quite a lot of historical feel as part of the card play. And seen as a deck-builder, it's just brilliant.

Anyway, I enjoyed my first couple of games immensely and can't wait to try it again. I keep going over potential strategies in my head - a good sign, definitely! :)

Great two player game. Feels like the perfect mix of a deckbuilder and a wargame. It can be a bit of a struggle to teach, but once you get going everything is actually pretty intuitive- of course you need a destination card and a transport symbol to get somewhere. Watch out for the false promise of sieges! They can take forever and cripple both sides!

Initial Rating: 9.0 (February 2012)

What a game. I know it is broken (but I have not read in which way, I want to find out myself) but I´m playing with the 2nd edition rules, I hope the change fixed the issue. I generally like Martin Wallace´s games and this is one of his best. Besides Vladda´s Mage Knight, this deck building game is the only that feels a lot different than the plethora of Dominion clones out there. Unlike other deck building games, right from the beginning you have a lot of strategic decisions about how to construct your deck, I love Dominion but this plays a lot different. 

Maybe this game has the potential to go up in my ratings, for now I´m enjoying tremendously each play. 

A must have for me.

After more than 30 plays, I have cooled a bit towards the game. I still like it but now I don’t want to play it as often as before. Also the infamous Halifax Hammer is still a valid concern.

The replayability factor is hurting A Few Acres of Snow for me, now, almost all the games feel very samey. I think I would feel the same way about Dominion if it didn’t have lots of expansion. I would like to try the scenarios next to see if they add life to the game.

This is a great game, but I feel that it will continue to go down in my personal ratings.

One of 2011`s favorites.

Second Edition Rule Changes:
1. Remove the French bateaux card from the initial deck and place it with the availble cards.

2. Reserve - you cannot place location cards in your reserve.

3. Raids - the raid distance is now two connections plus one connection for each additional card played (so playing two Native American cards would allow you to raid a location up to three connections away).

4. Home Support - you can only take cards from your draw deck, so if you had fewer than three cards available you would only be able to draw these. Consequently, the only time you shuffle your discard pile is when you need to refill your hand at the end of the turn and your draw deck is exhausted.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Incredible game with a relatively straightforward, simplistic design that reveals amazing strategic depth. It also mixes the wargame, economic development, and deck-building genres into a seamless, fast-paced 2-player game that can be finished in about an hour. A perfect storm of awesomeness. I liken it to a BarbaRossa/Agricola hybrid　（BarbaRossa for the army-deckbuilding, and Agricola for the difficult choices to be made with very limited available actions). This game could be destined to be one of my all-time favorites.

EDIT: After failing to find a counter for the British Halifax Hammer strategy, my rating dropped from a 9.5 to a 7. Here's hoping Martin finds a fix for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Four plays in, keeps getting better.

Love the gameplay. Good use of Dominion's deck-building engine in a game, in that (unlike the source) the game comprises of more than just the engine itself.

I'm begining to see some of the options. I really like the way there's always a counter to any apparently strong strategy, and that you need to determine how much effort to put into thwarting your oppoent versus pursuing your own goals.

To avoid falling behind you really can't let your hand clog up with junk, you have to keep the cards turning over and weed out the no-longer-useful from your deck.

Likely to take a fair number of plays to explore all the available options.

I need more plays of this. I don't think I really understand how to build a proper deck. However, the explanation of the actions available in a given hand reflecting the difficulty of supply lines in that war makes good sense. Movement and strategies SEEM a bit limited game-wise, but I feel like I'm only scratching the surface so far. Positive, but reserved, first impression.

RATING: 4

This is the game that, IMHO,  really tarnished Martin Wallace's reputation as a game designer.  Played about half-dozen times, read up on the "killer" British strategy, played against it once as the French and got crushed, then played once as the British and crushed my opponent, then put the game away, never to try it again, even after Wallace went public with his purported "fix."  Read up that even the fix and bidding for seat position wasn't enough to prevent runaway British wins in competitive play at the next year's WBC, so because of this, I have no plans to revisit the game despite some unique applications of the Dominion "deck builder" concept to a two-player wargame.

After having played online many times and in person a couple times, I can say without hesitation that this is the most difficult deck builder. Since you are directly facing against someone, the confrontation is very intense and in your face. This game is not very forgiving. 
I think that it would take about 2 plays to start playing well. You really need to weigh your decisions. 

If that doesn't turn you off from this game then I highly recommend you give it a look. This game is really unlike anything you have ever played before. Every decision feels heavy and you really need to consider your options before you make a decision. The gears behind this game are very tight and decisions can have long lasting effects. 

I absolutely adore this game and am not alone.

A very crafty game which moves at a sharpish pace and packs in more sim value than you might think upon hearing it's a deckbuilder.  Good feel to wilderness warfare versus the sieges and everything that's happened in our games has felt within the realm of history.  I'm impressed.

Wallace didn't succeed in fixing this. Can't rate a broken game higher than this. 
------
Too bad that I made the mistake to browse BGG forums: [thread=703495][/thread]. As usual with deckbuilders, there are annoying / degenerate deck thinning strategies that are well beyond my understanding as a non-MTG player but are necessary to be applied when winning is the only goal. Deckbuilding coupled with asymmetric sides worsens the situation and easily leads to broken games (e.g. Campaign Manager 2008 - just take a look at the best players winning ratios at yucata.de and you know what I mean). Knowing that there are superior strategies for one side that can't be countered diminishes my interest close to zero. Hopefully, Wallace issues a fix that will open up the field of possible winning strategies again. Until then, 4/10.

Deckbuilding+, i.e. there's a purpose to deckbuilding and there's a spatial component to the game which puts this ahead of other deckbuilders. I really enjoyed it on my first play. A firm 7/10 so far.

An interesting game, I like how the deck-building mechanic has been applied to a type of game that usually doesn't feature it. I usually don't like wargames, but I can appreciate how deck-building is almost even thematic here.

I have not really explored the game that much, and have only ever heard of the HH strategy (don't know what it is, haven't applied the fixes to the game), but if I could get more plays in, I could see my rating increasing.

Man, such a bummer. Expected a lot more fun. Next time, playing with someone more experienced. This was just such a slog.

The game is pretty interesting. But a lot of the cool mechanics just weren't fun to play with. Get more areas! That will clog up your deck... Take over territory to create dead cards! Until you yourself get stuck with 2-4 duds in your deck. Don't neglect your military! Until you leave yourself open to raids, thus needing to spam forts and run out of money and only be able to win defensive wars because they have such a better military setup and...

Yeah. Fun game? Not my thing apparently. A pity.

This is a terrific hybrid of a game. Part Wargame, part Deck builder. I am looking forwards to more plays in the near future.

This is a game I expected to love, but I could never get that much into it. I wasn't even bothered by the "broken" HH strategy (though that entire argument on BGG was beyond ridiculous), because I never attempted to play it. There were so many parts of the game that I liked, as well as many interesting choices to make, but it just didn't come together for me. Some of that, no doubt, is due to the theme (which I don't find the least bit interesting). Some of it could be due to the fact that deck-building is by no means my favorite game mechanic. AFAoS is definitely an ambitious attempt to take deck-building and build a serious game around it, and for that it deserves heaps of praise. But overall I'd say that this is a pretty good game that got slammed by a bunch of geeks' overly-inflated expectations. Pity.

I really like this game.  I love the setting, the theme, the mechanics.  I haven't played much, but I already had one epic game that started off with sieges, then went into raids, and finished with a mad race for developments as the game ended.  Not many games can pull that off.

There are complains about the halifax hammer.  Frankly, as far as I am concerned, it is not a major issue.  This guy Tim beats people with the hammer, but he also beats people who try the hammer against him.  Simply put, he has played many many more games than most people, and is experienced.  He should be winning.  The problem is the disparity in experience, not the hammer.

2. Huge amount of wasted space board could have been 1/4 the size.
3. Not a fan of the art direction. It is okay but again the player handouts and rule books could have been more compact.
4. Feels like limited choices, after playing Fading Glory and No Retreat I found the game incredibly bland.

That said would be a fine beer and pretzel game but the board is so HUGE for nothing and the euro bits make this grognard go screaming for a few acres less.

Played once.  Not NEARLY as much fun as I had hoped.  As usual with a 2 player game, this is really just a tug-of-war.  Clearly inspired by the deck-building mechanism.  Note that I do not know, and so could not use, the degenerate "broken" strategies.  Not my kind of game in the long run.

Martin Wallace grade, 2 players war game with a central deck building mechanic a la Dominion.  This is a spectacular game that plays faster than Twilight Struggle and is deeper than Memoire 44.  Being from Quebec, the theme is also interesting but regardless, it's a top notch 2 player experience.  I'd have to play more to ascertain the balance; so far, the English side seem slightly stronger...  Still, what a game.

I had been looking forward to this game a long time because I really liked London and it sounded great.  Unfortunately when I started playing as the British I really felt like I should just rush up and take over Quebec.  I didn't because that felt dumb, but then the game just sort of dragged on, and became so frustrating and boring that we eventually quit playing.  I later learned that the quebec strategy is broken, it's not even a "broken" strategy it just seems to be the way you should play as the British, and seems to be set up for that.  Even if that weren't true, the game is boring with many other problems: with only two actions a turn, boring cards that just don't do much, and your hand getting clogged up with cards you don't want, plus very few things to do really this is unfortunately not a good game, the card that doesn't take an action and draws you three cards is an obvious necessary buy, the raids are way too random and easy.....

RATING: 8
Combines a fabulous blend of tactics (deck-building) with strategy (board campaign).  There are multiple ways to win and you have an economic victory or a war victory. Timing is important and one needs to keep aware of what your opponent is planning for: by watching (1) what cards are acquired for which purposes and by seeing (2) which locations are gained.  The main key to understanding this game is that you have to use many hands (tactics) to take baby steps in implementing your board play (strategy) - and try not to switch strategies back and forth, it only further delays your intermediate goals.  This is another brilliant game by Martin Wallace and it is superb in play and rich in theme.  What a gem!

Uh oh, appears the game is broken?  That would be quite disappointing.  Decided to play anyways and will not look at the methodology involved in the Halifax Hammer.

First play was interesting despite quite a few poor decisions in my deckbuilding efforts early.  One's deck can really get quite large and unwieldy if one is not careful!  Each side has a specific advantage which probably should be specifically pursued.  French probably need to focus on settling early and building forts if possible as well as raiding with the Native Americans.  Raiding is quite interesting and can be quite powerful although forts can really blunt the impact of raiding so the British should likely build forts to protect themselves.  Culling decisions are not always easy.  Concept of this game is fascinating - just wish there wasn't such a dominant strategy for the British that basically breaks the game from all accounts.  Maybe I'll never discover that strategy.

RATING: 8.5
Interesting deck building wargame.  This is the first game I have seen that takes the basic deck building mechanic and does something radically different than Dominion.  The addition of the board and the way in which siege combat is handled is quite groundbreaking.  Ultimately, it could probably offer some more wargame flavor (perhaps greater differentiation of units -- maybe with actual unit designations) to put it over the top and make it a favorite game but it does what it was intended to do quite well and pushes a popular genre in an innovative direction.

RATING: 9
Enjoyed it, without being blown away.

It was nice to explore many of the possible actions.  

Playing by myself was helpful, as this forced me to clarify a few points left unclear in the rules (no raid route from/to Tadoussac), etc.  Sufficient clarifications were found in the FAQ and on BGG.

There are enough strategic possibilities that I felt a little unfocused: should I expand through villages, or develop cities, or raid, or besiege?  Not knowing the point tally also did not help with this: I felt less tension than if I had known that I had to catch up, of that I was not ahead by much.

The rules are streamlined enough that they were not a big problem.

I wish that the player aids that come with the game were more precise (for example, I think that some free actions are not marked as such, or something like that).

Small details show that the game was printed a little too fast: a few (inconsequential) typos in the rulebook, the misprint on the British Fort Venango card, the fact that it's printed as "Venago" on the board…  Not a huge problem, though.

After a first, partial solo play, I don't feel a strong desire to play it again, though.  Not that I don't like the game.  I'm probably not as tempted to play again because this game is relatively static: the decks evolve slowly, pieces don't move/change much,…  I enjoy the idea of playing a more varied game than A Few Acres….  Maybe it's just a matter of mood, however.  The fact is that I feel more like playing older but more dynamic/bloody games like Commands & Color: Ancients, or Memoir'44, or Claustrophobia; or older games like Race for the Galaxy (the hands/card powers vary greatly from turn to turn).

RATING: 8.5
This is one of my all time favorite games and will always hold a special place in my heart.  The game is largely seen as "broken" as there is essentially only one strategy that "works".  However, the deck-building concept coupled with battle and conquest is just fun.  This game is one of the only games we own in which the tension is palpable when playing.  You are just hoping your opponent isn't holding something to block your attempt to kill them once and for all...but they always are!

Has Martin Wallace flown too close to the sun?

I have played this once, before the furore that has surrounded the game; the emergence of a strategy for the which guarantees one side victory.  I was lax in putting up my comments but was inspired by the excellent post of Jesse Dean (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/9073/a-few-acres-of-snow-and-the-critical-silence-on-th) to reconsider the game and my attitudes towards it.

Furthermore, my revisiting the game was done while admiring Bubba Watson's 2012 Master's triumph, who Ed Smith of The Times commented, 'We thrill to triumphs such as Watson's far more than victories founded on the calculated elimination of error.'  Could the same be said about the game?

To draw a line it is empirically evident that the game is not perfect.  It is flawed and that is the responsibility of the designer and the playtesters.  This has been proven over time (a relatively short period of time) and for the game now to suceed at any level you have to treat the flaw like the elephant in the room. 

However, in my single experience of the game I found it to be an exercise in inventiveness, ambition and daring and therefore I would be willing to play again.  Firstly, because the game is ambitious, challenging and enjoyable.  Though I played badly (I always do) I was able to switch strategies , regroup and still had a chance to snap victory from the jaws of defeat.  Secondly, while the game is unsuitable for tournament play I play the majority of my games in a less intense environment with individuals who do not read boardgamegeek or even know what it is and we would not be familiar with the strategy or get any joy from playing a single pre-defined strategy.  Therefore the solved / broken nature of the game is of less importance to me and my group of friends.  Finally, and a small factor is that this game is an important moment in game design (the fusion of the mechanisms).  Though other games will come along and do a better job is undeniable but this was the first to push the boundaries.  Not exactly on the scale of the Wright Brothers but an interesting move forward.

I am of the opinion therefore that the game is solved rather than broken and would happily play again with the proviso that the well publicised solution was not used.

This game is an absolutely brilliant implementation of the card-drafting mechanic to re-imagine the very idea of a wargame. As the notes in the back of the rulebook make clear, the feeling of fiddling away one's time while one waits for the perfect hand to come along is actually a plausible simulation of the bizarre manner in which way that the French and British conducted the Seven years' War from an enormous distance away. 

If you forget about the theme, gameplay can sometimes feel like a bit of a slog, and there are a lot of quirky rules about card use to keep in one's head. But it's a work of singular genius, nonetheless.

Interesting twist on deck-building.  I've only played on Yucata thus far (and it is somewhat difficult to learn there), so I'm not sure I quite have it figured out.  

The strategy for the Brits does seem straight forward enough.  But, the French likewise should be agressive from the start, it seems.

I'd like to play face to face a few times and see if it changes the feel of the game.  I think it is hard for me to 'see' the game as the map play is so driven by the location cards.

The alternate rules do shake things up a bit.  This is classic Martin Wallace in that it is a brilliant design with a fatal flaw.  I only wish that there is a way to bring some balance back with alternate rules.

Highly competitive (Halifax Hammer has been mightily overblown in everyday gaming relevance) title with a thematic feel and a clever deck-tailoring mechanic.  Game does require players to set and more or less stick to a strategy - if players are less focused in their approaches, the game can overstay its welcome.  Initially, rated lower as limitations in actions due to card draws was frustrating; this was due to lack of cohesive strategy.  Great components.

Initially I dismissed this game as being too military a theme to ever engage my wife, but after reading the reviews and comments, I decided to pick it up.  Unfortunately, the conflict in the game was just too much for my better half and she refused to play after our second game.  Fortunately, a friend of mine did like the game so I'm able to play it occasionally as I find it an interesting combination of deck-building, expansion and conflict in spite of it being flawed....

Wow! First time going to a Canucks Amuck meetup and a guy walks in and says he has a trunk full of games he is giving away for free. One of which is this game, which I almost bought from someone not 2 days prior.

I generally don't enjoy pure deck-builders unless there are other aspects to the game in addition. I really love Wallace's A Study in Emerald, both editions, for example. The deck building is central here and I do feel it, so I have something of a hard time wrapping my head around the how to best play. I will likely never be a good player, but I don't mind playing this at all. Most especially because my group would all be pretty equal to me in experience. I expect it would be aggravating to play this with very experienced players.

As far as the game being broken...maybe it is...but it only becomes so once you know how to set up and then exploit the winning strategy. Until then, the play experience is still worthy.

I’ve read a couple of weeks ago that this otherwise highly lauded game carries a fatal flaw in that a certain strategy makes one of the two sides impossibly hard to beat. Playing the game for the first time with that fact in mind (without being able to recollect what, exactly, that strategy is) was a funny experience. Without that information, it would have been a very enjoyable first step into a game that was obviously demanding - it is, for example, hard to create a working game plan without firm knowledge of the various location cards you can gain - but had enough depth and good ideas to reward the time spent to master it. Alas, knowing what I knew, it felt like trying to make a dead bird fly; after all, the game would ultimately not stay true to its promise of being a well-developed asymmetrical war game. Well, the asymmetrical part is true, obviously.

What’s also funny is that for almost every other designer, I would be nowhere near as fast to believe the word of mouth here on the Geek regarding perceived imbalances in a game, but with Wallace’s track record in recent years, the real surprise would have been getting an least at adequately developed game designed by him. This is all the more galling because the design is admittedly brilliant, and I can well understand the many fans of the game who try to find a fix for it. Won’t somebody stop this man from releasing too many games in too little time and make him properly polish one of his efforts for once?

After a few plays I feel that the Halifax Hammer is too great a damage to enjoy the game. Even without knowing much how to play, I just tried to conquer Halifax, then Louisbourg and then Quebec and it worked, without preparing the deck nor any other kind of action designed for the HH.

So I think the game would be too biased to simply try this strategy for any British player, as it's clearly the best strategy.

It's a pity, as the game system is quite nice.

RATING: 4
This is simply a brilliant game. There's absolutely nothing about it that I don't love. I rated it a 9 after one play...then learned about the Halifax Hammer. Now I can't imagine playing it again without trying to work out how HH is done, despite actively avoiding learning how it's done. It's the elephant in the room that will prevent me from ever playing this again; it sucks. I sold the game because of this flaw, and re-rated it to a 4.

Setting that aside, the rulebook is stellar, the bits are nice, the board and graphic design are deliberately understated in a way I find appealing, the artwork is great -- and, most importantly, it's fun and satisfying to play. One play barely scratches the surface, because it's packed so full with options.

Individual turns don't take too long because in general your hand keeps your options limited -- but this is a strategic deck building game, so the hand you have is the hand you built. That adds a ton of depth. The randomness introduced by the card draw adds more, and fits the theme; the balance of strategic/tactical decisions is excellent.

That this amazing package is wrapped around a game that also brilliantly models the history it's trying to model is kind of mind-boggling. Supply lines were long during this period, which is represented by new resources going into your discard pile; settling/conquering a location gives you access to that place's resources, but also makes it harder to manage your empire, which is modeled by increasing the size of your deck.

On top of that, Alysia (non-wargamer) and I (lapsed casual wargamer) made it through our first play in two hours, and I don't think we screwed up any rules -- but it wasn't a light or fluffy experience in any way: It was just right.

There's not an ounce of fat here, and the meat is delicious. Hell, even the box cover is great -- it's stunning, and one of the most intriguing I've ever seen.

after 2 plays, it just feels too long, we ended up wanting to do so many things but never having the cards to do it, probably one third of all actions played in both games were spent discarding cards!! thats just not right.. maybe we dont "get it" but if i need to play the game 10 times to get it, and 3h per time thats just 30h of game time i could have spent on playing games that actually entertain me.. so probably will not play this again any time soon.. I like the idea of it, the rules sounds cool on paper.. but it just did not do it for me.

This is a tough nut to crack. To be sure, it is a decent game. The production quality and components are very good. The deck-building mechanic is clever. Also, it does incorporate theme quite well. BUT...it's a little dry, the siege's are fairly anti-climactic, and it runs about 20-30 minutes too long for what it is. Add in the fact that the game is supposedly broken, it's just not worth it. Returned.

RATING: 8
Overwhelming at first due to the range of actions that players choose from. Once you get the hang of it, the game is excellent. A lot of strategy involved but the mechanics of the game are very straightforward once you realize that only a few actions are relevant at any given time. It's a war game, but it's really a strategy game with a war theme. The historical background lends a fresh dose of realism to the gameplay. Highly recommended.

A Few Acres of Snow is an asymmetrical, two-player, deck building, war/civilization board game that simulates the Seven Years' War in North America.  That was a mouthful!  In it players take on the role of either the English or the French, each having their own starting colonies.  Each player has their own starting deck of cards, and in typical deck building fashion they can use these cards to get more powerful cards as the game plays on.  These cards are then used to take actions on the game board, which depicts a map of the eastern third of North America.  There are lots of actions that can be taken on a player's turn.  Some of the more common ones are: get money, develop a new settlement, increase a settlement from a village to a town, fortify a town, and lay siege to an enemy settlement.  There are a few different win conditions.  The most war-like is take Quebec if you are the English, or take either Boston, or New York if you are the French.  The more civ-building win condition is to put either all your villages, or all your towns out on the board before the other guy.

I really enjoy A Few Acres of Snow.  I like the historical aspect of the game.  I like that there are many options that can be taken on your turn.  Players can use different strategies to go after a win.  You can be as war oriented as you like, or just try to expand your influence peacefully.  If you like history, or strategy, or deck building, or good games...then I highly recommend you give this one a try.

Halifax hammer be damned. A Few Acres of Snow is a light wargame with Dominion-inspired gameplay and, at that, it works very well. AFAoS allows for aggressive and defensive strategies through multiple potential victory conditions. For my part, I've found winning any sieges to be excessively difficult and a considerable investment of effort. The game seems, primarily, won on settling and raiding.

That being said, it balances quite well. It has bit of a learning curve but, once acclimated, will play fairly smoothly.

Not a wargame at its heart, more of an abstract game about colonization.  So don't play if you care about understanding the history in any depth.  Beyond that, it is certainly challenging, plays quickly and evokes a lot of tension.  Good fun.

This is not a casual game.  As Martin Wallace notes in the rule book ,the first few plays will be overwhelming and take a long time.  In our first game we called it quits after 3 hours.

Somewhat finicky rules, fixed starting positions and decks means dominant strategies, and while playing we burned a lot of turns just to cycle through our decks to get to the cards we wanted.  Would likely get better with more plays, but we gave it 2 tries and aren't motivated to press on.

Martin Wallace polarises me. Some of his games I love (Wensleydale, Automobile, London, Liberte), others I really don't care for. This is, I'm afraid, one of the latter. A deck-building CDG (sort of), you have a hand of cards which can be played as one of your two actions a turn. Replenishment also costs an action. An action may consist of more than one card played - for example, play a town card to indicate that you're moving a force to a town, play another to represent the method of travel, plus another, if required, to represent frontierspeople/settlers. 

There's been a lot of this kind of thing lately and, though it's not a bad game, it's not my kind of game. I find the two actions per turn too limiting. Sorry, Martin, but I pass on this one. (And the Discworld one too as I think Discworld is lame.)

Ordered via subscription.

After 1 play I give it a 7.5.  Will either be 7 or 8.  Should go up with more plays. 

Intriguing game.  I like it better than your average deck building game already.  Found it frustrating in my first play trying to setup the combos, but I think that is my fault for poor play, not the game's fault.

The asymmetric setup for the 2 sides is intriguing.  The strategies for each side seem quite different.  Yet, it appears fairly balanced in that either side can win. 

I think I'd like the cubes and disks better than the upgraded limited edition components.

French vs the British for the conquest of Canada otherwise known as the French Indian War that culminated in the fall of Quebec in 1759. A gateway wargame with a novel deck building mechanic.  This game is a little gem.  Fast for a wargame and extremely playable and even spouse friendly yet with layers of strategy that are only apparent after several plays.  Love it!  Rated:  9

UPDATE:  After two weeks I and several others have discovered a strategy that breaks the agme.  I've quit playing it and am downgrading it unless Martin responds as promised with some kind of fix. Rated: 5 (Oct 28/2011)

UPDATE;  Martin has posted a simple and elegant fix and I'm re-instating my original rating. Rated:  9 Jan 1/2012.

UPDATE:  Downgraded to 7.  The fix isn't really a fix.  The game has major balance issues.  It's a pity because it's a fine design otherwise, but I'm afraid it's going in the trade pile.  My first and possibly last Martin Wallace game.

UPDATE:  Downgrades to 5.  Traded for Cyclades.  Just lost interest trying to make this turkey work.

Decent game. I still need to play more to determine how much control I have. I don't like how you start the game with a large portion of your victory points already in hand. It makes the game feel less epic to go from 23VP to 40VP during a game. I'd like the game to be more tactical, but there are many turns you can't do what you want because you don't have the cards, so you just punt, and wait until the next turn. That's a problem with many deck-builders, though, so I won't fault this game for that. My favorite thing about the game is chaining together cards to move; you need a destination card, a transportation card, and sometimes a settler card and/or a boat. It makes it exciting when you can pull that move off. And then you have to factor in the usefulness of using a card with military strength when you want to save it for expansion, and you have decent tension there. Overall, I like this game, especially when it plays in 60 minutes or less.

Have been looking for a meaty 2-player for quite some time now. Thought AFAoS sounded interesting despite not beeing a Wallace fan at all.

After one game I had mixed feelings. It had been overly long and strategy-wise it was very unclear.

Now after six games I am just blown away. It has so much to offer in terms of strategy and replayability.
And we have just scratched the surface.

true twist on deck building and decent thinking outside the box by mr. wallace here.

pretty long, but interesting decisions here and there.  although, at the longer end of game play length, maybe wilderness war captures the feel better.

What other game have I played 26 times before rating? It would be impossible to rate A Few Acres of Snow after just one or two, but over the 26 I feel I've gone through various phases, from lack of understanding, to fake mastery, to learned ignorance, and I'm not sure where I've ended up. It's a fascinating game, really, combining aspects of tight deckbuilding, the location-and-other card system of Brass, and a 2p wargame. Definitely worth playing, and more than once or twice, but I've reached the point that it's no fun to play against my betters.

There is a minor rules tweak by Wallace in the rules forum that addresses a balance issue.

This game TOTALLY ROCKS.

Hands down, the best two player game I have ever played. Experienced players can finish in about an hour. 

It's deep, yet not overly complex, and, like most Wallace games, the theme is so seamlessly integrated with the mechanics, you get the feeling that the most effective way to win is to transport yourself to the time and place.

I hope it inspires other designers to take deck building in new directions. Dominion, Thunderstone, etc. are now dead to me. Okay, not dead, I still like them a lot, but they're appetizers. This game is the meal. 

Like the scene in Ratatouille when the critic eats the dish that changes the way he thinks about food - this game raises the bar for deck building and two player games in general.

Update after many online games on Yukata. Still my favorite 2 player game. Just keeps getting better. Perfect blend of strategy and tactics. Still by far the best use of the "deck building" mechanic.

The only way to make this game better is to give me an iPad version.

Update after even more plays. This is still my favorite game. So much better than the fussy, overwrought, overly-long, Twilight Struggle in the deeper 2 player game category. As far as I'm concerned, there is AFAOS, and then everything else.


Regarding the Halifax Hammer - I don't know anybody who actually plays the game that considers it a problem. As of now, I've played 145 times on Yucata; it's a completely overblown non-issue and a friggin' shame that one of the best games of all time was maligned from the start by a bunch of naysayers who never even played, otherwise they'd realize that the only time you would ever go through the rote, scripted, exploit is to prove it's broken. 

Again... other than to prove that the exploit exists, there is no reason to ever do it. The other player would know immediately what you were trying to do, and what you'd be trying to do is prove a point - the point being, you're a jerk who just wasted a half hour instead of playing a game. Also, after the first two turns, if you don't pursue it step by step, precisely and by rote, it won't work. 

The one time I executed a Halifax Hammer, I literally sat there with the script of how to do it that I'd printed out, paying careful attention to each move - it was not unlike the time I time I had heard that if you play Dark Side Of The Moon to coincide with the beginning of The Wizard Of Oz it matches up; kind of a weird novelty I had to try myself to see if it actually worked... definitely not something I'd ever feel compelled to do more than once. So here's how to "fix" the problem - don't do it!

RATING: 8
I'm not a big fan of Dominion et al but this game uses the deck-building mechanic in an interesting and unique way. Capture of locations plus payment for cards allows you to build your deck. The inherent time delay in putting the card into the deck and actually drawing the card nicely simulates the difficulties of conducting a campaign with such long supply lines. There would appear to be multiple routes the victory and the key would seem to establish a strategy and build a deck accordingly (do you choose all-out aggression or settlement or a combination of the two) If your deck becomes too big you can get bogged down by not being able to draw the right card combos, too small and you have too few options. This is an intriguing came with lots to explore. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
After 2 plays it looks like it will have loads of replayability. I've been thinking about the game hours after playing it, which is always a good sign. 

I've gone out of my way to avoid learning the Halifax Hammer, so the game is still functional for me. The game can turn into a long slog if you don't manage your deck properly; that's how the last play went, and that sour experience has dulled my enthusiasm for it a bit.

Interesting. I've tried to play this on Yucata, with little success, but now that I played this with an actual, physical copy, it was much easier to understand. I like creative use of deck-building, and this one has plenty of that. I also like the way the cards are not automatically recycled, and you need to do a lot of effort to get the crap cards out of your hand.

Suggest.

After three games aborted by boredom, I've finally finished a couple. The conceit of the design keeps drawing me in, even though I don't find playing to be all that enjoyable. It's like playing Dominion repeatedly with the same set of Kingdom cards: eventually, you're going to find a preferred configuration and stick with it. Maybe I'll try some of the scenarios on yucata.de, at which point I'd be obliged to raise my rating. The game does keep sucking me back in...

A great direct conflict card drafting game. This is how card drafting should be used, as a part of a whole. I think I would rate it higher if it weren't a 2player game. I've just over the years have come to think the meatier the game, the more players it needs. I ONLY play 2 player games with my wife, and this wouldn't be one of them. It's a personal thing. Also, I am wondering about the balance of the game and if the British has an equal chance at victory. I don't mind asymmetric games, but I'd like to hear more strategies that enable the Brits to win first.

"Deck-building? I know deck-building; this should be easy to pick up" Wow! A heavy, heavy deck-building game. I think my first game went 5 hours and we even finished in (the apparently less usual) capture of Quebec. It was a bit exhausting, but looking back it was very rewarding. Loved the asymmetry between the British and the French. And the deck-building really did seem to capture the logistical challenges of the war.

Very fun and strategic deck building military game about the war between the French and the British on the East Coast.

Only two players, the amount of actions you can do during your turn can be overwhelming at first so there's a high learning curve.

Forget what people say, it's not broken at all, unless you push it to its limits (and I yet have to find them). Rather it's a wonderful deckbuilding wargame with some twists. Its slow [i]slow[/i] pace is in line with the hystorical setting: this gives you the idea of that war (even with nice historically accurate results), but the playtime is rather long. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

It is what Dominion should be, if Dominion could pee standing up.

EDIT, 22MAR2012: changed rating from 9 to 6 after new rules came out, as I have not played it since. The constant bickering about the rules and the HH in the BGG forums ruined the game for me. I have since unsubscribed to this games forums, and I could care less what people think about the game, and I could care less if I ever play it again.

Deck building meets a board game, where one side is loaded with resources, while the other needs to figure out how to work with what they have. This is a lovely strategic game of chess in the new world, where hand management is key.

Like After the Flood, faintly disappointing. It has all the hallmarks of a Wallace game: innovative ideas, tons of theme, interesting mechanics. But the Dominion-reshuffle idea makes the game take far too long and breeds frustration. Call me crazy, but I don't find it fun to churn and churn for cards that allow me to do what I could do in five minutes in a wargame. If Wallace was going to hijack this idea (I'm glad he did, I loathe Dominion), he needed to improve the boring, staid parts of it. Why play this or Dominion when you've got Ascension and/or Quebec 1759?

This is a game I have wanted to play since first seeing it as a prototype at SorCon some years back.
After one play using the second edition rules, I think that this game has potential to be really good with future plays. You need to know the cards in detail in order to play the game to the best advantage, so any early game(s) will suffer.
Looking forward to my next game.

Very interesting game.  When a game can take a subject you could care less about into a thematic experience, you know it is a good game.  I like it a LOT!  I'm not quite sure why, but I do.  It probably has to do with the greater card control this game affords you over other deck builders along with the interaction of the physical map.  Very cool!

Only downside I've seen thus far is that the first several games have taken 3 hours to complete.  Must be us.  Regardless, glad I picked this game up.

I bought this second hand at a convention.  It was a good decision.  The game is a nice variation on the F+I war.  I'm not a huge fan of CDG but this one appeals for some reason.  Perhaps it's because my games seem to ebb and flow between the two sides until one side slowly builds momentum that can't be stopped.

I wasn't sure what to expect with A Few Acres of Snow, but I came away pleasantly surprised. It is definitely a war game with a deck-building engine at its core. It can be a little daunting at first, because there are literally like 15 different things you can do on your turn with your two actions, and between that and the huge pool of cards you can add to your deck, it's a lot to take in. It's very likely that my rating will rise as I play this more, but I'm not sure I have the time to devote to something with such deep strategy.

UPDATE: Yeah, I just don't have the time to sink my teeth into this one. It's a good game, even if the designer has admitted to it being broken. I'm not sure I like Wallace's take on deck building, as a mechanism, anyway. It felt like his deck building games got progressively worse following this one.

I first got this back in 2012, loved it, and almost immediately plunged into the community effort to "fix" it.
Though I no longer own a physical copy, I continue to play online, and have probably played about 100 games, and continue to enjoy it and regard it as one one of my favorites.

Many people consider the game "broken" but I think it is more accurate to say "solved." And it is really only solved at the very highest standard of play. My judgment of the game has matured over time, and the problem of a dominant strategy seems less of an issue to me than it once did.

Enjoy the game. It's a lot of fun. If you ever get to the point where you feel you can no longer lose playing British you can start introducing variant rules (especially No Governor on starting locations, which I believe comes very close to "fixing" the problem).

Don't miss out on a great game on account of the fact that there are players out there who can always win. 

All that said, if they ever come out with a 3rd edition, that has some kind of variable set up, or officially incorporates elements of the Random Rules Generator, I would absolutely buy it.

   This is quite different from other Martin Wallace games i have played. I was worried whether Martin can design a war game well before  I play this game.But finally Mr Wallace surprise me a again.You can hardly figure out how can DBG and wargame combined so good, but Martin make it!

    For sure, this is not a "real-wargame(you know what I mean)",but for most non-wargamers,A Few Acres of Snow givs them an impression about what war is like --- you need to prepare well to win a siege, or sometimes you want to support a town besieged but you are too late,etc.

    The game play is also addicting,fast pace,high tense You have dozens of thing to do but you can only do two.This is a game i'll play it several time is a single day, very few games can make me do that.

    The only thing that does not satisfy me is that, comparing with other games like brass or AoS, A Few Acres of Snow is not deep enough ---- but still plenty of strategy, so it still has high replaybility.  

PS:The game weight should be 3.4 or heavier, maybe the clear written rules make people think it is simpler than it should be .

RATING: 8.5
This game simulates the 18th century battles between Britain and France for control of what is now North America. In this card driven game, the mechanics are borrowed from Dominion, but it does it to realistically simulate how wars were fought then. If you need resources, you need to make a request for them, and here they show up in your discard pile before being part of your draw deck. 

You can settle locations with a village, or upgrade them to double your VPs. You also score points by capturing cubes of your opponents through seiges or raids. 
The game can also end if either side captures a key town. 

This is a very good game, and I am looking forward to more plays. There are many strategies to pursue, and many things to do! Too bad it only plays with 2 players.

A VERY different deck building game. This isn't for those casual gamers that love Dominion or Ascension. This reminds me more of a game for the fans of Twilight Struggle or 1960. The deck building is fun, the war is fun, and the play of the game is fun. It took a bit longer than I expected going into the game, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Starts as a 7 rating for me, but with more plays I could see this going up.

As with Android: Netrunner, I want to [-]capitulate[/-] rage quit as soon as I'm attacked. I don't see why anyone likes this game. Perhaps direct combat lies in my gaming blind spot / is a trigger, and that's why I had such bad reactions to Android: Netrunner, A Few Acres of Snow, A Game of Thrones Board Game, and Eclipse. It's not the games, it's me.

Excellent first impression. 3 games so far but need more plays!
EDIT: more plays and just hit my sweet spot: a really thematic and complex "dominion", each card having a significance in the game play.
EDIT2: I'm trying for now a small variant: add the bateau initially to the English deck (and limitation of home support):
1) to slow down thin deck: Halifax > Louisbourg
2) to accelerate alternative way to do pression on French (rush on the middle and Great lakes path)
Seems enough for me (I'm not fond of double range raid, no laction in reserve or remove French bateau from his initial deck)

I have really been digging A Few Acres of Snow; I think it's a very innovative system. I have been introducing it as "Dominion, where estates are actually useful". Pretty much all of my games except my first have been games where I was teaching it to someone new, so the actual games have been a foregone conclusion, and more of a demo game than the man to man intellectual combat I crave.

The current dominant strategies for both sides have all revolved around deck thinning, followed by building up a large bank, splurging on military and going to war. I expect that taking any of the game-ending locations would be extremely difficult against experienced opponents. 

This game reminds of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization in that military is not required... unless your opponent goes military. In a game where both players go the military route, it will be interesting to see who has the advantage.

---

The core of the game is pretty simple. It's a deck-building wargame. But that description belies the intricate dance of delicious strategic possibilities that rarely seems possible in anything other than an RTS computer game against a competent and human opponent. Because of the deck-building nature of the game, even the seemingly simplest decisions have long-term strategic consequences that you will rue for turns afterward, with only the occasional raid/ambush tactical decision giving you some relief.

It's still in discovery mode, meaning I can't be sure at any given point what the best move is for either side -- is rock better than paper or scissors?* Unfortunately, my most reliably likely opponent is not quite as passionate about the game as I am, and I may never have the opportunity to completely spelunk the wondrous depths I remain convinced this game opens up to its devotees.

---

Okay. Rating heavily downgraded. The game as published has serious balance issues: British can easily force a win. We can balance the game with some heavy rules modifications, but this exposes an even worse core gameplay weakness: The optimal strategy in the game is essentially fixed. Unless we also houserule some variability to the empire decks or the starting locations, the optimal path just plays itself out, with only minor decisions required. (Imagine Dominion with only a single set of 10 kingdom cards.)

Dominion is like Lake Pontchartrain: Very shallow. You can figure out a given set after 1-2 plays, but there is so much of it, that you could swim around it forever without seeing same thing twice.

Chess and Go are Lake Baikal: Extremely deep. You can see across it, but you can never swim to the bottom.

AFAoS is like my community pool.

A true hybrid game that combines wargame-like forward planning and supply chain management with eurogame-like card manipulation, deck-building style.

I have played several times and so far consider this to be one of the finest efforts of 2011. It's also far and away my favourite Martin Wallace game since Automobile.

If this is what deck-building can result in, then I'm happy Dominion was invented, because it allowed games like these to come about. No, this isn't Dominion - if you want a 20 minute exercise in figuring out the 'right' card combination first, go away. But if you want an engaging struggle that finely meshes tactics and strategy and provides multiple potential paths to victory, then do yourself a favour and get this game.

A really nice deck building twist with lots of strategic decisions to make on how you build your deck - settler heavy to build cities for VPs, troop heavy to inflict sieges to steal cities, raider heavy to steal VPs, deck manipulation cards, defence cards, and so on. As your deck grows, you get good turns and poor turns, simulating the ebb and flow of the conflict. It doesn't feel like a war game, more of expansion and competition for restricted spaces, with multiple ways to choose to do it. Lots to explore. I like it.

Hopefully this technique of incorporating a board into a deck-building-driver game catches on with other designers.  Great to see the extra substance added to what is otherwise just a card game (that is when compared to most deck-building games).  Love it!

I'm not good at war games, or miniatures. I enjoy this.

This is a 2-player deck-builder boardgame which works brilliantly with the French and Indian War theme. The sides are asymmetrical. Slight learning curve, but the intuition kicks in, and the plays get faster.

Bravo, Martin Wallace.

The idea of a deck-building game combined with a war game is new and fresh. As with most any deck-building game you need to get the cards to do certain things, but there are enough options with how you build your deck that a player should be able to always do something on their turn. I think the concept could be used for any era war game which is good but at the same time that's maybe where the game lacked for me. I didn't really get much flavor of the time period with this one. Maybe it is the wood pieces (cubes and discs), as the only visual players get is from the cards themselves.

You build a deck and then use it to perform actions. You can buy cards into your deck, but also obtain city cards by exploring or conquering regions on the board. The game is a mix of card drafting and a battle for location on the board. When besieging your opponent, you must continue the battle from round to round until one player holds the lead for a full turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the concept of this game and like the deck-building, especially how unforgiving it is. You have to be very selective about what sort of strategy you take as having a deck with too many cards can leave with totally useless cards (discarding costs money and a precious action!). I really enjoy the location mechanic that makes you play one location card to get to another, then also have to play the type of transportation to get there, inspired! 

The only issue I have with the game is that due to the way the map is drawn it’s hard to know which locations you need to get to other ones, especially the locations that are connected via ship.

If you’re looking into getting this but you’re worried about the Halifax Hammer, as long as you don’t look into the specifics of that strategy then you’ll be fine. I’ve played this a few times with people who know of the strategy’s existence, but we couldn’t figure it out, so I don’t think it is the most obvious and that allows you to play the game without it being broken.

Was pretty interesting. I liked how the deck building aspect was incorporated into a bigger wargame. I liked the different paths you had to consider when getting between locations. 
I really disliked the raiding ability because every time I tried to expand, my opponent sniped the place from me. I stocked up on fortifications and indian cards, but it wasn't enough to always protect myself until I could fortify a location. And then my deck was flooded with cards that I didn't need a lot of the other times.
It lasted a but longer than I would have liked, but it was still fun. If I am going to play a 2 player board game, though, I think I would prefer a pure deck builder if I want a deck builder, or maybe Twilight Struggle

Broken- Halifax Hammer. I don't understand why people give high ranks to unplayable games with lame gameplay. Looks like M. Wallace is taking the EA games business plan to boardgaming. Does not seem concerned to fix it either.
After a couple of games, it becomes clear that the best French and English strategies are very limited. There is nothing to do in this game other than randomly expand, attempt indian raids and build infantry.... nothing. Utterly bilinear game with predictable unfolding.The fact that this game won so many awards clearly shows that some awards are not certificates of quality.

Great use of the deck building mechanic, this game is about learning to use different optimization strategies and figuring out what allows you to make a good push on the right direction.

Very interesting war/deckbuilding hybrid, with a heavy economic development aspect too.

This game has a lot of rules and options (probably not compared to other wargames, but it surprised me); there are many ways in which you can combine the cards in your hand, and then there are a lot of different cards to buy.

Like Brass, I felt that in AFAoS cards limit more what you can do then give you options. There's 20+ things you can do, but only if you have a card with a specific symbol on it. I really dislike that in games. As the game goes on, you can buy more cards that let you do cool stuff, but it still feels somewhat 'off'.

I love the idea, and think the design is great, but ultimately, I don't think it's a game for me. The many ways to win, the lack of direction the game gives you, the overwhelming number of options when you first start playing, being at the mercy of the cards and the balance issues mean I can't really see myself enjoying this with my friends.

There really is a lot to explore here, which is great, but that sadly doesn't fit my gaming habits, and AFAoS doesn't seem like a game for the occasional 2-player wargamer to me.

The general idea is one player is the British and starts with lots of money and ports. One player is the french and starts with some military strength and access to a lot of locations that produce pelts that can be sold for tons of money. Each player deckbuilds in different ways to progress their goals, but also in response to each other. Like a good historical combat game, this game really made me imagine what it was like during this period.

Playing this on Yucata right NOW :)!! Normally, I would be opposed to logging my Yucata plays but this is where I'm really cutting my teeth and figuring out some strategy. Logging plays helps me remember my thought process. Anyway, my first two plays were tough and felt a lot like a blank canvas for someone who has not played a war game, or even a light war game. My third game, I thought i knew what i was doing but got my ass handed to me. Now I am beginning to see how it all comes together and I'm having a blast. There is quite a bit of tension and I finally got a win but I definitely had to work for it. I suppose that says more about my opponent than me though. I love how players have to make tough choices because you simply cannot do everything you like when you like. Everything takes time to build but, spend too much time building and your opponent is chocking up VP. Not worried about the "broken" charges. I don't want to know that strategy and I doubt it'll come up at all for me. Looking forward to digging in deeper. 

EDIT:  haha! Well, HH has come up but even implementing it, I still lose. I don't know the entire HH strategy though and who am I compared to Out4blood? This honey badger CAN'T give a %*!/$@ because it doesn't always know what it's doing! Hahaha!!

The options are simply bewildering at first, as it's a deck-building game where you can choose any card from a large range of options. How you choose to play the cards that you draw is also wide open as most cards can be used in several different ways. Typically for Wallace, it has a meticulously researched theme with well matched mechanics. There are a number of different strategic approaches for each side; the question will be whether they become scripted with repeat play or whether the randomness of drawing from the deck provides enough tactical variation to maintain replayability.

It's a shame that this game became the lynchpin of an ideological war, as it never set out to be a representative of such theoretical discussion and critique. If you don't know what I'm referring to, search "Halifax Hammer" for a far better explanation than I can provide.

Having followed the above-mentioned tempest in a teapot with detached curiosity, I was intrigued at the chance to actually play the game in question. With no knowledge of the intricacies of Nova Scotian bluntness, I sat to play as the French against my friend, who owned the game and played as the Brits. He apparently had never heard about the hammer either, so we played an old-fashioned slugfest that probably looked a lot like the way the designer envisioned.

And it was great.

Yeah, the rules were kinda tough to remember and complex in certain areas, but as a somewhat abstract wargame, there is really no way to avoid it. This game was made for players who crave that type of complexity, and it delivers (even though it's not my favorite type of game, it fulfills its intended purpose so I can't complain). The game had tons of crunch, and there were meaningful decisions to be made every turn. It flavorfully simulates the bureaucracy of fighting a war, and there are plenty of interesting ways to manage your resources. If you want to play this to have an experience and not to rise to top-level greatness, it's fine. If you want to talk about the problems at the highest level, go ahead, but for 90+% of all players, that won't ever matter. Accept it for what it is, and it's a beautiful game.

And now, a word about the designer: There was a certain recorded instance in which he responded very poorly to criticism and took potshots at some of his fans. Since then, he seems to have mellowed out and accepted criticism more gracefully. You shouldn't let that affect your perception/enjoyment of the game. You might not like him (I'm certainly not his biggest fan after what he said), but don't let that cloud your image of his work. It stands on his own.

Update: Since I've started rating the designers in some of these, I'll give Martin Wallace a 5/10 for refusing to admit he made a minor error and instead whining incessantly before mellowing out a bit. Doesn't affect my rating of the game though.

Disclaimer: I do not like deck building games nor do I like Wallace's designs. I played half a game with someone who has similar tastes as I do.

I do like the theme, though.

We found this game exceedingly slow and lacking in any tension. Later in the game, we figured out what we should have done in order to manage our decks better. Instead, we decided to abandon the game for something more interesting.

It could be argued that I should try this again; the game should play much faster. However, I don't have any interest in doing so. This is a deck building game with a pasted-on theme. I do not feel like I am fighting a war between the French and the British. I feel like I am managing a deck. For example, movement of units to settle or attack is over-abstracted to waiting for a very specific card combination. When I play a war game, I want at least the geography of the map and the manoeuvring of units to have a significant role in the game. In this game, it's all about managing a deck of cards, to which many of the strategy guides here attest.

After several plays I can say this game is amazing. I love how Martin Wallace handled the deckbuilding mechanism - here it has been very thoughtfully incorporated, both in mechanical and thematical sence. It's not an easy game to play, very punishing if you mismanage your deck, but that's where the beauty comes. 

At first it may seem that the game doesn't offer much replay value, because the most obvious strategies are relatively simple, but the variability comes from the interaction between players. You really need to execute your plan well and react fast on your opponent's moves! Sadly, I won't play it as often as I would like, but up till now every game has been tense and satisfying.

Deceptively simple, yet, deep down, really intricate. Loving it!

It is hard to say what I think of this game after 1 play.  I like the idea of a deck building game revolving around a theme and map, but it is hard to say that I would rather play this than Dominion.  First of all, Dominion has the great advantage that the rules of play change each time a new set of cards reaches the table.  Acres, on the other hand, will have the same constraints game after game.  I think that the long term replayability is quite limited as players will find the one or two only possible ways of winning. Ultimately, I think this is a game I can pass on.

The game is horrible as one can't tell from the map how to reach certain points (= you have to have additional maps for that). Also there is no way to feint your opponent to somewhere, since armies are in limbo where they can be deployed anywhere. Then there is only one way to go (if Brits want to go to Quebec). Brits also start with very good cards in the deck, which is bad for deck builder. It seems the design team had not grasped basic deck building concepts. And of course the game as published is tic-tac-toe broken.

DECK BUILDING MARRIED TO MAP FOR FRENCH AND INDIAN WARS
One solo play to hash out rules and play flow and one learning play with my 15 YO son.  Young Blucher won playing the French.  Innovative and entertaining blend of mechanics fused to interesting historical theme.  And all those HH whingers just need to move along.  Looking forward to more plays.

Seeing balanced games now: 54/53 last game. Don't listen to the excitable ultra-competitive types, this game has legs.

=====================================================

Nifty marriage of deck management and territorial expansion game. And unlike most of Wallace's euro/conflict hybrids, A Few Acres seems robust and resilient.

Presents tough choices of several strategic options (expansion, raiding, sieging, development), and rewards specialization enough that you need to have a plan, but not so much that it's impossible to adjust. My only concern is that all of our games so far have been lopsided. I can discern how we will change tack to counter one another as we become more experienced, but I haven't seen a tight, back-and-forth sort of game at the table so far.

A Few Acres of Snow is something of a breakthrough in wargames, along the lines of We the People. However, my guess is (like WtP) it will be superceded by more sophisticated and polished iterations of the system.

2.19.12 An interesting game between the French and British in America. This game took me a bit to get my head around as it is not a straight war game. On it's face it looks like one, but in my game, there was only ever one big siege. 
The goal is to build you hand and get the cards you need to do the things you want.
Also, you have money management and settlers you need to take important area in to the mix.
While I did enjoy the game, im not sure this is must own for me. 
While there is lots to do, it really did seem more of deck building game more than anything.

I almost peed when Martin Wallace gave me a free copy of this at Essen 2011, after I gave him a copy of JAB to thank him for allowing me to do the game designer promo.  Felt like 2 soccer players trading jerseys.  Except he's Christiano Ronaldo, and I'm some nobody brought up from the minors.

Update:  Just played my 8th game, and still peeling back the many layers of this giant onion.  If I could give this game an 11, I would. Martin Wallace is my hero.

9th Play: One of the most intense gaming experiences I've ever had.  I was holding off the British quite well along the coast with many many fortifications, but had to sacrifice interior defenses to do so.  I was winning in points until I failed to fend off a final siege on Fort Frontenac.  This game plays like it took 100 years to develop.

After 40 games or so, many of which were losing to the HH against out4blood, my rating of 10 remains.  It takes an amazing game to get me to play it 40 times these days, and this one still has my attention.  I hope Martin fixes the game, as it is probably my favorite game of all time (second of course, to Brass).  I feel it is of paramount importance to Martin Wallace to fix this game (properly), as it clearly represents a potential masterpiece that will stand for years and years and years to come as one of the best war games ever created.

Current hypotheses on fixing the game:
Player decks should almost never drop below 11-12 cards in order for this game to function as it is intended to.  Sadly, the last rule change of "don't allow reserving location cards", while at first glance sounds like a good solution to increase British deck size, has an adverse effect (damaging the French more than the British).  This is because the French can no longer reserve locations that are under siege, resulting in them having to a) discard besieged location cards b) governor them away, which sucks if they actually win the siege, or c) let them rot in their hand reducing their hand size by 1, which is horrifying.  Not being able to reserve locations also makes fortifying, governoring and developing locations (2 primary focuses of the French), more difficult and random.  

The change to home support is genius, and actually makes card flow MUCH more important and strategic.  Also, because of home support's cost early game, it is no longer an auto buy (a good thing).

The fundamental problem with the British is that their starting cards are far too multi use.  With merely 3 of the british starting cards, you can develop locations, trader for 6, reenforce a seige, access key points on the map, and settle a location after winning a siege.  You can do EVERYTHING.  This means you require little to no cooldown between winning a siege and beginning the next one, and your money engine represents the same set of cards as all the cards required to settle.  Because of the size of your deck, you also only need to wait 1-2 turns between purchasing and reenforcing a siege, VS the french who have to wait 2-4 turns between buying and reenforcing (especially when they are defending in a siege)

I like this game.  I hear that it's too easy for the British to win, but as often as we play it, we haven't beomce that familiar with the strategy.  The French have won the majority in our group.  They raid much more easily and so the British have to spend some time trying to prevent it.  Then, they can work on the Halifax Hammer.  Really, a creative and elegant design.  If we find with repeated plays that one side has a major advantage, we'll simply make a small adjustment.

06-03-2015.Rated after 1 play. Frontrunner for Mythotopia, this game plays 2 and is thematic. Mythotopia uses a generic theme to accomodate the 4p.

Both games share many mechanisms. They are deckbuilders in which you draw 5 cards and use your cards to build fortifications, attack cities and settle locations.

Both games treat war in the same way, you buy troop cards which you use a tug-of-war like mechanism to see who wins. at the start of each turn players can end combat, but only if you are winning. 

I like the game a lot.

I'm hesitant to rate this yet with only a couple plays under my belt, because I see a staggering amount of strategic depth I have not yet begun to delve into. Even though the deck building is an integral part of gameplay, I think A Few Acres of Snow lands firmly in the light war game genre. Rule explanation can be lengthy at 45-60 min, and I think that alone may scare off the casual Dominion crowd.

The artwork is great, albeit confusing when it comes to figuring out where you can raid from, but everything else seems well-balanced and functional. apart from a slight learning curve due to the mechanics of the cards, I could see this being a great introduction into light wargaming, along with the likes of Memoir 44 and Battle Cry.

I am thoroughly impressed by this deck-building war game hybrid by Martin Wallace.

At first, I thought the deckbuilding mechanism would just be an interesting system added onto the side of an area control game, but little did I know how thematic it would be. 

You never quite have all the resources you need and you have to wait for your deck to cycle to get the cards you just purchased, which neatly emulates how long it took get resources during the French-Indian war. It's an unforgiving and tense game.

A deck-building wargame between England and France for the control over Canada. The idea is great. I always love to see some quick-flowing wargame. However, as the notorious Halifax Hammer comes into being, the game starts to break. The almighty M.W. had no choice but to put forth new rules to diminish the bug effect, which deteriorates the game greatly. The modified version is still fun.

AFAoS shows the way that deckbuilding games need to go (for me at least): positional play with a board that creates direct confrontation between two opponents.

Unfortunately, in this case the concept is poorly executed: as the designer himself admits, this game is flawed. 

At first, AFAoS seems to have a dizzying, overwhelming variety of options and its level of innovation seems staggering. However, you quickly realise that there are far fewer paths to victory than at first appear, and then you hear about the all-conquering Halifax Hammer. It may be difficult to pull off, but the game is fundamentally broken as if both players play to win, the game will always more or less go down the same route. 

Some can  "forget" the optimal strategy and  enjoy the experience of the game. I can't. To dismiss those who enjoy playing the game with the goal of winning as anally retentive min-max optimisers is a silly caricature used to defend a fundamentally flawed product. Indeed, if you don't play with a thin deck, the game gets rather boring as both players end up spending ages going through their deck looking for the card combination they need to do anything.

There are plenty of robust two-player games out there that tell a narrative yet hold up to competitive play. Why would I ever choose to play AFAoS over one of those?

Traded for Mythtopia (mistake!).

I enjoyed the theory of this game, but I just found the constant shuffling to be so cumbersome. I hope this becomes an online game, because having a digital shuffler will enhance the experience of the game so much. I kept playing the Home Support and right behind it was the replay card. Also my military cards would get clumped together. I hate insufficient randomization, but you have to shuffle so often in this game that it just gets cumbersome.

Interesting game, a lot I was not clear on on my first game.  It takes a CDG and mixes it with a deck building game.  I miss the lake of events like Twilight Struggle has but it might make the hand management aspect of the game to easy if there were easy to play useful events.
Needs another play.

12/29/11  Two plays online and 3 more in progress.  I think it is hopelessly broken in favor of the British unless I see otherwise, lowing my rating.

1/8/12 Upped my rating to 6.5, the fix seems to fix it but I am losing interest in the game somewhat.

3/28/12 Downed my rating to 5.5 as the fix does not go far enough and still heavily favors the brits.

The controversy surrounding this game is instructive, and an important discussion. It seems a shame though that so many people who haven't actually played the game have written it off as broken as a result. For me, a neat game, and one of the first really great games to follow Dominion using a deck-building mechanism - more importantly the first board game to successfully fuse deck building into its play - My opinion, of course, with little regard for the dissenters. I haven't played enough to run in to the Halifax Hammer - if I did, or if I generally found deck-thinning overpowered, I'd probably follow Mantuanwar's suggested variant rather than Mr Wallace's proposed fix - but it hasn't come up, so we've just played RAW. It's a really beautiful production too, if you find any appeal in the Treefrog aesthetic, and represents its chosen period of history beautifully.

RATING: 7
A very hard game to find an appropriate rating for at the moment. After being somewhat sceptical the game has been demonstrated to me to be either broken or so close to it that it's splitting hairs. (A rough form of this strategy was being played by us before it dawned on us that this was the best way for the British to play. Only later did it acquire a name and a brain free process of enactment.) This ruins the enjoyment somewhat of an otherwise very fine game. Players wanting a fun game try to stay clear of the offending strategy, but it feels like there's an elephant in the room. I've dropped my rating down to a six (not broken, but based on my desire to keep playing a game where I have to ignore this elephant), where I expect it will remain until a fix is provided by the designer that restores the challenge and fun to the game. The 2nd edition "fix" is NOT that fix.

The only fix I've found for the Halifax Hammer is to play with someone who agrees they won't play it. The Brits can still win by taking Quebec, but they can't take it by playing in a way resembling the HH. Alternatively not allowing the governor to offload starting towns (unless those towns have been captured), can also be fun even if the game is now most likely to be won by the Brits, but not guaranteed.
------------
There is a danger playing with inexperienced players that they might discard location cards that will then lead the game to get stuck in a rut as they waste turns to reacquire them. Either warn them this can happen, or implement a house rule for newbies that players can't discard location cards until they've been turned into cites or been expanded from. I've been in a game where it's gummed up and it's no wonder players are unimpressed by the game when this happens.

Reading the rules I was sceptical. How was this going to work? It seemed a bit hopeful to build a deck building mechanic into a themed game and not come away with an abstract feeling game pasted onto a serious wargame. Well, it is all a bit abstract, but through small differences between the British and French decks it retains enough of an historical simulation to pull it off. And does it ever succeed in pulling it off! As I abandon more and more the abstract games from my precious gaming time, this game gives me that themed game feeling with a card play system that is different for wargames and really works to provide me with an entertaining game.

What strikes me is how many choices a player has to approach the game. Say you're playing the French. Do you attempt to build up your siege troops, or push your settlements out for a quick end to the game? Geographically where are you going to spread out? Should you play raid cards into your reserve readying for ambushes and assaults, or do you try and build them up in your hand for a series of surprise attacks. (Surely your opponent can't block you twice in a turn, or can they?) What's your opponent doing in their reserve? Surely you'd better react, but you want to build up a useful combination of cards that's not just going to block your hand up for the next turn.

All the time you're paying attention to the little things like how many cards do you have left in your draw pile. How many does your opponent? Try and select the optimal time to buy, the best time to raid a particular settlement or town.

Then play the other side and it's a completely different style of play with different quirks to consider. The French with their lack of settlement cards. The British weaker in trading income. The French with their more useful militia. The British with their ship income.

Okay, this is a very simple to play game that'll give me many, many plays before I'll get tired of it.

Man, do I hate this game. Got halfway through and gave up. 

You need combinations of cards in order to do anything. You start with cards that don't seem very good, but a few of them are versatile. As you add cards to your deck, they are generally only used for one thing, making your deck even streakier. You can spend multiple turns cycling through your deck in order to actually be able to do something. This may be thematic, but it is not fun. The military and raiding actions are unsatisfying, and the game plays way too slowly. Actually none of the actions you can perform are satisfying, but the military actions stand out as being particularly unsatisfying. 

It was pretty clear by the time I gave up on the game that the only way to play well is to use the card that removes cards from your deck to make your deck efficient. In order to do that well, you would need to analyze all of the cards for your faction ahead of time to see what you should remove. Doing so removes most of the decision making from the game, and requires you to perform a tedious analysis before playing. 

It's such a cool idea, but the implementation is horrible in practice.

It's not merely that this game is broken, but also that Martin Wallace seems resigned to the fact that you have to sacrifice balance for asymmetry and thematic authenticity (as seen in Brass, which also has unintended strategies, but is held together by having no asymmetry), and that asymmetric 2-player games are impossible to balance. That's not true. Maybe he can get David Sirlin to help with development.

Even if the game weren't broken, it's lackluster for me. AFAoS's claim to fame is "board-izing" Dominion, and slapping on a theme that makes sense (hiring mercenary forces takes a while for them to come over from Europe, so the card goes in your deck, not hand). But it's disappointing to me that the board doesn't feel like a board sometimes (some locations look like they should be adjacent, but then when you look at the actual cards, it says they're not, or only adjacent for one of the players). And the biggest letdown for me was the menu of options on your turn. There is a bevy of things you can do for your turn, but most of these are just formalized extensions of Dominion's many cards (chain, acquire, thin, cycle, build). The end-result is nothing that feels groundbreaking, and is too clunky and weird compared to Dominion's simple, streamlined system.

I'm not a fan of Wallace-style menu of action options for your 2 actions a turn. Feels like lazy game design to me.

Limited Edition Signed Copy 128/1000.

[10 plays] I'm very happy with my purchase and pretty darned pleased with how the first play went. There's a lot going on here (rules aren't bad, but the broad palette of options can be daunting at first). I'm really looking forward to playing this a bunch more and the learning and exploring of strategies and tactics.

The components are all great (and I think the basic pieces would be just fine too) and the artwork is nice. The rules are very well done (this is not a typical Wallace strong point). There's a nice amount of angst here, and the theme is well integrated to the gameplay. I love the map. Dang I'm happy with this so far, the more I think about it the more I want to play again right now.

Update 5/13 -- British need to play a bit more like a wargame and France needs to play a bit more like an empire expansion game. Building and maintaining an effective deck may be the most important and most difficult part of playing this game well.

It's no real surprise to hear that this game has flaws.

Look at Martin's publishing schedule: he's pumping out 3-4 Treefrog games a year, probably designing for other companies (licensed games etc) and also running a games publishing business.

How much time does that leave for true playtesting of designs?

Not much I'd reckon.

RATING: 8
2nd edition: April 2012 (with updated rules to fix balance issues)

Update: Seems that the updated rules didn't improve balance but even made it [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/8455499#8455499]worse[/url].

Will now finally test this myself ...

Update: The Halifax Hammer strategy must be implemented flawlessly to make it succeed.
Since I have no intention (or ability) to do this, this dominant strategy is no problem for me.
This is a very good game, and surprisingly not as scripted as its spiritual successor Hands in the Sea.

Kétszemélyes háborús eurogame. Pakliépítős, Londonra hajazó csak más körítésben. Francia - angol párharcról szól a játék története az Észak-Amerika feletti uralomért. A város és faluhelyek fixek a játékban, nekem a fő gondom főleg ezzel volt, hogy nem érzek benne sok játékot, mert az igaz, hogy a kártyák miatt minden parti más, de adott kártyákból egyértelmű mi a legjobb akcióválasztás. Nagyon sok akciólehetőség van, de nagyon könnyű kizárni a gyengéket a lapok láttán. A harcrendszer jól ki van találva, többféleképpen lehet megszerezni egymás falu és városjelző korongjait. A játék végét kiváltó egyik feltétel valamelyik fél falu vagy városkorongjainak elfogyása. Szabály alapján is nekem egyértelműnek tűnt erre a stratégiára rámenni, háború nélkül csak fejlődni és működött. Nem tudom mennyire zavaró lehet egy háborús játékban csata nélkül nyerni, de nekem kicsit fura volt. Összességében jó téma, sokféleképpen variálható pakli, de mégsem érzek benne sok játéklehetőséget és a hódítás sem túl kifizetődőnek látszik elsőre. Szóval vegyesek az érzések, nekem a London jobban bejött.

[2015-10-31]
Ismét ugyanúgy zajlott a parti, mint 3 évvel ezelőtt, azaz a francia tulajdonképpen hódítás nélkül nyert simán terjeszkedéssel. Ettől függetlenül látom benne a pontenciált és érzem, hogy meg lehet fogni jó pakliépítéssel ezt a stratégiát. Egy kicsit azért a franciát érzem az új szabályokkal erősebbnek. Emelek egyet a ponton. 6->7

In my honest opinion, Wallace's masterpiece. The way the logistic difficulties and dilated times of this colonial conflict are conveyed through deck managing is unbelievably smooth and clever. The theme does shine through this one. I did hear claims of brokenness due to a favoured mechanics, but I'm not bothered as I won't read the threads and probably won't play frequently enough to find out!

RATING: 8
This game introduces a brilliant idea in combining deck-building with a campaign map. Plays quite smoothly, and does what many wargames fail to do via incorporating the logistical, political, and economic downsides of a military campaign. For example, there's a certain paranoia involved when the French start recruiting Indian allies for raids forcing the British to clog their deck with fortifications and counter-raids reducing the effectiveness of both their economic and military engines. I also enjoy the asymmetrical aspects of the game with the massive British colonies on one side and the rapidly expanding inland French setttlements on the other. I do think the game just about misses out on greatness because a few aspects are not fully worked out. Seems to me that the British can too easily overwhelm the French along the coast.

Fascinating game. At first it almost felt like the number of options available to you was overwhelming, and unless you put effort into trimming down your deck it can seem quite random towards the end, but I can see this getting very, very interesting after a few plays.

This is very rapidly becoming one of my favourite games ever. Especially with the new changes. It remains to see if this can stay fresh after many games, but I'll really enjoying figuring that out by playing it a whole bunch.

RATING: 7.5
A great game -- deck-building with an actual game attached to it! It's a wargame, though; not my usual choice in games. However, it's simple enough that, at least against another wargame neophyte, I can probably do sort of OK. 

Some official rule changes to try (and FAIL) to fix the broken Halifax Hammer strategy from the original game:
1. Remove the French bateaux card from the initial deck and place it with the availble cards.

2. Reserve - you cannot place location cards in your reserve.

3. Raids - the raid distance is now two connections plus one connection for each additional card played (so playing two Native American cards would allow you to raid a location up to three connections away).

4. Home Support - you can only take cards from your draw deck, so if you had fewer than three cards available you would only be able to draw these. Consequently, the only time you shuffle your discard pile is when you need to refill your hand at the end of the turn and your draw deck is exhausted.

This seems to be a great system! Unfortunately, I just can't seem to figure out how to play the French competitively. And the British seem to have one main path: thin the deck, buy military, and crush the French! After several plays, it's getting to be more frustrating than interesting!

After initially rating it 8, I have to drop the rating a bit ... there's just too much emphasis on the Halifax Hammer. But it's still such a neat game!

After playing a bit with the new random rules generator, rating crawling up a bit to 7.5 for now.

--- Random Rule Generator ---
Before the game, determine 3 different rules by rolling two dice (first for group, second for rule).

GROUP 1-2
1) Pay 1 coin when reshuffling your deck (if you cannot, discard 2 cards after refilling the hand to 5).
2) One fortification disc in Louisburg during setup.
3) French instant win if he builds a city in Fort Duquesne.
4) If you do not block an ambush, remove a vulnerable card from your hand, reserve or siege (in the last case, modify siege track accordingly).
5) 3 Regular Infantry cards are removed from the English Empire (they cannot be bought).
6) French player can discard a card from his hand and draw a new card whenever a siege is resolved (before taking any action).

GROUP 3-4
1) Locations cards can be put in Reserve.
2) English player adds "Boat" card to his starting deck.
3) A blocked ambush is not considered an action.
4) A blocked pillage is not considered an action.
5) One fortification disc in Quebec during setup.
6) Both players can play a card with a "Fur" as a free action to gain 1 coin.

GROUP 5-6
1) When you discard, you may discard how many cards you like (for free).
2) French player adds any one card from his Empire to his starting deck.
3) If you put a Location card back into the available cards, then you lose control of that location.
4) Natives have a military power of 1 and can be used during sieges.
5) English player cannot start a siege until the French player starts one OR he has 25 Victory Points.
6) If you lose control of a location, you may remove its card from your hand as a free action.

Interesting game, but plays too fast for me.   I prefer to have more time between turns to think through strategy.  There are many other games I would play before this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I will admit that my dislike of this game after 1 play may be a bit unfair.  I found myself in what is possibly an uncommon situation and that ruined the game for me but I'm willing to give this one another shot to see if there was something there that was robbed from me in that first play.

This is a deck builder with some war game elements.  There is a static map setup based on some historic war and the cards you play each turn determine your expansion and siege of different areas of the map.

Now let me explain where this game went horribly, horribly wrong in my first play.  I played the French side and my opponent took a location in my area on the very first turn so I decided to try to take that location back early before he had an opportunity to entrench himself.  Now I'm not a war game player and I don't even win that often playing Risk Legacy with my usual group so maybe this was a simple mistake in game play but what ensued really spoiled this game for me.

First, I don't know that I could have won because I played it well (in my non-war gamer opinion anyway) and still lost.  I bolstered my attack each turn and spent my money on new units to bolster it even more but every progress I made was easily taken down by the British player.  He started with a smaller deck and much more money so was able to cycle through it, buy more useful cards, and get to them faster than me and eventually (more inevitably) won the battle.  Meanwhile I spent resources crowding my deck with military units but not the transportation cards needed to get to the locations I needed to attack.

The deck makeup for the French player doesn't seem as good as the British.  I only started with 2 ship symbols and literally no location in the available deck had ship symbols on it and it would have cost an action and 6 gold to buy just a ship card (which is much more inefficient than the multiple ship symbols and available locations that also have other symbols and uses in the British deck).  Also the money-making potential for the French is the trader card which while possibly very lucrative (Trader + 4 fur symbols = 8 money and empties your hand), with just a single trader in the starting deck, it is hard to get to it.  There is also a similar situation with settlers which I believe the British starts with more of (The French only start with 1) and even if the British don't start with more their smaller deck makes them easier to get to anyway.

After my initial attempt at assault I found myself constantly drawing hands of cards where I literally had no good options, especially now with tons of military units in my deck and no ways to get to the locations I would want to attack.  You don't discard your hand at the end of a turn in this game so if you have a bad hand you have to spend actions AND money to discard.  If you are out of money like I found myself then you have to spend both your actions to discard just two cards from your shitty hand.  I found myself doing this 3 turns in a row before I had had it and quit the first game I can ever remember quitting without even finishing it due to having so little fun.

It is awful to spend 3 turns going "I discard two cards, go" and watch your opponent increase his board position each time and knowing you're falling further and further behind.

Like I said, I would play it again to see if this was a fluke but my gut is telling me because of some of the design of the game (the British vs. the French deck and the no discard rule) and how awful things did go that this isn't really just a fluke...

RATING: 5
I like most of Martin's designs, but this one, I'm not so sure about. There are some very clever mechanisms going on, but the game is much longer than it needs to be, and there is a great deal of down time as players struggle to make do with too few resource cards. Battles can also drag on indefinitely, and small skirmishes/raids are simply not as important in game as they were during the actual FIW.

I don't think this is a bad game, but at the moment, our general impression is that there's simply too much going on in some places, too little going on in others to make for one cohesive package.

I had a really nice first impression although the game have taken forever to play! But I think that every first Few Acres of Snow game should last a long time because players don't focus on what they should do to win. I compare this lack of objectivity to Antiquity, which is also a terrific game that makes players go around the main goal and do beautiful unnecessary things.
After my first play I can now say that I am probably ready to give it a decent try out.
I like unbalanced playing strategies (but only if all players have the same possibility of winning the game) and I have the feeling that FA of Snow is one of those balanced games with totally different strategies to follow when playing with France or England and that's not only very hard to accomplish but also very fun to see in a game.
Another good thing I enjoy a lot is that the game doesn't have a very remarkable war-game feeling too. Players settle a lot and develop a lot and make only a few sieges during the game. I think that raids are the most simple and (maybe) powerful warfare mechanic in A Few Acres of Snow but they don't represent that heavy "destroy something" feeling, which I like. It's kind of a war for wimps with a small civ feeling.
Still need to play it again a couple of times more to understand better how long does it take.

I have played this twice as the French and loved every minute of the game. I suspect the rating can only go down, but what a joy to play.

This  Economic/military game is the perfect home for the build a deck, manage and play it mechanic. There appear to be multiple paths to victory for both sides, with a genuine ability to customize your deck - though there is enough interaction that players really need to heed the opponents deck building strategy. The asymmetrical strengths and goals of the combatants adds to the appeal. My favourite Wallace since Automobile. Any worries I had about the number of potential actions were dispelled on first play - they are not overwhelming, and are mainly determined by your hand so there might only be 3 or 4 choices each hand and turns come around very quickly. Whilst each hand determines play there can be a little more deliberation over the stragic direction of your deck, and on of the pleasurable agonies of the game is taking a quiet turn of no progress (for example discarding cards , to draw into a combo you want to play). all the while you are convinced your opponent is making better progress than you.

Another aspect of play is hand management to enable a continual cycle of cards - it can be easy to get stuck with a hand you cant play, if you don't have cards that work well together (Trader,Fur or ships, Colonists)

I hope this could become a template for future economic/wargames and don't see why it would not work multi player as well

Odds on to win IGA 2 player game 2011 - in fact id say the book was closed

CDG + Dominion the war game? V interesting use of deck building mechanic and a map to recreate an economic/military conflict. Can't wait for this one, it looks like the build a deck mechanic might work well here. Worries are number of actions and speed of game.

------------------------------------------
I understand the game is ' broken' - that's not spoilt my enjoyment of the game (I don't know and have not played against the strategy) - if so it's a shame that it was not picked up however it does not diminish my admiration for the design concept

I really want to love this game -- it uses deckbuilding, which I think is a very interesting mechanic, it adds a board and player interaction but for some reason this falls a little flat for me.  The games we've played have felt a little "samey" to me, and I was kind of bored by the end.  Need to play a few more times, but this isn't a game where I sit and think about all of the different possible things I could have done to win.  Instead, I've kind of been relieved when it ends.

A really astounding design. I'm not usually a fan of deck-building games: the luck factor is frustrating; the shuffling is tedious. This one is something special. The reserve, the sieges, the location cards and the ambushes are all brilliant twists on deck management -- based on previous history, any one of those innovations would've been enough for someone to launch yet another lame Dominion clone; the fact that they're combined here with board mechanisms in a way that is both novel, strategic [i]and thematic[/i] is mindblowing.

As for how it plays, well, we cocked up the first game something shocking and spent close to three hours in a tedious war of fortification. By the end it was obvious how much we'd missed, and I very much look forward to future plays.

Una guerra combattuta al confine di due possenti imperi. Per oltre centocinquant’anni l’Inghilterra e la Francia condussero una lotta serrata per il dominio del Nord America. A migliaia di chilometri dalle loro terre natie, coloni e soldati dovettero far fronte a impenetrabili foreste, imprevedibili tribù americane e a distanze smisurate. Nonostante questi ostacoli, riuscirono a ingaggiare numerose aspre battaglie, e alla fine fu l’Inghilterra a reclamare il premio del Quebec. Pochi Acri di Neve è un gioco per due giocatori che vi consente di ricreare questa contesa. Con le vostre azioni potrete cambiare il corso della storia.

Pochi Acri di Neve fa uso di un approccio innovativo alle meccaniche di gioco, utilizzando una serie di carte per rappresentare i luoghi e la potenza delle forze militari. Con il procedere della partita, ogni giocatore amplia la sua serie di carte e aumenta la gamma di azioni a sua disposizione.

Le strategie da esplorare sono molteplici: la velocità con cui intendete ammassare le vostre forze, il coinvolgimento dei nativi americani, e la quantità di energie da dedicare all’economia. Il gioco non si limita ai semplici combattimenti: dovrete riuscire a colonizzare le vostre terre per avere una speranza di vittoria.

Wallace has successfully taken the Dominion engine and made it into an actual game.  The mechanics of this game are fantastic to be sure.  I find a lot of flaw in the following ideas:

1. There are certain cards that either side MUST buy.  This makes the game feel sort of scripted.

2.  There's not a lot of conflict.

3.  This is a Euro-game, not a war game.

4.  At heart, this is a simple optimization game.

I think this is a fine game and I like it well enough.  I don't think this is as good as the majority of people do.  It's fine and I'd play it again, but it's not amazing.

RATING: 9
Card drafting game with a strong wargame element. It's obviously inspired by 'Dominion' and unlike the many other games that have taken the deck building mechanism and failed to improve on it, 'A Few Acres of Snow' does something radically different whereby you use your cards to control movements, development (economic and building) and battles, and in doing so becomes a quite magnificent game. It's a two player game set in the North American war between Britain and France and both sides have to employ a quite different strategy from one another i.e the British use greater finances and ability to settle areas whilst the French use Native American resources to ambush and raid. This is a genuinely intriguing game to play and certainly one of Martin Wallace's finest designs.

Incredible climate, very enjoyable. The game core is stolen from Dominion, but it's used here so smartly! The players have many options to manipulate their decks. And with asymmetric forces and a number of very interesting openings, the game replayability seems to be high. Moreover, the theme is tightly sewed to the mechanics. A very good design.

There is also an issue of a broken British strategy: "a. minimise you deck, b. get much gold, c. buy army and capture Port Royal (Halifax), Louisbourg and Quebec". While I think it's beatable in some cases, IMHO the game needs a slight correction. 
The most promising and recent solution has been proposed [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7903369#7903369][u]here[/u][/url]: the Home Support cards are available only after a player captures an opponent disk. IMHO Louisbourg should also be fortified from the game start. I played three times with these two particular corrections and liked it much. 
Anyway, the game is really, really good despite this issue. 

Update: Official rules changes have been presented [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8136728#8136728][u]here[/u][/url].

Wow, massively frustrating.  Yeah I just love having nothing to do on a turn because of crappy card combos.  the problem is that you only have a five card hand and sometimes need 3+ cards to do what you need to do.  Way too much randomness here.  Big big disappointment...

Ok, tried again.  Simply broken.  Brits:  Halifax, Looisburg, Quebec.  No game here, just a boring exercise in conquering Quebec.

Interesting idea of combining deckbuilding with a wargame. And it does work.

In our play, we grind to a very slow British victory with the French pulling out a surprise victory by deploying all their cubes. I thought they needed also their discs to be deployed :-D

Anyway, with a competent British player (grab halifax, grab forts, don't ever raid, put forts down as far to the French lines as you can but at minimal in Fort Halifax, Fort Wim Henry, Albany and on the 'left' trail by getting the bateaux in your deck at the beginning as well) can't seem the French take a victory so it feels kinda tilted. Therefore rating goes down a point. Otherwise a very good clean design and enjoyable to play.

An interesting and challenging game, that excellently employs a deck building mechanic to create an ebb and flow in a not too deep wargame. With multiple paths to victory, and a need to balance what you are doing and keeping an eye on your opponent, its a great meeting of a wargame and a eurogame.

Got to play a game of this before Christmas and it was very enjoyable.  Easy to set up, easy to understand and straightforward in it's game play.  The artwork on the box is amazing.  Not a super quick game though so it's one of those 'be prepared' to engage fully with it.

This game is genius.

Yeah, yeah I know about the Halifax Hammer and all that.  But a game that can inspire so many to try to break it, is f****ing awesome.

I have played this with a variety of people with very different gaming experiences and all have loved its wonderful deck building with a purpose.

Deck-building + a map = wonderful conveyance of history, and a very innovative means for simulating asymmetric conflict.  (Maybe too innovative?) In any case, despite clearly being a superior design, the jury is still out on this one.  Namely, is the replayability there? Is it possible to counter the HH dominant strategy? If so, it's a possible 10.

I truly hope Wallace goes on to develop more historical games using this system.  

Rating will be revisited periodically.

Fascinating use of the deck-building mechanic in support of a wargame. The deck-building is used to abstract supplies, transportation, and support. Managing your deck often overshadows your position on the map, but I never lost track of the fact that I was playing a wargame where position mattered. The map and artwork are beautiful. The replayability seems high. Yes, I've heard about the "unbeatable" or "broken" strategy. But, for now, I can still enjoy the game as a glimpse of how deck-building can be used for more than just another Dominion clone.

People tell me the game is broken. As long as I'm having fun with it (which I do even when I lose on either side), I don't care!

EDIT: The too long gameplay, and the 2p limitation made sure I don't get it to the table often. Mythotopia's release made me trade it away.

A Few Acres of Snow is pretty challenging, but not overwhelming. It really does play in an hour, which is great. it also plays very differently depending on whether players focus on building vs. raids vs. protracted sieges. All of this I like very much. It's a little disturbing that at least one and possible more strategies (by the British) are generally being acknowledged as unstoppable, therefore "breaking" the game. While that gives me pause, I haven't played this enough to have seen this in action ... the couple of games I've played have been close affairs. Suffice to say, I hope Martin Wallace comes out with revised rules that fix the problems that have been exposed. In the meantime, it's the old joke: "Doctor, it hurts when I move like this." "Well, don't do that." There's plenty to explore here without going down the broken path, and the journey is rewarding. A Few Acres of Snow successfully melds Dominion-like deck-building with Euro mechanics and a light war game theme. So far, I'm enjoying this one.

This is an excellent utilization of deck building in a board game.  Up there with the best that I've played.

The "Halifax Hammer" imbalance seems overblown based on my first play.  So long as both players are aware of it, they control how imbalanced it is.  There's nothing wrong with there being locations that have greater strategic value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First of all: the game gets a -1,5 penalty for its rulebook. Get the f..... structure right! If you have elements on the board explain them first instead of explaining details that are in context with the element and then one or two pages later the element. This is driving me mad,because until I read about the element-part, I think I overread something and start to flip forward and backward in pages. Also, how about a keyword glossary? 

Concerning the game itself: this take on deck-building is interesting, but the game seems unfinished. I know of course about the Halifax Hammer.To be precise: I know that it's there. I didn't read about it because I didn't want to spoil the game for me. I never play games to the extent where I'd be coming close to find a game-breaking strategy. But it's not the Halifax Hammer I'm talking about.

What I found more disturbing is the power of raids vs. actually besieging someone. Besieging is something you have to prepare by longhand and you need tons of cards without even knowing if it works out in the end.Raids are so supereasy to do. And they are probably even more so when played by the French but in this case the British player had almost all Native Americans to his hand. The British player never had to besiege and with all his cards with settle-ability the British player never besieged the French player in this game for once. And the French player, already pretty locked and without options to spread out could just sit there and gaze for an hour waiting for the evident (i.e. the British victory) to happen. The British player jsut settled from one place to the next, developed the villages he already had one by one and the french player had no chance whatsoever to interfere. 

Probably this was an unusual constellation, but speaking of balancing I don't know where the strengths of the French player are supposed to be in the beginning. It's not the money (even with the trader you won't come close to the financial power of the Brits) and it feels like you're locked in your starting position apart from the Nova Scotia peninsula. 
I'd have a few ideas on how to play the Fench differently the next time. I just don't see it happen anytime soon.

Thanks, Santa! I think this one will see a lot of table time!

Update: I seem to adore this more than everyone else local -- if only Dano lived a little closer!

Ignore the epic threads about how allegedly broken the game is.  Unless you set out to break it, you're not going to just accidentally stumble across the Halifax Hammer.  What you'll probably do is play and enjoy several games, in which the English will win slightly more than the French, maybe.  Hey, they won the real thing -- I'm OK with a little bias.

One of the big strengths of this game is its asymmetry. I think this throws a lot of people, but it keeps it in touch with its theme.  No, France, you are unlikely to win a military victory.  That's OK!  You were unlikely to win one back then, too.

I just don't get this one. I've played twice and both games were cut short because we had been playing for 3+ hours with no end in sight. It's one of those games where the game CAN'T end IF (insert here) is happening. It's a rare ending condition and this sort of emphasizes why.

I don't have a clear idea what I'm trying to accomplish with my deck, and the improvements made each turn are deceptively miniscule in a way that drags out the game simply because I'm trying to FIND the puzzle to solve. But, in general, my main problem is that I just don't find the act of "playing" with these mechanisms to be fun. I make mini-goals for myself, but then it takes forever to accomplish them.

Maybe I just don't have the patience for it. I think I'm too millennial for this game.

The best, most engaging Maths homework I've ever played.

In seriousness, this is a great competitive two-player game, but be warned that it /will/ give you a headache. It's incredible at what it does, and that's simulating impenetrable bureaucracy. You don't fight your opponent so much as try (and fail) to coerce your deck into cooperating with you. Recommended to anyone that would sacrifice moment to moment "fun" for the intense thrill when your deck finally - finally - spits out the right combination of cards.

Short in scope deck building, card management game with a well intergrated theme and a wargame set-up. 

It's well designed, allows for a plethora of strategies and tactical considerations and makes for a solid (if exceptionally limited) experience. The theme also works well. The game is very enjoyable while it lasts.

AfAoS is, among other things, a tactical wargame with only one scenario and almost no luck. That's a terrible combination, as all available strategies will "quickly" and inevitably be exausted until only one remains. The absense of luck ensures that every game from then on will play the same, as there is no significant random factor to affect a play midgame.

In short this game literally self destroys. Once it reaches a critical number of plays, the dominating strategy is finally found and the game loses ALL of its replayability. Depending on the player skill, enthusiasm and forum reading this might take anything between 0 and 100 plays to realise. By definition, this "near miss of a great game", is unfortunately broken.

A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player, card-driven game about the French and British conflict in North America.
The card-play contains a focus on a deck-building mechanic similar to Dominion, and like many card-driven war games, each card will have multiple uses. The players have to choose only one aspect of the card to use when it is played. Each space captured by a player will add another card to the capturing player's deck.
From the box description:
A war fought at the edge of two mighty empires. For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances. Despite these obstacles they were able to engage in bitter warfare, with the British ultimately taking the prize of Quebec. A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest. You can change the course of history by your decisions.
A Few Acres of Snow takes an innovative approach to the subject, using cards to represent locations and manpower. As the game progresses you add to your selection of cards, increasing the range of actions available to you. There are many strategies to be explored. How quickly should you build up your forces, do you employ Native Americans, what energy should be expended on your economy?
The game is about more than just fighting – you must successfully colonize the land to have a chance.

Our first play was great fun. The second one less so, as a military attack by one player in a critical area forces the other player to commit as well, bogging the game into a cycle of fundraising and mustering.

Rating after two plays. So far, it seems that this is my favorite game from my Essen 2011 shopping list! Our first play took almost 3 hours, which proves that there is a lot of room to improve our deckbuilding strategies. Because as far as I am concerned, this is mainly a deckbuilding game with some strategic manoeuvering and lots and lots of theme. During the course of the game, you really need to adapt your deck to your changing needs, or else you will not be able to achieve any of your goals. After our first play, my girlfriend (who normally likes much lighter games) and I discussed what had happened, and we are both anxious to test a better strategy next time. I love it when games make you want to do that. The only drawback that I can think of so far (but it is quite a big one), is that you NEED to read the FAQ and errata before your first play. Oh, and that it is hard in my case to bring such an involved two player only game to the table on a regular basis.

This is the only game I've played that is truly broken. I know people say to 'ignore the broken strategy' or 'don't look it up and you'll never know about it', but those statements are entirely untrue in my experience. In both games I played with new players, the 'broken' strategy was initially apparent to both of them. It's the most optimal turn 1 play. It's hard to avoid having a lopsided game due to this, and the designer refuses to provide an official fix, so it's hard for me to enjoy this too much.

All I can say is that it's about freakin' time someone used deck building as a mechanic and not a game. And as a mechanic it works beautifully and thematically in A Few Acres of Snow to represent supply lines and the resource limits of your small settlements.

We love the game but so far it's been more building and expansion with a minimum of battling.  Exploring different strategies has added variety but they mostly extend the playing time.  The newly posted rules may help with some of the known problems with the game.

RATING: 8
I had heard mixed things about this game, specifically about a degenerate strategy.  There seem to be any of a number of house rules that could nuke the strategy, but that aside, I'm definitely a fan.  The simple idea of combining deck-building with something that, you know, isn't just deck-building shouldn't be revolutionary, but it is.  We've finally got a deck-building that dares to use the mechanic for something other than just building the deck, and it shines.  The theme is not a common one, and it lends itself well to sporadically predictable drawing.  One of Wallace's best games, and there's intriguing fodder for more here.  I'd love to see this game ported to other conflicts, Paths of Glory style.  GMT, are you listening?

One game so far, first game for both of us, the game was not very fast nor full of great tactics. Basically we were just doing what we could with the cards we had not thinking about too far in the future. There were only two sieges in the game, both started and lost by me. No raids. I won after settling all my cubes to the board.

The Dominion-style mechanic to gather more cards to do more actions feels like a nice idea, but this game needs more plays to really find how much depth there is. There is also only one scenario, so I don't know how long this game will be interesting. However, couple of more games would be welcome.

I like the way that the deck-building element of the game is just that, an element, instead of being the whole game.  I do like deck-builders, but when they all feel the same, it's hard to find one that gives a new experience over Dominion (which, I should add, still does that part best).  It took me a while to figure out the best tactics to use in the game, but once they clicked, it made sense.  I hope to play this more often so I can delve a bit deeper into what the game can offer.

The main premise of this game is using deck building mechanics to simulate logistical delays in a pre-industrial war and it's simply brilliant. Being a detail heavy Martin Wallace game there is a lot to digest, but as it is card driven most of the time you only need to work with two or three options out of the 15 or so possible actions. Thankfully, once you play a turn or two it all becomes pretty intuitive.

It's too bad the Halifax Hammer debacle derailed this one. I don't doubt it exists, but it is not something you are going to run into until you've played it 10 or 20 times, if you figure it out at all. Without that controversy, I think this might have started a whole new sub-genre of war game, as happened with the COIN System. There have been a couple, but it just hasn't taken off, which is too bad because the system is really clever.

I'll keep my fingers crossed that the new "Hands in the Sea" mod will get this ball rolling again.

I really hate this kind of deckbuilding. How that one card you don't use gets stuck in your hand and deckbuilding is usually fast, but this makes it feel so slow. You don't even get to build your deck that much, just change it a little. Otherwise the game is just ... meh.

2nd edition. Good game, but rather slow, and your planning is obscured from you, so changes on the map are a lot slower (visible) than in customary wargames. Liked the nod to Dominion, but wished there were more deck control between Home Control and the Governor. The deck you get moves very slowly, and once it's cumbersome it'll take 20 minutes to bring it up back to speed. I'd give this game a much higher rating if it was a 1 hour game.

RATING: 5
This game and Quarriors are proof that my negative response to the deck building genre is mostly unwarranted.  I'll probably never care for noninteractive deck-building, but deck-building tied to strategic boardplay (settling, raiding) and combat seems to be right up my alley. 

I'm not sure how I'll react if future games of Acres end up being mostly double solitaire, but I suppose that's up to me and my opponent.  And since I'll always be one of the two players in the game, that's highly unlikely.

[i]Update:[/i]

Over the past few years, I've had a reversal of opinion on deck-building.  I still dislike Dominion and its dry cousins, but I now enjoy thematic deck-builders such as Legendary, Hogwarts Battle, and Attack on Titan.  The co-op versions are particularly fun.

That opinion has not carried over to AFAoS, unfortunately. There are multiple features of the Acres system that are dull and frustrating.  Too much Euro and not enough War.  Card-driven board expansion isn't very interesting, nor is the development of towns into cities.  Nor is staring at your hand when you don't have much to do.

And let's not even get into the broken Hammer strategy, which I've avoided learning anything about. But the fact that it exists (still) warrants a ratings nosedive.

This is the most played game in my collection (counting Yucata). I love this game; it's frustrating in all the right ways. Securing VPs comes at the cost of fattening your deck and thereby makes the player in the lead increasingly vulnerable. For this reason the game always feels tight, and despite what people say about the Halifax Hammer, we've seldom used it. It either doesn't seem the best play or fails outright, and while we aren't the best AFAoS players in the world, we certainly aren't bad either. In fact, I think only one of our games has ended with the fall of Quebec. 

We've logged incredible come from behind wins and several games that came down to the wire. I usually want to play again immediately.

I'd say this game is good for at least 30 plays. I still want to play it, but as you learn the game beyond this point the joy of discovery ebbs and the emphasis shifts more to precise strategic play. The latter can be both exciting and exhausting, depending on how often you do it.

I'm very excited to see where designers take the card-drafting + area control mechanic. This is probably my favorite style of game.

Selling a broken game: bad.  Releasing a fix, after a period of silence, that doesn't fix anything - worse.  Being passive-aggressive about that release and snidely insulting the people that brought the issue to your attention and the forum on which you are communicating - bloody awful.  Implying that all wargames are flawed just like the game you just designed...  lordy.  Game traded.

On the other hand, one can have endless fun creating spoof names for this mess of a game.  My current favorite:  A FEW BOXES OF FAIL.

Yeah it favors the lean British deck.  So what?  Some of us not only love but need a bit of asymmetry and the challenge of the underdog side. Also it's only the Treefrog edition which usually lead to a reprint more polished anyways. In other words i'm really not worried of it exhausting options as I'm sure some options for shifting asymmetry will be coming.

In the meantime if you are the kind of gamer who likes the commitment to strategy that deck drafting gives, who loves to experiment with more strategies than you can digest (and not just reading online to find out what others tell you to do) you'll love this ...a lot. 

Oh. I'm also waiting for Mark Herman to do one of these as he's been active in some threads...

Interesting deck building mechanic - After a few games I have managed to win once with the French - it is a lovely game just a little difficult to find opponents since my wife is often in the mood for something lighter and she likes Legendary a lot more when it comes to deck building - though I think the competitive nature of this game has a lot going for it. I've read that it's broken but I haven't played enough of it to have any opinion on the matter.

[b]Hawkeye:[/b]


1. Terrific art.
2. Unusual game setting. The narrative depicts the bloodthirsty war raging between England and France in the American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. Brings to mind that excellent Michael Mann film, [i]Last of the Mohicans[/i].
3. Huge spread of strategy and tactics available.
4. Game has depth. Planning ahead is essential and encouraged.
5. Uses deck building and drafting in the most innovative way yet devised. Certainly a good son of Dominion.
6. Gameplay forms interesting narratives, surprisingly. A lot of laughs and fun can be gleamed from ongoing sieges, and the semi-constant guerilla warfare of raiding/looting Indians. You will find yourself talking about the game when you're done - a vigorous post-mortem of the game's events is an entertaining affair here.
7. HUGE replayability.
8. The deck building engine fits the theme like a glove, and it is here that [i]A Few Acres of Snow[/i] blasts [i]Dominion[/i] down with a Pennsylvania long rifle. There is a reason (and a great one) for the buying of cards and having them take a few turns to get back to your hand: during this historical period, supplies took months to reach where they were needed, the logistics of the time were limited; sailing ships and canoes were the order of the day. I found all the game mechanisms to fit the theme's period.
9. There's a lot more game here than the rules, cards, and components indicate. Shocking how many people rate a game from a reading of the rules. This game needs you to play and explore its intricacies. You will be rewarded.
10. Having had a few hours to think about [i]A Few Acres of Snow[/i], and nothing much else besides this morning, I truly feel that studying this game's composition is akin (at least for me) to prising open the gold lid of a Constantinople-made pocket watch, and then marvelling at the precision of the whirling, silent instrumentation within.
10. I haven't played a Martin Wallace game before, but I can say that this game is a spellbinding accomplishment. Other than [i]Waterloo[/i] and [i]Moongha Invaders[/i] (which I can't find copies of), the rest of Wallace's portfolio does not particularly appeal to me, because I find the themes he chooses as dull as dishwater, generally.
11. Assymetrical design. Also, each faction seems to possess a counter-strategym for each emerging game-conquering strategy.
12. Oodles of room for player dynamism.


[b]Chingachgook:[/b]


1. Time-sucking gameplay. Takes longer to play than the rules and cards would suggest - easily 90 minutes.
2. Somewhat daunting for a new player, with an initially bewildering array of turn options.
3. The player aids are filled with gumph, but told me nothing that I really wanted to know whilst enjoying the game. Same as every other game's player-aids then.
4, The siege rules could have been a teeny bit clearer. I would have appreciated a little bold text saying, common game mistakes, and that section then clarifying the siege rules - which are good, but play out similarly to Knizia's [i]Scarab Lords.[/i] By that I mean, they read okay, and play out well, when you fully understand them: YOU check to see if YOU meet the victory conditions, at the start of your turn.
5. Steep learning curve.

Q: [i]Why are there so few wagons/roads in this game?[/i]
A: In the wilderness, there were few bridges, many rivers, and fewer roads. Any "roads" were in name only. In actuality they were little more than crude trails carved out of the backcountry, filled with stumps and sinkholes. Travelling in America was difficult if not impossible to say the least. It was the call for a 'national road' in the 1740s that would be the catalyst for the building of any good roads - in fact, there were cries for decent roads before there was even a nation.

Batteaux, canoes and rafts where mainly used in the wilderness or undeveloped areas of the world of the time. For example in the areas covered by the game, the Natives used birch bark canoes for transportation on the major rivers. The fur traders used canoes, Batteaux, and rafts to transport their yearly take of furs to outposts for transport to market.

The Batteaux's shallow draft worked well in rivers while its flat bottom profile allowed heavy loading of cargoes and provided stability. The Colonial French and British militaries sometimes fitted the larger flat-bottomed boats with small cannon - also, many of the boats could be strung together to form pontoon bridges.



[i]Please ignore the idiot, somewhere below this note, that rated the game a '2' - he rates 'Battleship' a '4' - that says it all. It really does. This is a truly excellent game, undeserving of such a rating.[/i]

What a disappointment.  Martin Wallace is my favorite designer.  I love Euro, wargames, and weuros.  While I like the theme, this game was pretty boring waiting for the right combination of cards to show up.  Way too many turns spent churning because you had too many cards of one type and didn't have the right location or transport card to do anything.  We hit a rut where we simply could not advance any further and quit.

French-and-Indian War themed deckbuilder.  You can be French or British.  When you settle/capture a location, add the location card to your deck; pay money to add action cards to your deck.  Assault/raid/besiege your opponents' locations, trade for income, recruit soldiers, artillery, and natives, fine tune your deck, capture the most victory points (locations and opponents' pieces).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm really not sure how I feel about this yet.  I like a lot of the mechanisms, and I love the way acquiring a location provides you with resources, but increases your logistical difficulties.  It feels right; it makes sense.  What I dislike is that you can founder pretty thoroughly if you get inundated with "the wrong cards".  Unlike the [family=50][/family] games, there usually are useful things to do with the cards, unless you've snagged a bunch of locations willy-nilly, with no regard for their function.  Certainly, knowing the environment of the conflict enables you to dominate the situation over someone who doesn't.

Oh, and I also adore that the sieges are vaguely like [thing=9446][/thing], rather than anything involving dice.  You can still score a lucky win, but it's more likely if you've managed your deck (your attention to that which you rule) well.

This game, unlike dominion, you dont do whatever is in your hands, you have to plan ahead what city to fortify, develop, etc therefore holding those when they come up is crucial. Discarding  is a meaningful play in this game. I really like it becoming one of my favorite 2p games.

What makes A Few Acres of Snow excel is its unique use of mechanics (deck building) to iron home the theme (settling North America in the 17th-18th centuries).

A game combining deck building and strategy/wargames. I love to play as the French and kick British out of Canada. I enjoy the deckbuilding during the game and unlike dominion it has theme. It has simple components and the map could be smaller. Although the two sides are assymetrical, I think the game is balanced although there is rumour to exist a very boring broken strategy for easy winning with the British, until now the British have lost all games I played.

Ha!  Got my collector's edition and you don't.  But it can be yours for $1000 USD, no questions asked about its condition.  You know you want these bad-a$$ metal minis, so just hand over those hopelessly inflated, useless greenbacks and let's make a win-win deal....

RATING: 7
[2-6] There are plenty of nay-sayers with this one and I understand most of the dismissals. BUT this was it for me as a kid. This was the be-all end-all of every argument. This was my summer plan, my vacation plan, my weekend plan. My childhood friends and I even concocted an EPIC variant where every battle would be settled, not by the luck of the dice, but with a customized game of Stratego. We never finished that one. This was my grail for so many years and I'm still very very fond of it. This particular edition was one that I saved up for and cherished. I can still smell the summer days and nights when I open the box. Maybe not the best game in the world but the most memorable for me.

RATING: 4
Widely played by the masses and aimed squarely at them.  The infamous charge from Australia to sweep the board and win the game after 3 hours of play is gloriously fun for the winner and painfully slow for the other players.  The design does nothing to aid the game's play style.  Better players will likely only extend the game time to even more absurd lengths.  There are better games involving dice that should be played first.  [GTI Code: TPCL]

RATING: 5
Nice version of risk.  This uses the edition of the board with no connection between Africa and the Middle East.  One thing about the metal pieces is that with rubbing wear the pain does chip off.

Way too many plays here too, but it was my first foray into more "dense" thinking games. It's epic length in retrospect, is appropriate given its foundational position in my mind as a pillar of why I love deep, engaging gaming experiences. Whew, that was a mouthful, but I meant every word of it, this is the 40th anniversary edition and I am glad I own it, I'll play it whenever we go the time! one of the few "wargames" my wife like.

I don't know why so many like this game. It's overly simplistic and takes little to no skill for any wargamer. Please don't ask me to play. I have already played it way too many times. I just stinks.

RATING: 4
10-12 years ago this was hands down my favorite board game.  Now it really just a pain in the *ss.  I played it for the first time in almost 15 and really hated every minute of it.  If my box was not so torn up and the dice unusable I would sell this version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A gorgeous addition to the long history of RISK reincarnations. The metal armies can't be beat, in their own little velvet pouches to secure their elite status. The box is beautifully designed, as are all the components. The only feature I can fault is the board is perhaps a touch on the bland side for such a prestigious edition. But still, a version to be coveted.

Very nice version of Risk with the die-cast pieces... I have played my copy and the paint on the pieces is starting to chip away giving it a cool "antique" effect.

Sadly I'm not sure where this ended up. I don't seem to have it any more. Shame since it's actually worth $ and I don't recall actually selling it.

RATING: 6.5
Whatever my play count here is, multiple it by 100 because this game and set has seen more plays than a NES!  My copy is beaten, battered and torn, but I still love it. I thank Risk for getting me into board games as a child and for paving the way for my girl friend into this hobby as an adult. It doesn't get much play now that I've found the geek and it's Eurogames but I'm proud to own a copy of 40th Anniversary Risk. (especailly since there was no decent 50th edition in 2009!)

My delight at world domination must have begun with my father. I kick his ass at Risk, and when he wins, I kick his ass literally, (I usually fall over before connecting, though) In fact, I think it was my dad forcing me to play risk when I was young that brought out the gaming/competitive side in my brain.  Everyone likes Risk.  It's the easier Stratego.

THE EDITION:  Until I see an edition where the pieces march across the board where you tell them, to me this is the ultimate set.  The pieces are metal, and nice and heavy, the colors are beautiful, but not too bright, the board is in square panels, not rectangular...  AMAZING JOB!

THE GAME:  It's a classic, and as far as old-school boardgames go, it can't be beat.  Not too complicated, easy to keep score, easy to learn, doesn't take as long as "Axis and Allies"... and there are some really nice editions out there.

The reason we don't play it more often, is that once you've played it a few times, it's pretty predictable.  Tony grabs Australia, Billy thinks he can keep Asia for more than two turns, and I always try for the good old North America / South America combo.  After a while.. *yawn*

Really, it's a good game for a "classic", but hard to compare to the excitement that a game like "Settlers of Catan" has, where the board is different every game, and there are several expansions to shake things up.

RATING: 4
It's Risk: lots of dice, lots of downtime, the last person to take a turn can sweep through all of the weakened territories and reap massive rewards.  What's not to like?  (I recommend speed Risk, where you have 10 seconds between attacks to decide on your next move, or your turn is over.)

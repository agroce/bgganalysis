RATING: 7
Very strong, tense, rummy-type game.  As good, if not better, than some of the Mike Fitzgerald titles. The "tavern" is a wonderful idea. A lot of tension trying to decide when to go out.  Do I wait another turn to reduce my card count or do I go out now so the tavern doesn't change?  I don't find the cards a problem--they are thin but resilient and they shuffle well. There is a great deal of luck involved, but play is fast and exciting!

Lovely rummy variant for 2-4 players.  Cards feel flimsy, but have held up quite well.  Distinguishing colors can be an issue.

Not bad.  A Rummy variant with a few twists.  Reasonable fun, but not totally my thing and the cards could have been more interesting.

RATING: 7
Light and easy on the brain, this card game poses sufficient problems to be a decent card game. Decisions as to what to collect, when to take from the tavern and when to declare all make this pleasant card game well worth trying. 

Low card finish means that the cards are more flimsy than they should be and you have come to expect from games produced in the last 15 years. But this dos not detract from the value of the game.

RATING: 5.5
{1 play, 4 player} I liked it.  Rating will probably go up with subsequent play... but who knows when that'll be, as no one I know owns it, it's not really special enough for me to buy, and, well, there are just better trick-taking games out there. [initial rating: 6] Hmm... I finally played it again, 3-player, and.. my rating went down.  Mostly because each round seemed to end early.  Now that I know what I'm doing here, now that I can see some strategies, every time I was about to get one going, someone sailed and the round ended.  I'm sure this being a 3-player game was part of it, but it felt like the player who got dealt the "luckiest" cards was gonna win the round, or rather, there wasn't enough time for "unlucky" players to brilliantly do something about that fact.  I hope I'm wrong.

RATING: 7
this game has an undeserved bad reputation.  the german rules, which are downloadable at bgg, are infinitely better than the english ones.  the cardstock is super thin, but it makes shuffling over 100 cards a breeze and it holds up well.  solid rummy kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In the first aborted play, we got a crucial rule wrong, allowing people to add duplicate crew members to the captain's crew and having the duplicates be stowaways.

The next day, we tried again with the right rule -- and the German scoring -- and the game was MUCH better. So good we played three in a row.

I can easily see this becoming a favored filler for four. Quick, easy to explain, easy to catch on to. In nine games we've rarely gone past three hands!

RATING: 6
If you have avoided Colovini games in the past, then do yourself a favor and give this one a chance.  It definitely doesn't have the Colovini Feel (TM) - it plays more like a Knizia card title in many respects.  As such the theme is pointless and could have been a myriad of other options - so ignore the pirates.  There is player elimination but it is not from a pure take that mechanic.  If you aren't a fan of elimination games then you may want to avoid this one.  Give it a run with non-gamers and you'll be surprised how quickly they pick it up and want to play again. [GTI: AGCL]

Enjoying this "recruiting a pirate crew" card game a lot now, it has lasted 10 plays so far and still have a sense of discovery with it. The quality of the cards is not as bad as you read about on the geek, but I do buy the argument here that in low level light conditions, it is difficult to tell a few of the colors apart. The tavern feature of the game keeps it interesting, forcing a flexible approach to your card building tactics.

Increased rating after giving the German rules another go.  Much more interesting game (and quicker, I think).  
Cards removed from play over subsequent rounds tends to leave higher value cards in the deck.

Cards could do with a "suit" symbol for each colour.  It's not just for the colour blind - the variation in printing causes some problems even in good light.

Fun rummy type game. There is a push your luck element to this game that I really enjoy as well. Should I go just 1 more turn to make my crew better or end it now? Love those tough decisions... Corsari edition is my version,

RATING: 7
An evil Gin Rummy variant, where the brinkmanship factor is very high. If your opponents sail too soon, your voyage could be terribly expensive. It should be a [7] or better - but is massively penalised for having a crappy set of colours, some of which are quite difficult to tell apart.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial card deal results in far too much variability, allowing a player who is dealt a good hand to instantly end the hand and score a ton of points.  This alone makes this a broken game.

Still, even though it's really not a game because of this, it's still fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
aka Corsari: Good, simple set collection game with some unique ideas. The rapidly changing cards in the tavern stack add a neat timed/press-your-luck dimension to the game, and the restriction by color for the prisoners vs. the restrictions by color and number for the crew are an interesting mechanic I haven't encountered in other games.

RATING: 3
90% luck, 10% guesswork.  Each hand is determined by the cards you are dealt.  Forget card play...the hand never goes longer than 2 or 3 times around.  If you are dealt a few sets of high cards (e.g., three 9's and three 10's), you're screwed.  The hand will never go long enough for you to get rid of them.  You might get lucky and be able to ditch a couple during the scoring round, but not enough to save you.  I don't know what people see in this game.  It might be fun with paranoid people who wait until they are down to 4 or 5 stowaways before knocking, but most people quickly realize that the odds are pretty good that you'll do well if you if you can go out on the first round with 14 points or less, and it seems there is always one person dealt that position each hand.  Blech.

RATING: 7
Decent rummy variant with a definite hint of push your luck.  Nice balance between taking the chance of 'setting sail' (declaring) and delaying to catch others being too precipitous.  Quite the thinnest cards I've ever come across - Piatink should be ashamed.

Quick, light card game. Cards are rather thin. Nice filler.

Collect a pirate crew in any two colours (out of ten) with no duplicate numbers. Prisoners (card colour determined by face up 'Tavern' pile) don't count against you but everything else (the stowaways) does. Set sail as soon as you've got a sufficiently low score.

Even though this has similarities to gin rummy, it is still unique.  You create only one sequence with your cards.  You can use two colors to do so, but can't duplicate numbers.  You can "go out" before your entire hand is usable, gambling on the fact that you have less unused points than your opponents.  The cards of one color aren't counted against you, but this color can change throughout the game.  The cards are fragile and need to be shuffled carefully, and you need to be able to tell many different colors apart.  We play 2-player and prefer the German rules.  A fun and interesting game!

Gets old real quick.  But, it's a relatively easy game to teach to most non-gamers so it gets pulled often.  One good thing is that the set of 10 suited cards can be used for other games (last used to try Grand National).

RATING: 4
Components: Nice artwork, with colored suits that are mostly distinguishable. There seem to be a few added bits of art (a weapon per number, different faces for the 1s) that are not utilized, perhaps for an advanced version. The cards are tissue-thin, which makes them a bit difficult to handle, especially since players hold 12 cards in hand.

Experience: A simple rummy game, where players are able to collect several colors at once, according to several different criteria. The rounds go too quickly with only two players, but the game is pleasant with three; with four, too many cards are irretrievably discarded. There are very few ways in which to use a pirate, so it lacks the versatility of a traditional rummy hand, whereby players are constantly reorganizing their hands.

Similar to Gin Rummy in that you are trying to be the first to "go out" with the least negative points in your hand, but the tavern mechanism and the decisions you need to make on card/hand management make this one special.  I suspect this will end up as my favorite Colvini game of all, since it's fun to play, a quality that is often lacking in Leo's games.

Rated after 2 plays @ 4 players.

An abstract set collection game. The rules were a bit complex at the beginning and really required playing a hand or two in order to really understand how to play the game. A bit of luck is involved in terms of what cards will be seen and what colors are in your hand. Felt very much like Gin. I'd play it again with the right group but not something I would seek out.

2x 4-players game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played 2 times.

1st play - 4. 2007? - I wondered if this game would be too numbers heavy for me and if I would like it at all. Leo Colovini doing a card game sounded like a bad idea to me! I was right, it is too numbers heavy. I was wrong, Leo COlovini doing a card game was a good idea. Clever (what else would you expect) and sort of like mega-rummy with tons of things to consider when making sets according to some very tight restrictions. Still, not different enough from rummy for me to want to shell out for purchase. Clever though.

3rd play - 5. 2014 - Fun mega-rummy was as good a description as any. Nice filler too since hands are usually less than 5 minutes.

RATING: 5.5
The player whose ships carry the most stowaways loses.

I found this card game repetitive and the graphics unattractive.  There is a lot of luck in the draw.  Thankfully the conditions for winning can be modified to shorten the game.

I suppose I'll keep it to play with children.

I was thinking of rating that a 7, but since I played I find myself constantly thinking about it... Which is strange cause there seems to be some weird side-effect to this very original mechanic. Namely, it often seems profitable to wait for an opponent to set sail and the game stalls a little due to that. Still, it is so fresh and it scratches an itch rarely addressed by games: to decide if you go "all in" or not, and at which moment you should do so.

RATING: 8
A good rummy style card game with a pirate theme. Try to be the first to build the best prisoner/crew/stowaway combination and set sail. It seems it can also be advantageous to build up and wait for someone else to set sail so you can dump a few more cards to their crew. This only works well if you build to the tavern well. If the sailer changes the tavern and sails immediately you can get stuck.

RATING: 2
After second playing my rating sank into the abyss.  Although there are some decisions, most are very obvious.  There is very little possibility of recovering from a bad deal.  Relatedly, if you happen to have a good deal, there's no reason not to go out as soon as possible.  Thus, hands tend to last only 2, maybe 3, rounds, screwing anyone with a lot of different colors from the deal.  After four hands, I'd had enough, and dropped out.  I might give this one last chance, but I'd never choose it.  Multiplayer rummy with extra suck.

I have now learned that the RGG rules are quite different from the original German rules.  I'm not convinced that they would greatly improve the game, but I would give it one last chance with the original rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Overall, a pretty fun game.  My one complaint is that the colors can be a bit hard to distinguish, and the icons match the number, not the suit, and is located in such a way that they are useless anyway.  The character drawings are fun.

RATING: 4
Average game of collecting sets.  People whine too much about the quality of the cards.  The quality is fine, in fact, I like how the cards are a bit thinner so you can actually shuffle the big deck.  Still, not much to recommend it.

"Corsari"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Colovini designs simple, clean games in the light and middleweight categories.  Corsari is definitely on the lightweight end of his range.  It's a riff on gin rummy that teaches you to fear your opponents' hands, pay attention to their draws and discards, and sniff out the proper time to make your move.  Compared with gin rummy, Corsari is a faster game, and it presents players with more interesting decisions while managing to keep things very simple.  Three players gives a richer game experience than two players because you have to consider the positions of two opponents.  Four players is starting to push it, though, and I'd choose something else with that number.

Played 2+ 3&5 players 30 mins. Once we downloaded the correct rules this game worked fine. The cards are nicely illustrated. For me the rules need a well written paragraph linking the game mechanics to the theme, then perhaps the play would come more instinctively. July 05

I played this a few years ago and it was totally forgettable.  I picked it up more recently on a lark/impulse from Lanterna Magica, run by one of the designers of War of the Ring.

My preferred version is "Corsari," thought the artwork is goofy and the color coding isn't entirely easy to see. 

Fun set collecting game in the Rummy neighborhood.  Players collect different cards of (eleven) varying values and (six?) colors in an attempt to "go out" (called setting sail) with the lowest possible score.  As with most of Leo's games, theme is irrevelant to the abstraction of the game.  Took a hand or two to truly understand when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em, but once you do it's quick and tense - knowing when to go out by mitigating your point total is key.  Also point swings are potentially huge in the game so it tends to keep everyone in the game.  Not my favorite, but one I'd play if it hit the table.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For two players, it plays a little fast and with lots of luck. The cards could be thicker, and the brown and gray cards are hard to distinguish, but it's a fine game. We tried a two person variant that you must set sail with a crew of 8 or more.

RATING: 4
[Initial Impression: 4] An uninspiring rummy-like card game. Pick a card, discard a card...repeat until someone decides to "set sail." This is done by forming a "crew" set consisting of unique numbers in two colors, and a "prisoner" set that matches the top card in a face up stack ("the tavern") - leftover cards count as points equal to the numbers on the cards. All other players can then form their own crews and prisoner sets, but can also play on the crew of the person who "set sail". Bonuses are awarded, then repeat the cycle until a point threshold is met. Pretty standard and uninvolving from my point of view.

RATING: 7
1st played 01/30/08. Taught in ~5min, played in ~15min for 4 players. Aggressive/risk-taking groups can hammer through this fast. Game has some strategy, however luck tips scales. The deck consists of 10 color suits w/ cards #'ed 1-11. Each player is dealt 12 cards (4 player). 9 cards are placed face-up on top of each other (showing the color/number of each) as the "tavern". Finally one card is placed in the discard pile w/ the rest as the draw pile. Goal: get as many cards in your Ship (hand) that makes a run of cards 1-11 (in 2 suits, w/ #'s being distinct) while minimizing your "stowaways" (SAs; cards that aren't part of your "ship"). Cards matching top most tavern card suit are sent to the tavern & aren't SAs. Turn: 1) Take top most card from draw deck, discard, or tavern. 2) Discard (even drawn card). 3) Decide if you shall sail & become captain. Cards missing in captain's ship can be discarded by others, however only one 5 if they happen to have both 5's. SAs # values are totaled & if captain has lowest, captain discards SAs. If any player has value lower, the captain takes on their SAs. Game is over once you have 35 SAs (cards not # total) & the player w/ least SAs wins. Great filler & game to consider as filler purchase.

You try to collect two suits, but with no matching numbers. Then lower the value of your remaining cards and go out. There is also a third suit that can change which won't count against you. You are penalyzed if you go out with a higher value than the other players. There is luck in getting the right suits and knowing when to go out is tricky.

Ridiculous theme that is the epitome of pasted on, and easily the cheapest cardstock I've ever seen.

My main concern is that a player could easily win or lose a hand without ever having done anything or taken a turn.  This happened in our first game.  My hand seemed reasonable, so I just ended the round, which must have been frustrating for my opponents (though honestly, kind of fun for me).

It's ultimately kind of a game of chicken, and when treated that way, with table talk and bluffing, it's actually kind of fun, as long as no one takes it too seriously.

"So, are you in the single digits yet?"

"Oh yeah, I was in single digits two turns ago!"

While I almost want to knock down the rating of this game due to the horrendous card stock on which this card game is printed, the game play is enjoyable and fairly straight forward.  Draw a card, discard a card, decide if you will set sail.  In the game, you seek to have the least amount of stowaways (I prefer the original German rules).  There are three different piles from which you may draw a card with one effecting what color can be thrown away for free by everyone as prisoners.  Otherwise, you are basically trying to collect in two colors one card each from 1-11.  The other cards are generally going to be stowaways.

A good game that deserves a better rules translation. Do you 'sum the stowaway cards' or do you [sum the values of the stow away cards] ? The rules intend the latter, but say the former. We need an English speaker to translate the rules to these games - it's getting worser and worser and worser, year after year, phoning in the xlats to this stuff. Throw these garbage rules in the garbage and download the 'proper' xlat from the geek. (note: the proper xlat includes mention of the '35 stowaways' to end the game.)

Question on scoring.  Now the game is not in front of me, but do you get positive points for the prisoners (those that match the tavern), and if so is it the value on the card or number of cards?. Then everyone sets down their sets and puts any "stowaway" cards they have into my crew if appropriate.  Then here's where I get hazy, each person's stowaway group is tallied by value and compared with the lowest goup then going to and here I'm not clear the next lowest and on up to where the largest gets them all?  If people tie at the next to highest should it be broken by quantity vs quality or both get the scorces?  Again the rules are not in front at the moment but caused some confusion in our play.

Corsari is new-to-me and quite a good game, actually [although the "original German rules" referenced in the forum sound absolutely atrocious], being a very fast-playing rummy game with quite a few interesting twists. It's a rummy game where you're building up a meld, but then the hand ends as soon as you decide to lay down. Everyone else lays down [and lays off on your meld] the best they can, and scores for their deadweight.

The funny twist comes in in that if you're the one to meld and anyone else has less deadweight than you, you get a massive penalty, so you have to time your meld with an eye to your opponent's hand strength. This is made even more interesting in the very specific ways you can meld. You don't make "sets" or "runs" as such; instead, of the 10 colors in the deck you can only count 2 toward your meld, and between those 2 colors you can only count a maximum of one each of the 11 ranks.

The real kicker is that there's a shared third color that you can also count toward your meld [with any combination of ranks], but that it can change from round to round. You can see the changes coming [they're face-up in a pool] and make some very interesting strategy around it. You can hold dangerous high-rank cards in that shared color [discarding completely off-suit deadweight first], but if someone else changes it on you, you're suddenly stuck with an awful lot of added deadweight. You have to manage all of these contingencies while building your hand.

The bit about everyone who didn't meld getting to lay off on the melder's hand adds even more tension, as you need to make sure you have as many of the 11 ranks represented so that someone doesn't get a huge boon being able to lay off up to 4 or 5 of the colors in their hand. The game plays unexpectedly fast, because you don't have the typical rummy-family aggravation of needing to keep drawing to get that "one last card" that will complete your meld. Nobody has to finish their hand, which means that the hand can literally end anytime.

Deck consists of 10 suits, numbered 1 through 11; players are dealt 12 cards.

Sort of an advanced Knock-Rummy variant that's loads of fun. The card stock is pretty flimsy, but seems stronger than it appears as after a couple of games, the cards are still in the same shape as when we started. As stated elsewhere, this thin stock DOES make shuffling much easier. I also applaud the color choices (for the most part) - 10 different colors and only two are somewhat hard to differentiate. There still is no reason that each color couldn't have had a distinguishing symbol - come on developers and publishers... not only do a fair percentage of your customers suffer from color-blindness of some kind, but many times the lighting isn't perfect and even those with perfect eyesight will have to struggle to tell one color from another!

RATING: 4.5
Plays like a traditional card game so it's very non-gamer friendly.  I play it with my father and other relatives quite a lot but it's not a game I'd bring out to my boardgame club.  It's very dry and difficult for color-blind people, when even regular people sometimes mistake one of the dark colors for another one (violet,brown, navy blue, black).  I don't play it the original way of player elimination since I feel it would overstay its welcome, so once one player reaches 100 pts (which is bad, lowest score wins), the game ends and the more astute or luckier gamer prevails.

Played two games, 3 and 4 players. Nice set collection card game. Every player can choose 2 colors to collect and there is always one common color - that can be predicted and changed. Your trying to end round with minimum points possible but person trying to end round is at a little disadvantage. Some cards used during round are kept for scoring so deck isn't static during game.

We now play with the variant that you must meld one colour on a turn prior to sailing off. That warning makes it a tad more dangerous to do an early sail, turning most hands into a rummy-esque process. The tavern cards provide a nice "strategic" element to each hand. The game is enjoyed as a light, late night closer.

RATING: 6
This game might rate higher if playing with more, I have only played with 2.  I did enjoy it, but quickly found that with 2 you can set sail basically right away if you have even a half decent hand, and get (and frustrate) your opponent everytime.  Does have good strategy, just doesn't scale to two.

This is basically Gin Rummy with a bunch of extra rules.  Basically, you're trying to end up with a hand with as few points as possible.  You can "go out" whenever you'd like, allowing you to have some say as to which suits won't cost points.  However, your opponents get additional suits that won't cost.  So, you have to balance going out quickly before others are set up with the extra advantages not going out give you.  Interesting, but the rules are a little confusing for something of this ilk.

OWN Mar/08 (kids): Seems ok, but can run long.  To me, there is insufficient reward for 'setting sail' and having the best crew, versus the penalty for setting sail with inferior shipmates.  This is especially true since you have limited control, as the cards in your hand were largely dealt out versus drafted.  ie. too much luck of the deal.

The game uses a mechanic similar to Gin Rummy. It is a deeper card game and should appeal to players who enjoy Gang of Four. The game is intense as you never know when someone will sail (go out). I suppose the pirate theme is due to the popularity of Pirates of the Caribbean; it could have been anything. The only drawback to the game is that the cards are thin and bend easily.

Corsari (Scoring is different than described above): Quick and engaging card game that just might be a bit too quick. Have yet to have a loss by reaching the 101 score, all games have been decided by someone finishing 'clean'. Maybe 101 should be reduced to 51? Difficult to explain to non-English speakers.

Very good game that has a number of interesting decisions. Rating just went up 3! points.

A good small game not too complicated that you can play with a coffee in the morning with your girlfriend. A lot of luck involved (like in all colovini's games) but there is still a certain part of strategy that makes the game interresting. Easy rules very clear in English but not that clear in French. The cards are a little bit thin. What am I saying, more paper like. you probably will want to protect them.
P.S. My girlfriend love that game so it's a keeper.

Un bon petit jeu pas trÃ¨s compliquÃ© que vous pouvez jouer le matin avec votre conjointe et un cafÃ©. Le jeu comporte une bonne part de chance (comme dans tous les jeux de colovini) mais il y a toujours une part de stratÃ©gie qui rend le jeu intÃ©ressant. Les rÃ¨gles sont claires pour la version Anglaise mais pas trÃ¨s claires en FranÃ§ais. Les cartes sont minces comme une feuille de papier. Vous voudrez surement les protÃ©ger.
P.S. ma conjointe aime bien ce jeu ce qui est gagnant.

Nice little idea. Card quality is terrible. It's good to have a light card game around that isn't the usual trick taking genre. This is one of those games. I'm always confused when I play this after a long break. It doesn't seem intuitive to me and that's one of the things I like about it.

This card game has some of the most non-intuitive scoring you can imagine.  The first hand I played - I was playing by a scoring system that made much better sense and the other players agreed would have been an improvement over what is there.

Corsari -- Played once; four-player.  I don't quite know how to rate this.  I really like several mechanics (for example: having two colors on your ship, but no duplicate numbers; and the Gargon-style display of cards which will determine an invalid suit), but I found the actual play didn't afford enough control to the players -- perhaps due to the high number of suits (ten!).  I want to like it more, but Corsari will not be joining our game collection.

:thumbsup: LIKE
+ While the theme of Corsari is thin but relevant, I think the abstraction of the I Go! version is interesting
+ Simple Rummy gameplay (draw and discard), but with some level of thinking; how to form your crew, tavern card, what to discard, etc
+ Rush to set sail! Be the first or score better than the player who did

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- For a Rummy variant, how the crew works and is scored is a bit rough on neophyte. I suggest a learning turn for those players
- Card colours! Not to be played in a dimly light environment as lots of colours overlap (even with good lighting!). I Go! version is much better in this regard
- Luck of shuffle and draw; there's only so much you can do with open cards.
- Card quality of Corsari leaves a lot to be desired.

:star: VERDICT
It's a classic card filler in my heart. You never can go wrong with a Colovini design.

This comment reviews the Corsari edition, not having played the I Go! edition:  Very interesting hand management choices in this peculiar rummy game.  After several plays with simply a set number of deals, we got around to following the rulebook on playing until one player is eliminated, then the others continuing the game.  Until I tried it, I didn't see why it would work so well, but it was perfect for this game.  And by the way, the thinner than usual cards were a smart production design choice for facilitating shuffling of the 110-card deck.

Corsari is a fun, fast card game with undertones of knock rummy.

As far as theme goes,  this one barely qualifies as pasted on - it more likely resembles the utilization of some slightly yellowed scotch tape.  Not that it matters much here - and I have no compunctions with the decision to go with pirates. 

It is simply a color matching game - whereby you are attempting to collect two sets out of the available ten colors - with no duplicate numbers among them.  This allows you to set sail - or go out - with the intent of having the lowest total among your other "off" cards.

This is a simplified description,  but it's not a whole lot deeper than a traditional card game.  That doesn't mean to imply there is little choice here - I think the decisions are ample.....and at the end of the day,   Corsari turns out to be a relaxing,   pleasant and engaging filler.

Very good rummy variant, I think it is better with the German (Colovini's?) scoring rules. I like the Rio Grande rules fine, but the German rules are much more...elegant. As an added plus, you don't need paper and pencil to keep score, because the cards you keep are your score. Jay, tell us: why are the RGG scoring rules SO different?

This is a twisty little Rummy game, which has some interesting elements to it.  There's no small amount of chaos, based on the Tavern and the way players can manipulate it, but some amount of planning ahead can alleviate some of it.

A super-light card game with a "press your luck" type mechanic.  There are a few problems here though.  Scoring swings are a little too wild to make it a very competitive game in most cases.  Also, the colors used printing the cards were poorly chosen -- it's often difficult to tell the (dark) brown, (dark) gray, and (dark) blue cards apart in dim lighting.  And forget about this one if you're colorblind.

After looking through the forum here, it seems that RGG changed the rules to the game, so I'll have to play by the original rules to see what I prefer.  As it is, I like it as a two player game, would like to try with more players.

This one is a hit with us for some strange reason, though I wasn't expecting it to be so.  Maybe it's because I'm anal and I enjoy sorting and organizing, which is what you do a lot of in this game (as with any game in the rummy family).  Maybe it's because my husband had the perfect hand and set sail without any stowaways and I still want to best him.  Yes, the cards are thin but there are a lot of them.  Whoever mentioned card sleeves has a good idea.  Or buy another deck, they're cheap enough.

Excellent 2-4 player game that is a good time-waster.  Light enough for my wife or any non-gamer, but still offers enough to keep more hardcore gamers' attention.

Surprisingly strategic little card game.  Probably one that could be introduced to non-gamers since it is similar to gin.

Not bad as a rummy variant, but there are simply too many suits (10) to track at once. With a hand of 12 cards, that's a lot of cards to manage and sift through while trying to pare down your hand to only 3 of the 10 suits. If played again, I'd probably ditch 1 or 2 suits when playing with only 3 players.

Quite a fun card game!  Reminds me a lot of Gin Rummy, but the tavern opens up a ton of tactical possibilities.  Also, it's fun to agonize whether or not to "set sail", wondering if you have few enough stowaways.  High risk can give high rewards.  Seems like it's broken with 4; just don't ever set sail and screw over whoever does!

Recently upped the rating to 8.  There's something to be said about a game I continue to request to play yet haven't won. Cardstock quality isn't great but the game is worth it on many levels.

Straight forward set collecting game with a slight difference. I think its Ok and will play, my teenage daughter thinks the game is broken and is rubbish - she doesnt see why anyone would ever set sail first - so she doesnt.

La baraja del juego estÃ¡ formada por cartas de pirata numeradas del 1 al 11 en 10 colores. Cada ronda los jugadores intentan reclutar la mejor tripulaciÃ³n (mÃ¡ximo 2 colores) evitando la presencia de polizones.

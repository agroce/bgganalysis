I never thought I'd ever rate a game lower than Crokinole but even watching other people play this is so painful, I felt bad for everyone stuck at that table while I was playing something fun. Boring, unnecessarily confusing, nit-picky, repetitive, predictable, and did I mention boring? Worth another chance if and only if me playing the game will somehow reverse global warming or end childhood hunger.

After playing this a number of times, it is not for me. It gets high marks for the theme and the awesome components, but the gameplay itself is the most random I have ever experienced outside of the kid board games I played growing up. If it was a guaranteed 30 minute game, that would be one thing, but there is way too much dice rolling to spend two hours (or longer!) just to fill up the cheese wheel right before the game ends. Ugh. I don't expect to ever play this again.

I love the theme of this game, but think some of the story elements could have been written/handled better. Very enjoyable and has a 'HeroQuest' feel to it.

It is rated ages 7+, but I think that is more on theme. Younger kids will definitely enjoy it, but I think an adult or experienced child would need to be included in the mix because of the amount of rules in some portions of the game.

This game is rich and vivid in theme, and really takes the dungeon crawl and makes it fantastic.  Instead of orcs and goblins, you fight rats and centipedes.  You're mice, after all!  The storytelling part is cute, but not absolutely necessary for a good playthrough.

RATING: 6
A moderately fun dungeon-crawler with a fabulous setting. Components are nice and miniatures are great. The rules are refreshingly simple - it doesn't try to do anything particularly clever and is very intuitive as a result, but the AI is predictable and gameplay can be a little drab.

RATING: 8
If you like anthropomorphic heroes rescuing a withering king from an obligatory evil step mother, then this game will have you squeaking with joy. Mice and Mystics was my first dungeon crawl, and I feel like the theme may have blinded me somewhat to the simplified encounter mechanics. With the accompanying narrative it is an easy to get swept up in the game, and one I look forward to playing with my kids when they are older.

RATING: 5.5
Gameplay is just decent. Feels like they had a reasonably good story, but ruined it by slapping on a bunch of poorly thought out mechanics. Campaign structure is really lazy and unimaginative. Would much rather play Descent or D&D. Really leaning towards trading this one away.

For an RPG board game, I can't imagine anything better. This game is easy, highly thematic and wonderfully fun. The scenarios are exceedingly fresh and exciting. There are many surprises to find in the abilities and search cards. Combat is breezy fun - exciting without being drawn out or too brutal. All actions are natural and straight forward - without being overly simplistic. Over all, I love this one.

RATING: 7
This game is entertaining, but still has a few problems. The combat is pretty fair and the story is nice, but the rules can be unclear about many things. Add on the fact that some heroes are clearly more powerful than others and the fact that two-player mode has each player keeping track of two characters can bog you down even more. The campaign book is interesting and has nice thematic flavor, but it often reuses certain tiles so much that you will often fight with yourself not to skip a few levels to get to the tiles you haven't played on yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good and cute game.  Definitely for all ages.  It's a very basic dungeon crawler that is themed to something that even kids will like.  The story is played out as if you are taking part in a story book.  Only downside is that some rules are confusing or unfair, so it is recommended that you play with some houserules in certain areas.

RATING: 7
My favorite dungeon crawl as it doesn't have the one vs many confrontational element that Descent does.  However this can be a liability as it is tough to 'ease up' when playing with my youngest son.

Edit: Now that I've played the game a few more times, a seven rating definitely seems about right.  My youngest son loves this game, the story elements are fun and the theme is just right.  So game time with the family, that's a win!  However my oldest son has really cooled on the game and doesn't play anymore.  He wants more choices tactically and this game really just boils down to a slugfest.  As the mice have leveled up I think there are some interesting choices with skills (Tilda's Fortify, Maginos' Chain Lightning, Colin's Inspire), so I guess I'm saying I don't completely agree with my son, but I understand his point of view.  There's games out there with better advancement and more variety of maps/monsters/heroes, but they're longer (not good for a young child) and a key point here is they gloss over the story.

I'm very happy I bought this game, it has already provided many hours of entertainment and I'm only halfway through the base game's story.

Fun story.  Fun characters.  Fun light leveling up and customization.  The voice work on the site is a nice addition.


I wish the the gaps between chapters was more filled out.

It may be because my group tried to play everything a short period of time but the overall game play started to drag a little.  so we ended up just playing a few random encounters, skipping the rest, and then focusing on the story bits.


I do like that each chapter had a little something that modified it.

This was pitched to me as a light dnd game with amazing components and story. The components and story are amazing, but coming in new to the game and playing with new players the game quickly dismantled into a rulebook read-fest and we weren't able to get through the first quest.

I still really like the game and will definitely work through the campaign, but the number of rules I think put it more on par with medium-weight RPGs. Make sure to read the rulebook, watch a video tutorial, and then a video play through before starting this with a fresh group.

Would be great to have this and the promos-add ons.  I believe it would be a family favorite. Seen it at my FLGS recently and some strange reason, I left it on the shelf. Darn it. Daughter will love this one for sure-the theme alone will make it a top 3 unless she starts thinking about the time out at a cost berry home she took her shoe off, walked inside to grab something 3 feet from the door, immediately returned to slip on her shoe. The face she made and scream that escaped her beautiful but tormented face is one I'll never forget.  She pulled her foot back out of the boot and screamed again as she dumped out a rather small mouse. 

Lesson I had been trying to teach for years finally set in for all the kids. Do NOT leave shoes outside and not expect a critter to call them home. They're shelter enough for our feet, so a mansion for those who can't build quite like humans can. Thank you, Little Mouse for not biting her and for giving your life to ensure a rattlesnake won't be stepped on in the future.

Game looks beautiful but... it's a children's game.
For adults, mechanics are very repetitive and boring. After three chapters, even my wife, which is new to tabletop game and love the artistic part of this, thinks that it's become painful to play.

I wanted to love this so so much. I painted up all the wonderful models before I played it and got so very excited about getting it to the table. Yes it's adorable and very rich in backstory, but the gameplay is just not there. Very few tiles have enough obstacles that prevent you from reaching any enemy, so the entire game feels like throwing dice until you win, or until the game just fizzles out and you have to start again.

Not enough decision making, not enough strategy. Roll the dice, hope for the best and enjoy the story.

Probably the worst board game I've played during all my life. My criticism is not about the mechanics, the build quality or the art, but the useless rules book and the bad design decisions, flaws and gaps found all around that make this game a pain in the ass not only to learn but specially to play with. Even worse the game is not ready to be played as it requires a few extra elements/components to properly deal with the rules and keep control of activities during the gameplay. It is not a cheap game and therefore its flaws are hard to swallow.

I bought this game to expand my collection genres. It satisfies the "dungeon crawl" niche but I feel that this game should be on a computer to handle all of the stats, movements, test rolls, and attach/defense rolls. (i.e. this is a computer game in board format).

RATING: 6
Συνεργατικό dungeon crawler παιχνίδι με όμορφες μινιατούρες και ενδιαφέρον θέμα. Το παιχνίδι στηρίζεται πολύ στο έντονο θέμα του το οποίο και υποστηρίζει με όμορφες ιστορίες κατά την διάρκεια της campaign. Μιλάμε για σελίδες κείμενο. Οι μηχανισμοί είναι πολύ απλοί και υπάρχει μπόλικο ζάρι κυρίως στις μάχες αλλά και λίγο στη κίνηση των χαρακτήρων. Το αποτέλεσμα είναι λίγες τακτικές αποφάσεις για τους παίκτες.

Οι εχθροί κινούνται από μόνοι τους με συγκεκριμένη λογική. Οι melee εχθροί πάνε και βαράνε τον πλησιέστερο ήρωα ενώ οι ranged εχθροί βαράνε από μακριά. Θα ήθελα μεγαλύτερη ποικιλία εδώ. Υπάρχει πληθώρα από equipments αλλά και skills που μπορείς να μάθεις κάνοντας level-up. To παιχνίδι χρησιμοποιεί το τυρί σαν mana για τα skills και σαν XP για level up. Διαλέγεις πως θα το χρησιμοποιήσεις.

Πολύ όμορφο και παραμυθένιο το artwork και γενικότερα τα components. Το Story είναι που κρατάει το ενδιαφέρον σου κατά την διάρκεια της campaign. Θα ήθελα να είχε πιο πολλές τακτικές επιλογές. Επίσης οι 2 πρώτες αποστολές μας φάνηκαν πολύ εύκολες. Ελπίζω να δυσκολεύει μετά γιατί ως γνωστόν συνεργατικό και εύκολο καταντά βαρετό γρήγορα.

Το παιχνίδι δείχνει να απευθύνεται περισσότερο σε οικογένειες με παιδιά, χωρίς αυτό να σημαίνει πως δεν μπορούν να το απολαύσουν και καμένοι gamers.

Rating based on 1 play:

I liked it.  Initially it took us quite a while to get into the rules - lost of flicking back and forwards and loads of questions that needed clarifying.

What I did love was the artwork - gorgeous.  Them theme is certainly more family friendly than a dungeon crawl.  The minis are lovely but I;d really love to see more variety in the types of baddies (I presume more will follow in expansions).  

Combat is as simple as can be - lovely.  Most actions and moves are intuitive.  The chapter progression is handled incredibly well, changing initiative was clever and the cheese, being both good and bad is an inspired mechanism that both progresses the story progression and is used for character development.

Once we got past the rule clarifications and into the game, the turns flew by and just when we thought the game was too easy, things ramped-up.  Initially, we concentrated more on gameplay and ignored the story to an extent, but I'm keen to reveal it further and to play again.

Positive: It is easy enough to play with non-gamers and/or children.
Negative: It is about as interesting as a game that is easy enough to play with non-gamers and/or children can be.

Positive: Nice miniatures.
Negative: Nice miniatures--at the expense of having interesting game play.

EDIT; Now that I have played other dungeon crawlers and have something to actually compare this game to, it's actually quite charming.  The gameplay is very smooth and intuitive, and the rules are surprising uncomplicated.  The story line is a bit silly (though to be honest, all dungeon crawl storylines are silly--that's what makes them fun).  I actually appreciate the consistency of the storytelling--here you will find no random mashup of Tolkein, Greco-Roman Mythology, Norse Mythology, Christian supernatural beings, and generic D and D shenanigans. 

All in all, this turned out to be one of my favorite guilty-pleasures to play solo.  But it is easy enough that I can teach it to gamers and non-gamers alike.

My favorite co-operative dungeon crawl, with a fantastic theme.  Better story than those so far published for Descent.  Something about this game just warms my heart, and the mechanics are so simple and easy.  Too easy? Maybe.

A highly enjoyable game that combines the pleasure of being told a story with the joys of boardgaming, with a whiff of roleplaying flavour on the side. Over the cuteness factor of the mice you must not overlook that this is one really tough game! You need all your wits to get through the session victorious, but you will not come out unscathed. (It is more than enough to give you some serious nightmares over the welfare of your pet mouse.)

Interesting and easy RPG-ish game. Fairly simple in its execution; a lot of the difficulty comes from the sheer randomness of the cards and dice. Unfortunately, the mice have too few hit points and can get slaughtered very quickly; dice can make or break the game very quickly. Didn't play the game enough for us to justify keeping it; it would be so long between plays that we'd forget the campaign and the rules, have to relearn and restart the game, only to get a chapter or two in, grow tired of it, and start the entire cycle all over again several months later. Sold to make room for other games.

We love this game. A dungeon crawl with a good theme and a delightful story to back it up. The miniatures in this game were so cool it inspired my wife to take up the hobby of painting minis. Some of the rules can become a bit fiddly and bog down the game play but those incidents are few and far between. The biggest problem we have with it is that "cheese wheel." It can fill up so fast thanks to enemies rolling cheese that we've had to house rule that after each board (both sides) are completed we clear the cheese wheel otherwise we never finish. I'm sure some of you will cry foul but this is the only game we own where we are enjoying playing through the story more than the actual game play.

RATING: 6
This is one of my favorite games to play with my wife. It's a beautifully made game with quality miniatures to start off and hits all the marks for games we enjoy together. It's theme is light but not silly and it plays like a heavier RP game with less work (pre-created characters/bosses). It plays cooperatively but still encourages individual decisions regarding the advancement of your characters.

If I was to point out a negative I would really focus on the rule book. It's poorly written with many items I feel should be grouped under 1 heading spread throughout the 20 ish pages. 

My worry is post story play replay-ability.

Juego muy chulo para jugar en cualquier momento, pero es importante jugar continuadamente(incluso recurriendo a jugar forever alone) para no perder el hilo de la historia. La historia es lo principal del juego y lo más chulo. Si le quitas eso, es un dungueon normalito tiradados. Pero el juego me encanta

A convention might not be the best place to play Mice & Mystics, but I wanted to try it to see if it would be something my wife might like. After playing through the intro campaign mission I'm still not sure, but I'm leaning towards yes. It was surprisingly difficult; as I expected a game more geared towards families. We barely made it to the kitchen before we were defeated by a huge spider that came out of a surge. The rulebook was a little tough to get through in a convention atmosphere, but it they had some helpful videos online. I loved the theme and I think where it would really shine is playing the game all the way through and really getting a feel for the characters. I think it might be a really good intro game to the dungeon crawl genre. I will probably pick up a copy.

Great idea for theme. Awesome miniatures. Pretty good rules. Loads of fun, especially for a family group, or those who enjoy story/narative. Way less for non-themers and eurogamers. Way less fun WITH them as well.

What can I say? I'm a sucker for the story, which is well-written, tense, fun and surprising. I'm generally not a fan of this type of dice-rolling, move around the board game system (which feels pretty typical), but the story makes the game for me. I'm invested in the characters, so winning / losing a "chapter" feels particularly meaningful.

I want to like this game so much.  It wants to be Redwall - the board game.  The theme and the production of the game are top notch.  But somehow the game struggles to rise to expectations.  The first issue I have is that its a tad fiddly.  There are cards for this and that and those and getting it set up seems to take a long time.  The rules - while well written - seem to find a way of being forgotten between sessions.  When do I add cheese to the clock?  What does it take to get out of the water?  Isn't there something special about that darn Brodie?  These could be dismissed as not having focused and knowledgeable gamers playing.  But I think the biggest drawback to this game is that it is so wickedly hard!  Perhaps we've just always gotten the rules somehow wrong.  Or we are bad at setting up characters, or have really bad luck... but winning even the first scenario has proven ard enough that multiple attempts have ended in TPKs (total party kills).  That shouldn't happen in the 1st scenario.  That's just too discouraging for younger family members that really, really want to like the game too.

Still seeking a story game that really has both sides of the coin represented. This story is so charming and clever, I would likely have just read it as a book.

Still, worth a look.

As a game to play with kids there is a lot going for Mice and Mystics.  It's full of great art, cool minis, and whimsical style. 

As a game to play with adults it's a fairly straight forward dungeon crawler and tactical minis game in the mold of Descent.  

The setting and story is enough to suck you in for a while but the game itself fails to hold my attention.

Egy nagyon jó hangulatú játék lenne, talán csak az első parti szokásos kis félreértései miatt nem volt átütő élmény. Egyébként szerintem egy egyszerűsített, kevésbé sötét Odalent-szerűség, ami így családibb játék is annál. A pályaépítés egyszerű, az alapmechanizmusok is pofonegyszerűek (támadás, mozgás), kevés fajta akció van, és szinte mindig egyértelmű, hogy mit kell csinálni (ha van mód támadásra akkor szinte mindig azt kell tenni), de azért mint az ilyen jellegű játékoknál általában, itt is megtaláljuk a sok kivételt. Emellett sajnos néhány szabály azért nem volt egyértelmű, pl. a patkányok és csótányok esetében az életszám megtévesztően van jelölve... A keresés paklit kicsit haszontalannak éreztem, a sajtozás jó ötlet és tematikus. Jó ötlet az összetűzés sorrend is, és hogy bizonyos képességek ehhez kapcsolódnak (pl. patkányoknál, Filchnél). A történettábla is nagyon tetszik. És a játék közbeni sztori mesélés is, bár ez alapból nem áll hozzám közel, de rásegít a hangulatra.
Összességében egy hangulatos jó kis kooperatív kalandjáték, helyenként nem túl egzakt szabállyal, és határesetként akár kisebb gyerekekkel is játszható, bár felnőtteknek se könnyű.

Dungeon crawler to play with the children - though the length of each scenario (usually 2 hours) can become a bit of a trial if taken in one sitting. As an adult, it's easy to appreciate the novelty and the innovation involved in the scenarios - though initially I found the pure volume of different rules difficult to get on top of. Not sure that we'd ever play it through again once we have finished the campaign, but it is undoubtedly a quality product. Rating based only on ability to play with the children - I don't think it is one that I could bring myself to play with other adults!

Mice and Mystics is a fairly typical dungeon crawler, with surprisingly easy rules (I can't wait to play it with my daughters when they grow up) and a fresh theme, very similar to Mouse Guard graphic novel.
The better part of the game lies in the story: the game is designed to be played as a campaign by the same group of players, and there's plenty of stuff to read aloud to live a great experience together.
The slightly disappointing part is the decision making: you move and do things (or vice versa) and everything is pretty simple to figure out. It is family and non-gamer friendly, but I hope that future scenarios are a little more challenging.
Anyway, I'd recommend it for groups who want to live the adventure, especially if they include kids!

Initial Impression: This is a family friendly dungeon crawler game. The theme and story are instantly compelling and the rules are easy to grasp. The game flows really well after the initial few turns. The characters come alive with retained skills, equipment, and background story. The minis scream to be painted. I'm hoping to see many more expansions to the game in the near future. 

10 Plays: My son and I are enjoying the game together. He's been interested in the character progression and I've been hooked on the story. We've already agreed to buy and play all the forseeable expansions. Although the gameplay is light, we actually find that a positive in that the rules don't get in the way of the great narrative. I've painted the minis and created a custom insert to make setup/breakdown alot quicker.

20 Plays: My son and I stalled at the beginning of Chapter 8 and I eventually lost him to the lure of video games. As such, I've restarted the story from the beginning. As it had been almost a year since our last session, I'm rediscovering the magic of the story (yeah, my memory is terrible). This time I've purposely chosen characters in order to create an odd mix of personalities/abilities in order to crank up the difficulty and I have to say that it's been working. For myself, this is an enjoyable game even the second time around.

40 Plays: After watching me struggle through some of the later chapters, my son was once again drawn into the story and helped me complete the adventure. The final chapters are VERY interesting and I highly recommend sticking it out through to the end of the story. The character progression is wonderful and we truly enjoyed the story. Although I'll be jumping into Heart of Glorm by myself, my son has asked me to let him know when we can tackle Downwood Tales together.

I played this with my gaming group as out gateway dungeon crawl. The swingy and unmitigateable luck of the D6 eventually shelved it for us. Now, I play with my 5 & 8 year old boys, and'd it's almost perfect. There is enough theme, planning, and game for a gamer, and enough dice chuckery for the kids. 8 year old is all over it and could  play on his own, 5 year old just likes killin roaches and searching! I enjoy that they are learning logic and that games don't all require a power source, and it provides for excellent family time. I look forward to playing through the entire series to date with them in the near future.

I don't know that I am patient enough to enjoy all that the story component of this game has to offer, but as far as the mechanics are concerned, this is a top notch dungeon crawl with a very heart warming theme. Because if the back story, I do feel like I care about the heroes. And there is real purpose behind defeating the enemy units, other than reaching my goal. After playing the first chapter, I am convinced that this game has potential. Especially as my youngest kids get older. I have started considering an arena variant. It would still be co-op, but against mob after mob of enemy units in a single room tile.

Wonderful game, after you play several times to familiarize with the rules. I've seen several play-throughs online, and in each video a rule is misinterpreted. Early on I spent more time with the game site FAQ than I did playing, and still played incorrectly the first several tries. So, in the end this is a tough recommendation because it can be such a frustrating experience. However, the game truly immerses you in the world Jerry Hawthorne has created. And for that I keep coming back. Victories, though few and far between, are sweet and memorable. Unfortunately, I'm forced to play solo because my family gave up on it long ago.

This was suprisingly fun.  It's got a super charming theme, great atmospheric atrwork and a solid game mechanic.  It's not ground breaking, but it doesn't need to be.  There are dice, there are cards, there is a narrative, there are dungeon tiles and there is a clock.  It is an exercise in creating a game that takes solid game elements and interlaces them together very nicely.  I will conceed that the strongest point of the game is it's theme, however, since I'm a lover of Ameritrash, this works just fine for me.

I love the idea of this game.  Playing a game that is part of a story is a lot if fun.  It is not a game you play for the challenge.  The number of decisions you make are fairly limited and usually obvious.  That's not to say the game is easy though - we got trounced on our first two attempts through the first chapter.  My only complaint is that character/minion movement kind of stinks - most of the time you can get most of the way across the tile in a single turn.  It doesn't allow for much strategy in terms of positioning, and all of the mice/minions tend to end up in a clump.  But really the reason we play this game is for the story, and that part is great.

RATING: 5
I liked the effort they put into making it a story game, but the tactical side of the game wasn't engaging to me. It felt too easy to be a tactical board game, but it wasn't light enough for my non-gaming friends to jump in with minimal rules.

Dungeon Crawler where you play as a group of enchanted mice.

Tiptoe through the castle's chambers or scurry through the tunnels beneath the ancient stone walls.
Fight off evil rat-guardsmen, creepy spiders, small roaches or giant centipedes to discover the secret of the malicious Vanestra. 

Choose between the usual archetypes: Such as warrior, archer, mage, healer or rogue and set up a group of adventurer for each session.
Your party fights through eleven colorful illustrated and warmly written chapters - using gear that can be found in the chambers and tunnels within the castle.
Rely on abilities that can be obtained by spending cheese (kind of the usual experience points) and last but not least hope for the cheese to be rolled on your turn and not during the enemies.

If you like a “light” dungeon crawler or are a fan of classic pen&paper adventures, this might just be the boardgame you have been waiting for.

Chapter takes around 60 min to finish.

I love the design, love the theme, but the game itself is repetitive and very simple.  There's just not enough there to justify the investment of time (and each chapter is long).  If things moved along faster it might be a light, breezy dungeon crawl.  But it's a slow, plodding luck-fest.  I was wow'd by the production for a while, but that has passed.  And the rulebook - it's a mess!  Bummer, wanted to really like it, expected MouseGuard Lite.

I love this game.  My biggest hang up was the rule book.  I had to look through bgg for a lot of ambiguous rules situations that are not covered in the rule book.  Once you do have the rules down though the game plays out very nicely... at least so far.  We will have to see what I think after a full campaign.

Although on the simple side, M&M (as Rio calls it) plays well and is a whole lot of fun. The components are nice, the minis painted up nicely, and the most important thing is that Rio is really enjoying this game...he finally seems to be back in a boardgaming mood.

5/5/13: I'm changing my rating to a 7. The game is too much about preventing cheese going on to the cheese wheel. There is almost no danger that the mice get killed (captured). Every time we loose, it is because the minions rolled lots of cheese, bringing the game to an end before we could complete the objectives. Therefore we are just looking for ways to slow the cheese wheel, like attacking primarily with Filch and Lily.

Currently in our campaign game we are as follows:

Maginos:
chain lightning
warding staff

Filch:
Find, Energry Rush, Dodge
Ring of Cat Strength

Lily:
Preemptive Shot, Accurate Shot
Mystic Tomb

Tilda:
Cure, First Aid
Toothpick

Collin:
Battle Leader, Give Order
Mystic Blade

Nez:
Battle Squeak, Set Trap
Walnut Shell Breastplate

9/8/13: We tried this again with the following house rules designed to make the game more about surviving combat and less about preventing cheese going on the cheese wheel:
- Filling the Cheese Wheel does not advance the chapter if it causes a surge;
- Every foe has +1 hearts.
After playtesting this we decided it wasn't working. Extra hearts for minions means extended play time, so we dropped that. Not advancing the chapter with a surge was too easy, so we dropped that as well. So we had a long game that was too easy...not good.

9/10/13:
We tried playing with cheese rolled on minion's dice is ignored, and any mice wounds puts 2 cheese on the cheese wheel. This was pretty tough, but it is nice in that defending minions don't put cheese on wheel...we like that!

9/11/13: New house rules seem almost right!
Minion dice do not add to cheese wheel.
Every mouse wound puts one cheese on the cheese wheel. This is a little too easy. But we like the feel. The game plays faster because if you auto-kill a minion, you don't have to roll for cheese. There are a few other tweaks necessary. For example, greedy roaches now steal 2 cheese, rather than stealing cheese and putting it on the cheese wheel (they still only do 1 damage, and if a mouse has only one cheese, they just steal one). So we should just be able to add a little something to make it a little tougher and I think we've got a better game!

9/14: So these new house rules are working pretty well in terms of the feel of the game, but now the game is too easy. We are going to make the opponents harder.
Spider: can make either a melee or ranged attack.
Roach: is granted a "Charge" ability. If after moving it is unable to make a melee attack, it can use one of its attack dice to make another movement roll. It continues doing this until it can make an attack or it runs out of dice.
Roaches and Rats: Every time roaches and rats spawn, designate one figure as a "Boss". Its stats are all at +1, including hearts.
These house rules are holding up pretty well, if a little on the easy side...

Currently in our campaign game we are on chapter 5 and equiped as follows:

Maginos:
chain lightning, meeps, invisibility
Lucky Skullcap

Filch:
Energry Rush
Spear

Lily:
Preemptive Shot, Accurate Shot, power shot, aimed shot, keen eye.
Accurate Bow

Tilda:
First Aid
Button Shield

Collin:
Inspire
Thimble Helm

Nez:
Battle Squeak, Set Trap
Walnut Shell Breastplate

Fun so far, good for playing with the family.  However, if you are trying to lead the family in a game, especially with younger kids, I find there is a lot of little tidbits to remember and it is a bit tough to keep things flowing smoothly.  Hopefully this will get better as I get more familiar with the game.

I used to love Mice and Mystics because of its theme: now, thirty games later, the spell has ended (along with the campaign). With the right group - mainly kids or non-gamers - it still works as a gateway game and might even be a hit: but in the end it’s too repetitive to keep its allure on gamers of any other kind. 

Actually all you can do over and over is fighting, finding new ways to optimize your party’s skills and searching for items you most likely won’t be allowed to take into the next scenario: in the end it’s just Heroquest with cheese and a cute wrapping.

The worse is, with so many good cooperatives around that never play the same I can’t see Mice and Mystics played too often by my regular group: rather, as soon as we’re over with Glorm as well I think it’ll be buried on the shelf with the other well-meaning games that we never play.

Got to play with my daughter, age 4 at time of purchase.  She enjoyed the couple partial chapters we have done.

I have tried to play this several times and it just doesn't work for my daughter and I. Most recently it took about an hour to get past the first side of the tile in Chapter 1 and when we did all the mice only had 1 health remaining. I realize the dice were very much against us this outing, but it's not an uncommon result for when this game is brought out. I'm really disappointed that we haven't been able to enjoy the game at all in multiple attempts. I had high hopes for this and may give it another try or two.

All stuff is combined into the two large boxes, small box is gone.

Thin story line poisoned by inexecrable writing and then overwhelmed by tedious game mechanics. How many dice do you need to roll to get something done? Missing any interesting player decisions.

So far this game has exceeded the high expectations with which we arrived. The chapters are long but the balanced combat, searching, and trap avoidance keeps children and adults engaged in the game play. Smooth mechanics and the "Sooo cute" characters have moved this game from rental to must buy status. 

Revision: Some of the chapters run ridiculously long, which makes the game really start to drag. This resulted in the majority of the party losing interest in whether or not they completed the mission.

RATING: 6.5
Rated after three and a half plays.

I love the theme and the production values.

We lost our first two games (the first and second scenario), and then had a very easy time on our second replay of the first scenario.  Luck played a huge factor in our failures.

I strongly disagree with the 7 and up age rating.  10 is more realistic.  Unless it's an exceptional/experienced 7 year  old, they are just going to end up rolling the dice.

I'll probably never play this game again and it is simply because of the dice mechanics.  The theme is great, the production value is high, and I wanted to like the game.  But, in the end it is quite similar to one of the current D&D board games, like Ashardalon.  The choices you make in the game really aren't that interesting and they come down to dice rolls that can either favour you heavily or cheat you consistently.

If I were rating this strictly on gameplay, I would probably give it a 6, maybe a 7, because while it is fairly solid, it's overly simplified so parents can play it with their kids.
But, the main draw of this game isn't its gameplay, but the wonderfully written and illustrated storybook. It's like playing through and excessively charming and adorable version of Redwall, and on the grounds of its artwork and its narritive, it is absolutely irresistible.

As I've matured as a gamer I find myself leaning more toward the euro than the ameritrash side of things, but M&M was a welcome gaming experience. The story is well written and pretty compelling. The gameplay is simple enough not to get too fiddly but has some unique things that it accomplishes through the various tokens and scenario rules for the chapter. I wish there was a cartoon set in this universe, I would so watch it lol. Looking forward to seeing what happens to Prince Collin and the gang in the future.

This is a fantastic adventure and exploration story game. There is never a time that I don't want this to hit the table. The characters feel different, the story is incredibly engaging, and the game play is simple, elegant and enjoyable. The minis in this game are fun to paint and make the experience even better having them come to life with color. I would say the best thing about this game is that it is a fantastic way to introduce people to adventure games because it's approachable, but also has lots of depth and keeps even seasoned gamers engaged. It's a great way to get into miniature painting because the fantastic character sheets that come with each mini give players a guideline for painting and picking colors. All around this is an incredible game, I can't recommend it enough.

Decent story-driven 'dungeon crawl'. I've only gotten through the first chapter (on the third attempt, but first time with my daughter who is a great roller), and I can see a couple of problems. The main being it seems like we've seen the whole game already. We've fought and beaten all the miniatures in the game, just not the bosses. Sure there will be new map tiles, but no real satisfying level up achievements (just new abilities of which we've already picked the best), and no escalating power for minions, again just the bosses. Second main issue for me seems to be limited strategic choices. So far we basically just attack the closest foe and hope for good rolls, really with a choice on whether to spend a cheese to use a power or not. Hopefully more opens up. 

My daughter likes the story so far so that's good, the production values are great (I've painted the minis), and the base mechanics are good.  But I do wonder if we'll get through the whole campaign.

Play this again and again with my 5 and 6 year old. My 5 year old wakes up wanting to play this every day. By for me it’s saturating it. It’s a dice chucker so I can only play it so much. With that said it’s loads of fun with my kids....except when we get bogged down with bad dice rolls. The story is fun but annoying when it calls out characters you don’t have on the board. All that being said, I enjoy my time playing with the kids, not sure if it would be as much fun with adults. Solid 8. Great story, and great bits. I painted them all, custom cheese and insert; so I guess I like it well enough!

Have really been enjoying this solo! Can become pretty fast-paced once you've got the basic mechanics down. Overall, a simple game, so I can see how some players may lose interest when playing with others. Playing solo solves this for me, and I feel quite immersed in the story as it unfolds. And it really is about the story. It may not be a good fit for players who aren't interested in a narrative-type game. Also, the rules that come in the box are vague and/or insufficient on many points, so frustration may result for those who don't like to or are unable to make judgments concerning the interpretation of rules. Love the figures!

Very entertaining and thematic.  Strategy is light, but not absent.  I used to own Warhammer Quest, which was similar, but I like this one better.  I wasn't a fan of the see-if-you-roll-a-one mechanic in Warhammer Quest.  It's also similar to the Castle Ravenloft series; maybe of roughly equal game depth and theme tie-in.

Mice and Mystics is probably the best storytelling game I've played. And, I didn't realize before playing how important and embedded the "choose-your-own-adventure" storytelling nature is to the game experience. It's got familiar dungeon crawl mechanics, but with a wonderful theme/flavor and a very approachable system. We were up and running in no time with our first chapter.

This is light years ahead of something like Tales of Arabian Nights, which is all "story" but with nothing actually backing that veneer up in gameplay.

Gioco che personalmente adoro giocare, sia per la sua ambientazione sia per la semplicità e la fluidità delle partite che volano tra una battaglia e l'altra. Mice and Mystics è un gioco che trasforma il genere Dungeon Crawler in qualcosa di molto più veloce e semplice, si presenta con tante regole che si riassumono maggiormente sulle facce dei vari dadi. La sua ambientazione e le sue illustrazioni fanno la loro parte, portando i giocatori a recitare la storia seguendola tramite il libretto delle quest che aiuta a sentirsi dentro al gioco ancora di più.

RATING: 3
While this game seems to have a lot of praise, I have to admit I haven't enjoyed my time with it at all. The combat system is the main problem here - the fights are boring, with very little meaningful decisions and victory is almost entirely luck-based (thanks to the ridiculous cheese mechanic). Enemies are boring and have very little variation, and while the story aspects here are very good I don't think it's worth the grinding waste of time that makes up every single encounter. 

Potentially a good entry level game for very young children, will update when I play it with the kids when they're old enough.

I watched 2 30+ minute videos. I read the rules. I printed out player aids. For a 4p game, 3 people *tried* to take their turns before we gave up in frustration. This game is utterly unplayable out of the box. Sure, I could spend another hour re-watching videos, and several more hours reading everything every single post on BGG to try to figure out what went wrong, but it's simply NOT WORTH IT. Buyer beware, and don't be sucked in by what the fanboys on BGG tell you.

Also TERRIBLE rule book which makes looking up rules even worse

This isn't a game you play for crunchy tactical strategy. Its charm lies in the progression of the story and the innocence of the theme. Hardcore RPGers might get bored with the constant dice rolling, an aspect which makes the game wildly swingy. But this game isn't made for them. It's made for light RPGers and newcomers to the genre, and in that role, it shines. I can easily see this as the kind of game that could convert novices to the genre into fans - especially children, for whom the game is tailor made.

We are now on chapter 10, I recommend adopting a max of two plays per chapter.

So far I am finding the game enjoyable despite the poorly organised and porrly worded rulebook. The first chapter seems easy but that is probably in part because of my incredible tendancy to not roll cheese for the minions to add to the cheese wheel of doom thus preventing them from bringing a new surge of enemies and stepping the time limit closer to a loss. I'm sure I'll find some rules that I didn't get right even though I have already watched the designer explain the gameplay. I was glad to find Ace Comics in Annerley has a good range of games and decent prices. The weeks of recovery from my operation - at home alone - will be a lot more fun with a new solo game.

Kids love it especially Lachlan. Still not clear on all the rules so it is going slower than it should. 

Rules continue to plague the session slowing it down far too much. rating dropped to 7 for now. May go back up if I can learn it well enough to play without rules referencing.

RATING: 6
Overall rating 6. Rating for a group of adult gamers 4. Solo rating 6. Rating as a family game 8. I find the game a dull repetitive affair with very little meaningful decision-making. However, it is great game to play with kids. The strongest aspect of the game is theme and looks: the component quality is very high, art is superb etc (rating +2). Plus there are some nice ideas, such as  as spaces corresponding to the objects in the rooms, some items, such as fork catapult etc. (rating +1). I am neutral in regard to several aspects of the game. For instance, it is great to have the campaign woven into a story but the story is not that good. Try to translate it - I have to because my kids do not speak English – and you will see how empty it occasionally is. Sometimes I also have to skip paragraphs because they do not fit the actual game session: often you have a specific mouse speaking of things which are specific to him/her but the mouse may not be in this particular game. Some aspects of the game are bad: the rules overhead is ridiculous considering how light the game is (rating -2);  the game is also too shallow with basically no meaningful decision-making. (rating -2) the mouse abilities are not balanced (rating -1) and the movement die slows the game down and can be frustrating (rating -1). To sum up. It is a nice looking game but too light and repetitive for serious gamers. It is a great family game, though, if one of the parents is willing to invest in learning the rules and takes the responsibility for running the sessions filling in the gaps and making things up to make it more entertaining for the kids.

Potentially a good game but the story was too long to keep young boys entertained and engaged.  May be it was my reading.  I never recommended the game partially because the company refuse to send my a french version of the book and I had to translate part of it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very charming, Redwall style story driven, co-op modular adventure game. I LOVE this game. The rule book is set up in a clever manner, making it like a story book in nature. The book explains the basic premise of a Prince and his friends who are turned into Mice by an evil sorceress. She has made the Prince's father, the King, ill and intends to kill him so she can take his throne with the Prince and his friends out of the way.

It's up to you and your friends to find you way through the castle, fending off anthropomorphic rats, spoopy spiders ; roaches ; and centipedes, as well as avoiding the sorceress' nasty cat. Find equipment, gain character abilities, etc. The game's scenarios each cover a different 'chapter' of the book and some even had side objectives you can complete as well. 

I highly recommend this game for players new to tabletop due to it's very light on mechanic nature and rich story telling. Combat is pretty basic and easy to grasp, the components are beautiful (I had the stock tan minis painted by a good friend to liven up the board even more) and the story is genuinely interesting and charmingly written.

Wonderful, wonderful game.

This is the closest game I have to an Ameritrash game.  I really love the story lines in this game.  The game-play is fun, but the timer mechanism can make it difficult to be able to complete side quests.  There are a lot of variability in this game that makes the replay-ability interesting.

One downside was getting the treachery card that cause all the hordes of bad guys to come at us at once.  We all got knocked out one by one and ended up not being able to win the game because we all got captured.

Another confusing rule was ending the round knocking out the minions causes the medium bad guy to appear.  I did read that an alternate rule would make an exception to this if it were the last player in turn order who took out the last minion would get an extra round to escape the room.

German edition, at least, has not good quality components. Tiles, cards and character sheets are low quality (you will need sleeves from the first play for the cards) and printing is not so good as you can expect from a standard published game.

It's very dissapointing for me each time I open the box. Components don't fit. There is no custom nest for the tiles, for example, so they move against the sides of the box and so on. I had to add some zip bags for the tokens to keep a minimum order.

The game itself seems ok and it's amusing for little kids. For grown up people... I'm not sure. There are many holes in the rules to take it as a serious game. It reminds me of Heroquest with the fairy theme around, and that's fine, but I expect a corrected edition and some community fixes to the rules soon :D

Love the concept[*], love the artwork / bits / production, love some of the details. (Cheese wedges as a clock. Time pressure even between encounters. Leveling up / special abilities. The flipping boards for up/down.)

But... holy crud, the dice-rolling. It's not the raw quantity - I play RPGs with lots of dice-rolling - so it's either the swinginess (few dice rolled at once = high variance) or that it feels kind of like a slogfest (doing a lot more rolling-of-dice than anything else). The positioning was interesting when it came up, but at least with melee foes it seemed like past a certain point it was only relevant insofar as you could tweak who was getting attacked how often.

Also, I'm kind of irritated / disappointed at the way the story uses certain gender tropes. In the base game and scenario book, all of the virtuous/powerful NPC good-guys are male, and the villains are an evil sorceress and her conniving daughter. There are 6 playable PCs, 2 of whom are female: one is a healer, and the other you can't play until you've rescued her. Obviously, this isn't enough to bother everyone, but it bothers me.

* = Though I'd have liked it even more if it weren't about humans-turned-mice, but always-mice, a la Mouse Guard.

There aren't huge numbers of interesting decisions to be made on a turn, and there is a ton of dice rolling, but I enjoy seeing how the conflicts pan out.

After two plays, I'm not seeing how my decisions are greatly affecting the outcome. After getting creamed in the second game, much worse than in our naive first game, I feel at the whim of the game's luck.

My first dungeon crawl. It's thematic, with a fun little story to read along and to play through. The minis are nice to my inexperienced eye, though I can take or leave them in general. It and the expansions keep growing the story in fun ways. I look forward to each one.

(this actually ranks higher when compared to my other games, but my 9+ rankings are all for solo games)

Initial rating is 8 with a chance to go higher. The game is quite family-oriented, which limits its appeal just a bit for some -- for my family, though, it hits a good spot. The rating may go higher or lower based on my experience of the campaign.

[July 2017]
Have lost interest. Rules had some ambiguities, kids got older, read more about how dice-determined the game is, story doesn't grab me as much as many other more recent dungeon crawlers.

Two hours of fuzzy mice, fuzzy rules, and dice-rolling.

The theme is charming, the artwork is great, and the minis are adorable, but the game feels way too long for something so light.  There's little variety and you spend so much time just rolling, rolling, rolling.

The rulebook is very underwritten.  You will probably need to houserule to make the game work.

RATING: 4
Average GAME but with a very cute story.  Well, actually the game isn't really average as it just isn't very fun.

The Artwork and look of the game is out of this world great though!

Which, when I reflect upon it, is why I think I bought it in the first place.

RATING: 4
WARNING: The game information is incorrect. It is a co-operative game for 4 players. For any other number of players, you have to improvise each player playing multiple characters without any adjustments/simplifications in the rules.

In addition, the game tries to combine a dungeon crawler with a storytelling game, but the dungeon crawler part is too long, drowning the storytelling, while at the same time being highly repetitive, thus not being a very good dungeon crawler either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We are replaying this and trying to get through the entire base game so we can play the expansion. The ruleset is not quite as robust as it probably needed to be and some of the decisions they made after the fact didn't make much sense to me. Scrolls being read as a non-action but only during your turn while standing on your left foot whilst simultaneously not counting as a free action while standing on your right foot seemed peculiar. I poke fun because I enjoy it. It's a quality experience I get to have with my oldest son.

Had a first go with my son to explore the first chapter and we had a great time. It does take some time to learn the rules and to get familiar with the game play, but once you're in the game it really is a lot of fun. We bought this game second hand with all the miniatures painted, which does add a lot as it looks so much better. Can't wait to play again :)

Amazing graphic design and production values. I can see younger players diving right into the world of Mice and Mystics and having a great time.

For adult gamers however there's simply not enough gameplay choices or strategic/tactical decisions to be made. This game is all about story and theme. Playing the game is mostly about throwing dice and because of this we ran into situations where the mice were constantly captured because of repeated bad luck with the dice (this can result to both getting beaten up in battle and the cheese clock constantly being filled and spawning new enemies).

There's clearly so much love and effort put into this game that it's a pity there's not enough depth for more mature gamers.

Got this in April of 2013 with the intent of being able to play a fun cooperative game with my niece (9 yrs old) and nephew (16 yrs old).  Our first play was only slightly successful and my niece's attention wavered before we could finish the scenario.  I think reading the intro story for 15 minutes was a little too much, and when we play this again I'll probably just paraphrase it.

A constant hack-and-slash dice game.

 It has great components and I feel that the scenarios seem well-designed. In many respects it is superior to Descent and its ilk, but at the end of the day it is the repeated throwing of dice with very very few meaningful decisions.

Mice and Mystics (4) seconda partita per me e prima per gli altri. sbagliamo ad interpretare i simboli sui dadi per la prima parte della partita (cosa che poi ha determinato la sconfitta- colpa mia che sono una lettrice di regolamenti davvero pessima!!) ma quando ci accorgiamo che spada/scudo vale come risultato per l'attacco  ragni, blatte e millepiedi cominciano a morire a manciate!  
gran bel gioco e non vedo l'ora di giocarci ancora!!! 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ieri sera lunghissima, emozionante, frustrante, coinvolgente, divertente, sorprendente partita a Mice and Mystics, edizione italiana appena comprata. i topi sono sconfitti in cucina mentre tentano di battere il malefico gatto Brodie. Ma non è il felino il responsabile della disfatta, bensì un troppo entusiasta topo mago, Maginos, che con un'esplosione ha la meglio, sì sul gatto, ma anche sui suoi compagni!!  
Il gioco è bello, bello, bello! componenti da paura, grafica eccellente, ambientazione riuscita, sentita, rispettata... manciate e manciate di dadi da lanciare, carte da pescare, formaggio che attiva abilità, ratti, blatte e millepiedi da affrontare... BELLOOOOO!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mice and Mystics giocato tantissimo, consumato da venerdì a domenica! tutti lo volevano provare e riprovare. 
fatte 3 partite e fatta giocare una quarta. 
Con i ragazzi (11 e 14 anni) facciamo i primi tre scenari in fila in modalità campagna. 
perdiamo il primo, che è più bastardo degli altri secondo me. la sconfitta è ad opera di un millepiedi mangia formaggio proprio a pochi passi dall'albero e dalla vittoria, aggiungo: il vecchio corvo ha vinto il premio dello str... a furor di popolo! 
Scenario 2 vinto per un pelo grazie al Dominatore del cacio... eh eh 3 formaggi su 4 dadi. 
Scenario 3 andato alla grande per la fortuna davvero incredibile del quattordicenne!

I have a soft place in my heart for this one, as it really piqued the interest of my kiddos... at first. Along with Castle Panic, this game introduced us to the hobby of non-traditional board gaming. It seems like a fair system, an interesting plot, a great atmosphere... but honestly there's a point at which you just feel like you're endlessly rolling die after die. It just gets old, eventually.

Super fun, super thematic game.  Takes the "story" behind a game to a whole new level.  Never played anything quite like it.  Bonus points because the wife loves this one so much.

Has just a bit too much dice rolling for my tastes, but I'll give it a pass because the theme is so adorable.

Late to the party on M+M, but I had high hopes.   Have to say I was pretty disappointed.   The production is nice, the miniatures are very well done, the books are nice (looking), but the system itself is rather basic and dull.  The rules leave a lot of holes for such a simple game, which is frustrating.   The story elements are the best thing here, because the actual game mechanics are boring and very repetitive.   I think this would have been a big hit about 6 years ago when my kids were younger.   For an entry-level dungeon crawler with a good (but derivative) narrative arc, this might be a great selection, but I don't see it getting much play for me, personally.  The right audience will love this.  But I'd much rather play Talisman, Space Hulk, or DungeonQuest.

The game is full of character and atmosphere. The mechanics are fairly straight forward and exciting. Growing up on Readwall and that series this game brings many of those books to life. That said though this is a game that looks to be for young adults and children, but with mechanics and a difficulty that caters more towards the gamer crowd. It's funny really. I can't decide if the game was made for children in mind, or for gamer parents of children who see it as a way to get their children to become gamers with them. I keep thinking I want to get my nephew to play but I keep thinking about how it takes a bit of gaming the system and I keep it shelved.

Downgrading from an initial 10: my two girls and I really enjoyed the game at first, but it became a slog to finish the story book. Though there are some nice features to explore (such as the grape catapult), the game experience devolves into dice-rolling attacks against minion after minion. Story tries to be non-linear, but does not quite succeed. Please note, though, my younger daughter (age 9) loves it. I want to love it more.

this is a very hard game to rate. it seems to be a subject and style that my 7 year old enjoys. she likes the back story and while we haven't tried a campaign yet we are progressing through the story book and having a good time doing so. 

That said the rules/rule book is a mess, to the point that i can't be certain that i'm even playing the game as intended. I certainly wouldn't be able to recommend this to anyone but an Alpha gamer who isn't bothered by a difficult rules set, yet i don't believe the game is difficult to play.

a rules rewrite is badly needed.

so i'd rate this an 8 for a good family activity (would rate 5-6ish for adult game sessions) and a 4 for the rules... so my initial rating is a 6

The narrative of M&M is what makes the game for me. The story that unfolds as you go through the campaign is really fun to work through. As for the game itself I had some issues. The gameplay is fairly repetitive and very heavily luck dependent. The rules are also poorly written so it is easy to accidentally make the game much harder on yourself then is required. I was happy to play through the campaign but quickly traded the game away once we were done.

2016-09-17 : 10 plays in and the game became a bit repetitive, as if running on rails - there's no clever puzzles or anything new to discover - lowering my score from 8 to 6 as a consequence.

RATING: 4
Game is very inviting and while we really wanted to enjoy this game due to the story, miniatures and other components, we didn't because of the repetitive and constant dice rolling that has minimal decision making, the controlling multiple mice for games with less than 4 people and the large amount of information to keep track of (inventory, abilities, etc.) per mouse.  This game was not for us.

RATING: 8
First off, this game has miniatures - hooray! Second, the theme is amazing. Third, the roleplaying aspect really draws you in and adds a great layer to the co-op nature of the game. Every game is a blast and I really enjoy playing through the chapters and watching the story unfold. So far I have only played with the same group of people. I imagine the game wouldn't be quite as fun if you are constantly switching who you play with because it is a lot of fun to recall together how previous chapters played out.

The rulebook is horrible. Game is pretty and really wanted to like it, but in the end, very boring and repetitive with constantly looking at the rulebook, even though it´s an easy game...?!?

RATING: 4
The wonderful theme-oozing narrative and campaign portion of the game helped pull me through the otherwise monotonous gameplay. Very open to house rules (however they are also almost mandatory, because the rulebook is horribly vague). The dice provide frustrating lessons in luck, since players lack useful mitigation tools. 

Since completing the campaign, which I did in fact enjoy, I doubt I'll ever revisit the base game.  I could be convinced to give the expansions a play through, but otherwise this will just gather dust. [Pro Tip: Filch forever]

Wow.  Tough game.  I completely underestimated it as far as the brutality a bunch of rats and roaches can inflict on your meeses.

Interesting enough, if you don't have players working together, it might be *harder* with more than the 1 in the solo game.  Of course, with 1, it's more housekeeping and dice rolling...

Hmmm... after I finished I realized I made a couple of significant mistakes that made the enemies much tougher, and I didn't take advantage of several of the hero's abilities... which would undo my assessment that having multiple players makes it tougher!  :D

RATING: 4
Maybe I just don't like dungeon crawls. Decisions are obvious and luck is too prevalent. Feels very samey every turn. But I want to like it so I hang on to it, maybe I'll find the right group that will like the experience despite the mechanics.

* Update: Traded for Lost Valley. The game is charming but too fiddly and lacks strategy.

Cute, very thematic, and sure looks nice, but it's a kids game only IMO. The game gets kudos for being very thematic and driving a scenario-based story; it's probably a great option for young kids, though I'd probably still nerf the knockouts. Unfortunately, the gameplay is tedious and dull to the point where you're just throwing dice with a minimal amount of decisions. 

The biggest drawback to me is how unforgiving the game is. If you roll poorly, there's very little chance you're going to recover. If a character gets knocked out and you're a man down, you're pretty much done. There should be ways to overcome some missed shots/lost characters, otherwise one bad turn and the attrition makes playing any further a moot point, and then you have restart the whole chapter. I would recommend that knocked out characters lose a turn then come back; sheesh, even Descent gives you this much cushion.

I decided to introduce my kids to the joys of D&D-type campaign games. Mice & Mystics is a fantastic option. It's whimsical enough for the kids to relate to (mice & creepy crawlies are a bit more kid-centric than barbarians & orcs) and reasonably straight forward to play. And because it's co-op, even the younger ages can enjoy it without being penalised too much. Absolutely beautiful art work, great story line that goes with the game. A beautiful little treasure for the family & gamer alike.

So far we have found this game surprisingly challenging, despite having a children's story feel to it. If you like cooperative games with great aesthetics, terrific components, and a little silliness mixed in with adventure, this is the perfect game. My only complaints are that it can be a little clunky at times and some of the scenarios do not scale well to different numbers of players. Replayability could use some improvement as well.

[b]Gave Away[/b]
see previous comments below.

[b]previous comment:[/b]

I got Mice and Mystics in a trade a long time ago, played the first mission and quickly put it away.  Recently, I've been going through my collection, identifying games that don't get played and should be considered for trade or donation.  I decided to play one more mission, just to make sure I wasn't missing anything, before it went on the chopping block.

I got through setup and started reading the mission rules, got bored, and put the game away.  The mechanics are the easiest of easy roll-and-see-if-I-hit silliness, and the minimal character progression and variety from equipment options is nowhere near enough to rekindle my interest in what are completely uninspiring mechanics.  The story of the game is quite good, and I think I might just read the story bits out of the rule book before getting rid of it, but the actual gameplay is utterly unengaging.  At bare minimum, the different rules for each room during a mission should be on separate cards which can be placed next to that room for easy reference.  Playing a game with a rule book sitting in my lap is just not interesting to me.

I am typically pretty hesitant to rate a game until I've played many times, but the fact that this game manages to mesh extremely simple gameplay with way-too-complicated rules for that gameplay means I can be pretty confident that it lands in the "could be convinced to play (with someone who has the rules memorized) I guess" category.

This is a game that I could see being wonderful to play with children, with the adult acting as a sort of DM.  Since I don't have kids, if I have to sit there with a rule book in my lap, DMing my own on-rails adventure story, I'd much rather just DM a game of D&D and have some actual interesting decisions to make.

2017-02-20: I knew this would be a 'dumbed down' version of dungeoncrawl but it has a lot of people raving about it so I had some hopes about this game. 

I think my reaction to this shows how much I've 'grown' as a gamer since the 90s when this would probably have been OK. I just found it stupidly repetitive! That there is so few different monsters in the box definitely doesn't help either.

Every part of the scenario went:
Flip a board. Add enemies. Run up to them and roll a gazillion dice. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
There is some minimal strategy to where to stand and when to kill/run in regards to the timing of the cheese-wheel, but it is abysmal.
It is just, mostly, rolling dice and doing the quite obvious choices.
I understand the theme and mechanics are meant to allow kids to join in and play the game but boy. . . . what kid can stand these dragged out 2-3 hours game of rolling rolling rolling?
Very disappointed. I might play through the game solo just to have done it, but I'm really not sure it is worth it.
50usd down the drain. sigh. . . 

And I thought the rules were actually quite hard to follow. The rules are there for the most part, it is just a bad 'flow' in the structure of the rules.

initial rating = 3 (sooooo repetitive!)

La fuerza de este juego reside en el arte y sobre todo en la historia que lleva la campaña. La mecánica resulta demasiado simple y las reglas tienen vacíos que los jugadores pueden aprovechar para equiparse. Quizás esté más orientado a jugar con niños... No muchos juegos están pensados para esto.

My brother and his daughter painted the minis, and the game just looks fantastic. Indeed I fell in love with it right away, and it has a few excellent design choices (the dice, and the whole system around them, really, work very well). However: 1) it's a bear to set up and so is extremely difficult to get to the table 2) it's more processional than I expected 3) it's a lot more rules-fiddly than I thought at first. I got it to be a gentle introduction to playing in character for my eldest, and I'm not sure how effective that has been. But he certainly loves playing it, and often is the first game he requests.

RATING: 8
A great family game.  The theme is amazing with a truly wonderful story.  The game is not as complicated as descent which is good for playing with younger kids and people that are not big board gamers.  The downside is that it may get very repetitive quickly and the want to replay quests is not their.  I would give this game a lower score if it was not for the story.  The main appeal here is the story though and is definitely better in my opinion then what you will find in similar dungeon crawls.

Dungeon crawler with an amazing amount of theme. Everything in this game is dripping with theme and it looks great on the table. Unfortunately there is too much dice rolling for my taste.

This also translates into many opportunities to get screwed by the dice. There should have been some more ways to mitigate the amount of cheese that gets added to the wheel. You can lose this game through no fault of your own, but by a string of bad rolls.

Awesome production quality and a rich theme with great artwork.  My children have really enjoyed it and I think it's great for families, but I don't see myself ever playing this with anyone but children.  There aren't as many meaningful decisions to be made as I was hoping for, and our first game took about 2 and a half hours even though we were defeated.  But I have to say that the time went by pretty quickly, and it felt like we were part of an interesting story.  I look forward to trying it with my girls again soon.

A medium-light heavily thematic game that has the appeal of a dungeon crawl all while maintaining a whimsical theme of mice warriors.

The "AI" of the game presents challenging decisions to make but keeps the game at a level that it can still be defeated - and it can still defeat you (none of that overbearing "AI" victory nonsense we find in games like Arkham Horror.

If you need a break from more intense games that are trying on any veteran game player's stamina and patience, Mice and Mystics is a fantastic game to enter into the realm of mice-dom and slay you some vermin!

Mostly fun, lighter dungeon-crawler. 2nd scenario is poorly designed, requiring one player to start the game stuck in a trap and remain there hoping the other players can rescue him.

RATING: 5
Sort of a child-friendly dungeon crawler. Think of Descent but add a cute backstory and cut down on rules (and, incidentally, largely on decisions). Despite these changes to become more accessible the game is still somewhat fiddly in parts, and the rules have about as many holes as the featured cheese. Due to the lack of notable decisions the game quickly becomes somewhat repetitive once the story loses a bit of its luster (the standard play sequence being: enter new room, kill all enemies, advance to next room). It also seems like the balance can tilt heavily either way because of how the game deals with random encounters.

Mice and Mystics is likely a good choice with children, going on an adventure and experiencing a fairy tale together. For (somewhat) grown-up dungeon crawlers, however, the game offers little excitement and cannot truly challenge the veterans.

Phenomenal light dungeoncrawler with a heavy story element. I'm currently playing this game chapter by chapter with my wife. We are playing slowly over several nights after we put the kids to bed. We are both having a blast. I think it is the simplicity of it that is so enjoyable. It is a nice story and we find it just challenging enough to stay engaged with the game mechanics. Personally, this is the most fun gaming together we have had in a while.

The game system uses very well-used mechanics but ones that everyone is comfortable with and are easy to work with. There are points, however, where we kept forgetting little rules, and clarification in the rulebook was slight. Still, we were able to keep the pace up and enjoyed ourselves almost right to the end.

There are some very good ideas in this game - I love the double-sided boards and the initiative system. However in play the randomness of the dice overwhelm everything else, and I found the combat fiddly and not much fun. Since that's mostly what you do in the game, I wasn't so impressed.

In my second play I was doing very well in the first scenario and went to the kitchen. The roaches rolled a lot of cheese, the cat appeared, and killed us all. Not very interesting. I think I'm done with this game. I'm glad I didn't buy it.

FWIW I thought the rules were perfectly adequate. Several people have mentioned doing away with the defence rolls - I agree entirely. Way too boring.

Ok family game, though I was expecting something a little more substantial. Conversely, I wasn't expecting how much quasi DM'ing and scenario-specific rule implementations I would be doing. Not feeling it. 

Light, lots of theme, beautiful artwork and a good children's story. The gameplay is a repetitive dice-fest but my kids don't really mind this aspect of it since they're fans of Mouse Guard and can get into the theme.

Edit 2/2015: Sold on the BGG Market. Kids don't really dig it any more, and I never really did.

A full play of this removed some concerns over the way the Search mechanic works, but I still have some concerns about one player dominating others. The game seems to reward teamwork, which in coop games also tends to reward one player trying to dictate the actions of the other players.

Still, this was a fun game and my one play came down to the very last roll, unfortunately we lost the roll and the evil old crow ended our game in defeat, but it was still enjoyable overall.

May adjust the rating after further plays.

Perfect for my young kids, and perhaps a gateway to other fantasy games like Descent and HeroQuest.  Kudos to Plaid Hat Games for designing a relatively simple dungeon crawler with a very immersive storyline.  Components are also top notch.  The rulebook does not go into enough detail to satisfy many situations that arise during gameplay, so I recommend improvising to not slow down gameplay.  There is a lot of dice rolling in the game (i.e. for movement), and it's disappointing when a series of bad dice rolls ruins your chance of winning a chapter.  Overall, it's not a perfect, but this is a fun and cute fantasy game that the family enjoys.

Love the setting in this approachable game. Debating whether I want this since I've invested in Galaxy Defenders and GD seems to have just a little more to it to make for more interesting decisions.

Thanks for getting the kids and I this great game Secret Santa 2014!

I'm still working on getting all the stuff painted before we play. Plus, I'm waiting for both the kids to know how to read well before we start in on the campaign. They enjoy the figures, and love fantasy adventure games, so I assume we'll like this.

Its...OK. The theme is cute but the game play is a bit repetive and enemy variety is severely lacking, which is odd considering 90% of the game is combat. For such a story driven game the story feels like it's superfluous and irrelevant. Replayability seems low, which is unfortunate. But, expansions should fix that if we find we enjoy it enough. The kids love the models and are very meh on the game play itself.

An "okay" dungeon crawler and that's it. There isn't enough meat to the game, it's way too simple (the rulebook has some flaws, but the core mechanics are easy to understand). Maybe if you're looking for a "heavy story driven game" it will do just fine, but I'd choose other games over this one (e.g. Imperial Assault).

+ Really nice design and story book. Love the speech and that are secondary missions to achieve...if yur team wants so. Like the theme and once rules are clear is nice to convince others to play a coop campaign. Like the dice system, not my mates though (some bad rolls and you may repeat the chapter). Like the item cards and abilities.

- Rulebook is just terrible. Our first episode lasted forever...we even didn't finished it that night. My group doesn't like it that much, worse than other coop campaign games and not enough short or fun to be played as a filler. Huge lack of variety of enemies in the game and how enemies appear during the play.

With everything, really inmersive story and charming heroes, perfect game to introduce other players (once rules are clear). I hope some day to complete the whole campaign. It seems not to be soon though:P.

RATING: 5
It's "fiddly." It does a good job of creating a dungeon crawl, and after you've played a few of the scenarios you realize the game is ripe with potential at creating your own adventures. BUT- the rules get in the way, and the  fantasy story that comes with the game is, I'm sorry to say, not well written. It honestly could have used a good copy editor.
And there's the rub for me.

This game is supposed to be ALL ABOUT THE STORY and for this part to fall short really takes the whole game down several notches for me. 
As a writer, it annoys me greatly.

Yes, it's supposed to be a "children's story." But,two  "ly" adverbs in the opening sentence, trite character behaviors based on class, and uninspired dialogue make it read more like a junior-high schooler's attempt at Secret of NIMH fan ficton.
Read by and enjoyed by a child, FINE.
Written by a child? NO.
With a few revisions and a little more structure, the story could have been good enough, and it would have helped the game immensely in my opinion.

On it's own, Mice and Mystics is a fine dungeon crawl, and a great effort from Plaid Hat Games. The components are top notch, the included figures have great detail, and it can be infinitely repayable. But there are other games out there that do this better: Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Super Dungeon Explore, Mage Knight, even Munchkin.

I don't know why you'd have to have this in your collection. I bought it because of the rave reviews I read including one on Drake's Flames.
Sorry, Matt. You were off on this one. 
Artistically, however, it looks great on the shelf, which in my house, is were is stays most of the time.

I LOVE the mice pawns (and I even bought the Lily doll) but I really don't like the way this game treats rats. Real rats are intelligent, social animals, and they're friendly and loving pets. Do we have to trash one rodent to be allowed to appreciate another?

Though, given Redwall (aka "Racism for Beginners") seems to be a major inspiration, I guess I shouldn't be too surprised.

BGG's rating scale is based on how much and how often you want to play the game in question, not how well-designed you think the mechanics are. A game that's well-designed but has themes that make you less interested in playing it should be given a lower score. In the end it all averages out.

A few runs at the first chapter, with zero success but total enjoyment, and one incomplete try at the second chapter just to keep the kids interested.

They like the game so much that when we can't get it on the table they "play" the game by pretending to be the characters. It's almost as much fun to watch them make up their own stories as it is to play the real game.

The components and the story are great. We are playing as a campaign and I must say our characters are getting a bit overpowered as we approach the end of the main story book. We have been leveling up along the way and have managed to obtain some very nice equipment. On our second play through I am going to suggest that if a character dies he/she starts from scratch again. I am not quite sure about replay ability yet as this is our first time through, but I think the base game is good for at least two campaigns which in our case would be 30-40 plays (with the same group). Of course this type of game will play differently with different groups, so your mileage may vary depending on the situation. 

There is a bit of randomness with the dice of course, but with careful item and ability selection this can be mitigated somewhat. This game plays well with my adult game group as well as with my teenage children, so it has that going for it as well. Overall I highly recommend.

After 30 plays I find my self wanting to play this more than I did when I started. The characters and the story really grow on you. 

Blown past 40 plays and could easily go through the campaign a few more times. As it is we moved on to Glorm and absolutely love it as well. Game is like a fine wine, my rating keeps ticking up over time.

Great fun game, easy to play and takes little to get used to. Takes a while on the first play through but once the basics are learned it massively speeds up and becomes much more enjoyable. Though the games best feature is the story/campaign feeling to playing your characters, seeing them level up and gain cool loot. this can be carried on to the next chapters and so forth. works very well. though surprised the game didn't come with a cheat sheet of how to keep track of these. we made our own!
Game does however need more enemies, as fighting the same ones over and over became a bit tedious. Needed that little bit more variety.

Recommended fr younger players and or families into D&D style questing.
Though also fun for hardcore guy, I imagine they will get bored quicker as the game goes on due to the repetitive nature.

Esta es una de mis asignaturas pendientes con el Sr. Vega. 

Es un dungeon crawler, pero como nota definitoria, es que los protagonistas son... ratones. y toda la historia es consecuente a ello. 

vamos, que un poco es como coger el concepto de aquella pelicula de disney "basil, the great mouse detective" (ratones antropomorfos que hacen lo equivalente a seres humanos) pero en un juego de mesa de mazmorreo. me encanta. xD

el problema es que "la unica manera de jugarlo es jugando la campaña entera", y claro. como esta el patio, como para montar una campaña. o_O

una curiosidad: aunque aqui en la lista y practicamente todo el mundo lo conoce por su titulo original en ingles, el juego en españa se publico con el titulo traducido "De Ratones y Magia". 

en fin. "pendiente de ver mesa", y probablemente seguira pendiente en 2032. :/

I think the obvious competition is with the D&D coops, which again most seem to dislike but I love. I prefer the D&D games, because it offers a greater variety of powers and enemies--Mice and Mystics feels rather samey to me after a few encounters. It does have nicer components, though.
I did find the rules shockingly hard to grok--I had to keep looking things up all the time, whereas other games of this weight offer less resistance.

Ok, I knew this isn't my kind of game, but I joined a session anyway. Well, that was a mistake, as there's just no game here. A complete waste of time. You are better of playing "Yathzee" which plays faster and probably offers more real decisions than this crap.

Everything is based on luck without any real decisions. You just roll the dice and watch what happens. I really can't understand how someone can find any fun in this. That's like staring at a wall for 2 hours...

Considering my dislike of flavour text and pre-written missions in games, this was way more fun to play than I had expected. 

I’m not sure boardgames are the right medium for what this game apparently wants to do: tell a story. In play it’s a series of very loosely connected tactical set-pieces on square grids with rather limited options, more or less held together by a framework of flavour text. It does get repetitive after a few chapters.

Recommended for a family of four, with the narrative creating obvious appeal for younger players. It's an incredibly thematic experience that keeps you coming back to enjoy the central campaign and story arch. It's essentially a light version of Descent, which is by no means a bad thing, and it injects a lot of its own unique mechanics and gameplay elements.

Lite family RPG Dungeon Crawl, Mostly very neat and smooth mechanics. Plays well with children and adults together. An all adult game table would be very underwhelmed, unless they were all redwall fanatics or something!. Scenarios can bog down sometimes and the children lose interest, bending the rules is required sometimes to keep the fun rolling. But when things are going well it's a joy watching the wee ones be so engrossed in your hobby

Wanted to like this. Really did. With an 8 year old gamer you'd think it would a shoe-in. He liked it, I thought it felt flat. Everything comes down a dice roll which on the whole of it isn't a bad thing but I feel the theme was lost behind so many dice rolls. It is more challenging than it looks which is a good thing.

My verdict: a very flat gaming experience with little depth. Theme doesn't transfer to the game itself. Very easy to die unless you are lucky (or very easy to live unless you are unlucky).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nicely done co-op. Pretty much everything relies on die rolls, but it seems to work out (and it's fully co-op so at least if things go horribly wrong, you're not alone).

RATING: 10
Fantastic!!! If you love books and stories this is for you- an interactive story book! Love that it can be played solo. Cooperative play is always fun too. (Great with those really willing to "play" the part of their character.) Art is beautiful. 
Just when you think there can't be anymore aspects to the game's mechanics/play there is a new element to factor in. 
Don't peek at future chapters. It's a lot more fun if you have no idea where the story will go next!

A couple of cool things about this game, but it quickly wears thin.  I like to play it every couple of months. I appreciate the accessibility it offers to children with the simple rule set and luck based gameplay, but there are some things I like about this game (movement rules, fun theme) and I don't always want to play with children.  An 'experienced' rule set would be nice...maybe.  I don't know maybe not.  Just less luck, maybe.  Yeah, keep the rules simple and take away some luck.  
     Also, this is important to me:  Everyone says that this is a good story, but the writing is horrendous.  They couldn't have hired a real writer?  It really seems like the designer pulled this out of his butt.  Everyone likes it, too.  I guess it's what I should expect when books like Game of Thrones and Wheel of Time are some of the most read fantasy.  It's hard for me to play this game sometimes because of this.

It's a dungeon crawler, a very basic one. It feels like a succession of disconnected combats: roll dice, roll dice, roll dice - because the combat is really basic and there is nothing besides. Which is a shame really, because the bits are very cute.

Heavily story driven D and D, co-op style game that could be for kids, but not specifically for kids. Story is great, mini's are great and the mechanics are solid. Tons of powers and upgrades for all 6 characters and a stack of encounters and differing scenarios will over tons of replay if this is your style of game. We found the rulebook a tad sporatic and clunky but once we figured everything out i dug this game and would very much play through a few more scenarios
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good game, but as a DnD player it is absolutely nothing special- basically just dumbed down 3.5 with a story already written for me.

Nephew and Niece love it, and it's probably a great gateway to pen and paper gaming.

RATING: 5
Story wise, this game is really cute.  And it's not a bad game, it just didn't feel like you had any meaningful choices to make.  You just do a battle in order to get to the next page in the story.  I found it to be much like Descent, so if you're a fan of one you'll probably enjoy the other.

It's my favorite game. The rules are simple and easy to get. Some people think the luck involved in the roll of the dice makes the game chaotic, but for me it makes the game even more fun. The history was well worked, an exception in this kind of game. Finally, the components have a great quality.

What a lovely game! Fantastic theme, me and my son both love the story element and the way that it's used, and we both got the mechanics down after a round or two. This is the perfect game to play with my family, especially my 7 year old who loves the theme. The components are stunning, and even though I don't particularly enjoy painting minis, I am tempted because they look so good. I can heartily recommend this splendid game.

This is SUCH a GREAT game. It's a mix of RPG, action/adventure, dungeon crawling, storytelling, etc. But it's a fairly simple game. Components are incredible. Love the artwork. Love the story line.

Since the review I've played one more chapter, so 10 games, 6 chapters. I also received the expansion via the pre-order and it looks great. I continue to be impressed with this game.

Here's the high level: If you enjoy co-op, a great story experience, really clever and meaningful scenario design, all of which wrapped around a nice little combat mechanic, then consider this game. It's a real treat with good friends.

A dungeoncrawler game that you can play with kids, with nongamers, and with gamers alike!

This game focuses on creating a thematic atmosphere instead of trying to be a perfect combat simulator. As a result, some rules feel unpolished and/or gamey, but this allows to have a fluid game with great atmosphere, quite good IA for the enemies and a few tense moments. And it doesn't need a DM!

It's great to have a game that does not try to be another Descent. Mice and Mystics can coexist with Descent in your collection.

A nice game for a night or two. Outstanding art, great story you want to follow, convincing characters, large variety of equipment and adventure cards. So why did I rate it only 6? Despite being overally appealing, Mice and Mystics really lacks built in interactions between players, some of its mechanisms seem not balanced enough and sometimes feels too random. Moreover, encounters quite quilcky get boring. However, if I was to introduce anyone to RPG I would definitely start with Mice and Mystics.

Played this game for the first time last weekend and can't wait to play it again.  My wife and I started a campaign and really enjoyed it.  I usually don't like the reading of stories etc during games, but this one really works well.  I feel like we are part of the unfolding story and can't wait to play the next chapter to see what happens.  

Just the fact that the environment is interactive is really neat and I like the option to do "side plots".

I love story centric, theme heavy games and great artwork. This game has all of those things. 

It's a fun, easy to play dungeon crawler. I loved it so much I even painted the minis (first time!). I would say that there are times when the game feels a bit too easy, but I think that allows you to really enjoy the story rather than be frustrated by insurmountable enemies. This is a good game to transition more casual players into dungeon crawlers.

Edit: Play 5-> Chapter 5 is pretty broken. Hunt around on the Plaid Hat forums for a fix. It did make the night a bit less fun than usual with MM.

Mice and Mystics is a great game for those looking into an introductory dungeon crawl with a really charming story. However, for those looking for a meatier game with deep character progression and a branching, complex story may feel underwhelmed by what M & M offers. 

I fall right in between. To me, Gloomhaven is the ideal Dungeon-Crawl/Fantasy/RPG/Character Progression BOARDGAME(I have to capitalize this, cause I know D&D exists) available on the market today, but it is quite an involved game. But its mechanisms and originality is why I think it's great, and games like Mice and Mystics or Descent or many other dungeon crawls just fall flat. 

I'll say it, I am not a fan of dice resolution for combat/blocking/movement etc. in longer games. Black Plague is sort of an exception, because it's not a serious game, heavy game. Chuck some dice, and kill zombies. However if you hate rolling dice constantly, you will hate M&M. You roll when you move, attack, defend , when enemies defend, resolving certain special scenario actions etc. M&M has too much dice rolling for my enjoyment. What's worse you can get stuck in a scenario because you can't kill this one annoying rat hindering progress because he keeps blocking your attacks. 

Listen I enjoy games with dice rolling, but they always need some sort of mitigation on the luck factor( like Roll for the Galaxy has), and my plays of this there was very little to none. Plus I didn't feel like my character was progressing/leveling up etc. 

But where I will give Mice and Mystics its due is in the story it tells, and the ease of play, for the most part. It is a good family game, that younger children can enjoy, as well as parents or young adults. For me, it's a bit simplistic for the style of game it is. I enjoy stupid simple games like Dixit, Bang! the dice game, Ticket to ride, etc. but I want more from my dungeon crawls.

Fantastic for younger players and for families (a facet sometimes overlooked by review community), but isn't so pollyanna to ruin it for seasoned gamers. Recommend picking up the audio recordings by actor Rich Sommer; good charity cause and certainly worth it. Easily one of the best games I have played in the last 5 years and one that deserves all the awards it has received.

This is everything that I'd hoped Castle Ravenloft would be!  It's Descent-light without the complex miniatures-combat rules and a nice storyline. Where Ravenloft (or Ashardolon, at any rate) was rather dry, this game had a very nice storyline to follow and it really seemed like the scenarios were different and there were various objectives which one could take somewhat seriously in the course of the game.  It's fun and I'd like to play further.

It's also the case that several of the protagonists, starting with Nez, somehow acquired Russian accents as we were playing, but I think that may have been a function of the people I was playing with.  (2 plays)

Very pretty, great components, and I could see where some would like this, but I felt like I didn't make any decisions and the game played me for 2.5 hours. It was obvious whom to attack and when to attack vs when to search or explore, so there really weren't "decisions" there although if you don't stop and think about it, you might not realize that. The only real decision is when to spend cheese / how to spend it, and that's not an every turn decision, so you wind up with many many turns on 100% autopilot. For me, I'd rather play a full RPG where I actually had meaningful choices.

The rules are make or break on this game - make sure you've got every nuance worked out or it will be like trying to fight an uphill battle.

For all the mousey thematic dressing (which is very well done), this is a straight-up blood-soaked (well, without any actual blood) dungeon crawl, which surprised me.  I thought here would be more puzzles and story and stuff.  It feels very much like a video game ported to a boardgame format; complete with a finite number of "extra lives" before you lose the game.

It also really difficult, unless I'm playing the combat rules wrong.

While the designers do a good job of varying the 11 scenarios included with the game; every new room (with a handful of exceptions) is a new battle, so each "Chapter is a succession of 6 or 7 battles against combinations of the same 5 or 6 enemy types, plus 4 bosses.

Currently finished Chapter 3 and it's already feeling kind of samey.

UPDATE: Having finished the base game I can say that this one was perfect to play with my kids, and is the Dungeons & Dragons game I wished I had had when I was in elementary school.  

I can't see this holding the interest of a group of adults, however, without house rules to either eliminate lots of combat or vary it significantly.

Beautiful production - and those miniatures are wonderful - but it's more of a strictly scripted activity than a game. It's a story with a game pasted on, a ritual, like some grim, totalitarian teddy bear's picnic with incidental dice rolling.

Putting hyperbole to one side for a moment: I had high hopes for this after reading many rave reviews. Nice production and an interesting theme hampered by odd design choices, clumsy rules, weird variable scenario player limits and generally tedious play. Looks great but fell completely flat for us.

Interested in a thematic co-op RPGish boardgame.  Love the idea of the "Redwall" type theme.

After waiting and watching for quite a while, pulled the trigger on an order through amazon.  I think Tina and I will really like it, I want to paint it, and I also want to take it to the Zylstra's for Thanksgiving.

Late 2013 - Working through the campaign with Barry, Jacqi, Tina, and me, and really enjoying it.  Eventually finished that campaign, but Barry & Jacqi moved before we could play with the expansion.

Now sitting on the game for the long wait until my kids are ready to play.

If its even simpler than Ravenloft than I am quite sure I don't need this in my collection, which also includes WHQ. 

Also seems very luck driven and lacking decisions so doesn't improve on either in that area apparently and could be worse. Probably aimed squarely at families with the theme and such and sounds quite good for the niche

The theme is great.  The first few times I played it, we always seemed to have new players and only ever played Chapter 1 (i.e. the intro scenario). Then a few of us decided to start a campaign and that meant playing the other chapters (in fact, we skipped Chapter 1 because we'd all played it so much). The rules aren't always clear--the rulebook prioritizes theme over clarity--but the designer has made official rulings on most of the ambiguities. And you're probably fine with whatever ruling you decide on your own if you don't want to track down the FAQs. The campaign rules do a pretty good job of providing a way to grow your characters without unbalancing it too much for the person who just wants to play the chapters in isolation.

RATING: 7
Wonderfully thematic game with great components. Gameplay is occasionally exciting and fun, but there's really a lot of rolling to attack, rolling to defend, rolling to move, etc.

As much as I like, no, *love* the premise of this game, the actual mechanics of gameplay seem to get in the way of my enjoyment sometimes... Still, the game is absolutely charming and I can't wait to explore further chapters in the story.

Played a few times with a playtest version.

It's rather different than both Summoner Wars and Dungeon Run, as well as most other "dungeon crawls" on the market.

It's a fun game to play with family and friends.  Bistro's writing, John Ariosa's art, and Jerry Hawthorne's design and setting mixed with simple mechanics really works if this is the kind of game you're looking for.  If you're no stranger to dice, want your game to tell a story and want a co-op, I recommend it.

If you want a tactical masterpiece or to see your foes driven before you, or want to play most efficiently all the time... you might not be reading this anywyay.

P.S.  Forgot Chad's minis.  Excellent.  Paint the centipedes and leave them in your wife's jewelry drawer.

For a cooperative game meant to be played with children, it sure can own you. We haven't been able to make it out to the tree in two plays (AKA- make it through the first chapter without dying).

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2013)

I was pleasantly surprised by the game, this is a familiar looking, dungeon crawler game. I would have never played it due to its theme, it just doesn’t call to me. After I played it I found it to be a little boring. However, it is a good game to play with some close friends. 

The components are great, the minis are very well done and they look gorgeous when painted (I will upload pictures of this). The rules are, relatively, simple so it is ideal to introduce new players or family to the hobby. The theme works well and the story is engaging. I would like to play all the scenarios with the same game group BUT I have other campaign games I want to play over this one (Descent, Gears of War, Earth Reborn, Risk Legacy) so perhaps this won’t see much play. 

I have played only the first scenario and it was fun but extremely easy, I really hope the game racks up the difficulty in later scenarios. 

It appears the game has a lot of luck, but as it is a light game I can live with that. I also like how each turn you have to shuffle the initiative track but that adds to the randomness.  

Bottom line, I prefer to play heavier games than this but it is a good light game to play with friends and family.

Current Rating: 6.5

As I´m currently reviewing my ratings, I can’t in good conscience give Mice & Mystics a rating higher than 5.0. The game is great looking, but the theme is in disagreement with my tastes AND it is way too simple for me.

I would consider it for my children if I had any. Desire to play M&M is very low.

A strange mix.  It's probably a little more complicated than Ravenloft but the theme is more appealing to my kids.  It's a nice niche.  The biggest problem is that I can't see my 9 yr old taking it off and playing it with his friends like I did with Heroquest.  Probably the best kids adventure game I've seen but that's a pretty specific niche.

Seems really light game. I would have to watch this getting played out sometime in order for me to get this.

After watching few play videos, I like it. But I remain skeptical about few things. 

1) would I be able to immerse myself deeply into this story? Yes, I do enjoy themes and stories but I also know that these cannot make up a game all by itself if it does not have any solid mechanisms to go with it. And from the past experiences, after few plays, I play games for mechanisms that they bring to the table, not the stories. If you take away story from M&M...what you are left with is just simple dungeon crawl with mice minis. 

2) controlling all 4 characters seems busy work for me who mainly plays games solo. 2 to 3 would be maximum unless there aren't that many components to manipulate like Elder Signs.

7/20/2014 - This is a neat little simple dungeon crawl with a really great accompanying story that adds a lot of flavor. The game play is arguably even a little too simplistic; it's not going to replace any of the great tactical minis games you might love. But if you play with younger folk, or anyone who is a fan of young adult fantasy (or Redwall or Watership Down), this might just be a good fit.

7/12/2015 - I'm dropping my rating because I honestly just don't have a lot of desire to play this, especially when stacked up against other coop dungeon crawlers like Gears of War or Galaxy Defenders.

2018-01-15 - And, I'm upping my rating back up from a 6 to a 7. This game has found new life for me as a good way to get to know my little, and his enthusiasm for the game and story have helped me appreciate it more.

RATING: 8.5
Ok, first of all, I don't know what people are talking about with quality issues, the tiles are great, minis are detailed, artwork is terrific. There may not be so many minis, but there is certainly enough for there to be something constantly going on. More variaty would be nice to have in an expansion ofcourse. The main part of the production has obviously gone into making it an immersive story experience, and at that it succeeds perfectly, where the D&D games (wich I also really enjoy) feels a lot more generic and random. They are perfect for beer and pretzels, this game is perfect for sitting with great people and playing through a story. Many people claim this is a kids game, and yes there is a substantial amount of luck involved, but no more than other crawlers like claustrophobia and descent, but the game can be really tough. The theme didn't scream kids game as much to me perhaps because cartoon mice makes me think of Maus more than Tom and Jerry. Mice and Mystics does not contain holocaust (I think. Haven't played all the way through yet, so maybe?)The game has lots of tactical descisions to be made and the mechanisms are a great frame for the story to unfold.

Simple dungeon crawl at its best. The story that the game provides elevates this game and makes it stand out. It gives you the feeling of playing the lead role in an interactive fairy tale of mice.

Mice and Mystics is a simple - almost too simple - adventure game with an incredibly appealing theme. If I was a deep fan of dungeon crawlers, I don't think the theme would be enough to compensate for the lack of interesting mechanics and rules. That said, my wife - who is not an experienced adventurer - likes the theme a lot and has little other experience to compare it to, so we've been moving through the campaign two-player and we are enjoying it. I had scored this an "8", but I think it more objectively deserves a 7. Not only are the rules a bit too simple, but they are not clearly laid out in the rule book, either.

Another reason I'm dropping this a point is because - although the story line is pretty good - the scenario intros and in-adventure text can include characters that are not in play for that adventure. This could have been avoided (and I believe they did fix this in Downwood Tales). It is distracting when the story uses characters that clearly are not present in the room when being read.

UPDATE: After completing 7 scenarios, my wife admitted that the mechanics aren't interesting and the story is not keeping her hooked. Dropped this another point and will sell. mechanically, the game really is a 5, I've decided, and there isn't enough variety. Gets a "6" though for the unique and appealing theme.

What it does well is presentation and creating a narrative.  the girls are into the story, but the gameplay itself is, unfortunately, just ok.  it is functional, and serviceable, but not much decision making going on in it... not nearly enough to remain interesting.  I like the idea od role play and hard decisions for the group to make as the story progresses, but other than the story and bits, im a bit let down.

Still, looking forward to going through the campaign with my girls... hoping it gets better from here.

Wow I honestly can't believe the hype surrounding this game because it just fell so flat with my group. I was really excited to play it; so excited in fact that I preordered it. Boy was I disappointed! I played it about 3 times and each time it actually got worse! 

Here's the main problem I have with this game. The ending of each play through is dictated completely randomly by the rolls of the enemies. Basically if they roll a cheese than it adds one cheese to the cheese wheel. Dying also causes the cheese wheel to fill up. If the wheel fills up a certain amount of times game over. I absolutely despise this mechanic. It makes the ending so arbitrary. We could all be doing so well and then all of a sudden just lose out of nowhere. 2 hours wasted because of randomness. Why couldn't they just make the round end after a certain amount of deaths. It just really ruins it for us. Sure we could just pretend it didn't happen but cheating on a coop game just feels lame and it should just work well out of the box.

Just to add on to the problems, there are very few different enemies and abilities so combat gets old quick. I really really really wanted to like it. I love the theme and think that Plaid Hat did a really good job with the production but the flaws really make this game a boring drag. Please try before you buy!

This is an RPG in a box. I have the same problem with it that I do with Eldritch Horror. I simply do not find the game play too interesting. The choices seem obvious as well as being fairly limited. There isn't enough dice mitigation for me. Since I personally feel that the younger audience is better suited for this sort of playing the hero than the age appropriate for Eldritch Horror, I approve of this more.

I simply love the artwork on the tiles, and appreciate the effort that went into making the movement spaces organically integrated into the art of the tile, rather than just doing lazy squares for grid combat.  The story and some of the battle mechanics are great...love that they came up with achievements that give you special bonuses.  I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to play this as I am sure she will have a blast.  I played this with my friends (late 20's) and brother (16) and we all had a good time, despite my reservations that the kid friendly theme might make the game seem dull (it didn't at all)

Because of the outstanding story and relatively simple mechanics, it's a great game to play with my 5 year old. I would never choose it for adult play but love it as a family play option.

Fall 2012...Just got it, looking forward to playing...

Late May 2014...After a year and a half, where other things and games kept getting in the way, I finally got started on M&M... I played a solo game, something I otherwise never do, to get a feel for the rules before playing with my game group... I flipped through the rules a lot, but got the hang of it, and though I made a couple of small mistakes here and there, it wasn't anything really unbalancing the game... I played the first chapter, did the Miz Maggie side plot, and managed to haul a group of wounded mice to the hole in the tree, just two cheeses away from a game ending surge... GREAT GAME!

Early June 2014... Just bought the two lost chapters from PHG, and the promo cards from the BGG store... Looking very much forward to Downwood Tales...

September 2015... I have Heart of Glorm and Downwood Tales as well. Have given up on ever playing this with my Thursday gaming group, as campaign style games are not really suitable for that... But plan to start playing with my daughter this weekend...

And so we did! Well worth the three year wait! Playing with Emma, at age six was a blast! Two characters each, and we played through the entire first chapter in one go, and she can't wait to play again... 
First weekend we played Capters one and two, and are halfway through Chapter three...

A simplified tabletop RPG with beautiful artwork and good quality pieces.  It's definitely not a deep TTRPG and has several rule ambiguities, but if you're looking for a light, hack-n-slash adventure this is a solid choice.  Also, family friendly if you're trying to infect the younger generation.  :)

A very cute and fun coop that provides a great story (especially for a board game). The miniatures are very nice. The game is mostly luck based, so that can be a problem (it took me five plays to get over chapter one).

Ideally, you want four players, the game simply works best that way. I've mostly played with one other player, though, and that was nice, but the one game I had with four players was superb.

Thematic, with a narrative that draws you in.  The protagonists are loyal defenders of the king, on the run fom a svengali queen who has taken over the kingdom.  They escape imprisonment through a magic spell that transforms them into mice.  Ok, start the dungeon crawl, but you're only a few inches tall.

Lots of color, with well designed scenarios in a narrative arc.  Not sure about replayability.  Also I would have preferred a few more types of enemies (and am not thrilled with those roaches- a phobia from my urban years?)

Immersive, challenging, and mice-loads of fun (hmm, that sounds wrong somehow).

So far my favorite story-driven dungeon crawl. Brought it out expecting a light family affair...a nice break from cube crunching and dude shooting. Turns out to be a hugely entertaining and captivating game...with real and important cooperative decision making (still lots o' luck involved in encounters and dice, but it feels like the right amount of luck).

The only thing that keeps it from a 10 is the fact that the rules are poorly laid out and some crucial rules are only included in the FAQ.

A game entirely based on dice rolling and luck. Really love the theme and the lore, but scenarios take way too long and is too reliant on luck for my taste. I remember having to constantly consult the rulebook as well as there are lots of technical, fiddly things that came up throughout. I really wish I enjoyed playing it more often as it's a great gateway into RPGs, basically like a DnD-lite.

This game is my girlfriend's favorite. She begs me to play it every night. I love the theme, the mechanics and the feel. However, after around 7 chapters, the game feels samy because of the lack of diversity (mostly in the ennemies). Once you finish the game, you likely won't want to play it again before a long time. This is still an awesome buy

Great quality components (mice minis are great!) such as solid, colorful board tiles, clear easy to read rulebook and an immersive storyline that makes you want to keep exploring means this fun strategy game is a solid must have.

Truly fantastic little thematic game. Simple combat, great little story and creative and fun items and characters. Highly addictive. 

There are a lot of complaints about holes in the rule book and house rules being the law of the land. It took a few sessions and references to BGG forums but after a couple few chapters we just said "well, let's put ourselves into the context of the game, what makes sense here?" and way more often than not it felt right and the game carried on nicely.

CRITIQUE OF MICE & MYSTICS
I have a brief review of Mice & Mystics [thread=958027]here[/thread].

Given my long history with roleplaying games (going back to 1979), I had high hopes for Mice & Mystics. The components looked great, the story-based play seemed immersive, and it was from the same publisher that produced Summoner Wars! Unfortunately, the game did not live up to my high expectations.

Gameplay in M&M is frustrating and tedious. It's frustrating because the rulebook is poorly written, with no examples of play, and this interferes with the players' immersion in the story. Read the flavor text to start an adventure, equip your mice, and start playing, then... "Wait! How does that rule for switching weapons work again? Oh, the rulebook is ambiguous? Better take a break while checking BGG forums for the answer." In the meantime, any sense of immersion is lost.

It's also frustrating because there is no way to mitigate the luck that dominates the game. Admittedly, the custom dice are very well done, but everything in the game is decided by rolling them. The gameplay in M&M works like this: roll dice to move, roll dice to attack, roll dice for defense, roll more dice to move, roll more dice to attack, roll more dice to defend, etc. Oh, and occasionally you get to roll dice to search... if you have time. You get the idea. It quickly become a tedious exercise in passing the dice tray back and forth between us.

For a game that we all wanted to love, it is incredibly disappointing that we all find ourselves relieved when we complete a chapter. We aren't satisfyingly relieved that we completed the mission, we are just glad that the game is over, because the game is just one tedious combat after another. And the game forces you to kill every enemy on a tile before you can move on! Often, combat will cause a surge to happen and even more enemies appear. We didn't hate surges because they made the chapter more difficult; we hated them because they led to more tedious combat. By the game's end we have all had it. Two hours of this is more than enough.

There's no doubt that M&M can be challenging, but like an old-school RPG it's challenging because of what you roll rather than how you play. Roll too much cheese for the wheel and more enemies appear. Roll well on your enemies' defense and they become harder to kill. Roll poorly on your movement and you can't get to them quickly enough. But none of these are actually choices you make. The game makes these decisions for you. There are precious few decisions to be made, because the stories are linear and there is really only one thing each mouse can do.

The rulebook is inadequate in some crucial places, and you have to find answers to very basic questions either on BGG or by watching video walkthroughs. But the thing that finally sunk the game for me was the fact that the game's designer frequently responded to questions about the rules using the words, "technically yes, but..." In other words, even the game's designer isn't sure how the game is supposed to be played. This should just never happen with a board game.

The one place this game shines is in its theme, but even this is flawed. The enemies are too few, and their scale makes no sense. Why is a cockroach nearly as tough as a rat? How can the mice fight Brody the cat at all? For a game that prides itself on a well-integrated theme the way that theme is applied seems sloppy. And of course it's difficult to stay connected with the story when every action you take feels exactly the same.

I have no idea why this game made it into the top 100 here, because for us it was a major disappointment.

Mice and Mystics for trade. Very good quality. Played 5 times. I LOVE the art and was hooked on the story, but the gameplay was a chore. My copy has a few small defects that were there when I removed the shrink. The edges of a few of the cards are scuffed, one rat warrior's arm is slightly popped out of its joint, and a few of the boards have some light surface damage from the miniatures banging into them in the box during shipping. I do have an extra set of board tiles, as well as laminated search tokens (a fanmade addition to help keep track of searching). I will also email you PDF copy of the first downloadable chapter, which i purchased before my copy of the game arrived.

I am only 2 chapters in. I am a big fan of the artwork and components. I enjoy the story book vibe of it as well as the little narrative breaks in between gameplay. Each character feels unique in their available abilities as well, which for any RPG is a must for me. Even with all these pluses there is just something about the game that just hasn't completely hooked me yet. 

I think it is the fact that there is no DM. On paper I thought this was a huge plus. This means that you can play it solo and no one is stuck DMing if they don't want to. But to me, in practice, it makes the game feel a little less tight and overall less fun. For starters it means that enemy behavior is completely predictable. The only variability is going to be their dice rolls. I mean, the system they have set up with the initiative track, custom dice and system for enemy behavior certainly works. It just all seems a little bit "meh" to me.

This game is a solid dungeon crawler with an imaginative theme and a great story. Any fan of DnD and Redwall/Mouseguard will instantly love this. I am currently through the first three chapters of the game and I am surprised of how difficult this game can be even with its cute furry theme. The game is challenging, engaging, and exciting. Everything that I look for in a dungeon crawler. Component quality is good. Miniatures look great. Cards and bits are on par. The custom dice are great. Tiles feel heavy and showcase great attention to detail art. One of my biggest gripes with this game is that it caps at 4, and could have easily been scaled for more. Quests can take a little longer than what it feels like, but overall there is much more to like here than dislike. One that I will be playing for a while.

This is such a beautiful game, but the story aspect did not appeal to me. This is the type of game that you need to play with the same group from beginning to end.

Dangit, I really want to like this game.  In theory I love it.  The quests, the story, the adventure, the coop, the minis, the searching for treasure (such as it is), etc.  But in the end, it feels like the whole game just comes down to simple dice rolls.  I've been almost to the end, and all of a sudden the rolls go poorly, and the whole game was wasted because I rolled some freakin cheese for a rat.  Now I have to do that Chapter over.  Again.  Also my centipede mini broke, and now all the others feel flimsy.  

But dangit, I'll still give it an 8.

I was really looking forward to the German release of this game, because I wanted to play this with children, so a foreign version was out of the question. I was hoping for it to be some kind of "HeroQuest Junior", but after finally obtaining it the day it got released and playing it for the first time, I soon realized this game was too hard for most children. I liked the cooperative nature of it, but wished there was more diversity in creatures. The story of the campaign was great, but gameplay was a little less exciting than I had hoped for. Ultimately it was a race against the time, just like Descent 2nd Edition, but at least we felt less pressed for time than in an average Descent session.
I think this is a good game overall, with very cute and detailed hero minis, but unfortunately it couldn't really live up to my high expectations.

Mice and Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle's housecat, Brodie. Mice and Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to hoard the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.

RATING: 6.6
This is a pretty good game in its genre. Too bad this is not my genre. Most games like this (dungeon crawlers with simple dice roll battles) are too long for what they are, too much of them are about going somewhere and rolling numbers that are not good for anything (and, unlike in the Hobbit game above, you can't do anything with these bad rolls but suffer the consequences; you have way more turns but many of them aren't really interesting at all). At least this one has a cute theme, some fun small ideas and a story that makes all this better - a bit. I can see this game is good for those who like this genre; I just start to learn these games aren't really for me. More about it here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/21779

We tried this 3 times to give it a good chance, with different characters.  It's just boring, simple and annoying.  All we ended up doing every time we played was pretty much stand in one place and throw dice.  It also has an annoying mechanism where the bad guys get to defend.  Yay I finally got a hit!!  Oh wait, they defended...  I literally didn't get one hit during the first half hour of our third game, and I had good characters with lots of abilities...  Even with more abilities and enough cheese to play them the game is just boring and tedious.  It has a lot of mechanisms just to "make it work" such as the annoying "you can't leave a room until you kill all the enemies", which turns the game into a series of 1)enter a room, 2)fight (boring fight) 3) move a tiny bit, then 4) leave...  This is a good game for very young kids, and that's about it.

Storybook driven game that takes quite a bit of time to play.  Luck-centric mechanism because of dice slows the game down quite a bit.  However, it is worth it to play through the stories with the little mice that you fall in love with.

RATING: 6
Well, maybe I'll hold off on selling it yet.  Finally had a play that felt fairly smooth to play without constantly consulting the rules for answers that weren't present!  :-)  Moved the rating back up to a 6.

================================================

A second time around with the game is causing me to rethink many of my previous statements.  I think that playing this with experienced gamers may not work well - the lack of rule clarity is annoying as hell and detracts seriously from the enjoyment of the game.  The rule book is atrocious and even the FAQ is not always helpful.  I've about had it with this game and reduced the rating to a 5.  Probably won't be long until I sell the game.

================================================

Enjoyable and light dungeon crawl but with mice and a lighter story line.  (Think Redwall!)  There are some rule questions that frequently came up but have largely been resolved.  Each mouse has different abilities and starting armor/weapons so each character does play differently.  The timing mechanism can be aggravating if one rolls lots of cheese on the monster attack/defense rolls.  Plays fairly quickly once you get the hang of your choices.  Game play does start being repetitive fairly quickly though...

Not finished all the chapters yet but so far it's enjoyable. I like the story and how it unfolds and the art and components are amazing. But I can't say that I feel particularly challenged playing it (so far at least). It doesn't seem that there are that many decisions to be made for the most part and the dice bring in quite a heavy luck component.

Enjoyed this game quite a bit with my boyfriend. It's simple, beautiful and has a great story to follow. 

The game is probably best at 4 (played it once at 4) there is a lot less to manage.

At 2, you need to control most of the time 2 mice each. Sometimes there are scenarios with 6 mice. So the level of confusion grows. 

My gripe about the game is that the later scenarios tile laying don't always make sense. Certain rooms are unclear how you could end up there. Quite often, we would need to check on bbg for answers.

Otherwise a great game.

First of all, this game is certainly not for everyone. If you are not into the rich story or the unique theme, this game is a fairly run of the mill dungeon crawl (or at least of the co-op variety). However, for those who do like reading the flavor text this game's story arc immerses you deeply into the theme (although the great artwork and the scenarios having a bit more variety than say Castle Ravenloft doesn't hurt either). Furthermore, there are very few good anthropomorphic animal games out there, especially ones without silly artwork.

I really like how they did leveling up with this game. It allows you to have the feeling that your character is growing without making playing in a non-campaign mode too much of a disadvantage. Also, death (captured) is a good balance of making you feel like you are losing your character (since you lose equipped items) without making you twiddle your thumbs for the rest of the game (your mouse can respawn after the current fight is over).

While most adventures require you to play 4 mice, I have not had too much trouble playing this as a 2 player or solo experience besides lapsing on minor scenario-specific rules.

The basic rules I feel are simple enough for a child or nongamer to learn but you definitely need someone who knows what they're doing for the more specific stuff.

I wish the strategy level of this game was a bit higher. The main optimizations seem to involve positioning of your mice (healing has a pretty short range in this game, but you can also kite enemies if you spread out more) and cheese management depending on your team, besides a few more minor things. However, I feel like a lot of time strategy is overridden by luck. This especially seems the case if you get a lot of cheese added to the cheese wheel early, as not only do you have to deal with surges, but the minions you will face will be more difficult due to the increased chapter number, creating a snow ball effect.

A dungeon, adventure game where the characters are mice and there is a story built around the game.  It is a very well written story and you fight rats, cockroaches, spiders and other "boss" monsters like the cat.  

However the game is really complex for kids.  At least one adult has to be a gamer as the game rules can be fiddly with a number of exceptions.  There scenarios are really hard, which can be very disappointing for young children.  Another issue is that combat becomes repetitive.  This game is a good example of the Dice Tower over-hyping a game.  

Having said all this, it is a solid game and if you insulate your kids from the complexity, you will have a good time.

RPG-lite-in-a-box.  Evocative storytelling and random events and items provides decent replay value.  Being a cooperative adventure game, it is not the greatest in meaningful decision making and strategizing, but the cheese wheel provides sufficient Pandemic-style tension to keep it interesting.

Great with kids!  Definitely look forward to playing through all eleven chapters.  7 down and 4 to go!  Update:  Finished the first set and down to the last chapter in Glorm.  Looking forward to Downwood!

It is a game wrapped around a story.  The gameplay itself is rather shallow, simplistic, and very luck driven.  There is a minimal sense of progression, and some of the limited number of character skills are not particularly exciting.  The game also tends to last too long for its lack of depth and player choice.

The components are incredible, the story is cute, and it all works thematically.  You will get your money's worth out of it playing with kids who do not mind heavy repetition of gameplay and of encounters.  Losing a chapter after an hour+ of gameplay to just have to trudge through that chapter again - which will play out rather similarly - is not fun for most adults.

We played as much as we did only so we could make our way through some of the storyline, and, ultimately, we just couldn't take it anymore.  The gameplay could not sustain our interest.  There are better co-operative games with more tension and more teamwork, and there are better dungeon crawlers of both co-operative and versus varieties.  Frankly, there are better story-driven games and games which create or embrace a personal or group narrative.  Ultimately, really, the story and cuteness which holds up the game is out-matched by a single Redwall novel or Mouse Guard comic, and they take a heck of a lot less time to enjoy.

Before buying this game, you will have to decide, if you want to play it with your adult friends or with your kids.

If you want to play this with your friends, just don't:
this is by far the dullest coop dungeon crawler I have played thus far, and I have played quite a few.

EVERYTHING you do is decided by dice rolling or other forms of randomness. you want to move? roll a die to determine your speed. you want to search? roll a die to see if you find something. oh, you found something? draw a card to see if it is good or bad. you want to get out of the water? roll a die to see if you succeed. you want to fight? roll the dice (ok, this one is in every dungeon crawler.) you rolled a cheese symbol on an enemies attack? put a cheese token on the wheel (cheese tokens on the wheel may end your game quite soon, so whether you win or loose can also be decided by randomness!!! what?! YES!!!)

the AI is dull, like in every other coop dungeon crawler, but this one manages to make it even duller. you are actually forced to kill every monster in a room before you are allowed to advance into the next one. meaning, all you do in a room is roll dice for combat. you don't even have to move actually, because the monster will move towards you anyway and positioning is completely irrelevant, too, so why bother moving?!?! oh, and if you are looking for monster variation, you will not find it here, because there are maybe 4 or 5 different types, which makes everything even more boring.

hands down, if you have ever played and loved descent or even simpler games like dungeons and dragons: castle ravenloft (and those others), then you should run away from this one, because it is DULL. did I say that already? Well, it is.

if you want to play this with your kids:
the above criticized simplicity is obviously not a big deal, since it must be simple enough for kids to understand and play. 

also, the theme and the story are a plus-point for kids. 

however, even for kids the cheese-wheel is a deal breaker in my eyes. why they implemented this mechanic is beyond me. as soon as you have rolled too many cheese symbols, you loose the game. so even, if your heroes are all still well and healthy the game is over. I find this very annoying.

another thing is that heroes can be captured by the enemies (also randomly). this means, you have to wait and skip your turn for as long as you are rescued again or the game is over. this certainly is not fun for kids.

overall, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.

Generous rating after several chapters.  Excellent presentation and story.  The game itself is weak.  Constant rolling of dice with random results constantly viewed.  Seems like the game would've benefited from more varied dice to try to offset the wild crazy randomness.  A lack of player aids is a bummer.  Just a good game not great.  Probably would've rated it a 5 on gameplay alone.  Pretty surprised at how high this is on the BGG rankings (like Eclipse), considering the very high level of randomness. Also, there is very limited player control of anything at all. I guess it is a good introductory game for people who want that.

Somehow I do not really understand the hype about this game.

The game is beautiful and very thematic. It's great as a storytelling device, but the gameplay itself… Well… Very repetitive, a bit random, pernickety, and the players don't have that many actual decissions, really. And over seventy pages of not very well written manual. (And the fact that there's so much manual and so little game makes it frustrating). Probably a thorough streamlinig of rules would have done the game much good. As it is now – I cannot see it having any replayability beyond playing the campaign once.

Score is after only one play.  Components are absolutely first rate, but I just didn't find the game terribly compelling.  There are very few decisions to make, combat is bland, and I just felt pulled through the story rather than playing a character who develops the story.

If not for the truly excellent components, I would rate this game a 2.  I'll never play it again.

This game almost makes me want to turn in being a crazy old cat lady for some kids. It takes something like the D&D dungeon crawls and turns them on their heads into something adorable, thematic and elegantly designed that tells great stories. It has dice, so there is some luck, and if you don't pay attention to the cheese wheel time can run out. There is a limited diversity to the monsters, hoping the new expansion adds some monsters and minis.

Beautiful game. My group enjoyed the fist chapter but lost interest by the second chapter. The new ness and novelty wear off quickly. Needs more options for character specialization. 

It's also hard to get to the table because of the low player count...

After playing more games of this style I have to realize they just don't work with my gaming group. No one wants to dedicate this much time to gam game with so few meaningful choices. We failed the second mission 2 times in a row because of random dice rolls!

Wonderful dungeon crawler to play with kids, even quite young ones.  Great mashup of HeroQuest style gameplay with a similar setting as Mouse Guard.  The mechanics are a little clunky and fiddly here and there, but as a game that is one part adventure-storytelling and one part tactical battle, it works quite well.  

I don't think I'd ever play this with a group of adults, but as a game to play with kids, it's wonderful.

Great Story and Art work. But very random and no real interesting decisions to make, the dice can cause instant death, Also a lot of ambiguous wording keeps the rulebook constantly and in hand and BGG forums being looked up over and over to solve dispute. 

CONCLUSION: Would be a nice light family game I guess. Also you've gotta be really into the theme or you'll hate dieing and losing a lot. NEEDS PLAYER AIDS

The trouble with Mice and Mystics is all that it [i]could have[/i] been.  The interactivity of the story book had me wanting a choose your own adventure style campaign but instead left us just playing the same chapters again until we got to the next page the way the game wanted us to.  The storybook theme, which drips wonderfully from the game, pushed me to want the gameplay to be less fiddly and have the smoothness, almost sing-songy cadence of a children’s book.  Even the story itself was a bit lackluster compared to similar attempts in other media to capture the melancholy potential of the bed time story.  Were it not for all the “[i]could haves[/i]”, the game could have been something very special instead of just polite.  Here is hoping the expansions seize the greater potential in the format.

Great game with a great story, it lets me feel like a little child again. Relatively simple rules. If played like an adventure game should be played can be oustanding. Hoever if someone can't seem to get into the story and focuses on the simplicity and randomness that the presence of dice delivers - will not be as good and will probably collect dust. Recomended for kids with patience and adults with imagination.

What a fun little game! Story based fairy tale with simple mechanics, but enough interesting choices.  It's wonderfully evocative artwork and adorable mice minis immerse you in the theme.

For me the story elevates Mice and Mystics above Castle Ravenloft (which I traded many moons ago).  Both are fairly predictable dungeon crawls, but when you play Mice and Mystics you feel like you're on a grand adventure.  The artwork is wonderfully evocative and the minis are adorable. There's no other game quite like it so I think it definitely earns a spot in any gamer's collection.  At least it does in mine.

I was very excited to play this as a family game with my wife, 6 year old son, and 9 year old daughter.  It is definitely being enjoyed by the kids and the story aspect is awesome.  I love the art and the overall component quality, but the gameplay itself really hasn't grabbed me and my wife just barely tolerates it.  It has pretty standard, simple miniatures mechanisms to move and attack, so there's really nothing new there.  The special ability cards generally don't seem to add much to the game other than slightly modifying your odds, so the variety in actions is fairly low.  We've only played through a few chapters so far but we've had to divide each one into multiple play sessions, so the overall progress feels a bit slow.  On the whole I think the story element and theme are what really make this game work.  Based purely on gameplay I don't think there's anything new or exciting here and, as such, this is not something I would offer to bring out with a group of 'gamers'.

A good addition.

Nice artwork and I like how the different board regulate movement in various different manners.  The characters are a bit generic, but the storytelling aspect was a nice effort, even if the amount of text can be surprisingly long.  The miniatures are ok for miniatures.  Lots of items available to find which adds some interesting variety.  Battles are pretty fun but the game overall lists perhaps a half hour longer than it should.  Still, nice atmosphere and storyline was interesting enough for me to be interested in what comes next.

This game is oozing with theme and is one of the best modern dungeon crawls out there now. 

All in all very enjoyable game where artwork and components are superb, story is good, characters are well in balance and fun to play, rules and mechanics simply work and there is no player elimination to leave anyone simply watching the "rest of the game".

Simply awesome.

It's an alright game. I need to play it some more. The "story" is there, but it's nothing more than a book, in my opinion. It would probably serve as a decent introduction to RPGs, but I would rather play a full blown RPG where I feel ownership towards my character. This game does have really nice minis which is a plus for my girlfriend.

After some more playing, it's too light and long making it a rather tedious game to play. I'd like to get rid of it, but my girlfriend likes it.

Complex rules, simple mechanics. It took going through two chapters and several trips to the forums to get a feel for rules that weren't so straight forward. It is great to play with the wife who like the theme & co-op. Plus, she is enjoying painting the figures. 

Update: This doesn't really see much table time. I think that if I had some older nieces/nephews that it might get more play, but as it is, two adults just aren't captivated by it that much.

Update 2: My sister is staying with us for a while and this got some table time. We were able to go through 5 chapters so far, and everyone is getting into their characters. It has been a real enjoyable experience.

The rules are mildly complex and definitely need a grown up to play it with children close to the bottom age range (8 years old).

That said the game balances the complex rules with a great story and lovely components and actually pulls it off. If I have one complaint is that 2 hours game duration is a bit on the long side, at least for us, which limits the number of times we can play it.

RATING: 8
I don't like the current trend of games costing more than the average price. 

This said MnM is well worth it:

While you don't get a lot of models they are very well done (Centipede is particularly excellent) with unique models for each mouse a major bonus. Unique art on most cards and heavy duty tiles and chits also adds to this deserved price tag. Just a stunning production. Children and easily excitable gamers will wet themselves.

Possibly not the most elegant game design ever but thematically a masterpiece. Wonderful story and magical items that'll warm those initially cold to the setting. 

Gameplay wise it's a dungeon crawler with all the usual limitations that this brings. If you want the tactically deepest dungeon crawler then its probably descent, the most elegant and best bang for your buck Claustrophobia but if you want a solid dungeon crawler that's readily accessible, with very strong theme, campaign elements, very high production values and like the idea of mice or a setting that's not the same old fantasy- this is it.

Campaign complete. 

The story writing is excellent, unlike most fantasy fluff garbage out there. The mechanics are extremely simple and a little repetitive but there are just enough decisions to be made most of the time. Some scenarios are either extremely easy or extremely hard, which always makes you think you're doing something wrong, and the rules don't do the game justice in this regard. Overall a very good game to play with a younger group.

Great game.  The kids love it, I love it, a neighbor kid has gotten hooked ... the wife hates it (as she does all games).

It just works.  We've somewhat enjoyed another dungeon crawler but we've become immersed in this one.  It is not uncommon for it to be the topic of discussion at the dinner table.  

Looking forward to what else comes out for Mice & Mystics in the future.  I could see us playing this system for many years to come.

My brother and I started playing this game after we decided Descent 2.0 and Imperial Assault were too heavy for us. Mice and Mystics was perfect. A light dungeon crawl that we can play in 90 mins (per chapter). We are playing the second expansion now, and it makes the game even better. I can't wait for my kids to be a little older so that I can play with them as well. Painting the miniatures (at least the Heroes) made it more fun too.

Great theme, beautiful components, wonderful storytelling elements in a charming world. Unfortunately, the game suffers from the randomness of the combat and surge system, making some sessions a laughably easy stroll through the park and others a miserable slog through a swamp of despair, where it feels like nothing you do matters. 
Highly recommend reading the story and dialogue in silly, melodramatic mouse voices to get into the spirit of the thing. Never imagined I could feel so horrifically threatened by the presence of a cat or a crow.

This is a very good game to play with kids. I am not so sure it works with adults only due to  too much dice action. But for kids its a top winner.

RATING: 8
Fun game with lots of theme.  I have to agree with some criticisms that it is too luck-based.  A run of good or bad luck can kind of ruin the fun, and starting the chapter over again is tedious (and a bit problematic if in a campaign -- advise to remember how mice were geared at the start of that chapter and reset to that point if you fail).

Maus & Mystik ist ein kooperatives Brettspiel, in dem die Spieler verwunschene Mäuse in einem fantastischem Setting verkörpern. Das Spielmaterial, die Miniaturen und das Artwork sind ohne Frage fantastisch! Die Geschichte, die in der Kampagne erzählt wird, ist bis ins kleinste Detail ausgearbeitet und entführt die Spieler in eine stimmige Fantasywelt. Auf spielerischer Seite konnte mich Maus & Mystik nicht ganz überzeugen. Die Missionen sind meiner Meinung nach sehr generisch, die Gegner keine große Herausforderung. Für Eltern mit Kindern sehr gut geeignet!

Este juego es precioso! Realmente es uno de los Dungeon Crawlers donde la historia te acompaña y sientes que eres parte de ella, no es un simple salir y matar! Todo tiene sentido, los quesos, el avance del tiempo, en este caso de las páginas del juego. La mecánica es buena pero no tanto como su tema, que si es lo mejor que tiene. Esto es para jugarlo con tus hijos o hermanos menores, les va a encantar.

I thought a lot before rating this one, but in the end, I have to say it did not catch up with my family, despite the gorgeous miniatures, oozing with theme and narrative story. The issue seems to be related to repetitive mechanics for dice based monster melee, that is tiring, and some unbalance where luck can destroy well played chapters. 

The story is nice and breaking rules seem to be a way of improving a bit the experience for kids. But game complexity and kids theme are not a good match. 

This game may work with kids if Dungeon Mastered by an adult and rule bent to improve chapter flow.

I feel like I have played too little of this one. I love how thematic it is. The combat, which is way too simple, can feel like grinding at times, but the components, story and overall feel make up for it. 

I love how this plays well with children and adults alike, provided they want to immerse themselves and maybe roleplay a little. 

Overall I would really like to love it, but having played only the first scenario many times with different groups all I can say is that the grinding part is really taking over the rest.

5 years of extensive DnD sessions, may have "burned" most Dungeon Crawler games, but from time to time, some of them can give something new and different. Mice and Mystics, is not about deep strategies and a bag full of monster miniatures. It is a great theme-based, storytelling, co-op game with light rules, that let you enjoy the heart of the game, which is its great story. Could play anytime, with the right group, that likes to play the games in-character. Also I can imagine this one as a great game for children, as one that can keep them hanging on for the rest of the story after each mission of its fantastic Campaign.

Fully cooperative dungeon crawler that works just as well solo as it does with other people. One of the best stories in a game I've ever seen. The chapters can be limiting on the number of players you can play with, which means you'll have to adjust the difficulty when introducing more players. A drag to be sure, but not a big one.

RATING: 6
Better than I expected it to be. The rules are a little convoluted...not to mention nebulous here and there...and the game does suffer from low variation beyond playing the scenarios, but the game is actually pretty fun. The characters feel different, there's nice variety with items and skills, and there are enough enemies to not feel like they're too repetitive. I don't think it's one I would ever go out and buy, but I can see how it works well as a family game. My only major complaint is that you can be playing an hour-long scenario and lose completely out of the blue. This is a bit anti-climactic, but at least the game isn't a cake walk, I suppose. Pretty fun, but nothing amazing.

RATING: 9.5
Really neat RPG-type campaign game.  There are just a couple minor issues: 1) We are finding we need to buy additional pieces to keep the game on track.  For example, the "search" action is only valid for one successful search per mouse per room.  In order to keep track of who has successfully searched a room (2 players playing with 2 mice each), we had to add buttons to the game container.  We have noticed the same issue with the cheese - if someone becomes the Cheesemaster, it burns through a lot of cheese really quickly; 2) rules are laid out in a way that are a little difficult to follow. Would benefit from crib sheets.
Hoping that there will be an expansion that adds a fifth player option soon.

This one gets a big "meh". Not so sure what people are gushing about. Nice components, like the emphasis on storytelling, but the main notion of the theme is so limited. How often are you going to go back and play this game? I played it once, and all of us were fine with ending the game right where we were, as another game was starting up. There was no tension, no real excitement - nobody cared.

After one play today with my wife and daughter I can say the game play is a little on the fiddly side, but it is the first time I have ever played a dungeon crawl type game so that may be par for the course. After a while though we go a hold of it and got on a roll. It does seem close to impossible to complete the side quest though, but I think I may have been playing a rule wrong when I was doing the movement between the tiles.

Art work is gorgeous, story is engaging, my daughter who is only 5 cared so much about her little mouse figure and that was great to see. My wife, who is not a gamer, even got into the spirit of the game to a certain extent which was great to see. She may have just been humouring me though as I know it is definitely not her thing.

Any way. I like it. Possibly love it enough to overlook its occasional clunkiness. I am not sure how to streamline the clunk out of it though so I think it is as good as it could be.

8.5 after the first play through, will see how they go from there.
_______

Lack of decisions is hurting this game for me. Also, the realization that it really needs to be played like a Legacy game, same group, save your spot and continue. Do not restart each time otherwise you will never get anywhere.

Just finished a second attempt at Chapter 4 in a campaign with a work mate. We have really enjoyed the game, even though we have lost more often than we have succeeded. The dice are evil though. I am convinced.

Storytelling and rpg'ing is great. But it's way too long for a family game and there's so many annoying "please roll the dice, it's your turn to move... okay now roll again if you want to do something..." My kids absolutely loved it though, they'd give it a 10.

Onto the wish-list with this one.  We played the first scenario with some chap called Richard who was learning the game with us, and had some helpful pointers from the friendly bloke who actually owned the game and was photographing the event.  Though we took a while to get going and learn the rules, we beat the adventure with one 'page' to go and it was a great, fun, easy to play (once you know how!) coop dungeon crawler which will be a fantastic fit for families playing with their children and reminded me strongly of the book Redwall, which I think I read when I was about 8 or 9 so I only remember in vague terms.  We skipped over the story segments for brevity, but these will really help flesh out the experience for families playing together.  Lovely minis, tiles and components too.

In this cooperative dungeon crawl game, players are mice, attempting to defeat monsters while trying to achieve the victory conditions for a particular scenario.

What makes this game unique are the humorous items in the game, such as getting cheese, meeting rats and the various items the mice can search for and pick up. 

This game is enjoyble for a light hearted game, and you could play with kids. It's one of those games where you read the scenario word for word to enjoy the theme of being turned into a mouse. There is luck with the dice rolling, and appears to be more so than other dungeon crawl games. If you want a little deeper game, consider Legends of Andor.

I volunteer for Big Brothers Big Sisters and this game has been a huge hit with my Little. He is a heavy video gamer and particulary enjoys RPGs. Most board games I have introduced him to he didn't mind but this one he loves and is always asking to play. This game is mostly a story with breaks of combat which you play out. The theme and story is great. The game is also easy to teach.

I would recommend this game to anybody who likes reading and campaigns. Avoid this game if you need to play explicitly by the rules as the game designer intended for house rules and rules interpretations.

My wife is really enjoying the story - which we are digesting one tile at a time (per session).  This is a great game for family gaming and can involve all types and ages of family members.  The designer, Jerry Hawthorne, is active on the BGG boards - and is always offering comments, advice, and especially encouragement.  M&M is a classic dungeon crawl with heaps of character and theme.

There's a lot to like about this game, from the art, to the theme to the story. Overall it's a great game. But, for me it suffers in a few areas that just brings the rating down:

1. The base game doesn't offer a lot of variety in enemies.
2. The dice rolling can be frustrating. I have a tendency to lose all my mice very easily and lose the chapter mission.
3. The rules is clunky or confusing in places requiring regular rulebook checks or looking things up on BGG (especially since each chapter may have new rules to follow). This is made especially difficult by the absence of any quick reference sheets.

Overall the rules are much too obtuse for the type of game it is. This is a problem with games that want to be really thematic. They require so many rules and side cases, that nothing is intuitive.

I'm up to Chapter 5 and REALLY enjoying it.  SO glad I made the trade.  Love the way you can end a turn and walk away for the night.  It is complex, but nicely doable.

----- Preliminary thoughts -----
It's very similar to the D&D boardgames (Castle Ravenloft, etc.), simpler but with a better story (special for kids!), even better art, less monsters, custom dice and a couple of different mechanics.

There are a couple of great things about this game:
-> Components are amazing, moderls are great and art is fantastic. Even the manual is beautiful. 
-> The whole game revolves about the story: there is a story book with the chapters; onve they are over, the game doesn't seem to have great replayability.
-> The mechanic for rolling cheese is very attractive, but I guess you will get tired of it quite soon.

It seems there are not enough reasons to buy the game (considering I already have the 3 D&D games). I'm specially concerned about the replayability.

This is a tough one to rate. I really wanna like it more, because it is just beautifully made, there is so much love for details and I appreciate the story of it a lot, but the overall gameplay is just not really that appealing for me.  
It's too much rolling of the same dice overall, which becomes a little too repetitive for me to enjoy it for how long the game plays. This is even more of a problem as you can not play with less characters when you have less players, so you actually have to roll for all of them and compared to similar games this also does not really let you "connect" so well to "your" character as you just play several of them.

I still think there is a lot of heart in this and whenever I have kids I guess it's great to introduce them into a light coop game with a really great story and if not it still is a keeper for me just to have as an artpiece and maybe I'll even get it out for the sake of the story.

Rinse, lather, repeat.  Without the story this is pretty repetitive.   And if you don't care about the story (which you could read without playing the game) then there isn't much here to satisfy an adult gamer.

Je m'étais procuré Mice & Mystics dans l'optique de me replonger dans l'univers d'Hero Quest qui avait bercé mon enfance. Effectivement je ne fus pas déçu :-). Même mieux finalement puisqu'il est possible de jouer seul vu qu'il n'y a pas de maitre de jeu. La partie solo est bien, cela permet d'expérimenter un chapitre avant de le faire découvrir à d'autres joueurs : ça peut être bien pour éviter de perdre du temps à se replonger systématiquement dans les règles car il y en a un sacré paquet dans ce jeu! Mice & Mystics arrive à rallier richesse et simplicité de jeu. J'ai beau enchainer les parties, aucune ne ressemble : c'est vraiment très plaisant. Avec ses 11 chapitres il y a de quoi faire avant de se jeter sur les extensions pour prolonger l'histoire. D'ailleurs un des points forts du jeu est bien son histoire : contée telle un conte de fées, l'immersion et l'aventure sont au rendez vous. A ne manquer donc sous aucun prétexte ;-)

A very different gaming experience! I really enjoy playing the mice as they travel from story to story. The game is completely scripted (as is Legends of Andor). I don't mind this type of game, but my wife really isn't a great fan of the style because it really effects replay ability. But we both agree that if you haven't played this game in say 6 months, I think you could replay all the stories again and have a good time. And if you were in a strong mood to play several of the stories back to back...I think you would be well satisfied that you got a lot of fun for your money.

The rulebook is heavy with rules...constantly going back to be sure you are following the correct way to play. It can be frustrating at how many times you will need to refer back. The information is there, concisely written and easy to understand. As you play more of the stories, you begin to get the rules down and things move along. 

A nice game for families especially. A sort of fairy tale type adventure that is very appropriate for kids. But be advised parents, you will be reading a lot of rules and guiding your kids through several stories before they might be able to continue on their own.

I applaud the attempt to provide a different theme, being more family friendly I guess. And it was fresh for a first-time play as a result. I'm just not sure I want to play a campaign of adventures where I'm being mice beating up rats and roaches before I get to go where I need to go - and doing this same thing in every single room. Otherwise it has all the same features as your typical dungeon crawl adventure game - equip your character, move and battle (or battle and move), roll dice for combat, take wounds and so on. I liked the cheese wheel - if a baddie rolls a cheese instead of sword or shield, it adds a cheese to the cheese wheel and when that is filled the game is progressed plus more baddies come out. If they roll well in battle therefore, less baddies comes out; if they roll poorly in battle, more baddies come out. Nice. The co-op decisions are who's going to battle who (which is usually pretty straight forward) and if you're going to search for more equipment (each player has a 50% chance of finding something, via a die roll, in each room) before you collectively consider the room finished and you all move simultaneously to the next room to start anew. So the emphasis is on sharing the journey, not so much the quality of the decision making. To that end, the scenarios are full of thematic fluff to read out and live. It's designed to play as a campaign with the same players - stuff you pick up in the first scenario can be used in the next. I'd happily play if others wanted because it's pleasantly easy, but I'd hope that future scenarios provide more room to room variety than the first scenario did.

This is a great game to play with the kids, and I have rated it based on that.  It is not a game I would probably play with my adult group -- the mechanics are a bit simplistic and gameplay gets repetitive pretty quickly.  But this is perfect for my nine and six-year-old -- they are begging to play it on a regular basis.

EDIT 12.20.15: Petered out after a few sessions.  Did not hold the interest of the whole brood and then the 12-year-old moved on.  Time-wise, just takes too long for the way the family's life is scheduled these days.

I like the theme and the gameplay is simple and enjoyable. I don't think the game is as memorable or satisfying as it could be though. I like that it has a narrative but think the story is a little by the numbers.

Still, if you are trying to get your kids/missus into gaming this is a friendly gateway to co-op dungeon trawling.

Also, the minis are the best I have seen. The scuplting and design is top notch, the detail is superb and the plastic is the best quality.

Overall it works fairly well and is fun to play for one game, I'll have to see if it will remain fun after several games as it appears to not have too much variety or anything original in the base game.

My children love this game.  It has a fun story, but it mainly serves to connect each scenario.  Once the scenario is underway the overall experience feels like a dungeon crawl on rails.  When we play as a family I don’t play a character and serve as the game master.  That especially helps my younger children who don’t fully grasp the game’s mechanics. All of this is perfect for younger players.  My older children now want to play Mouseguard.

Decent dungeon crawler with a good theme suitable for kids.  The game itself has a lot of rules, of which can change each chapter, so best adults are informed when playing.

The mice are diverse and I liked how one can customize their abilities and how to use them.  I loved how they incorporated story elements and the terrain.  Play seemed to go by quicker.  

Since mice rarely stay eliminated, the game is more of a race to complete rather than stay alive and complete like other dungeon games.  Thus stopping to search for the right items or side quests might get short-changed.

Played through once, for what I call our "bumbling first time learning the rules" session. It's such a great game. RPG in a box, what else could you need? You're freaking mice that are heroically fighting their way through a castle. 

Can't wait to start the campaign.

RATING: 4
A little too light for what it is. Not many interesting decisions. Don't really see any re-play value to this game due to the simplistic mechanics and lack of meatiness to the game play. There is a serious lack of luck mitigation and probability management. 

The game feels about on par with the Dungeons and Dragons co-op board games. Though slightly better due to the theme and good story interlaced through the missions. Slightly more variability and narrative in what you experience during the game. Not as mechanical and dry. 

I do wish the game had a little more depth to it. It doesn't have to be Descent, but something more than roll dice and hope you succeed would have been preferable. I believe the target audience for this game is: Dad's who want a game to play with their 6-9 year olds that isn't Candyland or Sorry. In that regard it's an excellent game.

However we will definitely play the entire campaign due to the good story attached, but then it is getting sold off. The game looks like it will take about 20hrs of game time.

Game components look great, but are of a poor manufacturing quality. Cards are getting scuffed with almost no use to them yet. Tiles are mashing at the corners and we only just started playing! 

I've been babying this thing since opening it. I can only imagine the horrors of what will happen when kids get their hands on the game. Adult supervision only.

Game feels a little expensive for what you get in the box comparatively to other similarly equipped games.

edit: Bah! Want to like this game but the game play is starting to grate. Don't have it in me to finish the campaign due to the game play  getting so dull after awhile. This is getting sold off.

A great pure co-op dungeon crawler with a cute story attached. I've so far really enjoyed going through the story chapters with my five-year-old daughter. 

I really like the innovative initiative track encounter design, it's one of the best additions to the genre I've ever seen and I'm surprised this hasn't been used before. It really shakes up the standard set rotation of turns, adds excitement to the start of every new encounter (especially since some mice get advantages depending on their position on the track). Combat is simple and fun, I like that the dice are the same for everything, and the success ratio feels pretty good for each action. Sure, there's luck (it's dice) but we really haven't felt a whole lot of bad luck whammies. And mostly, when Nez is rolling all five dice on a Battle Squeak attack, he's going to kill or seriously wound whatever is on the receiving end of his hammer. 

Okay, complaints... It can't all be good, right? Well, it mostly is. Really the only complaint I have is the price to packaging discrepancy. I'm happy with the game, I think that the contents are worth the MSRP (I was initially a little underwhelmed by the low number of miniatures for such a costly game, but the gorgeous full color rulebook and especially the 50+ page storybook make up for that). But I do feel, that if you're going to create a game with fantastic artwork on really big cardboard tiles, well, you probably don't want to let those tiles just slide around loose in the box. My copy came with one damaged tile and some others that had wear and tear on the sides right out of the box. A simple shrink wrap job would have prevented this. Live and learn, I suppose. And for the record, when I contacted Plaid Hat about sending a replacement I received a response in less than a minute. As long as the replacement arrives in a timely fashion then my only real complaint about this thing will be just a minor annoyance in the rear view mirror.

The theme is fantastic... the Gameplay sucks. The baddest Dungeon Crawler ive played yet. I think this is just for kids or a gaming group of people who normally doesnt play boardgames, but for those the rulebook is too complicated and unclear... The mechanics are poor and pretty luck driven (you have to roll ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!). My girlfriend bought the game because she loved the theme. We both are pretty frustraded by the gameplay... 

Points are just for the artwork. Think i wont play this game again...

The most rules-fiddly game Ive played so far. This REQUIRES an experienced gamer to host as the rules master and to keep things moving. EDIT: not necessarily; teach the game, then lead from the back otherwise risk losing player engagement. This is a dudes-on-map/thematic game. See slso BAHOTH or AH for similar rulesiness but this is strongly balaced and often recommended. Best with like-minded adults though perhaps.

I'm looking forward to finishing the campaign (which truthfully, my kids are loving) and trading this away.

This game relies on dice rolling way too much. It's basically all you do and you are at the mercy of these dice. And there are few ways of mitigating the luck element. Though, because of the sheer amount of dice rolled, it balances itself out. Well, usually...

Positive: very, very beautiful artwork! Also a very good tutorial video on the website of Plaid Had Games. If you lose your lifepoints, you're captured and not death. You can still re-enter the game if your companions can clear the room.

Negative: quality of the components: cards are clearly China print and get wear by just lookig at them. There are some unique mechanisms in this game (like the shuffeling of cards to determin player order of the flipping of tiles), but overall it gives me the feeling of 'been there, done that': You slaughter some minions (which is not really hard in the beginning of the game), level up if you can and crawl yourself through the dungeon/castle to reach some endpoint our fight some boss. So if you already have some co-operative games and are looking for a game that will offers you something really new, I'm afraid this game won't do it for you.

This is a hard game to rate.  The rule book is purposely lacking in the hopes that the players will use equipment with some imagination.  But mostly it just helps to confuse players as to what they can and cannot do.  And yet the game itself is unparalleled in beauty  The characters are wonderful and the theme is fantastic.  It's one of the few games that give you a sense of whimsical fantasy, allowing the adult in you to accept the rules while indulging in the your child-like nature while enjoying the theme.

A pretty neat take on the dungeon crawler style of game, as here you're all running around as mice (instead of traditional heroes). There are a lot of dungeon crawler games out there, and this one's OK. Don't think it's the best, though (Claustrophobia's better, in my opinion). But if you like the theme and want to play with kids, it's worth a shot.

No longer interested as better alternatives maybe: Siblings Trouble (more first person immersion/only 1 character each/portable) or Argonauts (learn history/better narrative), plus shorter playing time for either.

Comments so far is the constant fighting to get where you want to go, so dice fatigue and repetitiveness is a problem considering the play time is at least 90mins. This mechanism seems to interfere with the linear story telling part of the game, which because you are playing mice may cause a disconnect from an immersive experience, even more so when scenario specific number of mice means a player controls more than one mice, losing identity and emotional investment in their character.

 A well-written fantasy adventure campaign game with cute little mouse minis. The battle system is nothing unusual, but it does have a nice 'common-sense' mentality of which spaces are adjacent and it plays very simply compared to some other games in the genre.

The rulebook leaves a little to be desired in terms of clarity. It should be mentioned that no matter how many players you have, you always use four hero figures on the board, which we were not aware of in our first play. As we were playing just the first level we encountered a number of questions that weren't clear from what was written in the rulebook.

Overall, this is a fun, easy, dice-roll-y team adventure game with no overlord, which is refreshing.

Ich hasse Dungeon Crawler, weil sie mir zu träge sind und mir einfach nicht diesen Kick geben. Maus und Mystik gefällt mir hingegen ziemlich gut, weil die ganze Welt einfach so märchenhaft und kurios witzig ist. Wir haben gebrüllt vor Lachen, als wir den Knopfschild das erste Mal gezogen haben ("Mal sehen, ob der einem Kampf genauso standhält wie einem Wanst." -herrlich!). Ansonsten gibts nur ein Wort, was dieses Spiel beschreibt: hübsch. Alles ist  einfach schön gestaltet und so schön ideenreich, dass ich über meine Abneigung gegenüber Dungeon Crawlern in diesem Falle hinwegsehen kann.

Great coop game. Will Wheaton describes it as an "rpg-in-a-box" which is pretty fitting. The fighting system isn't very complicated, but it's not super easy either. The pieces and miniatures are absolutely amazing.

The one downside of the game is the lack of replayability. Once you're done with the story, there's little value in revisiting the chapters.

We're a large family and this one was popular in our household. I'd hold the rulebook and make sure everything ran smoothly, my wife had the storybook and oversaw all the chapter-specific content, while the kids would have a great time running through the halls and tunnels of the castle. The randomness of the dice rolls in combat were frustrating to me though and now I find myself enjoying the more adult dungeon crawler with no dice - Gloomhaven.

RATING: 9.5
Probably the best dungeon crawler out there. There's a lot of heart and thought put into this box. The story is phenomenal and it's one of those rare games, where the story is first class citizen - you play for the story, you anxiously await what will happen next. The story allows for a development of a connection with characters. Yes, the story is about mice, about love, courage, treachery and evil. It looks like a fairy tale, but adults should be able to appreciate the story too. It doesn't try to be pretentious or infantile like most of "generic fantasy" games do (looking at you, Descent). 

Also, it's a dungeon crawler where you cooperate, instead "evil guy vs the rest" approach. While it still has all the problems of cooperation games (alpha gamer, etc.), it's refeshing approach to feel that for once, "we're all in this together now". There are very cool and neatly tied mechanics here - initiative order, special abilities, flipping tiles to provide "3d" feeling, oh my. Do you know any other game, where you can lay down a fork, place a grape on it, and then catapult it towards your enemies, tacking the grape tile into your hand and flipping it like a coin? If it lands on a splat side, you've guessed it - it landed well :)

Miniatures are superbly done. 

I like this game very very much. I thought that the constant dice rolling will be a problem for me, but it isn't. I understand the thought behind this game - there should be luck, there should be misfortune, that's how it is and your job is to try to mitigate this as good as you can. It's not a game of "grind mobs and quickly level up, build a massive combo and then steamroll over your opponents". There is no feeling of "winning more". You're allowed to tweak your equipment a bit, but you're always in danger. It's the skill in positioning, using cheese for your abilities in the right time and exchanging equipement/cheese, that matters. 

I feel that there is enough space for meaningful decisions there and it's a challenge older players will gladly pick up (how to maximize our time, our abilities and push our luck). 

What I would prefer in future expansions, to introduce a bit more color to this. The game's palette is quite gloomy, mostly black/red/brown. It maintains a consistent theme, but I wouldn't mind to stray away from this for a while in future campaign and get some bright colours and light.

-0.5 points, because I feel it's not perfect and some more mechanics other than battle/search would be interesting. Also, while I don't mind the manual (it's actually quite well written, contrary to what you might have heard), I guess that there are many rare situations you might bump into, and the official FAQ doesn't cover them well. I believe it should be expanded.

RATING: 6.5
Great game with a lot of heart, but not complex enough for most gamers (the decisions are a bit easy). This would be a great game to play with kids, though. 


Edit: I can NEVER get this game to the table because it is too simple for most gamers, and too complex for non-gamers. I am keeping it only because I think it would be very fun to play with kids someday. A little disappointed in this game..

Components are stellar and the game has real charm. [rating based on family play]

Yes there is a lot of dice rolling here. BUT there is also a heartwarming story and a TON of discovery. Play it like an RPG, get into it. Make sure you play with the right people too. Dont bring this out to your heavy euro game night and expect to convert everyone in the room. I played this over christmas break with some family and a friend and we had a great time. This will always be a favorite of mine growing up reading Redwall and more recently enjoying the Mouse Guard and Mice Templar comics. 

Art, story telling and minis are all beautiful here.

But replay ability is not there . once its played its hard to go back especially if you're only covering the first half of a scenario. Make sure you save the game and don't replay the same parts too often.

If you allow yourself to be immersed in the theme, Mice and Mystics will hold you in a death-vice-grip and never let you go. This game basically has my credit card hostage. I am now honor-bound to purchase ALL of its future expansions. Yes ALL. So what if most of my plays are only solo? That is how good this game is. In five to seven years time I will introduce this game to my son (or daughter, too early in the pregnancy to tell) - and it will blow. his. (or her.) mind. Yeah. That's right.

This game has a lot in common with other dungeon crawler games. Essentially a race against the clock and bad guys pour out of every crevice. The search deck is filled with lots of interesting goodies and the variety in abilities each mice can learn increases the replay value quite a bit. The story is a bit sophomoric but it doesn't stop each mission from being highly entertaining. The unique setting/environments go a long way.

Almost everything functions with the roll of the dice. This is both Mice & Mystics greatest strength and weakness. A lot is gained from the simplicity, but sometimes a few bad roles will end your mission prematurely. It's rare the mice have enough time to fully explore all the options available to them.

Overall: A very impressive game built on fairly simple mechanics. Lighter than most similar games, yet provides plenty of challenge to keep things interesting. Looking forward to many more quests!

Really love the artwork and components for this game - it is very visually appealing.  Combat is simple but I think that is for the best - it keeps things moving along!  The how to play movie on Plaid Hat Games was well done and very much appreciated - it makes teaching the game basics quite easy.  There are a few things not mentioned in the video, but not many.

My only complaint?  Certain scenarios can limit the number of players.  Our group of four had a lot of fun, but chapter 2 wasn't as much fun because one person had very little to do due to story constraints. 

Still, I highly recommend this one.  Everyone in our group was impressed and asking where to get a copy for their families.

This has the potential to be a very engaging and intriguing story, dungeon crawl type game.  Thick with story and that was enjoyable.  Unfortunately, i played my first game incorrectly which made it much harder on me than it should had been which was frustrating.  Lots of small little rules that can be overlooked and I wish they had a player aid in the box. 

However, with my second play this is just a great adventure that isn't too fiddly  and just immerses you in the theme.  there is some vagueness with the rules and cards but this is the type of game that is a story and experience not a competitive game.  Frankly, it just a fun ride that so far is really close between success and defeat.  

After the third game, i find this game actually difficult to manage all the character and rules as solo game so I screw up the rules a bit but i think I would have still had success. No matter really as I think the purpose of the game is entertainment and adventure rather than deep strategic though and strict rules.

Heroquest with mice. Your mileage on this will depend a lot on how cute you find furry little rodents with swords, spells, and bows. If you enjoyed the Redwall books you'll probably love it. If the theme doesn't really grab you then the game play is not really on a par with a lot of other dungeon questing type games (and in the co-operative vein particularly the D&D Ravenloft and Ashcalon - can't remember how to spell that one). 
The mechanics are pretty straight forward and what you would expect, move, roll dice to attack, roll dice to defend, use special abilities. Monsters spawn in various places, kill them, search for stuff, reach an objective.
Its not a bad game but the theme didn't grab me (well except one quite fun moment with the mouse fork catapult - but there weren't enough of those moments).

Amazing campaign! The story really drives this game you fall in love with your little mouse friends as you crawl your way through this one. There are one or two little things the rule book could have done better but quick faq look ups got me through those points fairly painlessly and did not take away from the fun at all.

RATING: 6
The biggest gaming disappointment of 2012 for me. What promised to be a unique co-operative adventure experience (bear in mind that I don't normally enjoy co-operative games, but I had heard so many good things about this one that I decided I wanted it anyway) turns out to be, when shorn of the hype, a totally generic roll-dice-and-fight-monsters game. The much-heralded "cheese system" is nothing original, just a very basic (and randomly determined) resource system for upgrading your characters. The rulebook is another big disappointment - it is long and lavishly produced, but leaves many things ambiguous and even leaves out at least one important rule (that you can't move against the current in water).

About the only reason this game didn't go on our list of games to trade is that, while it didn't work with my gaming group, the story-based campaign is kind of nice and it might be appealing to our son (currently 2) when he is a bit older. It's OK, but aside from the story - which isn't even all that original - this game really has no reason for existing.
Having got all that off my chest, this isn't actually a bad game - and the theme is the one truly unique selling point, it's both original and quite endearing, particularly if you have a group that likes following a story over several game nights (my groups don't). But the game itself - while perfectly playable and even enjoyable - doesn't really do anything new or interesting enough to justify the game's cost or its high rating.

It is like Heroquest, Warhammer Quests, Castle Ravenloft but better. The campaign rules are designed from the get go. Each chapter advances the story and within the chapter, several of the rooms advance the story. The side quests are a nice touch and add to the immersion. A good deal of character and party customization. The initiative track alone would set this game apart as it keeps the game and encounters fresh. The miniatures, tiles and counters are gorgeous.

It´s a great adventure boardgame with an outstanding production design, a very nice artwork, and with an accomplished atmosphere. It´s a truly delight to play it! It´s considered a great (dice) game for introducing neophytes in boardgames like role-fantasy-adventure ones, but I think that maybe sometimes the game could be a little bit difficult because some rules are not clear enough, and some chapters (like Chapter 9) are very, VERY difficult to achive a victory. Also, its mechanic can be a little bit repetitive, so I recomend give some time between chapter and chapter. It´s one of the most beautiful boardgames I have in my collection, and I highly recommended it.

22-09-2014. Rated after a few plays. I think I played it about 3-4 times with friends. 

Simple cooperative dungeon crawler with great components and very nice story. I like the game, but somehow it's always a game I do not pick first. I hoped to play it with my girlfriend but so far we've preferred other games.

I was pretty disappointed - after all the hype, I was really hoping for an engrossing story-based game that my kids would enjoy, but it kind of flopped.  After I read the prologue and scenario and went through the first turn, my daughter was like "We need to get this game!" but after many more turns, my son had already left the table and my daughter said "Yeah, I guess we already have a lot better game than this."  It might partly be because I was learning the rules and had to keep checking things, but the story aspect just doesn't come through in the game play.  The game boils down to "read a paragraph about the new tile, roll a lot of dice fighting minions, repeat." You might occasionally get a new item or very rarely get a new skill, but it's also very likely that you will die ("captured") and restart without your items or cheese stockpile needed to use your skills (Maginos was our only character that never died, thanks to invisibility).  It's quite fiddly rules-wise (similar to many theme-heavy games), and could definitely benefit from some general and chapter-specific player aids.  And being a coop, it can lead to some players being led along and not investing as much in the game.  I really like the campaign idea with choices you make one chapter carrying over to the next, but it's pretty obvious what is good to have (for example, the book says "If you get Maggie, it will help you in the future."), this turns into you just repeating a chapter until you get the good stuff, rather than being a case of choosing one of 2 or more equally promising paths and the suspense of seeing how your choice will play out in future chapters.  Lastly, we never really felt invested in our characters (unlike Dungeon Run, where we start to roleplay our characters). I am interested in seeing how the chapters play out, but not so interested in having to play through them. In the end, I am very happy I had a chance to play it before buying it - I will be passing on this.

Middle of first expansion right now. Have to admit I never recommend M&M to grown gamers (too random too fiddly too repetitive etc) but still I really like this one. Playing with my 8yrs boy, we have experienced many memorable moments.My wife gladly painting minis, M&M is and will be my family's favorite for a long time for sure.

One suggestion. When playing with kids, I think you should read the Chapter you are going to play before you actually play it. Yes, that's a spoiler but game became much smoother and because you know what's is coming, you will let kids make important decisions. That makes this game more dramatic.

Looking forward to playing next Chapter. Glad to have at least 15 more Chapters ahead. And I'm pretty sure when we finish first run, my son will ask to play another campaign.

Initial rating after 2 humiliating loses in the first chapter. I enjoy this game's difficulty. The first game was kind of rough with us rule checking and what not, but the second game flowed very smoothly. I feel if taught by an experienced player (like many adventure games) would be very easy to play. 

Maybe the best part was how intuitive everything was after you got into the flow of the gameplay. Roll your sword value to attack, shield value to defend. All you basically ever do is move and search otherwise. Cheese is good sometimes and bad others. What I really liked was the initiative track! It harkens back to Final Fantasy X's turn display, which is one of the real high points of that game. I love how it's dynamic (with characters sometimes shifting positions) and very clear (every stat and word you need for the enemy is right there). This game makes fantastic use of 'not too many' minis. There are only a handful but they variety in how they appear is clever, giving them a hint of personality, maybe my biggest complaint about WHQ, an orc is just an orc.

The problems I see are that it's literally mostly just rolling dice. There's not a lot of chance for clever tactics, the level up ability seems under powered once you have the 2 or 3 useful abilities your character can use (you start with 1). The design that allows 4 characters on one space is fresh, and the disengage rules good, often you just stand still and roll dice. I get that that's the core of this genre, but I think maybe they were too ambitious to have everything rolled on the same dice, versus having different dice rolled at different times.

While the game is generally of excellent quality, a couple component complaints I have are a lack of player aids (come on, what's this?), the number of dice included (ever play heroscape with 5 dice? more would be better) and the hero minis were constantly confused. I guess that encourages painting, and the minis look fantastic, but everyone moved the wrong piece multiple times.

A very thematic game. Theme ingrained even deeper by the amazing integration of the narrative in the game. 

Mechanically, the game is Descent Light; a narrative powered dungeon crawler, without loads of complex rules and a lot of visual aides to remind yourself about your character, their skills and equipment and several other mechanics like Initiative. 

A straight A+ recommendation for those looking for a way to make their little ones enthusiastic towards board gaming, roleplaying and fantasy stories. Be sure to guide their first steps though. While 'Light', it's not easy without a supervisor. ;)

For the more experienced dungeon crawlers among us this game might be a bit too 'Light' on the rules and options, and some mechanics definitely lack structure or balance.  ;) If you're looking for a game to crunch, look elsewhere.

This is a game that allows for a very cinematic experience. Personally one of my favourite games in the genre. It delivers what it promises, and does so in the best way possible.

High rating is based on the fact that this game delivers what it promises; a quick to learn, fun to play game to use as a gateway game with your children. For the parents? It's fun to go through this experience with your kids, but I'm already looking forward to introduce them to the more difficult Andor.

The game needs player aids, rules reminders on the cards and on the boards, there should be cards for special items to outline rules so that you can avoid digging in the rule book. The game is fun and thematic but it is marred by rules ambiguity and there's something about the game that makes it difficult to remember all of the things you need to know in order to get the game running smoothly and error-free. I will have to play this game many times to iron out all of the bumps before I would try to teach it to anyone else, the rules lookups are just way too disruptive at this point.

I really enjoyed this game. My only problem with it was that on our first play through, we had to look up what seemed like a lot of FAQs and Errata online to answer questions that weren't answered in the story guide or rulebook.

Got through about half a game of this with my 7-year old daughter.  I can appreciate what it's trying to do, but I can really take it or leave it.  I'm not a big fan of games that REQUIRE you to use a certain amount of characters.  I don't like having to run multiple characters, especially playing with a young child.  I like the theme and how the dice are integrated.  It's ok, but not one of my favorites.

Co-operative dungeon crawler with an original theme and continuous story. Think about HeroQuest - the game is light, there is much battle, and luck has a significant role. However, the emphasis is more in storytelling than in leveling up. Update: I have lowered my rating because it is usually too obvious what players should do. This is a very light family game, not for gamers.

I was so excited to find a family friend RPG in a box game that I could introduce to my wife and 8 year old daughter. I thought we'd spend night after night playing with the mice and advancing through the chapters instead of watching TV. I even went so far to sell this game to the family that I painted all the miniatures which took a long time. Now they did give it an honest try, we played chapters 1 and 2 but in the end the game wasn't their style. I loved it and have been contemplating just soloing my way though the rest of the story.

The game didn't leave a strong impression on me - it's a cooperative game with a kinda sorta RPG structure (i.e. individual characters with special roles ), there are scenarios, nice visuals and stuff. As the strength of this game are visuals and accessibility it's hard to me to comment more - not being a fan of co-ops and the narrative and atmosphere aren't as strong as in for instance Arkham Horror. If you want what it offers, it's good.

We really wanted to like this game, but we felt it had way too many fiddly rules with way too much arbitrary rule ... arbitration (see, eg, the rules faq) and not enough fun to offset all the fiddliness. The long and beautiful manual somehow manages to be completely ambiguous in far too many places. There is an index at the end of the manual that is so incomplete as to be totally useless. 

I get the impression that this game was designed for kids, and we don't really know any kids.

RATING: 6
Every time I play this, it feels like I'm spending more time looking up rules than actually playing the game.
Also the game has some "gamey" rules that suck, like:
- loosing the currently equipped items when being captured, except those in the bag
- the need to roll a die to check if a mouse can leave water (yay, we lost because we all drowned!)
- the random initiative order (e.g. all enemies act before you in a boss encounter = instant death, vs. cakewalk vice versa)
- The mice "level up" and gain some (mostly useless) abilities, but they can't keep all their loot (why??)
- If mice are captured they cannot return before all enemies are defeated (seems overly punishing)

Other things that bothered us:
The number of player characters for each scenario is always given, no matter how many players there are. Having to control 2 (or even 3) characters at once distracts from the theme in this game and made us care less about the fate of the mice.

What's more, this game is a dice fest. Normally we are not bothered by prevalence of dice in a game, but here even movement is decided by dice. There are almost no meaningful decisions at all to be made.

The story aspect of this game is great but the game's mechanics, the gameplay and the rulebook are flawed.

The game is enjoyable, although I think it is best suited for kids.  It has an alright story I guess, although it is kind of silly at times.  The game can be fun to move through with friends.

The downside is the luck.  There is a LOT of dice rolling involved in this game.  So you have a lot of luck involved in this game for whether you are going to win.  One bad roll can sometimes completely knock your character out and you will be scrambling to recover.  On the other hand a good roll in that same situation and you might walk through the mission thinking it was a joke.

There was a time when I thought this was a good game. I bought it following my friend's PhD viva, he was devastated with the result (major corrections within 12 months) and I wanted to take his mind off it. 

I started playing this game with his 3 daughters (one was always only observing and rolling the dice for her dad). After getting close to the end of the campaign, I stopped enjoying the game and so did the girls. What went wrong? Well, first of all the rules are a mess and don't lend themselves to a smooth gameplay. A few corner cases in a game are fine, but once every action becomes a corner case (can you attack enemies when you're in water? can enemies attack you when you're in water? these are 2 of hundreds of questions we had no answer to during the game) it becomes very annoying. Then there are the scenarios which are very unbalanced. The first scenario is a lot harder then the next 5 scenarios. What the hell? If this game is intended for younger players, the first mission is a terrible way to introduce them to the story. 

The characters are also imbalanced and it shows. It broke my heart to see one of the girls who picked Filch as her character at the start of the campaign come to realise she won't be as much help to the team as her sister who played the prince, simply because her character was much weaker. I picked this game to have fun with my friend and his kids, not to watch their enthusiasm die in front of my eyes.

But still, we pushed on. We persevered, we conquered, we reached one of the later scenarios (9, I think). It was in that scenario that the game informed us that it lied about the number of players on box, since only 2 players could play now. What the actual fsck? Here we were, all amped up and ready to play when the reality hit us in the face: only 2 of us were here to have fun, the rest could just sit and observe. Why? What was the point? Other than a small tidbit in the story, there was no reason for that. 

This is what tipped the scale. I could see everyone being less and less interested in the game as we progressed, but this extremely annoying experience is what pushed me to pull the plug. 

I think this game should not have been released in the current state. I think someone in the playtesting department (I assume there was one) dropped the ball in a major way here. This game could have a been a hit. It had all that was needed: interesting story, nice minis (which I painted to the delight of my friend's daughters) and fantastic-looking art. However, the gameplay just doesn't match the quality of the components. The game started as a 9/10 when I got it, dropped to 8 after the first session, then reached 6 by the 2-player only chapter. Now, half a year later, I think 5 is the most is deserves. Beautiful on the outside, but really ugly under the hood.

Odalent egerekkel. Röviden ennyi a játék, ami más. A helyszínlapok egy nagy elemek, amiken különböző méretű és alakú egységek vannak. Ez grafikailag sokat dob a játékon, játszhatóság szempontjából viszont ront, mert az, hogy átlósan akkor lehet rajta lépni, ha a figuránk alja összeköt kettőt elég macerásan hangzik mindig méregetni. A harc, mind a közel, mind a távolsági egyszerű, jól kitalált. A karakterek nem sokban különböznek egymástól.
Ami tetszett, hogy a kezdeményezés random dől el. Minden résztvevő, így a szörnyek lapjait is megkeverve véletlenszerűen dől el, ki-ki után következik. Nekem ez érdekesség tette, persze kellemetlen is lehet a rossz időben jövés. A szörnyek megjelenése se túl egzakt, de ez az ára annak, hogy nem játékos kell az ellenfelek vezénylésére. Az első játékban gyorsan elbuktunk, nem tűnik könnyűnek a társas. Kisebbeknek biztosan érdekesebb és barátságosabbak a sztorik, jól kidolgozottak, de gémer fejjel nálam ez nem nagyon szempont. Számomra nem nagy ameri fanként se nem jobb, se nem rosszabb az Odalentnél, így ugyanannyi pont megy neki.

[i]Too many dice rolls bog this charming game down. Not really any decisions to make, either.[/i]

Cool setting and gorgeous artwork. Seems a bit unpolished in some areas, and there is a bit too much dice rolling I think -- yeah, it's a dungeon crawl, of course there are a lot of dice! Problem here though is that you're often rolling the exact same dice repeatedly, since the bad guy is controlled by "AI", humans roll dice for his moves as well... and the same players rolling the same dice repeatedly gets repetitive.

Wonder if it would have been better off without defense rolls, as they slow down the pace of the game. Although the liklihood of your good attack roll being blocked can prolong the tension in a combat, since combat is 90% of the game (cannot progress until killing all minions in a tile) there isn't much build up or release of said tension so it is largely lost on me.

Pros: Great atmosphere, beautiful artwork, etc.

Cons: Repetitive and some of the mechanics can feel a little frustrating at times. Moreso than its competition, this one really does mostly just come down to dice I think. Dice game fueled by a story. There just aren't many decision points that aren't extremely obvious. No matter which class you play, you're pretty much just hacking and slashing, not being clever.

May grow on me more as we play through the Chapters, maybe some really cool stuff is done later on. Or if it goes down well with the niece and nephew. I think 4 player with adults + kids will be this game's sweet spot.

[hr]Played 10+ times now, and still wish this were more tactical (I'd rate it as less tactical even than the old school dungeon crawlers that it is inspired by)

I really love the theme of this game and the strong story. However, the game is way too simple.

Very thematic, a good entry level dungeon crawl type of game but it's the story that really raises it above many other technically more challenging, similar, games and gives it a lot of appeal to more experienced gamers.
This is another solo game just for me although it can play upto 4. I have played it multi player and it felt surprisingly bland.

I absolutely love this game! We have the MP3 file with the narration and it makes the game even more immersive. When I initially got it, I was worried the theme might be geared too much toward a younger crowd, and while the story seems to be, the gameplay is very rewarding. It's not so complex that the game is difficult to learn however. Tons of fun and I can't wait to play more chapters.

As a straight-up game, I'm not sure it's entirely special or not.  It's certainly beautiful, with gorgeous miniatures and very nice graphic design and art.  But the stories DO make it special, and with it being co-operative, it makes it very fun to team up with children.  They really get into the stories and enjoy it, as do I.  Plaid Hat is known for their storylines in their games, and this is proof positive of that.  Fun game and I look forward to expansions.

Lack of player agenda. Winning or losing a scenario depends on luck at least as much as on group tactics, Limited enemy variety (and almost all of them just rush at you then dice fest until someone dies).

Outside combat (movement, loot search), failing die rolls just means wasting turns at the risk of running out of time and failing to complete the chapter in time.

Campaign mode too limited (skills maxed out after 2-3 chapters, impossibility of carrying much loot from one chapter to the next). In spite of the nominally different objectives, chapters mostly play the same way.

Redeeming qualities are production values and interesting story (esp. with children, although mine eventually got bored by chapter 5).

I really want to like this game, but it is not that easy to learn just by reading the rule and story books. I wish they had simplified this. There are just too many strange choices like dividing the cat Brodie into two separate action cards. Not intuitive at all.

Adorable little story-based dungeon game involving mice, roaches, an evil queen and a hungry cat. For most, the story element is what will totally make this game the stand out dungeon crawling game, not to mention the very cute theme. However, the limited variety of monsters and the real need for a quasi-dm (one player needs to know the scenario inside out for the special rules/events/triggers etc) means this game leans a little too much on the rpg side for me.

I owned this game for a couple of years and only played it a few times. This is because I don't find it particularly satisfying. I also feel that some of the chapters are too difficult, possibly because I never got a good enough handle on all the myriad of rules. Maybe this is a game better suited to playing with youngsters as the co-operative element is probably the best part of it.

RATING: 3
1 play, 4er

This is a pretty straightforward dungeon-crawl type of game: you set up a scenario, start in a room with monsters, fight and kill them, search for items, and make progress through the map until you fulfill the scenario objective (in our case, we needed to get through 6 double-sided map tiles). If the game timer, which advances with random events and whenever a player gets knocked out, reaches the designated end everyone loses. It's all that, with:
- some interesting mechanics for ensuring each run-through is different (encounter cards, randomly chosen, dictate different monsters in different orders)
- simple but effective monster movement rules (attack closest person, but not if they've been attacked previously this combat)
- a stupid theme I don't care about (we're mice? really?)
- a lot of dice rolling, but you're often only rolling 1 or 2 dice so it feels VERY random
- minimal character advancement: the leveling up seems overly costly (hard to tell after one play, of course)

I was very glad when, after 84 minutes, we lost and could put this thing away! I can see that this could be much more fun with a younger audience but I would MUCH rather play Descent.

Love dungeon crawlers but my wife hates complicated games... so I thought I'd give this a try. It took several chapters for me to get into this, but my wife loves it so we kept playing. It really comes alive in later chapters and is a lot of fun to play. It would be great with kids.

As a "dungeon crawlers" it really meets the demand for a "kill everything in the room before it kills you" fix. The downside is that there isn't a whole lot more tactical depth than that. Most tiles are big open rooms with little or no advantage to moving anywhere but towards your enemies. Ranged attacks hit everything in line of sight, which is usually everywhere, and the tiles are so small it seems you are never too far away from anything to be safe. But all that makes it simple and easy to learn and good for people that don't want a 40 page rule book and tacklebox full of bits. (I have Descent 2ed so I'm already fixed there!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really wanted to love this game, but it's just too random. It has a great premise, simple mechanics, engaging story, and gorgeous art, but it is a frustrating experience as a cooperative game. The reason for this is that it's too easy to be defeated by rolling too much cheese for the minions and some of the minor minions are just too hard. It's easy to get overwhelmed by too many enemies (at times we have had to use counters because we ran out of miniatures). And death is just too harsh. All of these things could probably be forgiven if it had a grittier theme, but it positively screams "kid's game" with its simple rules and storybook theme, but your kids are likely to scream after they've been bested by bad dice rolling for the fourth game in a row on the same scenario. Tremendous potential, but it just doesn't deliver.

First impressions, a bit more luck based then i would wish for. 

I love the story and the thematic aspect of the game so far. Also tougher than i imagined it would be, as i got slaughtered in first try in Chapter 1.  

Definitely need to explore it more. But the game invites me to do so.

Now played it a few more times, i feel that each time the unclear rules are impeding the enjoyment of the game. 

If only the rules were more streamlined and less open to interpretation.

Rating based only on playing the first adventure.  The theme is very strong and the rules are fairly easy to understand without sacrificing too much game play.  I like how the game has a built in timer system that forces you to weigh the benefits of further exploration versus the time used up in such exploration.  The combat system is interesting enough without being overwhelming and affords a decent set of options that elevate it above mindless repeated attacking.  I also like the surge mechanism as an added pressure to eliminate enemies quickly instead of playing combat very safe thus lengthening the time the game takes to play.  So in summary a good game that has an interesting story and doesn't overstay its welcome.

I think Mice and Mystics story narrative is very well done. I am only on chapter 3 so I can't comment on replayability until I have done all of the chapters. I like the initiative track and although it's combat system is not very deep I do like it better than the D&D games. I like to position my mice and I like being able to roll some dice for defense (vs being at the mercy of a d20).

I would like greater variety in bad guys.

I like the leveling up options here as well.

Looking forward to seeing what the next chapters hold. 

Update: During our 5th play both kids wanted to stop before finishing. My 11 year old son grew tired of the over all length of the game and the amount of down time between turns. He also wasn't enamored with his choices/results during his turn (a lot of his Filch attacks were blocked). My 5 year old daughter is still willing to play but it ran too long for her as well.

I know I could just play part of a chapter, but that feels unsatisfying and we don't have table space to keep the game up for an extended time.

My son actually said he would rather play Candy Land. Candy Land is probably his least favorite game too. He just wanted the game to end quickly.

I really enjoy playing games solo, but oddly enough I don't feel like giving this a go on my own. Not when I have Thunderbolt Apache Leader and Lord of the Rings:LCG.

We'll see what happens the next time we play (without my son).

We tried it a few more times and the kids reached the conclusion (well my daughter at least) that she didn't want to play the game anymore...she just wanted to hear how the story turns out.  So, I read the chapters to her and put the game up for trade.

I love this. The one thing Im missing is more carryover from chapters to chapters. I would love to keep building my character better, get even better items, but you have to start almost fresh every time. It would maybe be hard to balance a story game like that, I dont know. I would recommend painting the miniatures, really helped my group with immersion. I loved the painting job aswell, my first attempt at it :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lovely components. The miniatures look fantastic, and will be good for a new painter or a veteran. Tiles are thick, art is great.
The overall mechanics work well; exploring and moving around the castle is smooth, and the 'flip' mechanic allowing you to travel through the floor and ceiling is very clever and thematic. Combat is basic, but there are some interesting abilities and treasures. The cheese mechanic is a decent way to drive special powers.

Lots of complaints and nit-picks: There are only two female characters, and they are completely irrelevant to the plot. Lots of confusing spots in the scenarios; often we've had no idea how we are supposed to play situations. Most scenarios are 4 player, but one is only 2 1/2 and one is 3 1/2 (1/2 meaning "a player that doesn't work well or really participate"). Needs scenario reference cards for all the special rules in each room. Several party items have plenty of room for summaries of the item, but just don't bother. 1 more die would make die sharing a lot smoother. Low key advancement does mean you can drop characters in and out, but it also means there's not much feeling of progress. You can't keep enough items to make some abilities useful.

I don't feel any attachment or investment in the characters; they are clearly someone else's characters in someone else's story.

Overall, this seems like a game that's less than the sum of its parts. It's fun, but it's missing something - possibly a lot of somethings. I doubt we'll be going back to it after completing the campaign.

Love the theme. Light cooperative dungeon crawler.

Update: moved to 7.5 from 8.5 because the rules can just be a bear. The tactical decisions are usually fairly straightforward... I'm referring to rules like "How do I move to another board?" and "Wait, we FLIP this? How? Why?"

The decisions I had to think about weren't usually strategic as much as wrangling with game rules. Alas.

Beautiful artwork and creative story telling are a big plus.  The gameplay is interesting as well.  There are some misses as well in terms of lack of more monsters/components and rules/scenario issues which keep me from giving it a 9.

Awesome adventure quest game with a cute little mice adventuring party. Game seems well balanced with most chapters being fairly easy to get past whilst at the same time leaving you always feeling pressured and in trouble. I also like the story, which I will admit might be a bit too "cutesy" for some people but for me I felt it worked exactly the way they wanted it. Not too much I don't like about this game, maybe they could have added a better option to play the game if you aren't working through the story line (which is great anyway!).

Hmm...bit undecided on this one. The gameplay is ok, but very basic. It's designed for family, younger kids etc. The problem is the scenarios go on for way to long. We are only on the early chapters, but we found even they can take hours to finish. 

The issue is the gameplay doesn't have the depth needed to support these lengthy play times. It becomes very repetitive and we found ourselves just wanting it to end at times.

Thematically, M&M is one the best games out there, but the lack of gameplay depth combined with the long playtime is what really brings the game down. 

I think this is a one and done. I really couldn't see myself wanting to play this through a 2nd time. I am actually surprised it's rated as highly as it is. It seems many people are so blinded by the great story and theme that they can't see the woods through the trees. 

It's a shame...it really is, I want to like this more. At the moment I rate it a 6, but I can easily see this dropping further with more plays.

Very gentle and decision-free. And oddly, the first scenario, designed to introduce you to the game, has you looking up movement in water, picking up items that, rather than explain what they do, refer you to the rulebook... This doesn't seem very polished.

It is very pretty and I'd probably play it again, perhaps even a few more times, but there's really not a lot here in the way of decisions/tactics/depth/replayability...

Tentative rating after a single play of the first chapter.

Update: Rating stands after replaying chapter 1, and playing through chapter 2.  There are just some clarity issues with the rules. I'm enjoying the game quite a bit.  It feels like a Euro version of an RPG-like board game, in direct contrast with a game like...Shadows of Brimstone, which is at the other end of the spectrum.

A fun, light dungeon crawler with a novel setting, a fun story, a beautiful aesthetic, and plenty of great in-game thematic touches.  It seems like it would be a fantastic game for kids, though the rules are more complicated than something like HeroQuest (I need to reference the rulebook much more often than I'd like).

But I do think the game system relies too much on dice: combat, movement, searching for items, gaining "currency" (cheese), the game clock, getting out of water before washing away... EVERYTHING is based on die rolls.  One session could turn out to be quite easy and another time it could be a frustrating and futile endeavour, even if you made all the exact same choices each time.  Player agency takes a back seat while luck drives the bus, and sometimes that leads to a bumpy ride.

Loving it!  As a lifelong Redwall fan this is right up my alley.  My wife and I are playing through the campaign right now and having a blast.  The biggest problem I can see at the moment is that it really almost demands to be played with a consistent group of people and that doesn't mesh with my gaming habits these days.  I'd feel weird just dropping in with some random players and just saying, "Hey, let's play Chapter 7, how bout it?"  
All in all, though, very glad to have this and just one through the campaign and I'll feel like I got my money's worth.  This is a very joyous game -- I play it and I feel twenty years younger.

I have to give this a 9... no 10 for the scattered rules.  The characters are fantastic, the minis are really nice (plastic though, not resin), and the story is actually more involved than you might think at first, and honestly, should be considered by Pixar.  My suggestion, as well, is for one person to become very familiar with the rules before getting the family in on the fun.  Also, if you have someone who can really read stories (enthusiasm, voices), then this game will truly shine.

I have been running/playing games for about 40 years and the latest crop of rules are either great, or quite a mess.  This one isn't quite the latter but the rules are dense, the booklet is a page flipper, and there are a number of conditions and modifiers you should at least have an idea where to find in the book so as not to slow the game down.

With that accomplished, and the game on the table (expect a couple of nights JUST for the first chapter, especially if you have younger children), Mice and Mystics should become a favorite, and will tell a story that will leave an impression.

[thing=124708][/thing] is a light game of mice heroism, exploring tunnels, sewers, dining rooms, kitchens and such places. A mice life isn't a safe one, because there are evil rats, big spiders, roaches - some of them greedy! - and terrible centipedes. But the kingdom must be rescued from the hands of the dark sorceress Vanestra, that put the King under her spell, and now the King lies in his bed, an inch from death. His loyal servants were arrested and, in jail, the wizard Maginos used a powerful conjuration to turn everyone in the cell into little mice, in order to escape. But, now they cannot turn back into human form! So, in their new mice might (cuteness?), they will try to do what everything that needs to be done to right the wrongs.

The theme in [thing=124708][/thing] is paramount to its enjoyment. It is a fairy tale, so expect fairy tale things - talking animals, weird magic, heroism even when facing overwhelmingly odds. There are long passages that are nothing more than flavor text, but, sure they are tasty ones.

The rules, inspite of the thematic pressure, are solid: more on the light side, but with enough depth to be interesting to gamers, young or not.

The replayability, normally an issue in most games with scenarios to be played, isn't in its higher form in here, but there is enough for a good lot of plays, because: you have more mice than you can use in a given mission; there is more special abilities that you can get; the Search uncover a plethora of items and events (you will probably won't see all of them even if you play the whole campaign); the enemies appear in a tile semi-randomly: it depends on the point of the Chapter that the story is; and, of course, because of the dice rolls - in a Chapter, one usually punny Rat can become a Rodent Demigod, resisting to everything and capturing everyone, for example.

The components are top notch and the art is climatic, really well done in every way. Our plays took us anywhere between 60 to 150 minutes.

[thing=124708][/thing] provides a good level of cooperation between players, because many of the skills of the mice work only if they are together (like Tilda's Mace) or work in the others (like many of the special skills from the Leader deck).

All in all, [thing=124708][/thing] provides a great experience and I'm sure will play the whole campaign, and the sooner, the better!

What I have learned by this game?!
First play, than paint the minis xD

Like others said here: I really want to like the game (even more I already painted all the minis) but it will not happen...
I will sell it with painted minis...

Too many dice rolling (and I love dice rolling, no doubt) but not really anything else except the story.
And dice rolling is frustrating, if the dice are rolled for the enemies, there is a 50% or 66% chance for a bad result, hit, defend or cheese on wheel... and that means more enemies and even more enemy dice roll...

Not my usual sort of game, but with kids it's fantastic. 

So a new favorite family fun game with wonderful thematic latching. A much improved co-op notion than Pandemic for this sort of table, as it's about an RPG-like creativity working together to get silly things done racing a ticking clock. Much less constraining than other co-ops. For example, the group gets to share it's stuff while taking on the roaches, spiders, cats, and environmental puzzles, unlike co-ops that make even sharing something a tempo laden puzzle to negotiate.

Lots of laughter, tension, and no bossiness.

This is a lot of fun to play and the component quality is great, although the casting of the miniatures is nowhere as good as the company's that do this exclusively.  I also had just as much fun delving into my first attempt at painting miniatures! Pics of which are posted in my gallery.

Excellent gateway adventure RPG with enough fluff and flair to entertain a more seasoned gamer.  The game components are of the highest quality.  The storyline writing is horrid, which somewhat mars the experience.  If a seasoned storyteller is in your group I suggest giving them the text in advance so they can alter the telling for quality.

The game is fun with the right crowd...my seven year old daughter likes it perhaps more than I do. Better after an initial play to work out the kinks. Also...be sure to use the suggested number of players. Too few leads to excess surges on the cheese wheel. Most of the characters are quite fun to play, although my favorite are Filch and Collin.

RATING: 7.5
Mice and Mystics is essentially a very cute and atmospheric co-op rpg and quite innovative in how key items can be used to overcome obstacles and generally make life easier. The initiative track and fighting system reminded me a bit of old school japanese RPGs and work very well. The artwork and miniatures are really well done - too bad the cards and player sheets are of such low quality. No need to own, but would certainly like to play again.

light-medium "crawl" with heavy theme!!!
the story is awesome and the side objectives on every mission keeps the game in tense.
i like it very much(the explore mechanic that flips tiles is very interesting!)
the rules are not so many and very clear BUT the choices are many and the tactics you are going to follow are very important.it has a big part of luck with the dice but not to concluse the game entirely.
much more "on" the theme than descent.

After several plays, the game is somehow disappointing. It misses the audience, i.e. kids: is too hard to beat, the missions are too long, the combat system is unsatisfying. The narrative? Great. Miniatures? Excellent. Everything else is not adjusted to presumed players (too long for kids, too basic and mechanicaly boring for adults). Wish the storyline and production values were complimented with combat system from Super Fantasy!

RATING: 9
Man, I know it's a big luckfest, but it hits a very nice spot for me. It's easier to sell my wife on than Descent, it's not so simple that it loses the feel of a dungeon crawl but it's easy enough to not scare people away too badly. I really like the theme. It's a gorgeous game. It'd be nice if it were built to scale a little better, but most of my plays are going to be with two, anyway, so it's not that big of a deal for me.

RATING: 8
A rewarding Ameritrash co-op. This one must be a love child. Beautiful and thematic art, nice miniatures that couldn't resist to paint and good quality components (minus the cards which require sleeving, the typical fail of PHG -products) and engraved symbol dice. Yummy story connecting the scenarios and seems to work for quite a large age scale, some character development through skills and items (we want more!) and possibility to play a campaign. Co-op works well with two and four players while the three player game involves one player more (four mice divided between players). For anyone seeking to save the kingdom, free the righteous king from wicked enchantment and ready to go fearless against centipede, rats, doomsday machine and whatnot. Works as a family game for us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's gorgeous, and the background fairy tale plot is wonderful. But the game is very shallow and repetitive, the game consists of little else but "enter a room - attack - defend - attack - defend -... - enter the next room". And the rulebook is probably the worst I have ever seen, it is terribly structured and makes the game seem way more complicated and unclear than it actually is.

Painting the minis is well worth it. Sometimes, the game plays like a movie. Collin had an epic move once, being catapulted onto the kitchen counter, then using backslash to take care of some beasties, then doing some more amazing moves immediately after. We still are talking about it, months later. Nez's catchphrase is, "This hammer is heavy, guys!" whenever he rolls a 1 for movement. So much fun.

This is my absolute favorite boardgame currently. I love the Mouseguard/Redwall theme, and the engaging story element of the game. 

It is a dungeoncrawler with heart, and with characters that I really grew to care about as the story progressed.

This is also a great family game, and a good "gateway" game for children or reluctant spouses/significant others in my experience.

I have a soft spot as well for cooperative games, and this one definitely fits the bill, with all players taking on the role of the heroes. Unlike many games of this type, there is no player controlling the monsters, which adds an extra element of cooperation amongst all players. 

I can't reccommend this game any more highly, and I am looking forward to the upcoming (2) expansions!

It's... urf. The theme and the game itself captured my kids' imagination and it created a lot of fun memories for them. They loved making little personalized envelopes to deck out the game with extra materials.

But it just doesn't work. It's just too easy to fail a mission with so many failure states and so much that it demands of you. (The timed cheese wheel is an especially bad culprit.) Failing means redoing the mission. So as the parent, do I just let us fail? Keep my thumb on the scale to try and mitigate it? The game itself lets down the story and theme, and it's such a crying shame.

Have not played yet, but love the concept.  I've heard good things!

The miniatures, which I'm in the process of painting, are great!  A couple came with minor flaws (knicks in the plastic), but they're otherwise nice.  Have finished painting the roaches, centipede, and spider so far.  Rats are next. 

My first mini painting project - chosen to start before Descent since they seemed a little easier.

This is a well made game, and if you want a game with a deep story (maybe because you are playing with children), then I would recommend it.

My low rating is because it is not a game that I enjoy playing.  It focuses far too much on story, and not enough on interesting game play.  There is a little bit of luck mitigation (some bad die rolls provide cheese -- basically mana -- when they fail), but not nearly enough.  Roll well, and winning will be easy.  Roll poorly, and even the intro scenario will kill you.

Great theme and is fun if you like dice fests.  The leveling is cool and the character interaction is great.

For me there were too many rules and special conditions.  It's a little too much dice rolling when playing solo since every creature has to roll to even move (there can be a lot of creatures on the board).

Overall great theme/story and production/components.  The large amount of rules and having to always reference the instructions turned me off.

PLAYING WITH KIDS RATING:  [bgcolor=#99FFFF][s][color=#99FFFF]-[/color][/s][b]7[/b][s][color=#99FFFF]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor]

A kid-friendly dungeon crawler.  Game play is basic kill & level up which gets a bit repetitive after a few chapters, but the kids enjoy the story (reminiscent of the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_Guard]Mouse Guard[/url] books) and focus more on building up their mouse character rather than advancing the group's aim.  The game and the campaign require a fair bit of overhead to go along with an unexpectedly steep learning curve for a game advertised as ages 7 and up.  Sure a seven year old can participate, but a bigger kid or an adult needs to do the heavy lifting of knowing the rules (at least initially) and keeping the game machine running.  The rulebook covers all the bases, but it could have been laid out better and/or had a better index.  Co-op's and dungeon crawlers are not among my favorites and this game further entrenches that sentiment.  A fun way to spend some time with the kids, but after the halfway mark of the campaign my eldest (10) has lost some enthusiasm.  My youngest (7) still very much enjoys the game.  Will likely take an extended break after the campaign before we start on the already acquired expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The components of this game are fantastic. Amazing miniatures, art, and storytelling. The idea of the base box being all you need for future expansions is compelling.

Unfortunately this game for our group sits right between "board games" and "table top RPGs"... to the point where we usually just end up picking another board game or playing an RPG.

I really like this game and its theme! Im almost done painting all the miniatures that came in the base set. Love the theme and the minis, but the gameplay depth to time to setup ratio really isnt there for me. Would love to play this game more, but I tend to never want to play solo because it feels like so much work to set up. Always willing to play with a group though!

What a great game. I love the components and the flair. And when I was unboxing it something strange happened: My wife wanted to play it instantly. Usually she does not like to learn new games but with M&M it is different. Now we played the first chapter and enjoyed it very much. The rules could be clearer or easier to find sometimes, but all in all a great game that will entertain us for years. I finally painted my minis and am now looking for the Downwood tales. I just wish all the components (or the base game + expansions) would fit into a single box.

Well, the production quality is nice, but I'm not a big fan of thematic games. This one has a lot of rules and the rulebook leaves a lot open for interpretation. You WILL need to use an FAQ in order to play this game. Furthermore, it leaves you with few strategic decisions to make and everything is largely luck dependent. The story and of course the extremely high quality of the components are the selling points of this game, but in my opinion it lacks quality in the gameplay department.

The mice warriors are in a dice rolling, storytelling, dungeon crawl RPG through canned adventures against time.  Level up. Protect your cheese! Lots of little detail rules and special setup for all the tiles. I've got my Pathfinder and d20 3.5 to handle the RPG duties.

Story heavy games aren't my thing and the rulebook is one of the worst in any game I've ever played. Our first episode lasted almost four hours due to bad rulebook as we had to stop so many times to check stuff and on the 2nd play we found several rules that we got wrong the first time. After using Google for some rules we found out that we really weren't alone with this problem.

Rating might go even lower, however my gf seems to be loving this game even and I'm 100% sure we will finish it eventually. Also slightly disappointed at the lack of different enemies in the game and the minimalistic player leveling up.

Gloomhaven will totally destroy this game for me.

Pretty awful mechanics and no strategy amounts to constant dice rolls. Set up...roll to move...roll to attack...roll to defend...

Quality components and a cute can't make up for the somewhat obtuse rules and terribly un-fun gameplay. I can't understand why this isn't rated lower

Wife's 3rd favorite game. Can't wait to play this with my kids! A great story based cooperative game that has real peril and real cuteness... and the characters grow over the game, not just in might but in courage and character development.

Game time may run long, but that is a price to pay for such a family friendly fun game.

I am obviously enamored with this game- it is like adorable Dungeons and Dragons with mice instead of humanoids and a storybook instead of a Dungeon Master. But don't let the cuteness fool you, we quickly found out that this game can be brutally difficult.

RATING: 7
A game that missed by a seven years because my kids are now too old to appreciate it.  Rating is for families with fantasy-loving children and adults that are barely in touch with reality. Like me.

Mice and Mystics could teach a lesson to the Descent family, since tying random monster spawns to the story progression is a smart innovation - though it can lead to high-speed losing if too many cheese symbols appear.

The initiative track hijinks (e.g., the Rat's special ability) is another example of a clever twist on standard dungeon crawlers.

Would play again, this time with D-Con.

Mechanically this is a fairly straightforward dungeon-crawler, but what makes this game really shine is the way the story and theme is integrated into everything you do.    There's tons of variety as you go from chapter to chapter, and the whole thing is beautifully presented.   Fantastic artwork, great-looking minis, and nice, high-quality materials (cards and boards).

Excellent customer service too!  Lily was missing an arm in my copy so I emailed PHG, got a response within 20 minutes, and had a replacement in hand a couple days later.

Mixed feeling about this one. It's way more difficult then you would expect and you need quite a bit of luck with the dice rolls. Gameplay should have been worked out a little bit better and the rulebook isn't as clear as it could be.

I can see this being a hit with adventure-loving kids. Unfortunately, lots of rules questions slowed down our first play. More effort could have gone into clarifying the rules on the cards, to reduce rulebook lookups. There's enough confusion over symbols and wording on cards to spoil the flow of the game until you learn how everything works. Just a bit more tightening up here would greatly improved the experience. As a light dungeon-crawler it works well, with some tactical decisions and a nice story to explore. Great if you regularly game with 6-10 year olds.

This is a unique offering in the dungeon crawl class.  Highest appeal is for kids, but would also appeal greatly to those adults turned off by the normal "hack-n'-slash" theme of dungeon crawls.  The game is thematically much more rich than others of its ilk.  The story-line parts add a really nice element, especially for kids, but adults should not find them too "cheesy."  I found play very smooth and the rules straightforward, if you do not try to over-interpret them but instead just focus on what they allow.  My only qualm is that it gets kind of samey after a while, but really this is a problem with all dungeon crawl types.  The advantage with this game is that they can release new story books with no or minimal components and make reasonably priced expansions, vs. the mega-costly-stuffed boxes you get from something like FFG's Descent.

Great, light coop.  With the fairly quick chapters, it makes it easy to have a short gaming session that sets up quickly.

Decisions are fairly simple, but I like that sometimes after playing a long, complex game (ie Arkham Horror).

Good story and components. But it's not interesting enough to play more than 2-3 scenarios. After that the game just repeats itself. What would save this? An legacy variant where you only can level between scenarios.

RATING: 5
'Mice and Mystics' is a cute, charismatic game with a very evocative narrative and graphic design. This really is a game I would like to play with kids who could get really get into the theme of rodent warriors fighting against an army of vermin. 

For me personally, though, I think the gameplay is too shallow and repetitive. You do the same thing over and over again: move, fight, roll dice. Rinse and repeat. And the game may have an amazing story, if the gameplay isn't there to back it up, I'm simply not interested. The dice rolling is really lucky. For about 2/3 of the game I wasn't able to hit ANYTHING with Maginos (the mage mouse), only to wipe out THREE(!) rats toward the end of the game in one blow. Moments like that are great, but they can be few and far between. 

So ultimately, I would recommend this as a kid's dungeoncrawl adventure story before bedtime, but one more advanced, serious gamers can easily steer away from.

A huge investment on my part - this game seems really good however it will fall flat on its face if you don't play it with people who like adventures games (or games like Descent). Not a plug and play type of game. You do not have to play through the campaign however it is recommended you do so, therefore you should have a solid group to play this game. In any case, the cheese mechanic is interesting and game is pretty fast paced. Good game with a great crowd.

I simply do not understand the ratings for this game unless you are solely playing it with your pre-teen daughter who likes the cute theme.  If you completely ignore the theme, this is simply a very boring dungeon crawl without almost any decisions beyond move and attack.  Yeah, there is a bit of a story, but so many other games do it better.  I can't see any reason why adults would want to play this amongst themselves.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I have pretty mixed feelings about this game and my rating adequately reflects this.

This game can definitely drag for a player that isn't so lucky at rolling dice.  Not only did I experience this personally, but so did others in my group.  Since much of the combat, movement, defense and searches rely solely on successful dice rolls, it becomes immediately apparent why luck is critical to enjoy this game.  To be quite honest, I was quite frustrated losing my first two games only because of poor dice rolls, and NOT a result of bad strategy or any lack of understanding of the game rules.  In my opinion, this is a MAJOR flaw that this game embodies.

There are times when characters in the game definitely feel some downtime and there are no fulfilling actions available for that character other than to search.  Unfortunately, even this is limited as a character can only search a tile once successfully.  Also, the initiative track prevents players from strategizing effectively to determine the best turn order for the group.  
 
The components in this game are excellent!  I give Plaid Hat Games two thumbs up on the production value.  My only gripe of any of the components are the terribly organized and incomplete rule and scenario books.

Where this game fully shines is in the extremely creative narratives that carry the players through a series of quests, so to speak!  I found this aspect quite unique in that I actually feel as if I am reading a story of these mice and their adventures.  As one can note by the ratings found here on BGG for this game, it has become many people's favorite game in such a short amount of time; thus, ending up in a geek's top 10 list.

It is definitely not one of my favorite games, but I am happy to have it in my collection.  It will not see the table as much as others due to its luck dependence and fiddly rules, but it could be a great gateway game to introduce others to the hobby, especially younger players.

-Final Thoughts-
It is extremely apparent that the majority of high ratings are those who play this game with a much younger player (son, daughter, nephew, niece...).  Otherwise, this game seems to be relatively mediocre in a roll-move-roll-battle... rinse and repeat fashion.  It is obvious that the designer of this game was not consistent with his choice of game audience as M&M feels all over the place, which leads to an unstructured and minimally fulfilling experience for the adult gamer.

Visually M&M is stunning. It was the major point why I bought this game. Mice & board just screams quality. It would have been nice to have more minions, but hey, the campaing works well with what you've got. Rules are simple and intuitive, but not so that it would be boring to play.

This is the Hero Quest of it's age. And that is a compliment.

Strong narrative and quick playing. Only drawback is that The incentives for drawing a strategy card each turn are too great. This means scoring the highest level of victory is too easy. I would suggest limiting the draw of strategy cards to every other turn or prohibiting them after the automatic German victory turn (turn 8?) has passed. 

Having too easy victory conditions usuall kills solo games for me but I still think this game has such a strong narrative I keep wanting to play. 

One thing to note is that this game is less like D-day Omaha beach and more like Ghost Stories in game play. The movement and combat are very simplified and not like a traditional hex and counter wargame at all. 

The character event cards and tactical cards (if they are used) do offer a good amount of replayability which is why it's a shame the scoring mechanism discourages the use of tactical cards.

First couple of plays didn't impressed me all that much.

The idea is ingenious, and the game has a pretty strong narrative. But the tactical challenge is only medium.

It is a pretty fun game, with all the problems happening everywhere, and you running like crazy trying to stick your fingers on every crack of the dam. 

But it didn´t excited me as well as Where There is Discord, another solitaire design by the same author.

It's hard to explain. It's fun, but not really that much of a tactical challenge. It seems to me that too much emphasis was made around the story being told and not so much on the ingenuity of the mechanics.

The character events are really interesting and add a lot to the story, but I got the feeling they were poorly implemented, for it's really hard to remember the details of trigger conditions and effects of all the events that start to accumulate.

Being myself a lover of solitaire games with a good narrative and nice components, I'll keep this game for a while and try it some more, but with so many games and so little time, Codeword Cromwell might get traded in the future.

EDIT after a few plays: significantly easier to win if you choose only British Strategy cards. Seems broken. Will randomize German and British cards next time.

EDIT 2: adding paste-ups to character cards is definitely a must. Last time I ended up ignoring good character events for it was impossible to remember their triggers and conditions by the end of the game. I don't understand why the cards don't have texts. They're huge.

I really looked forward to this game, I was expecting a real "Eagle has landed " adventure.

But not very far into my first game I found myself rather bored with it.  Dripping in theme, but the actual play, the decisions I was called upon to make, were not very interesting.  There is a sense of being included in on an extended inside joke, but the joke isn't THAT funny, I want to do something, not just admire the clever story.

I'd write a review, but only after playing several more times, and I'm not sure it's going to hit the table enough to ever get reviewed.

Good solo game. Fantastic art and components and there´s arguably no wargame so full of theme. It´s an alternate history where the Germans successfully invaded England. Leni Riefenstahl made a movie "The longest night" about this. The nearly hundred page story book is full of stuff like this. 
Still, I´d love to see more information on the cards...or at least any information apart from a picture of a character.
In addition, it suffers from the problem every solo game does: You´re clearly playing against a system here. Pretty much the States of Siege system of Victory Point games. In addition, some cards simply feel unfair, especially at the end.

Another great game, creating a fascinating narrative each game. Essentially, this is a 'tower defence' game, which sees you trying to protect the central church, using a variety of locals including villagers, local characters and Home Guard units, while German troops are arriving onto the map from a number of directions. The map is huge, and the counters are huge. If anything the map is just a bit too big, and will stop me playing more often than I would like. The rulebook is not great, and there is a lot of cross-referencing of rulebook, reference sheet and Intelligence Briefing booklet while playing, which all takes a lot of time. Play is very procedural with a large number of steps to go through each turn. Despite all this, it is still a game that is well worth playing.

Great game. I like it more than Where there is discord. The game is quite easy to win, but I don't consider this a problem since this is a game that you play for the atmosphere.
Only reason for not giving it a 10 are the strategy cards. The incentive to draw German cards is too low. I take German and British cards on alternating turns until turn 13 or when the invasion track reaches 8. Then I choose based on the invasion track and possible tactical events I would like to activate. I personally find the game fun and challenging this way. The chaplin mechanic doesn't play a role in my games. Chaplin can be easily unmasked early on by moving as many characters as possible (7 with bank manager) to the police station and rolling again using Finley (both dice) and Reverend (1 die). I usually unmask chaplin by turn 5.

RATING: 6.5
Tough to grade this one.  Played twice.  Positives are amazing components, clear rules, unique mechanisms (character events) and fun characters/weapons.  However, I figured out immediately that the main key is keeping the invasion marker as low as possible so I drew the British card every turn instead of the German card to minimize the reinforcements.  I did not need any help from the tactical events.  Both games only went to 7 on the invasion track and the Germans never really had a chance.  Disappointing that wasn't fleshed out during playtest.  Game is too easy and that doesn't work for me.  I finally finished the last 5 turns of your 2nd game so I could pack it up.  Not the best sign.  If I play again I'll need to house rule something (saw some ideas).

RATING: 8
An enjoyable narrative romp through a 'Dad's Army'/'Went the Day Well' mash up. At it's heart is a castle defence mechanism which delivers some reasonable tactical decisions, better than in your typical 'States of Siege' game, but get ready to roll well - or perhaps more importantly roll badly for the Wehrmacht.

The main event however is the immersion the game creates in the story it's telling - there are enough narrative variables to keep the game different on repeated plays.

Component quality is good but there are a few functional flies in the ointment and perhaps one design glitch. The functional issue for me is the constant need to keep looking trigger events and effects up in the briefing book for character cards that are activated but not deployed. Given that the cards are a good size there was scope to put more of that detail onto the cards to save the look up.

The possible (played the game 4 times now and still think it's an issue) design glitch involves the Strategy Card - Tactic card trade off decision. It looks to me that the 'correct', in terms of maxing your chances to win as the British, move is to always take the British Strategy event and forgo the Tactics Card in order to slow the advance on the Invasion track - it gives more points and more importantly it delays the entry of German regiments.

If the latter turns out to be the case then it fairly easy to house-rule away - randomly select a German/British Strategy card should work fine.

Fun game though.

Just finished my first game of Codeword Cromwell: The German Invasion of England, 8 June 1940, the British won a tactical victory with me scoring 168 merit points for a good performance. 

An excellent game, I can see the game play out in many possible paths and endings, although I don't see how this game could be used as a filter of officer candidates, there is certainly a moderate element of luck which sort of negates an objective selection process. As a solitaire game, it excels at giving the player lots of options and various ways to approach the situation and lots of ways to fail. I can see using this as a tool to psych out poor candidates that has no leadership & tactical fitness though. 

But I wouldn't say a high score means that much. For example, you get a pretty bonus if you can reveal & capture the spy in the village, to do so you need to encounter certain tactical events that are randomize in your pile of cards and then you need to get lucky with revealing the unit in a space that has lots of other units to have a chance to kill him/her or capture him/her. All fairly random really. 

To actually get these cards you need to forego receiving British strategic advantage (you don't get tactical event cards if you received British strategic cards in any given turn.) If you did that you would very likely end up allowing the grand strategic situation get horrible (towards a general British surrender), not to mention the Germans actually getting even more tactical reinforcements in the play area. You may get lucky with your strategic die rolls of course... but you've to be pretty lucky. As an officer, I can't imagine giving up the strategic situation for a battle victory. 

Having said that, I really enjoyed the GAME, it was very challenging to ensure efficient use of your resources and its very tense to see where the Germans appear and during battle die rolls. There is a ton of narrative and through the paragraph booklet you get a lot of flavor text that really immerses you into the story and all the characters involved. The characters all have backstories and names, like Ambush this really gets you hooked. Absolutely brilliant.

Needless to say its a beautiful game and the rules are easy to understand. The only gripe I would have with the components is a missing Turn Sequence reference card, instead which you have to refer to a certain page in the manual. It could have been printed on the back of the manual like many other rulebooks. No biggie. Also I found it weird that some very important rules are in the end of the paragraph events (briefing) booklet. I hadn't realized that each character in the game has a "special" power that you need to keep track of till turn 2. Not a big problem and I found that I internalized all the character's abilities soon enough. (It was nice because their abilities and name and the counter art really adds personality to all the characters). This may be difficult for some and a quick reference card with all the character abilities would've been nice. 

The entries in the briefings booklet are brilliant and a lot of fun to read. Lots of plausible hypothetical situations that adds so much theme to the game. 

Loved it. I plan to play again, this time using more of the tactical cards to see how it all pans out that way. In my game I was able to prevent the Panzers from entering the game which I assume helped me win. (Although, it meant that I also didn't get reinforcements either, I suspect the tactical cards really balances out the deteriorating strategic situation, the few tactical cards I did draw were all pretty powerful and useful.)

To be honest....I was a bit underwhelmed by this one. $100+ for a big box, a big mounted map(that easily could have been printed on paper), a couple of sheets of really big counters, some fairly flimsy cards, dice, and an unnecessarily silly rules book written as if it were an intelligence briefing. I really wanted to like this game but wasn't exactly bowled over by it. Considering I can purchase any Conflict of Heroes game for half the price and have better components, this was not money well spent IMO.

I am not solo player per se. 

This is by no means bad game. However my query is that it is only game but I don't see much historical insight in it. Bunch of drunk pub guys armed with bottles taking down fallschirmjagers is little bit too much for me. 

Also same elements of game are not very balanced. It seems always beneficial to take British strategic event, because it is too risky to try British tactical event as probability of not getting anything helpful is big and you will also make more likely bigger German invasion. 


I do prefer games with more history and for example Where there is Discord gives much better feel. 

But I must point one aspect I did enjoy - interactions of characters through character events. This brings lot of flavor to game and makes it more unpredictable.

RATING: 9
The mechanics are nothing really out of the ordinary, but they are put together in such a way, that in combination with the rich flavor texts, a compelling narrative must emerge. This is the only game that I know of, where winning or loosing is not really important.

It tells such a compelling story it is unbelievable!
For me this was one of my greatest solo game experiences ever.

This game is oozing in theme and playing always creates some great narratives. As a solitaire game my one tiny criticism is that it's quite long for a game that involves rolling lots and lots of dice. If the dice are against me early on in the game it can be a bit of a trawl to see it through to the end and the inevitable defeat.

2013-04-07 Very intrested in the subject... 5th Column has produced high quality games... conclusion this is a must have.

Update: Played a few games. Nice narrative. Basically a resource management exercise. Decent AI. Player Aids and tracks could definitely be better, cards should have more explanatory text to reduce constant look up for event flavor text. Not really a war game in my mind, but a WWII flavored version of one of the many co-op fight the invading enemies e.g. Defenders of the Realm, Space Alert, Pandemic, etc. Biggest plus is it is a great solo game.

For detailed comments please see my post in the Reviews section, "A Few Words on Codeword Cromwell." Here I'm dinging it a point for questionable decisions regarding components--namely the omission of key play details from the cards, lack of a SOP printed outside the rulebook, some color choices (the turn and Invasion markers blend right into the background), and so on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the best, if not the best, solitaire games I have played.  Dripping with theme and narrative, the setting and random events pull you into the perspective of villagers desperately fighting off German invaders and searching for the German spy among them.  On top of this, the game offers a satisfying and decision filled movement phase, including important sequencing of moves, tense movement activation rolls, and stacking considerations; all in an effort to get certain characters to join others, to get to the right building to activate an event, to move equipment around, or simply get them in the right place to kill Germans.  The game has a great deal of replayability (if not infinite) due to the many random events.  
Slight production knock for putting card text in separate book rather than on cards, otherwise production is beautiful.  I think the German spy sub plot is a brilliant addition, but may need a house rule to meet its full potential and avoid sameyness of always having the policy officer investigate and discover the banker (e.g., can only investigate characters under suspicion).  The choice between stalling the German invasion and activating events also feels gamey and I find myself choosing between trying to do better on an abstract scoring system or introducing another interesting bit of chrome.  But these two rough edges are more than rounded out by the chance to kill a Jerry with a cricket bat.

Having had the game for 2 years I finally got round to a first play. The rulebooks make the game appear more complicated than it actually is. Essentially the turn phases are easy to work through once you understand the flow. First few turns I needed to follow the rulebook for each phase but after that I was only using it for reference, A very thematic game and the large stack of character events ensure variability for every game. I delayed playing this game for a long while having found 'Where there is discord' thematic but unsatisfying. This game is better to my taste and I shall be playing it again. A recommended solo game.

This is from the same design team as 'Where There is Discord', and it is similarly hard to track down. This is a simulation of the British response to Seelowe (WWII German invasion), and is claimed to be based on training exercises developed for British officers.

Codeword Cromwell puts you in the game, makes you a part of the story. An amazing achievement. There is nothing new in this - it is a combination of other parts, but one that really works well. On the negative there is a lot to follow and remember, and this is a tough game to learn and play.

Update October 2017 - although there is a lot to love and admire about this, I found it was just a step too far for me, and with the play length and the rules depth, this was never going to get to the table, and was taking up too much space on the shelf, so traded.

Of his two games, I prefer Where There Is Discord - I think the game is easier to play, and with less rules referencing required it is easier to lose yourself in it than with this one.

RATING: 7.25
My first experience with a full on war game was with Codeword Cromwell. I really enjoyed the experience and found the rulebook clear in almost every regard (excepting only the enemy movement/infiltration aspect), and the experience was certainly immersive along the lines of my favorite boardgames, such as Cave Evil, Space Alert, and Mage Knight. Although I am new to this type of cardboard warfare and slower than many might be, I wonder if I will ever play a mission of Codeword Cromwell that clocks in at the estimated two hour mark...? I was defeated in the final turn of my first game, and would estimate my game was close to 6 hours, including internet reconnaissance missions to try to figure out a few of the rules. No small amount of time is spent laying German antagonist counters--roll to determine the orientation of their arrival, roll again to pinpoint the arrival spot, roll again to determine their number, which then requires referral to charts. And in later turns this process might happen four or five times for the 1/12th of a turn that is the enemy deployment phase. But to be clear the content of this game is much more than just fighting. 
My biggest gripe is regarding the multiple cross references that could have been cleaner had text been put on cards (and had certain rolls been instinctual rather than following a baroque number system (eg. not things like 3, 7, and 11 hit)). These choices obfuscate gameplay and slow down an already long game. My other criticism is for the digitally crafted illustrations in a medium that cries out for something that does not look computer rendered.  I wonder how many gamers want to look at a CG model on a piece of cardboard? It seems like the wrong choice for the audience in general and is definitely the wrong choice for my taste in a tactile board game.
The individualized nature of the flavor text (esp. the character cards) and their effects on play (sometimes extreme and sometimes mild) builds the story and depending on what happens, certain people in the resistance really start to take on more personality. Codeword Cromwell is more than just dice and counter combat, though there is a lot of that happening for sure. Overall, this narrative driven battlework fully met my hopes of what this sub-genre could offer and inspires me to play it again and seek out others.

So glad to have this!  I remember being delighted when this was first announced, what, five years ago?

And it was worth the wait.  It's a beautiful game and a very compelling solitaire experience.  There are some missteps -- the lack of a turn sequence, the multiple references to the Intelligence Briefing booklet on many turns -- but those are hardly insurmountable.  My biggest concern at this point is the balance between the tactical cards and the strategy cards.  Tactical cards just don't seem as useful as the ability to hold off waves of troops and tanks.  But they are a lot of fun.

Really, this is a worthy successor to WTiD and one I'm glad to own.  I think I'll get my money's worth out of it, and that's saying something.

The rules aren't perfect (there are edge cases, and an index/glossary of terms would help) - but this game genuinely does provide a great 'narrative' story, played out in a village.  There's some soap opera going on with the characters, and the home guard are nicely dad's army inefficient.  All wrapped in a nice chits-n-bits wargame (albeit one with a lot of dice).  Embrace the randomness and the story, not just the strategy of placing them, and there's a very entertaining game here.

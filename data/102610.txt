RATING: 7
Not bad at all. The I cut you choose and area control elements are reminiscent of San Marco, a favourite of mine. The sharing of cards is not quite so well done here.  There is less variety in the deck (essentially, either troops or money, plus you get a title), while a range of special powers and cards held over from previous turns makes it difficult to work out what your opponents need.  However as board position clarifies towards the end of the game, those seriously unbalanced cuts beloved of San Marco players become possible.  The titles are interesting because they determine turn order, which can be highly significant, and each has a different special power.

The area control element is pretty standard stuff, although there are decisions about playing for immediate points or for end game bonuses, and how thinly you can spread yourself.

The rules are very readable and left me with no questions.  Production is good, with tiles of a decent thickness and good quality cards.  I'm not very taken by the artwork, particularly the ink blotches and efforts to make cards and tiles look worn (or is that just my set?).

It's not broken, so it does not get a 1. It is however a pure exercise in pain, I'd rather spend the time listening to an iron glove on a blackboard. The "game" is pure mechanics and drier than the recitation of the dictionary, the use of the theme is a total turn off.

Analysis paralysis throughout the game... tough but fun! Not for action gamers.

RATING: 5
Would be better if some information were hidden. As it stands, only the two cards dealt to each player at the beginning of the game are unknown to everyone. Dividing 12 cards (in a four-player game) for selection with all players knowing what's being offered and what's left makes for a game oozing with the dreaded Analysis Paralysis. I suppose each offer could be composed in secret and viewed secretly, but the divider-player (Daimyo) would still essentially be deciding how many VP to give to a player. So you'd also have to deal everyone a troop card face-down each round and reduce the number of cards divided up for offer. I think I'll try it.

The unsung gem of Essen 2011. Why is no one talking about this game? It's a much less chaotic San Marco. The art is great, the components look good. The game play is engaging and decisions are difficult.

It was a real hit with my game group.

RATING: 6
There is an interesting game here, but the downtime is DEADLY.  The first action is to create a grouping to offer.  A lot of thought is needed, and all the possibilities need to be thought through.  Realistically, this means making four roughly equal piles.  After the first take you may want to make another set of splits based on who took it, or perhaps a new person will have to split if the splitter gets stuck with it.  Repeat that another time and you have merely one of many turns.  Thankfully, taking the actual actions is a little faster.  I think it will be interesting to try where you don't expose all the card, but the splitter merely offers a set from a hidden group.  I think this will make the splitter role more interesting, lead to some bluffing possiblities, and make it more interesting overall.  But it wouldn't fix the downtime issue.  One further problem is a complete lack of catch-up mechanism.  I'm looking forward to further plays to see how this will ultimately fall.

I originally got this game because it helped me get some free shipping, but I knew nothing about it.  It sat on my shelf for a good year until last night when I finally got to play it.

Shitenno is great - it basically has this anti-drafting thing where the start player (daimyo) takes all the resources for the round and divides them among the group by creating individual "lots" and passing them around in player order.  There is so much delicious stress from the tactical dilemma of being the daimyo - offer little to the other players and you might get stuck with your own crappy lot; offer too much and you help create a runaway leader; in every approach, you need to keep in mind not only what you're giving away, but what you might be left with.  As the receiver, you have important decisions to make as well - do the cards offered get you anywhere?  Is the offered position in turn order and its special ability outweigh the cards?  Do you pass on something you know someone else needs in favor of you getting something better?

Once all this is done, everyone gets a chance at placing some control down in standard fashion, but the available special abilities of what you got in the "parceling" round can make all the difference to what you can do.

Lots of great choices here and I'm surprised it's not a big hit with others.

RATING: 6
The nearest comparison I have to this game is San Marco.  I like San Marco with 3 better, but I like this better than San Marco with 4.  I found that there was slightly more "take that" than I want in a game (resulting from the ability to double the influence of one of your tiles.)

RATING: 5.5
Rating based upon one play in the halls at Essen.  Reasonably good and solid - some things to understand and appreciate which would alter a second game play - but nothing that stood out for me on a personal basis to want to buy it.  At times felt like an abstract with the Japanese theme blended onto it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very simple area control via set collection game however what makes shitenno very interesting bis the card mechanic whereby the daimyo draws all the cards and splits them offering it first to the other players and if none accept having to take them himself.

This "I split you choose" mechanic is really nice and elevates the gameplay, although I have noticed that this is a skill that a player either gets or really doesn't.

Artwork is not great and the tokens are a little small but overall a very enjoyable game.

Shitenno is a fairly pure implementation of "I split, you choose." One player bundles card packages, and the other players can pick those they like with the dregs (or what the other players think of as dregs) going to the bundling player himself.

The conquest of provinces and the area majority game are most simple, and therein lies the one possible downside of the game: The most interesting and engaging part is, quite obviously, the sharing of the cards, and while one player is occupied with figuring out the best card distribution everyone else is just waiting. With a slow splitter that is going to be painful. If everyone plays briskly, however, the game zips along nicely and presents quite a few agonizing choices.

It's a novel implementation of the I-split/you-choose mechanic, to be sure, but I don't think there's enough information on which to base your "offers." So, it's usually best to make the splits roughly even and hope no one gets lucky with card combinations.

Great game that doesn't seem to get the attention it deserves. Everything works very well and got nice graphics.

There's only one problem with the game and that's AP. Also, the more players, the more time will be needed, while you can't do anything if it's not your turn. Try the game with a timer to get rid of this problem.

Away from that, Shitenno is a great game and if it will work with a timer, woohoo!

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2014)

What a surprising game! I didn’t had it on my radar AT ALL so I was reluctant to play it, however I’m glad I did.  The game components are very good, the Japanese setting, art and theme is also pretty good, but the gameplay is GREAT! This is the first time I enjoy a game of I split/you choose mechanism. 

Luck plays a minor role (furthermore if you have a good memory), but the decisions are gut wrenching when you are the player making the gifts and merely hard when you are the player receiving the gifts. 

I’m a bit concerned that king making can occur recurrently, that is, I feel that players need to have the same level of experience, otherwise some players can benefit unfairly from the gifts of the less experienced player. Shitenno is best with 4 players.

Bottom line, a game I enjoy a lot. Perhaps this will make my list of favorite games of 2011. I would like to buy the game.

After more plays, Shitenno is now a borderline 7.0 to me. Still a good game but I hate the kingmaking that appears to be prominent in the game. In my last game a player gifted away 4/5 of the available cards so he finished last but he hurt every player but the one receiving the cards. To avoid this, all the players need to try their best every time, no matter that they can’t win. Otherwise it will be a Kingmaking fest that I will try to avoid.

Another small issue is that sometime the game can suffer from long downtime due to some player thinking a lot.

Still I love the game and I already bought it. 

One of 2011´s favorites.

After a video review: It's basically a cut and split game. The main player chose to give cards to other players. It feels like a nice Mechanics of Junta style game. Then you simply use the cards to control stuff on the board. Seems very abstract and do not like much the card splitting mechanism.

Good looking game, easy to explain.

The game itself can be a real brain burner - may be too much of one for me.  

First, there is the difficulty of figuring out what hand to take/give during the deal.
2nd, you need to decide what hierarchy card you want to try to get the next turn as turn order is critical.
3rd, you need to have an idea of what troop cards your opponents are trying to get.
4th, you need to be able to guess when the game is going to end at least 1 full turn ahead of time.

Je ne connais pas San Marco, je ne peux donc pas comparer les deux. Petit sentiment de "king making" durant la partie - surtout à la fin.

J'y rejouerais, mais j'aimerais essayer à quatre joueurs.

This features the same Solomon's Choice mechanic that made San Marco so downtime-tiresome, yet this is ranked in the 2000's and SM is ranked in the 200's. Go figure. Both games are marked by a really engaging choice when you're the one dividing up the lots, but which is complete and utter non-fun deadtime for the others while the loooong decision is made. Meaning both games end up a 6 for me, and probably lucky to be that. At least in this game there's only two card types to choose between - troops or VPs - which theoretically makes things easier. But in practice, getting the colour splits right vis a vis what's needed to claim an area on the board (taking into account what players have left over from previous turns + what bonus tiles they have left) still makes it difficult. It provides a nice twist in that turn order (and the special action that goes with that order slot) is included in each lot. As usual in these types of games, the first few turns are interesting and then become more tiresome as the game progresses, the scoring escalates, the importance of the lot-splits increases, and downtime escalates exponentially. The rules are fine, components are nice, but it felt fully explored after a single game.

My issue with the split-and-choose mechanic is when one player is doing the splitting, the other players have *nothing* to do but wait. This is even more frustrating in this game because players cannot see how the cards are being split.

There doesn't seem to be much long-term strategy as you can only play two tokens per turn, which means you can't really hoard cards (and how the game is structure, if you were allowed to hoard cards, it would break the game).

A very nice variation on the San Marco "I cut-you choose" mechanic. The choices for the cutter are actually a little bit more straightforward (you may view this as a pro, or a con--I would vote "pro"). I like San Marco better in the end, but would happily play Shitenno. Fun game. As with most of these style of games, I suspect 3-player works best.

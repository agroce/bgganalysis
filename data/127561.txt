With this new base set, Resident Evil really becomes a great deck builder whereas it used to be one of those "fun but very flawed" games.

RATING: N/A
The final expansion of the Resident Deck Building Game actually is the best balanced one, in my opinion. I feel everything meshes well, and as a standalone, it works very well.

RATING: 8

Not one of the best deck building games but definitely the most thematic. Certainly worth trying. 
It is one of the games where you have to optimize the most and it can seem nearly impossible for newbies to slay the villian in story mode.

Update: I now own every expansion and has upgraded the rating to 8.

This doesn't strike me as dramatically different than the Base Game. Although, I do think the EXP and Skill system do add something good to the equation.

I have come to the conclusion that I just don't like deck-building games.

I played a mercenaries game of this and it feels very much like the standard game however there is a turn timer.

They have slowed the game down and there are less actions that give you more actions and thus it is more difficult to play your whole deck in a single turn. 

The new knife/gun in the starting decks are self thinning and really quite nice, and the gold/ammo card having abilities that go off when certain conditions are met is really really nice, however overall I was unimpressed as its still just playing with yourself for and hour and a half as there is very little player interaction.

Good game, but the skills make the characters so broke that you lost some replayability

Adds a few new elements, such as skills, in the quest to slay zombies.

This standalone expansion is an improvement over previous releases. The rule book is no longer full of typos. They even cleared up a lot of mess and misprints which were found in the previous sets. All in all, a very good set. A++

Now that I have the base set, Alliance, Mercenaries, Nightmare and Outbreak, Resident Evil has become my favourite deck building game.
Mercenaries introduce Skills which are a nice addition.  You gain XP every time you explore.  You can use your XP to activate skills.  Some Action cards are improve if you have or spend XP.  The new amunition cards with a special effect are also a nice addition.
The box is well done and can contain all the cards from previous sets.  It contain divider with the name of all the cards, I draw from this deck randomly to have a different Ressource area every game.
My favourite action from Mercenaries are Backstab, Boundless Battlefield and The Mercenaries.  If playing Mercenary mode Melee can help you reach new high score! 
The Custom Bolt-Action Rifle is my favourite rifle from all the set that I have.

As said, RE DBG is amazing, and even with so many years, it 's still the best DBG.

This is sadly, the last expansion, I really wish Bandai had done more...I don't know which was the problem but it surely could come back now that there are so many examples of Deck Building Games making money, king should return!

This expansion shows a big effort to add  playability, it has a skill system similar to the one on RE6, that is optional and sure adds a lot of replay value, basic resources were improved by adding effects on them that add more pace to the game, and you are reading well: it has 3 mansions!!! easy, normal and hard difficulty (of course you can mix it), with very interesting effect, and the Boss has maybe the best effect or all bosses, he is perfect to mix with every other expansion.

Maybe the only drawback is the characters have a lot of health, it is perfectly explained because they have only one effect and you can use the skill system, but even when the game is really balanced, it would be better for them to keep the same range for health (in this expansion even 70 wouldnÂ´t have risk of one hit death). 

Definetely an excellent expansion, also a very good one to start with this saga, specially is not very expensive.

RATING: 7.75
The best "base" version of the game to buy. Includes skills which greatly improves how you deal with encounters and adds more replay than the original does. Also gives a few varied mansion setups in one box, which is a plus

What I don't like is the smaller character pool this one gives, and the fact that these characters have only one printed ability.

RATING: 4
Astounded that this one is rated over 7. Have not found a group yet that like the Mercenaries play mode or the skill drafting gimmick. Building "chains" is too easy with the weak zombies in the mansion, and one unlucky draw will completely screw a team over. Poor weapon variety.

To each their own!

Only trading with Alliances/Mercenaries/Outbreak/Nightmare. Boxes show some wear, but cards are in great condition. Can combine into fewer boxes for cheaper shipping if desired.

The new skill system is super fun to play with. The introduction of 3 new mansions is pretty cool as well. This set introduces a lot of much needed variety to the game.

RATING: 2
Worst expansion for the RE-DBG.

Introduces characters with trackable experience and variable powers. Both of these elements do nothing except add fiddly rules and components to the game, increasing set-up time and slowing down play.

RATING: 8
Mercenaries brings the Skill cards which is really cool. I like the drafting at set-up so each player can select 3 skills out of 5 drafted cards. These help line out a strategy and boost the character abilities. Haven't fully explored this yet but am really eager to discover the synergies these cards may built with character abilities and other cards.

Very cool! Also comes with a modal mansion that has different levels and types of interaction with players! Awesome! :)

There are better DBG's out there but I like the theme and all of it is sleeved and condensed to a single box so it looks sexy.

RATING: 7
A massive overhaul of the original Resident Evil DBG.
The new skill/weapons/ammo mechanics allows for a significantly faster start of the game where players are able to start exploring the mansion rather than the original game which often had several turns of just purchasing better gear to be able to survive exploring.
This has streamlined the game and made it much more fun to play.
Some players might miss the concept of the "special upgraded" weapon that gets shuffled into the stack of available weaponry, but I believe that it doesn't penalize the player who purchased the item prior to it and gets stuck with no buys/gold when the super-variant gets revealed next.

Not bad, though a bit light on content.  There's quite a bit of empty space in the box, presumably to give one room for storing expansions.  This is a decent deck-building game, though not really my favorite.

The infection cards from outbreak, the new skill system and user GibbRS "Hunted" rule (with some minor tweaks) makes this a real fun game.

The new ammo cards really speed things up.

The basic cards in this set are required to play as they certainly speed up the first part of the game. I am a little disappointed in the skill system, but I think these are the most balanced mansions of the series. Must have expansion if you like the REDBG.

Resident Evil 4 was one of the best FPS games I had played on the Playstation 2.

When I saw there was a card-game, (a deck-builder no less), that drew from the Resident Evil license, then I knew I would want to try it. I was glad I did.

The game adds nothing really new to these types of deckbuilding games. You have a starting deck, an encounter deck (where the baddies are), and a storehouse of several cards that may be purchased each round to add to your arsenal or abilities to win.
What this game DOES have, is that sense of dread, or spookyness that the Resident Evil stories are known for. You have all of the familiar weeds for health, guns, ammo, and other recognizable articles from the video series. You also have those terrific people from the games.

I do enjoy this game as a challenge to beat. Even though being familiar with the video game series may bring its own attribute to enjoying this card game, I do think that if someone enjoys the theme and deckbuilding in general without having any knowledge of the video series, that they may still find much to enjoy with this creepy take on the modern deck-building mechanism.

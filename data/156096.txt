Oh wow this can be FANTASTIC!  *can be*  You are a salesman and you have 30 seconds or more to make your pitch.  Will the customer buy your product?  It's sort of like a story telling game but way funner.

One of my jobs was selling a Kitten Skull to a Dog.  Really?  What dog wouldn't love a Kitten Skull.  Sells itself, really.

Played once with the game night crew.  Game was fun but I don't know just how often I'd want to bring it out.

RATING: 5.5
I had high expectations for this game but was very disappointed in actual play since it mostly comes down to having the better product for the customer than the best pitch.

Same game, more cards. Everyone I play Snake oil with loves it.

It needs the right group but, if you can muster it, this is an amazing party game. I've had such a laugh playing this with friends. It's like CAH but you have to use imagination and a bit of patter rather than having the jokes cued up for you.

Ok family-party style game. This is the stripped down version, where the others have many more cards. I'd suggest getting one of those instead.

Always good for some laughs, but we need more cards for variety

Playing Snake Oil, you blow through the entire deck of cards pretty quickly. This expansion gives you some more cards to play through. While the publisher claims this version is more geared towards younger players, I just don't see any difference and still see opportunities for some more adult combinations. It should be noted that the card backs are green rather than blue but I don't think it affects gameplay.

Hilarious family fun! We all really love this one and it's a hoot to play with our girls. Don't think we will ever tire of this one. Excellent!

Simple creativity. Kids love it. Can see that the cards in this version will feel limited after a few plays, but who cares... I probably won't play that much anyway!

7 Plays - I've always played with this exp. This expansion is just essentially offering "more stuff", which is great for this game and really helps build variety for those who have played a number of times. 

The ruleset also comes with some great 'variant' rules (which you could simply implement with the base game also)for very large groups, like a school, youth or hobby group etc. 

I also like that this is super family friendly, but can be made NSFW easily with people who are of that mind.

Just more cards for the game to extend its life a bit.  More party games should introduce new content like this.

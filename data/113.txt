I have to play again to have a clearer opinion about the game. My impression (I played it a few years ago) is that it has some resemblance with Sticheln, but I like Sticheln better.

RATING: 8
A favourite trick-taking game.  The division of a trick between players of the high and low cards is similar to David & Goliath.  However, there is no requirement to follow suit and high gets their choice of cards, allowing much more scope for clever play. In D&G you try to limit the number of cards of each colour collected, in Mit List you want as many cards as possible in just two suits.  A cruel touch is that when you collect cards of all four suits you must immediately declare which two will score positively.

Open information trick taking game which felt a bit demanding for those who have not been playing a lot of similar games. My biggest issue with it is the scoring which is mathy.

Very decent trick taking game with, as you'll suspect, a twist. Rating could well improve with further play.  

... now uprated a notch.  Very hard to get right - which is a positive - and look forward to playing more.

One play.  Has a feel of Sticheln (card play) crossed with Coloretto (scoring) for me.  Our one play was very late at night and slow moving otherwise I think I'd rate it higher.  Looking forward to another play.

メイフォローの名作。トリックにおける最強と中庸と最弱のそれぞれに意味があって考えどころが多く手応えのあるゲーム。得点方法は、2スートの枚数の乗算を、その他のスート枚数で割るというダイナミックかつ凹みすぎない秀逸なシステム。
6人は多すぎる。5人が好き。4人でもいい。

Have to say that I really didn't enjoy this one. We played with 6 players, and you're supposed to play 6 rounds of the game while keeping track of score - I was losing the will to live half-way through the first.

A truly horrible set-collecting game, in my opinion.  The idea is to collect lots of cards in two colours, while keeping a small pile of the other coloured cards.  The problem for me was that there are too many cards in the deck, and people were taking a long time to decide what to play - in my opinion trick taking games should be very fast paced!  The game took ages (an hour to play 3 rounds) and we gave up at the half-way stage.  Cannot recommend this game to anyone, unfortunately.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very solid and interesting trick-taker, with relatively simple rules compared to something like Mu (which I love). Seems like it works very well with 6, which is rare for a trick-taker. Position seems pretty important - as in poker, I think you benefit from acting late in a hand. My only knock is that it is somewhat thinky/brain-burny - so although it plays well with 6, it's not a very talky game. (I think of Mu and Sticheln as more complicated but more social.)

Combined with a strong emphasis on tactics at the expense of strategy, The evaluation skills required to play trick taking games escape me, and I'm not interested in pursuing them. I'd rather play [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16632/gops]GOPS[/url] or any of it's reimplementations

NOV09. I do like this card game but I am dreadful at it - often scoring only 4 - 6 per hand while those around me are scoring 30+.

Only thing to do is play it more often to get better at it!

I wish the game moved faster.  We can only get in a few hands during our lunch hour.  Playing the number of hands = number of players takes about 20 minutes per player -- and this seems just a bit too long.

Another in a long line of variations on the trick-taking theme.  This game is distinguished from the pack by its constantly changing trump suits, its trick-splitting and its lack of partnership.

Better than David & Goliath. Actually this is quite fun trick-taking game. A little issue is the last couple of tricks which might ruin your good scores without giving you any chances...

although I've not played this yet, it's a great card game to have b/c of the long run in each suit, which can be used to play, design, or test many card games.

RATING: 7
Excellent 6 player card game which breaks all normal rules of card play.  Players never have to follow in the suit led (this took me a while to wrap my head around).  Whatever color is led by start player is considered trump.  Highest card will choose 3 cards to collect from trick.  Lowest card of a different color takes the remaining 3 cards and leads the next round.  The idea is to collect as many cards as possible in two of the four colors.  You score by multiplying the quantity of the two colors of which you collected the most and divide by the quantity of the sum of the other two colors.

Decent trick-taking game from a guy who created many of them but couldn't ever surpass one of his earliest games: Sticheln.  There is a game here however and once you get the hang of it I found that there were some significant decisions.  I like how two people win each trick and how the first winner choooses the first cards for his bounty leaving the second winner with the dregs.  However a good second winner can calculate what cards will be left for him.

Cool trick taking mechanic. You don't always want to decide early what suits you're going to be strong in, sometimes what other people play will greatly affect that decision. Sometimes it's good to play cards to force others to take extra cards in their weak suits. It can be good to sacrifice a few points for yourself to take away alot of points from another player. I still don't feel like I really understand how this one plays. Probably the most difficult trick taking game I know.

RATING: 6
This is one we play for variety, but not a game that gives you a sense of control. The ability to play anything gives the player going last the ability to pus those going earlier, which encourages the leads to be conservative, the inverse of normal. That power seems overwhelming at times, especially as it just takes one slip-up (whether forced on you or accidental) to really impact your score. Still, enough twists to be enjoyable in the occasional outing.

RATING: 3
Rating based on one play (6 players). Seriously, I don't think this game has much purpose to exist. There are much more solid, tried-and-true, more-well-known trick-taking card games out there (Spades, Hearts) that don't involve buying a new deck of cards, and familiarizing all players with the quirks of this game.  The most frustrating part of this game is that I felt no ability to dictate the cardplay whatsoever. Even if you have a killer hand (all high or all low) you can be screwed based on what the other players happen to choose to throw down, since they don't have to follow suit. 
People frequently won good cards even after playing a bad one, and won bad cards after playing a good one. Throw in the overwhelming luck factor, the weak components, and the too-long-for-what-it-is game length, and a standard deck of themed cards holds much greater (and well-known) games.

[Berliner Spielkarten 1999 edition] {trick-taking; optimal 4p} MLT is a twisted trick-taking game. It's fun, interactive and quite nasty. The scoring rule is very special (though some players may need a calculator) which forces players to take a trick carefully. Fans of trick-taking games shall not miss this game. I like it more than "David and Goliath", which is a similar game for me.

The illustration is pedestrian.

Once you get your mind around the twists in Mit List und Tücke, the game feels so simple as to be a children's game.  The art doesn't help, but it plays 6 as good filler.

RATING: 7
Rating based only on the 4 player game (looking forward to trying it with 5 and 6). I like this a lot more the Palesch's other better known trick taking game, Hattrick. The way that you score (multiplying the two suits you are collecting and then dividing by the rest) allows for potential high scoring hands, and the ability to recover from several bad hands. Lots of interesting unique mechanisms, but not that complex. Certainly less complex than Mue or Was Sticht, with their dual trump rules.

RATING: 7
The David & Goliath-like system was a little hard for me to easily grasp, but I think that's a good thing. One of the few games I know that uses a multiply-and-divide scoring system. Even at the end of my first (and so far, only) game of this, I found myself at a loss as to what's a good play.

This is a trick-taking game that appears to be a blend of Sticheln and David & Goliath, with a fiddly and/or convoluted scoring mechanism (take your pick).  It seems overly complicated at first, but further plays may make it more second-nature.

Courtier has a Ticket to Ride vibe IMO. You've got a personal (randomly drawn) petition card with some goals you'll get veeps for fulfilling, and there's some public petition cards that anyone can fulfill at any time. But there is much more strategy in how/when to play cards and move your cubes/influence around to gain and lose abilities in this game than there is in sticking trains on lines a la TtR.

Honestly, I found the play of the game pretty decent, but the heavy luck factor of what petition cards are available (and come out to be available) pushes it down to average for me. It can make it far too swingy IMO who the petition cards are randomly favoring as they are pulled, and there's no mechanic for replacing or adding to your private petition goals to get around being cornered by unfavorable petitions. You can certainly try to play around this to some degree, but my impression was 'eh'.

Initial impressions after first (and probably last) play. 
Its an area control eurogame where players try to influence various characters on the board using cards. Courtier is very chaotic because by the time turn order gets back to you, the main board has completely changed. The game is also very luck dependant. The random cards you draw dictate where you can place your influence. 

Luck + Chaos is a recipe for disaster.

Love the artwork. The simplicity of game play is awesome. And just cut-throat enough for us to like it. But in a 2-player game it becomes wildly unbalanced because of those coterie cards. And this game began to make us understand that area control games just don't typically support 2 players.

The theme of this game (and series) is intriguing.  Take a fictional world and create games that are about that world.  As the 1st in the series, this game does a nice job of introducing the various factions in the game world.  Visually the game is good, but the art work feels a bit dated.  Some of that is intentional.  While the artwork may or may not draw players in, the game play should.  Players vie for control / influence of the factions.  This is done through card drafting and placement.  Game play feels balanced and game length is appropriate for the experience.  Depth of strategy can be seen as either lighter or heavier depending on player perception, but is likely best defined as middle of the road.  Overall, I enjoy the game play, but am personally more intrigued by the creation process than the game itself.

We don't play many area control games so this is a nice change for us. We also like that there's quite a bit of interaction between players. The game board evolves from turn to turn so you need to pay attention. Our second game of this seemed like it only took about 30 minutes. It's a good game and the rating may go up over time.

Subtle tug-o-war.  Only one play, but was a fun game.  True that it does start up a bit slow...but is nice to watch how the board develops out and how players manipulate their cards to shift the influence around the board.

I would imagine that this game opens up a bit with multiple plays, as people would understand the cards (without have to read them all the time) and combinations become apparent.

I was excited to play this because I love the Tempest universe and this was given to me as a birthday gift. Unfortunately I found it a little disappointing. The theme is nonexistent, and after a few rounds the game begins to feel like an abstract. Turns get very repetitive after a while, as you continue to do the same thing again and again, sometimes removing someone's cube from a space just to have them do the same to you on their turn.

UPDATE: Tried this with three players. Totally stupid, random game. The "gossip" cards are so ridiculously swingy, often giving a player an instant contract because of the Minister space, and since the neutral cubes eventually fill up the entire board, the entire game is a crapshoot. This is Revolution's pretty, but hideously flawed and vastly inferior cousin. And that's coming from someone who didn't even really like Revolution. Sold.

Again a very good game. I like that it plays quicker than Dominare but having a similar feel... It's a very different game, with different mechanics, but for some reason gives me the feeling of Dominare. It's the Tempest setting but I am fine with boiling it down to that essence. Another game I will play very happily. In fact I want to play it more to see how it plays out differently on subsequent plays.

Another winner from the Tempest series, this one is a bit more complex and takes a game to appreciate and understand the strategies involved.  In our first play we had a key rule wrong for half the game which made things much better once we corrected for it.

Basically you're using cards to influence various courtiers, or to move that support around.  Strategic and timely use of that influence will help you complete mission cards, which is the primary vehicle for scoring points.

This won't be a favorite game but it's one I plan on keeping in our collection - the beautiful board alone is worth it.

Was shopping around at a recycle/second hand shop in the capital city of our prefecture. Stumbled across this game--in English-- for ¥1000. No idea how this game got there or much about tbr game save the art on the box looked similar to Love Letter (Lo and behold find out it is the same artist), but board games and English and not being exorbitantly expensive-- we had to pick it up. Just hope we enjoy it once we get it to the table. XD

I loved Lover Letter so I thought this game being in the same world as it would have a great gameplay but it's just mediocre.  I can see what they were trying to do with it and it would be more fun if they were able to fix a few aspects of the game so it didn't feel like players were just grinding things out rather than having actual fun.

I prefer it to its cousin, Dominare. In both games, areas of the board confer different benefits on the players who control those areas, and the constantly shifting control can be disorienting. Courtier is card-heavy, but the cards fortunately are used more to designate placements than to break rules.

Not sure if this is a light euro or if it has more bite to it than first appears. As an influence placement game, there's not much new here, but the twists seems to be the extra power that some of the grouping give you combined with the Action cards. I like that every time a Petition is claimed it brings the end of the game closer and it fills up some of the Characters, but this can lead to unpredictable "waterfall" effect, as most of the time it will cause 2-3 other Petition to be quickly claimed.

RATING: 8.5
This game is simply amazing and grossly underrated on the geek.  Played this as a 4 player game and it was amazingly cutthroat, frustrating as times as the people you need are exchanged (in a good way). Cards change hands quickly making ownership of regions important, and the fact that the game can end at any time adds to the immediate need to act now and worry about retribution later.  An amazing little game!

Played 3 player and is much faster - still very balanced.
Played 2 player and balances well, but would recommend the variant where you need at least 1 cube of your color to use the courtier (instead of all neutral).

Tactical game - as things can change dramatically opening or closing opportunities just before your turn. Playing time is consequently longer than written on the box. I can't realistically see a four player game finish in under an hour - the time of 45 minutes is wildly inaccurate. A good game - but not compelling.
Note: Text size on the cards is of a good size and readable - a major plus. Unfortunately some graphic designer then stuffed up and put dark text on dark backgrounds for the Courtier names on the Petition Cards - making reading them, if they are not in your hand, very difficult - and most of them are placed on the table for everyone to "see".

Area control that works well for 2 players.  Mostly a competition for special powers and to steal your opponents so they don't hog the best ones all game.  Scoring requires relinquishing your control so the game provides a nice dynamic fluidity for area control.  Quick.  Theme is lacking.

This makes pushing cubes fun and, I know it's petty, but I love the colors Alderac has chosen. Area of control is called influence here, and the special powers you vie for are on handy cards that rest right in front of the player who has claimed them. Finally, the pulling of the queen card stacked near the bottom of the deck makes for an excitingly abrupt way to end to the game.

For me, this game fails miserably on the luck-skill ratio. The game needs you to think hard about what to do each turn, then essentially picks all the pieces up and throws them in the air before you next go. I like thinky games, I like hugely luck based games, but this tries to do too much of both and gets it wrong.

Quasi worker placement area control game.  Place workers to dominate a character, score points for dominating certain figures at court.

A game about subtle political manipulations that doesn't contain any subtle political manipulations. I guess that might be unfair, since I don't complain about war games that don't have actual combat in them. 

Also Venice never had a hereditary monarchy that I'm aware of. I'm not sure why that bothers me, but it does. It just seems like the Tempest series of games were very slapdash and lazy, typified by the fact that they never noticed their fantasy counterpart of Venice was nothing like Venice.

Two plays in and I think I've got the mechanics (which are good) and cards/powers down now, but it still seems a little slow with four players with a fair amount of downtime between turns. 

I'd rate it higher with less downtime and maybe less randomness (the fashion cards that fill the coteries with neutral cubes can have a much greater effect on play than the player choices do, especially towards the end game) as the actual game play is good.

While I was expecting an area control game with some direct targeting, Courtier actually is a puzzle-solving game. Each turn, players have to figure out how to play their cards to claim one of the available petitions, either this turn or set themselves up for one of the next turns. After six to twelve petitions have been claimed, the game is over. Eliminating the influence of other players to gain own influence is simply one part of the puzzle, not a mean in itself. So far, so good.

Where Courtier disappoints, is in the lack of polishing. The pacing is off. It takes one third of the game before the first petition can be claimed. With the neutral cubes introduced after every fulfilled petition, the game speeds up and can be over after the second third without any warning if the "Queen is arrested"-card is turned over at the earliest possibility. There's no compensation for player order which would be necessary given the importance of claiming one more petition when the winner probably will have between three and four of them. Two of the three possible actions will usually not be chosen as it rarely makes sense to not play a card. The board state changes too much for the majority battle to be interesting.

Still, the occasional gamers in my group enjoyed the game. Entertaining as a puzzle with a chaos factor if you don't mind a rather random result.

Pretty straight-forward area control driven by cardplay.

Manages the random aspect of card-draws really well, and I never feel like I get hosed by someones lucky hand. There’s a nifty catch-up mechanic in how you lose control when completing petitions, often resulting in giving up faction-abilities to an opponent.

It's slow at first but picks up speed once the queen adds her neutral cubes. Time can also be somewhat modular by reducing the number of fashion cards, but I always prefer a full game. Fun all the way.

Swaying a court to my cause is one of my favorite themes and this is currently one of my favorite games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A not bad area influence/hand management game. The hand management aspect makes it so often you can put an influence cube on a spot without someone immediately contesting it, and the special powers for having majority are pretty neat. The queen event cards dramatically change up the game a bit too much as there are times a person can score after one of those cards without having to place any cubes at all due to the large amount of neutral influence cubes that can be added.

I'm shocked by how much I didn't like this game. With four players going for (mostly) the same goals and some of the requirements only fitting one or two, there is constant back and forth on who controls the individual courtiers. Since most goals require four courtiers, there is a constant tug-of-war to complete any.

I feel good about having cards to get me all the influence I need to complete a goal. Oh, two of them are taken away from me before I complete it, probably by opponents who don't even know they are messing with me. No problem, I have six cards to meet the four goals, I can recover. Oh, I wasted all the cards trading back and forth with one or two other players. I've played six, seven cards and got no where. Eventually someone will get lucky and get one. Yay.

I've only played once, I won by a long shot, and it wasn't fun. Luck, luck, luck.

Wacky area control with a whole range of special abilities, to the extent where you'll need all your focus just to keep track of what moves are legally available to you.

Was not very good. Play is rather obvious, luck factor (card draw) seems to outweigh all other considerations. Provided players stay awake, the winner will be whoever is luckiest. Would play again if there were no better options, but unlikely to seek a game.

WOW !!  COURTIER ROCKS !! Card/boardgame about placing influence cubes on people of the Tempest world to complete petitions(/objectives) for points. If you're to play just one boardgame from the Tempest series, PLAY COURTIER !! Plan for your plans to be thwarted in this game. Not for the feint of heart.

Definitely NOT a gateway game, nor multiplayer solitaire. Games can go longer than expected; double for a learning game.

After the pleasant acquaintance with Mercante, I looked forward to play another game from the 'Tempest'-line. This is OK, but certainly not as good as Mercante. This is more an 'elbow'-game: if you need the same courtier as an other player (and can't take the Minister or have a card that lets you skip him for an influence cube), you can keep on screwing eachother :s

Plus for this game is the playing time: less then an hour with 4 unexperienced players is just the right amount of screwing time :D

Both an improvement and a drawback from Revolution. On the one end it has a whole lot more structure and thus make for a more pleasant and balanced play. On the other hand, it takes away the excitement of Revolution. This, of course, means I am keeping both. Good game.

A pleasant, interesting area control game.  I like the idea that you're competing with other players to complete a pool of common goals while working on your own secret goal...it lowers the screwage, and allows for some psychological warfare on your opponents without making it a outright bloodfest.  Clever theme and beautiful art.  Probably my favorite of the Tempest games I've played.

Very chaotic and tactical influence placement game. Come up with a vague plan, play a cube, grab a special ability, watch a bunch of influence change place, lose the special ability, watch someone fulfill a petition,  watch bunch of courtiers fill up, then it's back to your turn again.

Courtier is the antithesis of the multiplayer solitaire engine-building game. You are relentlessly foiling other players and pulling the rug out from under them. The real plan-destroyer is the Queen's Fashion cards that dump influence markers all over the board and open up random scoring cards. It's a major triumph in Courtier when you manage a plan that takes three actions in succession. But that won't happen often.

The attractive production and design goes a long way to making the spoonful of chaos go down smoothly. There's nothing ugly, dull or tedious about it. However, Courtier will play best as a light opener for players familiar with the game who can knock it off in 45 min.

Aug. '13: Played with the graphic designer at 2013 GenCon during the AEG party.  Definitely don't want this one.  Too much looking all over the board and at others' cards to count and figure out best way to swing things.  Not my kind of game.  But I do think it's cool that AEG's trying to create multiple games from same universe.

23-04-2015. Rated after 1 recent play. Think I played it 3-4 times.

Courtier is a simple area control game in which you try to influence certain courtiers with influence cubes. Courtiers come in 'houses', collections of courtiers of the same color based on their respective relationships. If you have majority within a set of those courtiers, you get their ability.

You case in VP cards if you have most influence in sets of 2 and 3 courtiers. If you manage, you remove all influence on those cards, get VPs and flip a card from the deck. This fills up certain courtiers with neutral influence cubes and makes sure there is a end card shuffled in the last 7 or so.

I think courtier is ok. I do like the game a bit. But it's funky. It can start sloooowww.. and come to a sudden burn. Artwork is good.

A Tempest sorozat első darabja egy városállam királyi udvarának életét állítja a középpontba. A játékosok az egyes udvaroncok felett gyakorolt befolyásukat akarják növelni (igazából kártyákat játszanak ki és fa kockákat raknak a táblára), hogy meghatározott csoportok petícióval éljenek... lényegében a királynő hűségét firtatva, akinek letartóztatása elkerülhetetlen a játékban. Ha egy összetartozó csoportban (pl. katonák, tudósok, művészek) nekünk vana legnagyobb szavunk, egy különleges képességet is nyerünk általuk - de mivel a sikeres petíciók, vagy a többi játékos leveheti a befolyásjelzőinket, ez sosem tart sokáig!
Nem túl komplikált, európai stílusú játék, ahol a kártyahúzás a szerencsefaktor, a befolyás az erőforrás. Két játékossal nem a legjobb, az "automatizált" harmadik játékos igazgatása ugyanis elég nagy nyűg.

Something between Dominare and Discworld. It card driven area control game where cards play you. The art is uninspired and doesn't evoke anything - a problem with the whole Tempest series, but even more so here (characters on board float in nondescript space).   

That's really it. Revolution! is a game similarly chaotic, but the chaos is there in the hands of players, whereas here it's created by game effects (cards). 

EDIT: a month has passed and I have no idea what this game is about. Dominare is the better one. 

EDIT 2: reason this has fallen to 1.0 - I actually have no idea, it's just instinctive gut reaction when I vaguely remember the game (what remained in memory at all I tried to suppress and delete) that's it's something totally derivative and dull. Or that could be just the artwork. As I've said, I tried to suppress my memory of this game.

1 play (MACE)

This is an area control game, but with some interesting additions: having a majority in an area gives you a special power; you have to give up some control to score VP; each area is made of several characters, each with their own area-majority. The game play was quite enjoyable! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board shows several families/groups (different colors), each with several members -- courtiers -- each of whom have 1-4 spaces for influence cubes. Shuffle 12 random Fashion cards, with the game end card mixed randomly into the bottom 6. Shuffle the deck of Petition cards,  place 4 face up in Display, and give each player 1 face down. Shuffle the influence and power decks and place the top cards of each face up nearby. Players also get 15 influence cubes each, and 5 influence/power cards. 

On your turn:
- Play a card, discard 1+ cards from hand, OR take an influence cube from reserve.
... The cards allow you to place or move around influence cubes on the spaces on the courtiers on the board. If the space already has a cube, you may displace it (return to supply). If you have the most cubes in a group/family, you control it: immediately take the advantage card associated with that family (these give you ongoing powers, e.g. partial immunity to power cards, ability to exchange 2 influence cube positions each turn, etc.). 
... Influence cube supply is limited to that supplied in game

- Then, may score a Petition card (from Display or your private one):
... Scoring requires that you control (= all cube spaces have cubes, and you have more than any other player; ignore neutrals) the specific courtiers shown on the card
... Place all cubes on those courtiers into supply
... Add the card (face down) to your score pile
... Replace the card 
... Flip over the top Fashion card. These mostly place neutral cubes onto the board. If the game-end card is revealed, the game ends immediately.
... Discard the face up power and influence cards and replace then with new ones

- End your turn by refilling hand to 5 cards
... may take power and/or influence cards: the face up card or from top of deck
... if you take the face up card, must return 1 cube to supply; replace the face up card immediately

At game end (6-12 turns), the player with the most VP wins.

RATING: 7
This is the first game of AEG's Tempest series which was really reminiscent of Nothing Personal for me.  In this game players take turns playing influence cards to gain influence with different characters in different parts of a Feudal-era township.

This is done in service of completing different missions which require influence with 3 different characters.  The characters are divided into different categories such as artists, military, and the royal family and majority influence in any of these categories also provides a special ability.

Like I said, this game has similarities to Nothing Personal, which I love.  This is a bit simpler though and doesn't have the variety Nothing Personal does.  I do like variable player powers though and the different influence and power cards provide a decent level of interesting decisions to make.

I do have one big problem with the game design, however.  When a mission is completed a card is turned over from a deck that acts like this game's timer.  Somewhere in the bottom 6 of this 12-card deck is a card that IMMEDIATELY ends the game.  This makes the turn order a bit of a balance issue as the first couple of players may end up with an extra turn.

RATING: 4
Interesting core idea that the majorities give you powers which you lose when you choose to score them. However too chaotic to be be able to do much more than shoot and pray at the powers and point scoring. The 'worlde' of Tempest is schlock medieval nonsense dreamt up by a 12 year old who has read his first history of the Middle Ages. It's thematic bollocks  but suitable for the by the numbers games that AEG are packaging into this theme(exception Love Letter)

One large problem the game has is the constant reset. Every round you have to reevaluate the petitions and whilst not a problem if you play  opportunistically its torture if you want to exercise control and analysis ( I don't).

So far I had only played Love Letter, but the other Tempest games are all on my list of games to try.
In this game you score points for having control of certain persons. And you get that control by putting cubes on them using cards you draw from a pile. So there is a certain luck factor. And it has quite some push and pull coming on. If that's what you like, you'll probably love this game. And I enjoyed it, but it doesn't really stand out.

Really just not very interesting. Draw a random mission, hope that no-one else needs the same one you do or you'll just be undoing each other's turns all game long.

Oh, you also need specific cards to be able to place where you want so there's another layer of randomness in the card draw. The event cards are spectacularly uninteresting with a little flavour text and 'add whites cubes to x and to y'. 

We played a shortened game with faster to achieve missions (and yet the first few rounds dragged horribly) and stacked the mission cards so that the game ended in 20-30 minutes instead of 60+. For that I'm grateful as there really didn't appear to be any more to discover or experience. Just overwhelmingly dull.

A couple of rule clarifications needed since there are a few cards that contradict the rules, but once clarified, a fun game.  Some turns are quick, and some can take more thought.  AP can exist as some more experience players may be frustrated with new players taking to long, or vice versa.  I know that last statement may not make since, but when you play the game you will get it.

RATING: 4
There is some strategy to this game, but the limit of one action per turn means you're often placing only a single cube when half a dozen or so are needed to give you the control of the courtiers you need. That plus the randomness of the cards leads you to make moves that are largely irrelevant to your strategy just to get cards out of your hand in hopes of acquiring the ones you want. When things happen quickly it's fun, but when they don't it's an exercise in boredom and frustration. Swapping the coterie cards back and forth also requires everyone to be very much on the ball about their abilities and who controls what. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 8.5
This is a medium-light game with a great feeling of momentum. It's not an engine-builder. Rather momentum is the result of an invisible hand from the players and forced progression after completing the queen's demands. Play starts slow and strategic with players placing influence to control the games major guilds or coteries for bonus powers. The game quickly advances once players fill their first objective cards, with the queen/game adding massive amounts of neutral influence to the board. The game becomes very tactical. You need to fill objectives, but each completed objective means lost influence/powers. Plus, with every completed card, neutral influence floods the board at the very end of your turn, giving beneficial game state to everyone else. This game is like riding a wave. First you struggle to catch the swell, then you struggle to stay with it as the momentum constantly threatens to buck you out. It's very fun... It's also filled with nasty interaction, so you've been warned.

This game is more straightforward than either Merchant or Dominare, which are some of my favorite games.

But its simplicity works. I love the theme, trying to buy influence. It's especially fun when an opponent thinks you are working on a different petition than you are and you blow him or her away because of a particular card or two in your hand.

This is well executed and the easiest of the Tempest board games (not the card games) to teach.

Anyone who knows the game Love Letter, knows some of the characters that appear in this game. Love Letter is the 4th game in the series of Tempest. A series that publisher AEG started in 2012, and in which all of the games share the same artwork and theme. Courtier is the 1st game in this series. As we like Love Letter very much, we were curious on other games in this series. Would this be also a game that does more with less? When opening the box, it’s very soon clear that this is an Euro-game. Cards, a game-board and cubes. After reading the rules, it seemed a bit complex to me, but after re-reading them, it suddenly all became clear to me. And when it is explained to you in a correct way, it isn’t that complex at all. Basically you can choose 1 out of

    Play a card (and resolve it)
    Take an influence marker out and place it in your personal stock
    Exchange 1 to 5 cards with the drawing piles

After fulfilling one of these actions, you may complete one petition (which will give you victory points). If you’ve done that, a fashion-card is turned over and resolved. Fill your hand up to five cards, and your turn ends. This is really all there is. Not difficult at all. The game ends, when the queen is arrested (which is a card in the fashion deck).

The game is all about area-control and manipulation. Plays very good with two, but I think this game will shine with 4 players.

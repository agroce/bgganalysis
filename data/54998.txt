Good game. It feels a little like a war game, but actually has very little battles. It is created by the same guy who made Mr Jack and similar mechanisms may be seen here (though Cyclades feels entire different). I very much enjoyed my first game and gave it a 7 as a preliminary rating.

My picky group loved this game.  The game plays in about 2 hours with 5 players.  Shorter time with fewer players I would think.  Looking forward to more plays.

Played it a 2nd time with 3 and it works real well and play time of about 75 minutes.

RATING: 10
The auction mechanic works very well, and creates a very tense initial phase, but this is married perfectly to the 'execution' section, where all the players have these dastardly overarching plans that they attempt to execute, only to find someone else interfering. Somehow, this game always manages to have a tense endgame with no clear winner. 

A slowburn, but absolutely worth it.

RATING: 5
I hated the auction mechanic.  Despite having the most money and buying power, I kept getting kicked out of the auction I wanted, and couldn't get back to it unless someone re-booted me.  because it takes so many combinations of roles to do anything you have to telegraph all of your plans.  highly disappointed with this one.

130929 Just no interest in playing this again.  Maybe its the art...just something about the soup of mechanisms that turns me off.  I don't hate it so much I wouldn't play it again, but man it would take some convincing.

110220 Fun, surprisingly simple, a bit chaotic for my tastes but I won't argue again if forced, but I certainly won't recommend it.  I'd take it over dungeon lords for sure (I like auctions > worker placement).  And after a second play, I have extremely little interest in playing it again, but I will do so if forced, though I would strenuously try to recommend something else.

A bidding mechanic that is actually quite important to get right. Getting it wrong means NOT being able to do what you need to do when you need to do it. Getting it right means you stand a great chance to win. This will certainly garner more table time in the future. "RELEASE THE KRAKEN!"

RATING: 7.5
Juego dinámico y trepidante, con componentes e ilustraciones de gran calidad, lo que ayuda a la sensación temática de la Grecia mitológica aun siendo un eurogame de libro. Tiene como virtud, o defecto, que es muy difícil quedarse descolgado durante el juego, y casi todos los jugadores tienen posibilidades de ganar en los últimos compases de la partida, logrando que la tensión e interés se mantengan altos para los implicados. Por contra, una gran estrategia y un desarrollo eficiente de los sucesivos ciclos, no te asegura la victoria.
Definitivamente, un eurogame familiar, con una rejugabilidad que se intuye muy alta, con componente temático suficiente y para cualquier tipo de jugador.

Great, great game. Can be off-putting to some people because it looks like a dudes-on-a-map wargame, but it isn't, not really. It's much simpler than it looks, as which God you win the favor of in the bidding phase STRONGLY limits what you can do in the action phase. Lots of different routes to victory, some nice catch-up mechanics, and really stunning graphical design overall.

You can tell alot of care went into the game, from putting art where it'll never even be seen during the game, to using unique minatures for the forces of each player.

1 play / 5 players

LIKE: This game has a good action / auction mechanism. It tells what others are up to and it can help conceal what others are up to. The monsters are also fun to play.

DISLIKE: Wargame tension is not really my thing, but it is on the same level as Antike here, where actions are short and multiple paths to victory reduce the actual amount of attacks that happen. The dice add a big swing element. I felt ships were rather weak towards the game end.

OVERALL: It's ok and I didn't mind playing it. Reminds me of Antike, Mare Nostrum, and others, but I like this one a little more because there are quite a few combos to look for and plays quickly.

Un mini "wargame-euro" en las Islas griegas, apoyado por una mecánica de apuestas por un dios u otro, donde el elegido dá unas acciones concretas.  Ver si aporta cosas nuevas expansiónes, pero son caras. 
Es un euro de nivel medio, casi familiar, y los componentes y el acabado del juego es precioso. Pero el juego en sí puede quedar un poco soso para algunos, que se esperen más combate u otros elementos, ya que el juego se centra más en las apuestas a los dioses y en las criaturas mitológicas.
No me gusta NADA el tema de las cartas de filósofos... al menos en lo poco que he jugado alguien ha conseguido los 8 = 2 metropolis y ha ganado fácilmente sin que de tiempo de reaccionar y te quedas con la sensación de que el resto del juego sobra y que está eso demasiado desproporcionado... para terminar pronto el juego y que no se alargue. Habría que revisar eso y arreglarlo de alguna forma haciendo que valieran más la obtención de los mismos, o pudiendo ir en contra de ellos de algún modo.

Muchos usuarios comentan jugarlo con objetivo de 3 metrópolis en lugar de 2. Que se alargaría el juego, pero que se disfrutaría más y quedaría más balanceado, con más opciones y mejor sabor.

Hay que comentar que las reglas son demasiado escuetas, y faltan muchas cosas por concretar... y es imprescindible recurrir a unas FAQs en inglés, resumen de dudas aquí en el foro BGG, que han resuelto muchas dudas que salen cuando lo juegas.

One of the best medium-weight strategy game (I wouldn't say civ game ...). It has GORGEOUS components. One of the main mechanics is the auction, but although I normally do not like plain vanilla auctions, the way it's implemented here is very nice and I like it a lot. Very well designed game and with great replayability. Some may argue that during combat, the dice roll plays a big role and although it can be somehow influenced or mitigated through various bonuses, sometimes indeed it feels like it all comes down to the die roll.

RATING: 6
It's decent.  The theme does come through and I like the edgy bidding.  However, it can bog down with astute players - so everyone is watching who might be able to win on this turn and then combining to stop them.  At the end, someone is going to get through that, but beofre they do, the game may go on an extra hour.
I've heard it's much better with the expansion, so we'll see.

This game was rather entertaining to me, I enjoyed it. The one flaw it had that caused me to trade it away was what I call the "Girlfriend" factor - she didn't like it. The mechanics were entertaining, but being my SO she really didn't like the idea of trying to kill me. I would recommend this game for competitive players who want a taste of it all - a little euro with their bidding and warfare.

Solid bidding game. Definitly recommended playing with Hades. This game seems to be a wargame, but it isnt.

This is my son's game. 

very fun game. not a game I would want to play every weekend but still enjoyable. though you can play with smaller numbers I think this game really shines with 4 or more players, I wouldn't really go less then 3 unless you are really in the mood for it. this game has a good mixture of "dudes on a map", eurogamer resource management and bidding mechanics. so it has a little something for everyone. I suck at painting yet it was enjoyable to paint the titan pieces and makes the game really shine when playing. I recommend this if your not a heavy war gamer but still like to play games like Risk or Axis and allies. Not the heaviest of games but still has good variety overall.

RATING: 8.91
Quick and easy euro-style war game with a fun auction mechanic. 
The rules a very short for such a war game due to the race for building first two metropolis which can be quite tense. I am not a big fan of the dice used for fighting.
The game has a slow pace, especially at the beginning, due to the limited movement opportunities. 
That's why I like Kemet more. Moreover, it can be nearly impossible to catch up for a losing player (having the most Priests cards is very powerful). 
Kings-making can also happen in this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Cyclades is an incredible game! Simple enough to be explained but there is a ton of game in it. I wouldn't describe this game as strategical, because it's more about tacticts and adapting your moves to the new situations that come on the board every turn. I really like the auction mechanic: it may be strange for a war game, but it works perfectly and is also very deep. It's not just managing money, because it's also important to dissimulate your intention and read those of your opponents to come back on the God you want in the right moment. The components are amazing. The graphics are stunning, especially the board, and the plastic figurines for the mythological creatures and different ones for each color's army make this game simply wonderful.

The base game has some issues still: it's too static, often the winning depends on Pegasus and the game can also drag too much, if the players don't start building. Fortunately the expansions fixed these problems while also adding so much more meat. With all the modules together this game becomes an incredible light civilization/war game, that also provides a great thematic experience.

The only reason for me not to give a 10 to Cyclades with the expansions is, that the enjoyment you can get from the game still really depends on the group you're playing with. I think some people don't enjoy the game so much, because they see a war game and they start making strategies, while Cyclades requires you to adapt constantly to new situations, that can otherwise really mess up with your plans. This leaves some players with the feeling that the game is unbalanced and sometimes they complain (at least in my experience) during the game, making my enjoyment go down a little bit. Nevertheless this game can offer a really fun experience.

Rating without the expansions: 7

A nice and light civilization and area control game. You have to bid for the favour of the Greek gods in order to be able to build armies, ships, buildings or to gain gold. Then you try to conquer as many island as possible with different building because if you manage to control five different buildings you will be able to build a metropolis. Two metropolises get you absolute victory. There is a basic, luck based (dice) combat, and also you can recruit mythological creatures to aid you. It has a great design, easy to learn mechanics and it plays out quickly. The downside is that without the reference sheet it is hard to figure out which creature what power it has.

Great game, and the expansions add a lot of variety.  Unfortunately, some of the expansions make the game worse, IMO, but because it's all modular, there's lots of opportunity to mix and match.  If this is the game you're going to play, be sure to print out a good player aid or be prepared to spend more time than you expect looking up cards and magic items.  The auction in this is excellent though.  I always like the "go to another spot if you get outbid" style auctions in this and Amun Re.  Typically great Matagot productions as well.

A very good-looking and thematic game. Mechanically well-thought of, with a great balance between betting and fighting, despite progressing quite slowly. The miniatures are awesome! You have a lot of options, but all opions seem to get you at the same place. I've never thought I would say this, but the game is too balanced in a sense: every option boils down to the (more or less) same result.
To contradict myself completely, the Pegasus card ruins the game, because it is WAY overpowered.
So that leaves us with an excellent game, which is too balanced overall, and then one lucky card draw (Pegasus)  wins you the game.

A simple light bidding cum semi-civ like game. Not a typical wargame, but sufficient battles to place it besides light-wargames category.

The cards and tiles powers are the main component that drives the game along (not a CDG though).

With the tight map, confrontations are near immediate. The amount of Icons are enought to slow the game down to rules page flipping and reading. This is perhaps the only bad point about it. 

Miniatures are fantastic.

A good light wargame-filler!

Cyclades is a mix of mechanics that I personally find enjoyable for a game of this type and bunch of specific issues that I really do not like at all. 

It's one of the most weirdly balanced games I've played. From the very first round of the game you are always a hair's breadth away from being completely screwed over and knocked out of the running at the whim of almost any player and the dice. The only thing holding back a pure blood blath is the fact that your attacker may accidentally screw themselves over by the self-same luck of the dice. Okay, so it's Risk. But I don't like Risk very much.

It is better than Risk. There are ways to more tactically and strategically build up defenses and/or attack strength. And interestingly, the only way to take any action of any kind is to win the appropriate auction for that action at the start of each round. So now it's an auction game with really, really difficult decisions.

The win condition is also interesting enough (build 2 super buildings) and there is an extra cool twist of recruiting mythological creatures every round if you have the cash for it. Essentially, you buy a one time special action. 

But then things get really crazy. Some of the mythological creatures are really just plain broken (either overall, or just crazy powerful if they come out in the right situations). That is, if the right special action comes out at the wrong moment for you (pure luck), you could easily be decimated by your opponents even if you were in a previously strong position! It's like throwing in an extra layer of just pure random over the strategy of the game. I'm not particularly a fan of that maneuver even though I actually do find the abilities and idea of the mythological creatures appealing in general.

So in the end Cyclades has cool mechanics and stunning production values with its board/bits. However, I don't particularly appreciate the tension that I or anyone can get nuked out of the game with hardly a moment's notice at the whim of the cards or way too Risk-like opening. Still, it's an interesting game that has a fun core and a cool theme. For now, I'll call it decent. Further play could shift that opinion, but I don't know if I'll ever really like just how fragile the game feels and how anti-climactic the end can suddenly be.

Never got this out with the a decent group. There are plenty of mechanisms here, but nothing that I consider really well realized. The auction (in the style of Amun Re, I understand) wasn't all that tense, the conflict is pretty uninteresting, the monsters are unbalanced, I feel there could be a substantial runaway leader / bash the leader dynamic (which I tend to dislike). Of this sort, I feel like I could handle Small World better (and I'm no Small World fan).

RATING: 6
Cyclades is an unusual mix of euro-ish auctions and development with simple conflict mechanics and take-thatery (through the monster cards).  In this, it reminds me somewhat of Bruno Cathala's earlier design (with Serge Laget) Senji.  While Senji strikes me as the more original design, I think that Cyclades is the better game. 

The development aspect means that the game does progress inexorably towards an end, rather than bog down in interminable leader bashing.  Though bashing there must be if a runaway leader is to be avoided. Income is of central importance; without it you will lose bids for the actions you need to win.  The Pegasus card seems overpowered; if it appears in the end game it can determine the result. Overall, I found Cyclades quite engaging to play, though perhaps lacking the depth to keep it returning to the table.  

The artwork and production are up to Matagot's usual high standards. The monsters are particularly well done.

After one 3p play, it seems a very good multi-player wargame. Much of the contest is over the auctions. The scarcity of move actions means long-term planning is a must in positioning, but it's also very tactical. Seems not to suffer from the usual problems of 3p war-games, balances well, and is good fun. Would be interested to see the expansions and also to play with more.

The artwork, miniatures and overall production are both beautiful and amazing.  The only downside is that the minis are flimsy and many were broken.

A game that could have been my dream game were it not broken. I love the idea of petitioning greek gods for aid, but the cards were too powerful, and though I forget what the two cards are, they can end the game with an instant win for the player who thinks ahead. Very well might never play it again.

RATING: 5
A very balanced, elegant game.  Well designed.  It had too much back and forth area control for my taste.  Enjoyed the auction mechanic--perhaps would have enjoyed it more if the game were just the auction with some other mechanic than area control.  Played twice, then traded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
One of my favorite games of all time! And I dont even have the expansion which apparently makes it better. Combining and auction game bid for the power of the Gods with an area control game and an objective of acquiring two metropolis' either through building your own or stealing your neighbors. The only negative is the game can have an abrupt ending. Also it looks gorgeous on the table. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game where the components and the bidding are the stars of the show.  This game suffers from the fact that the last few turns feel very much like an unstoppable boulder rolling and its not often possible to stop someone from winning or making a last big move yourself.  This takes some of the excitement and tension out just at the wrong place.  Still, it is a very fun and light game with good bidding mechanics and excellent components.

RATING: 2
This game has the worst ending I've ever seen. The end game is so important to making a game good. We don't play Monopoly and Risk because the ending is atrocious.

Cyclades ends so abruptly and often times without any possibility of mitigation. That sucks. Seriously. Though I've only played it once, my entire experience was ruined by that.

RATING: 6
While this game is assuredly a decent, well designed toyish and boyish game, I simply have no desire to play it ever again because it seems designed, when played such that all players are paying attention to the board state, to inevitably produce leader bashing that produces, far too starkly and obviously, a resulting king-making effect.  Look at that players: we produced a king-making effect!   

It additionally incorporates one of my least favorite auction mechanics which far too often forces players to bid on things, and win things, they do NOT want because they were bumped from the one thing they did want.  Yes, you can try to strategize around this result by faking bids for things you don't want, in the hopes of getting bumped into things you do want, but really, why bother because doing all this isn't fun anyhow.  Better to play something else that you do enjoy.  Not-interested-in-playing-again.

Build armies and navies, fight it out on a small map. There's a simple, well designed system of bidding for actions and special powers, but it's more or less a simple battle royale. If you like pure visceral conflict with some dice chucking, this is your cup of tea. For a more cerebral, euro-style experience with no dice, look to Kemet or Bloodrage instead.

I've had this game for a while now and can't believe how long it took me to get this to the table (mostly due to my groups hesitance towards games going over an hour and me being unsure of my handle on the rules).  Now that I've finally played it... Wow.  An amazing game whose mechanics allow for a lot of interesting options to take and contemplate upon each turn.  Gameplay is very streamlined; collect money, bid for turn order/ god powers, take your action phase, restock & repeat.  One big positive I can say for this game is that there seems to be no fat in it, in that everything in the game works together to create various subtle combos for players to explore each game (especially in terms of using the mythical creatures).  A truly great game with some declicously blended mechanics.

Also: great components, player miniatures differ from one another and the rest of the components are printed on some good quality cardboard and cut in a way to further emphasize the theme.  Box could be a bit smaller, but don't let that stop you from trying/ picking this game up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decisions are not intersting enough to make me doublethink my actions, and sometimes happens automata. Also lacks intersting enough enginebuilding, like in Kemet. I enjoyed the auction mechanic and "simple enough" single action, but stock games gives me more enjoyment in that department.

Also alot of turtling happens, but that is not neccesarily a negative to me. In summary the game falls between two chairs, trying to be simple and somewhat enginebuilding, and ends up being mediocre at both. Its being lauded as an euro, but it essentially feels like an ameritrash to me.

I don't like auction games.  This one was interesting with the back and forth white elephant style auction, which I think is better than others where you might get nothing.

RATING: 7
The 3rd showing from Matagot is not as strong as the previous - but that still lands it in excellent territory.  This outing takes the game into a more direct confrontation style of play.  Players will very likely have to confront (i.e. attack) the others to get ahead.  That said, the game shines in that the ability to do so will depend on many efforts in other areas / activities.  These other aspects derive from the other gods' powers and thus it is possible to position yourself with multiple options to obtain victory.  You won't be able to switch your strategy mid-stream though (without ensuring a loss) and that gives the game a more linear feel.

An excellent game with elegant mechanics. Players are really in one another's faces the entire time...through the God auctions, the combat, the stomping on each other with mythological creatures, and so forth.

RATING: 4
Cyclades started out as a game I'd rate a 7 or 8.  After my latest play, though, the rating has dropped dramatically.  This game can DRAG.  If a player looks like they are about to win the game, other players will cooperate to outbid him, use the mythological creatures to steal or destroy his gold/cards/figures, and usually set up another player to win.  This process continues until one player hoards so much gold that the end is inevitable or the players decide to call it quits.  

Zeus' ability to cycle through creatures over and over again is just irritating, as is the Chimera's ability to retrieve discarded cards.  That means really destructive creature cards can be used multiply times in quick succession, adding more chaos to an already chaotic game.  Planning and precise bidding matter little in the endgame, as good players will see exactly what you need to win and stop you at every turn.

It's okay.  The Titans expansion allows for more army movement, which I think was sorely needed.

A BGG-s képek alapján durvább látványvilágra számítottam, de az a kiadás, amivel én játszottam, csak néhány lapkát és fabábúkat tartalmaz, ott nem voltak műanyag szörnyetegek:) A játék maga jó!! Tetszik az istenek keverése (4 fővel játszottuk, 1 mindig kimaradt), a mitológiai lények sokszínűsége, a licit viszont erősen Amun-re beütésű, majdnem ugyanaz a mechanizmus. A különbség az, hogy itt levásárolható a licitre áldozott összeg, bármennyi is legyen az. A játék egyébként nem túl komplex. Sajnos nem nagyon csatáztunk, és a lapkalerakásoknál elkövettünk egy hibát, ezért mindenképp játszanék majd még egyszer vele.
---
Másodjára 2 főset próbáltuk ki, immár (remélem) helyesen játszva mindent. Tanulságok: egyfelől nagyon jók a mitológiai kártyák, a reménytelen helyzetekben (pl. ha nem jön fel a szükséges isten, vagy esélytelenek vagyunk a liciten) általában csak ezek segíthetnek. A másik, hogy nem szabad a döntést (harcot) a végére hagyni, mert nagyon hirtelen vége tud lenni a játéknak (1 óra kb.), figyelni kell, hogy hány kör alatt tudják a többiek befejezni.

Kieggel is kipróbáltam, így 2 és fél óra volt egy 4 fős, de nem feltétlenül a kieg. miatt, talán csak többet gondolkoztunk.

Surprised that I enjoyed it so much.  Development game with the possibility of good fights to conquer other player's developments.  Interesting auction system (similar to Amun Re's) to get the favour of gods.  Much simpler to play than may appear, a with a beautiful look.  Great enjoyment with a good touch of chaos, it will not always win the one going ahead...

I have played this game a few times now.  The first time was incredible and an interesting hybrid of Euro and Amerithrash games.  However, the second time we played, the experience was ruined by an aggressive alpha gamer who got angry when I purchased a card he wanted.  The game then turned into a "vengence is mine" type game.  This caused me to put the game away for quite some time.

I am so happy that we eventually took the game back out from the shelf as we have a great time with it the last time.  The experience with that gamer has been washed away with our last play which came down to the wire.  It is that excitement which makes the game worthwhile and one of the more memorable times we have played a game like this.  If you like Euros but always wanted something more, buy this game.  If you like Amerithrash but thought a military game needed an extra something, buy this game.

The theme is very strong in Cyclades: the great production helps a lot in giving the players a very deep and intense gaming experience.
The main mechanic is area control, obtained through a (slightly random) combat system. But there's also a quite unusual bidding system used to obtain the favor of the different gods.
The game is fast, furious and fun, and there's plenty of player interaction. I foresee some kingmaker's problems, but only some more plays will tell if that's true...

Initial Impression: The components and theme of this game are wonderful. I particularly enjoy the auctioning aspect of the game. However, the game hasn't "wowed" me as much as I had hoped.

Rather old-fashioned game with relatively short rules. Actions are clear, the goal even more. For a long time the game goes on and nothing really important happens, but at once the game rushes to its finish (once someone starts to build a metropolis).This game doesn't deserve its high rating (93 at the moment of writing), but it will certainly disappear in the crowd. And that's righteous.

Played with 3p total (2p from board game meetup) and won with 2 metropolis while the others were fighting each other. It has quite a bit of player interaction, and the cards that you can purchase are good at being able to level out the game. For example, I had at least 13 coins when one of the players purchased a card that caused me to half (rounded down) and give to him those coins. I didn't mind the auction mechanic, but the fact that I could only take 1 action per turn was annoying and felt like a really slow game. Won't buy, and if given will probably trade. I may play again, but not for some time.

I'm a big fan of Kemet so I was excited about this cousin. 

Good game. My only gripe is the game can stretch insanely long because the main method of getting points can shift from player to player each turn. Get a metropolis and have it taken. Then next turn have it take from YOU. Then next turn... and so on and so on. That's my only issue. Otherwise, it's a good combat/area control game.

Loads of fun.  Awesome components.  One of the simplest games of this type, and still plenty of strategy and lots of fun to be had.  It plays like one of those games that are too complicated so no one ever wants to play (I'm looking at you Fantasy Flight) only it's really easy and everyone wants to play.

Cyclades is a eurogame with an ancient Greece theme.  It uses an auction mechanic, has direct interaction, good production value and incorporates the theme well.  Not a bad game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Cyclades is an extremely unique game that is very popular at my gaming group.  Everybody enjoys that it has a war game feel with an auction gameplay.  This gives the game a wonderful feel since Cyclades maintains the a war game's competative and confrontational nature while having the control of play of an auction game instead.  Every time, a variety of strategies are used, and we have not found that one or two strategies work better than the rest.  We have to change our game play every time as to respond to changing strategies.  The replay on this one is very very high.  I love this game.  It is fairly quick to play, which is a very big plus for me.  Why just play one great game in an evening when you can play two great games.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
The auction is fantastic and fun, the best part of the game by far. The other mechanics fit nicely but are not as great. Cool theme, cool artwork. 
The only bad thing is that the game makes it hard to attack other players by needing quite a few turns to do so, eliminating surprise attacks.

Great 5 player game. Good 3 player game. 2 and 4 player games untested. Not having all gods available hurts the enjoyment quite a bit. Even if it makes sense mechanically, it doesn't thematically and I don't really like it.

RATING: 9
Tense, fast moving area control game with very important role selection mechanic. Very playable with 2 but I suspect will really shine with 4. Fantastic artwork and pieces - great quality package. Rules are simple and straightforward and the game plays quickly for what it is. Great medium weight game. The only mild criticism I have at this point is that it's a winner-takes-all game rather than a ranked one (using VPs) so one person will probably win by themselves and everyone else will lose, rather than coming second, third etc. Very finely balanced game though so it's unlikely you'll feel you lose due to poor game mechanics rather than good strategy. I suspect a lot of people will blame the game for not letting them take the roles they want where instead they're probably not bidding high enough during the auction phase.

Very fun area control game. Cyclades can start off slow, but I love how the tension builds up as players slowly expand their armies. Cyclades will create those epic gaming moments where players will go all-in for the potential win. It is one of the main reasons why I enjoy this game

Quick and easy game with lot's of direct player interaction. Every action you take is aimed at getting the edge in the close race to two metropolisses. The bidding for the gods and small board ensures people are in each others hair all the time. The cards add some spice to the game and can make for some nice combos which open up unexpected ways to victory. Best played with 4 or 5 players as the role selection works best with those number of players. In the end a great game if you can handle the back and forth bashing.

Cyclades production values and how it straddles between Euro and Ameritrash should be sufficient to satisfy both camps. Being a Euro gamer, I enjoy that aspect of it more, but I also find the player interaction and the table talk of trying to keeping each other in check engaging. The auction mechanic is innovative and remains fresh on subsequent plays. Cyclades doesn't overstay it's welcome; playing quickly enough to keep you satiated and hungry enough to have you come back for more. 

Bring your big boy pants though; because there's a lot of attacking and defending and feelings may get hurt.

I'm not too sure about the cycling of the gods to find the one you need. I can't place my finger on it, but there's something amiss with it. I guess I need to play the game more to confirm or dismiss my suspicions.

RATING: 8
Surprisingly "casual-friendly" yet sufficiently complex so I'm very tempted to give it a 9, however the game length can be unpredictable.

I do think it suffers from a bit of an odd end-game situation, but it does have other things in its favor:  There are interesting auctions, you have the fun of building up your position via Cornucopia markers, Priests, Buildings, etc., and the fun of direct conflict as well.

Despite the occasional king-maker situations, clever and unanticipated plays can allow a player to win.

UPDATE (down to 7 from 9).  Okay played again with wife and son, and found the euro mechanics a bit too limiting.  To actually attack someone, you need as many as 3 turns as you beef up boats, get them into position, beef up armies and then go attacking, and only when those roles are available, and only when you win the bid on those roles.  It ends up being more frustrating than fun, unfortunately.  Some monsters also seem pretty overpowered for just a few gold pieces.

UPDATE (upgraded to 9 from 8).  Just played with wife and son.  Very good game that combines theme and conflict with smart euro mechanics.

After first play--  Bits and theme are great, mechanics play well.  The game itself may be a little vanilla, though.

The marriage between the dudes-on-a-map conflict systems, the need to manage what your doing with your precious gold coins, and bidding for actions/start player/plan foiling makes this game SOOOOOO satisfying to me. 

I will play this any day of the week with any player count. I've lost literally every time I've played but man, I can't get enough.

The Titans expansions make it even better because then it really ups the possibility for wonderful plays with the increased mobility of armies...or extremely poor choices because moving a lot can be pricey. The game just feels so balanced either way.

Not bad, but not a game I would suggest to play. There is a slow build-up at first, where the players gather resources and spread on the board, but then suddenly the game can end very abruptly. I do not like that, I prefer to build-up something over time and also get the time to enjoy what I have built. I also tend to dislike games where the ending of the game is in the hand of the players, as I am awful at spotting when the other players asre close to doing this.

RATING: 10
Even though it looks like a strategic and combat-heavy game, Cyclades is neither of both: actually the most decisive battles aren’t fought by the armies on the board but by the coins on the worshipping board, to get the gods’ favour. Nonetheless Cyclades isn’t either too unbalanced towards the resources’ development: it simply offers a good blend of different playstyles, kind of a neutral ground appeasing both the strategic and the euro gamer.

I really like how the mythologic side was handled, for the game’s authors show respect both for the setting and all things classical. Moreover, the theme doesn’t feel like it was stuck on the game afterwards just because it’s trendy or looks cool: on the contrary it gives the impression that it was developed within the game, for it is well integrated into the mechanics.

Cyclades is a rounded off and well balanced game, allowing many different strategies: every game is undecided and unpredictable till the end and thus till the end every player still has good chances to win. Victory always comes unexpected.
This is the first time I rate a game with a 10.

A lavishly produced game that plays almost as well as it looks.  Not quite a dudes on a map game, but not really a Euro...this might be the ultimate hybrid.  There is conflict and special powers, and resource management and auctions. Oh my!  It's got a lot of things happening, but it all comes together to create a game unlike anything else on the market.  Simple to teach, difficult to master it's nuances...Cyclades is a modern masterpiece.

Xssassin said it best, and I quote

"10
[CK]

[CK#] Collective Kingmaking
(A game state where players influence their opponents' board position so pervasively that victory is achieved by the player who the group implicitly allows to win, rather than the player who makes the best decisions.)

Is nothing sacred? Let's examine Cyclades to see just how much of a player's options and infrastructure are freely available for his opponents' to disrupt... Physical territory and gourds can be conquered. Boats, buildings, and troops can be destroyed. Money, priests, and philosophers can be stolen. A desired deity can be usurped with no possibility for the player to over-bid. (This includes turn order because the mechanic is entwined with the role selection.)

It turns out the aforementioned elements comprise Cyclades in its entirety, meaning each of your opponents can deduce your best course of action and intentionally thwart you at every junction, if they so desire. Put another way, a player cannot win unless his opponents implicitly allow his victory to take place.

The alleged balancing factor here is self-preservation; it's not directly in anybody's best interest to shaft an opponent. Consider deliberately overbidding on a deity - you pay more than the deity is worth, your opponent gets an inferior action, your other two opponents rejoice because they just spent nothing and saw two of their opponents' positions worsen. (This process is effectively like casting Hymn to Tourach on the guy to your left in a four player game of Magic.) Of course, the action is necessitated if that opponent is on the precipice of victory, and the only recourse is shaft-the-leader. While something like El Grande ends after a set number of turns, Cyclades drags on until its specific victory condition is met, and the end-game (which can come very quickly) is reduced to shaft-the-leader(s) until nobody can, or is willing. If performed to its theoretical maximum, all players begin the turn with an equal shot at the two metropolis goal and whoever goes last, or gets lucky, or is allowed will win.

Thus, a game of Cyclades will span many turns, so infrastructure cards are crucial. Apollo exceeds Zeus if you can protect the gourded island, meaning the best course of action is literally Apollo Apollo (...) Apollo Apollo Athena Athena Zeus, with a stray Ares in there somewhere. In other words, stockpile gourds on an island protected by troops purchased from Ares until you can Athena twice for a metropolis and Zeus, flushing monsters to find Pegasus - or recur it - and sending your troops to a lightly defended metropolis. (Alternatively, Athena twice more.) Problem is, thanks to collective kingmaking the best strategy won't actually work because decent opponents will overbid Athena or steal your philosophers. The futility is the same for any strategy enacted by the perceived leader. Second place has never looked so appealing, and in all honestly probably never should."

However, my rating is a 7 if table talking is NOT allowed; a ONE if people feel it's OK to tell each other how much money they have so that they can screw the leader.

Played this game last night with 4 players.  It was a blast.  It came right down to the last turn as to who won.

I love the wargame and Euro aspect as well, a nice balance.

2009. fighting, dice/cards, area ctrl.

Larry Chong says: Lots of opportunity, planning, quick-changing strategies and counter-strategies. Cyclades is quick and dynamic, things change quickly. It takes off like a ski-shoot but many times, climatic finishes can end abruptly like driving off a cliff (when you least expect it). I rather enjoy the ride of this if you like Euro-wargames.

Vien says: This is as much a social game as it is a strategic game. The winning condition can creep up on you, so everyone needs to be aware of what's going on. A cunning player though can divert attention and sneak in the win. That aspect me leaves me torn about this game.

Adam O'Brien says: I hated the auction mechanic. Despite having the most money and buying power, I kept getting kicked out of the auction I wanted, and couldn't get back to it unless someone re-booted me. because it takes so many combinations of roles to do anything you have to telegraph all of your plans. highly disappointed with this one.

I was late to this game and I wish I hadn't waited. This has been an enormous hit with my game group. It is not a hybrid just for the sake of being innovative, the Euro and thematic elements work perfectly together, producing a satisfying tension throughout. It seems that it would be hard to play this game and not indulge in some engaging diplomacy, too, as the bidding is such a crucial element. The game is deep, with many interesting decisions popping up, often different kinds of decisions in different games. The game is simple to learn, the components are beautiful to look at and the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Cyclades will have its proper place next to Chaos in the Old for top shelf hybrid games though Cyclades is much more accessible mechanically and thematically.

I have heard some complain of the "smack the leader" trope being too dominant in this game. There's only one thing worse than this, of course, and that is having no opportunity to interact to get in the way of a player pulling ahead of everyone. This second problem thankfully is not an issue with Cyclades.

Those seeking to expand the game's thematic options, increase direct conflict and mod the game in varied ways will absolutely want to check out the excellent Hades expansion.

Update: The Titans expansion (not desirably compatible with Hades) fires the Hades expansion. Titans is the expansion Hades should have been. I was actually planning on moving Cyclades down to an eight for me but Titans wakes it back up to a full nine.

It requires thinking from all sides. But on the other hand if everyone thinks too much it won't end. Each round that one could end it, the others would cooperate into "hitting" him. It has some good ideas, but 1 island+Apollo strategy might brake it...

RATING: 7
I do enjoy this game, but after trying the two-player variant I feel that it's a bit fragile.  The second game I was very aggressive right out of the gate and my opponent never really recovered from my initial assault that took away one of his two islands.  Sure, he was able to grab a cornucopia each round and 4gp from Apollo, but it did not really offset the income I was able to take by moving freely around the board.  He was faced with trying to get off his single island which would reduce his income for a turn or three and put his main island at risk to my massing forces to or try and stop the bleeding instead of making progress.  In the end, it was not enough.  I do believe that the game will be better with more players, and look forward to trying it with 3,4 and 5 people.

Cautiously rating this an 8, it could go up or down.

A perfect combination of easy-to-grasp rules, beautiful theme, tense gameplay with great opportunities for deviousness and cruel ruination of your opponents plans.

Simple to play. It appeals to my euro game friends and the wargamer in me. A perfect hybrid game of two different design thoughts.

Provisional rating - and I'm sure the game really really depends on the players, with the right group it'll be great.

My inital feeling is there is a huge amount of kingmaking, or hold back and swoop to win ... but you can't afford to accumulate cash as the Griffon can just steal half.

Need to play it more, rating may rise or fall!

** Update, played a bit more and the 'hang back behind the pacemaker and then dash for the win' element is a bit too strong here. Sure in any multiplayer wargame sticking your neck out is asking for a gang-up response, but here it really feels a 3rd player has to decide who to stop ... and the one who isn't then wins.

Still like it, but it's not the ultimate civilization game I was looking for.

Didn't care for this as much as I thought I would.  Too Euro, not enough Ameritrash.  The idea that I can't move my troops around every turn really irks me.  Not only that, but you have to move naval and ground forces on seperate turns.  Really?!

Surprised at how little I liked it.  Mechanically, it sounds really appealing, a combination of Euro-style auction mechanics with American-style flash and conflict.  In practice, the two really don't work together.  Less like peanut butter and chocolate, and more like peanut butter and olives (which might be your thing.  Who am I to judge?)

I think I'd like to try it again though.

This game should be great.  It has a great theme, great bits and interesting rule concepts.  Unfortunately the auction/role mechanic that drives the game is just too restrictive.  Want to conduct a naval campaign?  You can't because you didn't win Poseidon.  Same with a land based operation if you didn't win Ares.  Too often I feel frustrated that the game systems fight against me.  I'd rather go play something else like Chaos in the Old World than this again.

Es un juego de civilización en el que comienzas con presencia en un par de islas y tu objetivo es conseguir dos metropolis, que puedes obtener de varias maneras (construyendo, "comprandolas" o arrebatándoselas a otro jugador). En cada turno el jugador debe encomendarse a los dioses.. según el dios escogido podrá realizar unas acciones u otras. La elección del Dios se realiza por subastas... también hay unas cartas de "criaturas mitolócias" que se pueden comprar y añaden un factor estratégico al juego.

Es sencillo de jugar y los turnos son muy rápidos, pero aunque no hay muchas cosas que hacer (se usan pocas fichas durante el juego), hay mucha estrategia en cada decisión.. y tienes que tener en cuenta qué pueden hacer tus oponentes a la vez que te centras en tu propio objetivo. 

Es entretenido. Lo probé a cuatro, pero probablemente el juego se muestre en todo su esplendor jugado a cinco jugadores (así no hay ningun dios oculto y todas las acciones posibles están disponibles para la subasta).

Looked forward to playing this fairly straightforward area control game with nice theme and bits. Finished with a bit of disappointment that mythical creature cards seemed to unbalance play too much. Tentative assessment and rating. UPDATE: This has become an instant hit with my high school and college age boys. The lighter game play with the theme is similar to Small World in its appeal as a fun strategy game. I still feel the creature cards are a bit chaotic, but that lends to the appeal for them, as well as being thematic. The ability to choose actions in any order promotes a flexible, tactical flavor to the game. However, cannot rate this higher due to the overpowering Pegasus card (instant victory), which factored decisively in our games. It is also too easy to access by either appearing on the board and being purchased cheaply, or being fished out by the Chimera card from the discard pile for a cheap victory. UPDATE: Take out the Pegasus card, or create a house rule (either: only 1 unit can be "flown" or moved with Pegasus, like the Harpy, or it can only be used on a deserted island). Otherwise, game seems to be broken. An 8 with the house rule.

This game gets high praises around here, but to me it was nothing short of ordinary. Firstly, game choices struck me as evident, lacking the tension I love when playing boardgames. Secondly, the whole game felt like the ultimate turtling exercise: everyone's waiting for another player's mistake to make something happen.

A solid game experience, lots of depth and lots of excitement.  It always comes down to the wire, with other players within a fraction of winning when the game finally finishes.  Tons of turn overs and back swings as the game nears completion and everyone struggles, kicks, bites and claws their way to the top of the victory heap composed of the bodies of their former friends.  

A great time is had by all :)

RATING: 5
A decent game with an Amun Re style auction for action powers. With some tactical area control and light weuro fighting. Throw in some mythical creature powers, buildings, set collecting.

Nothing new or innovative here. It comes together well enough.

Based on our one game, it dragged on for 3 hours which was an hour longer than it needed to be for it to be fun.

If you get smashed early in the game, there is no mechanism to catch up. You will likely wallow at the bottom.

Will need replay to reassess.

Update: our second game took only 90 minutes. Much better playtime.

Update #2 from Nov 2009 to Aug 2012: increase rating from 7 to 7.5. It got better the 3rd play. The economics still seem to screw me over. But rewarding for what it is.

Update Feb 2014. Drop from 7.5 to 5. It is always Zeus that wins. Whoever gets the most priest cards gets whichever god they want and wins. And Pegasus is usually involved. Seems broken.

Very interesting game with some great surprises. Turn order can be a game changer, making the game much subtler than you might think at first. On our first play I had a strong lead, and on the very last round I built my third metropolis (which should have won me the game). But since we still had to finish the round, my opponent attacked me with Ares, stole my newly-finished metropolis, and used Athena to acquire a fourth philosopher, thus stealing the win from me in two short moves! An exciting ending to what I thought was a done deal. I will play my hand differently next time...

Fantastic. This has some euro and some ameritrash. It has a ton of strategic and tactical decisions. All around fabulous game.

05/12/2011 - Upgraded rating from 9 to 10. The more I play this game, the more it impresses me.

10/14/2011 - Downgrading from 10 to 9. The game is fantastic, but it's not seeing as much table time anymore. Perhaps the expansion will bump it back up. Regardless, this game has cemented itself as one of my Hall of Fame favorites.

After a few plays, I have to say this game is pretty damn good.  It isn't without it flaws but I want to make a few notes about it.  The core box works well to introduce the game to the mechanics.  But, it suffers from its slow progression and movement.  Some may like this, I find it too limiting.  That said, Kronos fixes all of my issues with the game.  The rest of the expansions are icing on the cake.  The expansions are highly modular.  You can pick and choose and introduce mechanics slowly over the course of several plays.  I recommend you teach the game with the core box.  By your second play, you should add Kronos and the heroes.  Then you can add in the artifacts.  To me, the Titans expansion is a must own.

It seems hard to come back if you get beat down, unless you have a stockpile of cash at that exact moment.  Getting more money is hard since it's based on your territories, so other players who now have more money can outbid you for pretty much the rest of the game.

RATING: 6
I thought this was clever in a lot of ways, and it seems like a game I should like more than I did. But there is some serious broken-ness with the mythic creatures cards in the endgame, with a discard-retrieval card and Zeus' ability to endlessly cycle until he finds a card he needs being particularly problematic. Like so many Asmodeé games I've played, it's frustrating close to being quite good, but has a crippling flaw.

Others have commented on the pacing issues, and I think that's a legitimate gripe. It takes a long time to get anything going in this game, as you can do only one thing per turn and doing anything meaningful requires stringing together 3 or 4 different actions, with intermediate results not being that rewarding. The Mythical Creatures might provide an interesting outlet for mitigating this somewhat, but as I say they've got some issues.

Anyway, it's not a bad game, but this is a genre of games (king-of-the-hill wargames) in which it is notoriously difficult to do anything good, and I'm still sticking with Star Wars Risk or Conquest of Paradise I think. Those games give me more turn-to-turn satisfaction and sense of drama.

very nice, good game to play with your friends. with the expantions of the game is much more better to play. the only negative is that some rules are not quite clear, for example how the Kraken creature move in water, who has the control of the monster for how many turns. The miniatures of some monsters are not painted, but i start painting them. Have fun with this nice game. The greek players of the game we wait to have region and national tournament.

Near perfect synthesis of Ameritrash and Euro.  Very conflict oriented but not stifling.  The integration of the bidding mechanic with the area control/victory point portion of the game is flawless and highly engaging.  

I do find the 2 and 3 player games a bit weak and less interesting due to how the gods are positioned.  If you can gather 4-5 people, this game is phenomenal.

Top 5 game, and still there despite having Kemet. 

Love the 'acceleration' that occurs throughout the game, whereby the bids for gods mount up and the end of the game seems to loom in from 2 turns away, but doesn't necessarily happen as expected! The end conditions ensure a shortish play time.

7 is based on one play with 2 players.  Slow to get going but once it does there is lots of conflict as people fight for different isles.  Looking to see what it's like with more players.

After a 2nd play, this time with 5 players, I don't care much for the game with the runaway Zeus effect.  It could be the people I was playing with so I want to give it one more go before getting rid of it.

Definitely better the 3rd time but still very "meh"ish

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Our first and only game came down to kingmaking, making it all feel incredibly anticlimactic. Not sure how common this is or if it was because we were all just n00bs. A pretty big bummer for a first game though.

The auction mechanic is cool and effective. You win and lose by your plays here. ALL of the fun and tension in the game came from trying to bid JUST enough to deter other people from ousting you. Loved it!

The only real problem I had with the game is that, like many other games in the Euro-Risk genre, it's better to just play defensively than attack anyone like... ever. You make yourself far too vulnerable if you strike first, so combat ends up feeling useless and boring. If combat had been a bigger part of the game my rating would be a LOT higher.

Art and theme are obviously rad. EXCEPT SIRENS IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY WERE BIRD WOMEN (YES, DISTINCT FROM HARPIES) NOT MERMAIDS. GAWD.

Only played with two players so far and waiting to rate until played with 5 players. I think this game will be best played with 5 players. 

Played it with 4 players and it is so far my favorite game. Very little luck involved and a lot of strategic choices from the start of the game. It can be a bit too much for new players and it take a couple of games to truly appreciate it, but when you do it's wonderful. The best part is that the games finishes when someone has reached its goal and does not suddenly stops and everyone counts their points. This adds a lot of excitement to the game and it can be really tense. 

The artwork of this game is truly exceptional and the figurines are super detailed with each color having different soldiers and boats. For such a complex game it's not too long clocking in at 2 hours playing time which is just right. 

The game is really balanced so it's the better player that will win. If you like chess but would like a theme I would recommend this game. 

The only negative I can say about this game is that it's a bit complex to introduce to new players especially if they're not used to a bit more advanced board games and the price. But when you open the box you will understand why you pay a bit more for this game.

(MASTERPIECE #7 of 10) Sooooo good a game which gets better with each play. An incredible blend of tactics and strategy. The game can reward aggressive, hostile play against your opponents but it really is a timing thing tantamount to the risk/reward aspect of a tactical approach leaving a well thought out sacrifice (akin to chess). It is not the knife fight in a phone booth offered by Kemet (which I think Cyclades is far superior to) but there is a sneaking around and surprising your opponent aspect. Really enjoy the long term planning and trying to out guess your opponent. The game really comes down to selecting the right god at the right time. Really a fantastic fighting area control game  made better by most the expansions.

Cyclades mixes elements of euro games and ameritrash games, and even though I'm not a fan of the latter, I think this game is quite good - it's not a favorite of mine, but it's a very different game than so many others. In my first game (4p with my gf, her father and my brother), the 3 guys made a lot of offerings to the war gods while my gf slowly got the favor of the philosophers etc and actually managed to get her 2 metropolises quite fast even though we tried to deny them to her. So I guess the game is a bit more of a euro game, but it's still refreshing to play a game like this from time to time.

Still, I think there are some issues with the game. It takes a while to play, and the core mechanic is basically the auction for the gods (which, admittedly, can be quite intriguing, especially when you get outbid and make a low bid on another god because you hope to get outbid on this god too so you can go back to the first god)! 
I'm not a huge fan of how the combat system works. I think building up your forces and attacking takes too long. On the one hand, this is good as your opponents can plan how to defend themselves and perhaps win the next bid on Ares so you cannot move your troops. On the other hand I think it makes the game less fun as there aren't that much combat in a game as a player needs at least two turns to recruit and move armies through his ships. This means the game becomes about planning sequences of moves across several rounds while at the same time managing your economy so you can win the necessary bids to carry out your attacks. 

The game isn't all about attacks, actually on the contrary; it IS a eurogame with a main mechanic centered about auctions. You can even win by not attacking at all (I've seen it happen, though it rarely does).

The mythological creatures add a nice variety to the game, though the symbols can be quite hard to understand, so you'll constantly need to look them up in the rule book. This is a small minus in my book, though it can be mitigated with repeated plays. I especially like Pegasus as it can be used to make a surprise attack - I actally won a game once by using it on a guy who had built his second Metropolis that round and thought he had won, but I captured it and won instead, which was quite an epic ending.

However, normally the ending is a bit anticlimatic to me because suddenly someone has won because they often just builds the last building they need for their metropolis (or just bought Pegasus and swooped in and claimed a metropolis!), and nobody can react or do anything about it. It's not the game's fault, I just prefer games where you tally up your points in the end. As this is one of the few games without VPs, obviously you cannot do that.

Oh, and last thing: having played with the expansion, Hades, I must say that I will suggest to include that expansion most of the times - it just adds so many cool features and makes it a more brutal game with much more interaction and interesting decisions (however, the Hades module also seems a bit clunky).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice board and plastic minis. It seems fairly chaotic due to the super-powerful cards. Players tend to gang up on emerging leaders (all information is open apart from gold) so the lead changed frequently. This collective kingmaking continues until someone is in a position to buy the Pegusus card and then they win.

interesting bidding system, but doesn't work at all with three players - awfull game with this player count.
With two it is much better, but this is one of those games where all players prepare to execute that one power move/turn/round, where they get from last place to instawin - compare TI3 or AGoT. i.e. winning is not really about how good you play, but about how attentive your opponents are. I don't like that in games very much.

Εξαιρετικό παιχνίδι στρατηγικής με επίκεντρο τα ελληνικά νησιά και το ελληνικό δωδεκάθεο. Οι παίκτες προσπαθούν να δώσουν τη μεγαλυτέρη προσφορά σε 1 από τους 5 διαθέσιμους θεούς που επιθυμούν (Δίας, Αθηνά, Ποσειδώνας, Άρης, Απόλλωνας), ώστε να κερδίσουν την εύνοιά του και να εκμεταλλευτούν τις δυνατότητες που τους παρέχει. 
Σκοπός του παιχνιδιού είναι η κατοχή από έναν παίκτη 2 μητροπόλεων στο τέλος κάποιου γύρου (αυτός είναι και ο νικητής της παρτίδας).Η νίκη μπορεί να έλθει είτε με κατάκτηση μίας μητρόπολης άλλου παίκτη, είτε με κατασκευή μίας νέας μητρόπολης από τα 4 μικρότερα κτίρια (φρούριο, λιμάνι, ναός, πανεπιστήμιο). Σε αυτό μπορούν να σε βοηθήσουν οι θεοί, οι οποίοι μπορούν να σου προσφέρουν (πάντα με το ..αζημίωτο, δλδ χρυσά νομίσματα) μυθικά τέρατα, ιερείς, φιλοσόφους, στρατό, στόλο, δείκτες πλούτου. 
Γενικά, για ότι κάνεις χρειάζεσαι την εύνοια των κατάλληλων σε κάθε περίπτωση θεών, οι οποίοι φαίνεται να είναι μόνιμα ..διψασμένοι για χρυσό :):):):)

I've only played this a couple of times, and while I enjoyed myself I felt like the gameplay was a little too random for me. The creature cards could vastly alter the events of the game which penalizes careful planning and replaces it with the luck of the draw. The play is fun and the theme is engaging - however I don't find it unique enough to find regular play at my table.

RATING: 8
Fast paced war game with simple fight mechanics and an Amun-Re auction that feels mostly like a puzzle.  There is the problem of bashing on people and taking them out of contention, but there is a player elimination rule that prevents losing all chance of coming back.  Only one person a round getting each action of a) move boats (bridges) b) attack c) get a point - can make for some really interesting auctions and ensures sneak attacks are at least 2 turns away.  Enjoyable and would like to play again.

Rated 8 after one play. Well, first play, and I personally really enjoyed it, but overall our group of four probably had a more overall sobered reaction. Pluses were the theme and the sense that there was multiple paths to victory. But, for some, I think it was "I need to play this again to have a strong opinion."

Personally, I'm a bit more optimistic. You can't avoid conflict, but that's fine with me. You also can't bum rush someone out of nowhere. Most combat is foreshadowed. There's one exception though--the mythological creatures can cause some real surprises. I'm not sure if this diminishes with familiarity.

Amun-Re with armies is a pretty apt description. So far, I like it. Time will tell if others agree with me.

Update: Another play left me with slightly dampened reactions. I had the right crowd for this game, but somehow it fell flat. As much as I like the thought of a game that determines a winner in some way other than ubiquitous "victory points," the two-metropolis win condition seems both abrupt and without drama. We had only two conflicts in the game, and it was surprising to see such little interaction. This is turning into a candidate for trade bait.

Update: ...and that's what happened. Eventually traded this away for Ora et Labora.

Esse é outro genial. A temática de mitologia grega me agrada muito, e esse jogo sem dúvidas é o melhor do gênero que eu conheço. No jogo você pode invocar 5 diferentes deuses (Zeus, Ares, Athenas, Poseidon e Apollo) através de leilões bem interessantes e ainda pode comprar a ajuda de criaturas mitológicas consagradas como Medusa, Kraken, Minotauro, Centauro e muitas outras, cada uma com um poder específico bastante interessante que irão te ajudar a destruir os oponentes e a construir Templos, Docas, Universidades e Fortalezas para então transformá-las em metrópoles.
Componentes maravilhosos, arte gráfica perfeita. Jogaço!

Got this for Christmas 2010, but haven't played it yet.  Looks very interesting.  Looking forward to playing it.

[b]Update[/b]: Played a friend's copy, and I really wasn't enamored.  Game seemed way too random for my taste, and I don't usually mind a bit of randomness.  The one thing I hated in particular is when the outcome of a turn is basically that you accomplished nothing.  This can happen when you "settle" for Apollo during the bidding on gods, getting a cornucopia.  And then another player who got something better plays a card to take a cornucopia from you.  Hooray -- I just did [b]nothing[/b] this turn.  And it's not sour grapes speaking, because I actually won this game.  I'm willing to give it another go, but not a good first experience.

1 play... about 90% euro machine, 10% simple wargame. Maybe in a game class like Small World, though not otherwise similar. Remarkably smooth and easy game procession.

Cyclades was one of my first "big box" games with a ton of components. It's an interesting mix of building up armies, capturing territory, maneuvering across the small islands, getting into bidding wars, and so on. The individual mechanics fit together very well, and victories are not always certain. It always seems like everyone is one step away from winning near the end of the game. And unlike many other wargames, it's difficult to turtle up and bide time: everyone is immediately a target because of how close you start to each other, and how temping the islands and prosperity spaces are to capture.

It also needs to be mentioned that this is an absolutely gorgeous game. From the box art, to the player screens, to the cards - it's all very visually appealing.

I'm getting close to wanting to pick up the Titans expansion. Co-op in particular sounds really fun.

RATING: 7.5
One of the nicest productions of a dudes on a map game I've ever played. It's got a more measured pace then most of this genre with only a few troops and an auction at the start of each turn to determine which actions you're allowed to take. It's really beautiful on the table and has a nice refined feel to the rules and flow. I have heard it is a lot better with the Giants expansion but i haven't tried that yet. Hades expansion does not add much and i would pass on that.

I play this with my 7 and 10 year old boys.  They love it!  After 10 plays we are finding different strategies. 

My 7 year old bids Apollo for the first 2 or three turns, collects gold and then buys Philosopher cards with Athena leading to a quick Metropolis.  My 10 year old waits until there are juicy targets and then pounces on them with Ares (usually my 7 year old's island with a metropolis).

At first I enjoyed the fact that the game is short but after more plays I would rather have it last a bit longer.  The game tends to end when a powerful mythical creature combo becomes available and whoever has the gold takes advantage of it for the win.

looks too complicated for me

I have played it now and I was right. I really like it but it has too much going on with too many unforseeable ways to lose what you have and too little ability to protect what you have. The catch up mechanisms in xeno farming with one planet are so powerful that when I took another players planet in the first round I actually set him up for the win. The only other time planets changed hands was when he took over two planets with imperium buildings to win.

One of those games where the best strategy is bide your time, don't do too much to make yourself a target and then try to win the game with a big move at the end.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that type of game, but I don't tend to enjoy them.

There's enough here for it to be engaging, however ... and I'd happily play again if others wanted to.  But ultimately, it's just not my cup of tea.  Very attractive game, by the way.

RATING: 5
One play at Spiel 2009, but totally botched due to a rules explanation error which seriously affected combat. I think I want to purchase the game then—despite some reports of rich-get-richer problems. I attribute these to not valuing the offending cards and chits correctly. A priest should be hideously expensive simply because he is rather powerful... In any case, the RRP is very high, and that might stay my hand for now.

[b]Update[/b] I was able to purchase a copy in the recent months (at the time of writing), and confirmed that the game is much better with the correct combat rule. At the same time I think the actual game is weak, making me regret my purchase to a significant extent. The reason is that with less than the full 5 players, one god is semi-randomly withdrawn from every round; and that combat has been split over two different gods. This means it can take quite some time before the first fights break out: fighting is costly and thus requires preparation, even if it just to make sure you get your hands on the god you need. Now the game has been balanced thus that the other two gods are dangerous in their own right, so technically that makes up for it. But it does nothing to alleviate the game's slow pace which has players shifting tactics all the time.

While annoying, what actually nags at me far more is the very partial reactive nature of Cyclades' game play. Players are not busy planning their way to victory; instead they are pushed onwards by the every growing influx of money and special cards and buildings to strike out quasi-randomly against the others, hoping that this buys them sufficient time to worm their way to victory. If I see someone gaining more money, I want to do something about that [i]right away[/i]—but no, I may not be sufficiently close, the gods may not be available, another player may consider the situation not yet sufficiently dangerous and block me for his own ends, ... and by the time I arrive at the scene another bushfire has sprung up demanding my attention elsewhere. As a result, undesired and/or unrecognised situations may persist for too long for the players to do anything about them anymore. So I make do and hope it is sufficient. Usually it isn't: In all of the games I've played to date, I've been relentlessly reduced from a competitor to a figurant doing nothing but stalling other players at the expense of my own position, and ultimately just being either out-money'd or out-war'd. If I look at the strategy guides and reviews and responses of fans to complaints, they always speak of actions as if sufficient financial resources are available. 'Purchase threatening creatures before someone else can', 'Bid up highly for Athena because of the threat of multiple philosophers', 'Use the Kraken!', that sort of thing. Yes, of course, obviously. If I could I'd definitely do so. You will also see that a good creature just [i]happened[/i] to arrive at the right moment. Yay for yourself. But what happens if you [i]don't[/i] have the resources to do the above, and that the creature stack is shitty and uninteresting? Well, then the answer is, from my experience, that you're losing the game and are really just delaying the inevitable. Cyclades doesn't really allow the players to claw back from a weak position; cooperation between weak players is hard as the game treats them as natural competitors just the same; and whoever ends up in a weak position is due to unpredictable (not necessarily random) effects to begin with. All you can do is react to other players, exploit their weak moments, and hope that you come out of the initial struggles with the best papers.

I should add that the above doesn't mean that you will always win; you will simply be a strong contender for the win as the competition has been seriously reduced in both power and number. I find myself caring less and less who eventually wins in this case, or even the game itself: my beef is with the fact that the road towards that finish is far too often unfair and game-technically uninteresting.

I keep open the option that with more experienced players matters become more exciting, but for now I'm not as enamoured with the game patterns in this game as I thought I'd be. Part is unwarranted expectations, but part is also disappointment with what [i]is[/i] in the game. I'm putting in a rather lower rating than I wanted the rate to be.

[b]Update[/b] As part of an Alphabet Challenge to play through my collection from A to Z this game was of course also on the roster. But in over a year I never managed to round up sufficient enthusiasm to play this title with 4 or 5 people. I drew my conclusions from this, and let the game go to a place where it will be looked after better.

Słyszałam wiele zachwytów nad tą grą, jednak wstrzymywałam się długo z zakupem, bo nie przepadam za bitewnymi i strategicznymi grami. W końcu po kolejnych pozytywnych recenzjach postanowiłam się przełamać i dołączyć ten klasyk do swojej kolekcji i absolutnie nie żałuję. W grze fajnie połączono elementy strategii z licytacją przychylności bogów, którzy pozwalają wykonywać określone akcje. Gra nie daje wyraźnej przewagi nikomu, dzięki różnym kartom mitologicznych stworów, które naprawdę w jednej chwili mogą diametralnie zmienić sytuację na planszy. Gra bardzo zyskuje wraz z ilością graczy. Ponadto nie jest zbyt trudna, więc dosyć szybko można nauczyć w nią grać nowych graczy, to ważne przy grach na 5 osób i więcej, bo na co dzień zazwyczaj ciężko zebrać stały skład. Niestety ubolewam nad tym, że ciężko mi zebrać 5 osób, by poczuć pełne możliwości tej gry.

This is a great game.  A mash-up of auction and area control mechanisms, this game plays in a hour or so.  It has a great theme and artwork, plus lots of bits, including unique figures for each player color, and 5 different monster figures, which are highly detailed.  We have played this game with 2, 3, and 4 players.  Because of the auction mechanic, more players = more fun.
  
Beware, multiple paths to victory mean that this game can end very abruptly if you are not paying attention.  To me, that's part of the appeal.

Lovely production quality, excellent mechanics. The use of auctions to restrict the number of actions you can take on a turn reduces playing time significantly and forces you to think carefully and plan in a way that isn't obvious.

Tight gameplay that tasks players with finding a delicate balance between offense and defense. As with most games using this auction mechanic (e.g. Evo), making players overpay for a desired effect is a strong move, as is keeping prices level to prevent players from building an economical advantage. Battles can become rather swingy when mythical creatures are involved, creating new opportunities every turn.

curses spoken. Guilty pleasures abound. If you need to feel in control all the time steer clear of this game.

RATING: 7
Interesting cross between an auction game and a wargame.  In Cyclades, players attempt to build two metropolises, which can be acquired culturally (by building the right buildings or bringing on philosophers), or by force (from other players).

To gain all these things, players need to increase their revenue, and then make offerings (bids) to the gods - Zeus, Ares, Athena, and Poseidon.  While Ares and Poseidon will build your armies up (to attack or defend), Zeus and Athena provide cultural benefits and special discounts.  Alternatively they can honor Apollo and reap smaller economic benefits.

I like that this game isn't too much in either genre to turn off the average player.  But it felt a bit dry and that you didn't have the space to really create an engine to make powerful moves - perhaps it's balanced to a fault.  Also I find that the need to "shuffle" the large god tiles is ridiculous; I ended up using an option in the Start Player app to determine the random order each round.  Overall this is a slickly produced game, but I don't think it will be a favorite for our group.  I'm curious to try the expansion.

I'm not very fond of "free-for-all conquer all" games, but I just loved Cyclades!
I had played Small World many months ago and I hated it, but this one is brilliant and much deeper yet really simple.
I think the auction is what makes this game really awesome.
Not totally in love with the victory conditions though, it could probably be improved as it makes the obvious leader an almost automatic loser in the end.
Should probably look for variants with improved victory conditions.

One of my first boardgames.

All the components are top class and they fit very well with the theme.

i like that every action weighs heavy and in spite of this it flowes very smoothly, because the basics are clear and simple.

But in the interaction-part the game excells and shines, gaining momentum out of the bidding and the mutual "hold the best one down".

The components are very good or great, the mechanics and the first game teachable in 10min!

This game was an instant must have since the first time I heard about it. I just love greek mythology and anything that has to do with the Pantheon :). The game looks great when it is spread out, components are very nice and good quality. I like the hybrid system, the combination of euro mechanics(worker placement and auction) with the ameritrash combat system.

For me this is a game that I don't see myself parting with and the people I normally play with agreed.

Components: Stunning artwork all around. The board, god, and creature art are all magical. The miniatures are super cool, especially the fact that each player's pieces are different.

Experience: Unfortunately, the theme just doesn't go with the game mechanics. Half of this game is a tight economic game, with bidding, earning income, investing in tech, and buying improvements. The other half is a war game, with in-your-face aggression that is out of my comfort zone. Neither of these really fit with the fantasy theme I was hoping for. Feels like Hellas on steroids.

With so much conquering going on, it seems pointless to even invest in my own buildings when someone else can just come take them.

The creature cards add some cool effects, but not enough to really make it fun. There is a lot of chaos.

I'd like to play again, but hopefully with more players so I can see the board and auction in all its glory, and hopefully turtle into some corner of the map.

Played 2p game at BGG.Con. Game should be much better with 3-5 players. It's a lot more fun than I thought. Combat uses only 1 die per player which increases the luck factor, but combat is quick.
Production is great and the gameplay is fast. Lots of choices and lots of cool special powers. This game is on my list now.

Exquisitely crafted euro/ameritrash hybrid. The bidding phase is simple yet tense, and the roles of the different gods, buildings and creatures are all balanced on a knife edge.

This is always a crowd pleaser in our group. often there are several people who can win the game if they get a particular god. this makes for a very cutthroat enviroment. Is very fun.. would be rated higher except for the pheonix card....

RATING: 9
Beautiful to behold, tons of fun to play.  A good mix of theme and strategy make this game high on my Wishlist.  Paint up those cool mythical beasts, and it truly is a sight to behold.  Plus, bidding for favor from the different gods is interesting and fun.

Wallenstein (take building others build) meets Puerto Reeko (decreasing choices for last players-actually player getting Apollo is dummy- they get money & no turn)) meets Las Vegas (bid over someone- they leave) meets Hera & Zeus (a shoping list of monsters are used against players).

LOVE this game.  It makes me sad that I can't get an Ameritrash group together to play these kind of games more often.  Absolutely perfect mix of dudes on a map and Euro sensibilities with auctions, jockeying for turn order, and managing money.  Plus, you get to yell "Release the Kraken!"

One of the few games with an auction element, that I actually like.
Auctions are usually pretty tense as they define what actions will be available for you in any given round.
It's one of those type of games where you just don't have enough time to do all the stuff you would like in any given round. So choose your actions carefully!

After two plays I'm totally sold. The game might not be very strategic, but it's simply amazing fun. I love the fact that it has several levels of tension - on one hand the auctions get very exciting, the combat is a dice-fest, which always increases tension and the element of cards means that you never know what might happen. So far I only played 3-player games, but I am sure it only gets better with more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A wild, swingy, and constantly entertaining game of tense auctions, dudes-on-a-map combat, and area control. Simple to learn and play but very hard to play well. Because a player can lose a metropolis or an entire army in a single combat, the current winner can never get comfortable and the current loser can never be counted out. If you're in the mood for a game that is predictable, merits long-term planning, and is low on conflict, this is not for you. Otherwise, you're going to have a blast.

The only real complaint I have is that Zeus' cycling ability leads to too much end-game digging. As a result, we always house-rule that every subsequent cycle costs one more coin than the last and that seems to solve the problem well.

Also, damn is it a gorgeous game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Not really a Euro and not really Ameritrash.  Yet it's not really a wargame either.  This original design seems fun after one play, but more are needed before really figuring out its replay value.

After being a long time favorite I sold it away. Mostly because of play length.

RATING: 8
Not enough plays for a true rating, but this game is amazing in its balance and how you must be OK with setbacks and surges from unexpected sides. The tight map, the tight strategy, the minimal luck (although combat can be lucky). The interaction between players. These elements appeal to me.

And having played it more now- yes, it's a straight up good game deserving my 8. I am hard to grant a nine which would take years of play and experience for me to award (like Blood Bowl), so maybe one day.

Hm. Makes me wonder what the hell I would award a 10 to.  Maybe Blood Bowl in a few years.

Cyclades is a brilliant eurogame that feels like an ameritrash. I love how the two sides of the coin can be combined to make something much better. This game looks great, plays great and has a real sense of progression throughout the game. The tactical choices a player has to make are numerous and not always that obvious.

RATING: 9
I really like this game. It's got a deep enough strategy element to keep me entertained but simple enough to get my non-gamer friends into it. The theme is amazingly consistent and the components are superb. The gameplay consists of auctions, area control, and a little resource management, with included creature cards that have interesting effects to spice up the game. The game has some luck involved, which I'm not too fond of in most games, but Cyclades does a great job in incorporating everything I love about board gaming that the luck keeps everything simple and intense for battles. Basically no down-time and plenty of interaction. Will keep playing and hope to play more games soon!

The components of this game give a lot to like.  Unique ships and troops are for each player are a real nice tough.  The artwork on the cards is also very good.  It is easy enough to learn and teach, so that is another plus.  My first play left me a little wanting, though.  I thought it just moved a little too slow.  Part of it might have been that we didn't push conflict enough.  I found myself spending more time with the economic battle that I did with trying to win the game.  I think it would also be more interesting with more than three players.  I can see why people would like this, but I thought it fell just a little flat.

RATING: 6
Really like the overall flow of the game and using the gods and monsters is great fun.  Unfortunately it seems like the game will always come down to a whole bunch of kingmaking.  It's almost a group exercise in how to extend the game on each player's turn, which is too bad.

Really wanted to like this one more, due to the theme, the gods and the monsters. Alas, what should be a great war game is really more about who can build the right buildings and sneak in for a win. Not quite sure why this fell flat for me other than that...loved having the kraken wandering about on the board eating ships!  I'm intrigued by some of the changes made in the Hades expansion, but I will have to try someone else's copy.

Great artwork, lovely miniatures and I really really love the theme...
Sadly, I do not like the game as much. While in theory I love the game and it's mechanics, it's so very unenjoyably swingy (ESPECIALLY since Pegasus ends the game more often than not) and it seems like a rich-get-richer game. That isn't properly mitigated by the additional cornucopias. Though I have to admit I only once played it with 5 players - I suppose it'll look quite differently then.

IT does get better with the titans expansion, but not by a significant amount.

Going into the game I thought the dudes on a map mechanic would be where most of the action is, but it's the bidding that really shines. Good blend of euro and ameritrash styles, and the conflict seems to be the right amount for my tastes. 

Just proves again why Bruno Cathala is my favorite designer.

Really want to play this one more, and then eventually with the Titans expansion.

I've played this three times now and it's one of my current favourites.  I love the fine balance of the game that means everyone has a good shot at winning.  I especially love the auction mechanism, which sees you trying to pay as little as possible for the god you want whilst trying to make your opponents pay more for theirs.  I love the chaos that the monsters bring.  It's just a fantastic game!

The bidding mechanic is awesome and involved with many players. While playing with fewer it becomes even more intense.
I like the aspect of tactical gameplay and that players get to know a bit your intentions so there is some of a defense preparation.
The only thing I do not like is how snowbally the game feels when someone gets ahead.

The 3 player game we had was good and went for a while as we didn't know the rules.

The game moved fast and was fun.

Unfortunately the game kind of felt like it really began and ended on the last 2 turns as that is when the fighting began and the end game victories were achieved.

Attacking earlier or having a different number of players could change the feel of this game a bit but would need to play more games to tell.

RATING: 5
Civ growth/conflict game where you can only move your armies or ships, etc if you've won the auction. This does create some interesting tactical options since only one player will be moving armies, or ships, etc.
OTOH, it also makes for a wierd slow motion growth where winning the right auction at the right time becomes very important.
Add in some chaotic action cards & monsters and some lumpy plastic and you've got something which smacks a bit of a 70s combat game, but has some euro auction action.
I can take it or leave it.

My favorite game. I hesitated to give it a 10 for a long time because 2p can be brutal if the players aren't evenly matched, but that's blaming the game for a fault in the players. By that logic it would be impossible for an area control/direct conflict game to reach a 10 since that's the nature of the beast. Having realized this, the game is ideal: perfect 10.

2013: On subsequent plays, it also scales very, very well.

Can be taught in minutes, endless possibilities and true freedom on your turn to do whatever you like in any order. Makes you wonder why so many games have so many rules.

Cathala avoids the pitfalls so many designers fall into: hex map instead of diagonal moves on a grid, adjusted values on d6 so battle is flavored by luck, not solely determined by it, and a simple ruleset that can be explained in minutes.

played twice with Titans expansion, one six-player game (which we erroneously played with 2 teams of 3 each). Teamplay was quite nice. The other time we played with 5, each on his own.

RATING: 8.25
The game mechanics engage the theme very well - the bidding for buying of the favour of the Gods, is derivative ('Evo', 'Amun Re') but is very well integrated and spiced up nicely by randomising the turn order. The combat system is simple but has enough nuance and variability to be exciting. There are 3 paths to securing the victory and the game keeps the finish pretty tight resulting in tense games in which everyone is usually still interested for the duration.

It has a reasonable playing time and some pretty good art and is excellent component wise.

An 8 after 2 games but likely to edge up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game of bidding with conflict that is like a knife-fight.  Players start at close quarters and the ability to initiate warfare is dangerous and risky.  There is subtle jockeying for position, but every play toward aggression is completely telegraphed.  The tight range between game start and victory conditions makes this dance even more tense as the game quickly acquires the feeling that someone could win at any moment.

Has been underwhelming for my group, but I am bullish on the design.  I feel there is a great game lurking just beyond our limited experience.

I was never fan of bidding games. Therefore when I have heard about the Cyclades - I was not excited to try it - until I did. It is a solid piece of game. Bidding element is crucial here - so either I do not mind bidding games or this is really good game ;)
Limited number of options does not give too much time for decision paralysis. Just few more options with the gods would be nice (expansion is a must! -> Hades).

RATING: 7
A game where everyone is jockeying to be the first to gain a certain amount of resources.  Towards the end, the game everyone nears the finish line and players take turns preventing others from winning.  Finally, when enough players are close the finish line, it can no longer be prevented and a couple of players cross.  Tie breaker goes to most money.  I see this game tie'ing often.  Normally I would rank a game like this a '6'.  But this one gets an extra point because of the fun mechanic of choosing deities (amen-re bidding) and the many monsters + figuring out how to best use them to get your resources (while thwarting others).  Not sure I'd want to play it that often, but fun enough.

RATING: 9
Great theme, wonderful artwork and fun to play. It is also a very easy game to teach and to remember.it is fundamentally a four-game where you are dominating the map. One interesting thing is the bidding for the gods favor. This element really broadens the experience and brings in player interaction which I love.

RATING: 7
Players try to be the first to own two metropolises in the Greek Isles.  Fun, fast playing civilization growth game, where players bid in Amun-Re style for the right to use a god this turn.  Zeus is all about priests and temples, Ares about troops and forts, Poseidon about fleets and ports, and Athena about learning and universities.  You only get to do one "thing" a turn, depending on your god, so it takes a while to get anywhere, but the turns are so blindingly fast, it doesn't appear to be a problem.  Metropolises are claimed by cashing in a set of four buildings, a set of four philosophers, or by taking it off another player via Ares.  On top of that, mythic creatures toss a bit of chaos into mix.  Easy to teach and play - a nice 60 minute game with a bit of grunt.  The usual Matagot stunning bits too.  Well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
So far I've only tried it once with 2 players, but it was fun, and seemed to have a fair bit of depth.  There were a few rules hiccups, and the rulebook could have been laid out better and contained more comprehensive information, but we got through it with the help of a posted FAQ.  I think it is a game that will be better with more people, so I'm looking forward to trying that.  Rating could go up or down based on further plays.

Update: After further plays, I find the endgame comes up to quickly and then everyone tries to figure out how to stop someone from winning. It also seems like the kind of game where everyone needs to know how to play otherwise it unbalances the game too much. Not ideal for the type of play groups I usually have.  Putting it up for trade.

RATING: 9
A true hybrid boardgame, with part clever euro bidding - very reminiscent of Amun re, and a dudes on a map style game. Being a hybrid you'd think it would get played more, however it tends to be played less, as generally caving in to player count or other players whims, rather than a utilitarian approach to game selection it doesn't quite satisfy either camp. And often feels that something is missing. The ending can be abrupt, which is ameliorated to a large degree by the titans Expansion which makes the game more combat orientated, and takes the player count up to six with team play. 

However, though this game doesn't get lots of play, every six months or so I feel like playing it and find it extremely satisfying at these times The game play is solid, the components lovely and not over produced, I've had this game for maybe six years and I still feel affection for it, it's a great design and though not my favourite I still see myself enjoying it for years to come. 

I see it as being quite different to Kemet, which is a more intense experience, has better components and is much more of a war game, but I also prefer cyclades on all counts.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
El Cyclades es un juego bastante sólido que se adapta punto por punto a mis gustos: tiene bastante interacción entre jugadores, relativamente poco azar (prima la estrategia), partidas de duración media (unos 90 min), un tema y una estética atrayentes... desde luego, si buscas un juego de conquistas con gestión de recursos (el oro) y construcción de edificios/flotas/tropas, el Cyclades puede ser una buena opción.

De hecho, si no le he puesto más nota es porque tiene un par de inconvenientes que (para mi gusto) le impiden ser un juego de sobresaliente:

 -> Las veces que he jugado, me ha dado la sensación de que después de hora y media de desarrollo más o menos pausado, la partida termina repentinamente. No es uno de esos juegos donde se va viendo quién se desarrolla más y al final de la partida gana quien ha sabido controlar la situación a lo largo de la misma; aquí lo que hay es bastante "tortugueo", con los jugadores reuniendo fuerzas en su rincón del tablero para intentar conseguir repentinamente la victoria en un único y decisivo movimiento (gana quien se hace con dos metrópolis, así que no es tan extraño que alguien pueda conseguir ambas en un solo turno si dispone de la fuerza necesaria para ello).

 -> A causa de lo anterior, la interacción con los demás jugadores es bastante menor de lo que se podría esperar en un juego de conquistas. Todo el mundo teme enzarzarse demasiado pronto con otro jugador, pues eso podría significar quedar demasiado debilitado y permitir que un tercero se alzase con la victoria.

A pesar de estos dos puntos, se trata de un juego muy recomendable, y tiene un par de mecánicas muy bien pensadas (especial mención a la fase en la que los jugadores pujan por ganarse el favor de cada dios).

When I was a kid, my favorite game was "By Jove," a sort-of Monopoly clone where you fought monsters, completed quests, and bargained with the gods, all with a Greek/Roman mythological theme. Since the game was dictated almost entirely by die rolls, it's tough to enjoy it as an adult.

This is why Cyclades is among my favorite games. It takes my beloved theme of Greek myth and mashes it with Euro and war game elements into something tense and meaty with strategy.

RATING: 7
Players fight for control of Greek islands, making sacrifices to the Greek gods in order to get access to their powers -- Ares to recruit and move soldiers, Poseidon to build and move ships, and so forth.  Each god can only be used by one player (the highest bidder) each round, and there are also mythological creatures which can be summoned to attack or interfere with opponents.   First player to build (or conquer) two metropolises wins.

This game looks like a wargame, and acts like a wargame, but the strategy is really in the bidding phase.  As such, it was a much different game the second time we played than the first.  The first was more about positioning and maneuvers.  We laughed at that 10+ spot on the bidding track - who would bid that much?  The second game was all about saving up the gold to grab the crucial god and/or creatures at just the right time to strike the deathblow, and we had bids around 20 gold.  The tension was delicious.

This game is very good, and is one that will really shine with repeated play.

You've really go to keep your eye on the other players to prevent them sneaking a win from under everyone's nose but that's cool.  It forces you to watch and think about everyone, not just whoever you might happen to currently be in direct conflict with.  The auctions are fun and very cut-throat and the whole thing just hangs together very nicely.

One day I might even win...

I am so impressed by this game!  It's just a great mix of bidding, set collection and area control on a small map.  It seems to have just the right level of player interaction while still allowing a player to pursue a strategy somewhat independent of other players' actions.  Played it 4 and 3 player, and both seem very good.

Predict a 6 on the Cindometer since you can invade other players' islands.  She won't like that one bit.

Great game.  There is nothing foreign where game mechanics are concerned.  Beautiful artwork, great integration of Greek mythology & effects.
After multiple plays, I'm certainly a fan, but, I've noticed "Kingmaker" can happen from time to time.

2 fős játékként nálam nem nagyon vált be. Talán azért, mert az ellenfelem nyomasztó fölényre tett szert a papok szerzésével, ami ellen nem tudtam tenni semmit, hiszen 2 játékos esetén a papokat mindkét isten kegyének megszerzésénél fel lehet használni, amivel bármikor fölém tudott licitálni és úgy irányítani a játékot, ahogy kedve tartotta. Általában minden alkalommal meg tudta szerezni Zeusz kegyét (amivel még több papra tett szert) és valamelyik első isten kegyét, amivel a mitológiai lényeket is kihasználta. A játék felétől már csak statiszta szerepkörben tündököltem, esélyem sem volt semmi értelmeset tenni. Így nem jött be, habár maga a játékmenet tetszetős és kíváncsi vagyok, vajon több játékosnál hogyan működik a játék. Hiszen ha valaki látványosan jobban áll a többinél, az könnyen a többiek célpontjává válik :). Egyébként nem túl bonyolult a szabályrendszere, egy játék után elég jól át lehet látni a játékot. Viszont a FAQ ismerete kötelező, mert megelőz egy-két vitás helyzetet. Ha valakinek gondja lenne a nagyméretű isten lapok keverésével, arra találtam egy nagyon jó kis applikációt mobilra, ami rendkívül jól működik. (2015.02.20.)

Love this game. Base game was good, but now I'll only ever play with the Titans expansion - better map, artifacts, ability to move every turn if you've got a titan. I love this auction mechanism (also seen in Amun Re) - second favorite only to Ra.

Absolutely need to get myself the Kemet cross-over kit, more cool monsters with powerful effects!

The auction mechanics are what really drives this game. The ameritrash war elements are more subsiduary.

I fantastic bidding game, where you're trying to gain the favor of the Greek gods. Bidding effects what kind of actions you can perform, and turn order. Has dudes on a map, but blends it with Euro elements very well. Every game has been close with multiple people on the cusp of victory, and all trying to thwart the one coming closest. Goes a bit long.

Primeras dos partidas a dos jugadores. Si bien se hizo un poco larga la primera, por inexperiencia y remisión constante a la hojita de ayuda de las criaturas, nos gustó mucho. Las reglas son muy sencillas y la mecánica se aprehende muy rápido. El juego es muy inmersivo.

Si bien habría consenso en que el número óptimo de jugadores es entre 4 y 5, realmente lo disfrutamos a dos.

Es muy cierto eso que dicen que la partida puede dar un giro radical en un par de rondas. A mí me pasó de no tener casi nada construido pero una buena flota y un ejército decente frente a mi oponente con dos metrópolis y a falta de un filósofo para completar la tercera, y, en un golpe de astucia y alguna ayudita de una criatura que vino a socorrerme, le invadí una isla primero y otra luego y terminé ganando la partida a lo sucio. Excelente!

Lo probamos sin las expansiones que dicen que lo terminan de redondear, así que tenemos una muy alta expectativa por el juego completo.

Edito: A cuatro está excelente pero con menos conflicto. La verdad que es un juego genial.

Beautiful board and bits. Played okay with four. Hated it with three -- the way the Gods come up, you know what's coming every third turn and it made the last turn anti-climatic.

RATING: 9
Cyclades takes troop deployment, movement, and combat; building construction, resource gathering, card selection, and boils all those things down into one major decision each round:  which god do I want to bid on?  There's so much to do in this game, and I really love how the auctions on the god track keeps players focused.  That element of the gods dictating what you can do makes the complexity of the game really manageable and easy to digest. 

This game is also about ten months pregnant with tension as it's usually pretty easy for everyone to get a few steps away from winning.  

I also really love how you need to double bluff your way to victory.  By that, I mean you need one obvious and one not so obvious win option on the board that your opponents will delightfully and mercilessly screw you out of.  They'll feel so triumphant because they bound you, caged you, and threw you into the depths of the ocean, absolutely destroying every chance of victory you ever had.

But then comes the "Aha suckers!" moment where you break your bindings, escape the cage, break through the surface of the water, and micturate all over every one who thought you were so thoroughly beaten; because what they failed to see was the mostly hidden third option that relies on a convoluted four card monster chain.  I always feel like the winner of this game performs the best slight of hand.   Eighty percent of the game is setting up this mind blowing magic trick that will leave everyone groaning in defeat.  It's like having David Copperfield on your living room table.  It's not about auctions, ship battles, infantry skirmishes, building buildings, or getting money.  It's about magic.  Everything else is illusory.

One of the coolest games around.  Unfortunately, the peeps I play games with don't share my love for it.  Perhaps it's because I'm always calling them suckers.  

I have played this game a few times with players who kept doing Appollo, hoarding money, and never using it.  It can be really disruptive to the balance of the game if that money isn't being put to use as using money is how you keep other players in check.

This is a Euro/AT hybrid.  It looked to be an excellent game due to the amazing artwork and how the board scales based on the number of players.  Sadly, the game didn't live up to expectation due to the fact that any given player may only attack on land once per round and on sea once per round (barring special mythological creature cards).  Not only that, if a player does get to attack twice in a round, that means no other players can attack!  What kind of multi-player conflict game have rules set up so that you may not even be allowed to attack in a given round.  Yes, I understand you can win without taking part in many conflicts but............ blahhhhhh!!  It's kind of ridiculous to me.  There were other issues that I didn't like but the above is the crux of it.  There are better Euro/AT hybrids available.

A warcenomics game with a wonderful bidding aspect. You bid for the favor of different gods each turn. The gods determine which actions you can take that turn, so bidding can be pretty heated when you need Ares' favor to march to war but your opponent does too. Cyclades is a blast to play, and the miniatures are fantastic as well.

What I like about Cyclades was the unique balance of using your influence on the God's favor and the area control aspect of the game.  It is clearly not a civilizatin building game and is definitely a war game.  It did suffer some issues though in production.  For instance, all the sales on my black ships have snapped off just being removed from the bag.  I've read that newer versions of this game use wooden pieces for the ships and soldiers which was probably a good idea.  I need to play this game again to see what I think and see if it stays in the collection.

A stunningly beautiful game, well-themed around both Greek mythology and the settlement of the Cyclades.  Its only drawback is an auction mechanism that can produce a degree of frustration as players thwart each other's plans.  However, strategy, flexibility and timing can overcome a lost bid and produce a surprise victory.

RATING: 6
Cyclades is a rather amalgamated euro/at game. Constant bidding to do what you want to do, limited turn actions, and dice-resolved combat. There's a nice looking board and some equally nice sculpts. The gameplay is too long for me and the decisions are too far apart for me to really consider this game to be interesting. For a game like this, I'd much, much rather play Nexus Ops. 

A revisit to this title has made me appreciate the game a lot more. I still am by no means a fan, but I won't be throwing down the veto when this comes out again.

RATING: 9
Cyclades is easy to learn and to teach. The components are gorgeous, and the gameplay is fast-paced and tense. I really like how the auctioning-mechanic works in a confrontational game like that - it adds an additional layer of suspense because of the hidden money, and combined with the special abilities of the mythological creatures it makes for a fun and diverse gaming experience.

What an interesting hybrid game. I should love this game as it has a euro auction element I love in other games (Amun Re, Vegas Showdown) as well as the tactical considerations of a wargame. But my reaction is one of fatigue when I think of this game because of the heavy negotiation and constant leader bashing and rubber-banding required. Like Cosmic Encounter, alliances need to constantly shift with constant accusations of "He's winning! GET HIM!" The constant finger pointing wears me out.

But my problem with king-of-the-hill type games is that they tend to drag on and on as players collar the one about to win, only to then set up one of them as the new leader who must be collared which makes a new player the leader who must be collared…

I especially like the bidding for the favors of the gods. You're not only bidding for their favors, but also the order of play, relative to your direct rivals, and the ability to use one or more of the mythological creatures on offer. When you are outbid, you need to choose another god, adding extra complexities to the bidding process.

Four plays now - Three with the Hades expansion.  I remain to be convinced that the four player game is not flawed (five is better) and that the game generally with any number of players does not end in a see-saw, backwards and forwards of pick on the apparent leader.  I have some concerns about a player in third or lower placings ending up as a kingmaker.  Effective use of the creatures is very important. All games have been far to long (4+ hours) for me to enjoy them, given the game mechanics.

Nice bidding mechanic to gain the gods favour however getting stuck with Apollo and having to effectively skip your turn is lame, the one coin and single prosperity token do not make up for this.

Combat feels tacked on to what is a mediocre bidding game.

Cyclades is a euro-war game that captures the price of waging war. Players compete to build or capture cities from each other. The driving force to the game is the auction round. To win, players need to bid carefully to preserve their limited bank but also push up the cost of auctions so that nothing is too cheap.

I didn't know anything about this game before I got it. Game components' quality is outstanding. The miniatures are so beautiful! Cardboard is thick and nice, too.

This game seems very promising. I have to try it soon

Played 3 times in one night:  2x3 player, 1x4 player.  This is a great game, though better for 4 than 3.  Like everyone else raves, it neatly combines theme and light, Risk-y wargaminess with solid Euro mechanics (auction, engine building).  2 games featured very exciting finishes. The knock on 3 player is it seemed one player ended up being kingmaker, throwing auctions to one or the other.

Both games played have been 5-players.  Not sure I want to play it with less.  Many ways to win, some of them very sneaky and sometimes surprising.  Having enough money to win a God's privilege, and then having enough money left over to benefit from the privilege is a challenge.  Going first can be a huge advantage, especially if you can lock an opponent out of the bidding. 

Card graphics are gorgeous; rules uncomplicated, components very nice. Play is simple but action combinations and options offer a lot of variety.

RATING: 5
For such a beautiful package, this game is a bit of a disappointment.  It suffers from a rich-get-richer problem and the maps seem to favour some initial positions through the accessibility to easy income generating spaces.  The game is mostly driven by the creature cards so an emphasis on cost-reducing Temples and Priests will yield an advantage on the bidding as well as lowering the cost for creatures.  Could and should have been much better.

Man, I wanted to love this game. Theme, artwork, mechanics all seem awesome...but ultimately the rich get richer and the poor are stuck by halfway through the game.

RATING: 8
Un juego con grandes componentes, muy cuidado a nivel gráfico, que es una verdadera gozada verlo en pleno juego.
Sin embargo, a nivel reglas, a mi entender, es relativamente fácil ganar para cualquier jugador, sea cual sea su estilo de juego, o lo que haya hecho previamente en la partida. Espero que se corrija con la expansion Hades.
A 5 jugadores es como realmente se le saca partido, aunque a simple vista pueda resultar un poco caotico.
La partida puede durar hora y media, y si se quiere evitar el efecto arriba descrito hay que estar muy concentrado.

Edit.- Una vez jugado con la expansión HADES, con todos los módulos, le subo la nota a 8 por haber aumentado bastante la dificultad de conseguir una victoria relámpago.

Positives 
easy to teach.
easy to play. 
Auction mechanic is simple and fun.
No run away leaders.
60-120 mins.
gorgeous.

Negatives
table talk (however, more often then not this works to the advantage of the quite players).
unbalanced Zeus ability (which is fixed in hades).
broken Pegasus ability. 
Lack luster combat (this game is clearly not intended to be a combat heavy game so this isn't a huge problem in this game).

Summary
I just played a game with 4 newer players and we all had a blast. Which is important to me. This game is forgiving enough that new players don't feel frustrated early and more seasoned players can be sneaky. This game combined with hades is easily an 8.5 game.

Despues de probarlo, no veo nada claro como puede funcionar a menos de 5 jugadores. Posiblemente la parte de la subasta pierda peso de manera radicalmente progresiva.

Intenta compensarse el juego, acabando facilmete un falso final trepidante, sin importar cuanto se haya trabajado en conseguirlo y dependiendo de la suerte el vencedor.

Figuras muy bonitas, pero debiles y se doblaran facilmente las partes debiles de cada figura.

RATING: 7.5
Highly recommended.

Labelled as a hybrid, but to my mind, firmly a euro. The combat is rarely that swingy and it's the play around the battles that is the meat of the game. The auctions are a big chunk of the game and they're a lot of fun. As a result the game is really a game of planning. Very rarely can things be done in a single turn and you need to carefully and efficiently build up to your decisive actions. Players really need to be vigilant about what other players are up to. There can be a slightly unsatisfying finale to the game if you don't keep track of the less exciting routes to victory - philosophers and buildings.

The board and all of the components are gorgeous - excellent miniatures; nice irregular shaped coins. It all looks fantastic on the table.

Easy rules and easily explained to others yet complex tactics with many surprises to keep things going, almost zero downtime and playtime is perfect (~90-120 Minutes), great scalebility for 2-5 players that actually WORKS, awesome material and art, cool theme. Expansion is recommended since it balances the game to perfection. I played Cyclades with the expansion with at least 10 different persons and everybody loved it, from my girlfriend to the cambridge doctor.
Highest Recommendation.

Nagyon régóta vágytam erre a játékra. Most sikerült végre kipróbálni. Nagy elvárásaim voltak vele kapcsolatban. Mint az ilyenkor lenni szokott kicsit csalódás lett a vége. 
Nem rossz a játék, de azért nem is kiemelkedően jó. Leginkább egy kicsit felturbózótt Rizokóra emlékeztet. Szép alkatrészek, jó hangulat, mély tematika. Tetszett a licitálási mechanizmus, bár papíron konfrontatívabbak gondoltam, mint amilyen a valóságban lett. Nem tetszett viszont a játék íve:
- nehezen indul be, és aztán nagyon hirtelen vége lesz
- minden játékos megnyerheti gyakorlatilag bármelyik pillanatban, így kicsit azon múlik, hogy ki ellen mekkora energiákkal tudnak a többiek összefogni, megelőzve ezzel a játék befejezését.

Elsőre kicsit nyögvenyelősen ment, így szívesen játszanék még vele.

Asmodee is consistently putting out well designed games with gorgeous production and Cyclades is no exception.  The auctions actually make thematic sense (unlike the vast majority of Euro games) and the combat is simple but effective.  Each player color has different molds (nice touch).  The game is fast paced, so every decision matters.  There appear to be multiple ways to achieve the same end goals, so much more to explore in this game.  One of my favorite 2010 releases

Includes: Hades and Titans expansions

Fun hour-long DoaM game, with some Euro elements with the bidding on the gods.

Gorgeous bits, too!

It's busted as shit two-player though, and I wish they hadn't bothered to advertise it as such.  One player gets the advantage, you can pretty much call it.

Other than that, it's a sharp, clean design with great bits.

I love the them of this game, but I feel the game lacks too much interaction. Battles don't seem to happen very often and avoiding them seems like the better strategy. I hear the Titans expansion improves this aspect a lot, so I might need to check that one out. Until then, this game is still good, but it might sit on the shelf for a bit.

I've been wanting to play Cyclades for years now! Finally got the chance. It was slightly less thrilling than my impression was. All nice ideas and everything works well together. But I didn't find the bidding all that exciting and the area control feels like every other Euro of this type. Great component quality! Unfortunately, the creatures only make rare appearances, making them a bit overproduced. Still, I enjoyed it enough that I would play it again. I'm interested to see how the expansions work with it as this game could use a bit more to increase the player involvement.

I love the components, impressive production, I like the mechanics (auction and ameritrashy combat), but there is something that doesn't let me love it the way I want to. I think it's the combat mechanics. Just one die per player and 1 point per army figure, so a large deployment can crush another player without a chance of defending himself. Probably with a house variant for combat (1 die per army or ship figure) can make the game more enjoyable.

Immensely entertaining area control game, featuring Gods who grant the highest bidder special abilities-- and it IS all about the bidding, in the end. Enough conflict without getting out of control, but still light. Perfect level of depth, without leading to much AP. One of my favorites. Great minis, beautiful board and pretty clear rules. Made better by 'Titans' expansion, for closer quarters quarreling and nastiness, once you've gotten plays in with the base game.

the ancient greece and it's myths are the background for another highly thematic and very good game. we represent ancient greek's greatest powers trying to colonize and be the first to put their metropolises in the cyclades islands. it's a tactical game based on the ancient pantheon gods who will grant their favours to the players eho game them the best tribute(in form of a bet), permitting some actions or even the recruitment of the greek myths mytological creatures. the whole game is based on a good management of the islands paying attention to the neigbhours who are never peacefull. best played with at least 3 or 4 people. enjoyable event with 2 player variant even though is clearly made for more

I picked this one up after reading so many good things about Cyclades.  Exceptional components and immersive theme for this area-control / light combat strategy game.  Neat bidding mechanic used "to pay homage to Greek gods" which dictates a player's actions each turn.  Easy to learn and difficult to master.  While it plays decent with 2 and 3 players, I think it would be exponentially more fun with more players.  Seems to reward more aggressive players.  Wish I was better at this game.

Beautiful games. Very nice components and art work in this game. Game play is a lot of fun and pretty easy to learn. I almost everything about htis game, except for the two player rules and only being able to use the monster figures for the one round that they are played. It made them feel kind of weak in my opinion, but I guess it's just something I have to get used to. Fun game though and would definitely recommend it.

RATING: 6.5
fun enough.  thing is, you typically just want to turtle up until someone else builds their metro(s) and then come in after saving up some money and take them over.  that said, it is supposed to be a game of conflict, but a system that rewards somewhat conservative play ends up dragging out longer than needed.  to be fair, my group typically avoids direct conflict..so that may very well have slowed things down more than normal!!

the monsters have limited affect on things as they rarely come up and, for the most part, only hang around for one turn.

need a couple more plays to see if things speed up a bit.

The we played back to back games of Cyclades, first without expansions and then on the new map and the Cyclades: Titans expansion. The game is a lot more fun with the Titan expansion I can tell you. The first game, we were too timid with the bidding for the Gods, but in the 2nd game, we got the hang of it and the bidding was cut-throat and the fighting on the board intense. The team work when someone was ahead was nasty and fun. Loved it.

A game of bidding on gods and placing troops to control territory. Since what you can actually do on any given turn is very limited, the game feels stunted and slow. Board position is almost completely static.

Still, the game staggers along until the end game, where it completely grounds to an agonizing halt. One or two players will be about to win, and everyone must gang up on them to prevent them from winning. Not fun for the players getting ganged up on. One or two players will have no chance of winning, but will have to fall on their swords to keep the game going. Not fun for those players. Eventually (this part took over an hour in our game), someone will sneak through and win.

Our game stretched to 2.5-3 hours, and at that length the game is absolutely awful. 90 minutes of it was interesting, but the end game was miserable.

RATING: 8
Amazing components and theme. This game reminds me of the Dune board game in the way that you bid for powers and how battles are resolved. On the plus side, it's much much faster. (1-2 hours I'd say.)
Players can gang up on other players, which sucks when it happens (to me :()...but the victory conditions and map are always so tight that the end-game is pretty tense.
Nearly everyone I've played with winds up with that feeling, "with just 1 more turn I could have won!"

I do have a problem with allowing as many mythological creature cards to be played as a player can afford. Once someone develops a strong income engine, the last few turns get ridiculous.

RATING: 6.5
My initial rating was based on one play at Essen. This was one of a handful of games that were on my "must play" list (Matagot plus Bruno C = probably a winner!) so I was really looking forward to it. I know that, like another commenter, we received incorrect rules instructions (which we spotted after a few turns), but I don't think that play was affected too much by that. My main disappointment was the "snowball effect" built into the game - anyone getting even slightly ahead in treasure tokens or priests can effectively bully their way into getting whichever god's favours they want, simply by virtue of being able to outbid other players at no cost to themselves. 

Update: I played the game again with a better rules explanation and having read some of the comments here. Although I still think the snowball effect is present (and could dominate), it was a much closer and more enjoyable game - we understood the use of the monsters better, for example (even though few were used). I even managed to very nearly sneak in a win - being forced to almost constantly choose Athena can work to your advantage if nobody's keeping an eye on you!

As a result, I have increased my rating.

My favorite eurotrash board game so far. It has everything i d like in a game, combat, interraction, powers, euro elements, bidding, strategy, and offcourse a great theme. My group loves it, it is clean, easy to learn and to teach, with lots of replayability and it gets even better if you add 1 of the expansions.
-Hades makes the game chaotic in a way some may like, but some may not.
-Titans makes the game tighter(with less emphasis on sea areas), more strategic(to be honest here: i meant ''strategic bloodbath''),and co-op (if played with 4 or 6 players).

This is a great game for this normally direct-conflict averse Euro game lover.  I love the bidding, the powers on the monster cards, and the battling actually works out very well.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable game, and the tightness of the auction really elevates it.

RATING: 7
Great strategic game. The god-praying system to obtain actions and "resources" is very interesting. Sometimes it could be frustrating due to your opponents want to pray to your chosen god and inmediately break your statregy, so you have to always play with two or three alternative strategies. Nevertheless, you've got the feeling that something is missing in this game, I don't know what.

I really love the interactions in this game, the combination of war game and auctions work surprisingly well and the game is always tense as a player can achieve victory at any time once a few metropolises start appearing on the map.

I really like this game - had fun every time we played it.  The components are excellent - probably the best of any game I own.

I've struggled with the strategy and I'm not very good at the game yet.

I will say this - I've only played it with 3 players, and I think this is a game that probably has a very different feel with 4 and 5 players.  I look forward to playing with more people.

Recommended.  Tough to describe this game.  You bid on each Greek god each turn to help you out in some way for building your empire or conquering some other player's.  You can also purchase monsters that will help you out in the game.  It's fun, and best with 5 players.  I would avoid playing a 3 player game.

the greek mythology theme won me over and i cannot gush about the components enough. this game is definitely over-made. fun game! though, i am a huge fan of luck-driven dice rolling combat! however, i do have one complaint about how difficult it can be to wage land battle with someone and conquer their island, since only ares gives you the ability to do so. i heard this is somewhat fixed in the new hades expansion.

Nice blend of Euro and Ameritrash elements (definitely leaning heavily on the Euro side still). Adds some tension and direct combat to the auction Euro, which makes this game feel very fresh. 

I don't like the winning condition, though. The race to two metropolis has some flaws:
1) shorter than desired game time
2) victory often comes out of nowhere as a result of one unpredicted and powerful move 
3) OR victory can be seen a mile away with the outcome unstoppable.

Extremely thematic with a fun bidding component that adds a unique complexity to the strategy of the game.

The goal of Cyclades is to control 2 Metropolys, either by building them or by stealing them from an opponent.  At the start of a turn, there's an auction on Gods until every player have one God.  Each God have a different power and each of them let you recruit and/or build something different.

Excellent hybrid between american and euro design which plays very smoothly. Cyclades is a dudes on a map where the main way to select your actions is through winning the right to do them via intense auctions. The production is great, with vibrant art and well made miniatures (with different molds for each player color!). 
Teaching it is a breeze, mostly because it looks more complex than it actually is.
It also plays quickly, compared to most other games in its type.
Bonus points for playing well with two players!

RATING: 7
A nail-biting bidding game where sometimes you bid on a thing you don't even want in the hope that somebody will outbid you and leave you free to pursue your actual plan.

But what you're bidding on is actions in a dudes-on-a-map game, and despite the Euro mechanics + tension, often I really just don't want to build armies to defend buildings. So for me, the strategies are cleverly balanced in terms of their game-winning potential, but not in terms of how much fun they are. And I think that not feeling fully flexible keeps me from sinking my teeth all the way into this game.

A very good game where the available actions are auctioned among the players every round. There is a single objective - to have two metropolises - but several ways to accomplish it. There are quite a few random elements to spice things up, and mythological creatures have a very important role in helping or disrupting the players' best plans. In fact, the luck of the draw that dictates the  order of their appearance may be a bit excessive sometimes. The game may also drag a little as the players try to prevent others from winning. But it has just the right level of confrontation to fit the theme without making it lose the Euro feel. There isn't a single novel element, but known mechanics are combined into a unique and very interesting game. On the production side, it is as gorgeous as I have come to expect from Matagot, with wonderful miniatures and Miguel Coimbra's artwork.

Another game I wanted to play, even though I had the feeling I wouldn't like it much and that's how it went.

There's too much luck for my liking. Away from the dice (do we really need stupid dice rolls for fighting these days?!), the available actions (with less than 5 players) and their positions add more luck to it.

Kingmaking is just another problem...

RATING: 9
Cyclades may look like a typical "dudes-on-a-map" game in the vein of Risk, but in practice this is only about half true. The other half of the game is an auction, yet these two sides are beautifully intertwined into a cohesive whole.

The goal of the game is to control two metropolises. A metropolis is comprised of four different buildings. Each building is granted by a different god, so a player wishing to construct one will have to eventually win the favor of all four gods. However, one can also control a metropolis simply by taking it from another player. The board contains various islands, some of which generate money each turn. This money is what is used to bid on the favor of the various gods. Yet each god has a different way of bringing you closer to your goal. Some allow you to move your people around the map, gaining more money production or fighting over buildings/metropolises, some make things cheaper for you to buy, and some can even help you towards a metropolis through card collection (a completely different way of getting one). 

The real brilliance of the game comes in forcing tough decisions on a player. There is never enough money to do exactly what you want, and players will step on each other's toes even without direct attacks. There will be times where you need to go first in a round, but this means you will go last in the next round. Masterful play demands planning AT LEAST a round ahead, sometimes more. Each god allows for various abilities, all useful, but all demanding payment. And that's not even getting into the various mythological monsters that show up each round. Some are extremely powerful, and a player that ignores them (or at least their potential) will be in a world of hurt.

Cyclades is conflict done right. It is a brutal struggle against the other players at the table that manages to avoid feeling like a "take that!" kind of game. Every action you take has far-reaching effects on everyone else at the table, and they know it. Their question is the same question you must answer about them: is it worth me paying to stop this from happening or should I focus on my own goals? Every turn is a choice between defense and offense, or some hybridization. There is never a "surprise win" or runaway leader with experienced players. It always comes down to management of risk and management of resources. This game is a masterpiece. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Nerve racking waiting for the bidding to unfold.  Really good game.  Nice bits.  Lots of options to victory.  Fastest game taught in a long time for its complexity.  Money is really important.  Try to buy two buildings at once.  Zeus is really important. And doing a down turn with Apollo and then in position to do what you want.

If ever in the mood for a "dudes on a map" game - play Cyclades. The setting is great and the mechanics ensure that the game does not fall in to the trap that other "dudes on a map" games fall into, which is that the game never ends. There's tension in the bidding mechanic and the game allows for different paths to victory. Simply excellent.

The rating is with the Hades expansion. Without it I would rate the game an 8.

Swings wildly, random bid order for gods' favor just doesn't work for me.  The mechanic just doesn't seem to fit the theme for me, for what reason I know not at the moment.

The more players the better. I'm looking forward to playing this with the expansion some time, though I'm not sure it was really needed - part of what made the game so awesome was its reduce-to-the-max vibe, and how the whole interaction worked out when everybody was blocking everybody else. But more ways to achieve victory are cool I'm sure.

Edited after the first play with the expansion and rated down from 9 to 8.5 - the game was over too quickly with one player setting up a win in one round and executing it in the next. The winner had a flawless strategy and thus kind of deserved to win, but still, what I like about the game is the tense and exciting endgame, and we didn't have one like that in that play.

Maybe the rating will improve with more plays with expansion again. Not sure who will be the victims though :p

This is a quite good game which indeed plays in about one hour; I like my games short, but I think I would like it more if it were a bit longer.

The version we played had wooden pieces...
Our 5-player game dragged and was longer than 3 hours.  Players would bid and overbid, in an attempt to block one another.  I was able to build my first metropolis on the last turn of the game... Was able to get Ares (God of War) once during the game...  Mythological creatures unbalances what could have been a balanced game...  The player with the most money has an advantage that appears difficult to overcome.

After a second game (4-players this time), found it to be too dependent on luck (die rolls in combat, card draw for creatures, as well as the Gods when played with less than 5 players).  And it dragged, again, over 2.5 hours... If one player plays badly, it really skews the game, and then there is the dreaded King Maker moves...  After 2.5 hours, really??

Not recommended.

Not a bad Euro-American-style hybrid. I do think the Euro parts work better though. It has a nice auction similar to Amun-Re where if a player outbids you you're forced to bid on something else. Every player ends up having bought the special powers of a specific Greek god, which allows for different special actions. Meanwhile there are about 2 dozen special power cards that you can buy for extra cash, ranging from useless to absurdly powerful. I didn't like this bit as much, especially because they really require a separate sheet to decipher--the hieroglyphs on them are laughably obtuse. The random combat is so-so. I tend to play defensively in games like this, buy enough guys to keep others from messing with my plans with their random combat. It almost worked, too. The presentation goes pretty far: the minis and the board are very nice, as are the graphics, barring the low usability of the iconography. If this were an ugly game it would get a 6, but it's a pretty game, so 7. (rating after 1 play)

Very dissappointed after one play. The component is nice, but that is the only good thing that I can say about this game.

The eurogame part of it feels flat and the ameritrash part is boring. As a eurogame lover, I hate this game because it is impossible to plan. All you can do is making the tactical choice. If you have happened to build up an engine that helps your long-term strategy, somebody would ruin it, unless you have enough money to go first every turn and hire all the creatures that may harm your plan. Bidding has no depth because the choice is so obvious so usually it becomes a contenst of who-has-the-most-money. The purple god is way too overpowering - whoever goes to the purple guy gains a huge advantage against others. So I'm guessing after several plays every game will become the same: everybody rushes to the purple guy in the beginning and gangs up on the guy finally gets to visit the purple guy the most later on. Wait, did I mention the total random draw of creature cards?

RATING: 5
The Auction mechanic is cool, as is the whole game. I like the easy area control, the ressource & the dice fighting.. oh and the greek monsters & gods are really cool.

What i don't like, as in many of these games, is the leader-bashing towards the end. But once people are aware of that, everyone tries to look weak & suddenly win in one round (wich does work in this game).

Oh and once you're way behind, there are three cool mechanics that makes it easy & fun to catch up.

I like this actually better than Kemet wich has some similarities & is from Matagot aswell. But in Cyclades area & space matters. Not in Kemet.
_______________

Yeah the end-game bothers me.. if everyone is made aware of who's about to win.. often it becomes three player orchestrating their actions to stop the fourth from winning.. until that changes & a new triple entente  is formed to gang up on the leader. Does make the early game seem a little redundant.

If I said that Cyclades was a Mediterranean based civilization game where each city state attempts to build up their nation with fleets, armies, cities and philosophers, comparisons to Gerdt's Antike would be accurate enough, but...

In some ways Cyclades feels stready & inevitable, like Antike, but it adds the interaction of auctions for turn order, the creatures to increase intercation and special activities, and a small slate of available actions for each God in a player's turn.

The result is terrific.  It's a shoulder to shoulder rush to take and hold onto enough resources to climb to the top of a slippery rock, but taking care not to let someone else follow you, or find an even better path to the top.

Strong game, justifiably top 100 stuff. 7 on an initial solo play w 4 players

It feels like a wargame and a eurogame put together. It works very well and it's pretty fun but sometimes you'll have to plan ahead. You have to do a lot of planning to attack (win a bid to build fleets, and then win another bid to build and army and attack) wich can pause the game a bit. This can be a bit frustrating if you can't manage to win some bids. The Titans expansion pretty much fixes this so I really recommend getting it.

As close as you can get to ameritrash without getting hurt. Requires attention to what is happening on the board because one person can (an usualy do) suddenly win the game in just one move. Can be played while drunk ;p

One play with 2: good, but need to try more. It was so tight for space and for victory-conditions that it forced a lot of conflict, and then boiled down to one climactic battle that went against probabilities. Anticlimactic. Maybe with more players there is more opportunity to construct a strategy.

Glad I got to play this.  The components are excellent & it's quite well designed.  I think the bash-the-leader/kingmaker issue detracts from the enjoyment for me.

There are other 'fighting' games I prefer more & other 'auction' games I prefer.  Combining the two doesn't really work for me.

I'm actually quite terrible at this game, but boy do I love playing it. The base game is not horrible but combine it with Titans and oh man makes it into a completely different beast altogether. What I love is Titans did bring anything extremely difficult to the base game, which makes it easy to teach new players. My only gripe is that the expansion is a bit pricy for what it brings, but still an awesome game, that takes a bit of to pick up but when it does, it starts to steam-roll. 

Needs to hit the table more. Solid game fun game. Now to try out Kemet and see which one my game group prefers...

Great theme and beautifully produced (gotta love the kraken). Apart from that it wasn't fun and the ending left me very cold. Everyone is within a turn or two of winning at the end so the winner will just be whoever slips under the radar, gets king-made, or gets lucky at the right time.

This game was an immediate hit with my group, specifically because the bidding aspect of the game was so much fun. I think this is because we do like conflict in our games, and while you can attempt to sit back and build without resorting to any military actions, the bidding ensures that you'll be interacting with other players as much as possible.

I hate auctions.

HOWEVER, this one makes them fun. The "no immediate outbidding" rule makes auctions much more exciting, and the rest of the gameplay as well as the actual things your are bidding on (the right to take certain actions) make it great.

Edit: Rating improves with more plays

RATING: 8.5
Great multiplayer conflict game because of:
- well implemented theme
- the auction mechanic (same as in Amun Re) makes the choice what to do much easier
- simple and clear set of rules (combat and maneuver are very simple but yet effective)
- variety through the mythological creatures
- it is not chaotic (as in everyone attacking everyone every turn)
- lot of playing experience in a rather stort play time

The downsides for some people (but not me) might be:
- dice have a say in combat results
- it is a conflict game, i.e. you have to attack and you will be attacked

Without the titans expansion this game is all right. I think there are games that scratch a similar itch that I would rather play. Turtling is a huge problem but I don't think that's a problem due to players but rather due to the only movement god being Ares.

Excellent jeu! Le thème de la Grèce mythologique est très bien rendu même avec le design à l'intérieur de la boîte. Le système d'enchère pour chosir ses actions apporte une tension entre les joueurs. J'aime qu'il y a plus d'une façon d'avoir les métropoles: philosophes, constructions ou guerres. C'est un jeu qui commence lentement, mais qui s'accélère rapidement en fin de partie. Et bien sûr: superbes miniatures de certaines créatures mythologiques et de différentes miniatures pour chaque joueur.

Amazing game! Theme of the mythological Greece is very well made even with the design inside the box. The auction system to choose your actions brings tension between players. I like the fact there is more than one way to get a metropolis: philosophers, construction or wars. This is a game that starts slowly but accelerates rapidly in end game. And of course: beautiful miniatures of some mythological creatures and different miniatures for each player.

RATING: 2
This game is the most chaotic, obnoxious, Munchkin-in-ancient-Greece piece of crap. The end game is an hour of people ganging up on the leader so that, when somebody is finally able to win, it's through some horribly cheap and completely shallow exploit (usually of Zeus' dumb card cycling power). The cards ruin what could be a kind of ok game. Zeus drives it into the ground.

It's not wholly unfun for the entire game, but it's never super exciting. The end knocks it from a 5 (completely average) to meet Munchkin's 2 rating.

Played first time with boys (9 & 11). All of us enjoyed it. Younger son even won after invading his father's isle and taking over his metropolis. Will have to teach him a lesson next time we play. :devil: Most likely he will just school me again. 

We all liked the the minis and the mix of Euro and Ameritrash. Beautiful board and bits. Would be cool to add metal coins and get minis painted. 
Slow build up to the end with the choice of two gods each cycle (3-player game). [Update: We forgot to shuffle the gods after every other cycle. Would have made it more interesting.] Would have liked to have a choice of all four, but see how that could wonk it all up a bit, especially the bidding, which I enjoyed. 

Definitely going to be played again soon. I'm sure wife/mom will like this one too.

A few days later and I enjoyed my revenge vicariously as the wife invaded the younger son's island to capture his temple and port for the win! And a new family favourite was born! 

It's nice to see the boys progressing beyond children's games and easier family fare. We're not giving anything up, just expanding horizons, and Cyclades is a great first "gamer's" game for the whole family. 

The rule set is a bit extensive but not extreme. It's pretty straightforward and makes the turns pretty simple. You just have to plan ahead, save up some gold and hope the right gods turn up when you need them.

RATING: 8
Good tight game.  I think the bidding mechanic to win the favor of the Gods really makes the game.  Also the order of the Gods and their position during the turn can make a big difference in what a player does.

Great scalability with the different maps depending on the number of players.

Essentially an Ameritrash style game with a decent mix of theming and conflict.  The only problem is that they did not tackle many of the classical problems of multiplayer wargames (bring down the leader, interminability) with any clever answers.  So, I suspect this might actually be a very good 2 player game, but less egaging as a multiplayer game.

RATING: 7
This was an easy 8 for me for the first two hours, then it dropped after playing TWO MORE hours but I am giving the game the benefit of the doubt and blaming our group. Not for AP which there wasn’t any, BUT for all the metagaming table talk and leader bashing which dragged the game out. It WAS fun but you might want to put a limit on how much tabletalk is allowed because 4 hours was 2 hours too long, though I'm not sure just stopping tabletalk will cut it since leader-bashing seems to be the way to go which prolongs the end, might need a tweak of some sort. 

Anyway other than that I was pleasantly surprised with the game and thought it was well done overall.  Luck surpisingly didn’t seem to be an issue for me even in the combat and you could tell your odds more or less going in.  Interesting powers, gorgeous components, pretty nifty theme.  Probably best with 4, we played with 5.  Liked the auction too, similar to an Amun-re style.

on the fence with this game. Enjoy playing but dice rolling for combat bothers me. Need more plays
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very interesting game!  You control armies and fleets in the aegean and maneuver to meet the victory condition (two metropolises).  Each turn you bid on one of the gods, each of which is associated with a unique order (such as Mars for moving armies and attacking with them, as well as recruiting more armies and also buying one of the ingredients for a metropolis, a fort).  It's actually a fairly simple game of positioning and bluffing.  You can normally see an attack coming a turn ahead and head it off.  The most interesting aspect of the game are the monsters, each of which has a special power, which you can hire at the end of each turn.  Typically someone wins by making a surprise move by hiring a monster and using its power in a way no one had foreseen.  Very fun when you pull it off!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
The game ends when a player gets two metropolises, which can be a somewhat lengthy process if you build from scratch.  Much quicker however, if you conquer them!  I suppose some people may not like having the ability to swoop out of nowhere to win by taking over a metropolis, but that's part of the tension in this game, and spurs much of the strategy discussions on the table.

RATING: 8.5
Really beautiful game and I'm not talking about the components. The design is perfected in such a way that allows one to have a deep and fun game in a short amount of time (relative to other games of this type). In addition, the game can be taught in less than ten minutes or so.

The only down side for newcomers are the individual creatures cards that come up but, since each new card starts at the "4" spot, as long as you pause to explain what each one does when it shows up it isn't a problem. Of course, they might ignore the significance of a particular card (or combination of cards) but that is what experience is for and building that in Cyclades is a pleasure.

This game is tight, it begins with a relatively constricted position - it gets right to the point - dilly-dalliers *will* lose. This doesn't mean you need to attack everyone, in fact, with Athena and a peaceful use of Ares every now and then can win the game.

One of the flaws of this game becomes evident when you play with sufferers of analysis paralysis: It's difficult to convince them that sometimes it's impossible to predict what will happen when there are three or more people behind them to bid one of three or more auctions. You can just see their eyes shifting to each god and their gears turning... "Well, if I bid on Ares for 6 and John picks Poseidon and Mary then outbids him and John is then forced to try and take Ares from me and if he does and I then choose Athena for 3, will Mike really let me have it or will my underbid force him to outbid me so I can bid on Ares again... but what if Mary outbids me instead of kicking John off of Poseidon... ??" My last game, which was a blast, dragged on because of one person going through that process turn after turn. Some things just aren't predictable but just try and convince an AP sufferer of that...

Great game. Classic "knife fight in a phone booth" area control. You typically see a couple of turns of peace, and then it turns into a bloodbath! I love the snowball effect of the game. It feels like a lot of work for a player to get to that first metropolis, but, once they do, the game is usually over in only a few more rounds.

Very smooth mechanics. All of the gods feel useful (even Apollo). You have to play aggressively to win- no turtling here!

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2011)

Cyclades tricked me, I saw in a convention this game and I was hooked, the miniatures were gorgeous, however when I got to play the game,  it was a HUGE disappointment, the great white minis didn’t have the impact I thought so, in our game, they almost didn’t appear. Also it was kind of boring. I would play again to properly rate and comment, but I almost always shy away from the opportunity.

I DO like the bidding mechanic.

For me, Cyclades is a regular game, I remember I felt this is another “bash the leader” game until everyone is at the same level and someone manages to pull through,  I have come to dislike this feature in a game (with some exceptions).

Current Rating: 4.5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.25
War style game where you enlist the favor of the gods to move troops, military and mythical creatures to eliminate your opponents. The game, as a war game, includes a strong "take that" element but the manner in which the gods are chosen and mythical creatures appear and are enlisted make for a more strategic game than simply a chaotic war game. Although I generally don't like take that style games this game is an exception, is super fun, creative, well designed, and thematic.  The expansions are great and improve the overall experience by adding more gods and moving capabilities.

The beauty's more than skin deep - lots of fast-paced  fun to be had with this one. Some planning required but also lots of finger-pointing, knife-edge double-dealing and backstabbing.

If confrontational games give you the heebie-jeebies you may wish to avoid, otherwise well worth a try

RATING: 10
- Love this game because, despite all the back and forth, it often comes down to multiple players all being able to win individually in the last round.
- I like how it's possible, but not necessary, to play aggressive right from the start. Many games it's very difficult to successfully pull off an early push for the win. Players can also win through turtling, a surprise push, or some card+action combos.
- Despite the previous comment, the game doesn't really suffer from a run-away leader problem as it's not impossible for players to come-back after a massive beat-down, or take down a player with a strong position.
- Definitely recommend the expansions. Titans effectively turns this into two distinctly different games. I can't make my mind up as to which I prefer, however there are expansion modules I enjoy with/without Titans.
- Teaching isn't too hard. 
- 5-6 players, can be a little slow, though still fun.
- Bit of randomness, but manageable and everyone's in the same boat.

Fun game that combines Euro and Ameritrash elements quite skillfully.  My only concern is that the acceleration from mid-game to end-game seems to be unpredictably rapid.  Perhaps more skill from the players mitigates this.  Of course, given that this game is not well suited for 3, our most common number, we may not ever get that good.

An incredibly thematic game made up of careful bidding and methodical warfare. Despite the fact that some games can finish rather abruptly; the Hades expansion tends to remedy this problem, making Cyclades a blast to play.

Only had a quick play of this but it's looking really, really promising. Love the bidding mechanism for the Gods and love the "Small World" like territory mechanic.  Didn't get much time with the Creatures but I'm sure that's going to add plenty to an already enjoyable experience.  Just the right amount of luck and a good chunk of strategy.  I was playing the other night with the G/F and, whilst we were having a practice game, out of nowhere she came within 1 round of winning.  If you're not careful, it looks like things can turn arond really quickly, hopefully leading to some close, nail-biting finishes.

Taking this on holiday to get some games in prior to rating.  Can't wait...

Cyclades hits a sweet spot for me. Great interplay of engaging theme and mechanics; fun, meaningful and competitive player interaction; memorable sessions through emergent narrative; excellent balance of skill and luck, with just the right amount of randomness to keep players on their toes at all times.

It's not a perfect game (but then, no game is). Five-player games in particular can involve a late-game kingmaking pile-on and drag on for too long as a result. Sometimes the randomness goes a bit over the top and no amount of skill can help you win when the circumstances simply favor another player too much (mostly through the monster track and battle dice pratfalls).

But none of that really matters. No other game has ever made me feel such joy as my best Cyclades games have, regardless of whether I've won or lost.

Cyclades is currently the best game I own and one of only two games I've ever played that I can confidently rate a full ten.

Quite fun, there is an element of being able to run away, but I think if you are playing with good gamers, it's less likely to happen, and more likely they will just shut you down instead. I suppose if you played it perfectly, and no one ever opposed you you could get so far ahead that it would be impossible to lose.

RATING: 9
Cyclades is a game of beautifully controlled chaos. There are enough stable elements that players can form and implement a robust strategy, but enough random elements that those plans are continually subject to fate and chance. The auction mechanics provide layers of decision making and tension. The variable order of the powers has a tremendous impact on the game, and is a factor all players must navigate. The mythological creatures bring an arsenal of possibilities to the fray, and this addition alone takes the game from good to great. These factors make for a dynamic, engaging experience as well as immense repeat playability. Add in the high quality components and stunning artwork and Cyclades earns masterpiece status.

most often with new players the game will end with a whimper because nobody realized one player could win that turn.  if players are savvy though, the auction becomes this enormous money sink which hopefully equalizes player's positions

Even though every round you're earning the favor of the same gods to take the same actions, Cyclades stays tense and engaging from start to finish. The bidding is a mind game, and it's only made more so by the fact that (generally) it takes two successful bids for an opponent to attack you. The ever-changing availability of monsters-for-hire adds just the right amount of randomness and variability. An excellent game.

We've played this a lot now, and my gaming group tends to really over-think a game. I think this game is beginning to crack, and I hope to get the expansions for a bit of lubrication.

I love the theme, the bidding system, the miniatures, and the board for this game. And it really is Age of Mythology in a box (I'm a big islands guy for AOE).

Why the rating is dropping: Okay maybe the expansion fixes this, but the game does have a "I build, you steal" problem which all pre-Skythe games probably have tbh!

Cyclades es un juego de conquistar/defender territorios. Los jugadores lucharán por hacerse con islas donde puedan construir cuatro tipos distintos de edificios. Cuando un jugador consigue los cuatro automáticamente se transforman en una "megapolis". El objetivo del juego es tener 2 de ellas al final de una ronda.

Hay dos grandes mecánicas en este juego. Una de ellas es la fase de subasta, donde los jugadores pueden pujar por conseguir el favor de 5 Dioses distintos. A través de estos Dioses los jugadores pueden reclutar tropas, construir barcos, coger sacerdotes y filósofos y también construir el edificio especial de cada Dios.

La otra gran mecánica es el uso de las cartas mitológicas. Se colocan en un track y cada ronda es rellenado hasta tener 3 cartas, pagando 4, 3 y 2 monedas por usarlas, dependiendo del sitio en el que estén. Estas cartas cartas aportan una manera distinta de conquistar o defender islas.

Pero la parte más chula de este juego es su grafismo... es impresionante, desde el tablero hasta el libro de reglas.

SOLTAD AL KRAKEN!!!

Cyclades is a game about conquering/defending territories. Players will fight for taking islands where they can build four different kind of buildings. When a player gets the four of them automatically they turn into a "megapolis". The goal of the game is possesing 2 of them at the end of a round.

There are two big mechanics in this game. One of them is the auction phase, where players can bid for getting the favour of 5 different Gods. Via these Gods players can recruit troops, build ships, take priests and philosophers and also build the special building of each God.

The other big mechanic is the use of the mythological cards. They are put in a track and each round it's filled up to three, paying 4, 3 and 2 coins for using them depending of the place they are. These cards add a different way to conquer or defend islands.

But the coolest part of this game is the artwork... it's awesome, from its board to the rulebook.

RELEASE THE KRAKEN!!!

The game is simply gorgeous; quite possibly the best looking game I currently own and the best production that I've seen thus far.  Of course, I am a big sucker for Greek mythology, so that helps, too.  

If you have a group that likes a bit of conflict with thier strategy games,  this is near  perfect as a Euro-y war game filled with auctioning and war/civ strategy.   Awesome.

One of the best choices in case of 5 Players. Cool in many ways. Hard decisions related to strategy planning and coin management. Also it's very difficult to control other players' evolution, and you can lose many games for not being able to see other's victory coming: an apparently harmless opponent's choice can turn in a devastating combo. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Lovely looking game with a neat bidding mechanism to determine who can do what.  In the end, however, Cyclades is still a typical light multiplayer wargame with all of the usual problems - the player who avoids combat best will have the best chance, all of the players need to constantly keep each other in check and the game will end when someone makes an error which inadvertently hands the game to another player and the best strategy is to 'fly under the radar' and look for an opportunistic win.  Other games which have exactly the same issues are: Mare Nostrum, Antike, Twilight Imperium.  All of these games have various bells and whistles which make them look different but they all boil down to the same kinds of situations - the question is how fun the ride is to get to that point and how drawn out the endgame is.  Cyclades is a fun game, but don't come here expecting new solutions to the same old problems.  I expect that eurogamers will find the direct combat annoying and ameritrashers will find the bidding annoying.  I think the euro side of the game is the stronger.  I DO like the auction for the gods abilities - it works very well - but the whole wargame side of it is just a bit pop-gun: there is no teeth. I just don't FEEL like I am in a clash of the titans type event - I think that is inherent in such a game which reduces a wargame to its bare basics and sacrifices epic-ness for speed of play. Its a simple trade-off which everyone will have their own point on the spectrum. Imagine a spectrum with Twilight Imperium III at one end and Cyclades at the other - I would sit at about half way at a two hour game with some thematic depth: Mare Nostrum and AOE3 would be there. I used to think Shogun was there too but its actually longer than those other two with less thematic depth (its still a very good game). That's not to say that these games are perfect - they aren't - but they are for me the right balance between theme and playing time. But I can also play TI3 and Cyclades too.  Other random thoughts: Pegasus is just too powerful compared to the other myth creatures.

Excellent game, plays fairly quick and I love the theme. The game offers a lot of challeges and there are more than enought cards to help everyone win if you plan how your going to use them.

Gorgeous art. Decent Ameritrash Greek mythology romp. Fun bidding system (and having to re-bid on another track is nice, streamlines auctions by making people do "honest" bids). Endgame is kind of a free-for-all once more than a couple of metropolises are built, seems kind of random who ends up winning.

Played a 5 player game.

Lots of interesting stuff going on here. The auction mechanic is similar to Amen-Re, but the value increase is linear here and has no cap. 

You never seem to have enough to do everything you want in a single turn. The mythical creature cards adds a great deal of variation. The turn order can sometimes be important.

I love the theme.

I like the balance of auction and risk. It definitely outdoes risk in its mechanics. I feel it may be the best use of theme I've ever seen. Less thematic games feel abstracted and mechanical; more thematic games involve reading and interpreting cards, which can bog down game play. I love the balance it strikes between direct confrontation, and indirect interaction. Doesn't hurt that the components are absolutely amazing.

I have a moderate dislike for conquest games, mainly since I dislike the "gang up on the leader" combat aspect that goes along with them.  Cyclades definitely addresses it somewhat, since it requires a bit of work (including winning an auction) to be able to attack.  But I found that the auctions, which I anticipated being one of favorite parts of the game, ended up constraining your choices in a way that I found too limiting.

I can appreciate what the designers were trying to do - I think that Cyclades gives a fairly good civ-lite experience in a good time frame.  That said, I'm tired of these types of themes and have a bias against these types of games anyway, so my rating is not entirely fair.  I wouldn't be against trying the game again, but I can't see this one ever becoming a favorite.

Interesting game based on Greek Mythology. Part of game is bidding (players bid gold to the Gods to get their powers), and the other part of the game is war. Players attempt to knock the other guy off their islands. I suppose its possible to win without fighting (i.e. all Priests, but if the other players catch you doing it, you'll be pretty defenseless).

Problems: the biggest one is that victory is visible (you will know when someone is going to win). If a player is one step away from winning, the group will have stop him. So there is too much kingmaking near the end.

Components are great, its quite fun and the game is simple enough to learn for newbies.

Strange feelings of never being out of it, and also never being in it while playing.  Players usually win out of nowhere due to the Pegasus.  Zeus card cycling into Pegasus or Chimera to replay Pegasus seems to be the only real way to win.

This is a game I loved, until I realized I did not have fun playing it. Every part of it sounds cool: the Amun-Re auctions, the paying to boost your turn's action, the threshold victory condition, the simple combat system, the monster cards. However, when at the table, the game ends up being "chicken" with no one wanting to buy the first metropolys, and the last bid on Ares being the winner. Actually, constantly bidding on Ares, with some turns on Poseidon to self your fleet up, seems to be the only strategy.

This game made me realize I don't like the auction mechanic.  I enjoyed it online with Vegas Showdown but this just felt very limited in its choices.  The battle system was very standard and didn't add a lot to the game.  The mythologic creatures are fun to get but they are a very small part of the game.  This was a fast decision for me to get rid of it.

RATING: 6
Cyclades is a Euro-Risk hybrid with dudes on a map and set collection to obtain game-winning buildings, ideally when no one can simply yank them away. Euro-like elements include auctions for roles (which comprise sets of specific actions and purchases), engine aspects (income and discounts); and tactical inertia (creating lanes of attack and attacking normally can't happen in a single turn). Risk-like elements include dice-based combat resolution (albeit with a compressed range of variable outcomes); action cards that shake up game fundamentals (notably by increasing or decreasing tactical inertia); and targeting other players with hostilities (which may involve transfer of hard-earned resources). My concern is that the game will tend to approach an endgame where everyone has one metropolis built, someone will acquire a second, and one or two other players will be in a position to relieve them of it, possibly through overt collaboration. This can happen in lots of map-dude games, but here the game end conditions - and the steps taken to snatch the victory from one player and hand it to another - are especially transparent.

2017-06-12 - 6 - I felt tired after this one. It lasted way too long (like 2,5 hours). But 3 out of 4 players were inexperienced (including me). I liked it more than Kemet but it didn't impress me as I expected and I'm afraid it can last very long if players go back and forth all the time. I could play it again, but I guess I would prefer it with very well regarded expansion or two. But if I want to play long area control game I would choose the awesome El Grande, which can last 2 hours but it will end in the certain moment and is exciting during whole game.

Unrated as I've only played it once with 3 players. This is definitely the wrong player count for this game. I liked the straightforward mechanics and simple design, but at 3 players, the god powers alternate in pairs of 2, which throws off the balance, since you always know which 2 powers will be available next turn. That feels "off" from a design perspective. I suspect I would enjoy this much more at 4 or 5 players.

Nem értem, hogy az ilyen jellegű játékokat miért nem ajánlják kétfősként. Szerintem kiváló, a lehető legtisztább felállás, és a Cycladeshez hasonló konfrontatív játékok esetében kimondottan feszült csatározás zaljik a végső győzelemért. A Cyclades nagyon szép, viszonylag egyszerű szabályrendszerű, de mégis összetett játék. Szerintem a licitálós része szuper (pedig nem szeretem a licitálást), de alapvetően az egész nagyon hangulatos. A csaták gyorsan lezajlanak, nem tűnnek túlságosan fájdalmasnak. Még jónéhányszor elő fog kerülni, az tuti!

A light fun euro bidding/ameritrash conquest style game which is easy to play and teach even to non-gamers. It has amazing component quality and if it weren't for the fact that there is a semblance of an insert in the box you would think it was made by Fantasy Flight.

I love the theme, love the bits, love what you're doing in the game, and love the decisions you have to make from turn to turn.  But I'm not quite as crazy about the winning conditions (owning two metropolises), which seems both a bit too "easy" in some respects and is too obvious to track.  So the game has some potential to drag on as people continually gang up on the leader and try to stop them.  Still, though, it's a lot of fun and will see a LOT more play in my group.

One of my favorite games. Only a "7" as it's not right for some types of gamers.  There are a series of really great mechanics and excellent flavor, that ultimately makes this my favorite "war game".  That being said, it can have a long-ish playing time, and the war aspect of it isn't appealing to everyone.  Unlike most war games there are other paths to victory, but they are more subtle and hard to rely as as much as ships and soldiers.

Difícilmente se podrán encontrar muchos juegos que rivalicen con éste en calidad de componentes y diseño gráfico. Desplegarlo es una delicia; jugarlo, también.

I have only played the game once now, and quite enjoyed it.  It was simple enough to follow, and the game mechanics I felt worked well.  It was a 3 player game that was over in 1 hour
A fair amount of Chaos in the game, so those who like set in stone strategies, you may have a hard time with this game.  You can't always use the same old strategy over and over and over each time you play, you have to roll with the punches!  There is a way to beat every strategy in the game, so you have to watch carefully what all the other players are doing, and prepare yourself.

RATING: 6
I like aggressive eurogames (like Wallenstein) and in this genre Cyclades is mostly fine. However it has few major flaws: Cyclades relies too heavily on players attacking the person closest to reaching victory (which makes the game feel a bit pointless and definitely makes it last too long for example compared to Wallenstein, which lasts a set number of turns). Also some of the action cards are wildly more powerful than others, Pegasus especially is so useful that other cards sometimes seem to be there just to make getting to Pegasus a bit harder.

Extra point for gorgeous components. I usually don't like plastic bits but even I have to say Cyclades looks great.

Rating respective of the flexibility offered by various expansions, but even the core game is wildly fun and kept me up at night thinking about it when I first played (likely an 8). 
 
Core Game: Turn-order and player-power auction to open every round. Incremental expansion, focus on city-building.

Hades: Incremental expansion with a period of brutal war. A second tier of deities and a fleet of heroes add some additional play elements to both broaden the gameplay and soften some of the more unfair surprise win conditions.

Titans: Goes from naval war to land-war with a secondary mechanic to speed troop moving. This is much closer to a Risk variant than to the original thoughtful game, but it's no worse for the transition.

C3K: Crashes game balance by importing the Kemet creatures and giving them balance breaking powers.

Full reviews on each expansion page. My favorite variant is Hades/Titans + Kemet creatures house-ruled to act as normal single-turn creature purchases (which also saves you from needing the miniatures).

With all the expansions in play the depth of this game is awesome while still playing quickly without too many points of decision paralysis outside of bidding.

Game components are wonderful except the cards, which are too cheap for how much they are handled. The edges on mine started wearing after two plays.

Lost the games through a mistake by me and the other players. Neither of us bought Pegasus and so the player on Appollo could buy it and win the game.

Other than that I like that all players only have 8 armies and fleets. and because of how the game works. I would be impressed that games would take over 150 minutes. (we are pretty good in reaching excessive playing times)

RATING: 8
A multiple victory condition game with a very interesting bidding mechanic. Aside from the Kraken, it's also an incredibly thematic game. Planning ahead is rewarded, but the bidding mechanic and available mythical creatures force you to always have a plan B.
Every single game we played, every player was within one, maximum two moves of victory. It's always so very close, and I love that.
Not a 10 point game though: the fun really decreases when playing with less than 4. The maps hold up just fine, and so do most mechanics, except for the bidding, which becomes much less intense.

For the time commitment there are just other games I would rather play.

RATING: N/A
In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades.

Victory requires respect for all the gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one god, but must pay homage to each of five gods in turn. Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the gods, as only one player can have the favor of each god per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single god per turn.

Played once, 5p.  I absolutely hated this game, and see no reason AT ALL to play again.  At the same time, I can see why others will enjoy the game.  This is really a take on Risk, with a different ability a player can bid on each turn.  But, as with Risk, it will be very common for one player to be completely crushed and essentially out of the game.  And, in a game like this, non-elminiation of players is a bit of a draw back.  My rating is a combination of how much I want to play and how good I think the game is.

Interesting mix of auction mechanics, wargamy feel, and solidly integrated theme.  Don't be mistaken, this is no Risk and there's quite a bit of thinking, reacting and managing.  The brunt of the game revolves around smartly bidding on the God you want, which dictate what you can do in your turn.  Sure there's building and fighting in there, but it's first and foremost a bidding/auction game.  It suffers a bit of rich-get-richer snowball effect and from "take that" / "bash the leader".

RATING: 3
If you like auction/bidding games which are 100% euro style with a theme that makes no sense with the mechanics, then maybe you will like this game. But it's really not my case.

I don't think there is actually something buggy about this game, I just think that it's just boring. First because I hate auctions, Second because it seems like the kind of game where what ever you do, each player will end-up with almost the same score. So why bother playing.

The only surprising thing in this game is that there is no victory points. Surprising for a euro game.

You have a map where you can place and move your people, but that has little impact on the game. In fact in our game, there have not been a single war. Only capturing neutral territories. So the map is somewhat optional. They could have given each player an island board like in Puerto Rico, and the results would have been similar.

For the bidding mechanics, apparently it looks like Amun-Re. Never played that game but it can make you understand the game better.

RATING: 9
It's "Euro-trash" (part Ameri-Trash and part-Euro).  There are Gods to bid favors from and acquire special powers with, Mythic Monsters to call upon, a navy of ships to move, armies to build/conquer with and special buildings to erect.  Lots of opportunity, planning, quick-changing strategies and counter-strategies.  Cyclades is quick and dynamic, things change quickly.  It takes off like a ski-shoot but many times, climatic finishes can end abruptly like driving off a cliff (when you least expect it).  I rather enjoy the ride of this if you like Euro-wargames.

Cyclades is an excellent blend of Euro and Ameritrash. It is original and tense, with excellent production values.

RATING: 8
Cyclades is a fantastic and exciting game. At first glance it looks like a wargame set in a mythological setting, but it is much more than that. It has elements of wargaming, area control but mostly it's an auction/bidding game. To execute certain actions you need to make an offer to a specific God. This is the heart of the game and its the moment where players most often butt heads. An all round great game that plays with a full compliment of players in 60 to 90 minutes. And I hear that the Titans expansion makes this even better. 

Update 10/'15: After having only played four games I'm upping the score to a 9.5. I love this game. Every element works so well together. The final rounds are incredibly tense as all players are scrambling to be the first to build their metropolises. A fantastic game that gets better after every play. 

Update 01/'18: Cyclades is still a great game but it doesn't hit the table all that often anymore. A lot of recent games have done what Cyclades did much better. The bidding mechanisms still make this unique so it'll stay in my collection. Lowered to an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[u]Comments:[/u]
Cyclades is something like a Game of Thrones light, or at least that is how it feels to me. A Dudes On A Map facade is used to hide a bidding and role selection game that has some really interesting things going on. The game is pretty thematic with players taking on the role of Greek city states fighting for dominance in the region. To win the game players must fight off mythical creatures (a very cool element to the game) and each other to build two Metropolis'. The trick is that you can only do one type of thing each tround because bid on the favor of the gods, and only one god will bless you with the favor each round (i.e. Ares gives you troops, and lets you attack other players). The Gods also let you build one of each of the required buildings you need to build a Metropolis. 

Presented with many different paths to victory this game is a mix of Euro and Amerirtrash that pulls off what it sets out to do, and that is simply to be a fun game. 

If you aren't having fun when you are playing and get to say "Release the Kraken" then you don't know how to have fun.

- Everybody was tempted by this game, because it looks very good.

* First game, with 3 players:

- After 8 turns: none of us was very impressed with the game play, so far.  I do not feel any tension.  I don't make so many plans, in part because having only a few gods makes plans longer to execute, and I would be more interested if I could put them into fruition faster.  Maybe I am not spending enough time thinking and strategizing: I tend to lead and animate the game, to the detriment of my investment in it.  Evan is not very focused, which does not helped (he complained about not winning a few auctions, and left the table on 2 or 3 occasions).  However, things are starting to get more interesting, as we can see some of us getting closer to their first metropolis, and also because we are starting to have more significant revenues and, therefore, possibilities.  We also started finding the creatures useful, with the more developed board situation.

- Turns 8-12: The last part of the game was more interesting.  We went through all the creatures.  We used many of them, and it was nice to see what possibilities opened up.  We also started to make invasion plans, etc., thanks to the more crowded board, and to the fact that we were starting to get the hang of the mechanics.  Evan pulled off a victory in a way that we overlooked, because we had forgotten to read the Chimera's special power until the action phase; Evan used it to invade an island with a fortress on it with Pegasus, and he got a metropolis this way.

- Conclusion: after being a little disappointed, I started to like the game.  At first, I felt a little like with Small World: nice, varied bits; simple rules; but not many interesting decisions, because of a relative lack of tension.  Then, we started to make more plans, and to bother each other.  I think we would like the game even better if we all used more time to make plans, instead of leaving the table (Evan), dreaming a little (Jane) or keeping things moving (me).  I suggested this, and this worked (and could have worked better with a greater general involvement).  However, I did miss the interactivity brought about by Settlers, with its constant exchanges (Cosmic Encounter is not bad either at that).

* Second game, with 2 players:

It took us 2 hours to play: in the same time frame, I prefer the wild variety of Magic, the story and streamlined intricacies of Clockwork Wars, the richer combats and situations of A Few Acres of Snow. Maybe this is a good game to keep for more players, though (it even does 5 players): it has the interactive, area control element and miniatures with special powers of Blood Rage (but not the building of a tableau of special powers). But then I have Clockwork Wars for this, or Cry Havoc for 4 people. Maybe this is a game which is in a similar category as Inis, for instance. Maybe my Cry Havoc is good enough for multiplayer combat, though, and better for 2 player? In any case, for 2 players, I prefer to play Hellas: it has a similar combat element, but adds exploration, and more special powers and surprises.

=> I guess I should sell it, I don't see much use for it, except as a diversion from the other, better games. But then I don't play those games with many people often.

We thought this was the best game ever when our group first played it. The theme is great, the components are fantastic, and the game is tense and cleverly designed. Unfortunately this game is often an hour too long, setting up a big play can be an easily interrupted slog, and occasionally the mythical creatures feel to powerful.

I still like it, but it's not the smash hit I thought it was when I first bought it. Maybe the expansion could set things right...

Wow, I've only played this once and only in a 2-player game and I already want to own it. I have a feeling with a few more plays, I might rate it even higher, we'll see. Playing it against my significant other, it was really tough, she made sure I was poor and even stole my priest to outbid me everytime. But eventually she made a tiny mistake which gave me a path to victory which she completely missed by both stealing her philosopher while getting another philosopher from Athena while attacking her with Ares thus giving me two straight metropolis for the win. I'm hoping to play this with more players to see how this game turns out.

I love that game. Bids, fightings, and settings are great.
It is a specific game, so it gets more and more unbalanced the more time you stay in the game, but it is, imho, a decision made on purpose by the designers so that it doesn't last forever (and it's not a short game).
So it can be seen as a positive: you can't play defensively too much in this game. You need to act, else someone else is going to win.

For an auction game this game has mechanics to make it work decently with low numbers. However, attacking seems pretty cumbersome and expensive in this game (not saying there isn't an incentive because it is highly profitable to do so, only that it physically can't happen that often), as you will probably need at least 2 turns to create a string of ships and follow up with moving your armies across to the other island. 

This game seems to suffer a bit from runaway leader though, as despite the monetary bonus from Apollo for being behind if you control more islands, if you are ahead you'll have more income from having more islands, and then you can camp whichever god is first each round to use all the mythological creatures (need some more plays in the higher player counts to see if this is also true for 4-5). Components are very nice and each color has different model sculpts (it's also both fun and profitable to unleash the Kraken). 

I am afraid this game will suffer from replayability issues, as the change in mythological creatures/gods per turn while important doesn't seem to the experience completely different from game to game.

Well designed. Ends a bit abruptly.

RATING: 9.5
The best combination of auction and area control mechanics into a wargame. Also the theme: mythology creates some beautiful artwork. 

The game is very easy to learn because it doesn't have an excessive amount of rules. Basically a player can learn it on the first play.

Because is a wargame it involves strategy but, unlike other wargames a player can't plan the strategy from the beginning, instead players come up with the strategy when they see an opportunity. Also the strategies are not extremely complex so anyone can play this game but there are many ways to win.

Also it has very beautiful game components: 
- the map looks like an exotic wallpaper 
- each player ships and soldiers not only that have different colors but have also different models for each color
- high detailed miniatures specially those five big mythological creatures.
- irregular shaped cardboard coins with two different faces.

Advantages:
- superb combination of auction with area control
- high quality and very good looking game components
- very nice theme
- easy to learn
- works just as well in two player mode as in more than two (different rules in 1 vs 1)
- lots of wining strategies
- very entertaining

Disadvantages:
- some rules are not explained very well (for example when a player discard a mythological creature)
- although it is a good idea to use symbols instead of text to display what a creature does, the symbols are kinda strange.
- those five mythological creatures that are so beautifully shaped are used maxim one round then they go off the board until next time a player buys them (except the kraken which remains on the board). It would have been nicer to stay a little longer even if no player would have benefit from them (like kraken).
- kinda hard to find where to buy the game because it is out of stock ... at least in Europe.

Cyclades is an auction and war based game that revolves acquiring metropolis. These are built through purchasing all the components or by taking them from other players. Each player bids on gods to start the turn and determine the player order for that turn. 

Having played this game several times over the past couple years I have realized that it ends the same way. One person gets too many priests, other players flip table.

Perfect mix between an eurogame and a war game.
It has the tension and thrill of a war game, but luck plays only a minor part on it. The player who best plans will almost always win. Has a good balance between immediate tactics and long term strategy.
Also, another good thing is that you'll never find yourself without of chances of winnning the game, you will always be able to plan a comeback and go for the victory, no matter by how far you're loosing, all you'll need to do is outsmart your rivals.
A excelent game, always willing to play.

Superb auction/war/management games. Components are excellent. Theme is very well rendered. The action selection mecanism using God's auction is very clever and is a "war" in itself.

Pros:
- Easy to teach
- Possible to make a comeback (maybe this is a cons?)
- Management + War!
- scalable between players
- Creatures add a lot of flavor.

Cons:
- You can lead and have the victory stolen to you at the end whena  player snatches 2 metropolises at the same time (personnally I really like this!).

RATING: 8
8.0 after 2 plays.  This is a great "dudes on a map" game with some economic, combat and bidding components.  It is very easy to "turtle" in this game and not fight anyone. However, the people who make big moves will often be rewarded.

The game usually comes down to one person being very close to winning and then everyone will gang up on them to prevent the 1st place person from winning.  Usually through a last ditch effort to stop them at all cost and extend the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cyclades is an odd game. It has you chasing generation of an economy as well as building and collection of discounts. The issue I have is just how "sudden death" our first play was. I'm uncertain that the game could end in any other way without all players involved turtling. 

If the latter were to happen the game would become longer and the entire premise and game play are far too thin to support any length beyond an hour. This game should be fast, dirty, and nasty.

Another play is needed but somehow I think I'll be hard pressed to find opponents.

Well, I'm not awe-struck. Good game and all, but will have to play it some more to really be sure about the rating. It shines with 5 players, 3 and 4 weren't half as enjoyable.

The game suffers from many vague rules regarding the monster cards, and the plastic figurines are the greatest case of over-production I know of.

EDIT 24.10.2015: sold it off. It wasn't seeing too much play in my current group and a recent playthrough reminded me about some of the stuff I didn't like all that much.

Great presentation here and good use of the board for scaling of number of players.

The game seems to have a big problem when someone gets ahead in priest cards which will allow pretty much free reign on the auctions. It starts out as a slight advantage but quickly snowballs into a situation where the other players may as well just let them have it because there is no chance to compete.

This is especially frustrating in the 2 player game. I'm going to reserve full judgement until I try with 4 or more. I'm kind of hopeful it will improve.

2 player game was not particularly competitive; once one side gets the upper hand, its over.  Very dangerous for either player to ignore naval bids early.  Just didn't seem that fun for 2 players.  A relatively good auction mechanic for 2, though.

Didn't do a great deal for me on the first play with 3 players, but it was quite quick.

Second game with 5 players really dig drag a bit, and the endgame was a slightly unsatisfying sneak rush to victory - not a great sign that I didn't really care that I'd won. Biggest issue for me was that none of the decisions I faced felt particularly interesting, because you ultimately have quite limited control over your own destiny. I suppose another way of saying that is there is luck involved, and screwage. Your strategy can easily be undone in an instant by particular cards coming up or by the roll of the dice, which some might enjoy as 'tension' and/or ensuring all players have a chance of victory, but for me just removes the purpose/reward of plotting a long-term strategy. And if a game lasts as long as this one, for me it *needs* deeper strategy than Cyclades can offer.

Assuming players will always seek to deny each other victory where possible, I can see most games ending only when a particular combination of unstoppable god auction order/monster cards comes up, and finally the player who has used in-game positioning or meta-game chat to avoid a bashing can sneak home. As a result it's all a bit 'meh', and there might be an argument for starting with an accelerated setup of some kind just to reach the inevitable endgame scenario more quickly. My suspicion (hope?) is 4 players will be better than 5, purely because it must reduce playing time. Looking around at other comments, it seems we weren't the only ones to suffer massively extended playing time. Also agree with comments elsewhere that some of the creatures are extremely powerful compared with others. Whether you define that as 'broken' or not, not sure.

Best features are probably the different miniature shapes between factions and the monster miniatures, it all looks very nice. Some miniatures seemed fragile though and a number arrived twisted.

Final thought: seems more than the average share of people have put no comment beside high ratings, I wonder if they have just been won over by the theme on a couple of plays and without thinking given it a (large) benefit of the doubt?

Matagot have proven time and again that they know how to produce a gorgeous looking game with great bits and beautiful artwork, and Cyclades is no exception. The sculpted minis can get a bit warped out of the box (the softer plastic breaks less easily, but can be warped over time) but this is fixed easily with the application of some boiling water.

As a game, Cyclades is an interesting blend of Euro mechanics (it is primarily an auction-driven game) with some direct-conflict. The loaded dice mean that combat is never too deterministic, but also that a smaller army will reliably be defeated.

I love how the auction mechanic works. When a player is outbid for a given god's favour, he must choose a different god to bid on - you can't just enter a higher bid. This forces players to think more about how much to offer. Sometimes you'll want to bid high to ensure you get the god you want, sometimes you'll want to bid low in the hopes of being outbid, either to have a chance of seeing what others are up to, or to simply get another chance to bid on a god you were outbid on.

There are many paths to victory in this game, which means that players have to pay close attention - a careless player won't even realise that someone is about to win until they do! This should stand up well to repeated play.

The more I play this game the more I enjoy it. Every choice you make pushes the game towards inevitable conflict. The initial placement of troops puts players into immediate tension. The shared need to take limited actions results in bidding wars. Acquiring buildings or cornucopias strengthens your position, but also makes you a more tantalizing target. I love the design. And Matagot's game production is amazing. The art, board, and miniatures are outstanding. Let me sing the praise of the immense monster figures. And each player color gets different sculpts for the armies and ships! This is a game that is sumptuous on every level.

(10/17)  8. This game feels so strange to me.  First of all, I'm always a sucker for a good auction mechanic and Cyclades is famous for its.  The game play itself feels so sparse that I initially thought there wasn't much game there, but then I realized it's just extremely lean so a game that feels and looks so grandiose really just moves along at a tight clip.  Plus, I love the theme.

I wanted to enjoy Cyclades, but sadly this game seems to suffer from an identity crisis and mechanics that weren’t well tested.

For starters, with experienced players, it can easily go beyond 3 hours because everyone is scheming to block each other from winning.  You aren’t giving much options to win the game and it’s pretty obvious what your next turn is going to be.  Because of this transparency and lack of options, games either bog down to attrition or someone grabs Pegasus.

I’ve tried the Hades expansion, which was garbage, and also the Titans expansion, which improved the game but I felt that they are far better options out there.

Possible trade - need to play it again.

Another fun and well balanced hybrid. What's particularly noteworthy about this is the way in which conflict is used as a threat to drive the play rather than being a factor in and of itself: because you need to spend at least 2 turns lining up an attack it's not hard to prepare a defence of some sort so actual battles are fairly rare. But you still get plenty of interaction & metagame because players have to respond to the *threat* of attack yet the game as a whole stays balanced. Excellent production values and plenty of variety. Big downside is that early quarter of game is quite dull as there's no value in early conflict and all the gods are valuable so auction lacks tension. But it certainly comes alive later on!

RATING: 8.5
Not really a 'dudes on a map' game, but more of an auction with added fighting. The game builds like a house of cards until it all collapses and someone wins. Some may find the end-game anticlimactic, but it's one where you have to watch everyone else like a hawk and I always feel satisfied with how it plays out.

Amazing hybrid game. I was afraid that conflict and interaction would not happen very much, but I was wrong. Sometimes you may decide not go to war but the auction phase provides for plenty of interaction anyway.

Mythic monsters and bidding make this game spontaneously chaotic. Instead of trying hard I recommend to: keep one island throught the entire game, play most of the time Apollo for money and welth horns, collect 4 philosophers (2 times Athena), hunt for Pegasus card and use it wisely. Minimum effort maximum effect :-)

A really good game, plenty of building, and economic development before battle time (unlike Kemet, where battle time is all the time).

A nice blend of Euro and Ameritrash. Possible for massive swings in fortune.

Interesting combination of bidding for actions and player order can result in some gods being highly sought after, with massive bidding rounds depending on the tempo of the game. It isn't all out attack like Kemet.

I had high expectations about this one but, despite its beautiful components and interesting bidding mechanic, the game wasn't exciting to me: mythic creatures aren't as important as they deserve and it seems that actions are too much restrictive for a game of civilizations.

With house rules it is way better - 7.5 even. But the core system was big disappointment.

Pegasus can only transport 1-2 soldiers - without this rule who cares about fleets.

RELEASE THE KRAKEN! Decimating hordes of fleets with the Kraken was one of the most fun moments in gaming, EVAR! What a great game. The artwork is superb, the components are excellent, and the figures are beautiful. It is an awesome blend of Ameritrash, Euro, area control, and an auction game that somehow works! A lot of luck and screwage, so this would not appeal to players who painstakingly plot their strategy to perfection. 'Cause the bottom player will come up from behind, throw some pain your way, sic a Harpy on you, destroy your plan (and armies), and win the game. However, I am fine with luck and screwiness in a fast paced game. (Some games just use luck to their advantage, especially in such a thematic game.)

Once in a while, it's good to play a real "Take That" game.  Cyclade is one of them.  In the early development stage, it surely had the possibility of being an Ameritrash because the feeling is that there is a real "protection" of the losing player.  I liked the choices of actions but I feel like Zeus is maybe a bit too strong an action if the other players don't follow suit.

Another one I liked!

RATING: 7
Combat in slow motion. Trying to figure out just how to perform your invasion in this game is a challenge - as you need to first set up your boats then send in the troops - and with 4 players you can't even be sure if you'll get the god you need from round to round. The result is tension, and a continuous struggle for more money so that you can better leverage the auctions. Ah, yes auctions - a great system of musical chairs with bidding - getting what you want for a reasonable price is tricky and can be dangerous - if you overextend you will be hurting down the line.

The end condition is good, great even, but I also suspect it is the most flawed part of the game and a part that the Titans expansion goes to great lengths to fix. The game relies on players building metropolises - but the only god that automatically drives the game towards this direction is Athena, so if everyone wants to lurk and wait to pounce on other players' metropolises (metropoli?) the game will grind to a halt. There just isn't enough incentive to build and risk it being taken away. 

The result is a good fast paced combat came that allows for cleverness, but is susceptible to becoming a drawn out affair or ending anticlimactically if everyone is not doing their share of "balancing" the game out (ensuring that a winning player can't just grab the one god they need to win).

Game in a Nutshell: Build your cities, while bribing gods, hiring mythological creatures for dastardly deeds, and battling for territory.

Played as: 5 player.

Pros: Includes my favorite type of auction (Amun-Re, Vegas Showdown, etc.) into a game that has some "civ-building", and hostile takeovers. The very limited amount of troops and ships force action and limits turtling. I like that the game allows for very different ways to the winning goal; either peacefully build, or take over the aforementioned buildings through force. Artwork and minis make for a nicely presented experience. 

Cons: The iconography is laughably bad (literally, it can be hilarious), making the included reference sheet an essential game component. The game end seems a bit anticlimactic as win conditions are open, leaders may be ganged up on, results become inevitable, etc. 

Other: My one play of this was LATE on the last night of a convention... who knows what a day-light play might do to my opinion of the game. My guess is that I'd enjoy it more and evolve with additional plays. I wonder how annoying luck would play into the game with less than 5 players when certain roles (maybe necessary to you) are randomly left out each round.

Best Use: A Euro for those who want some in-your-face, and theme slapped on it.

I like auction/bid games because of the interaction.  This one added combat and Greek mythology.  Not a bad combination.  It is wild with 5 players for sure.  Will add to wish list, but not as a high level even though I will rate it decently.  Definitely needs to be played with 4 or 5.  After yet another play, I find it can be unbalanced with how the gods bestow their powers.  Have decided to remove from the wish list.

Cyclades has a fun theme with Greek Gods, monsters and the chrome to support them.  However, when it comes to game play some problems arise.  First off the game seems to reward conservative play.  Once you get ahead, especially if you've built a Metropolis, you have a huge target on your back and your opponents have enough super powers (through the monsters) to quickly set you back.  It seems you don't want to make your big move until you're pretty sure you are going to win.  So instead you increase your economic engine, build up Philosophers (which do nothing for you except help you win the game) and turtle in the middle of the pack.  

After the slow build, once you've saved up enough money, you strike and hope someone doesn't muck up your plans with some crazy monster power.  I like simple fighting systems but unfortunately, in Cyclades, the monsters are rarely part of them so the battles are largely unspectacular.

RATING: 8.5
*July 2013* Liked it. Interesting game, solid gameplay. Only played base game. If I didn't already own Clash of Cultures, I'd probably enjoy this a lot more. It feels like there's more component than game. The auctions are similar to other games as well.

One downside to my rating is the fact that it was my second game and the others' first, so game took much longer than typical. If I could play it in 90 min, it would be a winner.

However, I still need to try it with the Hades expansion, see what fun that adds.

*Aug 2013* After 3 games, I'm finally starting to see the puzzle to unlock. I'm curious to keep at it, maybe play it 5 times base game before hitting up expansion. We'll see, but I'm beginning to see what all the hoopla was about when this was newer and shinier.

After 3 games, I now feel I am beginning to understand it enough to rate it. Initial rating of 8.5 due to simplicity of design and quick play. May go up or down depending on replayability.

Still getting into this game more.  You can see why the expansion added random troop placement as it does seem like some colours have advantages over others with the suggested set up.  Most say that Hades is a must to make this a great game.  I just wish the model monsters you get stuck around on the board longer rather than just that turn.

Cyclades is really at its core an auction game.  The auction mechanic is one of my favs.

As long as it's not taken too seriously, it's a fun and weird little game.

I quite enjoyed the gods, the favors, the cards, the buildings, the goals, and most of the individual aspects of this game. Unfortunately it was the Dudes on a Map portion, and the influences over that, which fell flat for me. The machinations necessary to get the god to move your boats before you can get the god to move your troops to accomplish anything, the limitation of each of those actions to only one player per turn, and the fragility of your plans based on a difficult auction makes the whole thing feel quite limiting, and not in a creative way but in a "wait and watch what happens to me" way. I just can't enjoy it as a complete package. Kemet, while simpler and lacking the more interesting higher-level aspects, is faster and more fun on the ground.

This game is exceptionally high on theme and production values: players play as warriors who bribe gods to get special powers.  The goal is to be the first player to control two of the biggest buildings; there are no victory points, and there's no second place.  

To get the biggest buildings players must either build four of the smaller buildings, get four philosopher cards, or attack another player and take over the building.  

The bidding system is fairly simple: the gods are randomly arranged on a track, and players bid how much gold they will bribe a certain god.  Whenever a player is outbid for a god, they must immediately bid on another god.  This system is interesting, but a bit frustrating, since you can't re-bid on the same god (making it tough to get what you want).

The game is relatively short (about an hour and a half for 4 players), though the rules are complicated enough that they also take a while.  

The game is a bit too random for my tastes: battles are highly random (dice rolls are a huge factor in close battles), and if a player isn't able to get income early in the game, then they're dead (as income is key to everything in the game).  

Overall a fine game, and one with great miniatures, but not stellar.  I'd prefer a straight-up war game or a straight euro.

At it's heart this is a Bidding game with a twist on the auction that when you are outbid you immediately have to make a new bid on a different God... so you have to thing very well before you do your bid on the god that you actually want because if you are outbid there's a high chance that you won't be able to bid on that god again!

It's a very very cool game, liked it a lot and want to try the expansions! It's also a pretty fast game.

Don't remember exactly but it's a biding and economic game, after the first play i like and want more.
I played with the extra tiles instead of the figurines, i enjoyed the biding system but sometimes is a little bit annoying , but i think it's a good and balanced game i will recommend it to other persons who like game with a little military and economic style :)

RATING: 6
Very simple, yet loaded with subtleties that make the overall experience very rewarding. An excellent gateway to more advanced strategy games due to a combination of very good presentation with solid and straightforward mechanics. Highly recommended for players who want to take a shot at more complicated territory control games, but are afraid of the steep learning curve,

EDIT:

Having played the game a number of times, I reckon that most of the time there is not much going on. It's tough to wage war beause only one player can win Ares/Poseidon at a time, and while war is not the only way to win the game, then again the whole experience seems rather slow-paced and tough to control in the long run. Fun as it is, it doesn't even come close to serious strategy / war games.

EDIT: The expansion alleviates most of the issues I used to have with Cyclades and makes the whole experience deeper and aggressive. A very nice expansion indeed.

FINAL EDIT: OK, the expansion made it a good game again, but... There are so many other, better games to play - games that don't drag because of the bidding process and allow you to do what you want and when you want to do it. Thus, Cyclades has had to wave its goodbye after all.

A very attractive game. Lovely graphics and playing pieces. Gameplay is easy to pick up. The theme sits well with the design. It has an auction mechanic, (you bid to win the favours of different ancient Greek gods) and I generally dislike auction games, but I enjoyed this one very much.

El juego gusta, el problema es que cuando mejor rinde es a 5 jugadores y esa es una cifra que cuesta alcanzar.

It looks amazing and colorful, I'll give them that.
However, with only two Gods allowing some movement on the board, you get to spend most of the game sitting and regretting you weren't the one player who gets to move this turn. However, without the chances of moving each turn, the strategic positions of everything get pretty crucial and that's a good thing.
I definitely don't recommend 3-player game, though.

EDIT: The expansions help this game to bloom quite a bit.

I like how this game blends auction style mechanics which is typically a Euro thing with the conquest aspect and minis which feels more Ameritrashy. I really enjoyed the game but it didn't go over super well with my game group. They agreed to give it another try some other time so hopefully they'll come around. Their complaint was once a leader was defined everyone just picked on them - common complain in games but doesn't bother me too much.

I would like to bring this out a little more before i rate it. Its a nice balance between a war game and an EURO (I don't think I got the bidding rule right when I played it). I enjoyed the conflict the game presented as we progressed from zero developments in one island to multiple developments over a few. Should I go for a metropolis or should I build my army? And the gigantic creatures added a nice twist to the gameplay.

Dudes on a map is NOT my bag. This game is okay. I'll usually be willing to play but mostly for the Ancient Greece theme.
Update: my friend bought the Titans expansion, so we've played that a couple times too. It's okay. It adds more things to buy in the shop and a new type of troop. I'd still only really play this game because of the theme and for being my only auction game.

Intense with great theme. Plays fairly quick. I think it's most fun with three or four players, but it is still good with two or five. What I like about this game is that a player can claim victory very quickly. You have to always pay attention and be thinking about what your opponents will try to do with their turn. The bidding is really fun and can get heated with coins being thrown out to get the god that you need.

Cyclades is a really interesting conflict game in that there is a fair dose of Euro in there as well...more than Nexus Ops even.

What separates Cyclades from other modern conflict designs is that various Gods must be bid on in an open auction format (think Amun-Re) and each Greek God offers up specific powers that correlate to combat, economics or construction of key buildings needed to win the game.

What really does it for me though is the wide variety of mythological beasts that can be drawn to your cause. There are lesser and greater beasts and each has a specific power that can be used to further your ends.

The action in Cyclades takes place in an area of ocean dotted by islands. Islands that are controlled can earn income and a base from which to launch attacks but also to build important buildings. 

The game really requires it's players to adapt to changes quickly and those beasts really can throw up major surprises. Strong leaders do need to be double or triple teamed at times to bring them down as having a big income affords a person great power. This concerns me somewhat so further play is required.

Пожалуй, самая конфликтная игра из тех, которые у меня есть. Недолгая, злая игра про грызню за метрополии. Механика совершенно мозговыносящая (не в смысле сложная, а в смысле — извращённая): военно-строительная стратегия, где за каждое действие надо торговаться на аукционе. Плюс, непомерная сила карт мифических существ... И это мне нравится!

RATING: 5.5
I was greatly disappointed with this game. The actions you can perform each turn are based on the God you purchase. If In addition movement and attack with your units is also restrictive based on what god you purchase. By always purchasing the god who allows you to move and attack your units, you can control the game and quite easily win.

The pieces are really cool and it plays fairly different from most games which I like. I really like the look and feel of this game, just disappointed with the brokenness of moving / attacking.

I love this game. The mechanics are very simple, but the strategy is always so tense. I think the bidding mechanic for the favour of the gods is what elevates this game so high.

Hmmm...played my first game, four players, which included the Hades expansion. The two experienced players said ours was an odd game so I'll need to play it again to see if I like it better.  I felt like I couldn't do a damn thing the entire game.  When I finally was able to build some ships, a player wiped out my fleet with a Kraken ensuring another player got a quick victory.  

A few years later, it happened again but with both expansions.  The Kraken wiped out my fleet on the second turn. Then over the next two turns, I lost two of of my three territories.  I needed to roll anything but a zero to win but I rolled zero in both combats (the six sided die has only one zero).  I was out of the game before it even started.

Much like many of Bruno Cathala's other games, this one feels really disjointed. It's not sure whether it wants to be an auction game or a light war game, and as a result it feels like you're playing two games at once. I didn't necessarily dislike the game, but I didn't enjoy myself either. The presentation is quite good, but the fun factor leaves a lot to be desired. If it was just the auction end of things, I think I'd enjoy this a lot more. The conflict/area control just felt really tacked-on and uninteresting.

Out of the civilization games I've played this seems to be the simplest one to learn. Cyclades is actually an auction game in which the players are bidding for the favor of the gods. For example you need the favor of Ares to recruit soldiers and go to war. That makes it very unique compared to other civ games.

In order to win you need to hold a certain number of metropolises. These cost a lot of resources to build. They do offer some defensive advantages, but keep in mind that building a metropolis is painting a target on your forehead so make sure the timing is right before you do it. I've heard that one of the expansions tries to fix this issue by making it more advantageous to build the first metropolis, so I'd like to try that expansion later.

Still a very good game, though. I recommend it, and the Greek mythology theme is a bonus!

I LOVE this game!! Since I was a kid I have always been into Greek mythology and Cyclades is a game which delivers not only such a wonderful theme, it also brings a lot of tactical choices to the table. I especially like the way how your tactics need to be adjusted by the moves of the other players so you constantly need to have an eye on them. Best auction mechanic ever!! Great gameplay, wonderful artwork... Cyclades was, is and will always be a personal favorite!

Good little fast-playing conflict game with some interesting mechanics going on, but suffers from an end game problem: players achieve balance of power quickly, and then it just down to who can pull off the rort for the win.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I really love this game's balance between auction mechanics and conquest/conflict between the players. I feel that this not only belongs in the strategy category, but also the theme category - each of the gods and their effects are very thematic, and it creates a sort of narrative of war between the players and rulers.

I do have some small complaints though - the game can get VERY tug-of-war-y where you get an island or metropolis and you lose it to other players, you get it back, and you lose it again. While I like this, sometimes games can start to get a bit long due to this. I sort of wish there was a built in timer for ending the game (maybe something like don't reshuffle when Chimera comes out and game ends when creature deck runs out and assign points based on islands/GP/buildings/cards controlled if no one has reached 2 Metropolises). I can deal without a timer mechanism but some of my friends have more trouble with the length as it can run into 3 hour long games (on the reverse side, I've finished in 1 hour as well). Another issue I have is Zeus' ability to cycle through monsters indefinitely and Pegasus swinging some games (this can be fixed if you want by limiting Zeus to only 3 or so Monster Lightning Bolts or having Pegasus only able to carry 2 soldiers, but I generally dislike using non-official variants).

I also found the double pillar variants for 3P/4P to be superior to vanilla 3/4P and the Pegasus limitation rule to be better balanced. That combined with the module for variable placement makes this game better but some people I play with don't want to play with different rules, and I am not crazy for variants either. 

Anyway, overall, this game had too many flaws for me to keep overlooking and trying to enjoy. 

In summary, its theme and components are great and its gameplay decent, but the weaknesses of dice combat, Pegasus, extremely long length and other things make this not enjoyable for me anymore.

Plays: 10+

Such a turtle-y, kingmake-y game, terrible how the games turn out. At least in Kemet you can't turtle and its more action back and forth. The auctions aren't even that interesting or tight feeling.

Civilization game, my ass.  The scale is far too small, the mythological elements far too prevalent.  Cyclades is a fight.  Cyclades is a race in which tripping, shoving, and tackling on the way to the finish line are not only legal but positively encouraged.  There are a few very basic upgrades you can buy and a handful of ways you can spend gold.  If this is all it takes to qualify for the civ game category, then half the Euro games in existence meet the criteria.

Cyclades is a fun game that doesn't take too long, has the right amount of stuff going on, and is a sumptuous feast for the eyes.  That's more than enough.  There's no need to pretend it is something that it clearly is not.

Unfortunately, the meat of this game seems to be the bidding mechanism (I would say about 80%) with a little card play on the side (15%) which doesn't make for a very exciting gameplay for a trash/euro hybrid, I have to say. Basically, when bidding is done players left with only some pretty straightforward decisions to make with some "take that!" cardplay thrown in to the mix.

Also, with less than 5 players the bidding is outright annoying when the god you need to do anything worthwhile is just not available.

I need to play this more to get a better feel for it.

Every time I have played it has been great but it always feels anticlimactic and leaves a bit of a bad taste.

This is usually how it goes. I have all these awesome creatures, soldiers, and ships that I'm going to use to rain terror on my puny opponents. With excitement I grab the dice waiting for my next turn only to find that someone built a metropolis and the game is over.

I need more bloodshed!

This game is gorgeous though. Each player has their own unique sculpts for their armies and it looks SO good on the table. 

This is a big reason I have rated it as high as I have. I always have an urge to play it again just so I can eat some ships with the Kraken! Hopefully I can get in some games of this and have a better end experience because everything else this has to offer is fantastic.

One of those games I'm absolutely terrible at but always want to play.  The production and modular board are incredible but the gameplay is really where this game shines.

This is what I wanted AGE OF MYTHOLOGY to be.  Strategic game with both simple naval and land warfare and the use of mythological creatures for many different purposes.  Beautiful artwork and you can see that it was well thought-out when it comes to balance. 

My girlfriend likes it, though she gets miffed when she's successfully attacked.

UPDATE: I have some concerns regarding the Hades expansion.  I like the minor gods and the items, but I wonder if everything together just ups the complexity of the game and what you need to keep track of without actually making it better.  

I need to play it again and see.

UPDATE 2:
Traded it away because I didn't want to play without some cards from the expansion and I didn't want to play with other cards from the expansion.

Basically, the expansion devalued this game for me.

But also, auction mechanics are no longer interesting to me and much less to my girlfriend, and this game was not made for 2 players.

All in all, there are better games for me to spend time on than this one.

Sad, because they were a birthday gift, but gaming tastes change, and this one no longer fit my bill.

I LOVE this game, which is an excellent for opportunistic backstabbers like me! High-quality material and great thematic ambience. Ideal with 4-5 players, but I personally do not recommend for 2 players as you will miss all the diplomatic aspect of the game and just rush the sources of gold. The timeframe is good, with every game we've played lasting between 2 and 3 hours. This game could have been nearly perfect if it had painted mythological miniatures and better used Athena's action (e.g universities currently provide no advantage while it could have given a "Science" card providing an unknown one-time advantage to players).

A light civ/war game. You build armies and boats and send them to take over areas of the board. You get income each round to spend on actions and units. Nothing really that special.

Dinamic game, very well designed with an odd combination of mechanics (euro-trash?).

Great production and components. Seems to have lots of paths to victory, but at the end there's only a couple of ways, and the game can drag too much (this is mostly solved by the expansion Hades).

The Hades expansion is certainly a must if you own this game.

First impression (4 players): I'm not the biggest fan of this type of games with quite a punch of hitting of other players. Cyclades was one of the better games in this genre. Here the game at least cannot stall for too long time and goes on all the time. This is achieved by the fact that every round there will be one token placed that increases someones income (and makes attacking a bit more tempting). Also the victory condition is relatively simple, build (or steal) two metropolises. As you can do Metropolises in two different ways too it's quite flexible. 

So far so good but unfortunately there is something negative too. There are 3 creatures to be purchased during every round and they cost 2/3/4 money but you can get price reduction to them. If you have two of those you can buy whole row for just 4 money and the powers are quite a bit powerful. So it can happen that you get a good god to bribe and on top of this 1 or 2 or even 3 monster powers you can get during some turns. Some other turn there might be much less wanted god and pretty crappy monsters. These swings can be quite big and who gets them is quite a bit determined by luck. Of course you make your luck by not spending too much money on previous round but this is not always possible.

To me personally it is bothering in this type of games that it can be very small things that in the end determine the winner. Here it can be one critical battle at some point during the game that really swings game to someones favour as margins in battles are pretty low.

Movement has to be planned several turns in advance, making the tempo very slow. This also creates too much analysis paralysis in the auction phase. All this slowness combined with the chaos created by the cards does not provide a very fun gaming experience.

The game looks gorgeous, and lots of effort has been spent on the miniatures.

RATING: 7
I think when I play this game more I'll have a higher rating to give this game.

This is an auction, area-control, light war-game.  In Cyclades you take command of a small army and an island or two depending on how many players there are.  Taking islands mean you gain more dosh per cycle.

the game looks complicated, but it is actually very very simple.  Everything is taken in steps and usually there's always something to do or consider.

The first step is to collect revenue for your territories.  Then players auction for the God's favor.  The auction phase ends when all players have a bid on one God each.  Each God grants something, even the free God, Apollo.

On everyone's turn they decide to take an action or recruit depending on which God they gained favor with that turn.  

The objective of the game?  To build 2 Metropolis'.

So what's bad about the game?  Not much really.  The dice can really make you win a battle that looks like you should of won otherwise, but in the theme of tactical warfare one can argue it emulates the risk and rewards of battle.

Each game I've seen won so far has been the first two players who build a Metropolis enter a massive war consisting of 1-3 battles where the victor takes over their opponent's Metropolis and win.  It feels that those who stay quiet and gain an early lead usually dominate the board.

The fights for islands themselves are my favorite part and the theme of the game really comes through when your Greek state annexes opponents.

I played this recently again after quite some while, and have to revise my earlier judgement now. The game is actually very good and offers all the things I expect from a game I should like: it's interactive and thematically sound. Game play inevitably brings along some direct military confrontation, and a close finish. Play time is short but still Cyclades is a lot more than a filler. Also, there is a decent balancing mechanism (Apollo grants 4 gold if the player possesses only one island - BUT it fails with 3 or 2 players!). The rules are light, yet the game still feels comparably deep and challenging. It's far from being a brain burner, however - just a simple and interesting, yet not exhausting board game experience. Last but not least, it looks really beautiful.

What's also cool is that all players usually seem to have good chances for a surprising win. Sneaky victories shouldn't surprise you. 

With only 2 players, early luck determines the winner too quickly, with 3 players, it feels a bit lame. I'd recommend the game with 4 or even better 5.

the gameplay changes in function of the number of player
the system of enchere is very clever and interesting
not so much variety of strategies to win but the better player gains it.
the basic game itself is getting boring fast but i surely recommand the extension hades wich is awesome, i would clearly not play again the basic game alone.
the titan extension is secondary, only if you want to play at 6 or in team

advantages:                                                       disdvantages:
high replay value                                                    need hades extension
the chance is negligible

RATING: 6
Nice art, good auction element, the theme is my favourite (ancient greece setting) but:
-has to be played with the right people (if you hate kingmaking or if you get your feelings hurt easily this game is not for you)
-3 player experience is not good (too few gods and the game drags)
-anticlimatic ending

I liked playing this game, because the auction mechanic is well done, but i had 2 games where I won and felt no sense of achievement, because I didn't deserve to win. One of the players was really smarter than anyone at the table, he was making the right decisions and making twice as much money than others, yet he still lost. Everyone turned on him with the mythical creatures (which are really inbalanced - infamous pegasus) and that gave me an opening for easy win (which I regreted almost seconds after the decision). For me the reason it suffers is because you need to accumulate only 2 vp (albeit 1 vp consists of several steps/parts) and there is no elimination (with a weird catch-up mechanism) and sporadic, yet very decisive conflict. Now, I generally  despise player elimination and like to avoid conflict, so I could just build and defend my empire, right? Wrong. It does not work in this game, simply because how impactful the combat could be. 
Every game I played went something like this: players build their empires, colonise islands and are roughly on the same level. After some time (1.5-2 hours) almost everybody has at least 1 metropolis (vp) and is either close to finishing second (2-3 turns from it) or has large enough military close to one of his opponents, that he can take it by force (with some luck or help of mythical creatures). Once everybody realizes this, the mayham begins and everybody tries to get the final point and the victory is usually granted to the one with the most luck in combat, or the player that for some reason was not attacked. It is all so sudden and random and undeserving and more often than not happens, that the player who was the best during the whole game gets attacked by everybody and somebody mediocre pulls of a victory by chance.
There is just too much chaos going on to feel that Your decisions matter and the turns feel slow (You cannot chain movements very efficiently).
It is simply a weird mix. I think I would have liked it more, if it were a pure euro, or even if it was a pure wargame. Even though I don't like conflict I feel that I would have liked this game more if it had more of it (It would have at least felt that You were fighting for survival, not just being unlucky in one battle that You had during one session)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great gateway game with the larger player counts (prone to kingmaking ending). For more experienced gamers, the 2-player setup is more tight and highly recommended. In those cases, play to 2 metropolises only (luck plays a larger part, but the game does not overstay its welcome).

Amazing production values.

RATING: 3
Middleweight economic auction euro/war hybrid. Auctions are like Evo, Amun Re, Vegas Showdown etc.

Feels a lot like Antike, both thematically and in that it's seemingly easy to get within striking distance of winning, but difficult to finish the job - especially when you realise that some of the monster cards can seriously mess you up, and people can burn through the deck looking for just that. Pay attention to the monsters. 

Edit: After a few plays the pattern is that the endgame will come down to one of the non-leading players having to buy their way through the monster deck, hoping to draw one of a small number of cards that will stop the player who is about to win. As such the game largely comes down to luck of the draw, (not interesting), and furthermore problematic because if A burns their resources to stop B then player C who has not paid this cost can go on to win.

Would be improved by Antike style combat system.

If you're reduced to 1 island you are invincible. You can keep taking the extra income tokens, build up a massive income, build a metropolis, build a land army then use you cash reserves to cycle through the deck looking for the one that teleports your troops.

I really don't like the endgame of Cyclades - every game it comes down to paying to dig through the deck for one or two particular cards. Maybe they are at the top, maybe they are at the bottom - it might as well be one big dice roll.:yuk:

There is far too much luck for me to find this game interesting. The normal combat is also luck based (I'd prefer if it was Antike/Imperial style), but that's peanuts compared to the endgame. :zombie:

Also, most games, some players are forced to bid up things they have little to no use for just to stop so-and-so from getting it, but then they are crippled for next turn when a third party gets the benefit.:soblue:

Final gripe: hidden but trackable information.:yuk:

Was looking to get a game of this in for a while, and it did not disappoint.  The game looks absolutely great.  The extremely limited number of units keeps the game moving since there is no way to build up massive amounts of armies.  I did not love it as a four player game, but it was still fun for a race game.  This game seems like it would be really good with 2.

Each round starts with an Amun-Re type auction for the 4 available actions (or skip out to get more money). Each of the actions allow you to build a different coloured building. Get one of each of those and you're halfway to winning, as you get to build a metropolis on one of your islands, and 2 wins it. One of the actions allow you to buy white cards. Get 4 of those and that's another way to build a metropolis. Or use the ship action to build up your ships, move them so as to create a convoy link between your island and someone elses, then use the army action to build armies and go take over someone else's island after some dice combat. Take over another already built metropolis and that's you're third way to getting there. With only one attack per turn, things aren't too chaotic, but each turn someone has that power and something will be happening. So it's a game of ensuring money supply, winning bids cheaply, planning any conquest a turn or more ahead with care, watching what everyone else is doing and being mindful of how each person is planning to get their second metropolis and acting earlier than the last minute to stop it. These are the things you're thinking through, but turns are pretty quick. The game is enjoyable enough, in that "everyone will be closing to winning, who am I going to stop" kind of way.

It's got a lot of simple elements that give you many strategic options when combined.  My friend described it as "simple and complex" which is oddly accurate.  Attacking is simple.  Bidding is simple.  The God abilities are simple.  The mythic creature abilities are simple.  Winning is straight-forward (build 2 metropolises to win).  But you add them all together and it's easy to learn but tough to master because, every round, you have to be aware of many possible winning moves and block opponents while progressing yourself.

Gran juego, de los mejores que he probado nunca. Confieso que sólo hemos echado un par de partidas, pero la impresión que nos ha dejado a todos es genial.

Las reglas son relativamente sencillas, pero muy elegantes. Combinan ciertos elementos simples que aportan mucha profundidad y variedad a las partidas. Además, esa mecánica bien conseguida se combina perfectamente con el tema central del juego: polis griegas enfrentándose por el dominio de un archipiélago, buscando el favor de los diferentes y caprichosos dioses y sujetos al poder, a veces incrontolable, de criaturas y monstruos clásicos de la mitología helénica.

Una de las cosas que más me gustan del juego es que siempre da oportunidades a los jugadores que parece que se van descolgando de la carrera a la victoria, incluso permitiéndoles remontar y tener opciones de ganar al final.

Estoy a falta de probarlo con la extensión Titans, que parece que es capaz de mejorar la versión básica juego. Y eso, la verdad, promete mucho.

Recomendable 100%

Really enjoying this one. A fun, constantly different "guys on a map" game, with "Euro- flavor" that plays in 60-90 minutes and scales well at all player counts.

Due to the Gods, and Mythological creatures, there is a lot of opportunities in this game for sudden large swings. You really need to be paying attention in this game.

Not as much conflict as one would think, in this game. I've played entire games with 5P and seen only 2 battles.

Great components. Semi permanent creatures minis, once painted up, really helps the visual appeal.

The bidding mechanic is fun, the mythological creatures add a lot of flavour and the theme is very strong.

One of the things that i like about this game is that it is very well balanced, it's very hard to get your second metropolis and one bad move can make someone else get theirs!

A warning though, this is not a war game, even if there's a little battle here and there, the real battles are done with coins on the gods board.

A fun game of battles and territory control. You try and hold islands in order to build larger building on them, but the board is small and thus you cannot simply coward in a corner although if you can go unnoticed it would be advantageous. You also bid on gods yet only one player get win the bid on each god and since each one gives a specific benefit, you need to plan or save money to be able to do what you want. Worth a try, fast paced and battles are a must.

This is a multi-player wargame in which each turn begins with an Amun-Re-style auction to determine what types of actions the players will get to execute on their turn.  The goal isn't solely about conquering; the first player to build up two of their territories to metropolises (or take over metropolises belonging to opponents) will win.  Because of the limited actions, only one player will get to attack each turn, which is an interesting feature.  In any case, I thought this was a well-designed game, but I don't really enjoy multi-player wargames, which is why my rating isn't higher.

I've only played twice so far, but here is my two cents:

-Great production Value
-A nice blend of Ameritrash with Euro gamer style
-Easy to pick up but not shallow


Success in the game will be primarily determined by your ability to bid on the right god at the right time. Being able to predict (and manipulate) your opponents behaviours will give you the upper hand. 

There is an element of luck in the game that will keep you on your toes. The dice differentials are very low so its unlikely this will make or break a well thought out strategy.

The cards can put a twist on things but accounting for this risk is part of the strategy as well. 

I recommend this game for those that bore with the mathematical steps of a game like Puerto Rico, but need more strategy and less luck from a game like Settlers of Catan. As a bonus the game looks fantastic, the pieces are well constructed, and the playing time is reasonable - enough to feel you've executed a complete strategy, but not so much that your slogging it out for hours.

RATING: 8.2
A hybrid auction game. The auction at the beginning of the round is the heart of the game, with a bit of expansion, miniatures and combat/dice rolling to appeal to ameritrash-lovers, as well. Plays best with 5, but can take very long! If you love tension up to the last round, you'll get this experience from Cyclades.

RATING: 7
Very interesting action-bidding system. Offers a lot of options and a lot of tension. The rest of the game is simple enough to keep it light. Only downside is the game end: as soon as somebody is close to winning, the other players can block certain actions, drawing out the game and eventually it can be kind of lucky who wins.

If you play Cyclades mainly as a euro you’ll probably lose. Yes, the bidding and the building aspects are important, but if you neglect fighting, positioning and drafting of mythological creature too much you’re in for a though time. Especially the creatures with their various special powers are far more important than one might suspect the first time playing, you got to make the most of the creatures really..

A single coincident can lead to a quick victory in Cyclades. It’s crucial to make the most of your turn – what can you do and what can you prevent other players from having? Timing is of essence in Cyclades and doing that move for victory is often a risk, exposing your self if failing. One bad move could ruin your chances of winning.

The rules are only – and just barely – medium complex, but I think Cyclades could be a hard game to master.

Two 4-player games so far..

Juego muy bueno, con mucha interacción, batallas, subastas y muy muy bonito en mesa. Top 3. Lo mejor de todo es que hasta el último suspiro cualquier jugador puede ganar....

RATING: 7.5
This game is a perfect mix of Euro and Ameri game.  There are a lot of tough decisions involved with the bidding, spending, and actions.  You'll always have to plan ahead to as one cannot move ships and land on the same turn.

The titan/creature cards are nice, however sometimes have too big of a swing in the game.

RATING: 4.5
Auction grafted onto the side of a war/area control game ends up being like a foot grafted onto your forehead - incredibly out of place and not very useful. People immediately being able to change their bid after someone outbids them leads to interminable outbidding chains. Granted: I played this 2P and it seems like more than 2P would be far better. 2P it's just not good at all.

Głównym elementem gry jest licytacja oraz umiejętne wykorzystanie zdolności oferowanych przez bogów.
Schemat rundy i gry jest prosty, licytujemy wpływy u bogów, każdy wykonuje akcje związane z bogiem, którego przychylność wylicytował. Nie można dać się zwieść prostocie rozgrywki, jest do bardzo głęboka gra, gdzie umiejętność licytacji, planowania, zastawiania nieprzewidzianych pułapek jest znacząca.
Pięknie wydana, nie nudzi się. Zajmuje około 90 minut, więc też nie nuży. Pod koniec każdej rozgrywki emocje sięgają zenitu.

1/11/12 - I played this with 5 players recently and it was amazing. The auction mechanic combined with the ability to attack and build cities is an amazing combination. The components are beautiful and each color has different looking troops and ships. The artwork is also breathtaking. The game flows really well and I really enjoy it.

7/15/12 - This is my absolute favorite game. The choices and strategy of the game are really fun. You have to decide if you want to attack, if you want to move, if you want to build towards your metropolis, if you want to be first player to cycle through the cards, if you want to purchase help from the mythic deck, if you want to collect priests to help you in later rounds, if you need to block someone from attacking you, if you need to bid high on someone you don't need but someone else does so you can force them to spend extra money, how to get your resources, and how much you are willing to pay for all this. It's super fun and I can't wait to get the Hades expansion.

3/11/13 - Played again after a long time of sitting on the shelf and I really like it. Maybe it's because I won, I don't know. The game is really good but sometimes it's hard to coordinate attacks and ship movement for newer players.

Secret Santa FTW! I’ve really enjoyed my 3 plays of Cyclades. Bidding on the gods to grant actions and special powers makes for many tense moments in the game. There seem to be multiple viable strategies and I’ve already seen some surprise moves lead to an unexpected victory. I worry a bit that the game could stalemate and drag near the end, particularly because there is no built-in timer in the game. However, I haven’t seen that happen yet, and I’m looking forward to playing this much more. 

Thanks again, Santa!

This is a great game, and it's quite unique as well. It combines auctions with "dudes on a map" empire building and expansion. Game play is tense. Plays best with more players. Another nice thing is that it can be forgiving -- so if you make a mistake, you can recover.

I recently got back into board gaming and really enjoy this.  I'm still into it after 6 plays and that is saying a lot. The theme and mechanics come together nicely.  Beautiful components. Lots of strategy and paths to victory.  Simple enough to play with family.  Short enough to play in the evening after work.  Great with 3-5 players, not too good with 2. 4 seems best. 
Negatives: monsters are pretty unequal (some suck and some are broken) and it seems like this could easily have been fixed.  Monsters with minis should stay in play.
Update: Played a lot, and it is hard to figure out the algorithm for a solid strategy and I'm not sure there is one.  The player in second place almost always wins.

RATING: 10
Perfect, concise military game with auction mechanics, special powers, and heated battles. On the surface, it seems like a strange mix of ideas, but it incorporates them into a fast, enjoyable game where tactics are valued over brawn. Never slow, always tense, about everything you could ask for in a game like this.

Edit: I think I've played this 4 times and it has an interesting "take down the leader" element to it, since the winning stroke can be won in 1-2 expertly executed rounds. So piling on the leader is common. That often leads to the 2nd place guy taking the lead, causing another pile on. Yet it somehow doesn't feel random or unnecessary. It all works and is never dull.

Really amazing game that flows naturally from the bidding for the Gods favors. The actual maneuvering is pretty straightforward, so it is all based on maximizing your area of influence, that is, concentrating on being good at something others aren't. As mentioned in some forums, turtling does work, but sometimes it is not an option to do different. The creatures do break that balance  pretty well and are the biggest swing factor. Managing your money expenditure wisely is really what drives your victory.

This game is fantastic. I have always been a huge fan of Grecian mythology. I like how the auction is done to seek the favor of a god rather than strictly a money auction that gets you something of value. Games always tend to be tight with most people being able to win at any time in the last few turns.

RATING: 7
Beautiful game. There's a lot of tense building up and bidding, feeling that at any time someone with a lot of money or the right monster-card can completely screw you over.

You don't have much control or defense, so it can be hard to make the right decisions. That can lead to a quick game with a lot of back and forth, or a slow ponderous game where everyone takes their time figuring out what the right amount to bid is and whether you can let the other player have this or that god.

Our first play was of the slow and ponderous kind, and at the end of the game I didn't feel like I had really done very much, but I have the feeling that if you play quickly and are willing to take some risks this can be an awesome build-and-fight game that can be played in a single evening, and there aren't many of those, especially not with a beautiful look and great miniatures like Cyclades.

The game is a quick playing Civilization type game. Build up is slow but the game will end in a very reasonable amount of time. Each time I play, I enjoy the game even more. There are a variety of strategies to try but, as with any war game (lite or heavy) one must watch and react to the strategies of one's opponents. If you try to play this as group solitaire you will lose. Every move will have repercussions. A very enjoyable experience.

In general I enjoy games where you have military figures on the board so long as they don't get too fiddily and so long as meaningful combat isn't too random. 

In this game, you have to win the bid to worship the right god in order to take the action(s) associated with that god. The expansion adds a new god, hades, who covers up one of the god spots randomly, meaning the same actions aren't always available every turn. It's really fascinating and it sings with exactly 5. 

The minis are also really cool, even if they are a little pointless, as most of them have one-use effects and then vanish from the board. There can be situations where you get knocked out of a region by your opponent and you are unable to retake it just by virtue of not being able to win the bid for the move action. 

It's a double edged sword, as it is both part of the strategy and part of the frustration. Thankfully you can also win by getting a certain number of this one specific card, so you can try to switch gears for awhile if you start finding yourself outmatched militarily.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent game.  The miniatures make it seem like it is going to be Ameritrash and wall-to-wall combat (which a pretty tough sell in my group), but it really isn't.  It's a fascinating auction/area control type game with a bit of combat that is largely incidental, and probably could have been taken out of the game entirely.  
A complaint or two: the mini's are tiny, fragile, and kind of silly.  I think, if this becomes something we play more, I'll just get the wooden pieces.  Also, it is pretty heavy on the symbology.  Not a huge deal, but can be intimidating for some gamers who don't want a lot to memorize.  My group was not very excited to play this game at all while I was setting it up...eye rolls galore...but...
Once we got playing, it was fun.  Like real, visceral, engaging fun.  The auctions were loaded with cursing and laughing and dire proclamations of future revenge.  The best kind of reaction you can hope for in a game: emotional.  And as we moved our little men from island to island, circling the weaker civilizations, eyeing which monsters we could use to help defend or attack our neighbors, I was struck by how exciting and suspenseful the game was.  
Cyclades is a triumph for gaming.  Highly, highly recommend.

I think this is a really smart game that doesn't seem to have the recognition I think it deserves. Very few I have talked to seem to have heard of this weird blend of Ameritrash and Euro. I enjoy playing this when I can get people interested in doing so. Have heard Kemet is basically a better version of this game, and would love to play but have never gotten the chance to do so yet. Still, the bidding for the gods mechanic is really well done in my mind. I do however only think this should be played 4-5, as the 2-3 player options I just don't find very fun with the way the gods come up turn to turn.

Sept 2017: Better than expected! I'm lukewarm on dudes-on-a-map game as they tend to be too convoluted as a result of trying to be different than all the rest.

Very straightforward, perhaps a bit simplistic game play. I really like the straightforward objectives (just build two cities). The tech tree is quite simplified. Yes, there are lots of special powers, but most of them are used only once. 

What surprised me the most was the auction mechanism taken from [gameid=1159], which I found to work better in this game as (a) money is tighter so the auctions don't go on forever, and the things being auctioned off are actual actions and turn order -- the things have more of an impact on the game than the dinosaur parts in Evo.

A multiplayer "waro" that doesn't make the player a hostage of the will of the others at the table. Fast setup, fast rounds and you can finish a light (but never shallow) 5-players civ game in under 2 hours. Marvelous art. And with just the right ammount of randomness. The designer got several elements right, like how the bidding works, the randomly available gods (actions), the low spread of the combat dice, the themed flavour of the creature deck, the reasonable compensation rules (Apollo and the one-island rule), the non-VP victory condition and the almost abscence of player elimination. A master class in modern boardgame design.

Great game with good game mechanics, an interesting and different experience that offers plenty of strategy and some bluffing mechanics too with betting on your offerings to the gods. 

I enjoy the theme of greek mythology, sadly the player miniatures are rather fragile but it is a plus that each color has a different miniature for it and a different boat model. It adds more character and I imagine it will be very helpful to colorblind players. 

I do however recommend getting the Hades expansion to allow a bit more offensive play since right now it is a bit low on options for conflict and that can make the game a bit longer.

Fun Ameritrash game.

1) Bid to get armies, ships, or cards.
2) buy the help of mythical creatures
3) attack other players to take over their islands
4) construct buildings to get benefits and to eventually win the game when you build 2 metropolis'

RATING: 7.5
Players represent one of the 5 major cities vying for control before ancient Greece had been consolidated as one state. Auctioning for role selection is central to this game, and how players get gold, assemble armies and fleets, move them, and build the 4 building types required to create a metropolis. It is also how to select the use of one of the three mythical creatures that can act as game changers, thwarting the best laid plans of other players. You must keep a close eye on each other, as the game plays quickly and the first with two metropolises will win. Combat is simple, and dice based. The game, early on, is one of building and fortifying your base, while preparing your strategy. The artwork is stunning, with simply one of the best box covers ever.

FUN FAST MULTI PLAYER MYTHOLOGICAL LIGHT CIV BUILDING AND CONQUEST GAME
After two 5-P plays with my family I declare this to be an excellent family game.  The first play was slow as everyone absorbed the reasonably simple rule set.  The second game buzzed along quite quickly.  I was setting myself up for a win on the next turn when my youngest (9 YO) announced victory - there was one more player to go that turn but big sister could not avert little bro's victory.  There are a lot of things to think about and yuou need to watch the other players.  The 5-P game uis a hoot, I suspect 4-P will be just as good or better.  The mthological creatures seem like they will maintain variety of play.  My initial impression is that this is a truly top notch light-middleweight game.

Have played three more time with my gaming group.  The last two plays were 4P knock down dragouts that lasted 3-4 hours each.  Two factors for long game length.  First -smart competitive players ready to knock out the leader, often via wicked bidding wars,  Second in 4P game one god always missing, often Ares or Poseidon, resulting in multi turn set ups for critical attackes.  Ultimate compliment from the moat Euro-ish guy in the group, despite game lasting from 8:00 to 11:30 PM = it did not seem long at all, totally immersed for every minute.

mechanics such as bidding, battling, and area control make this easy to learn brain burning game excellent.  Awesome theme on top.  uniquely works well with two thru 5 since there are multiple boards.  best new game I've played in a while.   This seems like it would appeal to both wargames and eurogames because it brings in mechanic of both but neither overpowers the others.

Have only tried with 2 players so far and was a close game. I thought for sure several times that I had lost earlier in the game but I came back and we both had a chance to win on the same turn.

RATING: 7.51
Light competitive game. In each turn the players bid to take on different roles. The roles allow them to conduct certain actions, building cities, gathering or moving armies, assembling philosophers or priests. These things allow players to create metropoli, or to capture them from other players. When one player captures two they win the game.
The bidding mechanism, role selection, and manner in which navies transport armies, are all clever little mechanics that present a challenge. Though all of them are borrowed from different games the way they are assembled is quite interesting.
The game has, as many Euro style games do, a rather sharp end-game. It kicks in rather suddenly, bringing the game to a rapid end without much opportunity for fortunes to swing back and forth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting merger of a Euro-style auction mechanic with moving armies about the board and fighting by rolling dice. I think it's a good game - it looks absolutely beautiful too - but these days I rarely find myself wanting to play it. The various different mythological creatures keep each game different - but Pegasus is overpowered (not game-breakingly so, but definitely in the sense that even a first-time player needs to be told that it exists so that they can plan for it). The rules, which do a good job on most things, also do a woefully inadequate job of explaining exactly how the creatures work (there is a separate reference sheet with all of them on, but it is far too sketchy), meaning that either a quick decision on how to interpret them, or looking up rules questions on BGG, is necessary.

It's still an excellent game, though - just not one that's often on my "I want to play this tonight" list. In fact, we haven't played it since at least 2013, and I can't say I'm in a rush to play again.

I love conflict games, so this one with the greek theme caught my eye right off. also, the game bits are darn cool and can really make the game look beautiful.

I have only one game under my belt, but the trifecta of bidding, income, and combat make a for a fast and intense game. the creature can cause huge swings in the game so be warned.

Played a full 5 players and I was disappointed with the amount of combat and interaction in the game. All the components and mechanics work well, but you just never needed to invade anybody to win. Big minus in my book.

rating after 1 play - 6/7 5pl

disappointed with this one - promised so much at the start (and i concede it MAY improve with more plays as u learn what is and isnt important - like for instance its more about earning money to spend on monsters than actually attacking people - nb NOT a good thing ^^)
as the designer himself said: 

"It's a game of money management... with some fights"

BUT whatever cos ultimately it's just too random.

the game design is such that in the last round a number of players will be able to win and its down to 1 coin here and there and which monster comes up which leads to the biggest complaint - the sodding monsters

NB looks like we played a couple of key rules wrong which may change things so i will put of a rating till next time..

I abused the hell out of the special powers and creature opportunities to win this game.  I should feel pretty good about that, but somehow I don't.  Direct conflict just isn't my thing, even when I'm the bully.
This game has both auctions and battles, which both really benefit from the maximum number of players a game supports.  I feel like the game I played probably suffered from only having 3 people playing.

It is an economic game with a light take-that element.  Game seems nicely designed to play in the allotted 60~90 minutes as there are multiple paths towards the game's ultimate goal of getting a couple of metropolises.  And victory seems to come quickly and suddenly.  Of course with practice and knowledge of the various production loops in the game, that might be mitigated.  I like how the game adjusts the powerful gods by number of players in addition to the board.  Easy to teach (once you get through the various icons) and fun to play.

05-06-2014. Rated after one play. I like this game a lot. Cyclades is often compared to KEMET, which I own. In contrast with Kemet, attacking is more expensive and less rewarded in Cyclades making the game more tactical and less opportunistic. 

Combat itself is not extremely tense in Cyclades, just number of guys + die roll. Kemet has great card-driven combat system, which allows for some neat tricks. 

What for me is a big improvement of Cyclades over Kemet, is that Kemet has a poorer action selection mechanism in which everyone selects 5 actions in turn and competes for special abilities. The tension is Kemet is not in the worker placement, but in the combat.

In Cyclades in contrast, there are 5 actions available that are auctioned off, making it very tense because if you do not get Ares, you cannot attack. If you do not get Poseidon, you cannot build or move ships. 

This is were Cyclades really shines, although I think both games are different enough to warrant purchase. Also, there is a neat expansion available which allows you to mix both games.

Amazing game!  Looks like a wargame, but it's really not - there's more the threat of potential attack than much attacking, and the mythical monsters add enough surprise so you're never sure if you have a secure defense.  Turns go really fast, and while it can take a little time to figure out how high you can bid in the auction, the calculation is much faster than say Power Grid.  This will probably Jones theory Vegas Showdown for me - quite similar in terms of the auctions, but more interesting interaction in terms of the game board dynamics and in vying for turn order.

Update: Lowered from 8.5 to 7.5 - while fun, there are some weird interactions that can come up that decrease the fun factor for me.  The auctions are much more about guessing how much your opponent is willing to bid and then starting that bid at or above that - there is often very little outbidding, especially at 3 players.  I would actually recommend avoiding this with 3 players.  Still good but not itching to play it like before.

--Sep2010-- More amusing than I'd expected.  The balance of militaristic and economic activities are (at least in my irrelevant opinion) very well nuanced; neither component of the game seems at all subordinate to the other.

The jury is still out on this one, at least until I get one more play in.
 It seems there is a pretty compelling game here...  This is not a wargame, though I think most people will look at the map and their piece strewn across it and think that they must make it one...  If one or 2 players commits to this, the game can drag as there is a point where the players competing for a victory with metropolis can be stymied by player bent on keeping them from the choices the need to make.

A game of ancient mythology where players bid for the Gods to gain favors (actions). The theme works very well and the limited amount of actions make the game tight.

The special cards add enough flavor, randomness and theme to the game.

I don't see anybody talking about this game anymore; it seems to have been overshadowed by Kemet.  Kemet may be a better game, but I feel they should really be so directly compared as they often are; Cyclades' auction-based action selection makes it really unique.  Some people may be put off by the fact that only one person each round may attack, while only one may move ships, etc., and the abruptness of the game end.  Others, however, will love the feeling that no player is really going to have a runaway lead in this game, due to the fact that victory always seems to be a few unchecked moves away for everyone once the game has gotten going.

This game has beautiful (and unnecessary; there's some great stuff even on the backs of board segments) art.

It came very highly rated, and I'm a huge fan of Euro-Ameritrash hybrids like Chaos in the Old World, so I bought it without having played it. It really fell flat for us. The central auction for the gods is really punishing and restrictive due to its deep reliance on the one-two punch of Poseidon followed by Ares, leading to a tedious, grindy game of waiting for the opportunity to actually do something interesting every few turns.  The Titans expansion, however, fixes this by redesigning the board layout and adding Kronos who lets you recruit Titans that can move your army on future turns no matter what god you just won.

A great game. Good mix of euro mechanics and ameri interaction and sensible winning condition (no VPs!). One of the best battle resolution mechanism, which while extremely simple, makes luck firmly secondary to skill. Finally, best catch-up mechanic I've seen, making you fight till the end as you [b]always[/b] have reasonable chances of victory, at least with four or five players. Its maybe even too strong - if you're attacked early and limited to one island in a game of four or more players, you're paradoxically on a good way to victory.

Why not a higher rating? Nowadays I play mostly euros, or at least more complex games.  I will still pull this out within a heartbeat if confronted with less experienced players, though - it's a perfect gateway for conflict oriented groups.

Turns fly by and there's a decent level of control as you juggle turn order with bidding goals and mythological creature purchases. Of course at the end it degenerates into a bit of a whacking game (bringing back the perceived leader and making a push for the win0, but it's all within acceptable levels of control - because (apart from creature cards), there's only one way to whack ships and one way to whack islands, so those who have the funds to bid and play defending bids have earned it.

It's light and easy to learn and teach. I certainly prefer it over Kemet. The Amun Re bidding system works great. Not a bad addition to any collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Light multiplayer wargame in which the most important part is the bid used to asignate the different actions available, from building your army or navy and attacking, to constructing temples and recruiting priests or philosophers.  It is a game where players don't grow to win, but where they arrange the conditions to make a final master play to achieve victory.  So, it is a game that players don't win, but unespectably steal the victory in just a play before the incredulous eyes of their rivals.

I absolutely love this game. The Greek theme is outstanding and even when you're losing it's an entertaining game - because you're losing ships to a Kraken rampaging around the sea or a Minotaur guarding an island. The models really raise the game up a level, I feel. The bidding phase is also excellently done, especially as each player's gold total is kept secret. There's a real element of tension and prediction to it. I'm not sure yet whether or not I consider it an issue that invasions tend to be easily foreseeable logistical nightmares; on the one hand it's nice not to have someone randomly spring an attack on you and relieve you of your island, but on the other it means you can't really surprise the other players. The expansion fixes this though!

Everything about this game is well-made and beautiful. Game play is very interactive, with high player conflict. I like much of what the game does, but there's no real story arc - it's end game from turn 2 or 3. It turns into a game of constant leader bashing that ends when someone uses the Pegasus to pull out the victory.

I enjoy this game, but it has a weird endgame. It feels like once there is one metropolis, all of the players that are doing well are within one turn of winning the game (if no one else interferes). A large part of the game revolves around forcing through your critical bids, and preventing people from getting Ares when they are planning to attack you or win the game.

We got this game in a trade after we had played and loved Kemet and I must say that this game deserves the high praise it has received. The theme is rich, the mechanics and design are intriguing and keep you on your toes, the gameplay is easy to grasp, it plays pretty fast and offers a great experience.

I love the mixture of euro game and ameritrash game.  The level of conflict in this game is right up my alley.  I also love how there seem to be multiple ways to go about winning.  For me this is an absolutely incredible game.  My wife was not to big on it though.  Fortunately, we were able to trade it easily for a game we both like.  So it all worked out .

Gra ma wszystko co bardzo lubię: tematyka mitologiczna, figurki, ładny art. Teoretycznie powinienem być zachwycony. Niestety rozgrywka jest dość płytka, nie ma emocji. Niezależnie czy skupiamy się na rozwoju budynków czy walce to gra niestety nie porywa. Możemy też rzucić się na przeciwnika i mieć pecha w walce, w której do ilości jednostek dodajemy wynik rzutu kostką o wartości 0-3. Pech może zadecydować o losie całej dalszej rozgrywki i nie mamy na to wpływu.

Don't quite get why the Amun-Re bidding mechanism had to be ported here, and it feels like unnecessary tacked-on clunkiness. In fact, the whole game feels clunky, with warfare seeming like a byproduct of auctions and timing the spending of your money to coincide with the best god in seat 1 with the best monsters. And this 'build-up' is done in a lot more interesting ways in other games.

The theme and pieces make for great fun factor though. And this is one of those rare games that plays well with 5.

This game is made excellent with the expansion. More options for conflict and more variety, both addressing the main complaints I have with the base game. The setup is also player-balanced to address another complaint, which I didn't mind.

I haven't played base game Cyclades for a while as the group I'm playing such games with combined it with Hades expansion. Until after half a year or so I decided I was fed up with it and refused to play it anymore. It's hard to say if the problems I've had with it were group related (groupthink) or expansion related - I can for time being believe some groups having no problems with it, however if a group has certain approach the Hades expansion makes it much more pronounced.

Problems of Hades: Basically Hades allows for more attacking options (yes, people cried, we want more DoaM action) and it gives heroes and stuff and more stuff. Problem is all these things go in tangent to what pushes the game forward. The game finishes when somebody controls 2 metropolises - more attacking makes it easier to take them over. But who is going to build them? Ehm. Yeah. Heroes seem cool, but they cost upkeep and that's money which will not go into what builds a metropolis. Sure most heroes have a special power that makes it easier to build a metropolis, but given their cost I'd say it doesn't pay off the money and effort put into them. And they do another thing: with upkeep they ask for steady income, so players are focusing more on getting territory and trade routes to build an economic base, neither of which pushes the game towards conclusion. Those special cards and whatnot are just stuff for sake of stuff hence distraction. Then we get to Hades. What seems cool - more attacking - actually isn't as it makes easier to take over built metropolises, hence: nobody is in rush to build them, instead they're putting money in more armies and gaining new territories. End effect: Hades evens the swingy nature of the base game at the cost of making the game long, samey and outstaying its welcome. And paradoxically - more attacking actually pronounces economic nature of the game.

Titans does everything right where Hades went wrong. Hades as a God was only occasionally available, hence you needed to sit on money to get it when he came around. Titans work the other way - these units enable moves every turn (unless you're on Apollo), hence people have more control over their money and can spend it more accordingly to proper needs. The main dude is of course Chronos who by his power over time shortens the game - basically he gives free buildings. And some buildings also start the game on the board. And first two metropolises build even get a special bonus. So there's incentive to build them quickly, but with buildings entering play, they just happen, very soon actually. The map itself is a good idea - as with titan units movement is pronounced and much easier. Fleets now have a different role - one of gaining you upkeep with rich small (uninhabitable) islands and richer trade routes. With them it's much easier to build and economic base than it used to be. And then there are relics which are the new, improved heroes - they don't cost upkeep, no, they give you money (which seems so obvious it's weird how it was missed before). Basically Titans is a corrective of Hades  - instead of expansions that adds more and more stuff which just distracts from what pushes the game forward and makes it drag, oh so much, this expansions puts everything it has to make the game run faster. Everything in Titans is in this or other way connected to building metropolises or taking them from other players (either you get buildings or you get money).

So far we only played teams, so I'm not sure yet of how it is to play solo. And I'd need to play base game again to see how much of the crime of Hades is already imprinted in the base. Yes, this could have been a stand alone. For those saying it moves Cylades too near to Kemet I'd say: Hallelujah. I hate Kemet's tech tree (and tacky board art), but like other parts. Cyldes Titans is basically for me Kemet without those parts I find annoying.

Really wanted to like this game. I liked the picking gods doing things.... but doing stuff on the gameboard fell really flat for me. Monsters seemed like a waste of money but some were so OP that you *had* to buy them it seemed. Like the theme, like the components, but the game still fell flat for me. Other criticism of kingmaker/turtling totally valid and the only reason our game didn't drag on for another hour.

RATING: 7.5
Played 3 games with 2P, and 1 game with 3P. While Cyclades is a hybrid game, auctions are still the primary focus, and battles are simply a means to an end. I really love how each god is equally important to victory, so there is always a fierce contest each round. Thankfully, the map is cleverly constrained so battles to take over and expand territories are inevitable. Combine the tight gameplay with gorgeous components and you've got a great game.

There are 2 downsides I can think of. The first is the anticlimactic end as the winner can be predicted 2 or 3 rounds before the game actually finishes. Secondly, the one 3-player game I tried outlasted its welcome, which soured my impressions of Cyclades somewhat. I think this has to do with the fact that only 2 of the 4 variable gods are available each turn, which restricts players' options and slows down the game. I've lowered my ratings for Cyclades over time, but this is still a neat game to play when I'm in the mood for a more combative game.

A Brother to Zargos : 

- Random is every where
- A really too long game duration for the result of the game.
- In my few last games, always the same configuration : 

Waiting for the good configuration to finish my move, let's look to the others players : 

"Humm... They are juste looking to this configuration too..."
"Hope the good configuration will occure on my turn"

Really too long and random for a false strategy game, that is in fact just "a roll a dice" to determine who will win after a 2H.
And players' actions leading to this point are, at least for me, boring.

Straight forward strategy war game with a taste of auctioning. From a first play, I deducted a conclusion that money is very important, but you can also win a game if you have other plans in mind, and other players let you do it (not intentionally :)). Low grade is just because I am not a big fan of war games, but this is definitely a good war game, and I would like to play it couple of more times to see other winning options.

Nem könnyű ezt a játékot értékelnem. Jó mechanizmusok tényleg jól összegyúrva, de mindent felülír, hogy csak egy nyertese lehet a játéknak és nem igazán lehet helyezéseket felállítani. A játékosok istenek kegyeit keresik egy Amun-Re-ben megismert licitmechanizmus nagyon kicsi módosításával. Adott isten segítségével különböző akciók lehetségesek a körben. Mindig lesz egy játékos, aki nem tud segítséget kérni a körben, ő viszont pénzt és későbbi jövedelmet szerezhet. Kellemes része ez a játéknak. Az akciók közben lehetőség van különböző teremtmények felbérlésére, akik nagyon színesítik a játékmenetet és erős behatással lehetnek a játékra. A térkép kör alakú, ahol vízen és szárazföldön lehet harcolni. A csata nem túlbonyolított, nem túl vészes szerencsefaktorral kitalált. A cél két metropolisz felhúzása. Ez több módon összejöhet. 4 filozófus kártya beadásával, 4 különböző épület felhúzásával vagy egyszerűen csak másénak az elfoglalásával. Elsőre nekem egy hibája van a Cycladesnek, de az sajnos óriási. Egy nyertes van, a többiek vesztesek. Legtöbbször jól érzékelhető ki áll nyerésre, ennek megakadályozására feláldozza valaki magát így ők ketten nem nyerhetnek, nyer más. 3 játékosnál ez nagyon kellemetlen lehet, de nekünk 4 játékos esetében is egyértelmű volt a végkimenetel. Talán 2 játékos esetén lenne ez a legkevésbé fájdalmas dolog, de ketten viszont a jó licitmechanizmusnak nem lenne semmi értelme a játékban. Szóval számomra így nem jó játék a Cyclades minden erénye ellenére.

[i]Fun Game, but Suffers Heavily from Weird End-Game and Kingmaker Issues[/i]

Best with ? Players

I like this game, especially with the expansion -- the mix of auctions and combat provide the blend of economy and combat that I love in games (probably due to my RTS gaming roots).

You can build stuff, you can expand, and you can bid perfectly on every auction... but if you do not take your opponents into account and defend yourself, it will all be taken away from you in an instant.

Between the combat and the special card powers, there are quite a few paths to victory, and this game challenges you to successfully valuate who is in the lead now, who will be next turn, the turn after that, and how they will get there -- and then not just "outperform them" as you would do in a low-interaction game, but [i]beat them[/i]. That's my kind of thing.

Also, I find it hilarious that they felt it was necessary to include unique plastic miniature molds for mythological creatures that are on the board for ONE TURN! Instead of just some stupid counter or cardboard standup or something. That's some shit I haven't seen since the 90s!

That said, I wish the plastic saw more use, as it's really cool looking and then just goes away, doesn't seem right

(3 Design + 4 Enjoyment)

[hr]After a few plays, I think the end-game feels weird. Unless you get "eliminated" early, you will most likely find yourself in a position to win, along with other players, and the last turn feels almost like a tie-breaker in itself, ripe for kingmaking whether you try to win yourself (if you have the clear initiative other players will have to collude to stop you, empowering someone else) or try to stop others (another mole that can win this turn will pop up)

Also, the kingmaking and bean counting at the end is  probably a nightmare with good memories, open-money or notes, as the information about how much money people have is theoretically completely trackable despite the rules saying to hide it (a sin in my eyes) Design docked.

Another "self balancing" multi-player wargame that requires everyone to beat on the leader in order normalize the game.  Best way to win is to not care about losing.  Let the other people do the work and sneak a win from second place.  Pretty typical stuff.  

There is real strategy here.  Here's what you have to do to get anything done: earn money and discounts (from auctions), win the auction to get you ships together, win the auction to make guys and move them on ships, then roll the dice to see if it was worth it. It takes so long to do anything in this game that the strategy is to catch everyone with their pants down and time a victory set-up so that no one can resist it (otherwise it is a cycle of pain).  

Everyone is playing a "don't hit me, hit him game" as the game gracefully forces an end condition. Best to stay out of people's way in the first half of the game, no need to do anything too productive making yourself a target.  Rather, build up your efficiency.

I will say that thematically it is cool, and the art is awesome.  If I were 14 this game would be amazing. If some teenage kid wanted to play this with me, I would gladly, but the likelihood of that happening is about zero.

When I read the rules, I was worried that the combat would make the game way too random.  But in fact, there wasn't really that much combat.  As Ares and Poseidon can only be played by one person each a turn, the game is much more about managing your wealth and winning the right auction at the right moment.  

I don't think it is a very good two or three player game, so far; playing it with that number seemed meh.  My two five player games were much more fun.  That being said, the finishes so far have all been, to my mind, quite random as to exactly who won.  TIf every game ends with that much randomness, I think I will not like the game in the long run.

Been having so much fun with this one. Excellent combination of bidding and war: a hybrid of Eurogame and Ameritrash (Eurotrash). To date, this is my most beautiful game to look at (wish someone would paint my minis though). Really, I find it absolutely stunning - the sculpts for each of the five armies are different, the map looks colorful, but in a very tasteful way, the artwork is fabulous, and even the player sheilds are a pleasure to stare at. 

There is quite a high level of luck in the battles, but the play time is short, and to me, its not the kind of game where the luck ever reaches a  frustrating level. The mythical creatures deck adds variation to each game too. 

Note - we have house ruled that only three creatures max can be replaced with the power of zeus.The mechanic of paying gold to riffle through the entire deck is to me just, well...silly. Also thinking of house ruling the Pegasis power down quite a bit. The effect of these house rules is to bend the game a tiny bit to our desires. Without these house rules, the game can tend to make huge, quick swings in power, and we prefer a slower, more evenly paced game - but that's just us.

Only play this with the full compliment of 5 players.
I would love to play this game more, but I don't get to play with 5 players a lot. If I do, I would always suggest playing Cyclades.
The simultanous auction is the heart of the game, where players try to get the favor of one of the greek gods. With this favor they try to build metropolises and crush each others armies and fleets.
Turn order is a huge aspect of the auction as well, since there is limited availability of some powerful mythological creatures which can completely throw the game.

Sold.

Beautiful art and bits.  Love the Amun-Re style auction for the god powers.  Unfortunately, this is a race game, and so the abrupt victory can make it fall flat.  At least it does seem that everyone is in it, there are a couple of paths to victory and certainly some conflict among players elevates above many other race games out there.

An outstanding game, combining good elements and mechanics from other games, but doing so with elegance, lots of theme and gorgeous artwork.  Not very complex rules/mechanics, and readily learned. Relaxing but exciting (if that's possible), and very little player 'down time'. Genuinely works for 2 to 5 players (how often can you say that?).  A treat to play.

This is an example of a game that has chrome but fails to deliver. I would describe it as being the big brother of Hellas. It's strange that I should enjoy Hellas but not this. Souless.

Good hybrid of euro-style auctions and war mechanics. The battle system works well: there's just enough luck to create some uncertainty but not enough to undermine good strategy. The theme is fantastic, aided by top-notch components. I have some concerns about the chaotic end-game, and there may be a card that's too powerful, but so far I like it. I just wish turtling weren't so rewarded. Also, and I'm not sure how to put this, but the game appears bigger than it is. Or smaller than I'd like it to be. The presentation promises an epic dudes-on-a-map game and only half delivers.

As an aside, I can't help but wonder what would happen to my opinion of Cyclades if I were to play Amun-Re, which is where the auction mechanic comes from.

One of my favourite area control games. The auction mechanism that allow for bidding on the god powers really makes the game shine.

I've played both the core game and the Titans expansion, and like them both equally. The Titans expansion allows for more attacking, which prevents the final turn of the core game being a "rush" to bid for Ares.

Gods, they can be fickle, they can be angry, they can be generous, but most of all, they can be expensive!!!!! Cyclades is a sort of war game in which you try to buy the favor of several costly gods by out bidding your unworthy heathen opponents. If you succeed the gods will reward your patronage with gifts of warriors, ships, philosophers and other goodies. If you fail to outbid your opponents then you'll have to just pray to Apollo who will give you a few bucks and maybe a cornucopia if you're lucky. Then you take your rewards and honor the gods by murdering everyone in sight! Fun! You also get to enlist the aid of several mythological beasts who help you do various things,including helping you murder everyone in sight. Turns out killing in the name of gods is a hell of a lot of fun, now I finally understand the appeal of the crusades! I should also mention that they did a god damned awesome job with the components in this game..superb! And the god bidding is way more fun than I thought. great game, I swear to god(s)

RATING: 6
I'm a Risk lover for what it's worth and halfway through this game I was completely enthralled and considering giving it a 9.  Towards the end some problems became apparent.  First, the end boiled down to kingmaking and I can see where that could be a common occurrence.  Second, only one player maximum can attack by land or sea each turn, which just seems strange to a Risk player.  Third, it seems like it's difficult to attack without making yourself very vulnerable, partially because you're quite limited on the forces you can build, again unlike Risk.  I had such fun the first half that I still liked it overall, but I have reservations about its staying power.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting mix of auction and area control game with some very, very light battle mechanics.  The auction is the bulk of the game but what you are auctioning off are actions in the area control "arena".

I actually really, really like this game mechanics- and design-wise.  The auction is very well designed, the order of the gods changes each turn and the order dictates the order of their use and the earlier you go in one turn the later you go in the next.  Also, being outbid on one god tile prohibits you from jumping back onto the same god's auction track.

The mythical creatures also provide a great way to diversify the game and place more pressure on early picks in the auction even if that particular god isn't your ideal choice.  I also really like the design choice to prevent player elimination by disallowing conquering of a player's last island unless it provides you a win.  This combined with the 4-gold Apollo bonus for having only one island are great catch up mechanics.

All of this makes for an incredibly well designed game...with some really faulty end-game goals that brings it down quite a bit. For an area control game, this one really discourages player interaction past the auction phase which is a big problem for me.  Outside of the powers of some of the mythical creatures, combat with other players "the honest way" requires so much time and resources it doesn't seem worth it.  The big problem is that with multiple players harassing each other usually it is the quiet person who takes a lead in the game while they are unmolested.  Then this person is usually just stonewalled in getting their second metropolis which just delays them for a few turns while they collect more resources and others spend all theirs to stop them.

One criticism I do feel is unfair is I've heard it put down because of the amount of time it takes to "do so little" on a turn but I think that's because people don't look at the area control aspect as ancillary or reactionary to the auction phase.  This is at its core an auction game and the auctions are deep, complex, and exciting and don't even take the time an auction in Power Grid would, for example.  But when taking the actions you won in auction you make little ripples in the game at a time and if someone looks at the giant board full of islands, troops, and fleets and expects this to be a sweeping area control or war game they are going to be disappointed with the little bit they get to do during that phase.

I would have loved all the game play of this game with a different objective, I just feel that they don't fit together very nicely and it can kind of spoil it towards the end game when you notice the problems with it.  I still really like the game for the journey though.

Loved it. Games where you are engrossed for 90 minutes and forget everything else going on around you get an A+ in my book.  Both girls loved playing this game.  The rules confused them at first but they got the hang of it quickly and were just as engrossed as I was.  I won by invading Emily with a massive fleet at the end to acquire my second Metropolis.  She saw it coming, and the laughter from her pleading for help was worth the price of the game alone.  This will see much playing time.

Low trade interest but I'll entertain offers.

I had to work really hard to get my fingers on a copy of this gem. Or hard isn't the right word, but my FLGS didn't really help me. I was in the store five different times for three weeks asking if they could check with their supplier if they had the game. Every time they said: "We will call them today/tomorrow/this afternoon, but the guy who is responsible for the board game section isn't here right now." The other five guys who always seem to be in the store couldn't call for some freaking reason. After three weeks I realized that they didn't want my business so I ordered it online instead. For that I ain't sorry, because this is a good game. Great components, easy rules and fast with many tense moments. A little bit of AP when the possibilities in some of the more powerful creatures hit the board, but otherwise OK. That the rate isn't higher is that some of the creatures are a little too powerful and that the game shifts too fast depending on with player who has a lucky break with them. This could possible disappear when we have played the game a bit more so we can plan for it in advance, but as it stands now it's too much chaos, and then someone wins, and it hasn't been me yet.

101211: 3 plays, rating 8.
At last I got this on the table. It is still a great game but the AP is there in the end and the last game the end really draged. Bad dicerolls and bad card draws made the other 3 players to miss open goals.

One game with 3 players and another one with only 2.

Game components are obviously excellent. Great art work once again from Miguel Coimbra (although I like Giants better). The auction mechanism is pretty good like in Amun Re or Vegas Showdown but that's all because once you're done with the auction everything else can be pure chaos because of, especially, the cards. Cards can ruin 3 or 4 turns in a single action.

But my major complaint goes for two strong reasons: first of all the fact that the player who has the most money has the advantage to get even more money - the possibilities of a player to recover are poor. Even if a player can recover from a serious defeat the game is not very fun anymore because it takes too much time for that player to get back into the game. The second reason has to do with the bash the leader feeling. It's obvious that once all players know that someone goes ahead in the game, that player has to be controlled by other's actions. This is something I don't like in games.

I can give it another try but I'm not sure I'll change my opinion about it.

Traded away.

Good, beautifully thematic game that is broken with 3 players.

I've decided my main issues with this game are mostly only a concern with 3 players. 2 players should be fine as the god tiles and bidding system is played as in a 4 player game. I also believe that the expansion will address most of my issues. I never play it 3 players.

I'm generally not a fan of bidding games but this one works for me okay.

Game endings can be sudden and dice dependent at times but this can be part of the fun.

I got to play a 5 player game and it still had the same issue. Although not as pronounced.

Great auctioning system (You bid to the gods and your actions for the whole round are limited by which god favours you). Island hopping side of it is fine, but you really need to be aggressive!

Kraken is great, but the other monster miniatures are mostly wasted, since they rarely come out. Main problem, however, is the anticlimactic end-conditions and the fact that if you get pushed back onto a single, crappy island, you can get a bit stuck.

That all said, I think this is one of my favourite games ;)

+ Great art and components.

+ No player elimination and come back are possible.
+ You can always see what is coming. To problem is having the will (or money!) to do it.
DISLIKE
- Without the 2 metropolis at the beginning of your turn rule, endings are anti-climatic.
- Even though you always move toward the end game, progression (especially movement) can feel slow.
- Certain creatures at the right moment can win the game.
VERDICT
The perfect ameritrash and euro blend in in less than 90 minutes. Truly epic feel. Most of the flaws are fixed by the Hades expansion (I never play without it now).

RATING: 8
This is a "first impressions" rating after a single play with 5 players.  It remains to be seen if my rating will change with further plays!  Right after the game ended, a good friend of mine commented that this game could have been custom designed for me - a compelling theme, gorgeous components, clever resource management, a bit of conflict, plenty of player interaction, and the same design team that created one of my favourite games of all time, "Mr. Jack".  And he was absolutely correct!  But it's not perfect, of course.  My biggest complaint was that the game end came rather suddenly just when I felt I was starting to make some progress in the game, which made it feel a little anticlimactic.  Sure, the end game conditions keep the game length very reasonable, but this is the type of game I don't mind spending longer on.  (In contrast to these statements, one of the game designers has commented that games tend to be longer with more experienced players, since they learn how to better interfere with their opponents' victory plans.)  Also, I fell behind early with my income, and spent the rest of the game picking up the scraps left by everyone else.  I would have liked to see a bit more money in play - perhaps even 1 or 2 gold pieces added each game turn to the regular income - although I don't know if this would simply result in bigger auctions.  My hope would be that a bit more income would result in a little more ebb and flow in a game that feels somewhat too static considering all the amazing armies and ships that are in play.  I wonder if these problems were partly a result of playing with 5 players.  Perhaps with 3 or 4, I would feel like I was able to accomplish more in the game.  [Edit: After trying a 2-player game, I can vouch for the fact that it plays very well with 2 and doesn't have the same issues that I just discussed above, although I wish I could have a similar experience with a higher number of players.]  But don't get me wrong - this is a fun and very compelling game, and I can't wait to play it again!  And the production value is nothing short of spectacular.  The fact that each player has different sculpts for their armies and even their ships is astounding!  And I'm enjoying painting up those 5 mythological creatures...  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

Hm another hybrid of wargame and euro by Mr Cathala. Something like [gameid=33107]. Looks like more successful attempt, and may be enjoyable but... I hardly feel urge to try it again more than one or two times.

I must admit that Cyclades nicely mix bidding system with changing order of play, dontime is low, game is quick, high-quality components are very nice, and in overall it look like serious attempt to create short, intense and interesting game. But I cannot decide what doesn't fit: Too many euro-ish elements? Effectively winning the game due to properly handled bidding and building diminishes importance of war. But you can war -- but war usually are devastating and bring not too much gain (in fact, this is like in reality, through this game ask you for some conflict and then makes it unsatisfactory). Also, too many plans simply evolve from results of bidding.

Of course, this is biased opinion: Games that require you to build proper number of items and army units and then finally use them in final blows are not my favorites. It is hard to focus on building while your plans can be disrupted at any moment but some sudden attack. But something simply doesn't fit here. So, try first before you buy.

EDIT: After second play I'm upgrading the rating a bit -- three-player game is quite satysfying.

Pegaz kažnjava onog koji se nije pripremio. Tempo je ključan: Mapa kroz igru postaje sve bogatija ali to bogatstvo se rasipa kroz sve jače nadmetanje igrača za sklonost bogova. Tako da je moguće da pobijediš i sa slabijom privredom ako svi ostali udaraju po gasu a ti prvi shvatiš kad je vrijeme za kočenje. Konkretno, valja imati na umu da sve što ti treba za pobjedu jesu dvije metropole. Dakle raspon bodova je 0, 1, 2. Bez obzira koliko se tko čini jak, dobar plan jako brzo može trenutnog gubitaša nagraditi pobijedom. Neki kažu da igra završava neočekivano - ne bih se složio. Igra završava točno u pravom trenutku.

A slow and ponderous area control wargame. Because players bid for the exclusive right to take certain actions, an economic force can easily dominate the endgame.

Manages to perfectly blend gameplay with theme. The rules are simple (contained within five pages) but there's still a lot going on in this game. The basic premise is that the player controls various Greek gods who in turn bestow various powers, which then enable the player to develop their civilization across the Cyclades islands - the first player to develop two metropolises wins the game. For example, Poseidon controls a player's fleets and ports, Ares controls their armies and fortresses, Zeus controls their priests and temples etc. As only one player can have access to a certain god's powers per cycle (round), tactical bidding takes place to see who earns the privilege. There's also a number of creatures from Greek mythology whose services can be acquired and these also provide greater depth of decision making to the game. The artwork and overall presentation of the game is excellent, which means that as well as being challenging to play, it's also visually appealing.

Cyclades has been on my wishlist for a while but I was concerned that the auction wouldn't be a good basis for a Dudes on a Map game. I was completely wrong as by keeping almost all the action on the game board, limiting the aggressive actions available and not having special player powers players can concentrate on the effect of their actions on the overall game state. It just works so smoothly and is a brilliant piece of design. I was also concerned that the end game would be awful but it wasn't too bad. As the new player I was the weakest link and made any number of errors but I came away with an appreciation for the jostling necessary to set yourself up to clinch victory before anyone else can. I'm almost guaranteed to pick this up next year.

RATING: 8.5
1st play : 2.5 hours, 2 players.

2nd Play : 1 hour, 2 players.  We are finally understanding the power of the creatures.  Interesting combos can be made (if you can pay) within the limited actions of 2 gods per turn.  Mostly 1 god is doing the heavy lifting so I can see these moves working in a multiplayer game.  Your best laid plans are quickly vanquished so you better have a plan B at all times.  

Surprisingly my wife likes this "war game".  It's beautiful and highly functional.  I wonder about the limited scope of strategy after a few games.  My wife does not think so.  I think that it is a 'players make the game' type of game.

update : watch the other players very close.  My wife tricked me so easily tonight spreading around buildings and collecting philosophers.  I concentrated on a sea entrapment strategy but she thwarted my efforts with a fierce sea attack.

5 player review, 2.5 hours: That was extremely entertaining.  It came down to the wire after a decisive battle with the leader to everyone being on the edge of winning.  Maneuvers were made and at least 3 players were on the verge of winning.  Who won?  The non-gamer at the table who had quietly amassed fortune and troops to snatch victory with a huge bid for Athena, got the needed philosophers and built her 2nd metropolis.

All in all a fun game with moderate strategy and much leader bashing.  Dice rolls were cheered on.  Most entertaining was positioning one player to take out the leader, only to realize we were setting him up for the win.  It led to massive infighting amongst the losers.  Really fun to watch happen.

Also Expansion: Hades

Cyclades is, to me, Risk combined with Worker Placement on a sparser map. The transformation is magnificent. Care has been made to ensure that every path is a path to victory. Athena can net you a Metropolis, conquest can new you someone else's without as much time or work ... but requires the proper use of two gods and thus at least as many turns, Zeus gives you a marvelous discount that gets you ahead in the bidding war and Apollo gives you a leg up in bidding through sheer cash--gives your wallet a 1-turn break, increases your income, and gives you a little gold up-front.

It's brilliant. The map itself, too, is a masterwork. The land/sea divide makes it an intensely logistical game and makes war-making a robust and rewarding process.

Cyclades is a game of bluster, of misdirection, and of count-downs. You're always watching the count-down until your opponent has roughly too much money, is too close to that second metropolis through too many means, has too many troops, has too much naval control. You're watching the imaginary count-downs until your opponents get what they want (or take what you want) and the experience is intelligent, thrilling, and lovely to look at.

One cannot talk about Cyclades without mentioning that it is an utterly gorgeous game. It is one of the prettiest objects I own, certainly among the most lovely board games next to Letters from Whitechapple and Cyclades's own companion game Kemet.

Fantastic game. Truly thematic, full of strategy and fun bidding, but with enough unexpected twists and turns to keep things exciting and not overly predictable (particularly through the use of the Monsters Deck). And the miniatures are flat-out terrific -- especially the monsters. One of my favorite games.

we actually had a lot of fun the games we played. Not sure how much I want to play again, it did take a while and I think we had a kingmaking issue at the end. I mean I got sick of one player and just helped the other guy win as it was going on and on. I did like the bidding system and the gods.

Me and my girlfriend really love this game.

It's easy to teach and to learn, but it's really deep too. You almost always have a lot of option each turn. Each god gives you interesting options and none is a bad choice. Also, if you get stuck with a god you didn't need for this turn, you can alway buy a creature to screw your opponents (except if you got Apollo). Played this game a lot of times and it never feels repetitive since the gods available and their order is random eahc turn, and the creatures available also. 

Most wins are always a surprise. You have one player well on his way to win and bang! On the last turn, it's the least succesful player that manages a masterful stroke to win. For example, in one 2 player game I had no metropolis and my girlfriend had 2 (you need 3 to win in a 2 player game). In the last turn, she managed to build her last metropolis for an almost certain win, but playing last, I managed to gain a fourth philosopher so I got my first metropolis, i bought a University to complete my set of for building which got me my second metropolis, and I bought the pegasus card which allowed me to invade one of her island and steal one of her metropolis which got me my third. You should have seen the look on her face...

The game is built in a way that you will never be stuck with nothing to do on a turn. You can obtain a metropolis through contruction, philosophy or military might. 

You could break the game by abusing the power of Zeus, cycling through the creatures deck and coming up with unbeatable creatures combo, but it is easily house-ruled.

The other thing that might be problematic is that you have to build a bridge of ship to be able to invade with your troops. It works fine in the game, but it is strange and most people struggle with this aspect of the game.

My favorite game.

Speedy bidding game with a fantastic "Clash of the Titans" typ theme and jaw dropping artwork.  Every decision matters and the game is fun-tense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Cyclades feels like one step above Risk, but it's a small step and not a major improvement. The auction mechanic means simply that you're trying to capture territories that generate income and this frames the initial strategy.

The Pegasus card seems somewhat overpowered and tends to determine the winner. A let down.

A second play where everyone was warned of the dangers of Pegasus. The die rolls are so few that if the first 4 or 5 go against you, you have no chance (it happened twice in 2 games). We had an hour of outbidding people to prevent them winning. We should have just let someone win and end the pain.

6.3 to 4.5 after a second play (March 2012).

RATING: 9.5
I thought that the conflict would be on the board, but the real conflict happens with the auctions.  I have never played a game where the auctioning took so much clever planning and the stakes got so high.  I am pleasantly surprised with this feature and it is so much fun that it is ok with me that it is the source of conflict.  The auction system partially works so well because of the fact you can only perform one type of action and if somebody else needs that you must beat them in the auction and still have the gold to perform your actions.  Pick up this game.  Works great with those that are even new to boardgames.

RATING: 3
The components in Cyclades are gorgeous; the game drags. Every move is glacially made and readily countered. The game wanders aimlessly toward the finish, until suddenly it becomes a looney-tunes scrum to prevent anyone from stealing the win. Repeatedly.

It's a good game, but it doesn't work very well with my game group. It often ends predictably with the player who gets the infamous Pegasus and proceeds to decisively snatch the victory from the hands of his opponents. This is after at least 60% of the playing time had been spent by everyone at the table trying to keep each other from winning.

Wow! After a first play this seems a perfect melange between luck and strategy, ameritrash and euro. Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc did an amazing job with this one. Looking forward to play some more, and rating might change.

Update: Something's fishy about it. We had some serious knigmaking situation today, during my 3rd play. For the moment dropped it from 9.5 to 8.5.

Update: It finally convinced me, but in a negative way. It is an ok game, but can be very frustrating. There are times during the game when you simply sit and watch how the others smash you without being able to do a thing. I won my last game, but the frustration during it beat the satisfaction of winning.

RATING: 6
Quite an interesting game.  It's great except for the imbalanced cards.  Cards like the Pegasus are always a bargain at 4 coins, and others will never be bought for 2 coins.  The game really shifts into a group puzzle near the end to keep everyone else from winning, and I think that really hurts it.  I like the first half of the game where people are expanding and slowly upgrading their presence.

Cyclades is a quick game with lots of direct conflict. On first glance, I had a few preconceived notions about the game that colored my experience. I was screwed over early in the game, pouted for a bit, complained about how the game might be "broken," but then managed to mount a comeback. In other words, I was a sore loser and a whiner for no good reason. I didn't win, but the game was better than I thought it was going to be, and I immediately wanted to try again. Lesson learned. I have to watch myself when I lose -- how much does the bias of losing affect how I feel about any game?

Luckily, that was years ago and I've had the opportunity to play Cyclades again. The game is certainly fun. It's a quick-paced conquest game that asks the players to balance action selection, defense, and offense. The mythological creatures add spice to the game; however, they can also be very powerful and lead to large swings of position (you may like or hate this element of the game).

I have a new concern now, however, and that is one of king-making. Towards the end of the game, someone may need to prevent another player from winning. If he or she doesn't prevent the win (perhaps because of oversight or because he assumed someone else would), subsequent players may have no way to do the same. In this case, the first player will win in a king-maker scenario. This is very similar to multi-player [thing=8051]Attika[/thing], for example, and it can be dissatisfying.

The game is solid, but certainly not one of my favorites. I'd happily play it again if someone put it on the table, but I think I'd aim for a four- or five-player game so as to increase the chances of everyone having to battle someone else tooth and nail -- which should in turn cut down on king-making opportunities.

I love this game in theory and really wanted to like it, particularly as it looked like a perfect blend of euro and Ameritrash. Only played it two player so far so I have hope that multiplayer will be better. But it just fell flat. Turns felt repetitive, the bidding particularly, with some tension but very simple. The combat is meh. I don't mind the slow build up and I like the different elements and how they work together, but it just feels very simple and dry. Also the miniatures look very average.

But again there are some things I like about it a fair bit so hopefully with more players I will like it more. As a two player game though, it was ok at best. And even that might be generous.

A beautifully produced game with fantastic components. I really looked forward to play this game. Unfortunately it left me with a bit of an empty feeling. It looks so good - especially the monsters (that I painted). However I guess for me the game is just a bit to short..or something. I have a bit of a hard time to put my finger on it. It just didn't click for me. It might be that the slow start with a sudden rush for victory, in a very short span of time, isn't the kind of game that I like.

I think this game was ruined for me in my first game.

A curious fusion of Euro mechanics (bidding for abilities/actions, buildings that grant bonus abilities before being turned into bigger buildings to win, etc.) and pure Ameri-trash (army and monster sculpts, die-rolling battles). Works well, but Cyclades has some weird dynamics, where at some points the rich seem to get richer (players who secure/grow their income sources are able to win bids and get the actions they want, which leads to more income, armies, buildings, etc.), while at other points the leader-bashing is pretty intense (depending on what monsters are available). As a light war game, Cyclades works fine, but it's chaotic and the winner will usually be not the person who planned and played best, but the player who didn't get picked on the most. Not my cup of tea, but it is an interesting little hybrid game.

Cyclades is accessible at the expense of being engaging.  Yes, it is a develop & conquer game that can be played in under an hour, however the auctions are imbalanced, the movement is clunky, and combat is nearly elusive. With the exception of wildly imbalanced cards, everything is resolved very simply.  Cyclades feels like a kids' game.

I got this from a friend of mine and introduced it to my group about a month ago. It's one of those games where the rules only really make sense as you start to play the game.

There are so many things going on that it's easy for someone to sneak up for the win.  If you get taken down early, don't worry.  There are ways to catch up.  Also, I'm a sucker for auctions, which play a big role in selecting which actions you can take on your turn.

RATING: 7.5
A fun and surprisingly quick game that seemlessly combines a Euro-style auction game with an Ameritrash-style combat game.

I'm not yet sure if the fact that it wraps up in 60-90 minutes is a good thing or a bad thing.  Although I appreciate games that don't take an entire evening to play, I wonder if there's enough opportunity for ebb and flow, and the ending tends to sneak up on me.

The Hades expansion is a worthwhile addition because it further encourages violence.

I really can't fairly rate Cyclades until further playings.  Our first play took 150 minutes, mostly due to players really moving slowly during the offering phase.  My hope is that repeated playings will increase familiarity and decrease downtime.

Anyways, it is a pretty cool game, with a few blemishes that I feel are significant, but not so much that they wreck the game.  Not having the time or patience to go into them right now, I'll just say that the game can be really frustrating at times.

I did like it, though.  I feel that in our game, we did not play aggressive enough, and that we just kind of kept to ourselves way too much--not good in a game that is built on conflict.  Time will tell.

Cyclades is a decent little auction game with conflict and a nice theme. The pieces in the game are fun to play with and look at. The decisions are interesting. But for some reason, it just doesn't ever feel super...fun. I don't know, maybe I need to try it more. And I will, but each time I do, I walk away with the same feeling of...[i]emptiness[/i]. I just can't wrap my finger around what it is I don't like about it, but there is something. It's good enough that I'm glad my nephew owns it, and I'll get the chance to pull it out every now and then.

In the end, I think I have to say that it's just a bit of a boring game. Everything moves a little too slowly for a game of this nature.

Pretty though. I guess that only ensure more to me that great components do nothing for me if there's nothing exciting behind the game play.

Just got this and love it straight of the bat. For me it's a great multiplayer game that you can teach older kids which has war game elements. I have heard with older more experienced players it can become a game of take down the leader but as a family game it is great and teaches positioning and forward thinking. Elegant design easy to teach a lot of fun.

There's cool art. There's fun mini's (particularly the Kraken). The auction system plays out well. There's multiple paths to victory and tiles-with-benefits. I'm not someone who relishes direct conflict in games, but it's also not an automatic disqualifier. For me, I feel like it comes down to an inability to make and execute long-term plans. If the other players want Zeus and Ares, sure, their eventual in-game poverty offsets your lack of priests and soldiers, but it feels limiting.

RATING: 7
Good game, with smooth mechanics but horrendous iconography.  It seems to always lack a little something that stops it from being great, it just doesn't seem to have that next gear that makes a good game great.  Tried adding the Hades expansion and while it does add some flair it still has that same feeling.

I will say the Hades expansion feels like it belongs in the base game to a large degree.

Hades adds some additional things to think about, Magic Items and Priestesses are nice additions.  Divine Favors can really open up some new play options and the Heroes both make combat more interesting and can serve to "fix" the "problem" with Zeus' cycling the creature deck with impunity.  There are also official rules for variable setup.

This game is fun in that there are multiple routes that you can take towards victory. Some powers seem over-powered, such as Zues's ability to cycle through the monster deck.

This is a clever game, that has some highly innovative mechanisms. (Well, so I thought until I played the older Amon-Ra)

However ending the game is the game. You'll spend hours repeatedly denying victory to the enemy until you lose your concentration and one of your opponents outplays EveryOne.

This is a game that becomes a chore and outstays it's welcome, and one of those games where you really don't want to congratulate the winner.

A pity.

A fun game with a theme that I love.  My group is still exploring all of the tricks and nuances of the game but we have yet to have a bad play.  We all agree though that the bidding mechanic is what sets this one apart and causes us all to want to come back for another play.  I plan on painting the minis soon enough.

RATING: 8
Received in BGG secret santa exchange 2010.

Finally got a chance to get this to the table. Conflict aplenty in this game. An interesting auction mechanic for role selection ensures that only one person gets to take each different action per turn. Apollo is a nice way to bounce back if you are knocked down early. This ensures a close finish. Conquering another metropolis seems the best way to get your second.

RATING: 6
A good enough area control game, with some light engine building. There may be a bit too much to keep track of and the ability to update islands felt a bit tacked on (beyond 2 of each upgrade being a win condition). The auction is interesting, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Two games down and this one gets an 8. I really enjoy the bidding mechanic in this one and as there's one less action than players (not counting Apollo) it makes those bid hugely important. I'm looking forward to play it some more and hoping that the game end push isn't frequently Zeus cycling the deck looking for Pegasus or Chimera to reactivate Pegasus.

Just a fantastic game that uses all of its mechanics so well! The bidding is tense and the area control is great. It is not as combat oriented as Kemet, and with the different ways to get you metropoli (strong economy, philosophers, battle) there are a lot of valid strategies. The thing that I love most about this game, and I feel the same way about Kemet, is that you have no idea who is going to win until it's over. It feels like everyone is just a small push away from winning it all. Plus with the hidden coins, you never know who can make the bigger push. One of my favorite games.

I think it was summed up best when someone called this game a "nutpuncher" and a "slapfight".  Anybody who threatens to win is pummeled down until somebody gets lucky.  It's just a lot of "take that" back and forth.  

It's not necessarily a bad game, it's just one that I don't enjoy.  Very much at all.

Ambientado en la Grecia mitológica. Se subastan apuestas por los cuatro dioses, cada uno permite una serie de acciones, al tiempo que adquirir criaturas mitológicas durante tu turno que las conservas hasta tu turno siguiente. Gana el que mantiene dos metropolis en sus islas hasta final del turno, que a su vez se pueden construir con 4 edificios distintos o con 4 filósofos. Buen temático y componentes de calidad, aunque se queda escaso en batalla y las criaturas mitológicas al final tienen poca presencia

Fun game with some of many things: bidding, attacking, resource collection, special effects.  The tempo builds and the games have ended in a rush and bang with a bit of chaos.  Maybe I lose my sure-victory in the hectic ending, or maybe I steal someone else's win, but the game and its ending provides fun if you let it. Good playing time length also; if our games went a hour, it was a quick hour.

I almost love this game. Most of the game has a great use of Euroish mechanics in an American-style game, but the endgame really just ruins things for me. The fact that you can dig for a Pegasus to do an out-of-nowhere attack to win the game - something nearly impossible to defend against, too - just makes great planning seem pointless. Well, that and the rest of the endgame, with "No, you have to stop him there!" dominating the last couple turns and way overextending it, but the Pegasus thing just gets stuck in my craw.

There's no Matagot game I didn't enjoy. So this one is to be picked up at Essen 09. Or would have been if it would have been completed by then. :(

Bought the "wooden" edition, registered at the figures-website and... nothing. Some people already received their figures but me? No sir. And no replies on emails too.

Edit: Got the figures after a while. Now I'm again completely blown away by the optics and cought by the game itself. :-)

Update: After plaing the game I kind of wonder why there are monster figures in the game ... they look awesome but that's all. Fun game but again something that doesn't fully live up to the optics.

Bidding, developing a city, everything in a great theme. That's one of my favorite games. The auction in the beginning of each turn is simple and developed in a fantastic way. 
The game has a variety of ways to get the Metropolis and that variety makes almost every strategy possible.
The theme: I am a huge fan of greek mythology and the theme is so important and fits perfectly in the mechanics created.
The only weakness in the game is the battle system, but the game is not about battles, is about the development of the Metropolis.

This is a fun game. Only played once and did terrible (focusing on the battle mechanics rather than going for the points needed to win). A lot going for it. Bidding for the God's assistance (to be able to complete certain actions). If everyone wants the same thing gold is king for the turn...but don't do what I did...try to prevent a foe from winning but bidding too high that I no longer had the resources to do what had to be done.

RATING: 6
Played with both 2 and 4 players. Cyclades combines different mechanics (conquest, auction and action selection) into a very confrontational, action-packed experience. With three ways to obtain your cities and the huge amount of player interaction, you need to be on your toes the whole time. You also need to keep a close eye on the possibilities that the mythologic creatures offer each turn. Victory is always nearer than you think. Still, there seem to be opportunities to catch up with the leader until the very end of the game. All in all, a very interesting and original game with lots of theme for those who do not mind a lot of confrontation. For me personally, it is a bit too fast and confrontational. The artwork (the art on the cards as well as the sculptures of the minis) is great, although the materials (cardstock and plastic) could have been a lot better.

RATING: 7
Graphics and components are excellent. 

Overall I liked the game. It is reasonably simple, quite fast and has nice aspects to it (light economic buildup + conflict). 

However, winning the game is all about timing. Who will achieve the winning conditions can be a sum of clever and lucky incidents. I don't really care that much for this kind of endings. Also, I did not like how most of the cards worked.

But anyway, this is difficult genre for a game, yet very intriguing. Cyclades is quite nice package and I am happy to play it again.

I really enjoyed this for the first half of the game. It was an intense auction game with different paths to victory and seemed fresh and exciting. The problem was at the end, when I was about to win, and the other players ganged up on me to ensure that I had no chance of winning. I would have been fine with this if it didn't happen to the new "leader" every subsequent round until everyone was too crushed to continue except for the eventually winner, and a player with a huge army who would have won if we weren't too defenseless to stop the leader from winning. This game seems pretty broken to me. I love conflict in games that allow for careful planning, but this is a 2 hour exercise of kingmaking.

This game can be brutal. It can be over in a flash if you're not paying attention. Take note of which monsters are for bid each round and how they might help other players.

Engraçado como a primeira impressão pode ser errada. Tinha jogado antes, mas jogando de novo mais recentemente com o Alê ficou bem mais interessante.

E Hades traz novas modificações muito interessantes.

Cyclades is amazing for giving you that epic wargame feel in under 2 hours.  Albeit slower paced than some, and more focused on the auction mechanism than combat.

It can make you impatient as it takes several rounds to achieve something as simple as sending troops to another Island, but that's also sort of it's charm and realism.  You see your opponents move fleets on a turn and you know their objective giving you a round to prepare.  I say realistic because it would have taken years to train troops and sail fleets out.

As slow paced as the game is, the ending can sometimes come out of nowhere once the end game Metropolis start popping up.

Cyclades: Titans really elevates the game to an exciting, more confrontational experience with lots of fun additions.

Cyclades has its flaws, but I really how the game progresses. Nations rise to power then hesitantly try not to build a metropolis until they absolutely have to. Then at the end of the game someone blows all of their money on 1 bid and there's a dramatic end game confrontation.

It's great to have a combat focused game where combat will probably only happen once or twice during the whole game.

Components boost this up to an 8, even though it's probably closer to 7.

RATING: 6
Rating is based on a five player game. I don't like the variance the cards get into the whole game. Some creatures turn the flow of the game upside-down. You have to plan flexible, or some cards just might screw you... then again, I don't like beeing screwed just because the wrong cards turned up. Maybe it's a bet like: If the card XYZ is drawn in the next 2 turns, I'm screwed - otherwise I win.

I don't like this in a game that looks strategic and takes this much time. With less than 5 players, some goods will be randomly put out each round?! Sounds not nice to me neither...

this is truly a marvelous game, great mechanics, great artwork, very very fun to play, easy to learn but difficult to master. I've been always fond of the greek mythology and in this game is very well depicted despite the simple mechanics. Mortals could grasp only for brief moments the favor of the gods or the help by the mythical creatures; but even the mighty Gods of Olympus must bend to the power of fate...

In a word: masterpiece!

After several play i've dropped the rating to 8. This game have an Eurogame soul that some time disturbs me.

RATING: 6
Very cool theme. Very cool pieces. Multi-player "war games" which play in a reasonable amount of time are definitely great.

However, the game play was somewhat disappointing. It was like Shogun in that the combat is quite secondary. In our game, only one ship combat took place before the game ended with someone building their second Metropolis. However, I wasn't really watching for that, so perhaps the person could have been stopped if we had been paying more attention...

One of my favorites to play with my girlfriend, as well as in a small group. I'll never forget one evening where a single game of Cyclades ended up taking 7 hours because the conversation (and wine) was flowing just perfectly - and at no point did the game seem to stretch out. Only after finishing did we realize we'd been going for so long. Didn't hurt that I won, either.

I recommend playing it.

The miniatures are absolutely gorgeous, and the mechanics are simple and deep enough for Euro freaks and conflict oriented enough for Ameritrashers.  And it plays very fast, as there's a threshold where there will be so many metropolises out there that somebody will manage to get two.  Theme is great, mechanics are great, components are great.  There's no other game that scratches the multiplayer dudes-on-a-map itch in so short a time frame.

The game looks very cool with the miniatures and mythological theme, but the gameplay seemed to be missing something.  You lose a battle and you lose everything.  If you build things up and become a target, then you lose while someone who lurks in the shadows sneaks in while no one is looking to win.  Seemes very random - especially if game play approaches 2 hours.

In a word: DYNAMIC! One of the charms of the game is that usually everyone is close to winning at the same time. This creates some tasty tension that will bring you back for more. Beware- this game is more than direct conflict, it is screwage, but that is part of the immense interaction that this game encourages between players. Cyclades is a fine example of balancing- You must balance your fluctuating alliances with the other players and your investment in the favor of each of the gods. The theme is especially salient and works with the game mechanics (see my [thread=613878]review[/thread]).

Неплохо, но есть ощущение, что чего-то не хватает.

Например баталии примитивны и не привлекательны. Существа, которые даже с фигурками почему-то действуют всего 1 ход. Я наивно предполагал, что напирмер Горгону поставил на остров и все - фигли.

Есть нетривиальный вопрос, ответ на который надо выудить из правил - какие действия _сколько раз_ за ход можно сделать.

Короче. Довольно сильное взаимодействие и возможность резких движений - это делает игру. Но в то же время ряд совершенно архаичных механик и нелепостей - в битвах, абилке Зевса и т.п. Механика примитивна до... безвкусия.

On the occasions we've played it (iPad plays not included) two player, I've thrown pieces at Jon and rage-lost. He suggests we traded it for that reason, but it's one of my favourite games.

Great Eurotrash crossover civilization-lite game of auctions, role selection, light civilization building and conquest. Many different paths to victory and you are almost never without a chance of winning with a few cleverly timed manoeuvres. Very hard to keep everybody else under control during the endgame.

The next game was 'Cyclades' which I feel is best described as a Greek myths and legends mini-wargame although victory stems from building a minimum of two coliseums in the basic game.  

Each player bids to win the favours of the gods in order to obtain boons from Apollo, Ares, Athena, Poseidon or Zeus towards the ultimate goal above. Players must generate income from their initial islands plus any subsequent ones plus any gained from cards during play.

Players who are outbid must replace their icon on another god which can be one that has not been sacrificed to or overbid on another one until only one player has a bid against one god. There is an element of bluff and counter bluff in this mechanic which I like.

Once the bidding process is complete, in descending order of the god tile placement (reshuffled each turn), players take actions in accordance with the favours that the god grants. Apollo grants gold and cornucopia. Ares grants soldiers. Athena grants philosophers. Poseidon grants ships. Zeus grants priests.

Soldiers wage war and capture islands. Philosophers can contribute towards building a coliseum if four are owned by one player. Ships transport soldiers and secure trading lanes. Priests reduce the cost of sacrifices when pleading with the gods.

Mythical creatures can be bought, in god sequence order, and assuming sufficient gold that can be crucial to a strategy if used correctly. This will take practice as remembering all of the powers by picture recognition can be difficult! Watch out for the kraken, the gryphon and the chimerea!

A game that shone on first plays but has dulled on subsequent plays - in large part due to the charmless victory conditions and dice based combat. Beautiful design and probably some of the best auction mechanics I ever encountered however. I sold this game but will rebuy it if given the chance if only to use the crossover expansion with Kemet and experience the auction elements again.

I think the sweet spot for this game is 4 players. Cyclades is really a clever Euro game dressed in Ameritrash clothes. I like the simplicity of the board, units and combat. The focus rather is on the auctions, which become very interesting because every round at most one player can recruit/move armies, one player can recruit/move boats, etc., so the game becomes about planning sequences of moves across several rounds and planning your economy so you can win the necessary bids to carry out your attacks/builds. The creature cards are just the right amount of chrome to shake things up and keep the game dynamic without over-complicating things. All in all a clever title I'm looking forward to playing with some regularity.. the painted miniatures of my friend's copy don't hurt either...

In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades.
\13\\13\
Victory requires respect for all the gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one god, but must pay homage to each of five gods in turn. Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the gods, as only one player can have the favor of each god per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single god per turn.
\13\\13\
* Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of Fortresses.
\13\* Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build Ports.
\13\* Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples.
\13\* Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities.
\13\* Apollo increases the income of his worshippers.

RATING: 7
A stunningly beautiful game that's just dripping with theme. The game presents a mythological Greek war, which is fought by winning auctions for the favor of five different gods. It is a strange combination of Euro abstraction and Ameritrash warmongering, that not only works; it's a lot of fun. Production values are through the roof, with the armies of each different color having their own unique sculpt and the summoned monsters that can remain in play also getting their own awesome miniature. I've only got to play it once so far, so this is a first impression rating. It could conceivably go up a point or two if it stays interesting through multiple plays, but if it doesn't I doubt I'd drop it more than a point. It played well out of the gate and It's simply too creative of a design for me to consider it a bad game.

The iconography on the creature cards is basically useless. Not a big deal, but...ugh.

Pretty much enjoy everything else. It comes to a decisive head fairly quickly, and you really have to be on your toes.

There is kingmaking, and yet I think it will work, because it isn't too preferential (that is, it's purely reactive, and you'll always choose the nearest downstream player if possible to block).

Solid Euro that I give extra points for having great components and cool plastic bits. Note that there is conflict in this game and at some point you're going to have to make a decision to attack someone, or at the very least defend against an attack.  It's almost a necessity at some point to jump on the leader in order to stall their victory at least one more turn to possibly get in your victory instead.  Still, there's plenty of ways to minimize the conflicts but don't expect to hold on to your gains unless you defend them.

[i]Rating with all the expansions added to the base game (right now I give the base game a solid 8 - it used to be a 9, but going back to the vanilla game recently made me realize that the expansions have really elevated this design to a whole new level).[/i]

First of all, this game looks stunning! The graphic design and components are a real pleasure to look at. Mechanics-wise it is a well-balanced mix of elements taken from euro and ameritrash games. The gameplay is full of player interaction. I love games that make you remember the most brilliant moves that you were able to pull off - well, this is one of those games. 

It's not a flawless game by any means (the ending is often anticlimactic), but I always have a blast playing it.

[b]/update (September 19, 2017):[/b] Once you add all the expansions (Titans, Hades and Monuments) Cyclades becomes a whole different beast. It's just fanstastic, I can't get enough of it. I used to think that the vanilla base game was amazing, but when I played it recently it felt a bit too static. The expansions add so much GREAT content that I can't see myself playing without them.

Cyclades doesn't belong to the kind of games that i like more. I played once and I lost.
I enjoyed the game VERY much.
This means Cyclades must be a VERY good game.
Wonderful theme, wonderful components.
But what i like the most is the continuous tension during all the game: you are immediately fighting for something, you know what you want but you need to struggle to get it. There were very very few actual battles, probably just 4 dice rolls, all the rest was strategy, suspence.
There's probably nothing really original in this game, all the mechanics already seen here and there, but here the mix works great !
Many strategies to follow, though decisions, good auctions, what else ?
great !
What you may not like is the fact that some time a simple throw of dice can mean the abrupt end of the game.

At it's heart this has a good o'le conquest feel to it. The 'euro' aspect of it is simply in auctioning of the gods, and the income management, which is directly tied in on how successful your conquest is.

My first 2 plays I was pretty much smothered.. so that might have dampened the enjoyment a little bit, but it doesn't change the fact that this is an excellent, fun, and challenging game!

This game has the best escalation of any game I have so far.

And in my opinion it's bad, because after short look at instruction I supposed how to win in the easiest and quickest way (but - I must confess - it was a little risky too). I don't tell that game is broken, but it's another building-game which pretends to be a war-game (like Shogun).

RATING: 9
This one's really exciting, because it has so many good aspects.  The Greek Mythological theme is tightly integrated into the gameplay.  Games can turn around quickly, where one minute someone can seemingly be in control, but then the other players can play to block any further advancement, or even steal the current advantage.  Because a player's turn actions can be performed in any order, there are often numerous possibilities in a single turn.  It is also very unpredictable, because of the random order of the Gods' appearances, and the random order of the Mythological creature cards.  Games typically end suddenly and without warning, adding to the excitement - and "masterstroke" moves are definitely likely.  The dice add some amount of luck, but not a lot since they are weighted.  The game also scales nicely from 2-5 with the adjustable board.  Overall, a really well-designed game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
By design, players are painfully limited in what they can accomplish each turn.  Often, your "action" is nothing more than obtaining a piddly extra coin (which you may or may not want) or a slick purple or white card (which you also may or may not want).

If you're lucky and your mythological signs are perfectly aligned, you may get to capitalize on last turn's fleet action to pull off the land invasion that you've planning for the past five turns.  But if not, not.

For those down with euro-trash, Cyclades is cheerfully diverting as long as the game plays in the advertised timeframe: 60 minutes or so.  At 90 minutes, I'd rather phone a stranger and chat about heart disease.  At 2 hours, I'd rather experiment with arsenic.

RATING: 8.3
Good fun! The auction mechanic leads to great competition and interaction. There is a great deal of planning, yet at the same time the game can change quickly. Nothing is certain to pan out with your strategy.  What you do at the start is interesting - do you bid for Ares or Poseidon, or go for Zeus deductions for later bidding, or for Apollo and more money. I wish Athena had more or an influence rather than philosophers and buildings - albeit she did bring several metropolises into the game. T I love the mythology in the game and the creature cards. I like the map. I look forward to reading the rule in Hades about auctioning islands.

Rules could be a little clearer (or have a index). The first run through required multiple trips to the rule book to clear issues up. You want to test something - go to my group - they can find where the problems are! 

It is hardly Ameritrash. I kind of wish there was more dice and the armies were bigger like in the original Shogun. It would be cool to then take the battles over to a tactical battle board like Titan. A cross of this with Shogun and Titan would be a super cool game. Still, I like it so much that I am going to buy the expansions.

One criticism was that people ganged up on the leader when it looked like he would win. I have seen criticism of Hades but I am hoping the power of Hades will give that leader the chance to secure his victory.

The game is a light strategy/war/euro game. A very good introductory game for war gamers. Not too brain-burny. Must accept and like diplomacy and direct confrontation though. Not for passive-aggressive/co-op type gamers.

Played one 3-player game and one 5-player game. Traded away for Shogun. 

Like: The auction mechanism is brilliantly designed and balances the game's available actions very well. The "bumping" effect which prevents a player from bidding immediately again on the same god makes strategizing for the auction very rewarding. 

The components and artwork are fantastic. The board and god tiles are beautiful and I love the miniatures. Each player's color of armies and boats has its own individual model, which is a nice touch. 

Playing the mythological creature cards is a lot of fun. The effects of each are quite interesting, and it's great that you can purchase and use the creatures even with a god that doesn't let you move your troops or ships like Athena or Zeus. 

Dislike: Cyclades is really all about the auction and economy. Player conflict is minimal and mostly unrewarding. All aspects of the game seem designed to encourage turtling. There is the ridiculous "one island" rule which prevents the conquest of a player's last island. This seems intended to prevent player elimination, but instead has the effect of ensuring that reducing a player to one island is a bad idea, since this makes the player completely invulnerable while still having a great economy due to the Apollo one island bonus (plus the accumulated bonuses from prosperity markers). Players also can't move ships and troops in the same turn, since these actions correspond to different gods. Thus (with the exception of powers provided by two of the mythological creatures) any attack comes with at least one turn's worth of warning. All of the buildings have purely defensive effects at most, with the exception of the temples. 

The mythological creatures are wildly imbalanced in relation to one another. Pegasus and the ship-moving creature are incredibly powerful, as is the Kraken, while many of the other creatures have relatively modest effects. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if Zeus did not have the ability to cycle through the creature deck once you have accumulated enough money. This leads to players saving all of their money for one big Zeus turn for the win, which can make the middle game fairly unexciting. Also it's sad that (again with the exception of the Kraken) the beautiful creature miniatures only appear on the board for at most one cycle before disappearing, leading me to question the point of even having the miniatures (especially since the actual effects of these creatures are often muted as well). 

I am not a fan of the victory condition of having two metropolises. I like having some sort of point system to assess second place, third place, etc. It also turns the last couple turns into a series of frantic episodes of everyone else at the table reducing the leader from two metropolises to one until someone arrives at a robust winning position. I don't like this style of conclusion to my games.

Overall: I really like the artwork, miniatures, and auction mechanism in Cyclades but everything else about the game is disappointing for me. I would play again if given the opportunity, but see no need to own the game.

RATING: 8
Theme/Art:
You can't go wrong with ancient Greece, the game looks amazing and the mechanics fit the theme (gaining the favour of gods and summoning mythical creatures).

Production quality:
Amazing monster miniatures and I love that every colour has different armies and ships. The quality of the armies and ships is not the best though, but it is good enough.

Replayability:
There are many ways to victory and the board changes with the number of players.

Depth/Difficulty:
It's not very hard to learn, it takes about 20 minutes to teach. However, there's a lot to consider each turn.
I weight it 3/5.

Strategy:
Since you only get the favour of one god per turn you have to plan ahead. You can't build ships and attack at the same time.

Luck:
Although you have to plan ahead a lot of things, the right creature can pop up at random anytime and change the game completely.

Cyclades takes 60-150 minutes to play, depending on the number of players and their familiarity with the game.

All in all a great game and I'm looking forward to buy and play it with expansions.

A good, confrontational game with interesting, meaningful decisions and interactions both in the auction phase and board development. I think it is probably a better game than my rating of 7, but it is just far enough askew from my game tastes/preferences that I am only "usually willing to play."

Combines a few different styles of gameplay very well. The auctioning works well, combat is simple but works, and the theme is pretty good. Also very well produced, even has different models for each color army!

I [i]did[/i] get stomped pretty early in a 2-player and had little to no chance after turn 3ish. Could be a reflection of poor play or slight early game imbalance (Ares was the offending god). 

Play with 5 was a little less interesting than I expected. There was very little conflict and a player built two metropolises kind of under the radar using philosophers for the second. I wasn't able to win Ares once and was stuck on my initial islands the whole game.

It's a hybrid bidding and area control game. There are lots of symbols on cards and the god tiles ... there's plenty of room where they could have added some text to describe the effects - even if that text were on the player shield. Unfortunately, the descriptions can only be found in the rule book. The later rounds are fun but early-on it's quite slow.

[CK]

[CK#] Collective Kingmaking
(A game state where players influence their opponents' board position so pervasively that victory is achieved by the player who the group implicitly allows to win, rather than the player who makes the best decisions.)

Is nothing sacred? Let's examine Cyclades to see just how much of a player's options and infrastructure are freely available for his opponents' to disrupt... Physical territory and gourds can be conquered. Boats, buildings, and troops can be destroyed. Money, priests, and philosophers can be stolen. A desired deity can be usurped with no possibility for the player to over-bid. (This includes turn order because the mechanic is entwined with the role selection.)

It turns out the aforementioned elements comprise Cyclades in its entirety, meaning each of your opponents can deduce your best course of action and intentionally thwart you at every junction, if they so desire. Put another way, a player cannot win unless his opponents implicitly allow his victory to take place.

The alleged balancing factor here is self-preservation; it's not directly in anybody's best interest to shaft an opponent. Consider deliberately overbidding on a deity - you pay more than the deity is worth, your opponent gets an inferior action, your other two opponents rejoice because they just spent nothing and saw two of their opponents' positions worsen. (This process is effectively like casting Hymn to Tourach on the guy to your left in a four player game of Magic.) Of course, the action is necessitated if that opponent is on the precipice of victory, and the only recourse is shaft-the-leader. While something like El Grande ends after a set number of turns, Cyclades drags on until its specific victory condition is met, and the end-game (which can come very quickly) is reduced to shaft-the-leader(s) until nobody can, or is willing. If performed to its theoretical maximum, all players begin the turn with an equal shot at the two metropolis goal and whoever goes last, or gets lucky, or is allowed will win.

Thus, a game of Cyclades will span many turns, so infrastructure cards are crucial. Apollo exceeds Zeus if you can protect the gourded island, meaning the best course of action is literally Apollo Apollo (...) Apollo Apollo Athena Athena Zeus, with a stray Ares in there somewhere. In other words, stockpile gourds on an island protected by troops purchased from Ares until you can Athena twice for a metropolis and Zeus, flushing monsters to find Pegasus - or recur it - and sending your troops to a lightly defended metropolis. (Alternatively, Athena twice more.) Problem is, thanks to collective kingmaking the best strategy won't actually work because decent opponents will overbid Athena or steal your philosophers. The futility is the same for any strategy enacted by the perceived leader. Second place has never looked so appealing, and in all honestly probably never should.

When is a war game not a war game? When it's Cyclades! Like this one a lot. Dudes on a map and action for sympathetic godly assistance. And the theme appeals.

Love the  mechanics & theme of the game.  Components are fantastic, the auction & turn based system is great, but the warfare is a bit skewed.  We found that it has to take multiple players to really mess with someone.  Some of the mechanics are too powerful and not always the person who is doing the best in the game wins.

Interesting game wiht a lot of mixed mechanics but I have to play it a lot more to have a solid opinion. It's like civilization and risk together, in a simple way and not so long to play.

Brilliant hybrid Euro/Thematic game.  Hits a lot of check boxes.  I'll pretty much always play this one, when given the chance.

I'll also say, though, that I'm NOT a big fan of the game's win-condition.  What usually happens is someone combos a bunch of cards and, out of nowhere, the game is over.  It's rather anti-climatic.  If the designers could come up with a more-satisfying end, via an expansion, Cyclades could conceivably shoot up to upper-9s territory, for me.

6 after 1 play.

Mechanic does not integrate well with theme. The board also encourages turtling and game length can therefore vary quite widely depending on how much turtling goes on. Components are high quality though.

Only played 2 player to get an idea for the flow of the game my rating would likely go up if I had the opportunity to play with more than 2. As a 2 player game it just doesn't work - one player gets ahead economically and crushes the other by locking them out of military choices. I like how straight forward and streamlined the game feels and I imagine it'd go down well with more players.

1. Fantastic mapboard. Depicts the archipelago as spied, through encircling clouds, from Mount Olympus.
2. Brilliant evocative art throughout.
3. Straightforward rules (6 pages).
4. Scales well between 2-5 players.
5. Many interesting decisions each cycle.
6. Great Clash of the Titans theme.
7. Excellent plastic miniatures - each civilisation has its own moulds!
8. Plays fast: approx 90 mins for 3 players.
9. You get to deploy the Kraken, Medusa, Cyclops, and many other mythical beasts.
10. Brutal combat.
11. Sturdy box with useful divides.
12. Multiple paths to victory.
13. Oodles of room for outthinking your friends, especially during the offering phase (bidding).

[b]THE MEDUSA:[/b]

1. Very cutthroat gameplay. If your friends don't enjoy seeing their treasure vaults raided for gold by enchanted monsters, and then that very same gold used to buy an army, which is then forced to march on their newly built Metropolis and steal it from under their noses - then open up a Euro instead.
2. Plays like a diet version of Mare Nostrum.
3. Similar, but superior to, Hellas.
4. Board is in 3 sections - which works for scaling the number of participants.
5. Offering to the gods is just a new spin on Puerto Rico's role selection, but a good spin, nethertheless.
6. Very abstract civilisation building.
7. Kingmaking is the often referred to fault of Cyclades, but that is what you could accuse most conquest games of doing. This game is no different. Yes, the rich sometimes get richer, but I believe that effective use of Apollo can mitigate this. Or, hey, plan ahead and don't invite my sword-slashing army to attack your weak, undefended island.
8. Easily mispronounced. I believe you should say: Sick-la-deez. Geekmail me if I'm wrong, please.

This may look like a conquest games... but its really all about the auctions.  It uses my favorite auction mechanic (that seen in Homesteaders and Amun-Re) and managing your wealth seems to be more important than your battle prowess... but the situation on the board leads to a second level of tension that makes the game pretty fun.  You definitely build, build, build to a sudden ending here but its fun making the journey.

A very good game that should only get better with the Hades expansion on the way. I like the fact that it doesn't take 3+ hours to play like alot of other "dudes on a map" games that are out there. The componenets of this game are all top notch and of the highest quality. I really like the art too. This game is a keeper for anyone's collection in IMO. I need to get this one to the table more often.

I feel that I should love this game because it involves some empire building wargame with a fantasy theme, yet the game always ends up being meh to me.  If you fall behind early, it's almost impossible to catch up.  Really needs 4 or 5 players.

This is essentially the first auction-style board game I have played and I absolutely love it!  The game mechanics are unique and fit exceedingly well with the theme.

The components to this game are gorgeous!  I love the artwork AND each of the races has individual sculpts to represent their military units!  How awesome is that?!

Gameplay is very exciting and rewarding!  It took a couple of games before different strategies to lead to victory became more apparent, and now it is a total head-to-head battle and race to build/obtain 2 metropolises!  This is a fun game.

Asmodee/Matagot still remains at the top of my list for fulfilling games truly in every regard.

Near perfect. Docked half a point 'cause in a 4-5 player game it can drag a little.

Very simple to play, easy-ish, decent strategic depth, great artwork, great components, lovely theme, plays well with 2-5 players and it's not too expensive.

Translation of the rulebook is ambiguous in places and the "cheat sheet" on the back of the player screens is fairly useless. I'm nitpicking, but checking the online rules for Zeus in 2p games is essential.

If you're after a light war/civ game you can't go wrong. The theme and mechanics are blended so seamlessly, it's a very slick, fun, clever game.

I love this sort of "weight" to game. Easy enough to grasp after a few turns, when I discover all the things I did wrong but can't wait to play again so I get another shot at it. Getting outbid by your opponents only for you to plan on it all along is a lot of fun.

A great game for three or four people. The god-auction mechanic really forces players to have a backup strategy to enact when they are outbid to their favourite deity.

There are a number of ways to win in Cyclades, and unless you are paying very close attention, someone will inevitably sneak into one of them; usually the one that the other players are ignoring. This game definitely rewards going against the grain with oblique strategies.

The mechanics of this game come first...
auction/bidding: works to perfection, and the competition is fierce!
worker placement: do you build this? build that? place soldiers? place boats for travel? place future financial success? every decision has to be made strategically. It's similar to worker placement, but not identical.
combat: very simple but it isn't an integral part of the game. you can focus on combat, and you'll resort to building forces plus some luck. 
X factor: monsters from Greek mythology make the intrigue in this game high. So many choices!

you can pretty much like any game mechanic and then find yourself at home with this game. The theme is amazing, the artwork is second to none and after the first time you learn it, the visual cues all over the game will lead you to a simple understanding and brisk pace.

Nice game. The bidding is cool and tactical and the meat of the game. The combat on the map lacks a bit in depth though. There are monstercards that make each game different enough each time and they add spice to the game. Verdict: I find it fun to play. 

It's definitely more of a bidding game then a conquering game. A very nice looking bidding game! 

There is an exploit in the base game were you can cycle the deck for a certain card. (solved by the expansion)

Some of the best artwork I've seen in a board game coupled with a fun and playful design. The theme is well implemented, though the game system doesn't feel particularly 'epic' but rather like numerous skirmishes over some tiny islands. (Not that this detracts from the game.) The mythological creatures and their effects are what puts the finishing touch on the game for me.

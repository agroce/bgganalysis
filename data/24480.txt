RATING: 7.8
Un juego de gestión de recursos, fácil de entender, dinámico, en el que también hay estrategias para fastidiar al contrario, y el cual es liviano, una vez sabes como se juega las partidas son rápidas, con lo que en hora u hora y media se termina una partida de 4 jugadores. Para mi el juego llega a superarse con la expansión, aunque no se juegue a 5 u 6 jugadores, le añade un plus que originalmente el juego no tiene. La expansión es obligada para hacer de este juego uno de los mejores. Para jugadores medios, no es exigente, pero si divertido. Sin expansión pierde bastante. La nota que le doy es con expansión.

Another 'worker' placement game in the mould of Keydom, Caylus or Leonardo. This one is just as interesting and results in some difficult decisions. Oh, and the book on which it is based is excellent.

RATING: 9
An Interesting game that seems to lend itself to several paths to victory.  My only complaint is that there might be a bit too much randomness, between the Master builders being drawn from a bag and the various decks of cards.  But of course this also creates game-to-game variability, which keeps it interesting.  Gorgeous artwork.

RATING: 7.5
Much better game with just three players!  The randomness of the Master Builder phase isn't has harsh and unforgiving on a bad draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Resource management, placement game with very limited actions, and some elements of randomness.

This is a decent, although somewhat light game, where on your turn you acquire resources and/or craftsmen, followed by 3 turns of placing your builders to acquire points, money, more resources, etc., and then finally at the end of the round you convert your resources into points via the use of your craftsmen.There are a few random elements such as the event cards each round (half good, half bad), the order of the builders that come out, as well as the resource, craftsmen, and special cards that are available for purchase or placement each round.My wife actually quite likes this game, I was initially a bit disappointed with it, but after several plays, I've upped my rating/opinion of it- it's accessible, yet has a decent amount of strategy, and it's short playing time (6 rounds) allows it to make it to the table more frequently.  The expansion really opens up things and adds to the replayability (and will make playing 4-players alot more manageable).  My biggest gripe now is that all of the cards (and there are alot of them, especially with the expansion) are those stupid tiny hobbit sized ones- give us some regular-sized cards for goodness sake!!!

Own the [boardgame=31753]expansion[/boardgame] set which certainly adds variablility to the game through a new board (new placements), and new cards (event and characters), and adds the ability to play up to 6 players (not sure if this is good or not).

Was initially not very impressed with this one, but had only played it with two.  With three it improves immensely, I have a feeling it will get back to the table as soon as I have three to play again.

Excellent game full of tough decisions to make. Offers lots of replayability. Having read the book already, the game implements the story very well and I could just imagine myself immersed within the story of building the cathedral at Kingsbridge while playing the game. If you have not read the book, please do! You won't regret it - in my opinion, it's one of the best books around. I like this game alot, so does the family.

A rather simple worker-placement exercise with little thematic integration. It is cube-pushing really, but with very pretty components, and a nice user-friendly ruleset. There's not much engine-building, and it's mainly played turn-by-turn as opposed to longer strategies, but all in all, it's a nice experience.

I appreciate the aesthetics of this one - it does look very nice indeed. But it's just an extreme worker placement game with 14 choices. The randomness of drawing out of the bag didn't bother me. It was instead the labor of unrolling all the placement areas that dried up the game. And I felt there were certain paths to victory, certain card combinations that were superior - the experienced player would know it and crush the newbies. Not a good thing in a game at all because it disenfranchises the new player and makes certain a short life span for the game - once you "get it", you're done.

Hmm...I think this is a very well done game.  It's got a lot to it and is finely balanced and edgy at times.  The board and pieces are nice, but it's just not really quite my thing...though I would play it again.  On first play there is such a lot going on with the cards and their powers that it's hard to take it all in.  Maybe I'll like it more on further plays, maybe not.  

My over-riding impression is that this is a fairly serviceable though bog-standard Euro.

From the Reviews: I got mixed vibes from the game and that is why I only gave this a 6.2, being a two player game that have a worker placement mechanic would make it an ok addition to my collection and I think the wife would like it since she also likes PR. It plays 2-4 and 120 minutes is a little long for me for a game that is "average" in opinion

RATING: 7.5
Simple, elegant and versatile with a nice amount of choices to establish several paths to victory. Beautiful to look at, thanks to Artist Michael Menzel, and very nice component quality .  It is simple enough for non-frequent gamers or new comers to understand, and complicated enough for gamers to enjoy.  Based on the bestselling book, this game has a similar theme to Caylus, you are a Master Builder, gathering resources in order to build the cathedral and get victory points....However this game does not have the level of complexity that Caylus offers.

Very nicely designed game about building a cathedreal. The gameplay itself if somewhat static and doesn't allow for too much variation or strategy. Also, it seems that more than half of the game consists of in-between turn evaluations.
I had hoped that the game is indeed more about building the cathedral and contributing parts of it. Instead, it is all about scoring the most points...

This is a beautiful game, and my wife and I enjoy the gameplay.  When I first played, I was surprised at how few opportunities there seemed for creative resource combinations.  Several plays later it began to feel like I was re-reading a book, and not one with much depth (which seems to match my opinions about the literary works on which it is based).  I am not sure it will have much staying power, but it certainly gives enjoyment for now, I am not sorry for having purchased it, but am ready to trade it away for something else.

I had been waiting for a long time to try this and it didn't disappointment. I would compare it (favourably) to one of my other favourites, Notre Dame, although Pillars is a bit deeper than that game. In some ways, it reminded me of a cross between Notre Dame and Power Grid, and there's nothing wrong with that. The board and artwork in general is fantastic too.

Decent for a worker placement game, but it felt far too even towards the endgame.  Options A, B and C all cost roughly the same amount and yielded exactly the same VP.  Based on my initial play, I'd rather play Stone Age.  (I know, I know, cart-horse, heresy, etc.)  Would play this one again, rating could improve (a bit), but I just don't see it yet.

I need more plays before I can make a more informed assessment of this game.  A lot of times I have a good idea how I feel about a game after one play, but that's not the case here.  There are certainly a few elements of this game that immediately jumped out at me (in a good way).  

I really like the mechanic associated with assigning the master builders.  Do you pay the cost to assign your builder right away when he is drawn from the bag to ensure you get the action you want, or do you wait until later to assign him so that doing so is free?  Money is tight, so that always makes for a tough decision.

The game is relatively simple to learn, and I think it makes for a good "gateway" game.  It didn't take us long to figure out at all, although this might reflect our experience with similar worker-placement games.

Speaking of which, this certainly bears similarities to other games out there, such as Stone Age and Caylus.  The one downside to Pillars is that I think I'd rather play these other similar games (despite liking Pillars), so I'm not sure how much it will get played.

My last observation for the moment is that the game does feel subtly monotonous to me and it might drag on for one round more than it should.  Every round feels very similar, and by the sixth round I'm ready for the game to be over.  I think 4-5 rounds would have hit the sweet spot for me in terms of game length.  However, I'm sure 6 rounds is needed for balancing purposes and to incorporate the ever-improving craftsman that are only revealed in the late rounds (I also like that element of the game--i.e. the changing quality of the craftsmen available).

UPDATE (12-06-2014): Just played a 3-player game and we all really enjoyed it.  All of us rated it around an 8.5.

I understand why it was highly rated 9 years ago but nowadays it is inferior to many other titles. Nice components but too random for it's own good. Turn order is pretty much meaningless and the first player space makes little sense as a choice. Overall nor bad but there are better choices available.

First time playing Pillars...I think this is a fun worker placement game with lots of interesting decisions.

Admittedly, I had mixed feelings about the randomness introduced into the game by "events cards," and "the draw from the bag" mechanic of the second round of worker placements in each turn.

But...was it my imagination, or was the game so well designed and play-tested that it all kind of balanced out such that you got the fun and excitement of surprises, but these surprises did not decisively determine the outcome of the game? I thought that this was the case, but I guess I would have to play Pillars again to get a better idea.

But the bottom line was that many of the mechanics, choices, and surprises seemed fun and challenging to think about...at least for fans of worker placement games like me.

"The patriarch of worker placement games" as Sam Healey put it. And he's right. Pillars of the Earth is easily one of the best produced and best designed Euro games you will find. Plus it has the innovation of drawing workers randomly from a bag to see when or if you'll place your worker first or later. Wanna place your worker first? It'll cost you. The sooner you place the more you pay but you get access to what you need sooner. Place later and it won't cost nearly as much but you may get shut out of what you want and have to settle for the left overs. The decision is yours. And as the game goes along you get characters with special abilities to help you out in future rounds. But only if you can get them soon enough. Thus paying more. Pillars plays smooth and clean without any hard to follow rules or fiddly mechanisms. This one is a must own.

Does have the Caylus placement mechanism, and ultimately is not much better than its big brother, IMHO. Rounds are a bit repetitive, the order of master builders makes a huge difference, money doesn't seem to mean much, and the last round is decisive to the point of making the first five irrelevant. Too much thought required for too little fun.

Clearly a good game...very well thought out, well organized, and quite beautiful to look at.  Due to the level of strategy, I wouldn't recommend it to people who are AP prone (nor would I recommend it to people who get frustrated with people who are AP prone).  It definitely gets easier after the first game you play.  Probably a good next step game after the gateway stage.

RATING: 7.5
This is a solid well designed game.  The pace and duration are spot on and feel very natural.  The random elements can leave you wondering what you did wrong if things don't fall your way and this is likely the biggest problem with the design.  If you can manage your money well, it should be possible to offset a bad turn of master builder draws.  Several bad turns of draws are very difficult to overcome.  Turn order can be critical, but knowing when it is important and when it is not is not easy to predict.  The game design allows for the players to control this, so there is a mechanism to offset turn order advantages.  Overall, the game gives you the feeling that you can always try another approach and it is this that ultimately keeps you coming back.

[ESP] Muy buena calidad y presentación de los componentes. Las partidas se desarrollan a lo largo de 6 turnos completos, que van 'in crescendo' en intensidad y emoción. Es en las rondas finales donde se pueden ganar la mayor parte de los puntos de victoria y por tanto la partida. Gana mucho con 4 jugadores, donde se hace patente la escasez de recursos y aumenta la competencia por las distintas opciones para situar nuestros maestros constructores.

It's a good game I think, just not for me.

The Master Builder selection from the bag seems too random for me, either giving someone a huge advantage in being able to go first and get something they really need or having someone else go last, last, last and getting none of the things that would have been useful to them.
Having a better knowledge of the cards available to take each turn could impact on my opinion some.

This is a decent worker placement game.  It is LOOSELY based on the novel of the same title.  While this game has some depth to it, I feel that the replay value is low, due to the limited deck of event and privilege cards.

The expansion does exactly what an expansion should do in a worker placement game: add more options while still keeping the board competitive.

I like the graphics and theme of the game, but the actual gameplay seems to be lacking a bit in interaction and excitement, and is rather scripted. Plays quite a bit better with four than with two.

RATING: 5
Disclaimer - I have only played 2-player, which I appreciate isn't the likely sweet spot for this game.  (We played using the restriction in available spots posted elsewhere here.)

I was distinctly underwhelmed by the game.  Although the cards increase in strength throughout the game,  there isn't really THAT much difference between one round and the next. Frankly I was bored.  I could see that a 4-plyer game would be much better, but that would take the duration of the game beyond my fun threshold.  

Bits are excellent!

After 3 plays: Fun, but I'd rather play Caylus. I don't care much for the "pull your master builder out of the bag" mechanic; I'd much rather see an auction of some kind.

Dropped my rating down a little farther... The more I play, the less I want to. I'll still play if everyone else wants to, but I won't suggest it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's an ok game. However, it's hard to classify it. It's very light if you're seeking a deep strategy worker-placement game (try Caylus instead). It's dry and heavy if you want a fast, fun, worker-placement game (try Stone Age instead). It's too simple for a deep economic engine game (try Puerto Rico or a myriad others instead), and too complex for a casual resource management game (try Blue Moon City instead).

It's a game you simply can't seem to find "the perfect time" to play it. And for a game as expensive as this one (including a worthless expensive component, and not much discount from online retailers), this is a definite no-no.

I'd play it once in a while. I would certainly not but it. Ever.

Despite initial appearances (it looks complex - it isn't)this is definately a family game. A beautifully produced and enchanting one at that! This is the antedote to El Grande in my group (a game where someone elses action can be taken, in my opinion, too personally sometimes). My experience so far has been very close and enjoyable games - no runaway leaders and low 'grumpy' factor in this one.

I enjoyed playing this one, but not enough that I'll ever be the one suggesting it.

I like this game a lot! As a Euro the game is very balanced but has an element of luck (with luck mitigation) that makes the choices in the game fun and not boring. My biggest complaint is that it tends to end in a bit of an anti-climax when it comes time to tally scores and the last turn can seem like just going through the motions.

Több ismerősöm is a Stone Age-hez hasonlította ezt a játékot. Nem ok nélkül. A nyersanyag lelőhelyek kísértetiesen hasonlók. De ennyiben ki is merül a hasonlóság szerintem. Ez a játék jóval fajsúlyosabbnak tűnik, és nekem személy szerint jobban is tetszik. Akinek a Stone Age-ben nem tetszik a kockadobálás, annak ezt tudom helyette ajánlani. Az építészek lehelyezése mint számomra új ötlet, tetszik. Az első néhány körben kialakul, ki mire specializálódik, onnantól már kicsit behatároltak a lehetőségek, de a rengeteg féle kártya miatt végig változatos marad a játék. A tábla nagyon szép! "Bármikor játszom vele" kategória. Eléggé nyelvfüggőek a kártyák, nem árt egy magyar segédletet gyártani hozzá.

Another Euro style resource gather/spend type game. Nice componants, nice artwork, almost language independant. Everything seems to be very tight all game, decisions are difficult sometimes and somethings have to be left to chance. Slightly off from normal in that their is no/very little improvement to resource gathering. The trick is to improve the resource to points efficiency. Many "similarities" to Caylus, but slightly unfair to be thought of as Caylus lite ( though its easy to spot the reasoning behind the sentiment )

It's probably a post-gateway game: not incredibly deep, but deep enough to challenge even experienced players.

The order in which Master Builders are drawn is purely luck-driven, and can turn some players off...

Out of Print (OOP).

I enjoyed how the game had 2 parts (1. selection of resources gathering, craftsman for hire as well as crusades and 2. placing of master builders) and yet they work beautifully together.

Furthermore the fact that the game is well balanced where no one gets to always place their master builder first PLUS the last master builder is ordered in a such a way that the first is last and the last is first allowed the game to be more enjoyable to all as a while.

Few rules which I always forget it that you can only have 5 resources to carry over each round and each time you fail to have enough cash to make any payment, you would subtract 1 victory for every shortfall of 2 gold.

The money track is also ingenious. I love this idea, rather than dishing out more paper currency.

it is not that quick, and the randomness is much bigger a factor than i though after first game - rank went down a little

Played once with 6 players using the expansion stuff.  I knew going in that this was going to be a very random worker placement game.  However, I had no idea that this game featured players randomly taking turns during the Master Builder phase.  In a six player game it's highly possible to be starting player and end up getting the 11th and 12th pick!  Other than being the most random worker placement game ever, I was happy and impressed with the bits.  

FYI- Pillars felt more card drafting than worker placement!  Other than acquiring resources, this game has nothing to do with Caylus.  I consider Pillars as a distant nephew of Caylus and a closer relative to either Saint Petersburg, Tribune, Leonardo da Vinci, or Age of Empires III.

The artwork in this game, specially the board, is well detailed and attractive. I enjoyed my one playing.

Update: After a 4P game in which I lost my 2d action 5/6 turns, and finished 5 points behind 1st place after leading every turn except the last, I have no desire to play this again. There simply is no need to randomly choose a player to be disadvantaged, especially when it could be repeated to ruin someone's game.

I heard the buzz about this game, read the good reports, and decided to add this game to my Christmas list.  My wife had just recently read the book, and had enjoyed it immensely.  She felt it only natural to be the one to pick up the game for me.  YES!  Great gift.  The game doesn't go on forever, but WOW, what a multitude of choices to make!  Introduced it to my game group and everyone loved it and wants to try it again soon.  I love the bidding system for the master workers but always seem short of money.  I definitely have to refine my strategy as newbies keep beating me at my own game.  Argh.  A super game to have to practice with, though.  I'm always up for it. [Gift]

This is my favourite "traditional board game" that I've played so far.
I love the breadth and depth of choices each player makes during all steps of the game. There is almost no down time for players as everybody is interested in the action at all times. Every choice is a difficult one with so many options of where to play your master builders or what to buy with your workers. 
All this combined with a lovely theme from an entertaining books makes for a masterful game.
I highly recommend the expansion which fixes some issues with worker placement and makes the game fun with all the way up to 6 players.

Aluks oli jees, keskiaika teemaa ja sillain. Parin kolmen pelin jälkeen kuitenkin totuus iski. Peli kulminoituu liikaa viimeseen kierrokseen, ja siihen, kuinka tietyt äijjät sattuu tuleen esille (tuleeko "kauppaan" vai laudalle). Vuorojärjestys vaikuttaa paljon, toki vuorojärjestykseenkin pystyy itse vaikuttamaan. Kaikkiaan hieman arpafiilis kaikesta huolimatta. (17.3.2009)

Solid game with a lot of tension and decision making. It seems however that every single mechanism was used in another game at least equally good. So it's not original enough for me to want it. Maybe if the theme meant something to me I would like it better. Still a good game to play once in a while.

This indeed does have the kind of place workers mechanic that I like about Caylus and AOEIII. It's the one where if you do something first, you are denying somebody else. Delicious.

[b]Summary[/b]
Basically you are converting three different resources into VPs. I guess the VPs represent your contributions to the Cathedral. There are 6 turns. Each turn you draw worker allocations and some craftsmen to choose from. You can spend money to get a craftsman or you can wait and claim one with one of your Master Builders. As you claim worker allocations you place your workers into one of the three resource pits.

Your workers will generate the resources that you will convert into VPs through your craftsmen. After workers are placed. The starting player reaches into the bag and begins drawing Master Builder pawns. The Master Builders don't "do" anything but claim spots on the board that will allow you improve your situation in various ways like getting a special ability, gaining immunity from bad events (insurance?), gain VPs, gain metal from the King, visit the court to avoid being taxed, acquire a craftsman, gain two workers for the next round, visit the market or become the start player.

After you've claimed these actions with your Master Builders, you resolve them in order. After resolving actions, you then decide how many resources you want to convert to VPs. It's good to save some for the next round because you'll get a chance at improving your efficiency at turning resources into VPs at a better rate. You can only save, however, up to 5 resources from one round to the next.

I really enjoy this game.  The multiple paths to victory are really nice.  I feel like it will take dozens of plays before I have experienced all the different aspects of this game.  A little long, but still very good.  My only criticism of the game is that it can really activate that Analysis-Paralysis syndrome in certain players, and that grinds the game to a halt.  Still it's very well designed and surprisingly fits the theme.

Played  once, and I like it. It is very similiar to Stone Age, and I prefer Stone Age, but I just like worker placement games so I can't give this one a lower rating than 7. Stone Age is more streamlined and I like the fact that you never know which cards and buildings will be available in that game. In Pillars, it is easy to learn exactly which cards will be available in the later turns, and that just lacks exciement for me. I think I will like this more when I try it with the expansion that adds more cards. Still, this is a very solid game.

I liked this a lot. I thought there were some tough decisions to make during the master builder phase, as well as during worker placement. It made me think, but wasn't a brain burner. A good game when you want a challenge but don't want something super heavy. The luck of the turn order during master builder placement didn't bother me at all. I kind of liked it; it added a certain tension. I do question the replayability of this one, though, because there's aren't that many cards.

[I hadn't played Caylus yet when I played this. I absolutely *love* Caylus. I'd like to play Pillars of the Earth again now and see if I still find it interesting.]

A very good game that I really enjoy playing.  I will give a couple of problems, though, since it's unfortunately easier to talk about  bad things than good things.

First, it is a pretty long game, but mercifully it does not feel as long as some other long games.

Second, it is very annoying in a 4-player game if 3 of the last 4 master builders in the bag are your own, since there really aren't that many useful positions on the board.  I think 3 players would probably be the sweet spot for this game.

Third and this is the big one for me, it feels like new players will get completely schooled by experienced players.  The same four craftsmen will always appear in each round, and knowing what will come up later is a huge advantage.  The only strategy you can have is based on information that another player could not possibly know, and that doesn't sit well with me.

Not dealbreakers though.  The second problem is only a rare problem and only with 4 players, the third is a bigger problem for me, but both [i]should[/i] be alleviated greatly with the expansion, with an extra board and extra cards to mix in with the others.  Playing with 5 or 6 players would make the first problem worse... but I'm not worried about that at this point in time.

I like it, and will happily play it pretty much anytime.  Now to see if I can give the expansion a try.

When I first played this game, it reminded me of an old adding machine where you push the buttons then pull the lever to have the machine do the calculation. THis game is just like that. Each turn has 2 phases, the set up, like pressing the buttons on an old adding machine, then performing actions based on your set up, the pulling of the lever. That doesn't mean it's not fun or enjoyable. It has some parallels to Catan and some to Age of Empires III. Does require some patience.

This game is an excellent worker placement game.  It has two types of workers (meeples and master builders).  The payment scheme and random selection and pass capabilities of the master builders is awesome.  I really like that system.  However, the game has less depth than Agricola or Caylus, and in fact the game penalizes long term planning with resource hoarding limits.  It seems to boil down to grabbing the best craftsman and privilege cards by being lucky enough to be first when they are drawn.  There is definitely tactical play in the game, but I didn't feel I was working toward something "bigger" like I do when I play Agricola and Caylus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A couple of outings so far and both have been very enjoyable. A big plus is that we rarely need to refer to the rules as the board essentially steps you through a round - useful when some games will go months between plays and you almost have to 're-learn' them.
I do wonder about its longterm replayability given the fixed order that the workers come out in, and there are threads on this site that suggest there may be some significant imbalances amongst the worker cards themselves.

RATING: 8
Rating is for two players, as I haven't played it with a larger group, and I fully expect the rating to--if nothing else--go up with more players.  Pillars features the very well conceived and enjoyable (possibly diabolical) master builder placement.  Pay-to-play, or wait it out and hope for a desired placement without cost?  Which is worth more to me, that available Craftsman or the two extra Victory Points?  How much might they be worth to my opponents?  Delicious.  Reminiscent of "Goa", in that the main choices still offer tension and challenge for only two players.  This is a title where the playable 2 - 4 range isn't short-changing those who are short one or two extra opponents.

Only one play, but I probably won't touch the game again unless someone else purposely pulls it out.  It's a good game that plays well.  The theme is pasted on and could have been anything, as the gameplay has no thematic reasoning.  But, in the end it is another bidding/worker placement game in a crowd of a lot of bidding/worker placement games.  There wasn't anything that made me think it was better than others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another worker placement game, this one is based on the Ken Follett book of the same name. Thematically one is contributing to the building of the great cathedral at Kingsbridge, but in fact you are collecting resources which then are turned in for VPs through a process of assigning workers to collect building materials (sand,  stone and wood) and then turning what you've collected into vps via craftsmen cards of increasing efficiency as the game goes along. The actual construction of the cathedral acted solely as a clock as a new piece is placed at the end of each turn (six pieces= a six turn game).

Turn order is initially random with the cost of placing your three "master builders" early (on spots which garner craftsmen or other benefit cards) being higher than if you are going later - but by going early in the placement order you are usually getting a better choice of the resource options (worker placement) and the craftsmen cards (master builders) and/or other benefits. Money was very tight in the one game I played so often you couldn't afford to go early with your builders and had to hope something decent would be left later, but you still wanted to have the better resource choices - the bottom line was turn order really matters...

About that one play. You absolutely must play this game a couple of times to avoid real bad mistakes because you don't know the pacing of the craftsmen card progression. You run the risk of paying a lot of scarce money for cards that prove not to be worth their cost (and probably explains why money was so tight for us) and high early costs are hard to recoup.

Nothing really bad to say and I would play again, but I'm not likely to purchase this based on what I've seen so far.

Totally overproduced - feels a bit like Caylus, and of course the theme is similar (build something). However this game introduces lots of randomness that you don't have in caylus. Events, might be good, might not, etc. Biggest downside for me is you can't really plan a strategy as you have little control over your selection, as the master builders are drawn from the sack. All in all the randomness overwhelms any strategy and instead you play a tactical game trying to maximise the value of each action in a turn. Caylus works for me because you can set on a strategy (collect cubes, build residence, collect cash etc), here that element is gone. Similar to Caylus in a way RailRoad Tycoon is similar to Age of Steam - and like that comparison I prefer the original. In this case I don't like the original that much either!

** Update, played again, opinion confirmed, definitely don't like this much at all - if I want to play a worker placement game with limited resources to buy stuff to get you vps type euro game I'll play Caylus over this everytime. Rating dropped a point, doubt I'll ever play this again.

I've never read Ken Follett's novel, but I quite like the game. It's good to see a game where you don't have to be intimately interested in the subject matter to have a good time.
The game is all about competing with other players for optimal placement of your pieces to maximize your resource generation to help you become the most influential builder of a Medieval cathedral. I find that with two players, the competition is reduced to a point where the game can get a little dull: you don't really need to worry about missing out on the resources you need because with only one competitor they will likely not go anywhere before they get to you. So, I would definitely recommend three or four players on this one.

Other people have said that this game reminds them of a lighter Caylus. I agree, but just because it's lighter doesn't mean that it lacks in meaningful decisions. There are still a ton of ways to propel your strategy forward and work against your opponents, and like in many euro's there is a fine line between managing your money and your victory points. With more plays, I could see this game playing in 60-90 minutes with my group, which is GREAT for the type of game it is!

Rating based on one play at BGG.CON '06.  Die Saulen der Erde is to Caylus as Railroad Tycoon is to Age of Steam.  It's not a bad game, and the components are GORGEOUS, but there's just too much BS overlaying the basic system for my taste.

This is a nice game.  There is a small learning curve, but a beginning player will be competitive with an experienced player.  The bag draw is unique and key to the game.  Each play I've learned the value of the different locations -- some that I thought were weaker showed their strength.

All three players agree that this was a great gaming experience on our first play. I am rating this for: 1) thematic enjoyment, and 2) tight gameplay with variable approaches to victory, and 3) neat mechanic of choosing to pass or pay for your actions resulting in tense choices for players. Played the expansion rule for the Master Builder placement.

Played again with 2p variant to reduce available master builder spots. Much better. It’s worker placement and resource conversion pared down to its basics. Take one (or more) of four resource types, covert these directly to victory points. Yet it manages to create difficult and meaningful decisions with these basics. Scoring is relatively low and close, so there is a nice tension. It is missing something to make it shine above many others in the genre, but very solid game.

RATING: 5
Mechanics reminiscent of Leonardo. For some reason, it plays better than Leonardo but I can't really figure out why. Production value is quite high, but I could also have done without the whole cathedral thing since functionally it's just a turn marker. I'd rather have paid less money and got a turn counter instead, but that's just me.

There is no other game board I'm aware of that is as beautifully rendered and essential to game play, as this one.  It is without a doubt, one of be best games I've been exposed to in terms of production quality.

While I admit it took me some time to get over the fact that the game has nothing at all to do with building a cathedral (it's more about generating victory points from efficient resource management), there are certain mechanics that really set this game apart - perhaps none more exemplary than the concept of paying to play (your master builders) first.

RATING: 8
Wow! I did my research before picking this up as I was on a worker placement kick, and was looking for this weight and style of game (just one that wasn't Stone Age). I am SO thrilled with this game, it is exactly what I was looking for, can't wait to get the expansion. I found foreign versions of both so they didn't cost an arm and a leg, I highly recommend this experience. Mind you, it seems that I grok these games really well, so I may love it more than most, but boy, such a great experience. Fast, rewarding, beautiful, thematic, enough interaction to engage me with my fellow cathedral-builders. Definitely one of my favorite euro's right now, glad to see this one is coming back in 2017.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice board and components, if not somewhat overproduced by the presence of the cathedral parts simply to count the rounds.

I didn't like that some superior craftsmen vastly imbalanced the game. I also didn't care for the random nature of the master builders from the bag pull.

Not feeling that this is a lighter version of Caylus; which is a far superior game.

There are superior choices for this type of game.

RATING: 8
Based loosely on the book insofar as it is about building a cathedral in the 13th century. It is a worker placement game with a board similar to stone age. Instead of dice you place a set number of workers in each area to gain a set amount of resources. Once all your plebs are out you have master builders who you can use to make more moves on the board. I love worker placements and although it is similar to Stone Age it gives a bit more depth without too much luck (no dice rolling for resources). A great game to have in any collection.

11/28/06 - After 2er, 3er and 4er games this one grows increasingly more difficult. The first player option might seem like a waste of a master builder but in those later rounds it is important to grab those more efficient craftsmen. Be sure to watch your cashflow in this game as well - really good balance, resource management game. In all the games played so far I have always been faced with relatively tough choices when having to place the master builders. In 4er games sometimes you have no choice especially if you haven't taken heed to your cashflow and your master builders get drawn early. Many things to keep track of in this game and not an easy game with 4ers.

Moved along quickly once it was grasped.  I wonder about longevity of this title, but it seemed interesting enough.  I'm afraid there may be a little too much solitaire play here, but I'm willing to play it again.

I've played again, and I'm still worried about the longevity.  It seems the luck in the game hits you at crucial moments, which have the ability to severely disrupt your goals.  This is the wrong balance of skill and luck, and hits me wrong.  I'm still willing for another go, to see if it works itself out.

RATING: 6
Taking my rating down one now that Stone Age is out.  I think Stone Age fills the "Caylus Lite" bill (i.e., lower complexity worker placement game) better than Pillars.  I haven't played Pillars with the expansion.  Maybe it improves the game, but I'm not willing to spend the money to find out.  
===========
Caylus lite.  I like it, but the random factors can really screw you.  When 2 of the 3 resource production cards for a given resource are out of play, anyone relying on that resource gets majorly screwed.  Having a balanced VP production engine helps you to avoid that problem, but you will lose every time to the player who optimizes on one resource and gets lucky with that resource always being available.  I would rather play Caylus.

RATING: 8
Fantastic! Tough decisions to be made each step of the way. Multiple resource allocation decisions. Nice economic engine that improves as the game goes along. Many different approaches to pick up points. Various strategies to victory. Just the right amount of luck-of-the-draw for my taste.

Thanks to Mike (last name?) at the Eugene Gala for introducing and explaining the rules. I think this is a solid purchase, even if you don't speak German, so long as you download the instructions. I'm not sure if all of the cards are translated to english for download... It would have been nice to have included an english rule sheet.

I like this a lot. In our first game, we basically played randomly for the first few rounds. But by halfway through, I finally understood what you should be trying to do in each round (basically, gather the building materials for your craftsmen). My ability to plan for the longer term is still nonexistent, but oh well.

I don't have a problem with the random draw of the master builders (in fact, I think that mechanic is quite ingenious), but I [i]do[/i] have a problem with the random events. Aside from placing a master builder in the bishop's seat, how do you prepare for those events? Does your planning have to account for the chance that ANY of them could come up? That seems absurd. And yet a single event could scuttle your careful allocation of resources for the round. In fact, the event for the last round in our first game deprived my wife of about 10 points (though she won anyway).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My initial reaction is very positive - it plays pretty smoothly and is challenging enough without being too demanding on the old grey matter and, I'm glad to say, without any overly complex rules.  The Cathedral pieces as game round markers are gloriously, pointlessly, overproduced - I do like that too.

As I've played Pillars some more, I've become more comfortable with the game and more comfortable with my 8 rating. I might even kick it up to a 9 at some point for the combined basic/expansion 4-player game; I think the expansion really helps in giving a little more variety to the flow of craftspeople, which I think is a legitimate complaint about the "basic" game.

Another win for Pillars is that as I've played, I've become more attracted to the theme. The "building a castle/church/cathedral" has become such  a staple of unimaginative game themes, it was easy to instinctively put Pillars in that category. But I think it's actually much better than that. As you start with low-VP masons laying the foundations and progress to high-VP sculptors and bell-makers, the game has a nice, evocative arc. The gorgeous presentation helps a lot too.
--
I've played Pillars of the Earth a few more times recently, and it's been growing on me. Part of this may be the fact that it's simply better and more interesting than the raft of mediocre-to-awful worker-placement type games we've seen of late (Kingsburg comes immediately to mind), and so by comparison it looks good. No question it's a tight, well-executed game, which most games these days are not. But there is a part of me that won't let me rate it an 8 because of a sneaking suspicion that a lot of the enjoyment for me is that I literally win this game all the time. The only time I lost was the very first game in which we played the rules wrong. I kid you not, in the last half-dozen games I have played, I have not lost and it has rarely been close. Fun for me, but I'm fairly sure I win just because I've played more - I'm not convinced there is much of a range of viable strategies.

OK, what the hell, I'll give it an 8.

I've since played some more, and come to like the game a little better. Not enough to kick it up to an 8, but it's fun, and right on the bubble for me between a "buy/not-a-buy", so since I'm trying to buy fewer games, I'll try not buying it, see how that works out, unless I can find one in a fire sale somewhere. I think the luck of the draw in the master builders and the events is just a bit too heavy, and the game is a bit too scripted with the prescribed progression of craftspeople. It's still a decent game, but there are similar, related games (like Aladdin's Dragons) that are just more fun. Given the choice between this and Caylus, though, I'll take this any day.
---
UPDATE: Pillars has now almost (but not quite) reached nickel status, and I have to say I'm glad to play it from time to time but also glad I didn't buy it.  The game just lacks real tension and variability. It's well put-together and plays well, but it just doesn't have any edge. Compared to the recent Phoenicia, Phoenicia is a far more compelling game that does more with less. Like Phoenicia, though, one thing one has to give Pillars of the Earth credit for is that it's a basically economic game that doesn't have any sort of runaway leader/compound interest problem. Anyway, nice, but I like my games a little edgier.

I like games like this where you're slowly ramping up your output throughout the game.  I kind of like the master builder phase of the game, where you're never sure what order the master builders will come out, and usually have a tough decision to make as to where to put them.  However, while this mechanic provides for some tense moments, it can be frustrating at the same time as the cards you're making your points engine out of are fairly scarce, so you can really get boned out of a card you needed simply because your builder didn't get drawn.  Overall, I like this game alright but there are other games in the genre I'd rather play.

[22/12/06] 'Die Säulen der Erde' bears more than a passing resemblance to Caylus and is often described as 'Caylus light' for good reason.I feel the game lacks balance since there are certain craftsmen who vastly superior. This railroads the game to the such a point that one begins to question whether the game's driving the action rather than the player himself. The tension and uncertainty witnessed in Caylus regarding your allocation of resources isn't quite there in this game, particularly as the disproportionate element of luck and lacking board development hamper this.Cathedral theme is a letdown. I regret the Building the cathedral itself is a mere VP track and the various cathedral pieces merely serve as a turn marker. The remarkable artwork rather than the mechanics is the main theme vehicle.Gameplay is IMO too ponderous, unoriginal, calculational and lacking sufficient direct interaction for it to be really a game I'd choose to play with family or casual gamers. With gaming ethusiasts on the other hand, I cannot see how I'd suggest Säulen der Erde over Caylus.I hope this isn't given the SdJ prize. That'd be a disservice to German families and casual gamers. Fortunately, I believe the jury will realise this.

2 Years later I got to play again.  I really enjoyed it, but having played so many worker placement games in the interim I can see my 9 rating needs to be earned more.  For such a complex game I think it actually has very simple mechanics.  I want to play a lot more and get towards a 9.  I cannot see this ever being one of my '10' games.  Marked down to 8.

I gave this game the same rating as On the Underground, because I feel the same way when playing each of them.  I would like to believe that each of these games has a depth, especially with 2 or 3 players.  However, with the high end of players, the random elements in the game decide way too much.  Pillars with 2 or 3 is fantastic, because the planning dominates the randomness.  If the 4 player game was better, this would be a top-5 game for me.

[u]July 2007:[/u] I've loved some things and a lot less other things. Finally after 3 games, I think I'll never really like this one because of the luck factor being too high.

Of the things I loved: the fact that you always had the choice between paying a lot to get the good spaces or nothing to get the leftovers.

I didn't like because it was too luck dependent and there didn't seem to be any kind of real long term planning involved (you can plan ahead but the luck factor is a bit too high for good planification and forces you to "stay in the middle", there is no real possibilities for very differenciated strategies, which is too bad in my book.

RATING: 6.5
This was one of the first worker placement games I tried and I liked it a lot. I discovered the awesome world of WP games/ressource collecting->transforming into VP.
Since PotE I have played other better WP games which has caused me to downgrade PotE a bit, but it's still a good game. I like the luck aspect in it when drawing your master builders (though, admittedly, you can get screwed) and that different ressource cards appear every round so you cannot know for sure which ressources will be available. The artwork is gorgeous which definitely helps when introducing it to new players. 

However, there are some drawbacks: it seems like some of the craftsmen are better than others; the 1 wood for 4 gold is overpowered and if you get that card it seems like you have a distinct advantage in the game. Also, my games have been won with the metal craftsmen which seem quite strong, though the sculptors (stone) are great too. It's not impossible to win without having any metal, but in my experience it's going to be tough!

Furthermore, PotE isn't really for 2 players as there is not much tension as there are always decent spots to place your master builders on, but with 4 (and probably 3) it's a very classic light worker placement game in which you get ressource cubes and transform them into victory points.

RATING: 6
A worker placement game which ties in thematically with the book. The mechanics are not particularly new but work well and provide lots of viable paths to victory. The luck of the draw plays a significant part in whether you can grab the vital cards and roles but is somewhat balanced by the initial high cost of early choices.

Great game; the first play (3 players) seemed a little overwhelming, but the second play (2 players) improved my opinion greatly.  Some of the devices in the game add a good amount of fun into it, and the decisions are very difficult.  Not sure what I would think of it with 4 players.  In my two games, it seemed that nobody picked the startplayer option very much, but that would probably be very different with 4.  Also, with 4, there would be some pretty poor choices left to the last player, I think.

Way too long and much too complicated for what it does.  You fight for cards which are your engine and you fight for resources - that you turn into victory points via the cards.  There are some twists and special powers along the way but that is the gist of it. Add in the turn order being random via drawing workers from a bag and it's not all that fantastic for the length.  It's not horrible - but its not as awesome as the cathedral bits that act only as a turn marker.

I had traded for Pillars because I was looking for an approachable worker placement game. The other options I had (Dominant Species, Age of Empires III, etc.) were too heavy for lighter gamers.

After one play, I'm fairly impressed. The game is easy to pick up, the rounds progress smoothly, everything moves fluidly. This is leaps and bounds better than something like Stone Age.

At the same time, I personally find it enjoyable but nothing earth shattering. Whether or not this stays in my collection will largely depend on if I find an audience of more casual gamers. 

Update: a second play, and I expect I will trade this away. It's an OK game, but it is stuck in some purgatory between too complex for "gateway worker placement game," but not interesting enough for my fellow gamers. I'd have to lobby hard to get this to the table, and I'm not interested enough in the game to do that.

Update: ...and yes, I successfully traded this away for Pandemic: Legacy.

I was put off by to many comparisons to Caylus. Yes, it is a worker placement game like Caylus or Keythedral and it has a similar theme to those games. However, it is very much its own game and not Caylus lite. It has randomness in the craftsmen draw but it has both the cathedral ability to make yourself the first player and the master builder dial to offset this. And it is one of the best looking games ever.

We played this game at 4 and found it very interesting, however  I think it will need a second go before I can make any real decisions on the play.

Based on my single play through, the game is slow, tedious, opaque, and boring.  You spend a large amount of time moving small wooden cubes around and picking moves at random.

I played the German version, and didn't know the rules. I figured that I could deduce the rules as we played. I think for the most part it wasn't so difficult to do. I did come in last, but then I couln't read German either. I took a number of cards that cost me - like I kept taking too many workers. Now, of course I learned the worker rule after I had done this several times. I think I could do well in my second game without any rules explanation.

Also I thought the cathedral was a waste. It doesn't even look like a cathedral.

This game sort of reminds me of games like Manilla or Caylus in that the players take turns placing markers on the board to take control of various options available. Unlike Caylus, and like Manilla, there is some significant randomness during the game. It's not the best game and it's not one I would necessarily seek out again but I might play it if I'm in the mood to humor someone.

A very nice family strategy game. Some mechanisms reminded me of Caylus, others of Power Grid, but The Pillars of the Earth is less complex and more forgiving (it's a family game, after all).

I don't mind the randomness of the cards but the randomness of how the master builders get into play each round is a bit too much for me, and I would have preferred a turn order mechanic similar to the one used in Caylus.

What a shame that the building of the cathedral merely serves as a round marker rather than being part of the game play mechanics as it is the case in Elasund for example.

Absolutely gorgeous artwork. Should you ever burn out on it (and this may well happen if you play it too often, as it has a much lower replay value than, say, Caylus or Power Grid), just hang the board on the wall.

I rate it an 8 if played with the expansion, but just a 7 without it. I wouldn't want to play a 4-player game without the extra board any more, and the extra cards do add some variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Wow, this one was a bitter disappointment. I've read the novel and thought that the worker placement mechanic would be enjoyable. 

It COULD work, but I found myself really distracted by the turn-order bag draw. I understand that this supposedly is balanced by the decreasing cost of the actions, but I don't think it sufficiently balances anything. It feels like too much of the game is interrupted by this chaos, which detracts from the game-play. This in turn makes the game much more tactical than strategic, although an intimate knowledge of the cards does allow for some strategic planning....but whether the cards come available as actions or for purchase can dramatically change things.

You're forced to have so much flexibility that luck ends up being injected far too much.  Ultimately, if you get shafted on the draw bag, there is no mechanism to compensate and keep you in the game. I don't mind luck in games, but this design is at odds with that type of luck issue.

Säulen...this was not a game that I was in any particular hurry to play. Early reports came back that it was a Caylus variant with more randomness, and after having played it, I will confirm that analysis.

This is another game in the "you have limited resources with which to get other resources which can then be turned into victory points". Worker pieces are placed to get raw materials, and then your 3 special, larger workers can net you other privileges like tax evasion and better position in the turn order. The value of the resource cubes is driven by personality cards that you can draft and or purchase during the course of the game which essentially improve your victory point conversion rate. So an early personality might be able to get you 1 VP for 2 a given type of cube, a later one might be able to give you 1 VP for 1 of a given cube, and so forth. This is one part of the game where it felt more like Louis XIV rip off than a Caylus one (i.e.: the special power cards that players accrue), but again, I think the original game did it much better. There is also a money economy grafted onto the system, and that is combined with a strange random order selection, where player pieces are randomly drawn from a sack, and then that person has the right to either pay the current rate (which starts out very high) or to delay that worker's action until later in the round. This is a game like Caylus in that trying to explain it in a clean way is nigh impossible.

So I still like Caylus, and I found this to be almost completely derivative, with the changes all being for the worse. There is a significant random aspect in the timing of the personality cards arrival, in the "events" deck, and in the order the pieces are drawn out of the cloth bag. The bottom line then is this: if this was a new game, and Caylus didn't exist, it would probably rate decently because the system works in spite of all the shortcomings, but because Caylus does exist, I see absolutely zero reason to ever pull this out...it's simply a shorter, more random version of the same basic concept. Frankly, I find the lack of innovation here mildly offensive...scratch that, quite offensive. Given that I don't even think Caylus does the system best at this point (...Agricola) this is getting pretty far down the list of "action drafting" games for me...probably my least favourite honestly. I have no intention of ever playing this again.

This is a beautiful game. I am impressed by how well the theme of the book related elements are tied into the game appropriately. I liked the components and the board and cards have excellent artwork throughout. Also being in the middle of reading the book for the first time added a lot to the feel of it. The characters were more than just names and faces on the cards.

The game left me feeling a little bit undecided as to whether it will become a favourite or just be a very good game. The first game confusion of not knowing the relative values of things or the pace and acceleration of the victory point production made it hard for me to assess how well it worked as a game for strategising. I thought I had gone for VPs too early with Prior Phillip and many direct points from his specialty area at the expense of getting craftsmen who were efficient. As it turned out I won after some fortunate finishing moves - getting the bellmaker and both final round special cards with free metal for all players from the previous rounds event card. This meant that though I lead throughout the whole game the feeling that I was going to be hauled in and come last did not eventuate and I won with a little space to spare. It helped (me anyway) that OzGamer who came second had a particularly disasterous last round as I kept taking all the things he wanted. Without the very lucky / very unlucky last round I thnk I would have been a contender for last place. 
This might become a favourite but it did seem a little too luck based and chaotic for strong planning and strategy. Not exceedingly so but enough to think that smart play can often be eroded by bad luck.

Second game. Again I was surprised to win and don't feel like I played well. 

Aquired with expansion in maths trade for Power Grid.

Ma 3-an kipróbáltuk. Nem volt vele semmi gond. De sokkal többet vártam tőle. Nem volt benne semmiféle fejlődés, nem éreztem, hogy azért épülne a katedrális, mert én dolgozok rajta. Én csak gyűjtöttem nyersanyagot, amit aztán vagy pénzre váltottam - amiből általában újabb nyersanyagokat vettem - vagy átalakítottam győzelmi pontra. Még azt sem lehet mondani, hogy azért negatív a véleményem, mert nem volt sikerélményem: 3 ponttal maradtam le az 1. helyezettől.

A játék kártyái, képei nagyon szépek. A játéktábla túl zsúfolt, és a játék egyetlen előnye más játékokkal szemben, hogy itt tényleg épül egy 3d-s katedrális. Ellenben a mechanizmus gyenge - bár amit nyújt azt jól csinálja, tehát a mechanizmuson belül nincsenek hibák. De nekem ez kevés volt egy ennyire felkapott és jónak ítélt játékhoz... Ez van.

Azért ha előkerül szívesen játszok vele máskor is, de csalódás volt.

Got this game back on the table after about 5 years and I have to say: It is still a good one. Usually I try to stay away from games that carry a franchise title because in my experience, 19 out of 20 of those games are not worth the cardboard they are printed on. The Pillars of the Earth is one of the few exceptions. Rules and components are well done as you would expect from a KOSMOS game and the game's worker placement mechanics work perfectly despite the strong theme they were built around (actually I don't know if this was the case or if theme and mechanism just happened to fit). In fact, the theme doesn't even bother me and this is probably the only game I like despite it's theme: I tried to read the novel (twice) after I played the game but I disliked it's triviality so much that I never read more than half of it before it got too boring to continue. But neither not knowing anything at all about the game's background theme nor disliking it has ever prevented the game from appealing to me. Of course there are recognizable persons and places but if you don't know them they are as good as any other random names. I have often used this game as an entry game for gamers who never played any complex games before but wanted to experience something more than Monopoly, Memory and Rummy had to offer - The Pillars of the Earth does a great job at that. (This is for the German KOSMOS (2006) edition.)

The first thing everyone noticed was the pretty board. Some similarities to Caylus were mentioned (which was also being played 2 player at the same time between Oren and Wade), and I guess I see that. It also felt a little like the more recent Leonardo Di Vinci in that you have workers, and you choose where to allocate them, which nets you resources. You then use workers (recipes) to turn resources into points. Interestingly, the board serves very little purpose in the game. It just has places to put stuff without much special significance. I never did quite figure out the ideal dollar/points ratio. It seems like knowing this would be very useful. I only had one minor nit with the game (still a good game as is), and would be interested in trying one of two slight modifications just for comparison. Variant 1: when someone pays to place, do not leave a gap; instead draw another pawn at the same number. Variant 2: when drawing pawns, pull two pawns per space. This means that no one gets to place for free until all pawns have been drawn. Variant 2.1: like variant 2, but draw both pawns for a number, and before the first one makes any decision, the second one can make an offer of money and/or cubes to go first. The player with the first pawn can accept it and be 2nd at the number, or reject it and still be 1st. Variant 1 is simplest, and would certainly go a long away to assuaging my bemoaning of someone else getting to place all three of their pawns for free before I got to place any of mine for free, while variant 2.1 would address the end-game issue we had where two players both desperately wanted to be picked first (willing to pay any price) just to be able to pick the card we both needed with no way to influence our order.

Reminds a little of Caylus but compares unfavorably.  Typical Euro game with a collection of mechanisms associate with a somewhat pasted-on theme.

Good family game and a great primer for the heavier worker placement games.  The more I play it, the less it appeals to me.  However, it is light enough to get others to play it with me.  Prefer Caylus, Age of Empires III, Leonardo and Stone Age.

Great game with a lot of interesting decisions. The theme is exellent and the game design and artwork is amazing and really adds to the experience. I like this game a lot. It probably shines the most when played with 4 or more players (4-6 with the expansion). The one 2 player game ive played wasnt very exiting at all. I really hope to play this game a lot more than ive done so far.

Components: Gorgeous board. The text on the board could be clearer, or at least have the corresponding numbers be larger. The cubes are great, as are the master builders and workers. The exclamation mark on the starting craftsmen is insufficient to indicate their added bonuses, which we overlooked and assumed were just rules of the game.

Experience: Hmm. Seems like a lot of pushing cubes around. Let's work backward. I'm trying to get points, and the main way to get points is to get cubes, and the main way to get cubes is to send workers to gather materials. The rest is somewhat interesting window dressing, to upgrade to better craftsmen; to get more money to be able to afford to upgrade to better craftsmen; to get special privileges; etc. I think there might be a little too much going on. Although I enjoy Agricola, I'm definitely more in my comfort zone with the relatively transparent operations of Stone Age. Pillars of the Earth feels pretty fiddley to me.

With only two players, it didn't seem to matter much whether we specialized. Specializing in a particular resource just means my opponent no longer has competition for the other resources.

I like that the privileges and events available each game are random. The same should be true for the craftsmen (i.e. not all craftsmen should be available each game).

I'll definitely try it again (partly because I own it, and partly because the board is so attractive), but so far I'm disappointed.

I heard about this book on the radio from John Gormley.  Then I saw there was a game based on the book.  That's a bit different.  I bought the book first, 1000 pages long.  I didn't allow myself to buy the game until I finished the book.  It was the best novel I read that year, even though it took me several months to read it.  The game is true to the theme of the book.  Most of the people I have played this with know nothing about the book, so they are missing out on the connections between the book and the game.  I haven't yet watched the miniseries with Donald Sutherland, but I intend to some day.
This is a worker placement game.  Easy to learn, but there's a lot going on in the game.

When I first played this, I was so impressed I bought the game. It's light the luck element has the potential to totally screw you, but it gives you plenty to think about without being totally brainburning. The expansion even improves it.

That said, as time has gone by the shine has somewhat gone off the game.

RATING: 9
Excellent resource management game that's not too much of a brain burner as other games can become in the same genre.  The only reason I don't score it a 10 is because the random drawing of the master builders feels frustrating and can arbitarily swing a game (and there's only minor tactics to employ to influence the random draws, i.e. being start player and opting to redraw).

Solid resource management game that is well-themed and easy to learn. I think there was just enough luck worked into it to keep the uber-geeks from working out an 'always wins' strategy (and subsequently complaining that the game is broken). Also, nice looking board and smooth gameplay.

RATING: 7
Stronger worker placement games have come along in the past 6 years to make this game feel more like an also-ran. That said, a perfectly decent game for its simple mechanisms. Just not quite enough interesting decisions -- I have the expansion, though (not yet played), which is well regarded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rating after two plays, is likely to climb.  Appears to be a complex game at first but is actually quite simple.  Figure out the best way to create victory points and manage the small amounts of randomness that happen.  That randomness makes the game much more enjoyable, IMO.  Lots of decisions to be made, playing time is just right, so if you are falling behind you don't have to put up with another 2 hours of losing.

Dec. 30, 2010: I'm not ready to rate this yet. I got this game a few weeks before Christmas, and I played a half game with my wife , using one of the 2-player variants I found in a forum. It seemed just ok to me at the time, but it was late and we were both tired--hence the reason for only playing half a game. Then, for Christmas, I got Stone Age and absolutely loved it; my wife did too. Stone Age felt like you were constantly developing, while Pillars seemed repetitive from round to round. I do like some of the mechanics of the game, and the board is one of the most beautiful ones I own. I'll give it another try sometime. If this game doesn't work out for me, maybe I'll frame the board and hang it in the gameroom.

Borrows some mechanics from Leonardo Da Vinci for worker placements and some ideas from Caylus, but it blends them in a nice mix with a great board and theme (though the cathedral as the round-counter isn't nice at all...). It has that master-extraction from the sack that is unbalanced (read: luck element). But with the exp it's now ok (though the luck factor still remains).

The Pillars of the Earth is a good worker placement game. There's just something missing here, and that is the sense of actually building something. Sure, the cathedral is there but it will be built anyway no matter how many points you get. Agricola is better but this is not bad.

One of the trendsetting games and it does that very well. The artwork from Michael Menzel is awesome as usual and the gameplay after the first round smooth and quite profound. Just being a bit afraid for replayability for the craftsmen always come in somewhat the same order.

RATING: 6
Ok worker placement game, but pretty bland. Only the prettiness of the art and pieces elevate it above the many others like it. I used to think the expansion made it better (it certainly helps lower the heavy luck of the base game) but it also makes it longer, and the game isn't interesting enough to support the extra length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an excellent game full of tough decisions at the Master Builder Phase.  I do think that it needs more craftsmen cards to add to the variability, because once you have played it a couple of times you know what is coming up and the first few craftsmen are largely meaningless.  Beautiful artwork, interesting choices, great theme.

A good game that reminds me more of [gameid=4099] or [gameid=21920] than it does of [gameid=18602], but your mileage my vary. Interesting decisions. The cathedral-building aspect is less than it could have been, since it amounts to little less than a turn indicator, but that's not a deal-breaker. Some have complained about the randomness of the draw, and it is a valid complaint, but it doesn't ruin the game for me. I enjoy the game and am still willing to play it when it is suggested.

Lots of choices to make, but the theme doesn't work for me.  It doesn't feel like we are actually building anything.  Feels like lots of activities to maximize VP.  Players who have played before have a significant advantage in knowing the future cards that come up in later rounds.

Hint for beginners, horde resources early.  Cash them out a little later in the game when the resource to VP ratios improve.  Don't worry about VP in the early turns, focus on building up money and resources.  Getting the trades people early who produce resources is valuable, especially the one that gives you a stone a turn.  The seer that let's you see the events is moderately valuable.

Wow, what a cool game.  Sort of like Age of Empires 3, but less complicated.  I very much like that, once you gotten a round or two under your belt, the game flows along very smooth and quick.  Also, the rules are put together very well.  There is very little room for  misunderstanding, which means that very little time is spent arguing over interpretation.  Another plus is that there are only 6 rounds of play, and the game ends.  That way, it doesn't drag on for a long time.  I am liking this game more every time I play it.  I can't wait for the 5-6 player expansion.  That will allow this game to hit the table much more often on our game nights.

 The bits are wooden, and fairly ordinary (except for the Cathedral), but the cards are beautifully printed, and the board is absolutely gorgeous!  This game will definitely see some action at our game nights. 

Another sad tale of no plays and limited space.  This got traded away.

Good complexity, effective period atmosphere, fun interplay between players.  it's a fantastic game, but the one flaw is after playing three or four times you know exactly what you need to do and what resources to save for late in the game.

This is a great game where you have to compete for scarce resources, utilize craftsmen to convert resources into money and victory points. Some tension is thrown in by the game mechanic of drawing the next person to place a master builder on an action space from a bag.

RATING: 7
It's a lot like Caylus but has more luck.  The worker-position and craftsmen are selected via draft.  The workers are used to generate cubes and the craftsmen are cards that basically give you your exchange rate in terms of cubes/victory-points.  However, players' builders (which compare to Caylus' workers) are pulled randomly out of a bag.  So especially you have to rely on a bit of luck to get the optimal spots on the board. Even going first does not guarantee that you won't get unlucky and get the worst 3 spots.  This can be harsh on the last turn and can flat out decide a game.  To me, that's the main weakness in an otherwise excellent game.  I give it a 7 because the game is a lot of fun and I think I would usually be willing to play.

RATING: 7
Beautifully presented game.  Players own a tribe or workers and craftsmen, and use them to turn coloured wooden cubes, and money, into victory points.  It's set against the backdrop of constructing a 12th century cathedral, which essentially is the game clock and start player marker.  A typical turn is workers head out and bring in money and goods (staples such as sand, rock and wood).  Then master builders are drawn randomly from a bag and allocated to a role for the turn.  Roles include visiting the King's Court for tax protection and a lump of metal, the market for more trading, etc.  Then the roles are resolved in ordered fashion, culminating in converting goods into other goods and the important victory points.  Quite a bit going on, but plays cleanly and quickly (probably 75 minutes once you've seen it), with that sharp pain of turn angst.  I'm not quite sure about the random drawing bit for the master builders... that may be a bit too random, but the game works well and should be good for a few more plays.

In fact, I can sum up my feelings in exactly the same language as my comments for Notre Dame: "Yet another dry game based on creating a simple economic engine that is reduced to cubes. Little interaction, unthematic, hollow. The original Puerto Rico runs circles around it, even though I'm a bit burned out on it." 
 
Okay, so it's a hair better than Notre Dame and has more in common with the lame-er Caylus, but still, a chore with little fun and lots of luck and no clever to be found.

This game feels very much like a cross between Stone Age and Caylus to me. Much simpler than Caylus though; about as weighty as Stone Age. Yet I like this one a lot. I don't know if it's because I have read and loved the book or if it's because the game is so good. This game does feel like it stays true to the book though reading the book is not at all necessary to play the game. Perhaps the book really is just about building a Cathedral. At any rate, this game is relatively simple in terms of the rules but there is still enough variety of choices in each of the phases to keep the game interesting.

RATING: 7.55
One of the better, light worker placement games with ingenious mechanic for worker order selection. The game feels a bit scripted with having limited set of variables so it seems that it has limited number of replays (like [b]Agricola[/b] without occupations nor minor improvements). The board and the art is beautiful though.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] When placing workers they are first pulled out of the bag, then the player whose worker color is extracted chooses to pay a lot to play that worker immediately or to play it later for free. Then the price lowers and the next worker is pulled out etc. The first player has a choice of veto: to exchange the worker he just pulled out for another one in the bag, once.

The bits and board are of high value, and the artwork is gorgeous. The game is quite good, although I positively suck at this :). The cards are small, but necessarily so, since they are put on the board and around it. Setup and maintenance is a pain, though.

Eh. Not my bag. The final round outweighs everything that comes before, and randomness plays a bit too much of a role. Perhaps if we were playing it with English rules and components, it would have gone fast enough that I would have cared less about the randomness. As it was - I'll give it a pass.

Fair.  As far as worker placement goes, I like it more than Agricola and Stone Age but less than Caylus.  It lacks the annoying "feed people or you're hosed" feature of the first two, but doesn't quite have the depth of the latter.  It feels like a warmed-over retread of the same themes, with even more gamey-ness added.

This a beautiful looking game, but I don't like the use of the draw bag.  In my 4-player game, there were usually two or three actions available each turn that were significantly better than the others, and it doesn't sit well with me that a random drawing determines which player(s) get to take those actions.  I don't mind a little luck in games, but it feels overpowering here.  0-1

RATING: 7
Solid resource management, worker placement game. Pulling workers out of the bag can simultaneously be very exciting as well as frustrating; it's certainly an interesting mechanic and not something I've not seen in other games. After a few more plays I'll have a better understanding of the events and craftsmen, likely leading to higher scores.

This one might get a little undeserved hype due to the dice tower and being out of print. It's a solid game but I prefer other (newer) worker placement games of similar weight (e.g. Stone Age, Lords of Waterdeep, Viticulture, etc.).

A great worker placement Euro that I love because it doesn't try to be anything else. It's super pure and to the point, without any extra fiddly things. Would love to play with with 3 or 4 players for a bit more interaction, but 2 players is not that bad. Thumbs up.

Update: after playing this a few more times, I am bumping my rating on this up to a nine. What an excellent game.

I like this one a lot. It has more randomness than most "economic machine" games which makes it a bit more interesting. It's also a lot less screw-your-neighbor than games like Puerto Rico or Caylus, which is a definite plus in my book. The craftsman placement alone is an interesting exercise is waiting out your opponents.

The bad part: if you dislike drafting (here's a row of cards: pick one and then I'll pick one) forget it.

We have yet another worker placement game.  Luck plays a role in this game, which I can live with but I feel is better handled in Stone Age.  What I mean by this is that the luck can be mitigated more in Stone Age most of the time.  I really don't like the luck involved with the drawing of the Master Builders and while I'm aware there is a variant in the expansion to address this I don't like the game enough to purchase it.  I feel you also have more control in Stone Age, for example trying to burn through a building stack to end the game.  In Pillars I don't feel like you have a lot of choices because the optimal one is usually apparent.  Some of the Privileges don't seem balanced.  This a lot of negative comments for something of this rating.  The reason being is that if I had played this before other games of it's ilk I would probably consider it's mechanisms novel and pretty fun regardless.  There are just a lot better options in the worker placement genre these days.

This is a very smooth game with great art and good components. The way the board, rounds, and phases are designed make this an easy game to teach and learn. However, there simply isn't enough variety in the cards to provide a lot of replayability. It looks like the expansion adds a number of new cards (as well as a fifth and sixth player), and some great new features. Unfortunately, because it's been out of print for so long, I haven't been able to try it. If it is ever printed again, I will buy it as soon as I find out about the reprint!

RATING: 9
An excellent offering that comes as a surprise when looks at the very few succesful book/film tie-ins that are out there (and especially Kosmos' speckled history in that respect). In fact the game mostly avoids a close representation of the book, which mostly is some flair text on the cards (and there is very little flair text). This is simply a very delightful and challenging game for gamers, with more than a passing resemblance to Caylus but with some aspects that make the game actually more accessible and even more forgiving. The different phases work very beautifully together, there is no downtime as all phases are interactive and the game also doesn't overstay it's welcome but is engrossing up to the end. The fancy turn counter (the cathedral IS the turn-counter, in case you wondered) made Richard Borg laugh so hard that he nearly fell out of the chair, when he watched our game. And it was a hearty laugh if there ever was one!
But seriously - if you like involved but not too heavy games with lots of beautiful bits and pieces  you should clearly consider purchasing this wonderful game. It was one of the very rare cases that a German company produced game was actually completely sold out at Essen, even though it was available in great numbers originally.
Very recommended!

SOLD IT!
then REBOUGHT IT!

Good Worker placement game. Loved the master builder in a bag turn order system (refreshingly different). Felt a bit odd using my workers as "money" (place X workers to buy resources with X for a cost vs. assign 1 worker to get 1 action). Understand why the wooden blocks could be seen as a waste of upping the game cost, but I sort of enjoyed playing with them so I guess I liked having them. Found the rules for replacing start craftsmen fiddly (would rather reduce the number you can have to 4 and have the need to keep spending action to replace them the punishment rather then the listed negative effects... similar to replacing a power plant in power grid "there is no penalty, just the fact that you used money to replace one")

Recently played with only 2 people and found the experience to be a little flat with only minor player interaction, so best with more players.

This would be very good game if some things could be changed to lessen the randomness. 
Random events would be taken away or they would be set visible, 3-5 incoming events at a time.

Drawing the master builders from the bag really wastes the game if it's played with more than 2 players (well, it can be dull with 2 players too). Some kind of bidding could be better system there (maybe income should be doubled to have enough money for that). 
I'll be back here someday when I've had a chance to try how it works.

Still not bad as I paid only 8 euros about the game and it was new (that was a campaign of some dishwashing stuff producer company so I got some chemicals too with my game). =P

Nice game.  It's one of those where you are presented 8-10 choices but may only choose 3 and all 10 are fairly well balanced.  You always feel like if you just had 2 more choices, THEN you'd be set.  This is one of the marks of a good game in my book.

Comparisons to Caylus seem apt in that you are jockeying for positions in the game in order to acquire resources that are converted into points/cash, however, the game feels less calculating & lighter due to the randomness of the worker placement draw bag process.

A worker placement game that seemingly does nothing really well, but (and much more importantly) does nothing poorly. What I mean by that is that its got strategy, but a little short of what Caylus has. It has randomization and optimization, but short of what Agricola or Le Harve has. It also has some more tactical scenarios (drawing of master builders), but it's definitely not a totally tactical game. What you have left is a well rounded worker placement game with no real flaws, but no gimmicks to make it stand out either. This is the first game that was off my radar I've played in a while that I think I could play 10+ times. Good game.

Initial impression is that this is better than Caylus. It's more streamlined and has better pacing. Not surprising given how clunky Caylus is. It's more random though, and this randomness has the potential to serious skew some games. But if you're willing to accept the arbitrary metagaming of the provost mechanism in Caylus, I don't see how the randomness in DSDE can be worse. Overall, not a top-notch Eurogame but acceptable.

Excelente juego que además tiene un tablero completísimo. Se trata de ir construyendo la Catedral entre todos los jugadores, pero no es un juego cooperativo. Tendrás que obtener recursos e invertirlos bien para conseguir los mejores artesanos y asi ir obteniendo puntos de victoria. La dinámica de juego es bastante original, tiene parte de estrategia pero el azar tiene su pequeña porción; aunque tener suficiente dinero te permitirá mover antes que los demás.
Para ganar: conserva los recursos los primeros turnos, si andas pelado de pasta acumula recursos y pÃ¡sate una vez por el mercado, intenta conseguir "metal" que es el recurso más valioso.

Based on Ken Follett's book "The Pillars Of The Earth".  Looks like a decent family game, spoken of as Caylus lite, and the optimizing of resources also reminds me of San Juan.  Less control with four players, but I was fairly impressed with my first two plays (3 and 4 player).  Beautiful components too.  Possible downsides: - too much analysis paralysis for two players? - too random for four players?  logistic game too similar to games we already have like San Juan and St Petersburg? 

Alternatives: [gameid=27364] - Card game version of Caylus, lighter and quicker, 2-4 players, although probably best with 3 or 4.  Basically a game of logistics and resource management.  Quite impressed after the first play (2-player), although it is a real economic euro game and it's not worth having too many in that category.  Not as pretty as Pillars of the Earth however.
[gameid=34635] - Equally beautiful (perhaps better) components, and similar mechanics and concepts, and slightly lighter.
Agricola is also similar in some ways, and perhaps is the best game to get of this sort.

Solid effort, with a fair number of tough choices.  This game is undermined by an excess of luck -- the Event Card and tax die rolls are sources, although both have ways to avoid.  The biggest issue is the Master Builder draw.  This makes it extremely difficult to put together a coherent plan, and turns this from a true strategic 'gamers game', which it appears at first glance, into a lighter family game -- albeit an upper tier family game.

I had some fun sessions of PotE on BSW, but I wouldn't want to play on table relative to the other worker placement options available. On BSW, though, it's one of the better options. 

This is an interesting attempt to merge Caylus and Power Grid, or so it seems. I liked the Power Grid-ish worker cards, but the game is ultimately undone by its randomness and constrained play. Rather than players thwarting each other with thinky, tempo-stealing moves, this design prefers to have the game do it. With so many options out there for worker placement, you can find a tighter design than this one.

Received this from my secret santa in 2008.  Gare thinks the board is too busy and prefers our other WP games and so we don't tend to play with the 2 of us, but I've had success playing with both lighter and heavier gamers.

Good game, I like the luck component of the master builders. We'll see if it keeps being entertaining after more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game.  The gameflow is elegant and with a limit of three masterbuilders, the choices are difficult.  There is a big element of luck introduced with the drawing of the master builder pieces and with the order in which the crafter and event cards come out.  This can seriously mess with one's strategy, so one of the things that makes this game shine for me is the need to maintain flexibility. The master builder issue is mitigated somewhat with the placement rules in the expansion, which is now how we always play. 

Things do get pretty tight with four players, and sometimes the choices are not good with this number, a problem which is addressed with the expansion.

In sum, Pillars of the Earth is a great worker placement game that continues to grow on me, but it seems that everyone  else has moved on from this.

What I really love about this game (except for fabulous artwork) is that the cards get more and more valuable. All players are really tight until the very end. Then, all of a sudden, you have a such a great boost in points where finally some players get paid off for all the right choices they have made during the game.

I was joint 2nd in my first game by one point. It's good but it didn't catch me or inspire me. It seemed like the same old same old, collect some resource, convert into VPs in different ways, a bit of randomness in Events and a draw bag, a bit of turn order. Heyho, nothing new here. But for all that, it's a good game, a good introduction to heavier games for many people, a lush product, nice bits (over-illustrated though). I'm not saying don't play this or don't buy it. It just didn't excite me.

RATING: 7.5
Provides an engrossing experience.  This is a high-quality game with a smooth design, feels rich in theme, and is probably Mayfair's best production.  The intricate graphics on the board along with the wooden Cathedral "turn marker" all add to the experience.

Another "worker placement" game.  It's not as smart as Caylus, but I prefer the shorter playing time.  Pillars also doesn't feel as "dry" and the splash of luck adds some excitement.  For the most part, the luck doesn't feel too overpowering (perhaps except the master builder draw in rounds 4 & 5).  Pillars is a good game that's fun to play and offers plenty of agonizing decisions!  Grade: B-

Played 2 times, with 2 and 4 players. And I will never play 2-players again! "2-player spread problem" (eg. El Grande, Elfenland): very little need to directly compete since you don't get in each other's way. I think this game would cook with 4 players, but still not my type. I am not into "incremental" style games. A second playing with 4 players - which I won in the last round - actually lowered my rating of this game. I just find it terribly uninteresting.

Reminds me of Stone Age but with a different player order & purchase mechanic I do enjoy.  Building of the church in the middle of the game board is unnecessay even though it is the theme of the game.  Gorgeous board, quality game.

More game, less exercise than Caylus, which is the obvious comparison for PotE.  I really enjoy games that after the rules are explained, you only need one turn to understand the sequence of events.  My next games will obviously be better informed as knowing which cards to wait for and how much to spend on them is important.  I like this game.  Read the book!

This is a typical euro, with resource management, victory point conversion and a bit of luck thrown in for good measure. A couple of things seem wrong though. For one, I think there are too many different resources (good cubes, money, meeples, victory points) and some of them are almost equivalent (money vs meeple). Also, the action selection phase, with its randomness, can throw the game one way or the other during the last turns. Finally, the game just doesn't feel original. Developement is better here than in Leonardo da Vinci, but I'm not convinced it makes for a better game.

Csodaszép, és egyedi működésű, talán munkáslehelyezősnek nevezhető játék. Kicsit van egy három zöldet két sárgát váltok 10 pontra érzés, de még pont elviselhető mértékben. A legtöbb mechanika nem forradalmian új, de pont annyi csavar van benne, ami izgalmassá teszi a játékot. Azért talán a zsákból húzás randomsága egy kicsit nincs teljesen szinkronban a játék nehézségével, komolyságával. Akik ezt meg tudják tanulni, azoknak ez a random már zavaró lehet.

Pillars is a worker placement game that I'd place somewhere between Caylus and Stone Age in terms of both game weight and luck factor. Originally, I was a bit concerned about long-term value, especially due to the fact that there was a fixed set of artisans that would be used in each and every game so that while you could not be sure exactly when (or rather where) they appear it was certain they would do so eventually. Luckily, the expansions available seem to deal with this and I no longer expect this to be a problem.

The random turn order adds a lot of luck to the game, possibly a bit too much for its own good, but that, too, has been addressed in the expansion.

Update: As expected, replayability without the expansion is an issue. I'll always try to add the expansion; not necessarily the new board but the additional cards for certain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
PRO - Game board is beautiful.  Game play is fun.  I like a dash of luck in most games, so the random pulling of the builders is okay by me.  

CON - Game needs more craftsmen, but I might be able to resolve that with the expansion.

Beautiful game.  Only played it with two players so far and really plays pretty friendly.  I can see the actions would get a lot tighter with even one more player.  The random master builder draw introduces some interesting chaos into the game and that will have a larger impact in a game with more players, which is different than most other worker placement games I've seen.

I have played quite a bit of this game online on BSW.  The more I play it, the more frustrated I am with the fact that there are better cards/spaces than others and if you don't get the draws for the master builders, you will no doubt lose.  I like how the economy increases in point production as the game goes on.  The game is definitely very attractive and the theme is actually pretty well integrated with the mechanics.  Not really all that excited to play this one anymore.

PotE is a very mechanically sound worker placement / resource management game that feels a little straightforward considering the impressive worker games that have come out in the past number of years, but this one was one of the earliest examples. It is a very fluid game to play and features some great artwork by Michael Menzel.  For fans of WP games, this is a staple.  I love the diminishing costs for placing workers and the blind draw.  As WP games go, PotE still offers something that the others don't.

If this was the first worker placement game I had ever played I would have been really impressed. Since this is my favorite type of game and I've played a lot of them there's nothing really new for me here. Still it's mechanically solid, has a nice board and good components. Feels like a missed opportunity that the cool cathedral component is not integrated into the game and is only used to indicate which round you're in.

A very solid worker placement game.  The presentation is gorgeous.  The decisions are all tense, as every element to the game feels dire, and Pillars' play is easy to learn, but challenging enough, to make this a strong mid weight game. My opinion has only ever increased with each play.  Not the game Agricola is, but offers enough flavor and unique twists on the genre that it doesn't feel it will become neglected.

  *-update-* The 5-6 player expansion is a must-have and can greatly enhance (and balance) the standard 4 player game.

I want to like this game for it's beautiful artwork and varied strategy, but then the bag draws can completely destroy your planning, in some cases leaving you no viable alternative.  I think this is better with fewer players as you can recover better from bad draws, and have far more alternatives to work with when the board is uncrowded.  Might upgrade if I ever play it again with just 3, as it's probably a better game.  Have only played with 4 or more, once with the expansion.

Accurately referred to as "Caylus light," Pillars of the Earth is a beautifully-rendered game about building a cathedral. I prefer this to Caylus because the theme is more prescient and the components are more elaborate. The cards are a little flimsy but the art is beautiful.

Excelente juego de colocación de trabajadores que aprovecha bien el trasfondo de la famosa novela como excusa para desarrollar las reglas. Sirve como juego introductorio pero también para jugones experimentados. A destacar que, a diferencia de otros eurogames, no es fácil prever quién será el ganador cuando se llega al último turno.

An attractive game and interesting mechanics.  So far played exclusively on BSW, which has a very nice interface for the game.Lowering my rating after mutliple plays.  I'm not really sure why, but I've just gotten tired of this game.  Somehow it is just not all that engaging.  An OK game, but not a favorite.

After 21 plays on BSW I think I've reached my limit with this one.

I've tried this with two players, and it seems that there were some places I never needed to place a master builder. I assume that this one's sweet spot is three or four players, but even with two, it's a great lighter euro. One I recommend to anyone looking for a medium weight gateway game.

Less brain-draining than Caylus, but still very strategic with just the right amount of luck. Despite the theme (another church/castle/city being built in the renainssance...has this theme been killed? Yet??), it's a really fun game, which looks really nice, with very high production.

Great worker placement game with beautiful mechanics. Instead of turn order advantage there is a nice mechanism - pulling workers from bag with cost track balanced with cost for placing worker (first pulled costs more, second less etc.). Works well and beautiful. The game allows strategic decisions while not some random events forgotten. Together it results in nice light worker placement game, slightly better than Stone Age, which has is strategically much more straightforward.

I enjoyed my first play of The Pillars of the Earth, although I doubt it could withstand heavy play.  As others have mentioned, it's a lot like a much lighter, much more random Caylus or Leonardo da Vinci.  Pillars may actually be the best of the three, but . . . well, let's just say there are better games to reference than Caylus or Leonardo da Vinci.

[Update] I've played twice now.  The second game was a little less fun than the first, and I expect the pattern to continue if I play again, which is unlikely.  Leonardo da Vinci, though it's nothing special, is proving to have more replay value for me than Pillars of the Earth.

Can see why it's compared to Caylus. Lots of options to explore. Some 'luck' involved, but I don't mind that factor in a game.

Plays pretty well even with 2 players (can finish in 45 minutes), but we prefer 4 if at all possible. We usually play with 3 because that's all that's available. I almost always finish 2nd. But that seems to be changing. I won plays 51-53!

I like this game a bunch... even better with the expansion, but I like some of the other worker placement games in my collection a little bit better.  I might try this as a "next step up" with friends who have played some gateway games already.  Also one of the only games in my collection that can play 6 (with the expansion).  The base game does seem a little bit repetitive/scripted after a while-- the expansion fixes that.

I guess I'm the odd one out on this one. With three players there is little conflict for placement and the conversion of workers to resources to points is just so direct that it holds little interest. With four players the order of placment can really mess with you, swamping what few decisions you had in a three player game by forcing many of those choices. Lots of better games out there.

What a wonderfully produced game, with stunning art and great components. The game is good too, but with some plays I have found that there is less strategy in this game than many other worker placement games. What you do is mainly to get a good round and in some ways set up for the next round. On the other hand it has a more economic feel to it, which I like.

I liked my play of Pillars of the Earth, but I didn't find anything special about the game. It has some interesting mechanics, but after a round or two I found myself simply doing the same thing over and over. There's just not enough variety of things to do for me. If I want to play an entry level worker placement game, I will just stick to Stone Age. I wonder if the expansion(s) would take this from OK/good to great?

RATING: 6.7
On first sight there are a lot of options but during the game it offers only few tactical decisions which seem to be compulsions of optimization.
 
Considering also the static course of the game, this is too few to make Pillars an outstandig game.
Furthermore I am concerned about two things: the scoring mechanism and significant luck influence (draw out of the bag).
The scoring mechanism because you will get in the last round nearly a thrid of VPs as you did in the 5 rounds before (balance issue). The last round is so important that you must be first player to be sure to get what you need. The luck of the draw (out of the bag) may destroy the advantages of your strategy so that all players end with only few VPs difference.
[i]It is too complex for a familiy game but has to much luck factor for strategic purists.[/i] So neither target group is satisfied throughout. However I still like the theme and atmosphere during the game but honestly I don't feel like building a Cathedral. The game doesn't live up its awards.

Played 10+ times. I think this was the 2nd ever "worker placment" game I experienced, the first being Caylus which it feels similar to. There is nothing wrong with that. Both are great games. I would say that this game is the more refined of the two though there are not the multiple paths to victory that Caylus has so games will start to feel samey with nothing new to discover in the game play. April 07 

*UPDATE* The expansion makes the game feel better balanced and lifts it over some of the other worker placment games I have now rated. I still don't think it is as good as Caylus because it lacks whole game strategic choices but to indicate its improvement with the expansion I'll give it an additional half mark. Sept 08

*UPDATE* I have just recorded my tenth play. With the expansion I rate it a 9. May 11

I really liked it and found it 'fun' to a certain extent.

After only one play, I found this isn't my favorite worker placement game.  Still, I'd play it again, and the production value is high with pretty board art.  Seemed to not always be interesting choices based on how your workers come out of the draw bag.  If given a choice, I'd probably pull out Stone Age before this.

RATING: 10
Beautiful game. And if you read the book the game play enhances what you already know from the story. Makes you feel like you're actually there and are battling the evil and trying to do good while going against others who want to do the same thing. 

This game has elements of daily life, how you'd live it, how you'd manage it, but it's not as gruesome like Agricola. PotE just mixes everything well making the gaming very enjoyable. 

One of my favorites. And yes, you should read the book.

One of the most prominent worker placement games, but firmly rooted in the efficiency-engine style of converting resources into victory points.

Építészek „háborúja”
Kevés olyan játékkal találkozhat az ember, amelynek tervezésekor egy kiadott könyvet vettek alapul. Itt Ken Follett híres monumentális regénye, a Katedrális szolgáltatja az alapot, amely kis hazánkban is népszerűségnek örvend, sőt már sorozat is készült belőle, ha valakit elrettent a majd 1000 oldal elolvasása.
A regény szereplői, eseményei ebben a társasban visszaköszönnek ránk, így a mű olvasója könnyebben bele tudja élni magát a szerepébe. Maga a játéktábla is a legszebbek egyike, így nem csoda, hogy játék közben elkalandozhat a figyelmünk egy-egy részlet megtekintése közben.
A játékban a katedrális megépítését követjük végig (fix 6 fordulón keresztül), amelynek során munkásaink és mestereink segítségével építőanyagot, pénzt és győzelmi pontot gyűjtünk, privilégiumokat, támogatást szerzünk. Ezek közül a játék végén a győzelmi pontok mennyisége alapján kerül ki a győztes, de ahogy ez lenni szokott, a meglévő lehetőségeink legjobb kombinálása kell az elsőbbséghez.
Minden fordulóban 3 fázis játszunk végig. Az elsőben lehetőségünk van munkásainkkal építőanyagot megszerezni vagy a pénzünkből egyre jobb mestereket alkalmazni, akik a megszerzett építőanyagot győzelmi pontokká „alakítják” át. A játékosok egymás után következnek és ameddig van munkásuk választhatnak a kihelyezett kártyák közül.
Majd következik a legizgalmasabb rész, az építészeink táblára történő lehelyezése. A kezdőjátékos egy vászonzsákból sorban húzogatja ki a játékosok bábúit, majd azt az egyre kisebb költségű helyekre teszi le. Ha fizetsz a kis pénzecskédből, hamarabb cselekedhetsz, mint a többiek, de fogy a pénzed. Ha később következel, azt olcsóbban megúszod, de mi marad már neked? A táblán 14 helyszínből 9 helyszín egyikére (valamelyik helyszínen akár több lehetséges hely van, hogy több játékos is használja azt) teheted le az építészedet, amely helyszíneken jó és jobb dolgok történnek veled.
A harmadik fázisban pedig a lerakott munkások és építészek bábúit vesszük vissza és hajtjuk végre a helyszínek akcióit (játékos befolyásoló események kivédése, győzelmi pontok megszerzése, mesteremberek megszerzése, adómentesség, kezdőjátékos szerepének átvétele, piacolás az építőanyagokkal és így tovább…).
Minden forduló 3. fázisának 13. helyszínén, a Katedrálisban történik meg az eddig elvégzett, kitaktikázott munka gyümölcsének leszüretelése és a meglévő mestereid segítségével a győzelmi pontok bezsákolása. Általánosságban elmondható, hogy az építőanyagok közül az olcsóbbakból kevesebb pontod lesz, a drágábbakból több, viszont az olcsóbbakból többet tudsz egy fordulódban felhasználni, míg a drágábbakból kevesebbet.
A játékosok feladata jó építésvezetőként megtalálni az egyensúlyt a pénz-építőanyag-mesterek között.
Sajnos 2 főnél mindenképpen háziszabályok alkalmazása ajánlott, mert egyszerűen nincs versenyhelyzet, a játékélmény ezáltal kisebb is lesz. Egyes helyszínek is erősebbnek tűnnek a többinél, valamint eddig a kő és a kőfaragó mester kombója is elég erősnek mutatkozott.
Összességében egy szép, tematikus, bestseller regényre épülő játékot ismertem meg, amely a fenti hiányosságok ellenére is jó szórakozás.

After 6 games with 2 players, i like very much but would like to point several things to improve:

-There are too few cards (specially artisan ones) and also the last round the "advantage" cards are always the same. Too easy to memorize and this goes against replayability.

-With standard rules we never had the need to place our master builders at the market (so now every round we dray 5 instead of 7 resource cards)

-Also, we almost never placed the builder on the "Next Initial Player", as with two players one rarely feels the need.

Overall, a funny game, even for 2 players.

Based on one play. It was okay. Not necessarily going to write home about it, but prefered it to World Without End. Played only with two people so maybe that's why it seemed more fun.

Liked it somewhat more after the second play. This one with the expansion tho.

This is, indeed, exceptionally similar to Caylus, but I much prefer this game--faster, less downtime, more to do, and feels more "open" despite it having fewer paths to victory. Then again, I'm not a huge Caylus fan to begin with. That said, the competition amongst worker-placement games is now extremely fierce, and I'm not sure Pillars can stand on its own anymore.

The first worker-placement part (going for ressources) is extremely boring and not really good and the second part (putting pieces onto the board) is also extremely boring.

I don´t know, this game has just nothing to offer. You just put a few workers here and there and nothing happens. Also, all you actually do, is upgrading your cards, so there isn´t much variation at all. This isn´t intense or strategical at any time, just plain boring.

Whats better than a multi-phase game where you get to build a cathedral at the end of the round? I enjoyed how each phase was so drastically different, making the game feel like so many games all in one.

I must admit this was a really fun game with the four players.  We didn't know who was going to win or what strategies might come out of this.  WE had a grand time while it also has that appeal that you are "Building" something, and that one is literally doing that is even more appealing.

Un jeu grosso modo de cubes (placement de travailleurs) qui laisse place à une grande part de hasard parfois déconcertant avec la pige initiale des pions dans le sac de tissus. C'est facile de se confondre avec le nombre de cubes requis pour accomplir un objectif. C'est assez long et peu interractif. C'est un Euro qui ne se distingue pas vraiment des autres du genre: on ramasse des cartes qui nous donne des cubes en plaçant des ouvriers et ensuite on remet les cubes à la banque en réalisant des cartes d'objectifs qui vont nous amener à faire des points de victoire. Le thème n'est pas tellement accrocheur non plus. Le jeu est par ailleurs quand même assez esthétique. Ce n'est pas un jeu que j'achèterais. C'est le genre de jeux qu'on peut se lasser rapidement étant donné son absence de thème original fort.

Most of my friends don't like this one, because you can play well and target a specific turn to get some specific worker, only to be slapped on your cheek by the ominous black bag of doom. I never felt that to be a problem, but had to sell the game because I couldn't get it to the table enough... Good game, don't believe the bad press until you've at least tried it. Much better than Stone Age, for example.

I really like the board graphics.  I liked the big church pieces as a time mechanism, any game bits that big are cool.  The theme was mostly absent.  We are each builders, working on a cathedral and getting VPs?  You have contractor dudes helping you (represented on cards) they give you the "exchange rate" of resource cubes to money or veeps.  You use money to hire new contractor dudes and you have some workers you use to mine/farm/lumberjack you resource cubes.  There are also master builders which take special actions every turn.  Not a bad basic idea, and a popular one in the world of euros.

The problem is that it boils down to yet another worker placement game where very few of your options are interesting and each turn you look around, place your guy in the least ass spot available, and go merrily on your way...  None of the decisions seem particularly tense or interesting, but occasionally a tough decision will be produced.  Did AOE:III spoil me such that few other worker placement games will satisfy?  

Also, How many times are we going to see the put in resource cubes, use your upgradeable building/worker/merchant etc. to produce vps game design?  I cannot see how this particular game would really have any kind of replayability, although it does belong in the "once every three months" euro collection model.  Most (all?) of the interaction is just who is going to get in line first for the shitty option they dislike the least.  Not my type of game at all...

RATING: 8
This game is very, very good. It has just the right amount of randomness for my taste. You can play it thinking very deeply and still turns don't take very long. Probably the most beautiful board on any game ever. This game could become a 10, but I need to play it a few more times to be sure. Right now, I have a single strategy that I have been playing with great sucess. I want someone to force me to adapt and show me all the multiple paths to victory. When I see that, well.... wow. I'm very worried about the overpoweredness of the woodworker who converts to gold. 
UPDATE: Dropped to an 8.That woodworker problem just won't go away. 
UPDATE: Expansion fixes some of the problems here to a degree. Need to play a bit more though.

RATING: 6.5
Kind of like Caylus, but missing the very nice "player order isn't random except for the first turn" feature of Caylus.  Nice that everybody has the same number of Master Builders (workers), but the order each turn is a totally random grab bag (literally).

Six turns is exactly the right number for this game -- you can see where the game is going and make plans, but it doesn't take too long to finish.  Unlike Caylus (which has no randomness), analysis paralysis is minimized somewhat because of the random event cards, privilege cards, and craftsman cards coming out.  (Well, in the base game, all the craftsmen come out every turn, but some get taken as an action and some have to be paid for with gold, which randomizes things a lot.)
 
My first game was 2-player, which is good, but quite different -- not nearly as much conflict for actions.  I actually like 2-player, because you can be more strategic, and not have to hedge too much against the possibility that all the good actions might be taken by the time your next Master Builder gets drawn.

I also played 4- and 5-player (with the expansion) -- very crowded, and hard to score consistently.  But it's remarkable how people tend to specialize in their own path to points, which allows you to avoid other people's paths.

Overall, a fun game so far, and I wouldn't mind playing it every once in a while.

I had a miserable time playing this game. It was boring, dry, and I had no feeling of competition or engagement with others, no connection to anything resembling  "play". There were zero stakes in the game for me. 

It is possible that this is because I didn't get enough of a rulesplanation before launching. I'll probably try the game again if the opportunity arises, and I'll be sure to change this rating if my first impression was wrong.

RATING: 9
 Pillars is nice to see, and even though the construction is a pretext (just like in Caylus), it feels a little less abstract (thanks to the literary reference and the beautiful board); what makes this a keeper is that it is way more easy to teach than Caylus: I played with my 10 years daughter with no problem, and she liked it. 
Note that the only commonality with Caylus is the worker placement mechanism, and it's implemented differently.
Not only the game is simple to play but the rules are written so that you can start playing without reading them completely.
The game becomes deeper as you are more acknowledged with the cards; then you can really establish strategies.  As these crafter cards are not that numerous, it is useful to show them when explaining the rules, showing for instance what can be done with gold and how to make many points at the end of the game; other wise, new players will be crushed and disgruntled with the game.

Oy. I don't want to be too harsh on this one since I had a rough learning game. But it struck me as a pretty standard worker placement game with not much to recommend it and a lot of downtime to hinder the experience. I should give it another chance but... I don't really want to.

Glad I eventually tried this a second time. It moved much more quickly and smoothly. I'll never be a fan of worker placement games, but this might be the best one I've played. It obviously has a lot of depth and seems well balanced, without being unnecessarily complicated. Decent.

Easy to grasp, multiple choices to agonize over.  I would prefer a different mix of craftsmen, not in a fixed order as they come out each turn, as with the priveleges and events; so that you don't know which will appear in a given game.  And who doesn't love a random draw?  'Me', for one.  Yet even with a broken mechanism I'd rather play it than say Leonardo daVinci which has a better mechanism.

I haven't played this game in quite a while, and don't often feel compelled to play it.  Thus, it is no longer worthy of a 10 among my others.  I think the dry theme makes it tough to play too often.  I'd like to play it more and feel like I at least got my moneys-worth out of it.  After further game playing and retroactive analysis, it just doesn't belong among my 10s.

More challenging than Stone Age and in my opinion a little bit better. There's more strategy and I really like the theme on this. I know some say that it doesn't feel like you are building the cathedral, but I beg to differ. I think the theme and mechanics are really well put together. And the mini cathedral you build after each round doesn't feel just glorified roundmarker to me, but adds to the theme. And you are not just getting some artifial VPs either. The VPs represent your effort towards building the cathedral and makes perfect sense. I like this game.

I thought this was an excellet adaptation from the book.  I wasn't a huge fan of the gameplay though, but since I loved the book, I'm willing to give it a few more shots.  I felt it was a bit too much determined by turn order.  Never going first/second made it very difficult to get new craftsmen, thus making it hard to get any victory points.  Getting the "start player" space is determined by luck of the draw, and so with only 6 possible rounds, one may never get any new craftsmen.

Rating upgraded 2010 - playing it more allowed me to develop a better strategy - especially knowing the upcoming craftsmen.  This is good for longtime players, but really puts new players at a significant disadvantage.

Traded it for [thing=123260][/thing] at a local math trade and after reading through the rules and doing a play test, I'm fairly pumped to play it with another person!

[b]Update:[/b] Although I screwed up the points tracking and we were tired, it's as fun as I was expecting after playing the test game. Every turn is agonizing because there is so much you want to do but the things and you are so sure that you got short-changed in a turn because you forget that your opponent has the same agonizing type of choices to make and they feel the same way. Good stuff!

Well put together Euro. But it seemed sometimes the cards/rolls you could grab were quite different in quality. If they (card placements etc.) fall nicely for you when you are going first you can get nice freebies. Or not. Or be left with the dregs. Such luck lightens the game and is probably seen as a weakness. But it also helps to speed the game - removing some of the analysis paralysis you get with more luckless brainburners like Caylus or Power Grid.

An instant favorite of mine.  I love the choices and varying strategies this game offers.  The blind draw for the master builders is fun and the game has a nice pace to it.  I wish the cathedral was more than just a round counter, but it is very cool anyway.  It would be neat to paint it up with gargoyles, rosetta windows, etc.  Overall a fun, light strategy game.  Not quite a gateway game but a great second step.  This one will be coming out a lot!

Wow. Great game. I have seen people call this the lite Caylus or something to that effect. Not sure I agree with that since I don't find Caylus all that difficult (at least after a couple of games). While they share similarities though, they are totally different. Plus this one can be played in a lot less time. I would also make it known, that although there isn't a lot of direct player interaction, you can prevent your opponents from doing a lot of things depending on what cards you pick and where you play your builders. I would put the interaction along the lines of St. Petersburg, though more screwage factor is in this one.Very high replayability on this one, too. I highly recommend this one. Try it out on BSW if you can. And if you do, search BGG under this game for the english file for the game. Works awesome, and is so much easier to understand what is going on.

An interesting Caylus variant, with just one criticism: the craftsmen are all VERY similar with upgrades simply providing a more efficient conversion of cubes to VPs.

[b]A BEAUTIFUL BOARD, BEAUTIFUL BITS, BEAUTIFUL CARDS, BEAUTIFUL STORY. THIS GAME SO FAR IS EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITES, AND IT ALL GOT BETTER [I]AFTER[/I] I READ THE BOOK AND WATCHED THE MINISERIES. A MUST-HAVE FOR EVERY BOARD GAMER[/b]

The first time I played this game, I hated it, I didn’t understand what was happening and the whole worker placement idea of it made my head hurt. Too many decisions, too many layers of depth, all of them so foreign and strange to me, left me unfulfilled. I never wanted to play it again.

After realizing the game was based on a book that had received so great reviews and criticism, I look a bit into it, and finally read it. The story was amazingly elegant, the characters were complex enough to empathize with them and their backgrounds and the whole idea behind it all, the construction of the Kingsbridge cathedral, was to say the least epic. Building things that stand the test of time is a topic that has always interested me, and after reading the book, I started learning more about cathedrals and medieval buildings. I am not very religious, but cathedrals do have a certain air of sanctity and accomplishment. I had to try it out myself, if only through the minor experience of playing a master builder in the board game I had once hated.

The circle was complete. The co-op aspect of the game and between the players, all acting like master builders in the construction of a model cathedral (Good idea to have the pieces of a small wooden building to place on the board game after each round) is astonishing and it makes the players feel like they are working together in a humbling project and in a vital part of History. But in spite of that, the race for the best resources, the best artisans and the best places in the king’s court is what the game is all about.

Each player starts humbly in the same place, with the same possibilities, although with a minor difference in money, which is sometimes very important, but sometimes it means so very little, so thinking that money will win the game is not a certainty, but an ignorant man’s (Or woman) wishful thinking. After getting their hands on the best resource extracting sites, and hiring a few new artisans, the players will have a vast number of advantages from where to choose to place their pawns, each with a particular advantage that only that player will have, until better choices appear and the player decides he must change his outlook on his building project. Selling and buying at the supermarket, recruiting the help of the characters from the book or racing to be the first to get the precious metal cubes are only a few of these choices.

The game features also one of the best artwork and designs ever created, in my honest opinion. Michael Menzel did an amazing job with the board game illustration and the card drawings. Certainly, the game is worth buying for the art alone.

Easily, The Pillars of the Earth is one of my Top 5 games of all time.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Themed: The round and turn system is common to many games, but the depth of precision within this game makes it difficult to separate certain stages of the round and turn from the theme of it. Maybe a game about pure administration could do well with almost every element within the game, but the ambient of the game is very well served from it’s theme, and viceversa. Also, the whole building of a medieval cathedral thing is way to strong to simply say this is an abstract game with a certain theme thrown in. The game was created through the implementation and constant presence of the theme, or so it looks to me. Theme... theme.
 
Simple [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Complex: A good game to me is one that’s easy to learn and hard to master. The endless menu of options and the limited amount of decision to be taken makes this game amazingly deep and intricate and a bad decision could echo through the rest of the game, so players are required to approach each decision with ease and calm, and every investment must be done hoping it will bring about fortune in the future. Playing while focused on one thing will certainly not win the game.

Strategic [b]__ [COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Tactical: Players might think that the amount of decisions means tactical decisions will win this game. They wouldn’t be wrong, but strategies may pay off if they’re well executed and the events of the game and the decisions of other don’t affect them too much. Changing the strategy in the middle of the game may be a risky move, but experimentation could serve best the goals of the players. 
 
Luck [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Skill: Luck plays a very small part in this game, because there’s always one way or the other, sooner or later, to change fate or to avoid certain random dangers, like losing workers, money, resources or time. Waiting for the right moment (If possible) is a sound idea. 

Fiddly [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Elegant: The game is not perfect. A lot of questions will arise while playing the game, but they won’t be too big to bring the game to a halt. The most common questions and doubts about the game can also be solved with logic and some application of the same principles the game is based on, but playing with newbies with the rule book close at hand is always a good idea..
 
Indirect interaction [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Direct interaction: Players may decide to use certain pawns to block other players, but a quiet and nice game can be reached too, with the occasional misstep here and block there. As the number of players increase, so will the need to be a little bit more ruthless will appear. 

Cutthroat [b]_____[COLOR=#FF0000][6][/COLOR]____[/b] Friendly: Like I said before, plying to win does not mean playing to destroy the competition. Sometimes, playing for the fun of it and not minding what the other players do could very well be the best decision, and with a good group of friends, this game can be a true delight, almost completely free of feuds and races between master builders..

Heavy use of language [b]_____[COLOR=#FF0000][6][/COLOR]____[/b] No language needed: The very few cards that use text are easy to understand and apply, sometimes there will be doubts about how certain term works or what a precise word means within the context of the game, but usually, those doubts are not really that difficult to solve. The game in that sense uses a lot of language, but certain terms are easy to understand.

[b][i]III. Number of players recommended[/i][/b]: 4.

Much lighter than Caylus, with kind of a St. Pete-like investment mechanism. Yes, it is a game about converting cubes into victory points.  But I [i]like[/i] converting cubes into victory points. Still, random player order in a worker placement game is probably a bad idea, and it feels a little too abstracted. I guess I'd say it feels a little half-assed and needs another twist or a theme or something. (4 plays)

First played January 20th, 2010. Taught in 15 minutes, played in 1.5 hours with 3 players. This has good strategy and luck balance. The game last 6 rounds. The initial start player (random) is given 20gold and each following player is given 1 more gold. Each player is given 2 VPs, 3 master builders, 3 initial craftsmen (cards), and 8 workers (one is larger and counts as 5). The board is set with resources wood (forest), stone (quarry), sand (beach), metal (king court), extra workers (castle), 12 (4 of each: wood, stone, sand goods; trading post), event card, 2 privledge cards, and 2 crasftmen cards.  An additional 2 craftsmen cards along with 6 goods cards are placed for players to begin bidding workers for starting with the start player. The player pays $(for crastmen upgrades; limit 5 total including starting 3) or workers for goods. Players may also choose to place workers in the town to get $1 each worker. Next the start player pulls a materbuilder from a bag and places it on a cost wheel (starts at $7). The start player may also once per round re-draw one pawn at any time. Players may choose to place their pawn in the castle(2 workers for next round), trade goods(buy), ignore event, upgrade crastmen, be start player next turn(if not chosen order remains the same), take a privlege card(extra good, etc), 1-2 VPs, go to king's court(first there gets a metal, all are exempt from tax), or pass. The cost goes down one for each sucessive pawn drawn until zero is reached. All pawns after and previously passed pawns placement cost is $0, in order origianlly draw. The event card is revealed(lose goods, master builder, or other hardship). Next players use their craftsmen to turn goods into $ or VPs. Board cards are replenished and the next round begins.

Pillars of the Earth is an awesome middle/light weight worker placement game with terrific production value and excellent mechanics. The flow of the game works great--the down time between turns in Pillars of the Earth is pleasantly small; players are constantly engaged in the game. The cards that allow rules to be broken are very interesting. Players are continually making interesting choices. I only have one play logged, but I imagine I wouldn't want to play repeatedly for an extended time-- a terrific game to add to regular rotation and a game I would want to keep in my collection for a long time. 

Probably the most outstanding thing about Pillars of the Earth, besides the super cool production value, is the mechanic where players take turns placing master builders on the board to draft actions. Each player has three master builders(action pawns), and everyone's master builders are randomly drawn from a bag one at a time by the start player. The first master builder drawn must choose between paying 7 money to draft an action or pass. Then the next drawn must choose between paying 6 money and pass. This continues until all the MBs are drawn(actions become free after seven are drawn) when the bag has emptied, any passed MBs, then get to choose actions for free in the sequence they passed. That mechanic is awesome. The decisions are very interesting and it makes the game exciting and fun. The start player has the privilege of once a round replacing a drawn MB into the bag, like if he had drawn first and didn't want to pay 7 or if a bunch had been drawn and there is an actin he really wants and he didn't pull his own MB. This action drafting mechanic is excellent and adds a significant fun factor to the game play.

Uh-oh. People liked this game at Essen 06. This means that the perma-negs on bgg will now have to prove how much they DON'T like this game. Expect nothing but cries of "rubbish" "terrible" "awful" and "overhyped".

Especially from people who play the game only once.

Remember, if you needed to get a life before playing a boardgame, you'll still need to get a life afterwards. No board game, no matter how good, will take the miserable, hopeless, bottomless well of daily despair and lousy excuse for a life that the perma-negs of bgg live in, and make it better.

Classic worker placement.  Has some pitfalls to play in that players who specialize in specific resources usually have the edge.  Starting to feel a little old & worn when compared to new wp games (like Village, Euphoria, & Manhattan Project).  Box cover has slight speckling where something dark has spattered onto it in fine droplets (would annoy anyone looking for a pristine box but few other people would notice).

Was blown away the first time I played it (August 2008), now the novelty starts wearing off a bit. Nevertheless it's still a great game, nice mechanisms that you can find in other games as well. 
You can just unfold the board to spend some time admiring the wonderful artwork ;-)
Sometimes it's hard to make a decision as there might be many good options to choose from when you place your master builders.

Pillars of the Earth is a very good game, but a little strange for me for reasons that I can't quite explain. The experience of playing it is very intriguing; the game has a unique character to it. It's much different than most games I own/play. The theme is very different, but surprisingly well represented through the mechanics. I'm not very good at the game, but I still find it entertaining. It's quite beautiful to look at, and one's choices within the game have incredible weight, giving the game a very tense undertone. Did you mess up and not get the most out of your extra worker on the third turn? That's definitely going to come back to haunt you. This lends the game to a little bit of analysis paralysis, but I don't think to a crippling degree. 

It has a sort of timeless quality to it that is hard to define. It doesn't get played much these days, and I'm not sure why.

First game with 4 players. Pillars of the Earth is a well-designed game that works smoothly and has attractive components. However, like many a recent mid-weight Euro game (Notre Dame is a prime culprit), the theme just does not matter. OK, so Pillars is not quite as bad as Notre Dame in this respect but isn't PotE supposed to be based on a novel? If this were the game's only fault then I would still rate it an 8. But the element of chance is also a bit of a turn-off. I have no problem with the random selection of the various cards and the rolling of the die to determine the level of tax. But there is THE BAG!!! Twice I used the start player special ability to put one of my master builders back in the bag and drew...another of my master builders. UPDATE: I have played 3 or 4 times now and I appreciate the game more. The bag can still be annoying, but I'm prepared to accept it.

Lots of good buzz, but eh, I didn't really need to own it.  The turn order mechanism keeps the game from being dry and mechanical, but I still did not find much new under the sun here.  Also, the Cathedral bits themselves are just a cost hike, and play NO ROLE IN THE GAME at all.  So, like other exotica that is slow in coming to the US, I think the buzz has outpaced the play.

Maybe just a bit too much of randomness - especially with greater number of players (who happens to get the best craftsmen has a great advantage).

EDIT: Unfortunately after a few plays it becomes a bit boring and monotonous.  And that's where the expansion comes to the rescue! (see my comment on it).

EDIT 2 (after more plays, incl. expansion): It's good but just misses something... don't know... originality, staying freshness, replayability...  Again, I find this game too monotonous and repetitive.  I'm not hot on playing it in the future although something unexplainable still attracts me to it :-)

Lots has been said already.

From a 'Gamer's' point of view I wasn't expecting too much as enough people had said it was a lighter Caylus style game and that did turn out to be true for the most part. 

Too random, too much luck and too derivative to stand out as anything special. I will probably try to play something else when and if this gets suggested but the game does serve its purpose as a more accessible Caylus type game.

I played 3 times and I don't see how I would like to play it again. I don't see much challenge or important decisions here, you just take whatever your luck let's you take and hope for a good result.

It's too complicated to be a gateway game and too random to be a gamer's game.

Not a big fan after two plays.  While it has some Caylus-like elements of placing workers, I found the random draw of the builder element to add too much chaos.  What's the point in having a game requiring careful resource planning if you have no idea of the turn order?  The only thing going for it is that it's fairly short & quick compared to similar games.  I would almost always prefer to play a different "classic" Euro over this one - Princes, El Grande, etc.

Rating after 2 plays... some things better than Caylus, some things not better (more luck in this one).  What surprised me is how, in a 3 player game, I was able to come from last place to tied for 1st on the last round (and won on the tie breaker by having 1 gold more)! 2nd play was with 4 and agree that it becomes more random so 3 players may be best. May wait for English version (cards have German text on them, though not a big problem in the way they are used).

June 2014 update: played 1st 5 player game (w/expansion set of course)... this game was new and exciting 7 years ago... now so many better worker placement acquire things to turn them into VP's w/out the luck factor.  Reading my older comments above I may be willing to try again with 3 players again to see if that comment about 3 being the best for this game

Die Säulen der Erde is a very nice medium-weight game, not as light as the term 'family game' might imply, but not as deep or convoluted as the heavy-weighter it is most often (rightly) compared to, Caylus. The game feels quite friendly with two players, with not so much in the way of direct competition for scarce resources; with more players, competition becomes much more pronounced. Heartily recommended; at the moment my favorite game from this year's Essen. My only real complaint is that the mechanism for drawing master builders from the bag seems too random, if one is trying to play this as a "real" strategy game.

Certainly a very fine light-medium weight game, fairly accessible and great fun.
The random manner in which master builders are selected for placement can be a problem though. You should be able to work around it, so I consider it a minor glitch.

I have a few problems with this game: 1) If someone else follows you into a strategy, you both are screwed. 2) It's very hard to change strategies. 3) Small apparent differences in values on the cards multiply into large (e.g. 10-15) victory point variances by game end; this contributes to making small mistakes or misreadings in value.

I really like worker placement games. I have not read the novel but I still dig the game.

Pillars was one of the first games I ever played since I entered the hobby in full on 2010.

The board is gorgeous and the game is very easy to learn, it is lighter than Caylus and Agricola so it is not as intimidating to new gamers.

I like this way more than its sequel.

I want to play again soon.

It´s been a long time since I played this, I tried it again yesterday but had to leave the game unfinished :(. I found the game to be still pretty, but now I find the luck inherent in the master builders to be a little excessive. I have to play it again to see if it really bothers me or not. 

The game board is reminiscent of Stone Age, perhaps I will buy the Spanish edition to play with my family.

I managed to play Pillars of the Earth again and it was a very disappointing experience. Now, I feel it is way too light for my current tastes, but what I really dislike in the luck with the bag. In our last game my meeples were taken out of the bag 4 times in a row, even though I put one of them in the bag again. I feel this luck is way too unbalancing and uncontrollable.

Also, there is not anything interesting to do at the end of each round. All the best sport are already taken.

Bottom line, The luck of the draw is too much for me. I will do my best to stay away from this game. I concede it can be a good game to introduce to new players to our hobby. Pillars of the Earth is an average and overrated game, albeit very pretty.

The first time I played I didn't like the game much because I thought you had to have all of the cards memorized and I sat upside down on the game.  I liked the second playing a lot.  It turns out that most of the cards are simply upgrades on the basic cards and the special powers are interesting as well.

RATING: 8
The game unfolds the story of building a cathedral.

Players manage their money for paying labourors or buying the services of artisans. Labourors bring in three different resources which the artisans can convert to browny points for contributing to the cathedral.

Not a lot of player interaction... the interaction is the "I bought something you wanted before you could get to it" variety, but unlike some games in this style there's a fairly good range of usefulness of what's on offer, so the competition is decent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was very high on this game not long ago, which is a testament to the great games that have come out in the past couple years I guess.  

Pillars just seems like a generic convert resource cubes to points game.  I appreciate the effort in trying to blend theme with mechanics, but - why do I care whether I have contributed the most to the cathedral?

The random master builder draw can decide games on its own, and except for the start player no one has the ability to manage it.  That's a major flaw.

- One of my favourite gateway games.
- I'm not sure why, but I really like the aesthetics of the game.
- There's a nice mix of choices, tactics and strategy here. Do you go for a strategy that will produce points early and consistently, or do you go for bulk points later in the game?
- The drawing of pawns from the bag can be both a blessing and a curse. In early rounds, you might not want to be drawn early because of the increased cost. In later rounds you might not care about the cost and desperately want to go sooner in the round.
- Pretty easy to teach, and a great introduction to worker placement, resource management, etc.
- Great with all player counts.

An interesting placement mechanic.  This is another game (like Leonardo) that requires the player to try to maximize his/her efficiency with resources and actions.  A deep game with high replayability.

The game tends to be a bit 'fiddly' with all of the pieces, set up, etc. otherwise I might have rated it higher.That being said, I doubt that I'd turn down a game if offered... it is that good.  I like the mechanisms in play and it has just the right amount or randomness to make every game different.It plays much better on BSW where all the bookkeeping is done for you.

What a let down.  The randomness of the draw takes away too much control IMO.  Of course I'm a huge Caylus fan, so.....  I would play, but it isn't near the top of my list.

Great game, love the gathering of goods to build stuff - in this game and others a like.  I have heard this game called Caylus-lite, which in the gathering of goods to build it is similar.  This game is a good alternative if you are intimidated by Caylus, and is different enough to stand by itself with its own theme.

***********UPDATE 01/29/08***************
Played with the expansion.  Although I really love this game the Expansion for me doesn't make the game better just adds stuff to it (5-6 players/additional cards/board).

2018-02-24 - I initially rated this game a 6, but upon further reflection, I think it's just a 5 for me. There's nothing wrong with it. It's not broken or anything, and it does have some mildly interesting decisions. But it boils down to "get cubes, trade them in for points." It just doesn't hold my interest enough.

RATING: 10
I've played Pillars countless times now and I'm not afraid to rate it a 10. I win Pillars against my family 95% of the times we play, and I can assure you that this game has luck, but is not based on it. The ability to adapt your strategy to random events will always win the day, and there is a feeling of satisfaction everytime you get above (bad) luck.

If you are skillful with maths (as I am) you will have a clear advantage. And that means fun to me, and my game-mates have fun too trying to beat me all the time.

I've been involved in many unlucky situations (my workers drawn last, no money-maker card for me, etc) and still I've won those games. Swear.

This game is fun in many levels and I highly recommend it.

Pillars of the Earth has an enjoyable blend of worker placement and resource management. I enjoy the "grab bag" aspect of determining the order of the workers. This design choice adds a welcome layer of suspense and surprise. It wasn't love at first play, but I'd gladly play again and could see this rating going up.

RATING: 7
Plays well 2-4, though I think I prefer it with 3, then 2, then 4.  With 4, the game is very different, as there are fewer  resource cards available to spend your men on, so they wind up making more money in the Wool Mill.  Similarly, there are fewer spots available to place master craftsmen on, so there are more people on the market and the tax evasion spaces.  All of which cuts down on the choices available, which for me makes it slightly less interesting.

Oh, and the cathedral is stupid, IMO.

This game seemed a little bland. Just collect resources and turn them into pointszzz....and then the pulling of the master builders happened. Wow, that mechanic really makes this game. All of a sudden everyone was involved. This game is one of the best examples of 'sum is greater than its parts'. And a good example of not judging a game before I have played it at least once (just like AoI)

RATING: 8
For a reasonably heavy game, Pillars of the Earth is quite enjoyable to play.  There are many routes to victory.  The values of things in the game change depending on how many rounds are left, and the circumstances of the players.  The graphical quality of the game is amazing.  I play on BSW, but the physical game board looks even better.  Plenty of room for skill, but not overwhelming for beginners, since you can kind of play your own game.  Many similarities with Caylus (everything I have said so far also applies to Caylus!), and the craftsman feature is kind of like the power plants in Power Grid.  Unfortunately, many of the craftsmen are pretty bad, so you end up using only about 2/3 of them.  Also, the cost track doesn't go up high enough in my opinion, and if there is a great craftsman available, the person lucky enough to have their master builder drawn out of the bag first will get it.  Maybe this last criticism is slightly unfair, since the players can earn the right to go first by choosing the cathedral with one of their MBs, but having all those useless bricklayers and mortar-mixers surely could have been avoided with better playtesting.  Even so, this game has a lot going for it.

Típico juego de colocación de trabajadores, visualmente muy atractivo.

Se trata de ir construyendo una catedral mediante la aportación de recursos, aunque en ningún momento da esa sensación.

Al principio de cada turno se consiguen cartas de mejora o de recursos, mediante dinero o trabajadores. Entonces comienza el turno, en el que cada jugador tiene 3 peones que saldrán al azar de una bolsa y que irán determinando el orden de juego y la cantidad de dinero que se pagará por cada acción. Una vez hecho esto, se resuelve el turno según el orden del tablero y al final del turno se cambian recursos por puntos de victoria en una supuesta costrucción de la catedral.

Me parece un juego más de este estilo, que es entretenido para jugar con no jugones. En ningún momento se siente sensación de agobio por no tener dinero, y además, como las cartas se guardan de turno a turno, siempre se van a tener unas acciones mínimas garantizadas, que sólo pueden mejorar. Por último, me parece que el azar de la bolsa de peones puede echar al traste más de una estrategia.

El juego es entretenido, pero está a años luz de Caylus.

RATING: 7
This is a game that was high on the list of "Essen 2006 favorites," and (until recently) I would have had it rated higher, probably an 8.  Experience playing the game in competitive tournament environments like WBC suggests that, while the game might not be "broken," like St. Petersburg, there are issues (1) regarding the relative merits of particular Craftsmen -- i.e., some may be inherently better than others and (2) a tremendous luck factor in the random pulls from the bag.  Replay value, which I initially thought might be quite high, is not that great given that it's the same set of Craftsmen each turn, and it appears that certain strategies seem to always do better -- i.e., get the Money Woodworker on Turn 1, take Start Player on the turn before the really good Craftsmen come out, make sure you get early money (true in alot of similar games, etc.) Now, a recent expansion does go a long way towards correcting these problems, but the learning curve in teaching both the regular game and then the expansion on top of it means the game just isn't hitting the table that often, some two years after the original first appeared.  While I like Pillars better than some of the less interesting Euros such as Caylus (that can drag on a bit), it's just not that interesting any more -- whereas other Essen 2006 releases such as Imperial, Through the Ages and Leonardo da Vinci are still somewhat fresh and new even after repeated plays.

Not bad but I prefer Stone Age. I find this a much more muddy design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tentative rating after one play (which I won).  I prefer the simple elegance of Stone Age.  Both of these games have very good theme-ing until the point of the generation of VPs, which makes very little thematic sense.  Possibly POTE is a bit better but its a marginal call.  I would admire Pillars more if the generation of the VPs actually 'built' the cathedral, rather than it building itself.  Pillars seems far more random and far more 'gamey' than Stone Age too.  Pulling master builders out of the bag in random order seems silly to me.  Perhaps I am being too harsh here ... it is a good game and I will certainly play again!

RATING: 4
I was slow in getting around to Pillars of the Earth. Early comparisons to Caylus convinced me that I should wait - I already liked Caylus, so I wanted to play it some more before checking out Pillars. I needn't have bothered. In Caylus you get the satisfaction of watching a town spring to life. Decisions matter thematically and mechnically; some towns will gentrify early, some will delay moving to stone construction, etc. In Pillars the Cathedral comes together piece by piece (a mere six pieces) no matter what players do; in fact, everyone could go bankrupt and start losing points and that silly cathedral would still rise up in the center of the board. Other quibbles: the game gives you a whole bunch of workers but has you place them in fairly large groups, so you're actually taking very few actions. The actions you do take amount to hiring craftsmen that all do the same thing: convert resources into points (at better rates as the game goes on). The idea is that you're throwing more and more skilled labor and resources at the Cathedral, but in practice you just draft some cards, grab some cubes, and trade those cubes for points based on your cards. It's like Power Grid with a less dynamic resource market... and almost nothing else (board position, player order, etc). Repeat a few times until game end with minor tactical decisions (the board offers a handful of extremely minor supplements, which are themselves attained via a surprisingly random mechanism - the much maligned master-builder draw).

EDIT: Played again about a year later. Confirmed as a very weak game. Take the procedural nature of Caylus and the power-plants of Power Grid, deflate of all depth, inflate with a lot of air, throw in a volatile level of randomness, and you've got Pillars: A ridiculous exercise in one-step cube-to-point conversion. I just don't get what people see in this. My God what a limp game.

RATING: 7.5
Rating after one play.  I think this will be an instant classic in my game group and I think we will be able to finish this game in close to an hour. I'm being modest with my current rating of 7.5.  I could see this game easily becoming an 8.5 maybe even a 9?  I really enjoyed the first play.  Constantly encountering new craftsman, new advantage cards, new events, and different resource cards create some addictive qualities.  

I don’t like how the third master builder you play in a round can some times feel insignificant.  There were several turns where I had nowhere useful to put my third master builder since all other spaces were taken.  This is more of a nitpicky complaint.  I’m also not sure how I feel about pulling the master builders out of the bag.  There were a few instances where one of us had a big advantage because our master builder was drawn rather than someone else’s.  However at the moment I’m not too bothered by this.  Things seem to even out overall, plus there are multiple strategies to victory.

I enjoy most of what this game has to offer. There are some tough choices and the game moves at a good pace. 

The reason I only rate it a 6 is the immense amount of luck in the order the master builders are drawn. The idea is very clever on paper, but in practice it's too much. Someone inevitably suffers unduly at the hand of fate. For me it detracts quite a bit from the play experience.

Comparisons to Caylus are not unwarranted, but what makes Caylus good is that it's so interesting to plan your path.  This game takes that planning and tears it down with random drawing.  Book was quite good however, and I'd highly recommend it.

RATING: 7
One of my favourite worker placement games together with Agricola. The conversion of actions to VP makes planning the moves a bit more obvious than the usage of money as victory condition as in Maestro Leonardo. Once the game is explained everything fits elegantly together and the game flows smoothly. The random elements, especially in the draw of the master builders, didn't annoy me at all as this element is well balanced with the additional costs of placing builders first. The replay value is somewhat limited as experienced players will know which builders come up and prepare accordingly while the variation from events is not too big. But as I rarely outplay any game with the amount of good games available this is neglectable for me.

A great resource/commerce game. The turn order mechanic is one of my favorite things about this game. The expansion makes this game play 5-6. There are a couple downsides: easily predictable turns and lots of fiddly bits. I would really like to play this game more, but Stone Age and Kingsburg tend to get played more often due to the easier setup and quicker playtime. However, Pillars expandability to 6 players allows it to fill a much needed gaming niche for worker placement games.

I'd heard good things about this game and it didn't disappoint.  I think there is a lot of strategy and my lack of experience showed in this game as I passed up some good opportunities.

It's a bit dry, but it's fairly entertaining. I can't see clamoring for it, but I wouldn't run screaming in the other direction if a game were offered. The mechanics are pretty easy to pick up, although they don't sound like they're going to be when you first get going, and I managed to stay competitive in a four-player game (with expansion) my first time out. It's all a bit busy, but maybe I just don't like worker-placement games that much. (I do like Tikal, but I really didn't cotton to Stone Age.)

After one 4-player game, I'd find it hard to choose between this one and Caylus - there are certainly many similarities. This one definitely wins on the presentation front though - fantastic artwork and nice (if sometimes a bit unnecessary) wooden bits. Good box/insert too. I quite like the way your available options (for placing workers) keep increasing and improving in Caylus as the game progresses (they stay pretty much the same here), and the random drawing of Master Builders can be a bit frustrating in PoTE, but on the other hand, I wouldn't mind if Caylus had a little more randomness in it. Our first game took a while, but I imagine PoTE would be shorter than Caylus once you know what you're doing.

I came in to this with very high expectations. But it didn't come together. The game went on for a much longer amount of time than it was worth.

Beautiful art work, with some pretty superfluous components that probably add more to the cost than what it is worth.

I liked a lot of the mechanics to the game, but it seemed like a game ideal with 3-4, not with the 5-6 expansion.

In fact, I would like to play it again with the expansion and only 3-4 people.

RATING: 6
It's hard to not call this "Caylus light" like everyone else does, because it certainly seems that way.  There is considerably more randomness here, which basically manifests itself in the blind draw for placement of master builders.  It does seem like because of the very few variations (the cards are fairly fixed, you know what's going to come out when, with the exception of most of the advantage cards as well as the event cards) replayability may be limited.  I'd like to play this a few more times to see how low the playing time can be.  With the right players, I can play Caylus pretty quickly.  If it's going to take the same amount of time, I would probably prefer Caylus.  The art is nice, but not striking or impressive (at least to me), but then again very few games are.  The cathedral is kind of a cool (if impractical) way to track the rounds.  I would probably enjoy this more if I had read the book, as the advantage and event cards would be more meaningful.

Same rating as for the German version, which I owned first.  I acquired an English language version to go along with the expansion, and also in the hopes of getting people to play, as my game group is not a fan of the game.

This is probably the perfect example of a middle-weight game. It has just the right amount of depth to be fulfilling, but is easy and light enough that it doesn't get bogged down in analysis-paralysis.

Players take turns programming their actions on the board and trying to maximize their VPs per turn. There's nothing too fancy about the mechanisms, except for the fact that player order is random (offset by a higher cost the earlier you play). 

Artwork on the board was great, but the bright colored meeples kinda ruined the muted painting.

This definitely feels like Caylus-lite. The theme is quite similar and there are also some functional similarities. I've only played this with 3 players and think that it would be much more tense with 4. There's some luck involved but it doesn't frustrate.

RATING: 5
This game makes a good first impression but I doubt it will hold up over time. I think the initial discovery phase will be great but that will soon be over. While I am currently enjoying the game I suspect the level of replayability is weak. Caylus gets better the more you play it and holds up well after thousands of plays but I don't see that happening with this game. Pillars may come out because it is hard to find opponents of similar skill levels in Caylus. The luck elements (and the large number of points determined at the end) here should keep less experienced players interested but I still expect newbies to get crushed by those who know the cards. * Update: this game is too long and simplistic to be interesting beyond the first ten games or so. It suffers from the same problem as St. Petersburg where every decision becomes automatic once you understand how the game works for any given number of players. I initially rated the game at 8 but that was based on the initial discovery phase which is fun. If you only intend to play it once a year it may be tolerable.

This is another great worker placement game. I love the structured, multi-phase rounds, the resource gathering mechanism, the different actions, and the Power Grid-like artesan cards, with disadvantages if you get rid of some. It just feels so good to play this game, to see everything you go through in advance. I like the order in this game, but my favorite mechanism is the one adding chaos to the mix: the drawbag turn order. It's just so clever: being picked early gives you the choice between placing now for a premium, or placing first of the non-payers; being picked later costs less, or you can decide to place last; then, being picked late is free and you place them then and there (after those who paid a lot, before those who chose not to pay). It rewards adaptability, there's some nice push your luck in there.

This is actually quite a good worker placement game.  I am surprised when any game based on a TV show/movie/book/video game is good because I assume it was just made for the name and published quickly to make the publisher some quick cash.  But this game really does a nice job of blending theme with balanced and strategic gameplay.  It is a vastly superior game to World Without End IMO.

I always like a sense of escalation in a game and that's one of the things I like about Pillars of the Earth. With the new craftsmen coming out each round you're not only able to make more and more points but the different craftsmen are well connected to the different building stages of the cathedral. The theme of building a cathedral together also helps to create a very satisfying gaming experience.

-THE- Definitive worker placement and German style game, I will never play another euro or worker placement if this is available. Fun, strategic and with just enough randomness thrown in to make the game worth playing again and again and again. Also worthy of note are the excellent quality components and thematic design, extremely unusual for this sort of game.

Easy to learn for BGG'ers (took about 4 min) like Caylus and Leonardo DaVinci with a touch of Shogun/Wallenstein combined (card placement at the bottom of the board). Nice Map. Disappointed that we weren't building the church - and that it was just a turn marker. Nice Box insert. Very interesting mechanic for placing the master builders. Good Game. For what it was it felt a little long (2 1/2 hours). Online (BSW) play is probably much better. I fear if I were to pick this up my group just wouldn't play it enough - for the time involved I'd rather play Caylus. Interesting to say the least. Rating 7.

Update: Rerate to 2. No thank you. Far too much random going on to have any semblance of fun. I will not play this one again. There is no point in it - play musical cubes while getting screwed for no reason. last game I won and I couldn't care less. Done Done and Done.

RATING: 7
Really strong game, themewise and gameplay wise. With 6 plays  under my belt (as of 6/07), I feel the only thing stopping this game from being a real high player on my lists is the luck factor in drawing the master builders. In this, albeit small, sampling of games, too many times has the randomn draw affected my position negatively. (And too few times positively!) :P  I can live with that, some bit of randomness is always fun, imho...but it prevents this from being a big-time game...

Excellent worker placement game.
Really like the whole 5 man crew thing. Do think the "these three workers are pivotal! Don't sell them for these reasons" is kinda overblow. Depending on your other workers you can usually replace at least 2 off them withour any issue.

Great art. I'm curious about the expansion but price and limited availability makes me not all that interested.

RATING: 7
This game is so much like Puerto Rico it hurts, though rather than "roles" you select different aspects of cathedral production to work on, there are fewer commodities which also fulfil the role of colonists, and there aren't quite so many ways of accumulating VPs, though that's not to say that there aren't plenty of strategies for winning. I won this the first time I played it by pouncing on a couple of pricey craftsmen that give you VPs every turn and turn wood into coins early on. It meant I was broke for a little while, but I was able to come back strong later. All in all, it's a fun game, a little simpler than PR. There are some odd production omissions. Player mats are sorely needed. The board, though beautiful, looks disorganized and muddled. The cathedral pieces are nice, but I was also left with a question: if you're supposed to put the roof on in the beginning of the sixth turn, why is the game still continuing? The cathedral's already been built! Maybe I misread the rules, and since the cathedral pieces are just for flavor, it's nothing that matters; just another glitch in this game's matrix. I would definitely play it again, but it's not as elegant as PR, and owning both would be a waste.

Saw the game at the local game store, didn't think anything of it.  Then one day, by chance, I hear Oprah introduce the auther of the book the game is based on as one of her booklist authers, and I stop to listen.  I still have yet to read the book, but the game at the very least is beautiful and well designed.

Based on 10+ plays.  Pillars is a pleasant enough middle-weight resource-management game.  While certainly enjoyable, it doesn't really have any special quality to distinguish it from the loads of other middle-weight resource-management games on the market right now.  I prefer Notre Dame and the like to it, but am still happy enough to play.  The luck factor is a touch high for my tastes, but not as offensive as others have made out.

2016-11-27 - 7 - I'm after one play with cards from the expansion, but without the additional board. Right after our game I thought it was good, but not very good. But after a while I started to think that I would really like to play it again, so it might grow on me. I really like how strong the theme is integrated with the mechanics, usually that's something important to me.

2017-05-11 - 7->6.5 - I played with 5 players and with the expansion. The expansion is pretty good and adds interesting actions. 
However I have two or three issues with the game. 
It's too long for what it is, not being too heavy at the same time.
It's slow. You get point after point after point. It speeds with following rounds up but not too much.
It misses some spark. Misses some intriguing way to achieve goals. Some opportunity to make a big satisfying move.
I will still play it if someone asks, but I don't need to own it.

The Good: This is a fun strategy game that plays faster than most of it's peers. The board has beautiful artwork that really fits the theme well.Lots of good decisions to be made each turn, yet with little analysis paralysis.

The Bad: Some may complain about luck. Luck is present due to deciding turn order by pulling pieces out of a bag. However, the early pieces out of the bag must pay extra for their turn. I believe this works fairly well in a 2 player game. However, I feel that the luck of the draw plays more of a factor with more than 2.

By far one of the best games I've ever played.  The game is gorgeous to look at and the game system very easy to follow.  I really like the "follow the steps around the board" concept.  It allows everyone to not have to remember what happens next and with so many options to select from with only the three master builders and competition for spots.  

The funny part is I played this game with guy that plays mostly miniatures and he really, really liked the game so that right there is gives it a glowing approval rating.

Though 10+ years old now, only just beginning to show its age. A great 2nd step game after gateway fare like TtR and Catan. Board layout is pleasing to the eye, a subtle blend of form and function. Perhaps too straightforward of a worker placement affair for those seeking a heavier Euro.

Beautiful components with a rather familiar gameplay: collecting cubes and transforming these cubes into victory points via worker cards while making sure not to run out of money. The fixed order for the craftsmen reduces the replayability. The main element of luck comes from the way the master craftsmen are drawn each round and when you are unlucky, then the best spots are already taken (I would prefer a mechanism in which you take an action to impact the playing order, e.g. like is done in Age of Empires III). The game tension/suspense is low (e.g. there is no urge to build anything special or to prevent your workers from starving). In summary: the game is too long for what it is and too luck based for what it wants to be. Don't enjoy this one at all.

Good worker placement game. Game gives a very big advantage to someone who knows all the cards coming up as apposed to someone new who doesn't know the game. If there were more cards and more uncertainty as to which cards would be coming up this would be altogether a better game, it does however work well playing with people who all know the cards and what they need to plan for.

RATING: N/A
At the beginning of the 13th century, construction of the greatest and most beautiful cathedral in England begins. Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral's construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points. Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points. Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game. Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points. Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen. Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.

RATING: 7.5
[2007.May.24] This resource conversion game is a gorgeous production that very nicely mirrors the book that it is based upon. It drips with theme, but is also a compelling game. As stated, the object of the game is simple: convert your resources to victory points. However, since luck is an issue--especially during craftsmen/resource card and master builder placements--players should be flexible with their strategies in order to be able to adjust them mid-game.

The game handles 2- and 3-players exceptionally well, but may play a bit too long for some with 4-players. (Perhaps with non-AP-prone players this may not be the case.)

[2016.Feb.2] Still a dependable "go to" in my collection, even after all these years. The expansions certainly gave it longer legs.

Very, very nice game.  A rare balance of strategy, tactics, reacting, planning and randomness.  Playable with almost any group and enjoyable by players with vastly different levels of experience.  Under the hood it's a worker placement game with resource gathering, construction & feeding of your simple personal victory point engine (worker cards), with a nice, well integrated, theme.  (The game actually led me to discover the books, and not the other way around.)

It flows well, everyone I explained it to got it, it's pleasant to all levels of players, keeps everyone interested throughout and has an ok length.  This is my top rated game despite me not being able to identify or pinpoint a clear reason.  It's just one of the top, best constructed, play experiences around.  Obviously you can find better games for a set group, but in absentia, you can't go wrong with Pillars.

In many cases, a significant part of your score is derived from the final round or two, where the highest-scoring or highest-income producing cards come into play.  But, there is no guarantee that certain cards will come into play so many other games will be very close.  I also really like Cuba (same team of designers).

RATING: 5
Beautiful board and solid play.  This is another efficiency game all about maximizing your actions.  Each turn consists of 3 phases: 1. Purchasing craftsmen OR assigning workers to a quarry, forest, or sand pit, 2. 3 masterbuilders from each player are mixed and randomly drawn from a black bag which then are placed (at cost which reduces by 1 gold for each masterbuilder placed and begins at 7 gold to place first) at various spots on the board which allows special actions during phase 3, 3. Going through the board and completing 14 mini-phases which is basically handing out free stuff or actions depending on where you placed your master builders.  After my first play, it feels light in nature but with quite a few difficult decisions as you seek to maximize your opportunities to score victory points.  I did not find the German language edition to be all that much of a problem as its easy and quick to refer to the translations for the cards.  However, the replayability of this game died in a hurry for me as it soon felt like there were only a couple tracks to victory and not many dynamic changes at any point in the game other than in the random master builder draw.

RATING: 6
Many people know that I am no Eurogamer. Based on the story, this Eurogame has beautifully illustrated components and a very standardize game mechanic - you resolve what happens in that medieval "Church" age one by one - events by the God, tax collection, taking special characters (advantage cards) or more efficient craftsmen (privilege cards), resources production, calling for more workers, commercial activities in market and then deciding who is going to be the new starting player. This is the kind of game more suitable to the wargamer like me, favoring a more clear and structured sequence of play. 

The game basically is about scoring victory points along the way, producing resources for the Church building earns you victory points. You can also "buy" victory points with goldsmith (and I like this mechanic very much!). I was in the lead for a long time but in the last turn a decision not to take the privilege with the master builders in Shiring (yep, I don't know why the place is called so but it is in the game anyway). John had been monopolizing the metal resources and in the end, won the game with a higher grade goldsmith. 

The game is not necessarily competitive among the players but how one gets the job done the most efficient way. It is not as abstract as other mathematical Eurogame, although I still feel some parts of the game are not so much related to the theme but just a way to proceed the game. I can't say it is a good game because I am not immensely satisfied with the completion of the game, but I can't say it either it is not a good game because of its clean, simple and straightforward mechanic. Well, it really depends on the liking of individual gamer after all.

Was thinking about buying this a while back, but discouraged by the play time and the relatively limited player range.  Having played it, I'm gutted: while it is worker placement (my 2p partner's least favourite mechanic), I think the abstraction isn't as heavy as Caylus, and think Pillars plays much quicker than the stated play time.  Would have to play again, but wouldn't be surprised if I upped my rating.

A fantastic game that should get far more love and distribution.  The worker placement is always tense and exciting; I love the mechanism for converting resources into points; the mechanism for drawing workings is so unique and sets this WP apart from the others.

This is a very solid worker placement game. There are so many options each round, but they get taken so quickly and you can only choose three! It's very, very thinky when it comes to the worker placement and each round is pretty tense as everyone is vying for the best places.

RATING: 5
Pretty to look at, but there is absolutely nothing new here. I can't imagine anyone still being excited about this after three plays. I don't mind randomness in a game, but in this one it's just silly: when your turn randomly comes up, choose the best of what's left, which is usually pretty obvious. The randomness may interfere with strategy, but that's hard to say since there doesn't seem to be much room for strategy. WAY overhyped.

A "make cubes into something else" game. This is the accurate explaining of the game, really...

All the mechanics don't come together at all, it seems you're just getting cubes without any strategic decision at all. The luck (a thing I really like) really hurts this game, the "pull a pawn off a bag" mechanic seems utterly useless, it just gives randomness to a game that doesn't need/want more. The board and the art are beautiful, but it makes the game more confusing and even more pointless, just a charade to cover the game suckness. I've never thought I say this, but the game plays itself, after making 1-2 decisions to none, the game quickly becomes a machine telling you that you suck at making decisions. There's so much to think about and at the end all you have to do is: 

Place workers
Plan how to get cubes
You get Cubes
You trade Cubes for VP's

This over 6 rounds of play made me want to puke. I tried again to give it another chance... and its just the same.

This 4 is because of the art, and nothing more

RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable game with lot of choices to make without too much over-analysis.
Negative points explanation :
- With 4 players there is too much luck involved when blindly picking colors out of the bag, it's perfect for 3.
- We never even take out the cathedral out of the box, it has nothing to do with any gameplay element, so the theme did fail here a bit.

RATING: 4
Possibly one of the prettiest games I own. Unfortunately initial plays left me a little flat. The randomness of the master builders was too much for my gaming buddies. The programed nature of the game didn't allow for the creativity I like when playing games, which results in a certain lack of control. (Do you play the game, or does it play you?)

In retrospect, I wonder if we were playing this game all wrong. The game presents itself as a gamer's game with an elaborate board, many bits, and lots of steps per turn. In reality, however, I wonder if this was supposed to be a fairly light game in a fancy package? I will need to play again to confirm.

Update: 
Too much rule explanation for non-gamers. Too much randomness for gamers. 

Traded.

RATING: 5
Despite the artwork and theme, the actual gameplay felt very dry and mechanical---conceptually, it felt a lot more like [GAMEID=9217] or [GAMEID=36218] (games we disliked) rather than [GAMEID=31260], despite sharing a similar worker placement mechanism.  I think the problem for us was that in [GAMEID=24480], the resources have no differentiation in function---they could be anything.  You're just mechanically turning some random resource into points at some point in the game.  The resources themselves don't actually do anything as they do in [GAMEID=31260], where you can build a resource engine and then get victory points.  Although both schemes end up at the same place, it's that middle step of actually building something that we really like---in [GAMEID=31260], you have to get specific resources to build specific resource engines that then earn you points.  For example, we also really like games like [GAMEID=278] and [GAMEID=28143], which also contain these elements.  In contrast, in [GAMEID=24480], there's nothing to distinguish one resource from another.  As she said after the game, "It doesn't matter what the resources are.  They might as well be fish for all that it matters".  There was no more connection to the resources---it was merely an abstract, accountant's optimization exercise.  This is where I understood the term "cube pushing".

It also felt like there weren't too many actual decisions in the game.  It's usually the same resource cards that pop up and the same craftsmen that are available each game.  You get a lot of workers, but that's deceptive as most of the resource cards require a large number of workers anyway.  You also only get three master builders for the real worker placement mechanism.  Don't get me wrong, there are definitely decisions that you can optimize to win the game, but it just felt dry and less interesting to us.

While she really didn't like it, I tolerated it.  However, ultimately any time we would bring this out, we would just rather play [GAMEID=31260] instead.

An excellent rhythm and structure to the game which eases you through what appears at first to be quite a daunting experience and turns Pillars of the Earth into compelling gameplay.

As the game was explained to us I could only stare at the text-heavy rule book and think they must of just extracted the book.  However, after one round was played everyone, knew what was going on and further reference to the rule book was not needed.

It must be said that we were a good group to test a game out.  4 of us, including 3 good players and 1 bad (me).  3 fast and 1 slow (not me).  3 battling for the lead and 1 watching it at a safe distance from behind (me).  Each player though, it appeared, enjoyed the game whatever the skill level, speed of turns and position on the scoreboard.  Enough decisions to be involved but not enough to paralyse.  Elements of randomness but still enough control to focus on tactics and have a hint of overall strategy.

A very good game which with a good explainer of rules could be a viable choice for most groups.

Played on BSW. Fundamentally a nice design, but a couple of highly unnecessary and annoying inelegancies, especially the three craftsmen that have odd powers, spoil this otherwise highly engaging heavyweight. In fact, they are annoying enough to drop Pillars from a must buy to the bottom of my might want list. Still, I'm willing to continue playing, at least on BSW, for now.

Comparisons to Caylus, as such comparisons tend so often to be, are superficial (based largely on the master builder placement mechanic and the building-a-large-medieval-structure theme), and ultimately unenlightening.

UPDATE: Haven't really been playing this, although I bear it no real ill will. Nevertheless, I'm dropping my rating a point due to lack of interest.

UPDATE: I just played this again on BSW for the first time in a while, and time away has not done it any favours. I don't think there's anything wrong, exactly, with worker placement as a mechanism, but playing Pillars again just showed me that no one has tried anything more than throwing it in with a melange of loosely connected, unfocused, resource management mechanics (CAVEAT: I haven't played Leonardo daVinci or Agricola). I think a good game designer could make something fun of this, but I have yet to see it.

Purely mechanical exercise with a theme that provides the appropriate atmosphere but has little to do with the actual game play. There's a great big cathedral in the center and I am ... earning Victory Points? Oh. How about at least calling them Prestige?

The theme drips all around everything, though none ever gets on you directly (so you won't need to wear a smock). However, this 'mechanism in search of a game' which is 1 part [GameID=555] and 1 part [GameID=9217], is *good*. It's a good length, with great action choices and lush bits.

I think 3 players might be 'optimum', but won't swear to it (good with any number).

i was attracted to this game when i first discovered bgg.  after a lot of back and forth trying to decide whether to purchase it or trade for it, i decided it wasnt for me because of the more abstract nature and the disappointment that the cathedral is just a time marker.

eventually i got it in a math trade and it turns out that i do enjoy this game.  collecting cubes and creating some kind of engine to turn them into points is somehow enjoyable for me.

This worker placement game never really seems to take advantage of its -- well advantages. Part of this is the design decisions made by the publisher/designer. The wooden cathedral in the game serves only as a round marker. Goods are converted directly into VP, robbing the players of any sense of accomplishment. There are so many places where the game could have been enhanced with the inclusion of a simple rule or description. As worker placement games go, this is an okay one, but I think there are much better ones out there.

Pillars of the Earth is a worker placement game with resource collection.  You allocate a number of workers to collect various resources and then you draw builders from a bag and can place them earlier if have the money to pay for it.  Otherwise you defer your turn until later.  You acquire buildings to transform resources into parts of a Cathedral that you build during the game.  The board is one of the best boards every made and you actually have little wooden pieces as a turn tracker.  

The game will remind you have Stone Age if you have played Stone age but it is just slightly heavier than Stone Age.  A little heavier than family weight but if you kids have played games this is a one that is great for 10 and up.

With a 2 hour playtime this might not be the best game until heavier/longer games have been played more frequently.

On the other hand, Tom Vasel's review at RPG sings the praises for this game (and reinforces how it's a great Caylus lite in it's easier and quicker play): "Few games blow me away with positive impressions as Pillars of the Earth did. Not only do I consider it one of the best games of 2007 – award worthy, even – but also it could easily become one of my favorite games. Playing well with two to four players, Pillars of the Earth has a building mechanic that takes place over six rounds, giving players choices similar to the smash hit Caylus, but in a quicker timeframe. I enjoy the escalating game play, and the games I’ve played have stayed close and tense throughout the entire game. Pillars of the Earth may look like a hodge podge of typical game components and mechanics, but it really is a special breakout, and I can see it becoming quite popular due to easy game play (enhanced by the theme) and tremendous interaction. "


See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/436624

It seems that people are torn between this vs. Stone Age. It seems that it isn't worth owning if one already has Stone Age (and esp. if one isn't necessarily looking for more in depth game play than Stone Age; which PotE seems to be).

Caylus and Agricola are more engaging versions this game.

Nicer looking board than Notre Dame. Which says a lot considering that Stone Age really is a hit due to it's gorgeous game board (which serves to draw you into the theme).

CONCLUSION: Worth getting (before Notre Dame - see my comments there) if the price is right.

POST-SCRIPT: Maybe not worth getting at all. 
See: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/441850/family-focus-reviews-the-pillars-of-the-earth esp. with the following summary: "The Pillars of the Earth is a decent worker placement game that perhaps just tries too hard. The artwork is beautiful, the production value is good, and the mechanic behind the game is one of my favorites. However, the implementation of this mechanic is complex and clunky. This one flaw, for my family, greatly detracts from the fun factor of the game. I would recommend against The Pillars of the Earth for a casual gaming family. Instead, I would suggest Stone Age (as mentioned above), a more simplistic take on the same genre…and a more family friendly alternative while maintaining a strategic gameplay style which can be enjoyed by everyone."

NB: I suspect that there are many more games to play out before this one will become a staple in the game library

RATING: 7
12/2007  After a third game, now with most rules played correctly, this game is still going strong.  Very well balanced - where subtle stragegies, selections and flexibility (and a little luck) can give you the upper hand.  The average game will clock in at around two hours.  Time flies though as everyone is occupied and engaged all the time.  Looking forward to further plays.

5/2009 6 player game with expansion.  The expansion is a good addition making room for the added players.  It's a longer game but still within acceptable limits.

Interest for the game has fallen with time.  There's a feeling of the game playing you rather than you playing the game.  There's very little effort distinguishing victory and a mediocre result.Rating down 8->7.

RATING: 7.5
Good game, didn't seem like Caylus-lite despite the frequent comparisons. Tight game, money and actions are close, and the events and drawing of the builders adds just the right amount of luck for replayability without taking too much away from planning. For the length especially, a good playing experience.

RATING: 9
The most beautiful game I know - and among the very best when it comes to mechanics.
It borrows shamelessly from Caylus & Sct. Petersburg, but betters them both.

I think there are a little too few craftsmen in the base game, but with all expansions, there are enough.

It's a usual "collect resources and convert them into VP" game, with a "draft" mechanic (you choose what to do by placing your men in specific areas) and quite a bit of randomness (order of play, available resources, event cards,...). 
It is unoriginal, shallow and offers little control (especially with more players).
Nice bits.

Yes, I can see how some people would make comparisons to Caylus and call this a lighter version, but it really does stand on its own.  Despite the card-driven mechanic, the game shines for ease of play and (as many have already stated), it's freakin' beautiful!  I have enjoyed every game, and can't wait to get it on the table again.
[b]Update:[/b]  I've come to the conclusion that I will never win this game, but I will always enjoy playing it.  It's that good.  However, I've lowered the rating due to the fact that it is so rarely played.  Most of my group like it, but hardly anyone suggests it.

A nice game that probably will benefit of a little more variety.

For me it makes a good 2 player game, but I'm not to sure about 3 or 4 players, it seems that there are not enought interesting options to choose from when playing with more than 2 players, and I think that with more than 2 players the luck factor is just too much. I've read that the expansion for 5-6 players address some of these problems like variety and lack of good actions to choose from, but I can't comment as I don't own the expansion.

This game definitely needs more than two players. It lacks a sense of tension with two, even with a variant to tighten up the board.

I also found that it felt like the mechanics were showing a bit too much. I love euro games, but in this one, I felt like I was simply getting cubes to convert them to victory points. 

In the end, we'd always choose to play Stone Age over this, so we decided to trade it away.

Pillars is a lot less complicated that the number of bits it includes might suggest, and it's a ton of fun to play. The components are beautiful, and it evokes the book quite well -- but is just as enjoyable if you've never read the book.

The turn order, taxation, and role selection are well implemented, and they combine to make every turn a rich decision with a good amount of room to be surprised by how things shake out. Just a solid game all around.

The event deck is poorly implemented to me since certain good things that happen resolve after it is too late to really be taken advantage off. You basically get the reward more on a random basis versus planned and in at least one case you have to screw up to get the advantage. Outside of that, I think it more than holds its own against a game like Lords of Waterdeep. Pillars has more places for placement so there is more of an initial learning curve and likely more depth overall, but that's about it.

Just base game notes here. 

I like the game, the theme, the artwork and the experience. I definitely like having all the options and the little bit of variety from the card mechanics. However, I simply cannot stand the turn order mechanism. Many have noted that here and I can’t even believe that ever passed play-testing. That, and the length of the game, really ruin it. 

It has a decent learning curve and the first time can bog, but repeat plays are good. Yet, as much as I like this, for some reason I’m left with a feeling of “that wasn’t as much fun as the time invested”. I can’t put my finger on it just yet. Still, if you can find a copy cheap and are looking for something new, then you could do worse.

I think it will depend on my mood :) Definitely worth a few plays.

I was very happy to finally be able to add this game to my collection. It has a really cool worker placement approach, all of your workers go into a cloth bag, and are then drawn one at a time. The first worker drawn has first rights to go first, but it is expensive to go first, so passing becomes an option. If you pass, however, you are guaranteed to be one of the last to go, but it won't cost you anything. Each player has three workers to randomly go through this process with.

Also, the round marker is a wooden cathedral that is put together to signal that the game end is near.

Caylus Lite.  I loved Caylus, but it was far too long for me.  This one is great, there's nice tension between your choices, and while some people don't like the randomness of the master builder draw, it does not bother me.

Our first play was enjoyable enough, even if 2 players is surely not its best player count. I got this game in a math trade for a game that fell flat for us, so I was satisfied with the exchange. It probably won't stay in our collection forever, though. Other WPs like Village feel just a little bit fresher and more enjoyable in comparison.

Sold in May'16 because we have many worker placement games which work better with 2.

Raised 2 points to the rating since it is an adaptation of a medieval theme novel instead of a vampire TV series. The game itself: random turn over - It deprives the chance to plan ahead which means everything in a worker placement game and leaves the soulless body floating on a gloriously decorated game board.

Though the rules are not very difficult to grasp, I afraid my non-gamer friends will find this boring so I would not recommend this to them.

RATING: 6
Rather convoluted and daunting for a newbie due to the myriad of options one is confronted with. It took me more than half my first game to figure out what was going on. That put a damper on any enjoyment I could glean from the game. I enjoyed it more in later games once I got over the hefty learning curve. Many people compare it to Caylus. I agree. They mean it as praise. I don't.  
As of 05/01/13 I've played 12 times, about half of those with the 5/6 player expansion.

Great builder placement game.
Not too long(like Caylus) or too short (Leonardo Da Vinci). One of the most gorgeous artwork I've seen in boardgames. Good mechanics, a little more on the luck side than Caylus, but feel like a better experience.
Can't wait to get the expansion for it.

Because the game is a bit card driven, I don't think my rating will stay that high after several plays, but until then we are having a blast with every games.

Rating based on two plays, one with 4 players and one with 3.  Enjoyed it very much.  I enjoy this one more than Caylus - it's just more fun.  The comparisons between the two are obvious.  For some reason I enjoyed this one a lot, but I'm not sure if it would have as much replayability.  With my playing habits, it doesn't really matter because I'm unlikely to play it enough to find out.

This rating would likely improve with more plays.  I've really enjoyed my plays of Pillars, but I've only gotten the chance to play with 2 players and in that case, all of the games we've played have felt very similar.  I think more players would go a long way towards increasing my enjoyment of this one.  It's a very well designed game, I can't fault it for that.  I somewhat dislike the simple "grab and score" mechanic, as I prefer to have more options available for using goods and earning victory points.  But there are enough significant and important decisions to be made throughout this game that I still end up enjoying playing it.

One play. So far it played out pretty well (only two players). The randomness of the master builder draw was kind of nice with two players actually. Some interesting choices in selecting craftsmen and earning points/money. Have to see how it A) plays with more and B) Stands up to repeated playings.

I like it enough to have picked up the expansion and look forward to playing it!

A few more plays in and I really do like this game. Seems to last just long enough and with enough choices to keep things interesting.

A very smart and elegant game with lots to explore and chat about afterwards.  A bit of a ramp up with the rules, but not too bad overall.  It will take an actual turn or two to get the hang of it, but it's quite cool thereafter.  With three players, we managed to stay out of each others way for the most part, but I could see how this could get testy with repeated plays.  Fine components and a good time had by all.

A really neat worker placement game, which basically have two separate worker placement segments within a single game round, as you first send your workforce to retrieve resources or to generate income, then there's a bag drawing sequence where as your tokens are pulled out, you may choose to pay money to place it and secure you the spot you need right away, or to wait and later place it for free, but the spot you want the most might already be taken.

Each round resolves the actions in a set order and culminate in another section of the cathedral being built.

I think the theme is really woven nicely into this game. I don't mind the randomness of the bag-draw. Bad draws just add to the strategy required to win. One complaint I have about the game is that the early builders are a little unbalanced. The one that gives you money every turn can be overly powerful. Other players struggle for money round after round, while one player just rakes in the gold.

This game will always have a place in our hearts, as it was the game that got us hooked on modern gaming.  The first year we owned this we just couldn't get enough of it.  The game looks nice, it has a Catholic theme, and introduced us to the the joy that is resource management games.  If I had rated it back then it would have received a much higher score.  Having played other games, we find this game less balanced.  There are certain cards such as Prior Philips that if one of us receives it early in the game we are almost guaranteed the victory.  It got to the point that if this card showed up in the first three rounds we replaced it with a different card.  We play most of our games two player, so this is the basis for the majority of my ratings.  With two the amount of choices seem too much for your master builders, and with four the options seem too scarce.  Also, the actions you take don't seem to relate to building the Cathedral, whereas in some other games all of your actions make intuitive sense with the goal of the game, such as the concept of establishing a farm in Agricola (yeah, that's my favorite game).  Thinking of this game will always bring with it a sense of warmth and nostalgia, as it was the gateway to so much joy in our lives.

Reminds me a lot of Caylus, but not as complicated to explain. I rank this game much lower because the strategy is very much "rinse, repeat" and I was getting bored after 4 rounds (out of 6). Not a good sign. And, while the game is much easier to explain than Caylus, it doesn't seem to play all that much faster. The game also felt very dry and is the first Euro (even though this is my 540th rated game) that makes me feel like a cube-pusher. Put some meeples on some spaces to get some cubes. Sell cubes for VPs. DO this 6 rounds in a row. Blah!!!

RATING: 6
This is an interesting game, but my initial rating is still fairly low. Why? It all boils down to luck. You can play a good game, leading by 4-5 points before the 6th round (that is plenty in this game) and have a good amount of money, only needing a good craftsman to secure the victory - then you get screwed by the Master Builder draw. Suddenly all you can hope for is to salvage what little is left, which is basically nothing. No, too much luck for my taste.

This struck me as a combination of Leonardo da Vinci and Caylus, which is a good thing as I love both those games.  This is a resource acquisition and management game where players must allocate workers to buy resources and/or special abilities, and then spend those resources to obtain victory points.  I didn't like it quite as much as Leonardo or Caylus (it had more limited hcoices than either of those two games, and thus required much less tactical thinking), but it was still fun to play.

2017.08.: Ez annyira német volt, hogy fél év után bontatlanul eladtam. Adja magát a kérdés, hogy akkor mi a rongyosra kopott dobozsarok miatt vettem meg?! Pánik. Valószínűleg pánik lehetett, hogy OoP a doboz és gyorsan akkor legyen meg inkább németül. Hibáztam. Láttam pár hete angol kiadását valahol. Boldogság.

Update: Persze miután eladtam, vettem csak észre, hogy az új JEM-ben ott vannak a magyar kártyák szépen beszerkesztett, nyomdakész pdf-ben...

2017.11.: Megvettem újra a német verziót. Ennyi előjáték után, ha nem fog tetszeni, komolyan dühös leszek a német társasjáték iparra.

2018.01.: Hosszú előjáték után végre kipróbálásra került (magyarított kártyák kinyomtatva, mi bajom lehet?!).

A játék bonyolultnak tűnhet elsőre a sok helyszín miatt, de gyorsan átláthatóvá válik. Az illusztrációk szépek, a tábla igazi Menzel-munka, ötletes a bábuk megkülönböztetése (kis munkás, nagy munkás, építész, fekete munkás, szürke munkás). A mechanizmusok közül az építészek lehelyezése egyedi, máshol (még) nem láttam ezt a megoldást.

A játék egyébként sajnos elég száraz, A-t váltunk át B-re vagy C-t B-re, esetleg D-t A-ra, vásárolunk olyan kártyákat, amikkel kedvezőbb átváltási arányokat érhetünk el. Hiába vannak korhű elnevezések (pl. üvegfúvó), ha ugyanúgy Y nyersanyagból csinál X pontot. Persze szinte minden eurós játék ilyen, talán az is baj, hogy ezt kb. 200 másik eurós után ismertem meg.

A játék szárazságán sajnos az eseménykártyák és előnykártyák sem változtatnak sokat, mert ezekből meg olyan kevés van, hogy hiába marad ki minden játékból 4 db, attól még mindig ugyanazok a kártyák kerülnek majd elő.

Jó iparosmunka, de semmi több. Anno, mikor megjelent, biztosan a legjobb eurós játékok közt emlegették (joggal). Ettől függetlenül nem volt rossz vele játszani, de már vannak ennél jóval szórakoztatóbb eurók is... Ennek ellenére még napjainkban is színvonalas játéknak számít.

Ha valaki egyszer azt kérdezi majd, hogy mondjak neki egy igazi klasszikus, ízig-vérig eurós játékot, ami még szép is, ez lehet az egyik, amit javasolni fogok. Főleg, ha Ken Follett rajongó.

Nice resource optimization with some good tension (two-player game was stale, though) and some luck of the draw to balance things. Probably too much luck for the hard core crowd - go play Caylus instead!

I didn't find the luck excessive. As the same craftsmen come in same order in each game, experience is rewarded there. Still, bad master builder draw can ruin the best laid plans! If you hate uncertainty, you'll loathe this game, I suppose.

Indifferent.

Fantastic, thoughtful fun. I think what I like is that I am always faced with hard choices, and the result of those choices is not always clear.

For some reason I tend to struggle in the end-game during the final round. Still I seem to win about half the time.

It feels far more tense than Stone Age, and it actually sees table play, compared to Agricola. I appreciated Follet's novel (and the sequel) and so the theme gives it a nice flavor. That said, in the end, I found Age of Empires III to be the superior game.

A flawed game due to the greatest advantage lies in being first player on every turn. Which honestly makes it a somewhat broken game seeing how any player who does not prioritize becoming the starting player will be at such a disadvantage that winning will not be an option for them.

I haven`t made my mind about this one yet. Pillars is very similar to Stone Age but resources are harder to get and I am not sure if I like the randomness in the master builder placement. Too few games played to be able to say anything else. A the moment I prefer Stone age over this.

Pillars plays in three phases. There's a fairly standard phase of card purchase, followed by a worker placement phase, and then a scoring phase where you take earned resources and convert them to points. The three parts of the game tie together nicely. I really enjoy how workers are pulled from a bag in the second phase. Earlier draws need to pay a higher fee for placing their worker, or pass and possibly lose out on high value spaces, but place later for free. All together, it seems nicely balanced with several possible routes to victory.

RATING: 9
The book is a must read and the game stayed "relatively" close to the book.  This a very good game with intriguing "machine-mechanics."  What I mean be "machine-mechanics" is that you can configure certain cards to build a "machine" that takes a raw material input (e.g., stone, wood, sand, etc.) and produce victory points, money, etc. as an output. If you want to play a whole game based purely on "machine-mechanics" try Infernal Contraption or Magic: The Gathering (especially the Mirrodin Set).  It is a somewhat light game that should be fun for families, however, the mechanics are advanced enough to deter some "nongamers."

Most accessible (the wife may actually play it) of the worker placement type games.  Very happy with it.  Seems to take 2 hours with 4 people, wish we could get it down to 90 minutes.

I've played many of the new worker placement type games, and this one just happens to hit my sweet spot.

Caylus = Complex & Dry.

Agricola = Too complex (too many cards and worker locations to keep track of).  Not sure all cards are balanced?  Seems like some cards are definitely better than others.

Stone Age = Light & fun, but a bit tedious with the dice rolling.  Actions are pretty mechanical and repetetive.

This game puts the components above the gameplay: it could be easily streamlined (why not have a track for the workers in the same way that money is handled?) so that there is less to do.
For the time it takes to play this game, it doesn't offer enough long term strategy. Due to the luck of the draw it is largely tactical.

Very good game.  Beautiful gameboard and nice components.  Feels like a simplified version of Caylus, which I consider good because that avoids a bit the analysis paralysis from that game as well...  Very elegant gameflow that pushes the game forward, and almost no downtime at all.  Plays in exactly 2 hours every time it seems.

Also, plays very well with 2.  With 4 is the sweet spot for me as the spots to place your Architects becomes very contested.

After downgrading Caylus, I was looking for a game like this that is simpler, more fun, a little more random but not much yet retains the out positioning aspect that I enjoy so much.  Multiple routes to victory have been demonstrated repeated despite early suspicion that first round wood to money carpenter is just too strong....it is not the case, but he still helps.  The artwork is just absolutely beautiful...makes me want the read the book....the replayability is just fabulous and it works with 2-4 all equally well and my 10 year old daughter now loves this game and asks to play it all the time with me or my friends when they come over....love to see her explain to new players as she gets the game so well.  ;-)

Elegant, tense, and with a cleverly implemented theme. While I must admit I was just a bit disappointed by the fact that the cathedral gets built no matter what the players do, the progress of the events and the gradual improvement of the craftsmen create a nice sense of progression and achievement.
While there's little in the way of direct player interaction, the jostling for cards and board positions keeps things tense and competitive.
And it plays just great with just 2, which is always nice.

RATING: 7
Theme is based on buiding a cathedral in 12th century England. Using the mechanic of placing workers into areas (like Caylus), earn gold, get resources (sand, wood or stone) and convert resources into VPs.  The trick in this game is that everyone has 3 workers to place, but they are all put into a bag and pulled out randomly. The first workers out have to pay a higher cost in gold to be placed. There are many things to keep track of, and there is the tension of trying to get the right craftsman first or produce the right resources while balancing your money.  This is a decent game, and needs more plays to understand the nuances.

My only complaint with this game (and granted, it can be a big factor in your enhjoyment) is that the luck in pulling the master builder pieces can overwhelm the game once in a while, either giving someone a huge advantage or hamstringing someone to the point of no return.

Good game, but some of the advantage cards are unbalanced, e.g. getting a wood per turn or an extra worker becomes pretty useless on round 5. The cards should have provided a choice between two options instead. The game would benefit from more available locations (e.g. gambling house) as the last picks generally feel kinda irrelevant in a 4-player game. Best recommended with 3 players.

RATING: 6
Pillars of the Earth is a beautiful game. Its cards and board are finely detailed, but not overly busy. Although superfluous, its turn counter is the best I've ever seen. The wooden components are colorful and easy to differentiate. The box insert, while thematic, unfortunately doesn't separate the game pieces very well.

The main problem with PotE is that the game rewards players who specialize in a single Resource more than those that try a more balanced approach. After a single game, most players will recognize this fact and specialize in every future play-through. Because there are only 3 basic Resources, this trend towards specialization will undermine any competition for Craftsmen or Resources, removing important tension from a 2-3 player game. In a 4-player game competition is restored, but likely only for 1 Resource. The 2 players competing for the same Resource will have lower scores than the 2 that have no competition. This single flaw cripples PotE as the result of each game can be predicted based on what players did in turn 1.

No change in PotE's superb game mechanics would have been necessary to solve this problem either. What is needed is to change a large percentage of the Craftsmen to require 2 or more different Resources for conversion into victory points.

Also, as only 4 new Craftsmen are available for purchase each day, adding 1 or 2 more Craftsmen to each daily pile would add the element of the unknown already present in the Events and Privileges decks, but lacking in the Craftsmen.

Ken Follet's novel Pillars Of The Earth described how simple design flaws can bring down an otherwise lovely cathedral and this game suffers the same fate. Just a little more testing could have made for a truly magnificent game.

Pillars of the Earth is the quintessential worker placement game.  Every round people first take turns selecting resources and workers.  Immediately after this people take turns placing their action pawns on the actions they would like to do this turn, they have three pawns each.  

The tricky part is that turn order at this point is decided upon pulling the pawns out of a bag.  In the early part of the round if a pawn of yours is pulled you have to decide to place it for 7 gold, or pass for later.  Next will decide to place for 6, next is 5, and so on.

Players acquire points by converting goods, money, or combination of the two, into points.

This game is a joy to play and, having read the book, I appreciate all of the subtle attachments they pull from the book.  Can't wait to play again!

Really good game. Lots of decisions to make and seems to play well with 2 through 4 players, though the game changes with the amount of players.

The concept of acquiring building resources but not converting them to buildings just strikes me as weird. In this era of board gaming, the game's supply chaining seems underdeveloped. On the plus side, the craftsman concept is cool, as are all the elements of chance in the game.

RATING: N/A
It's an abstract euro with double worker placement about getting cubes and trasnforming thenm into victory points. You really don't believe you're building a cathedral. In fact, the wooden cathedral pieces, the most beautiful components, are only used to mark the current turn. What a waste!! But the art of the game is gorgeous. The board is Michael Mentzel's at his best! 

The game is very well designed. All their mechanisms and elements interact like a perfect clockwork. Everything has been thought in order to create a good game.

Maybe it's a bit too simple for a 90-120 minutes game. You have tough decisions, that's true, but there's very little strategic and tactic content. And maybe it lacks some peculiar thing... A "soul", some would say. Maybe I'm not being totally fair, because it's a 2006 game, but nowadays there are games that do the same in less time.

Another think I didn't like is the big ammount of different card types and subtypes. The bureocracy is not very excessive, but it definitly lacks a bit of elegance in that sense.

It might not be a favourite, but it's still an excelent game I look forward to play again.

RATING: 7
(I own a Finnish edition: "Taivaan pilarit")
I liked the game. It feels meaty enough and I liked the way there is randomness in setup of each round. Just enough to keep game fresh. Game falls pretty nicely between harmless familygames and more hardcore ones. It isn't very good with two players but good with 3 and 4 players with 3 probably being the sweet spot.

Update: The game feels a bit too scripted because same workers always come in same rounds. I also don't like how it is big advantage if you remember what kind of workers there are yet to come.

Update: After playing Stone Age I less and less like the scripted nature of the worker cards.

Update : If you ever want to play this, check out how player turns go in expansion. That is way you should play original too, reduces plenty of luck of draw from game.

[2 games]The german text is the only reason that prevents me from buying it in Essen (though the text is easy to grasp). Very very very nice first impressions. The only regret: the cathedral in the middle of the board is only used to count turns, it could have been more integrated in the game (spending specific ressources to gain more points depending of the part...). I like the way the randomness is dealt, though luck is stronger in 4 player game than with less players. Now I wait to see the replayability: if good, the rating will raise. And crossing fingers for a french version!
[EDIT] More games and I feel like there is way too many manipulations for such a game, and a relative complexity on some mechanisms (the unnatural way to place workers to collect ressources you get later on turn, because of 2 events affecting collecting). Could have been implemented in a simpler way to be really a hit for me. OK game though, just not great. In less than 4 players, you loose a lot in tension (but then you have less luck of draw), too much tension in my opinion.
Replay value is low.

Wow, what a beautiful board - great artwork and setting. The game play while initially good fun, has a bit too much "efficient planning" and "card knowledge", which leads to players playing the system rather than each other.

RATING: 7.6
Gioco lineare, semplice, elegante e soddisfacente, a mio avviso il miglior gioco tratto da un libro. Si tratta di un tipico piazzamento lavoratori. Raccogliere risorse, assoldare artigiani, sfruttare i poteri dei personaggi e commerciare sono le principali azioni ben amalgamate. Gioco fluido che rende il meglio in 4, diventa strettissimo. Consiglio di aggiungere l'espansione non solo per i due giocatori ma proprio per una idea di completezza.

RATING: 6
Interesting...certainly something of Caylus in this, but it's a lot easier to co-ordinate your resources accurately, and - as if to compensate - a game much more open to close tactical play. Great component quality and artwork bely a swift game with plenty to be grasped in the initial couple of plays. The luck quotient is significant, but not as over-riding as you might be led to believe. A big letdown for me is the fact that the Master Builder locations are vastly unbalanced, and you really do need four players to get the most out of that phase of the game.

Further Thoughts: While this is a very fine game in many ways, there just doesn't seem to be the variety or the decision-making involved in many other worker-placement games. It's tighter, sure, but more fun? Really?

one of the best strategy game I've ever played. Very good balancing. You can get victory points in a variety of ways. At the end there was always a neck-and-neck race in the scoring.

With the Expansion you can play this game with up to 6 players and you have a lot of more tactical opportunities for decisions.

Felt it was a little longer than it needed to be, but it probably dragged because of all the new players.  I cannot see the game being shorter than 6 turns, so maybe it just needs the speedup gained from familiarity.  Boils down to just acquiring and trading resources.  The turn selection is clever enough, and gives the game a reason to track a currency.  Not sure I like it more than similar games like vasco da gama.

RATING: 6
In my first game, the luck of the draw absolutely crueled me, never getting a shot at the craftsmen before they were gone, nor at becoming start player. Getting good craftsmen in the latter half of the game seems essential - they double or triple your point scoring conversion rate. I consequently got mowed down and trampled, leaving a very sour taste in the mouth over the luck involved in settling a 90 minute game. The art was great, good mechanics, probably a fun and worthwhile game normally (hence my rating putting aside my personal experience somewhat as unusual). And I know how unlikely my situation was ... but I feel scarred and frustrated by the whole experience and the fear of it happening again. I'm unlikely to return.

With all the things to think about it is surprising how smoothly this game plays once you get past the first round or two.

If you like the same games as me, you're very likely to enjoy this one. It also plays great at two and in under 75 minutes.

While a good game, this definitely becomes trite after a while.  While it's fun trying to manage your craftsman to get maximum efficiency, the conversion of goods to victory points happens in the least imaginative way possible.  The reverse auction for placement order is clever, but the bag draw makes it fairly random.  There's really nothing to complain about in this game, but there's nothing to really hook you, either.

A worker placement game, very similar to [b][thing=34635][/thing][/b], but with serious differences. Comparing it to [thing=34635][/thing]:
1) This game has a more significant "luck" factor, for me. Sure, [thing=34635][/thing] has dice rolling, but the dice rollings get evenly distributed one way or another. This game depends a lot on which master builder gets drawn first; and there's nothing you can to about it!
2) Much more fiddy. There is a lot of housekeeping to do between rounds, flip cards, replenish market... [thing=34635][/thing] plays much more straightforwardly.
3) Pillars has a much more straightforward scoring. [thing=34635][/thing] gives you different paths to victory and, thus, more options.

Last and most important: I cannot enjoy Pillars of the Earth as much as [thing=34635][/thing], which is a very fun game. I give Pillars its fair share of credit, it has very nice mechanisms, great components and outstanding outwork, but as long as [thing=34635][/thing] exists, the latter will supersede this game.

A few more years and a few more plays. The game seems to have settled itself now for me. After the first initial impression I have a bit of a letdown. Now I appriciate it more again. The 8 stands

***

A fine game with beautiful artwork and a great theme. The first couple of plays, Pillars game was the perfect ten. It was elegant, full of theme and threw in a big chunk of luck that, in my opinion, spiced up the game-experience.  

But after some more plays I begun to see the weakness: replayability is only mediocre to poor. At the beginning there seemed to be so much to explore, but soon enough it felt like Pillars was playing it self. After some 15 plays it felt more like a normal 7 than the perfect 10. Still a fine game, but not exceptional by any standards.

I inconsequently rate it somewhat in-between my first and latest impressions. I did really love the first five or six plays, and that's got to be counted for something.

Currently, this is one of my favorite worker placement games.  It's fairly tight, not completely predictable, and fairly smooth play.  I will rarely turn down a game.

My minor issue is that there are fiddlely rules if/when you replace one of your starting workers, with losing an ability.  I understand the desire to have players keep (or upgrade, not replace) their starters, however it's a little clunky.  This is a very minor nit and won't really affect game play.

A nice light/midweight worker placement game.  My brother in law got this for me as an xmas gift, and I had gotten him Stone Age.  We played both back to back, and they were very similar in many regards (place workers to get resources and convert them into VP).  We played Stone Age first, and Pillars had our group feeling a bit bored; but I liked Pillars better.  The limited number of craftsmen you can employ leads to a tight economy.  Beautiful components help the theme shine.

This was originally a bit of an impulse buy at a cheap price.  Subsequently, we really like the game.  Firstly, the artwork is lovely and very detailed.

The game rules take awhile to go through, as does the set-up, but a new player picks up the game play quickly.

I like the worker management aspect of the game and that you can choose different tactics in your gameplay.  Plus, I like the artwork on the game board.  This gets a fair amount of table time.

I can see one's approach becoming more calculating with further play, as you get used to the card progression and begin counting on certain things to appear at certain times, though, so I'll hold off on banishing it to the Stack of Okay Games.

Having won a game of it now, I can the critical tension of playing to your strengths, the risky and expensive assignment of the Master Builders, and the balance of hosing vs. point-generating.  Better than I thought.

I don't like the base game where you always have the same 4 craftsmen in every round. I think the frustration can be too big as you can go for converting metal, but be unlucky when the master builders are drawn. 

I like it a lot more with the extra craftsmen from one of the expanions, as then you don't know what will come, so you (and the rest) have to play more opportunistic.

With just one play, I have to give it a 7 (sorry - that's so boring).  A night intermediary between, say, Caylus and Stone Age.  Some random factors help keep it so.  I'm sure there's an art to cranking up the VP engine, but there's a chance that some of the game oversells itself.  It strikes me that of the 14 spots you can go for on the board, some are of obvious use to you (but you often can't get them), while others you take clearly because you don't know what else to do.  But this may not be fair.  We'll play some more and think about it.
Rose to 8 after a few plays.  Good times, and the theme helps me connect to it a lot.
and back to 7.  too many lame things for workers to do; too much luck in the draw of master builders.
interested to try the sequel.

Simple worker placement game. It has pretty straightforward mechanics and production value is a great game. The board is very well designed, and you just need to follow the board to know how to work out the core phase of the game. It does a good job of balancing the score. Having said all that, I did find the challenge on this game to be not on par with what I want, because there is no surprise on how the points will go. This would be the game I would play when I want a close point system and not a lot of really harsh decisions to be made, which makes it ideal for situations where you have non-gamers or people that are not that don't handle well large score differentials.

Very, very nice to look at.  However, it often felt like I was getting played by the game.  There are only so many ways to get victory points, and you can almost work it out to a threshold of how much gold you are willing to spend per victory point.  If you are able to stick to your chosen ratio, and it's lower than everyone elses, you'll win.  There's an interesting mechanism of putting master builders out as they are drawn from the bag, but this can't really shut you down too extremely bad.  The event cards may be a little too random compared to the rest of the game.  I like how you need to be prepared for events, but with how open and obvious the rest of the game is, the complete and sometimes gamebreaking events can lead to some times where you just have to throw your hands up and take it like a man (or woman).  Note, I won the game I played, just didn't care too much for it as a repeat performance.

Enjoyable and quite beautiful card-drafting and worker-placement game. The usual: compete for resources, combine and convert into victory points.

Better games in this genre exist. There's not much that keeps me coming back to this one, and it does have one or two things I don't like about it. Mainly, it's all about efficiency, but the order is which players place workers is random. So you can spend the time calculating what space is the most valuable for you, but it's quite possible that all the other players can place two or all three workers before you can place your first one. So much luck has no place in an efficiency-game like this. Second, it is quite long, which combined with the luck factor can be frustrating.

If you don't mind the randomness, though, this is an interesting game with nice interlocking elements.

Worker placement seems to be hit or miss for me, where the misses are the games that a) give you too much options to calculate your own most efficient path without much need to figure out what the other players need, and b) throw in randomness without much purpose. Like Stone Age, Pillars misses more than it hits.

RATING: 5
Despite having a stronger sense of theme than Caylus (due to artwork and mechanics), this is a still another accounting chore to efficiently "run your engine" to convert resources into victory points, via actions gained from meeple placement. However, because of the chaos of events and master builders drawn from the bag this is more fun and tense than its serious older brother. But in the end it is too detailed and textual to be enjoyable.

Fun, rich in theme (for a Euro), great art. A little too easy to "solve" but good for a "next step" game. I want to play it a lot now since I just got it but expect to give it no more than 10 plays. Definitely prefer Caylus. Only played with 2 and 3 but Master Builder draws and craftsman appearance (along with many other card draws) add a significant element of luck, especially with more players. Worried many choices are false choices as some craftsmen and MB spots are better than others (2 workers for 1 round seems lame). However, this does add to the value of the "First Turn" MB spot.

Much more interesting after having read the book - a nice implementation.  Lighter and quicker than Caylus.  Economics similar to St. Petersburg.  Satisfying to play but not much of a rush to win.

RATING: 6
A milder Caylus or Age of Empire III. The game plays in about an hour (which is about as long as it should - anything longer requires some combat). Though it lacks the depth and complexity of either Caylus or AoE3, it is do-able for most gamers and that is a big plus. Some have complained of the randomness in a few aspects of the game - this too is a plus as it is far less predictable than either of the two afore-mentioned games. While those are 'serious' games; Pillars borrows the good parts and adds a dose of fun.

RATING: 6
It's a nice game, fun to play........but it seems like turns 1 thru 5 are irrelevant.  It always seems like everyone is all bunched up close together in VP's going into the last turn.  And the whole thing revolves around grabbing craftsman who crank out tons of VP's that last turn as to if you can win or not.  If you don't get one of those craftsman, or the resources they need to produce, you loose.  Even if you're in last place going into the last turn, what you do in that one turn can easily make you the winner.

Have played the expansion.

One 3- and two 4-player games. This is a making 'lemonade from lemons' game.

Cathedral production resources would be much better used to give pieces for a 5th player. I hope to play this again soon.

I like how the board is the sequence of play for the turn. The two mechanisms for select actions. One you control as you assign your 10 role points to various actions. The other is more random, where the earlier draws have to pay for that privilege.

This is a better work placement games, much superior to LeHarve and Agricola.

This was a fun game to play and fairly easy to learn from the get go. It just took a couple of rounds to see strategies better. Knowing the cards before you start is almost a necessity for the game. 

I feel that on one hand some of the game mechanics do share similarities with Caylus and can see why its nicknamed "Caylus-light", but the way the game plays is definately different.

As is discussed on this thread: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/159361 , more variety is needed within the workers, like is done with the event cards. I would probably enjoy the game more if something like this was available.

From one side, it's hard to not compare this game to Caylus. In either game you are working on a common project, you have to send your workers to different locations... On the other hand this game is more lighter and more family-friendly. More luck is involved... The components and board are much prettier... I like the "draw the master-builders from the bag" element of the game. But I like Caylus more! In spite of this, this is a good game, and looking forward playing it again.

After figuring out how much I liked the worker placement genre after playing a game of Lords of Waterdeep, I knew that this was a must have after receiving so many props from the Dice Tower reviewers. This is one of the most thematic and enjoyable games I have ever played. The game board is by far the best looking one in my game collection and the box art itself is also one of the best in my collection. I added custom labels to my wooden church pieces that makes the game feel even more thematic! A game of this tends to run a bit long (at least with my game group) which is the only reason I didn't rate it a 10.

I would now have to agree that Pillars does not quite reach the level of gameplay that other games permit. The one good thing that it has going for it is that it is very simple and easy to explain and play. That same thing makes it a game that leaves you wanting for more complexities after a few games. Not to say that it is now enjoyable, but that it is more of a family game or a game to play with non-gamers, perhaps. I decrease my rating from 9 to 7.8.

About average for a worker placement game. A lot of cards, so it's impossible to tell what will be available in each game. And though the mechanism to determine how the master builders will be placed is clever, it is a little random for my tastes - especially in later rounds.

Glad I finally got to play this, but this does not even come close to Agricola or Stone Age for me - guess I'm still looking for that light worker placement game that I like.

The expansion is pretty much mandatory addition. I'm going to try the Expansion Strip rules because it seems to balance the Master Builder phase quite a bit.

Based on one play.  It may be better if it moves quickly--I think our game took 2 hours, and that was much too much for a game this light.  I harbor no ill will towards the game--it seems to be perfectly fine, and I don't find myself hating any particular part of it.  But on the other hand, I find nothing memorable about having played.  I'm having a hard time thinking of anything to say, good or bad, about the game.  A strange sign....

A very nicely implemented worker placement game. The worker cards remind me a bit of factories in Power Grid, where you are converting goods to points and upgrading them to more efficient models throughout the game. Smartly and beautifully designed board, everything has a place, is logical to follow and understand. The master builder phase adds a nice level of randomness to the game, and the costs involved to balance out that randomness feel natural.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First play revealed a close score at the end despite each of the players taking different paths to get their.  We were handicapped as we did not know all the craftsmen that would show up during the game, but expect that with practice, one will start to anticipate (or strive for) key cards as part of an overall strategy.  First play was with 3 - so competition for the master builders and goods not as tight.  Suspect that game shines best with 4.  But a good resource optimization game that can be played in a reasonable length of time.

Reports suggest that it's a "Caylus-lite" or somesuch. To assess that, I first have to try Caylus, and then try this one. Seems awfully fiddly, and there are tons of different rules.

There are some reports that the game is "broken". This is worth looking into. Meaningful comment: "the luck component seems poorly allocated". Big swings in all the unsatisfying places.

I won't be buying this. I own Stone Age and it's a similar theme.

This oldie had been on my Want to Play list for a long time.  Finally got to play it and it fell pretty flat.  It is Min/Max the Euro.  It's often compared to Stone Age, but in some ways it feels more like Power Grid.  Similar to Power Grid with improving power plants, you are building a hand of 5 cards that increase over the game in how efficiently they convert resources into points, but without the tension of Power Grid of only having 3 slots and having to auction them.  Your spending workers (kind of like a reusable $12) to get cards that give you cubes, and each round will vary in their availability, but the amount of resources you get per worker doesn't change over time like the market dynamics in Power Grid.  Different than Power Grid, much of the game centers around worker placement with this interesting dynamic that the order that you get to place your 3 workers depends on when they get pulled from a bag, with earlier pulled workers having a greater cost if you want to place them early or wait until all the workers have been pulled.  It's interesting, but because of this uncertainty the game lacks a lot of the tension in other worker placement games where you try to predict where each player will place their first worker and whether you can wait a round or need to go now, etc.  There's a 1st player spot, but that only matters for buying cards at the beginning and has not affect on the worker placement sequence.  This game just feels really dated and doesn't hold up to other worker placement games or even its heavier predecessor Caylus, which I think is still great.

An excellent game.  Wonderful components and a beautiful board.  A lot of mechanics being played at once, but the game is easy to manage and learn and does not get overly complicated.  Plays quick with great strategy.  

Strategy - Use the early rounds to collect goods, especially metal, and money.  Pick up privilege cards that will help you the entire game and as many victory points in the Priory as possible.  Use the later rounds to score as many points as possible with the glassblower/bell maker and larger conversion workers.  Save as much gold as possible and use the Goldsmith in the last round for big points.

--Jan2011-- Nice constrained-placement game, with apparently thematic gestures.  (I say "apparently" because I've not read the book, so they're all lost on me.)

For having only played Agricola and Stone Age as far as worker placement games go, I definitely prefer this game to Stone Age. There is a bit of randomness based on the cards drawn and the order of play, but there are enough viable strategies to work with that this game just works. I'm sure there are better worker placement games out there (some say Puerto Rico or Caylus- I wouldn't know), but I do enjoy this one.

This is by far the most beautiful game I have.  The game board is amazing with the amount of detail.  The cards have incredible art work as well.  And the rest of the pieces, the workers and what not, are top quality as well.  Again, this game looks increble.

But looks aren't all this game has - it is also fun.  There are so many choices to be made, it's possible to try different strategies.  What resources and crafstmen should I go for, etc.  

My one complaint is that I can't play this with my normal 5 player board game group.  But still, this game is fun, and easily playable in 90 minutes (as long as players do not take too long making decisions).

This is my favourite "traditional board game" that I've played so far.
I love the breadth and depth of choices each player makes during all steps of the game. There is almost no down time for players as everybody is interested in the action at all times. Every choice is a difficult one with so many options of where to play your master builders or what to buy with your workers.
All this combined with a lovely theme from an entertaining books makes for a masterful game.
I highly recommend the expansion which fixes some issues with worker placement and makes the game fun with all the way up to 6 players.

RATING: 7.5
Played a two player game. Final score is 54-53. It is very well balance for 2 player. I think it is mainly because each player gets to put 3 master builders on the board in phase 2 and I can see this change when it is a 3 or 4 player game. In 3 or 4 player game, there is a chance you will put different number of master builder on the among players. I have mix feeling after my first play. I find the first few rounds of the game to be quite boring. I was doing nothing much other than keeping myself balanced, meaning not over spent and score enough points. However, the last two rounds are so satisfying because the much better craftsman cards become available. I scored big in my last round and won. However, I won't call this engine building though. In our game, we went with total different strategy. I was trying to keep myself balanced, my opponent was trying to score as many points as possible each round. I fell behind quite a bit going to the final round and I totally caught up because i had been collecting metal combine with extra income per metal after each round. However, my opponent almost won if he had not made one mistake in the final round. 

So I don't know. You can win without planning way ahead of time and there is really no need to build your "engine". There is also some luck element in the game when it gets to 3 or 4 player game. I find the game starting pretty slow. It turns out to be quite exciting in the final two rounds. I think the game is best with 3. Will play more and try the expansion.

I thought it'd be something much more better. I mean more strategy game. I can see fun, but for me it's kind of boring. Not too many strategies to choose. I can't even build anything. 

Of course it was worth to play just for the sake of its mechanics when placing builders. Player who started this round takes randomly from the black sack one builder. It can be his color or someone else. Then he puts it on a free (7th space) of a something like a clock... This player can pay seven and place his builder somewhere on the board, or just pass. I think I'd play it again just for that part of the game... ;)

Somehow I prefer other worker placement games to this one. Some of the possible options seem to be no-brainer, whereas some other options seem to be clearly inferior. With two players and the original rules, some options will never get chosen. With the revised two-player rules it is better, but still the game is probably only interesting with 3 or 4 players. (adi)

The master builder mechanics of this game are both my favorite and least favorite part.  Drawing them out of a bag ads some interest to the game, but have a batch of bad luck and you get nothing you want.  However, I managed to win even being the last pawns drawn every time.  So I can't say it's a flaw, just a frustration.

Good worker-placement and beautiful gameboard. Unfortunately the workers get too strong in the final rounds. Another point: being the starting player is an advantage ... if you want, you can stay the starting player the whole game.
There are better worker-placement-games.

EDIT: Traded off against "Leaque of Six".

EDIT 2: Back again in my collection since "German Math Trade August '14" (together with "Onirim" for my unplayed copy of "Tinners' Trail")

EDIT 3: And traded again ... this time for "Inca Empire" + "Bonus cards" at Essen no-shipping MT 2014.

EDIT 4: I believe this is the last time this game enters my collection. Reason: the chance to get it together with the rare big expansion and the "New Craftsmen" promo cards. So now there has to be a contest evening with "The Pillars of the Earth" (+ expansions) as the first dish followed by "World without End".

RATING: 6
Yes, it does remind me of Caylus, but there's random elements that change each game through card distribution - something you really only get in Caylus through player interaction. The rules are very easy to follow and it can play in about 90 minutes with four experienced players. There's not quite enough resource competition in the two player game for my liking, but it's not too bad. Being start player in the last round is a must in a four player game - too much of a lucky advantage in this and who gets to place their master builder first in the final two rounds kind of spoils an otherwise entertaining game. 24 points each for two of the players (more than one third of their scores), and about half that for the other two players (because they weren't the start player or drawn early out of the bag ), is what you can expect out of this game. This distribution system verges on the annoying, certainly on the frustrating.

When I knew about this game and after reading the rules I didn't have much expectations about it and I decided to pass on it.  Nevertheless, I found it in a store at a very good price and I had to buy it.  Good for me, cause I had a pleasant surprise when I played it.  Very nice worker placement game, great components, beautiful art, full of theme, easy rules, deep enough gameplay and some tough decisions.  The game is about getting resources to give them to your construction crew in order to get points out of your contributions on building the Kingsburg Cathedral.  The player that contributes the most wins the game.  Playing after reading the novel is wonderful, cause you know a little more about the characters and events.  The game can be used as a gateway.

I like the pseudo-random worker placement mechanic a lot.  It's just a shame that the resource gathering system is so weird, although I completely understand the development decisions that will have led to it.
It also has a massively bad case of Power Grid syndrome in that there is a core part of the system that, no matter how often you play, you will never remember and yet if you get it wrong the game will likely prove a bit fragile.

Mechanically, this is an interesting take on worker placement. It's mechanically solid, but I didn't find it as engaging as I was hoping for. I didn't like the implementation of the thematic elements that much. It felt extremely dry, and it felt like it was too much about directly getting resources to turn into victory points. There are plenty of games that do resource conversion into victory points without feeling so lifeless, but for whatever reason I just didn't like the way it was done in Pillars of the Earth.

Only a few plays but am completely enamored with it.

Lots of classic Euro mechanics blended seamlessly with BEAUTIFUL presentation and great bits.  It's also not too brain-burny and it all flows so nicely.  Fairly straight forward and simple enough once you've played a turn it'll fall into place.  I'd probably call it a great 2nd-tier gateway to heavier games.  Enough luck, I love the pawn-pulling from the bag.  Very exciting.

Also does a great representation of the book, as far as a game imitating a book can go I reckon which just adds to the coolness.

I have been looking to play this game since BGG.con last November, and I FINALLY was able to today. I was skeptical because though it looked interesting when I saw it, people I've talked to gave it really lackluster reviews. I'm happy to say that they were all full of crap - I like the game very much!

RATING: 4
Probably a good game for its time, but it has been surpassed. Stone Age is more elegant, and AoEIII more satisfying. The randomness of the Master Builder phase drives me absolutely nuts (especially since mine are always drawn after every spot I want has been taken). The game heavily rewards experience and knowing the cards. The game is also not very well-balanced, particularly with the gold-producing Carpenter (and especially in 2er games). The game often comes down to a crap-shoot in the last round of who is the start player, and whose Master Builder gets pulled out of the bag first.

Like it with 3. 4 players is way too crowded for the board (you're forced to take god-awful actions with your last worker), and 4 only makes the Master Builder phase even more random. It is playable with 4 if you use the placement rule from the expansion. 2 is unplayable without the expansion, due to the predictability of the cards, and the small but significant advantage the player who obtains the gold-producing Carpenter enjoys.

This game is made excellent with the expansion set.

Worker placement and resource management.  Yummy.  Random cards and events keep the game fresh and fun and there is some blocking involved as well - especially if only one of a particular resource card comes out for purchase.  In only one of my plays, was there a feeling like I was out of the game, and that's something I like.  This one is available for play on Brettspielwelt, where it is very fun.  I like Pillars of Earth very much, but it sometimes feels to me like it is missing something.  I can't put my finger on it.  I think it could be that sometimes the last round is anti-climactic as you can sometimes know who is going to win.  Despite the fact that it's an enjoyable game, I have a feeling that I will enjoy World Without End even more if I get around to playing it.  Could it be because it feels like there are tougher choices?  Perhaps.

Caylus may be the standard game with the worker placement mechanism, but it's way too fiddly and long.

This game doesn't exactly replace Caylus' mechanics, but it fits in the same genre and it's better. A number of mechanics work together well, things are tight, but not TOO tight, and competitive but not TOO competitive. And there's always more available than what you are able to do.

However, the master worker draw is ultimately flawed, and turns the game from excellent to flawed. Too much luck in too small a space.

[3 plays] Although there is nothing here that makes me say, "Wow, I've never seen anything like that before!", I am always still grinning and enjoying the tension building as the game progresses. This is a very well produced and a very solid game. I am impressed and look forward to many more games of Pillars.

PotE is a resource and worker placement game that seems like a cross between AoEIII and Stone Age, despite being published well before either of them. Knowledge of the novel is not critical, but the theme is fun. Each player is trying to contribute victory points toward the building of the cathedral while competing for limited resources and craftsmen. It has an economic engine buildup, which I often enjoy.

Most recent play 3-13-10 at Cabin Con 2010.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Typical Euro worker placement where you balance resources, money, and victory points. This is usually my cup of tea, but Pillars just falls flat for me. Nothing new or special going on here. 

This game is based on an excellent book though- you should check it out!

Acquired: August 2011 - GenCon

RATING: 7
The game borrows from Caylus and it shows even down to the theme: getting resources to build a cathedral. Each turn, players use their builders and/or money to draft cards. These are then later exchanged for resources. Their master builders are then placed on a variety of different spots around the city, each with a different ability (exemption from tax, acquire event cards, marketplace to buy/sell goods). The ultimate goal being to process cubes or money through a variety of craftsmen in exchange for VPs.

Rinse and repeat for 6 rounds and determine winner. This means that some action rounds are rather processional and there wasn't a real sense of decision. Some clever intertwined mechanics works well together. The game has some meat on its bones and feels less forced than Caylus. This falls just outside the middleweight category but isn't a the heavyweight either! I think that's a flaw against it. All up, a good solid game but nothing new here.

Neck and neck with "Stone Age". The latter looks more "gateway-friendly" with brighter graphics, dice and simplified actions but POTH is just about as easy to play yet involves a little more strategy. It also introduces events, taxes and workers that can impact a player's strategy mid-game. Can't go wrong with either game, go with the former if you like a heavier dose of strategy, go with the latter if you like a little more luck and a cleaner/brighter board.

Resource Management, Economic. Very favorable impression after first session (4p). Intimidating number of moving parts on initial read-through of the rules, but it's really not that complicated and play moves smoothly after the first turn or two. Looking forward to more plays.

Update: dropped my rating a bit now that I've played Stone Age. Stone Age feels very much like Pillars to me, but less dry and with more avenues to outscore your opponents. It does use dice, however, so if you prefer a more deterministic game then Pillars may suit you better.

Good game.  I recently tried a metal-heavy strategy, and it's is not a great way to play.  Saving more than 2 metals for the last round is probably a waste of time... there are too few things to be made with metal, and you can only do them once or twice per round.

Még tavaly, több mint egy éve meghallgattam a szabályát, de végül nem futottam neki a játéknak, mert kicsit nehéznek éreztem az akkori társastudásomhoz. Most lassan 250 különböző játék ismerete után sem mondom könnyűnek a játékot. Nagyon sok mindenre kell figyelni ebben a munkáslehelyezős játékban, de cserében egy komoly, jó játékot kapunk kellemes játékélménnyel. A játékosok egy katedrálist építenek. 12 munkásukkal 3 fajta nyersanyagot szereznek, amit építőmestereik segítségével a piacon eladhatnak vagy mesterembereik segítségével győzelmi pontra váltanak. Ezen túl van még egy speciális nyersanyag, amit csak építőmesterrel lehet szerezni, illetve több hely különböző előnyök megszerzéséhez. A játékot nem játszani nehéz, hanem jól játszani nem könnyű. Sok helyre kell figyelni, a munkásokat, építőmestereket jól, megfelelő helyre lehelyezni, közben figyelni a mesterembereinkre is, akikre még különböző szabályok is vonatkoznak. A játék tartalmaz némi szöveget is kártyákon, ezért némi nyelvtudás sem árt hozzá, bár a fordítással tökéletesen játszható a játék. Az építőmesterek lehelyezési mechanizmusát először túl nagy szerencseszerepnek éreztem a játékban, de rájöttem jól kitalált dologról van szó. Így végülis nehéz bármilyen negatív dolgot mondanom. Sokan a Stone Age-hez hasonlítják, de annál jóval komolyabb darab és szerintem tökéletesen megfér egy gyűjteményben mindkét játék, mert a Stone Age könnyedebbsége több társaságban eladhatóvá teszi a szóban forgó játékhoz képest.

[2014-10-26]
Nagyon jókor sikerült három év után újrajátszanom, ugyanis előtte játszottam a Lewis & Clarkkal, aminél azt éreztem kevesebb több lett volna, a Pillars esetében viszont minden klappol. Ma már úgy látom egyáltalán nem nehéz a játék. Pár fontos helyszín van a játékban, amire figyelni kell. Összehasonlítva nekem jobban tetszik, mint a Lewis, valahogy jobban eltalált a bonyolultsága.

Really like all the mechanisms in this game, particularly pulling the master builders from the bag. The game has quite a few tense moments and some hair pulling decisions. Its theme is a bit light but it does fit with the fact that you are literally trying to turn resources into victory points as efficiently as possible. I'm also a big fan of the art and components in this game. Definitely one of my favorite Euros.

Good game. A little more luck than in Caylus. Being first player is a big advantage. Seating order also plays a large role. This has been a hit with everyone I've introduced it to so far. One complaint is with the replayability. This is one game that is begging for an expansion with more craftsmen, events, advantages, etc.
Update: Added .5 to the score now that I've played the expansion.  It adds a great deal to the game and increases the replayability by a huge factor.

Drafting, drafting, drafting. Drafting, drafting, drafting. Drafting, drafting, drafting. Drafting, drafting, drafting.

If you like drafting this one's got it.  Drafting for me really hits and misses, but with PotE the card draws are timed so that they are totally random.  It pacing of the deck is finely balanced, so it works for me.  What is totally screwy is the draws for the turn order.  In some regards I like this particular part of the system, but bad luck on the draw can really hump someone hard.  Right where you wipe.  It isn't far fetched to say that the draws can cause a winning player to lose the game.  I guess it could be worse, it could be all auctions.

What I don't like is that it requires players to have a front loaded understanding of the values of cards.  On first play, I don't think it is clear to players that some cards are just better than others. Many of the same card faces just upgrade in value at the same price. I am a little concerned about the Monk that gives you a bonus to all VPs in the Monastery, it seems a little screwy. Because of the way it is timed, early cards are worth less, so the game escalates. This is fine, as it forces you to mix it up and continue to build yourself up, but the large return at the end of the game makes the first couple turns useless, it's not like you had to do anything at the beginning to get anything at the end, you just have to Keep Up with the Joneses.  This system may also turn off a newbie when they spend too much for a quickly outdated card.   I appreciate how tight the game is, as it is a neck and neck race right to the bitter end.  Money is tight and resources are tighter.  I like the penalties from firing the low men on the totem pole and all the decisions that come with it.  All in all a fine enough well crafted Euro for those that want that sort of thing.  

I don't think I'd turn down a game, but frankly it is just so close to Caylus in so many ways that it is clear to see how it is an inferior product for what I want out of a game. I'd probably rather play Caylus or Leonardo DaVinci, but Pillars is shorter and more accessible, so this fulfills a purpose.  I could play this with people that aren't used to really heavy Euros (or for those that like indirect passive aggression rather than direct conflict in games) and still get a kick out of it.

This game is a winner and current leader of the pack for best of 2007. Its a typical Euro with resource management and role selection being the main mechanics. But it mashes in some other elements as well. There is a wonderful catch up mechanism for cash (workers in the mill), the economics of whether to spend for placement or wait for free actions, building upon a set strategy and activating resources a la Power Grid. The boards is gorgeous to look at and the round marker (building an actual wooden cathedral) is unique and thoughtful. Overall, the game oozes theme, is easy to teach and plays in about 2 hours.

It's a resource game - you collect cubes, then trade them in for VP (or money). Like Caylus but shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. Maybe a little too much randomness for me (the order the cards come up and the order the builder tokens are pulled from the bag). Also, there's not enough choice of what to do, especially in a 4-player game: even with only 3 workers eah, those last few workers often have nowhere interesting to go -- and they were drawn in random order!

5.5/10 for the game with original rules. However, it's easy to incorporate the expansion rule to bump it back to a 6/10: set aside 1 master builder per player. When a player places a master builder on the board for the first time, place the set-aside meeple of their color in a line. After players have placed their 2 meeples from the bag onto action spaces, in reverse order (last in first out) these third meeples get placed onto action spaces.

It's a resource game - you collect cubes, then trade them in for VP (or money). In some ways it's like Caylus but shorter, simpler, and less repetitive version. 

I'm not actually sure how I feel about it. It plays pretty quickly, and it was fun ... but I almost feel like I have a greater appreciation for Caylus (and I'm not one of those Caylus fanboys)! There just seemed to be a bit too much randomness here (the way the cards come up and the order the builder tokens are pulled from the bag), and not enough choice of what to do (only 3 workers, drawn in random order).

10/3: the builder-pull is just too annoyingly random/frustrating ... dropping rating 0.5 to 5.5 for the game with original rules. However, it's easy to incorporate the expansion rule to make it a bit better: set aside 1 master builder per player. When a player places a master builder on the board for the first time, place the set aside meeple in line directly in front of the last meeple in that line. After all players have placed their 2 drawn meeples on the board, they place their third meeple as well -- according to the order of the line (reverse the order they were placed there).

Really hate the fact Ken Follett's name gets the marquee, and the designers get barely any mention.  There's also something about the look and feel of the game that turns me off.  Never been inclined to try it as a consequence, despite a lot of people liking it.

Edit: 12/14/09  Played a few weeks ago.  I was reluctant, and while I enjoyed it well enough it didn't knock my socks off. "Caylus light" is a pretty apt description, and since Caylus took me a long time to warm up to even a little bit, no surprise this wasn't rocking my world from the start.

I was more than a bit annoyed by the contrived, "gamey" nature of how the market works.

Still, it's not a bad game, just not one I'd be rushing to the table.  Lots of other light-ish games I prefer.

RATING: 7
I think Caylus light is an apt description.  After one play, I think you need to have some money in reserve in order to take advantage of golden opportunities, especially in the later rounds when some good cards appear.  Update:  still enjoyable, but lacking a certain something for such a longish game.  Perhaps there's a bit too much luck for a game this long and not enough player interaction, making it feel a bit too dry and calculating.

RATING: 7
Playing this game for the first time 8 years after it was released is probably a bit unfair to it since every other game that comes out nowadays is worker placement and everyone's trying to come up with something different to make their worker placement game the diamond in the rough.  And as a HUGE worker placement game fan AND critic I've played a lot of them and have seen some diamonds but also a lot of rough.

This is a fine game, it's well designed, has interesting decisions, and also teaches and plays easily and quickly.  But it is just kind of bland next to all the worker placement stuff available nowadays.

Each turn players start by either buying craftsman or supplies of resources.  Then when that phase is finished the starting player draws the players pawns randomly from a bag one at a time.  When a player's piece is drawn he can decide to pay the current amount to place his pawn or place it for free after all other pawns have been placed.  This is my favorite part of the game because it is a somewhat interesting and well designed approach to worker placement.  The first seven pawns placed in a turn (each player has 3) cost 7-1 gold to place.  This puts a cost on selecting highly sought after spaces while also giving you the option to take the "leftovers" for free.  The starting player also still gets an advantage since he is able to once that round put a piece back and reselect.

However aside from a very small selection of special ability cards that's all that gives this game any kind of personality.  The rest of the game is very standard worker placement actions leading up to having your craftsman just turn resources into points to represent building a cathedral (there's even 6 wooden pieces of the cathedral...which I guess is a nice aesthetic touch except they are just plain wood and I don't have the time or skill to paint them).

Very blah despite being well designed.  Perhaps in 2006 it was good but it certainly doesn't hold up in 2014.

Very fine game overall.  Three things prevent me from rating it higher: (1) the luck in drawing pieces from the bag can be severe (it usually balances out, but sometimes it's brutal). (2) I wish there were extra characters for each turn, so you never know which ones would be in a given game.  (The characters have turn numbers on the back: 1, 2, etc.  All four for each turn are always available, though you don't know if you have to pay for them or can use your master builder to get them.) (3) We've noticed a "fall-behind loser" syndrome.  It's not really a runaway leader, but it has a similar effect.  That is, we've NEVER (in roughly ten games) had a game where the person in last place after turn 3 won the game.  But that may change as we learn the game more.  Otherwise, very nice time length for the type of game it is.

I like worker placement games but I don’t play a lot of them and I almost never get exited about them, That is probably why I haven’t played this until now.  This game has a little twist to it by having two separate worker placement phases.  There is a phase where you actually place workers which I found slightly humorous and a phase where you place master builders.  Both phases have massively different game effects and work with a different mechanic.  The worker placement phase is a simple clockwise around the table affair of assigning workers to the available resource cards or claiming a new artisan.  During the master builder phase each player has their three master builders placed in a bag for a random draw.  The master builders are placed on the board where each spot on the board has an effect.  These affects can be event cards, artisan cards, tax collector, etc.  The thing it the player order here is massively important as there are a couple really good spots, some ok spots and some not so good spots.  This is mitigated by the fact that when your Builder is drawn from the bag you can pass or play the builder for a cost.  The cost ranges form 7 down to 0.  The first builder drawn costs 7 and then the cost goes down by one for each builder drawn.  This has an interesting effect where you can get really good stuff or you can pass and save you bling for future turns.  

I liked it and would readliy play it again.

Another game my wife gravitated towards. Can't for sure say why that is. I think the bidding mechanism and drawing from bag is a big pull for her.

I had a very good first impression of this game and bought it immediately after I played it at Spiel 2006. But having played some more, I see some serious replayability issues. There just isn't enough variety to keep this game interesting after ten plays. If the game were very short, that wouldn't be such a problem, but Pillars will usually take 90 minutes at the minimum. It does play a lot faster with two, and since my partner has recently come to like it, I suspect I'll keep on playing it for a while.

I liked the gameplay.  The problem I had was with the master builders.  I know that paying money is supposed to mitigate the luck, but it really can affect the end of the game.  Getting a key specialty card or mason early is huge, and has nothing to do with player skill.  The other problem I has was with the endgame where there really were no options for the final people who placed master builders.  Because of dumb luck, they have no chance of getting those extra couple of points that make the difference between winning and losing.  In any game design that should be up to the players, not a bad draw or a die roll.

Amazing artwork!  The play is solid and fluid, but our first game was a bit too affected by chance--one player never had a master builder pulled on the first two draws and therefore never had to pay more than $5, plus initial turn order meant he got the 1 wood for $4 worker as well.  This was a 3 player game.  I'll post more after more plays, and likely adjust my rating--up if the randomness was overindicated in this first game, down if it seems that this randomness is too much.

This game surprised me.  Now, I normally steer well clear of the very silly and mostly imaginary Euro/Ameritrash divide, however anyone taking the time to study my game ratings would realize that the only true, Euro-style games I really enjoy are those that aren't overly complex and don't take too long.  To be fair, this is certainly not an overly complex game, per se, once you've got a game under your belt (even though it does require a fair bit of thought, advance planning, and mapping out of the multiple paths to victory).  And the theme is, well, as good as can be expected from a Euro-style game, although the game play reminds me in almost no way of the book upon which the game is based (which is a very good thing, because I think the book is HIGHLY over-rated, and VERY poorly written).  So where was I going with this mini review?  Oh yes, all that to say that I've found a fairly involved, relatively long, thinly-themed, Euro-style game that I rather enjoy.  Mind you, my only experience is with 4 players, so I don't know how well it would scale with fewer players and therefore less competition.  And I'm also curious about this "Stone Age" game that has drawn so many comparisons.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

I really enjoy this game. I find that despite the "luck" complaints, I am frequently defeated by a variety of sound strategies.  I also think that Pillars is a much tighter game than Caylus which often leaves open too many avenues and options for victory.  The disadvantage with Pillars is that it is less interactive than Caylus.

Such a perfectly balanced game, no card is quintessentially better than another, and all options are valid enough to keep you in contention.

The random mix of resources each turn followed by the random draw of pieces really does make sure no one can monopolise in one aspect and know they'll win.

Love this game, seriously need to play it more.

[Based on 3 plays] This games gets a lot of comparison to Caylus. I see the comparison but really there is a lot of differences between the two games, including overall feel and gameplay. I don't think it quite lives up to Caylus.  Two things in particular stuck out to me.  I disliked the events that might be good or bad and were hard to plan for.  I feel in Caylus the difference between just losing or just winning is a good move here or there, in Pillars of the Earth it feels like it was a random event or the order the masters get pulled from the bag that makes just enough difference for who wins or loses.  An okay game but just not as satisfying to win or lose based on an event or master builder pull.  The game has grown on me some, I will grant it is more accessible and easier to play than Caylus.  The expansion helps mitagate from the master builder pull luck as well.

RATING: 5
Played once, then sold. Disappointing. I had read the book, and looked forward to something rich in theme about cathedral building. The cathedral pieces included are just turn markers - a waste of material. You try to maximize turning cubes into points without spending too much money. When that dry formula is the basis for a game, I think it needs to add some fun through opportunities for player interaction or for building a larger strategy than just what's best to do per move. This game lacks those two elements. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's badly designed or imbalanced or too luck-based (I wasn't bothered as much as others by the master builder draw). I can see why some people would like this a lot, but it's not for me.

I found this to one of the tightest resource crunchers yet. But in a way that I didn't like so much. You cannot afford to under maximize even one choice. Every turn is so tight, every choice is so tight. Comparing this game to Caylus is unavoidable. And, I feel in Caylus there is more stuff to do with yr. cubes, there are combos to pull off. Here all you really end up doing is maximize yr. choices  and cash in the most cubes you can for VPs.

Pillars is a very good production style game. Some have called it "Caylus Light" which isn't that far off.  It uses a similar "everyone choose your actions and then execute them in a specific order" mechanic.  It's certainly more forgiving and it seems to be pretty well balanced.  It does not seem to be nearly as deep as Caylus though.  Things will tend to unfold in much the same way each game.  What variety there is mainly comes from having other players disrupt your strategy.  The game plays well with two but may be a little better with three due to the increased competition for favorable actions.  With four the game becomes almost too dependent upon luck but it's still enjoyable. The biggest advantage over Caylus is the shorter length.  This game can easily be completed in an hour with experienced players.

RATING: 7
Knowing the rhythms of the 6 turns puts you at a huge advantage over players less familiar with what's coming up. Possibly falls between two stools: too long for some; too much luck for others. One particular thing that's starting to irritate me: each turn, 4 craftsman become available; two are purchased, two gained through placement. You can use turn order to claim first choice on purchasing, but sod's law decrees that when you do that, you won't be able to buy the craftsman you want, and you won't get lucky when master builders are drawn out of the bag.

I've only played the 6 player expansion with The Pillars of the Earth, but it was a very good (if complex) game for 6 people. It kept the tense and tight feel that other games have with fewer people, and had enough random elements to make the game interesting and unpredictable. It is a little difficult to play for the first time because of the long set of rules (it is like starting with a full town built in Caylus, it is hard to decide where to go at first), but I think future playings will make the game shine as a good 6 player choice.

Update: The game seems best with 5. And although I do like the game, I absolutely hate the random drawing for turn order of the Master Builders. It is way too random, especially when the game is only 6 turns long and it can really influence what you get over someone else. I feel like that single mechanic needs to be redone, but everything else fits perfectly.

Worker-placement game based on Ken Follett's historical novels. The aim is to acquire victory points through a combination of craftsmen and resources as you play your part in the construction of a 12th Century cathedral. The strategic challenge, like in all good games of this genre, is to optimise the amount of points you can obtain with the craftsmen you have at your disposal whilst also giving consideration to not reducing your finances too much. The mechanic is very well-balanced and reduces the likelihood of a runaway leader and there is just the right level of randomness provided by the event and privilege cards. The gameplay also ties in very well with the theme, which is a feature that can often be absent in this type of game.

Worker placement with two types of workers.  Gather resources and turn them into money and points.  The dutch auction for actions on the second type of workers is pretty neat and adds a bit of randomness to the game.  Plays quickly and the enjoyment to length ratio is high. 2009/05/07

Very fun worker-placement game centered around an interesting theme (cathedral building) from an excellent book by the same name.  I always feel like I'm doing well, even when I lose, and I always want to play again to improve my score.  Games are also usually very close at the end.

The biggest problem I have is the lack of variety.  There are not enough craftsman cards.  Four are played each round, but there are only four cards per round in the box.  Thus, the same four are always available.  An expansion could really help this game.

Great gateway game. Easy and fast to play both for new and advanced players. Hardly any interaction involved but you can have some laughs during unlucky draw of builders. Beautiful board and cards are  advantages of this game ( girls love the colors ). Gameplay is fun but game can become repetitive and boring after 10 plays with the same gaming group.

Really good gateway game! Should play it with 3 or 4 players though, with two there is not enough competition to make it shine.

UPDATE: played it with four, but strangely enough didn't felt that much more competition. Sure, your three builders are totally feeling it, but that's a part of the game you almost have no influence on, as you are (too) heavy dependent on when they are taken from the bag. It felt like 'cruising' towards the end, not once having a change in tension. Shame, as the components are nice and the game is streamlined. It just doesn't hold up vs other Euro-alternatives.

I am really digging this game right now.  I enjoy the randomness of the cards and the short term/long term strategy balancing.  I was surprised at how easy it was to pick up and learn.

update : I really have the feeling this needs the expansion cards to truly make this a great game.  When I get some spare cash maybe I will give it a go but other games seem to be surpassing this at the moment.

The Bishop mechanic was ambivalent for us, buy feels like it will be of more interest with more than 2.

This game does a lot of things I quite like; the random draw from the bag is mitigated by the costs to use those workers and the game does other things quite well.

It didn't quite come together for me, but there's a decent (if slightly badly aging) game there... WWE is definitely my favourite of the two...

Looks really awesome and plays blisteringly fast which is great - however, there really isn't that much to do each round. Most people seem to concentrate on specialising in one production and crafting and stick with it through the game.  Lacks tension.

This game was quite enjoyable, the board is very nice looking but appears exceeding daunting at first glance.  The play however was a cleaver ballencing act of money, cards, bids, location etc.  Everything played really well together.  The mechanism of drawing master builders from the bag added a brilliant balance of light luck with cleaver strategic choice.  Do you spend the 7 gold and go first, or do you wait and be close to last.  I love the cathedral pieces but I do think starting the game with one as a turn counter is somewhat silly as we are supposed to be building it, cute however.  I wish some of the knowledge of the cards was available to new players, events, stuff like the bell master last turn ETC make the game a slight unfair advantage to new people, could use some variant cards to mix it up a little.  All and all good production quality, great looking game, interesting play.

This game gives me the feeling of St. Petersburg and Leonardo Da Vinci. Using a limited supply of men to acquire goods and picking up craftsman that gain victory points. It's not a bad alternative to any existing game. Given the choice between these three, I think I'd like to chew on Leonardo more. //

I like the random elements (events, privilege) that come out and you need to adapt to what happens on the board, but I think the fixed workers appearing in rounds could make the game a little stale. I would like to see maybe 6 craftsmen for the first round and randomly use 4 and then scale it down so that there are still 4 craftsman at the end so people can plan for the finish.

Love the resource management and ability to string together functions to really get a lot of output churning. I was able to come from behind and win as resources really started cranking out near the end of the game.

LOTS of hard choices to make and a little bit of messing with the other players, too.

This does feel a bit like Caylus, as you place little guys out in various parts of the board, and then walk a path giving out resources to the player that put his little guy there.  However, there are enough differences that it kept me interested.  All in all, if you like Caylus, you'll probably like Pillars as well.

An awful lot to like in this gamer's game, although I think it fails in one major regard - it borrows heavily from Caylus but, other than being a bit shorter, doesn't improve on the mechanics much. I'm also not sure I like the huge luck element of drawing placement order randomly. While paying to place first should even things out, it doesn't always seem to. The sweet spot seems to be getting lucky enough to have your pieces drawn in middle position, where you're placing early and not paying too much to do it. That said, this is a very promising game and I expect it will break into my play rotation on a regular basis.

Pillars is an rich, lengthy, interactive storybook.  The slow pace helps newbies, who will be intoxicated by the immersive theme.  Veteran gamers have more than enough to sink their teeth into, but they may also be frustrated by the slight touch of random. Overall, Pillars is one of the best resource-conversion games and should be required reading.

I love this game! A beautiful board, solid components, and a unique theme makes this a crowd-pleaser. There's a good amount of player interaction, several unique strategies to pursue, and enough variability to make every game feel a bit different. The only weaknesses here is that it's tough to stop a leader on that last turn, and the game's many choices mean it's not the best choice for new gamers.

I loved this game the first few times I played it.  It seemed like there were so many viable strategic options to try.  I now believe there are only a small handful of winning strategies, making most options superfluous and the winner being determined largely by luck of the draw.  

The implementation of theme is overly dry considering the source material.  Where's the political manouevering, the double-crossing, the intrigue?  Lush, detailed art, though.

It's not very good as a 2-player game.  Too easy to get what you want.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good game! As of now, I can merely say that this has quite a lot in common with Maestro Leonardo and the other way around. You send off your workers to get you ressources or have them work in the wool manufacture to gain you money. For your "builders" there are several options on the board to choose from, but you only have three builders. And money gets pretty scarce sometimes, so each player probably will have to pass on a leader at least once. That is, where draw of luck has a little too much impact, because the later your "pawn" is drawn (from the bag), the less you have to pay for an action. That is, if the others choose to take an action. Prices vary from 7 gold to 0 gold per action. With each action taken, the price drops down by 1. I think, to even it out a scale of 5,5,4,4,3,3,2,2 instead of 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 (not quite sure about the numbers) would fix really bad luck of draw. Which happened to one of our players not only once but three turns in a row (ok, really, really bad luck) His builder got drawn at 7 and his next at 6, so his two actions cost him 13,  whereas the ones later on could take their actions almost for free (consider 4 players, 3 builders each) Other than that, this is a very nice game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was the first worker placement game that I either played or owned.  When Agricola came out, and proved to be a much deeper and richer experience, I traded away Pillars without a thought.  

And, as it goes every now and then, I realized that it was a pretty good game.  While it is not as dynamic or varied as Stone Age, nor is it as rewarding or thematic as Agricola, it does stand on its own. 

I figure that if you have played any of the worker placement games, or if you have played a bunch of them, Pillars is still worth a look.  The placement of the master builders is a really slick and tense mechanic that is much more than a gimmick.  

It could be argued that Pillars is rote, unoriginal, and uninspired.  But I would argue that the same could be said of nearly any game.

It's been a while, but I remember two of my favorite parts in Pillars were to get the extra gray pawn on my side and get a sneak peek at the event cards. I am looking forward to playing more, I feel that with familiarity will come a better understanding of how to find a balance in the game.. I remember not doing so well at that, but still having a lot of fun!

A pretty but fiddly worker placement game. Doesn't flow that well with two. Way better with 4 players. Veterans have an unfair advantage because they understand and know the cards.

Other than that, it's an interesting game with some interesting worker placement elements and a decent blend of strategy/tactics. Works better the more you play, but it's never really inspiring.. (perhaps that changes if you've read the book.) It's also fairly repetitive.

RATING: 8
Beautiful looking board & components, except the small size cards which I generally hate (although at least this game doesn't involve shuffling large stacks of them).  Very tight economic system that forces difficult choices.  Basic strategy is simple -- get good craftsmen, get resources, and turn that into lots of VPs.  But the difference between winning and losing any game is subtle -- lots of little decisions that add up to a couple of VPs.

I think this game is great with 3 and very good with 4.  I'm not thrilled with it for 2 because there are too many good spots on the board so the builder placement decisions (and therefore cash management to preserve cash to place expensive builders) aren't as painful.

Going with an 8 on this one after a few solid plays.  I really enjoy this game but have this nagging feeling that while it's fun and I'm excited about it now that it might wear a bit and get old.  Not sure I guess I'll just have to play it a ton of times and see if that's true.

UPDATE: In light of how much I am willing to play Stone Age over this one I guess I need to lower the rating a bit. I've still not played with the expansion so that could change things up a bit too...but truth is I seem to always play this 2 player and the expansion seems a to be a bit too much for 2 players.

I know everyone originally called this "Caylus Lite" but then stopped when Caylus Magna Carta came out, since that was probably "Caylus Lite" instead.  While I haven't tried Caylus Magna Carta yet, I think that people had it right the first time.  Pillars of the Earth was unbelievably reminiscent of Caylus, which is not necessarily a bad thing since I really enjoy Caylus.  However, the master builders really ruined this game for me, which is unfortunate since Pillars had a lot of things going for it, those things being the features that it borrows from Caylus (i.e., building an engine to turn resource cubes into victory points).  The random draw of the master builders from the bags (along with the randomness of the cards) takes the concepts of Caylus out of a game that involves no luck and puts them into a game that involves a lot of luck.  This may be just what others were hoping for and enjoy most, but it's definitely not something I personally enjoy at all, especially given the alternative game (i.e., Caylus) that could be played instead.

(1 play) Economic game which seemed like it would be a good fit for me, but I was left feeling unsatisfied. The craftsmen aren't all that well-balanced, and knowing what craftsmen are going to come out is a pretty important part of the game. Also, face-to-face, it felt very fiddly (difficult to define, but there it is). I'd try it one more time, but I'm not hugely optimistic. I think the comparisons to Caylus, while somewhat valid (it's a economic game after all) are rather overblown.

The basic game is fairly straightforward. You get resources. You convert resources to VP's with craftsmen. You can get better craftsmen that more efficiently convert resources to VP's. That's essentially it.

Each round there are two phases. In the first phase you're drafting from a common pool of resources and craftsmen. In the second phase you're placing your workers on actions spots. The interesting twist to the game is that workers are drawn from a bag randomly. The first worker drawn has to pay 7 coins to take an action or pass and go stand in line. Each subsequent worker has to pay one coin less until it reaches zero. after the bag empties, the guys in line get to deploy. So you might get drawn early and really want to go first and pay the 7 coins, although money can be tight, so you won't be doing that often.

As the game progresses the craftsmen get better and better at converting goods (but you can only keep 5 resources from one round to the next). This was true to the point where I got the majority of my score in the last two rounds of the game.

I enjoyed the game. But... there's a fair bit of randomness in worker bag selection mechanism, as you really want to be chosen early, but not too early. If you're drawn too soon or too late, you'll just get screwed on worker placement. On one hand, this is the most interesting thing in the game, as it makes for some interesting choices. On the other hand, this is the most problematic issue in the game, as you can just get screwed. And the randomness seems fairly significant given the length/depth of the game. There's also a random event every round that might pile on to the randomness. I'm not sure if it's quite "too much" randomness or not.

I like drafting cards and I like the Master Builder lottery (in which in random order players are offered the chance to draft whatever they want, at a price that starts high but continually decreases) but in this game there seems to be no differentiation or urgency to anything you're drafting! The three main cube resources do exactly the same thing, just with varying parameters and synergies. As another example there are four "pay no taxes" worker placement spots on the board, in a game that maxes out at four players.

The decisions just feel inconsequential. Clearly they're not, as they (plus some luck) determine the winner. But it's so loose and unengaging.

World Without End is much more interesting.

This game is a great piece of worker placement. A lot of good questions as to whether you should keep your current craftsmen or try to upgrade at a hefty cost, when you should decide to ditch someone finally, and which of the very well-balanced locations to put your master builders in. It manages to do all this without being dry and with a good enough amount of interaction.

One of my favorite worker placement games. I love the randomness of pulling the master builders out of the bag and then deciding whether to pay place them immediately or postpone to place them later for free. Reading the book is not required to have fun playing the game, but it does add a little more flavor to it if you have. The book is great too, by the way.

I'm kind of a sucker for anything medieval or religious, so this starts out high in my estimation for that alone. But my wife loves the worker placement mechanic, and I love games I can play with my wife. That makes this one really appealing. Add to it that I enjoy Follett's novel and this seems like it could be a good game to get.

I could really love this game but for one thing: after playing several times there seems to be a lot of imbalance between the characters available each round.  Some are very strong, others very weak, and knowing which ones to target gives you a big advantage.  If this issue could be fixed then the game would skyrocket in my book, because there are so many other great things about the game.

One of my favorite games.  Of course, I read both books and that only adds to the experience because I know the characters.  However, it is a solid worker placement and economy balancing game.  Mechanics are great.  Very good theme as you in control of these master builders that you place in strategic locations to help you gather points in the game.  you also have workers that you send out and gather resources to use and convert for the main building project (the cathedral) in the center of the game.  These resources are converted into points by your craftsmen.  As time passes in the game, the craftsmen become more efficient and even different altogether.  A very unique game and is in my top 5 of all time.  The best worker placement game there is.

RATING: 8
At the beginning of the 13th century, construction of the greatest and most beautiful cathedral in England begins. Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral's construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points. Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points. Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game. Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points. Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen. Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.

Eines der wenigen Spiele die ich nach ein paar Partien wieder verkauft habe. Ich hab mich einfach gefragt warum ich dieses Spiel spielen sollte, wenn ich doch einfach etwas besseres Spielen kann in der Zeit. Man kann in dem Spiel sehr schlecht über mehr als eine Runde planen und hat damit wenig Steuerungsmöglichkeiten seines Spiels. Man kann sich vlt. eine Taktik für die folgende Runde überlegen, aber eine Strategie für das ganze Spiel zurecht legen ist nur recht schwer möglich. 
Und an sich bietet das Spiel keinen Mechanismus, den es nicht in einem anderen Spiel ebenfalls geben würde, nur halt dass da das gesamtkonzept besser passt. Statt DSDE würde ich deutlich lieber Puerto Rico oder bei kürzerem Zeitrahmen Magnis Navis o.ä. spielen. Warum das Spiel den deutschen Spielepreis bekommen hat ist mir ein Rätsel.

Relatively fast resource game with lots of "turn angst". Deserves its own space next to Caylus, because it is quicker to explain and only takes about 1,5 - 2 hours to play. Luck (the blind drawing of the Master Builders) plays quite a large role, but it fits the game (and its short length) perfectly. Components and map are beautiful. Played twice with four and once with three players (each time with a different group), and the game was a big hit on all occasions.
UPDATE: Played again recently, and the game has lost some of its appeal for me. Even with the new rules for drawing builders from the bag, that part feels too luck driven. Consequently lowered my rating with one point. I guess better games have surpassed it in recent years.

Boring.
That was what I think about the game. Although, it could be that I am burned out from worker placement games. After Agricola, StoneAge, Caylus and Co., I must say that Pillars rank the last of the lot. It just wasn't really that much fun and I will tell you why. The card selection is boring. The card set is small and the variation is limited. Even the event cards, privilege cards and the resource cards are limited. This makes the game a little off-balanced with veteran gamers because of the ability to remember the cards. Plus, I find it very unsatisfying that the resource pool is so limited. There is very you can do each round to gather or buy resources. Not exactly very satisfying. At least Stone age, the die roll makes the game a chaotic and unpredictable. Much rather play Agricola.

Well, I was predisposed not to like this game because I didn't like and couldn't finish the book, so that might explain why I didn't like it. I found it overly random and dull. The very little in this game that is new and original (the master builder drawing) is just stupid, while the majority is borrowed from other better and funner games. I don't usually enjoy drafting actions even in the best of circumstances, when there are other interesting things going on in a game, but in Pillars, the other part of the game is more drafting! Bleh. 

On the other hand, I really liked that it was so short.

I lowered my rating on this one, as we rarely seem to play.

I think that's because only a few strategies really work well. You can play others, but you will lose, and occasionally by staggering margins.

This is still one of my favorite worker placement games, though. I love the theme, and the board is magnificent.

I like how the stages of the game work, the auction for placing your workers, and how seamless it all is.

Enjoyed this game and would play it again but not one that I would actively seek out to play again. It reminded me of Kingsburg a bit where you are obtaining resources in the short term to turn into points. I personally really enjoyed pulling the last few workers out of the bag; a clever and interesting albeit luck-driven twist. A very mathematical game in terms of conversion and while I didn't feel any connection to the theme the mechanisms were solid. As solid as an Apse.

Excellent components, pretty board, some interesting mechanics-  and virtually inescapable parity.

all the actions are so close in eventual point value, and there is little to no time constraint for accomplishing particular things or reason to worry about availability of resources-  even the good point converters are in adequate abundance.  you're not really "building" an economic engine, so much as processing what you get.

i disagree with the luck complaint-  there is certainly luck involved, but the luck impact is minimal- the problem is that unless you specifically mess up (like repeatedly generating more resources than you can hold/use, or spending gold down so you lose points from taxation), you will be a contender.

high parity.  no relevant blocking. essentially no time constraint on resource processing.  no opportunism or long-term strategizing that will play out in an adequate way.  almost nothing to allow intelligent decisions to be the deciding factor.

Worker-placement game that feels too much like an unfocused patchwork which dragged on a little in our first play. Not a fan of the random events and felt there was too much luck in the card draw. The luck makes the game more tactical in nature but the choices available generally feel uninteresting. There are several other worker-placement games that are either more interesting mechanistically, more focused or integrate theme better that I would rather play, but I would oblige to try again if there was insistence. But bottom line is too much luck and too dry for game length. Components and art is however top-notch and manages to invoke the source material to some extent.

I think I expected too much from Pillars (I bought it sight-unseen per its glowing reviews).

This game is a lot like Stone Age, in my opinion.  The event cards in the game are a bit too extreme, in my opinion.  You can put a lot of planning into a turn, and then have it blown away by an event card that throws a huge random swing, to de-balance the game.

I still like the game, and I think there are ways to counteract this.  Next time I play, I'm going to turn up three event cards at a time (in advance), and then when it is time to draw an event card, I'll roll a die to pick one of the three.

What I like about the game is the wide range of choices each turn.  The results of the choices are extremely different, yet seem to be very well balanced.  Like 3-4 player stone age, there is a little opportunity to play defensively by blocking other player's moves, but there are usually alternative choices that are nearly as good, so defensive play is not a necessity to win.  

I'll bet 2-player is more cutthroat, but I don't have any experience there yet.

A pretty dry, by-the-numbers worker placement game. Doesn't really do anything interesting and I've never read the book it's based on so the theme is pretty uninspired. Building the cathedral round-by-round is cute but isn't really necessary and inflates the price for a box that's essentially 70% air. For a simpler, cheaper alternative, I'd go with Stone Age or really any other WP instead.

Lavish.  I love the art style, especially the board.  I've only played once, but from what I can tell, the gameplay is solid.  There are a bunch of neat mechanics, and the choices often are difficult.  The production and building, with requisite economy and victory points systems draws obvious inspiration from other classics, but the systems are different enough to make Pillars worth a try, if not a buy.  

I'm a bit concerned that this game is a little too random to hold the long-term attention of serious gamers, but too intricate to really appeal to a lighter crew.  The ability to grab an early powerful privilege card is fairly random, and may be enough to swing the game all on its own.  I'm not sure that seven gold is enough to pay for the master builder actions at the start of the game.  But that's based off of only one play, so don't roast me if I'm eventually proven wrong.  If given the choice to play this again, I'll probably suggest [gameid=22545].

It seems pretty common to diss this game nowadays, but I think it's excellent. I don't buy the "total luck whoever gets pulled from the bag first" claim, as you've got to be playing well to be able to afford being drawn first. Many times, I'm hoping not to be drawn first.

It's a usual "collect resources and convert them into VP" game, with a "draft" mechanic (you choose what to do by placing your men in specific areas) and quite a bit of randomness (order of play, available resources, event cards,...). 
It is unoriginal, shallow and offers little control (especially with more players).
Nice bits.

Rated after two games, once with 3 players and then with 2 players. I have not read the books, so the theme is not familiar to me. This is quite a long game, more or less similar to Caylus, where more experienced players have an advantage over rookies. The scripted plot is nice, but doesn't make good gaming experience.

I am biased because I am a huge fan of the book, but even so this is a very good game. I like the idea that everybody is working on the same project, the victor being the person who contributes the most.

It has some very interesting mechanics in it, particularly the turn order mechanic.

It is also the most beautiful of all the games I own.

Having played with the expansion, I can't imagine playing the base game again (not that I would buy this game even if it came with the expansion included). I prefer the vaguely similar Cuba, which has more flavor and real decisions. In PotE I feel that my decisions are largely insignificant, and effectively scores between players are always very close. The game also overstays its welcome by about 30-45 minutes.

Wow.  There's a lot going on in this game, and your choices are going to be limited almost every turn.  There's no small amount of randomness, given the event cards, and the way that the advantage and craftsmen cards come out, but the drawing for turn order out of the bag is probably the most significant part of the game governed by luck.  It can be frustrating when you need a specific card, and are too far down in the turn order to take advantage of it, though.  Still, the game has a lot of characteristics I like, and there are always some extra rules to help alleviate some of that luck.  Very interested in playing again.  I just wonder how long it will take before the game "plays out," what with the limited differences in the different plays.

Nowadays the workerplacement explosion has touch the very heart of my collection, there are simply to many of those guys and girls. Pillars is definately not a bad game and I'm sure I will play it someday again, but for now it is simply ballast. Some mechanics have moved along the workerplacement and pillars is a victim of this turbulence.

RATING: N/A
At the beginning of the 13th century, construction of the greatest and most beautiful cathedral in England begins. Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral's construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points. Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points. Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game. Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points. Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen. Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.

I rated this game very high (8.8) the first time i tried it but i was young back then. 
I tried it again yesterday and i had to lower my rating substantially. Let's see:
COmponents: gorgeous, wonderful map, incredibly expensive device to count the turns, nice art.
One of the first worker placement i think, so very good as far as originality is concerned.
Good enough flow of play.
Many strategies to follow.
Unfortunately all these good aspects are ruined by a very high luck factor. Events are too random and too powerful and only one player each turn can decide to protect himself , it would be better to have more spaces like for taxes exemption.
Your worker can all come out very soon or very late ruining your plans completely and the additional rule of keeping one of them aside and have them placed in reverse order is not enough. There is TOO MUCH LUCK for such a highly strategic game.

Grail game. Literature based medieval worker placement to be the most successful contributor in the construction of Kingsbridge Cathedral.  Elegant play with two main phases. Begins with a card draft of craftsmen and resources followed by an interesting pouch draw for "pay or pass"  worker action placement phase.  Interesting value decisions on size of work force employed to complete actions.  Tight gold with plenty of ways to foil opponent plans. Satisfying progression of developing your team of craftsmen to leverage resource conversion, work force and gold generation in a competitive challenge that integrated well with its theme.

Money can be used to buy the services of tradesmen who are more proficient and yield more victory points for fewer resources.  Tricky and challenging.

This is a good one.  It's worker placement like Agricola, but with an added randomness twist, because the turn order is determined by pulling the pieces out of a bag.  More decisions come into play when your piece is pulled early in the turn, because the first 7 placements cost money.  Another nice aspect is that the more powerful craftsmen appear later in the game, and grabbing these can propel lagging players into contention or even the lead.

Played a few times on BSW (mainly with 2, but also with 3 or 4). While the game is interesting (and from what I have seen, the material of the actual board game is nice too), I am not a big fan of the randomness in the drawing of the builders out of the bag. Also, I am concerned one of the craftsmen could be a bit over-powered (selling wood for 4 gold is really nice - but it can be beaten) and that the replayability of the game is not so high, because of the way the craftsmen always appear in the same order. Still, it is quite enjoyable. My rating is likely to change either way after more plays, depending on how much the replayability and balance issues were valid.

I don't understand why such a success after 10 games, and I realy tried to like it. The more I play the less I like. I bought because I read it is a lighter version of Caylus, which would be an excellent choice to introdude Caylus -a great game- to beginers, however, the similarities to Caylus are building something and managing resources, nothing more than that, it the same comparison of a Porshe and a Trabant because both are German cars. The only pro is the gorgeous components. Sold my copy after 1 game. I rate 2 because of the beautiful components, othewise would have be a 1.

It's a complex game with very simple strategies (but a little bit of Analysis-Paralysis). Players try to score points by different ways (by converting resources or making direct points). There are more tricky ways to get resources, and players must watch what others are doing. Takes too long for what the real gameplay is (that is, the last two turns). I like it better for two people.

{ P - [3] 4 5 }

Post-Caylus worker placement with less complexity and more uncertainty. After a couple games discerning players should experience instances where they feel very powerless. The process of placing workers is one example: players don't place one worker at a time, they're simply pulled from a bag so chance can determine whether you get the opportunity to place on a desired spot for the desired cost. I like the idea - an option to pay or bid to place a worker before others but deciding randomly who can is not the right execution. Other issues: only seven of the nine commodity cards see play during any given round, so there's the chance resources some players need can become arbitrarily scarce and force them to waste a master builder at the market. Event cards are another blind-fate mechanic that randomly rewards or rebukes players, and not going last is so vital to have a shot at new craftsmen during the resource buying phase that turn order must switch every turn. This process isn't automatic; you must use a master builder. The original first player will only need to spend once while the other two players spend twice.

Pillars of the Earth is a simple yet fun worker placement , resource conversion game. It scales well with 2-4 players but different strategies present themselves based on the number of people. While one strategy might seem like a guaranteed victory one game, the next game it might be irrelevant. It also makes you think about taking  some risks while never really keeping you that far away from potential victory. The game also plays easily within an hour to hour and a half once you understand the mechanics of the game.

I have played this game more times than is shown but that was well before I joined BGG. Having played a multitude of other games since rating this originally, I could see how this rating might actually rise a bit as it is quite a great game when taken in to context of the complexity, etc. It also has some interesting game mechanics that I haven't seen in other games, like the pulling the pawns from the bag to determine who places first and the associated cost to do so.

I could see how the game could feel "samey" over time as there are limited cards in the game and you generally can figure out strategies from the get-go. The variability comes from the timing of when those cards come out, how contested the particular cards are and whether or not you've left a little wiggle-room in your strategy to adapt and/or money in your coffers to over pay to place first for that card that you really want.

All in all I think that this is a very enjoyable "gateway +" game and I'd like to find the expansion to it as I think that it would bump up the rating of this game from very good to great.

Enjoyable game. One complaint is the fixed end game. Makes sense I guess but sometimes feels like it should go another round. But the design is solid - the board is beautiful - and it is a simpler game than Calus and more exciting to me. We find this a good couples game and we seem to play this over Princes Of Florence which for some reason seems to fall into the same grouping for us.

I liked this game a bit better than Caylus, and it has cubes.  Donnnie said that it ran much more smoothly that Caylus does, and I have to agree.  I don't like the player number restrictions, and it wouldn't be good with two players, okay with tree, and only great with 5, but does not contain the provisions for 5.  The tight numbering is due to the fewer options for your primary playing pieces (master builders) on the game board.

This is a fantastic game...appeals to those who like Power Grid, Leonardo da Vinci or Caylus.  Rules are easy to learn from someone as the first two.  It has as much depth to it as Caylus without being as much of a brain burner.

(Trade Interest: medium) for a Caylus knockoff, it is actually pretty good.  the components are good, although pretty standard for Euro-fair.  The board is colorful and "pretty", and very functional.  It details mostly everything you need to know.  There is less direct conflict than in Caylus, and i guess some people would say that is a good thing.  i'm not sure.

What a lovely game! First of all it's drop dead gorgeous. Second, the gameplay is tons of fun. This is a great introduction to worker placement. I have however since found that many other games do worker placement much better, and have replaced the need for this game in my collection.

This is a fun worker placement-y, resource engine game.  I have quite a good time playing it, but find the random bag pull for the master builders to take too much of the strategy of placing workers out of the game and leaves the good plays in the hands of lady luck.  For some games I rather enjoy that... but for a Euro this involved I want more control over what I'm doing...

This game falls in the same category as games like Caylus and Keythedral, with which it shares some similarities, namely the kind of game where you have to optimize converting your resources, in this case money and workers (which also translate directly into money) to cubes and then turning those cubes into either more resources, or VPs. This is not the kind of game that I typically enjoy, but as far as those games go, I thought this one was particularly well done. Sometimes a bit dry and mathematical, and the improving quality of the available worker cards as rounds go by feels a bit artificial, but the mechanics serve their purpose. Various event cards add a bit of extra theme and spice to the game. I liked the random drawing of the "Baumeisters" mechanic, to introduce a bit of uncertainty and excitement in the game. Then again, this same mechanic may determine the winner in the last rounds, as scores are close and the cards up for grabs in the last round will make all the difference. I do think there are enough ways to prepare for this final round and you can play around the luck factor. Not a Spiel des Jahres candidate, it is a tad too gamery for that, but all in all a very solid offering from Kosmos.

So I was totally wrong about this game.  I will admit that I scoffed at it when everyone was playing Pillars of the Earth a couple of months ago.  It did not interest me in the least at that time, and as it started to win awards, I often wondered to myself "what is the big deal?"

Well, it seems that I have been missing out.  Pillars of the Earth turned out to be quite a clever game in managing and converting resources into points.  I like the many choices the players can select from, as they assess what they can afford to give up and to take a chance at against the things they really need.  However, the other side of that is as the board starts to fill up, almost always someone will be left with options they don't need, and to me that indicates poor design when you are forced to do take an action that has absolutely no effects on you.  Tied to that is the drawing of the master builders.  It's true that those who get to select first will have to pay the most as well, but it is still possible for everyone else to go before you costing them virtually nothing if your color comes out last.  The fact there is no way to mitigate this chance, no matter how small, really hurts the game.

Not bad... it has the feel like it's a cross between Stone Age and Caylus.  However, it's a much better than Stone Age, but not quite as good as Caylus.  

Scratch that... now that I've played Stone Age a bunch and got better at it, I'd say these two games are just about even.

After 2+ Plays: Despite the ubiquitous comparison to Caylus, I found this to be quite a different, though enjoyable, experience.  The luck didn't really bother me; I thought it was just right for a game of this length.  It doesn't have the depth of Caylus and I don't see it becoming a mainstay, but at this point I'm looking forward to another play.  Worth playing at least once to marvel at the beautiful board design: great art with 3 different number tracks seemlessly integrated.

Is it Caylus light? I don't care it sure is a very nice game. Altough you find a lot of elements/mechanism elsewhere there's enough to justify this great game. Should be great as a nice game that fills the gap between medium and heavy game. Some luck but lots of decision to be made (is that correct english?). Overall an excellent game. Nice components, great dark graphics, good theme and well working mechanisms! Updated to a 9 after several plays with different groups.

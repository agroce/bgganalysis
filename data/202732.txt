Σίγουρα είναι πολύ διασκεδαστικό, απλό, έξυπνο κ.τ.λ. αλλά για την ώρα (3-4 plays) μου φαίνεται ότι έχει λίγο περισσότερη τύχη από όσο θα ήθελα.

RATING: 6.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Raise your Goblets is a beautiful, crazy and chaotic game that works really well in a party-like situation. The length, the number of players supported and also the high quality of components, that will easily catch people's attention, make it a good choice for that kind of environment. There's not a lot of decisions to be made nor real depth, but this game does its job. It's silly fun. People will laugh, make jokes, spin the goblets around and get excited when it's the moment to "drink" and see if you survived or not.

My only concern would be with the re-playability. I don't think it's the kind of game worth owning, simply because I would probably get tired of it pretty quickly. I wouldn't be opposed to play it every now and then though. Nice game!

Le prime impressioni sono sicuramente positive visto soprattutto l'effetto scenico che fa tutto il materiale disposto sul tavolo, dalla lettura del regolamento si intuisce un gioco divertente e spensierato pensato per passare un'oretta in allegria senza prendersi troppo sul serio e anzi farsi un paio di risate tra amici.

Party game.
Elke speler heeft een beker waarin je rode (wijn), zwarte (vergif) of witte (healing) steentjes doet.  Je kan bekers verschuiven met je acties, erin kijken, enz...
Op het eind van de ronde krijg je punten als je nog leeft (minder zwarte dan witte), of je wijn hebt gedronken, en of je je vijand hebt kunnen vergiftigen.
Zeer flauw spel, doch wel mooie componenten (bekers en steentjes).
Goed geheugen helpt om te weten waar je gegooide steentjes zitten.  Niets voor mij dus.

Not a strategic game but more of a luck based, social game. Great for a big group. The theme came through nicely. The components were perfect. A few different ways to play. It was enjoyed by all. A great filler. Especially for those groups that aren't too competitive. If you love the Princess Bride scene with the wine glasses, you'll love this.

Good for parties and large groups. Makes wife happy. Not super strategic, but fun bluffing/social game. There is some strategy in the mind game department. People who don't like it seem to think they should have won, because the game is too "random". The game is deliberate, not random. People are choosing to move things around. You have to be tricky and devious. That's difficult. 1st person to call for toast does have a big advantage admittedly. But there are ways to manipulate that. You can confuse the 1st player by always placing stuff in the goblet they place in or the ones they peak at, so they are uncertain which goblet is safe. This way the first player will be less likely to call the toast and give you a chance to call it. You have to be watching your opponents, and try to guess what they are up to.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Cute breezy fun. The high novelty factor really makes this game. If you didn't have actual goblets I'm not sure anyone would give it the time of day. It's pretty sub-par as far as bluffing games go - being able to [i]always[/i] grab any glass via swapping is extremely powerful, and turn order for the final round is HUGE. There's basically no reason the person who calls for a toast shouldn't wind up with at least 2 points.

I say 2 and not 3 because I'm not convinced you have any real control over killing your target. You can try and bluff them into thinking a cup is safe and that you're going to try to take it for yourself, but they're better off just ensuring a cup is safe for themselves and trying to grab that.

I really do like the way the wine tokens / calling a toast works, though. It gives the game that much little bit of needed uncertainty, and makes for some nice dilemmas - do you think someone else is gunning to toast? So should you try to beat them to it or do you have time to spread some poison or enrich something for yourself?

I suppose my beef with this game is there are a TON of light silly games out there, and a ton of them are bluffing games - but the very best of them still have room for extremely clever plays and drama. Raise Your Goblets does not. What it is, though, is a [i]just pleasant enough[/i] way to spend 20 minutes.

Honestly the 2-3p game ("Russian Goblette") sounds pretty fun. I'd like to try that at some point.

This almost Rated a 7 for me.
With my kids (playing without characters), ages 4, 6 and 8, this game is a riot and would rate it a 7 or 8.
It plays quick, (mostly due to me getting rid of my wine in the first 2 turns) and fun.
I normally don't Peak in my goblet either.  Their faces are too easy to read.  But funny to watch.

Comment:
This game is hilarious.
It's easy to get it on the table and players into it, BUT it's way more chaotic and unpredictable than I initially thought.
There's almost no chance to predict or even control the outcome of a course and so some games feel like pure luck...
Nevertheless it looks great, plays fast and is always good for a laugh.

Maybe I'm just bad at it, but there doesn't seem to be any way to actually deduce the contents of a goblet. It seemed like I was just picking one arbitrarily. 

I also disliked the goblet design. There are no opaque covers for the glasses. I know wine glasses don't usually have lids, but I'm tall enough that I have to hunch over in an uncomfortable way to avoid accidentally seeing inside the glasses. It seems like that could have been fixed with a circular bit of cardboard to cover the top.

Didn't like it. Felt like a game that expects you to remember too much with too much randomness involved to be worth that remembering. Also the variable player powers felt very unbalanced.

Light-ish take on Mascarade, which is not really controllable but is a mite less chaotic thanks to the goblets being identified by colour. One of those that is difficult to place into a games session due to its lack of weight and reliance on large numbers, but a useful standby for those occasions. Nice dig at the Legacy concept in the rulebook, too.

I'm actually too clumsy for this game. Merely being under the effect of small amounts of coffee I repeatedly knocked over my goblet. :D Maybe it just wasn't my day.

It was a pretty awesome session I had. I still wouldn't get it for my collection because I don't think the fun and replayability in the box justifies its size. Of course that's because of the large goblets and if I had more space and money and more game-nights fitting this style of games it 'might' make my collection. That not being the case however ... I won't buy it. I'll gladly play again though given the chance.

Fun slightly longish filler that has some really nice bluffing mechanics. It's cool that you've got a bunch of powers that can do different things, and it really forces you to pay attention to what everyone does. It of course lends itself wonderfully to throwing out Princess Bride quotes, and I enjoy the banter this game generates. I do wonder, however, if over time, this would outstay its welcome, as the gameplay does seem to have a little thinkiness to it over something like Liar's Dice or Skull and Roses.

RATING: 5
Light and silly game for up to 6 people (or more if playing with teams), very random (all random?). The game is 3 rounds, and we played them all wrong! However, I think we got closer and closer to the correct rules each round! 

Fun time with the group, but not at all my kind of game!

--- Summary ---
Everyone is given a random character, with a unique player power, a goblet, and a mix of wine, poison, and antidote tokens, and a target player. The goblets are seeded with a random token as well. Then, in turn order, players take 2 actions:
- add a token (keep hidden) to any goblet
- rotate all goblets 
- swap any 2 goblets
- toast, but only as your first (and only) action, and only if you have no wine tokens remaining. 
Character powers (wide variety) come into play at various times. When toasting, everyone reveals the tokens in their goblets: if you have more poison than antidotes, you die! Score 1VP if your victim died, 2VP if you survived, and 1VP if you have the most wine tokens (whether or not you lived).

After 3 rounds (new Characters and targets dealt each time), most VP wins!

Social deduction and memory party game simulating the old poisoned wine shell game.

Never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line.

Amusing idea, as you try and poison your target at a royal party. Great components, with plastic tokens (wine, poison, antidote) and goblets. The player powers can vary quite a bit, and you can't mitigate everything, but there is sort of an amusing meta (will they load their own cup with poison... or someone else?). Still, probably a bit too random for long-term play.

Demanding memory aspect. You have to remember what you 'think' someone put in each cup during a round which will be 20+ times. Whoever toasts is in a very strong position being able to go last. Players do not enough control.

Game components are beautiful, but the game is not working as expected. The flow is ok until the last part of each round where everyone gets one more action. That completely breaks the game in so many ways.

House rules to improve the experience:
- Avoid playing the last round. As soon as someone makes the toast, is over.
- Swapping takes the two action points you have.
- Characters that give you double VP by killing or surviving should be removed.

A dos jugadores no vale ni para tirarlo a la basura, muy chulo a nivel de componentes, las copas muy bonitas de plastico , el veneno,antidoto y vino, muy chulo.
Interesante a nivel tematico, pero el juego no es en absoluto para dos jugadores. Soso y malo

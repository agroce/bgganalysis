Hmm, this might be worth checking out once it hits the stores. The outrageous postage makes Kickstarting a US-only option.

[-]I just hope the KS makes less than $40,000 so that they'll stick with wooden components.. plastic is usually a mistake.[/-]

Oh, damn.. I'm happy the project got a decent amount of funding, but I really would have preferred wooden components.

Solid pick-up-and deliver game which goes on for a little too long and doesn't feel entirely balanced. Lots of fun interaction and great artwork/components help but the elaborate production does impede function too often.

There must be some quality to the game since I didn't wish it to and while playing. There are some serious balance issues with the characters but personally I wouldn't mind. It just adds to the character of the game. The 7-player game worked like a charm, too, and there was relatively little downtime. I also liked the graphics and some game mechanical choices.

However, I feel that I wouldn't be playing this too often. Hence a SIX (which is still quite solid).

Great pick up and deliver game with a steam punk theme and huge blimps. Honestly, the blimps are too big. Other than that the modular board and beautiful art with solid if not particularly noteworthy mechanics make this a really fun play. I would like to play it more. It can run a little long but not terribly so. Maybe 2-3 hours.

Good chunky bits.  Good game length.  Great art and theme.  But the play is nothing too exciting.  Imagine pick-up-and-deliver with some light route-building and move-programming.  Doesn't seem like there's enough interesting moves to make on the board.  You can spend much of the game building up your aircraft for points at the game end...and that's not really much fun.  It's a pleasant game, but I won't be picking it up.

The game wasn't BAD I just don't feel compelled to play it again. The strange turn pacing made me feel like the game peaked in turn 3 or 4, with 5 left cleaning up the leftovers. The little blimps were cool, but the game itself felt pretty meh.

I did like the pre-programmed moves, but robo-rally does it better.

I like the gameplay of KoAaS, but the full complement of 7p can get pretty darn bogged down when people are slow. Programming your zeppelin to fly around and pick stuff up was very satisfying once you actually got to accomplish it. The pick and up and deliver is solid.

I also haven't played with the special characters, but I have some worries that they are a bit too unbalanced. This BGG poll has some good tips about which characters are high or under powered:

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1005311/character-overpowered-poll

I would like to try it more with the characters. But I think it would be wise to not play with obviously strong or weak characters unless you would like somebody to have a boost or handicap. Reasonable if you have new or very experienced gamers playing together.

Not everyone's cup of tea, but I like the mix of roborally planning mechanic with pick up and delivery.  Though I am now convinced that the first game for newbies should be done using the base game and not the normal game.  You really need to get the basic mechanic down first.

A fun next-step pick up and deliver game. "Next-step" in that it is not a game to first introduce people into gaming, but also not too complicated to be that much of a brain burner to others.

Has a lot of cool functioning parts that work together and the player boards further aid in gameplay, detailing the phases of a turn, the actions available and on how end game scoring works.

Some issues I do have with this otherwise great game however are the over-sized airships which don't really function too well and with whether or not some ships/ captains are truly balanced from the rest (i.e. perpetual motion ability).

Overall a lot of fun to be had for 7, with smaller player counts taking less time (but be sure to look for the alternate 4 board set up for 3-4 players).

Rather light game of pick-up, drop-off, and deliver.  I'm not sure how much the programmed movement adds to the game, except that it adds a significant layer of chaos to the whole exercise.  I'm also not convinced that the special abilities are that balanced.

RATING: 7
The production quality on this game is quite good.  Since the kickstarter project was overfunded, several components are a notch up from standard fair.  The boards look like they may suffer or are at risk of wrapping - most likely due to the standard printing risks, but the remainder of the components are well done, cleanly printed and cut.

At the heart of this game is the pick-up and deliver mechanism.  Game play is straight forward, easy to teach, but each turn presents a set of options.  The semi-programmed airship movement is flexible enough to adapt to other players, but in reality, if you can't follow through with your plan, you'll likely be fighting a strong uphill wind to have your turn proof effective.  The train mechanisms are also straight forward, but there is a tad bit of awkwardness to it.  The game wants you to think about balancing airship and trains but doing so is extremely hard to accomplish - mainly because the bonuses for upgrades force you to pursue one or the other more strongly.  While some may dislike this aspect of the game, it is likely one of the factors that makes it stand out from a myriad of similar style games.  The hardest aspect of the game to get a balancing sense for are the individual ship captains.  The special powers are interesting and play into the rest of the mechanisms quite well, but there seem to be an odd assignment of the character #s (used for turn order tie-breakers).  Some specials appear quite powerful and have low turn order positions, while others appear weaker and end up near the top.  It likely boils down to character mix in the game that determine how well this plays into effect.  

Overall, the game is pretty good.  It's likely a very solid game for 2011, but by its release in 2013... it has a vague sense of sameness.  Should you try it?  Absolutely!  The game is unique enough that it will find a happy home for many players.  For some, it is likely to fair to middle.  The game is very much in line with the style of other titles from TMG - so if that floats your boat well, this is likely to scratch your itch as well.

Actual competition for goods occurs too infrequently so the game drags on too long and creates not enough intensity.

RATING: 5
The thing I most enjoyed about this game is the per-programming mechanism where players are trying to find the best moves. Not only are you trying to find the greatest return, you also need to be careful to not place yourself in a precarious situation where other players may screw up your plans beyond recovery. 

But like many area-control games, the game is very susceptible to kingmaking (intentionally or unintentionally). And obviously, there are balance issues with the special characters/abilities and how they interact with each other. It's a fun game with a moderate brain-burn and one that most gamers will find enjoyable.

Components: Love the artwork, but the blimps are much too large. Furthermore, the cards need different colors/symbols in order to make accessing player-order quicker.

Major nit: I dislike pre-programming movement cards.  I like the fact that short movements have higher initiative than long, but the pre-programming stage is un-fun and really the slowest part of the game.  I think a movement "fuel consumption" system would work better: receive fuel allotment at beginning of round (based on Airship upgrade level) and spend throughout round as desired.  Perhaps even carrying over excess fuel to future rounds.

Minor nit: The character and 13th card benefits are pretty easily translated into VP and they clearly are not balanced... however, because you can calculate the benefits, I believe you could ensure that each player gets a character that is more closely balanced than random draw.

We (15 yr old son, 13 yr old daughter and I) like this game so far. It has a cool theme and great art with no elements inappropriate for families. I think it will be more fun on future plays now that we have a better idea of how it works and how we can mess with each other (looking forward to trying the cutthroat layout). 

The only negative aspect of the game is planning 4 moves at once. I suffer from AP so my kids had to do some thumb twiddling at times. But they still had fun. I wonder if planning only one or two moves at time would be better. But that might negatively effect the game in some other way. And maybe next time I'll play with a basic ship and no captain to level the field some.

Component quality is high. The only improvement I'd like is to have the airship and train upgrade tracks punched through so the markers wouldn't move around so easily.

At this point, I'm rating the game an 8 and I'm really looking forward to playing it again. I think it will have great replayability and is a good length -- long enough to be satisfying, but not so long that it would be hard to fit into an afternoon or evening session.

My initial impression of the game is very good. I liked the mechanisms, game looks good and it left me feeling good (even though I did not win the first game we played). Rules book was also very well layed out which I nowadays appreciate a lot.

Interesting see how my initial reaction changes with more plays but for now I'm happy about owning the game.

EDIT:

Played the game two times with roles and even though they do bring some flavor to the game roles are also quite unbalanced. Thus I'll probably play further games without them.

The game itself is enjoyable and I see more plays of it in the future.

Feels a little dry at times. Fly to cubes, pick up cubes, put down cubes, sell cubes, put more cubes on the board, make train routes, planning your movement four turns at a time. None of those things sounds fun. So there's that. But man does this game shine when it's competitive. You see that gold, and gold is selling for a high price and you just KNOW that they are going to try to get it. You need to think of a plan A, B and C. That unfortunately causes the planning round to drag ass, but when you execute and start working with what you got and guessing what others are going to try, it can get fierce in a good way. Art is great, components great, just like every TMG title. I could live without steampunk in my life as far as theme goes, but I rarely play games for theme alone.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression:

Huh.  Well that was cute.  We've got a tight little pick up and deliver game here, combined with special powers, plotted movement, and two layers of networks.  Everything feels very clean, but not too restricted (I mean--it is a game about AIR ships, after all).  My first impression is generally favorable.  I've been looking for a mid-weight route building/pick-up-and-deliver game for awhile and this one plays quickly and looks nice.  However, I just don't know how much is really there.  

I think many will dimiss it out of hand.  You'll find none of the resource conversion gymnastics that so many mistake for depth (and all but ensure Terra Mystica's rapid rise to the top).  Nope, sorry folks, there's just one currency in this game and it converts 1:1 to victory points.  This is a good sign, but I'm not sold quite yet.  As I said, the game feels very open, and it seems like, in the early game, players figure out some good routes, then go about seeing if their suppositions will lead them to victory.  That's not to say the game is entirely strategic.  There are plenty of moments when players can make tactical pivots but they might lack the drama that a stolen cube can instill in a game of AoS.  

So, in short, it's mildly promising, but its also has a loose action economy that may not hold my attention.

Goods shipping game with an element of roborally programming. This is an ok game that I would play again. There was a lot of downtime in the game (although we were playing with 7 players). Because the turns go in order of priority it can drag as unlike roborally there are still many decisions to make on a players turn after you play your card. So it can take a while. 

Even with 7 players there wasn't a lot of player interaction. There were a couple of situations where goods were snatched from under another players nose, but the pirate ship never got to steal and the use of other players depots doesn't really add much because it is difficult to tell who is actually winning at any point in time.

If I was to play again, I think playing with 3-4 players would be better and it would no doubt play faster on the second run through. 

Fantastic artwork and components.

Very fun game, I really felt like I was piloting my ship trying to deliver the best goods.

I liked the programming of moves, the building of depots, and determining how much you wanted to upgrade your ship or your train tracks.

The market felt a bit weird, and the production phase felt odd as well. I can't put my finger on it.

At this point I would gladly buy it. Would like to play a few more times.

Players are railroad ears in an alternate history America.  Factories produce goods, which must be railed into towns that demand them.  Strangely, however, the factories aren't on the rail network, so must be freighted by airship to a depot on the railway!

Simple port of the Age of Steam genre, with the tight bidding/financial system replaced by a pre-planning Robo-Rally like airship movement system.  The rest is very familiar to cube delivery railroad gamers.  Fun, lovely presentation, but ultimately very vanilla.   

Very pretty and accessible, but not a lot here if you've played Age of Steam.

Multilevel pick up and deliver game. There's no glaring problem with the design or concept, but I thought the game was just not interesting enough. There are many more interesting heavy pick up and deliver games (list many Wallace or other train games here) and there's at least one light pick up game I can think of (Auf Ausche). I don't know what to think of the programmed movement, it did handle a high play count well, but with the size of the board it did not create too much conflict. In the past I have complained about middle weight games that are ultimately squeezed out by really good light and heavy games of a similar taste; Kings of Air and Steam may just be book-ended by simply better Pick up and deliver titles.

I had a ton of fun with this new concept for a train game. The rules were clean and tight. Not at all fiddly. Sure, the airships are too big for the board, but this wasn't really an issue.

I feel like ten years ago, this would have won all sorts of awards, but in 2012 there are so many train games out there, that this one got lost in the shuffle. It's a shame, because it's quite good.

Aránylag könnyed pickup and delviery. Érdelességét az adja, hogy a roborallyhoz hasonlóan programozós, tehát előre ki kell találni 5 lépésedet. A tábla gyönyörű, rengeteg az alkatrész,a  léghajók kifestve nagyon jól mutatnak. Akár 7-en is lehet játszani, és tényleg lemegy kb. másfél óra alatt. Kettesben akár 40 perc alatt is.
Vannak különböző "fajok" így elég sok mindent ki lehet próbálgatni, mielőtt megunhatná az ember. 
Viszont talán maga a játékmenet kicsit egysíkú.

Have mixed feelings on this game.  It had a lot of good points:
* 2 stage delivery mechanic works well
* art and production values are excellent
* I'm a big fan of modular maps for replay
* The engine building aspect is promising, if flawed (see below)
* Seems to genuinely scale for more players
* The programming system seems thematic.  I would normally be hesitant for this kind of mechanic, but it seems to make sense for a blimp riding the wind, and upgrading your blimp gives you some advantages.

On the negative side, I felt the balance overall was ok to poor:
* overall player interaction is low, possibly very low.  It's true there can be some important moves where you're scrambling to beat another player to an action or factory, but it's also true you can be almost completely unobstructed for the entire game.  The game really loses something with low interaction.
* the engine building aspect is just plain off IMHO.  Upgrading your blimp is relatively expensive, and the benefits relatively low.  Building depots is relatively poor in terms of building your engine (but are a huge for scoring.)
* the scoring is off.  You have what is essentially a default action to spend 4 on a depot (3 for one of the characters) to gain 10 vp.  It's not easy to do better than a depot, so it's quite limiting to game strategy.
* Overall, you're better off avoiding people than competing, and the benefits of interacting are quite low compared with the risk.  Obviously if you have the capability to "steal" a shipment by getting there first, you would do so, but there's no real decision there when t comes to risk/reward.
* Upkeep is also counter-productive to decision-making. You don't want cubes at the end of the round, because it's virtually impossible to make up the upkeep cost (end of game clearing is one case, however). Again, this limits longer term strategy. 
* the market chaos tends to reward players randomly.  If this were better implemented, the market phase would add nuance to your planning, but instead, just tends to be a random give-away.  Sometimes it affects decision making, but often, not.
 
This is a game I wanted to like.  So many things are well done with the production, theme, and game idea.  However, the game was just meh IMO because the design avoids tough implementation decisions about balance, by making it better to avoid interaction.  For some people, I'm sure the randomness makes the game fun and light, but I actually saw potential for a better game, and left a little unsatisfied.  YMMV

Robo Rally meets Steam - another TMG "copy of another game" game - combines RR pre-planned move selection with the basic pick-up-and-deliver of any number of train games. The "normal" game has a-symmetrical player abilities and it appears that a couple are quite a bit better than others as are certain VP options. Handles up to 7 but hangs around way to long at the higher player count.

Rules are clear and well set out. Components are good and colourful although the air-ships are way to big relative to the hex grid on the board resulting in some fiddliness, and paper money is a poor choice for any game. Meh.

Kickstarter purchase.  Played a single 7-person game so far, but it was very fun.  The visual attractiveness of the board and pieces while the game is playing is a 10.  The game isn't too difficult to figure out, which is always nice, but packs in enough choice and different victory paths to allow for a lot of replay value.  Overall, happy so far.

Interesting!  I quite enjoyed this one--I may like it either more or less on future plays. It's a pick-up-and-deliver game with AIRSHIPS, so, you know, that's already kind of awesome.  In reality, a lot of it is about planning; there is a timing element to the game that requires things to get to the right place at the right time, but at the same time, there's definitely a dearth of available actions, so players have to be very careful. There's a Roborally aspect to it which I'm not sure that I care for--but then, maybe it is pretty interesting, after all. That part is something I could judge better if I knew it better. But the idea of getting something to the right place with a train, so you can pick it up and deliver it with your airship is delightfully absurd as well as a little thinky.  I approve. A seven for now, but it's close to an 8 and possibly could be with more plays.  (1 play)

RATING: 8
After one play, the official verdict is: very enjoyable. I think the game length is pretty perfect. Things might start getting a little tedious if it went on for more than a couple rounds longer, so I'm glad they capped it at number of turns rather than playing to a specific dollar amount. I played with 2, and I think it would go well up to 4 players. Any more players than that and I suspect the downtime will become a problem. Then again, I'm notoriously not a fan of playing most games with the full complement of players. Perhaps it's not overly fair of me to publicly speculate (yet here I am! publicly speculating! what is wrong with meeeeeeeeee?).

I enjoy this game in spite of it's shortcomings.

Biggest problem is that each player usually ends up just cycling through a couple of spaces on the board for the whole game, there isn't much incentive for the player's to get stuck in to eachother and mix things up. Probably a good thing since otherwise the programmed movement part of it would be extremely punishing.

About as average a game as you can find.

This is quite a good game. It's pretty and I enjoy the variable player powers.  I love pick up and deliver anyway and the robo-rally style movement is fun and provides a neat change of pace.  The variable setup is great and it's nice that it has but a few fairly short turns.  Most games of this style take much longer, and lately I have been appreciating this more.

Solid game, but I wouldn't choose it over several other pick-up-and-deliver games. The core of the game, whereby you must pick up stuff with your zeppelin then drop it off at one of your train stations, then deliver it the rest of the way on the rails, didn't feel so much thematic as it did a contrived logistical challenge. But mostly I just don't usually care for programmed movement.

An under-appreciated game! The game plays very smoothly, and the different character abilities give lots of variety. However, the abilities are far from balanced, and the game really encourages you to build lots of train stations (this seems to be the main thing you should do if you want to win).

This game is a really winning combination of programmed movement, pick-up and deliver, economics, and special powers. If you dislike any one of these features, it probably isn't the game for you, but I think that the way they have put these pieces together works very well and make a pretty unique and interesting game.

This offers some fun as a moderately complex pick up and deliver. The pick up spaces seem limited and the airships flexible so there was a lot of competition for resouces. Resorces are delivered through depots which you can place to get victory points. Your airship can be upgraded to use special cards. Your train can be upgraded to ship through more depots. Both upgrades can offer victory points. The airships do look really cool.

The first word that comes to mind after playing this game is: cluttered. The board is cluttered with cubes of various colors and its extremely hard to see depots and factories and airships. Really, really bad visual design.

The actual gameplay was a bit disappointing. It was too straightforward. Pickup cubes and sell them off. Thats it. Even the market system was boring. Prices move predictably (and without players being able to affect it). Boring economic system.

Played once. I thought it was average as I was playing, but it got better and better and now I can't stop thinking about the game. The more I think about it, the more I want to play again.  I think my rating will go up with more plays.  I played with three players on a standard set up (five hexes) and it felt too open. I don't know if three would be too tight, but four probably wouldn't work, so maybe three isn't the right player count for this one. I also hated the way start player worked. Ties abounded and so one player almost always was first to go.  Didn't matter much in our game because we were all basically in our own corners doing our own thing, but I could see this being a real issue on a tighter setup. I also think this game really needs contracts.  I heard they had some in the failed kickstarter...if they ever get printed I will be first in line to buy them.

One play so far, I lost in a big way but really enjoyed the game and look forward to playing again. The random boards and characters give this game major replay-ability. Recommended!

Second play last night and I increased my ranking to a 9.5. Using the characters and abilities added a whole new level to this game. Easily a game I will play over and over again.

Had a chance to play with 6 players and now I really want to try with all 7. This game gets better each time I play it.

Played 3 players on the cutthroat map last night, yet an entire other element to this game. It was fun actually having to battle with others for goods in such a small map area.

A steampunk themed pick up and deliver game. The theme is almost nonexistent aside from the fact that your plastic miniature is in the shape of a blimp. The component quality is pretty high, however, and the game itself has many rewarding choices. I'm not generally a big fan of pickup and deliver games but I wouldn't mind playing this one. There is tons of replayability in this game and the different ship schematics and role abilities add even further options to customize the experience. Decent Kickstarter offering.

Played a couple of 2 player games which were nice. From those plays it seems like 4 would probably be a sweet spot. More player interaction/competition without the board being too open. Not a very heavy game though so even with the variable powers I could see the replay value being on the lower end of average. Where it would fill the best gap is games that casual gamers can enjoy and play well but still offer something interesting for gamers like me.

Played twice, 2p, 4p.  This game was great.  Cube delivery with route building, planned movement, infrastructure upgrading, and a set number of turns.

RATING: 6.5
I'm really not big on the "traveling merchant" mechanic which is at the core of KoAaS.  Physically, the production value is OK but the ships are too big to coexist in a space despite being allowed to.  It's also a bit long for what it is and play is overall sort of bland.  On the upside, it's relatively simple to teach and it supports up to 7 players, which could justify owning this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Think a blend of RoboRally and pick up & deliver with big plastic dirigibles!  Dirigibles and railroad can be upgraded to allow for more movement and potentially more end game points as well.  Depots also score 10 points but more importantly grant you places to land your dirigible to drop off the goods which can be sent via train to the city markets.  There can and will be some nastiness as an opponent will scoop up the goods you were planning to pick up right before you if you aren't careful.  While this game can play seven, I'm not certain I would ever want to do so.  The advanced game also adds in a special movement card and a special power for each player.  Money may feel a bit tight in the early round or two, but rarely is it that bad.  If you're looking for a tight economic game, look elsewhere.

There isn't anything really wrong with Kings of Air & Steam, but to be honest there isn't much really all that "right" with it either. The game plays out smooth enough, and it does what it sets out to do, but it also doesn't really do anything that would drive me to want to play it again either. The game is pretty much a simple pick up and deliver game with some steampunky elements throw in for fun. The market system leaves a lot to be desired, but again it really is just an average game. I would play it again, but nothing about it really drives me to ever want to play it again.

From only a single 5 player game, this feels like it holds a good balance of depth, theme and duration.  Whilst we work out how to play to each King's strengths, it'll be difficult to work out a good score, but while we stated during the game that we were unsure who was leading, it felt clear in hindsight!
There's a clear divide in our group over who's happy with the planning aspect & the ability for opponents to really screw up your intent, so there's some polarisation going on.

It says a lot about this game that it has almost a thousand reviews and only a couple dozen are below a 5. It was strange to see so many "5" reviews that said the game was enjoyable, but nothing special. According to BGG rating, that is at least a 6 - "OK game. Some fun or challenge at least."

I have played this many times and it has been a lot of fun each time. Setup is pretty straightforward and the rules are not too complex (depot hopping your goods is the trickiest mechanism to explain). By the end of the first round of five, things are starting to gel and regrets can be corrected somewhat. I love it when a blimp starts drifting toward a resource someone else has their eyes on... and then out comes the table talk [trash talk] =)

Pros:
* Supports up to 7p without too much downtime (turns are quick, and there is a simultaneous programming phase every 4 turns).
* High level of player interaction w/ mini-races to factories to pick up resources. Forces you to change your plans frequently.
* Variable player powers. They are mostly balanced, but there is one that is notably better. Designer fixed this in reprint (just remove 2 tokens from the DaVinci pilots for original)
* Random placement and market increases can allow new players to win, even against a seasoned player. This is great! Nobody likes to play with a strategic genius if she always wins before the game starts.

Cons:
* Subject to analysis paralysis. Don't play this with players who want to think the entire game through on their first turn. And second. And third...
* Market is very simplistic. It only goes up. That said, it is unpredictable and tends to shift what people do from turn 1, causing fun player interaction.
* Blimps are just too big. I don't know what they were thinking. =)
* It is easy for people to stay in the spot they picked at the start and not expand. The World's Fair expansion should alleviate this issue with "Contracts", giving extra VP for expanding outward and collecting all the resources.

7 players!  Synchronous planning is nice for quickness of play, but also this mechanic makes for the most hilarious entertainment as you forget what your plans were, or someone did the exact thing that screws them up and you have to come up with something on the fly.  At the same time, with careful planning and deduction on what others are doing, you can plan around this.  Would definitely be the most interesting make-money game I've seen, and has the incredible art and flavor from TMG I love.  It also has a team variant and extra powers, which would change the game!

Traded for with Mage Wars and accessories on here.

Traded away at Origins'16 Math Trade. Got my fill of it, especially with it providing play for more than 4 or 5 players. Figured I'd let it go to someone who could love it further, and see what else I could try out.

Pickup and deliver minus the route-building. Movement is programmed out 4 turns at a time. The need to be flexible is there because if someone throws a wrench into your plans well, your movement is still mapped out. 

The unique ships and, to a greater degree, pilots give the game some good replayability, and it scales from 2-7 pretty well (though the downtime for 7 can be a bit offputting). All in all, a pretty good game.

I've played KoA&S with 2 and 6 players multiple times, mostly using the basic version (e.g., without the different characters) because we've usually had at least one person who hasn't played before.  Play time seems perfect - capping the game at 5 rounds instead of a set dollar amount or number of victory points means that it doesn't drag on.  Also, using victory points instead of dollars earned means different strategies are useable depending on your situation.  

My only complaints are that the box is just a bit too small - everything fits, but pieces have to be put back in a fairly specific way - the plastic pieces are just a touch too large (80-90% of the current size would have been better I think), and the sharp corners of the cardboard pieces may eventually fray. None of these are reasons not to get the game, I would definitely buy it again.

Air ships, pick-up and deliver, variable player powers, trains, and building of powers are all things I enjoy.  

In the one game I had played, because of the turn order mechanic, I was able to get most expensive goods before anyone else.  At the end of the game my air ship was fully upgraded and frankly, I was bored with nothing to strive for to improve.  

I admit it was only one play, and perhaps my opponents might be more challenging with a second play, however, the game really fell flat for me.

It really is quite like Age of Steam / Railroad Tycoon, except that there's another system added that requires you to go retrieve cubes from a production site using your zeppelin and shift them to your rail link. Once there, it's much the same - spend actions to build rail links, build up your engine so you can run cubes over your links (or pay to use someone else's), and then run the cubes to their home city. Except income is per cube and rises through the game, rather than getting income per link crossed. The zeppelin movement makes the game though - you have to program exactly how many spaces it'll move on each of the 4 turns in a round, Robo Rally style, trying to take into account what other people will be going for, beating them to the cubes they want. Which can be horrible in a nicely competitive way - in effect the race for cubes is hotted up and the competition to build rail is cooled down in comparison to its predecessors. I really liked this version, and really liked that the game can be made cutthroat or efficiency-based based on the size of the map you build.

Very Cool Train Game which has actually 2 different transportation systems going at the same time. Tracks are already laid on the large map boards. Good production from TMG.

Not a gateway game.

The blimp pieces are cool, but almost too big. I think I would prefer the board pieces to be a little bigger.

Excellent, thick components and art. 

Mechanics are lite PROGRAM MOVEMENT for the airships, PICK UP and DELIVER plus ROUTE BUILDING to transport goods (via Airship) from factories to rail stations, then to cities (trains). A little SPECULATION in there too, gambling on whether replacement goods tiles are going to show up when/where you need them.

Also, variants (not tried yet) add VARIABLE PLAYER POWERS. The guy that taught this to me said he often plays those once people have a play or two, so I will definitely try them eventually.

Easy to teach. 2P plays under an hour. I played a 7(!) player game at a con and it took almost 3 hours. Scores were pretty tight at the end, too. 7P is probably never going to be my preferred way to play (probably 2-5), but it DID play very well with 7. You will need a HUGE table for a 7P game.

*Besides being just an all around game on its own accord, I think this might be a very good stepping stone to bring people into Age of Steam.

This game involves picking up goods from fields with a dirigible, dropping them off at stations on a pre-printed rail network, and then delivering them to cities that need those goods.  I liked the theme and mechanics, but didn't feel that the game was that compelling.  The game was more tactical than strategic, as you weren't building up a network to optimize things, you were just moving your blimp around and utilizing a network that already existed.  Made me wish I was playing Age of Steam.

Felt very much like Steam which actually tripped me up rulewise. I enjoyed it, but nothing in particular stood out to me. I did like the individualized pilots, but the rest was pretty standard fare. I'd play it again, but I think 2, 4, or 6 players might be the ideal way to play.

Gameboard was pretty and the demand for goods was a bit bizarre. Didn't really feel like a market. I would have loved to have them rise and fall based on the people delivering goods.

Beautifully produced game with interesting mechanics and I really like the theme. It´s somewhat chaotic in nature thanks to Roborally style programming and character special abilities are not balanced. And unlike in Roborally once your plans are blown up you will not catch up anymore.

RATING: 6.5
Many physical elements of the game are disappointing or active hindrances to gameplay: the too-large blimps, the similar coloring on black/purple, the similar coloring on paper/gold cities, etc. Game has a weird demand system that doesn't seem fully fleshed out. There is also an odd disconnect between your blimp flying around and your train getting goods. I'm not quite sure why they went for pre-turn programming here, either. Behind all this is a decent pickup-and-deliver game.

RATING: 7
It's basically a pick-up-and-delivery game. The picking-up is a bit more complicated then normally because you have to land exactly on the factory and you do this by playing cards from whom some have diamonds on them and you can't play more diamonds then your limit or you lose that turn.

De delivery is in fact a 2-step delivery: first your zeppelin has to deliver from the factory to a depot of yours (which ain't that hard as you can build them anywere (as long as you have the money)) and then you have to use your train to deliver the goods from your depot to a city who wants that good. This last part feels very similar to the mechanism used in Railroad Tycoon/Railways of the World.

+ Lots of material: After punching out all parts I can barely close my box
+ All works together fine
- Rather high price (in Europe)
- There are 3 configurations in the rulebook: 2-3 players, 3-5 players and 6-7 players. With less then the maximum number of each configuration, there won't be  much interference between the players. We played with 4 and certainly in the beginning of the game everybody stayed more or less in 'his/her' corner of the board.
- Playing time: almost 2 hours for 4 (all new) players I found a bit too long. 90 minutes would have been excellent.

Really nice components, however the zepplin minis are too big (they don't really fit in the hexes), which is a bit of a strange mistake for the publisher to have made. A fine economic pick up and deliver game. Not too light, not too complex, and not too long -- just right!

a very fun, quick playing steam slash pickup and deliver game. The way the game plays, you get this stupidly large blimp that you use to get to the factories on the board, then you sail them (using special movement rules that make it hard to make quick turns) to depots on rail lines you've built, and from there it acts like Steam or Age of Steam where you ship the goods along your tracks and other people's tracks (although in this game the tracks are all printed board features, so really your tracks just mean you've built a depot on them).

The major issue here is while it's a solidly built game when doing regular mode without factions, a lot of the fun comes out of exploring the abilities of the factions, so not playing with the factions seems a bit more dull, since the game is mechanically simple, but playing WITH the factions seems to introduce some balance issues.

Great artwork and detail on everything, but the airships are a bit much, since they take up so much space on the board, especially when you've also got it on the same space as a depot full of goods. It also has a tendency to block the view of depots, etc.
Fantastic game, otherwise.

Was a better pick up and deliver game than I expected. I liked how everything was based on one currency rather than juggling different ones, the deliveries have to be stages since you have two networks. The airship movement is programmed with not only how much but also to insure you get the right turn order.
Early impression is favorable for a mid-weight network building and pick up and deliver game.

There's a lot to like here, but the whole ends up being less than the sum of its parts.

Pros:
* I like the modular game board and the mechanic for changing the products demanded by cities.
* It's not too long (though this is a double-edged sword, as in some ways it feels like the game ends when people are just getting started.)  But at least you don't have the problem of players who find themselves in a hopeless position, but who have to keep playing for hours anyway.

Cons:
* The airships, as many have noted, are just too darn big.  They should really be about 1/3 the current size.
* Some of the mechanics get really fiddly, especially the ones that should be simple.  Actually shipping goods to a city requires a large number of preliminary steps.  You have to spend a valuable action for each step: pick up the goods from a factory, travel with them to a depot (oh, and you might need to spend a turn building said depot), drop them off, then actually ship them... but you might need to spend an action upgrading your rail network to be able to reach the destination, too....
* A few poor production design choices, like the gold, tan, and brown cubes (and corresponding cities) being somewhat difficult to tell apart, especially in less-than-ideal lighting.
* The downside of it being a fairly quick game is that one small mistake in planning can potentially cost you the game. 
* A few really odd scoring choices.  The *general* rule is "Finish with the most cash," but owning depots at the end of the game gives you an extremely large and counter-intuitive VP bonus at the end, to the point that victory seems to require building tons of depots, whether you need them or not.  With some planning, it's possible to make good *revenue* using only a few depots... but it's a loser's strategy due to the VP rule.

It's not a terrible game.  I enjoyed playing it, and I think a little more playtesting and design work might make it better.  But as it stands, there are better options out there for whatever itch you might be looking to scratch with this game.

This was better than I expected, especially since I don't care for pick-up and deliver games, but I love that it can go up to high player counts without getting bogged down too much, even though the factions aren't created totally equal.

An enjoyable pick-up-and-deliver game. Perhaps a bit tactical and opportunistic for my taste; there doesn't seem to be a lot of room for long-term strategy. It is also a bit chaotic because of the simultaneous move selection and the way in which move order is determined. Nevertheless there is much to think about, play is not scripted, and the little plastic airships are cool.

Very tactical pick-up and deliver game with a lighter version of the Robo Rally programming mechanism. In my first and only play I was a bit disappointed by the different player powers, because they seemed not well balanced and especially that one player could steal money and ressources from others (without any counter) made me not enjoy the game too much (I would rate this play a 5, but I believe I would have more fun in future plays).

I find this to be a somewhat enjoyable game enjoyable game, in which some quite interesting mechanics add a fair bit more to what is essentially a straightforward pick-up-and-deliver game. Yet it's not a game I would ever choose to play, or often even choose over other games of similar weight. 

My only real complaint is that the airship figures, although looking remarkably good, are far too big for the hexes of the board when they frequently share a hex with a depot and/or several cubes. And the friend who owns the game said that when he played it with 7 players it did not work well at all, and I can well imagine why. I have played with 4 and 3 so far, and I imagine it would also be good with 5 - with more I would have my doubts.

Note that we have not yet used the special abilities. I'm sure we will use them at some point, even though we don't play this game very often. It's a game I'll not usually be unhappy to play, but I'm not enthralled by it either.

I love Railways of the World and was certain I would love this too - but I didn't, and here is why:

1. It is still too much like Railways of the World. The planned movement of the airships didn't grab me like I thought it would. It was pretty hard planning 4 turns in advance and really it felt more like work than play.

2. Too "thinky" and caused AP at times, turns went slow sometimes too.

3. The airships are way too big for the game. I don't know what they were thinking. Cool pieces for sure but not functional at all.

4. Board looked too crowded most of the game, it was difficult to look at and plan for your move.

5. The tan and gold cities are too close in color which added to the difficulty of planning.

I had such high hopes for this, I was sure we were going to love it. I even read the rules before buying. Sometimes you just can't tell until you play. I can see where some might really like this, it just wasn't for me.

Rating based on just one play so far, but this game was a complete hoot.  Very much looking forward to going after this one again.

I complain about "euro" but when it works it's really wonderful gaming.  This one worked in spades, and we cracked the plastic, read the rules, set it up, and knocked out a game, enjoying the entire discovery process together.  [b]Very well written rules got us on the board in short order[/b] and it was just a great big bucket of fun to learn and to play.  

I like this kind of session, where everyone shares in the entire learning process, experiencing the game soup to nuts as a group instead of having someone present it in a vain attempt to "speed up" gaming.  I don't want sped up up gaming, I want enjoyment and fellowship, and this game brought it.

We played four players, but it goes to seven and that's how I want to play it next.  I don't fret over downtime as much as most and seven players on seven tiles should make for one seriously tight play with plenty of contention.  Besides, by turn three we were damn near taking simultaneous turns anyway.

And seven players means I can play this instead of [i]7 Wonders[/i], a game I hope to never ever ever ever ever ever play again.

Ever.

The art style of this game is incredible and is just overflowing with personality. I generally avoid steam punk anything and everything, but the airship thing really works for this game. The plastic airships feel really unnecessary for me and make the game tough to get back in the box, but that's a minor complaint. This game is fun, if a little on the long side. I like the way the economy works and the factions feel unique and interesting. I'd enjoy more plays of this game.

I'm not usually a fan of pick up and deliver games, but this one with its five short burst of preplanned movement does the job well. The race to certain goods and depots and advancing your technology is fun, albeit one of planning option A and then option B and with an option C if that doesn't work out. There's lots of enjoyable player interaction here folks. There will be cursing.

Very happy to explore more and the TMG components are more than up to their recent top notch standard.

While the character abilities will greatly assist with replayability my main concern is that the character abilities are not fairly balanced. It's a nice idea to be able to choose between two different characters for a colour, but some abilities seemed perhaps a little stronger than others. (Additionally, the blue double card choice seemed to add too much chaos to a game that already has a healthy dose of chaos.) 

As a very minor gripe I didn't like the fiddliness of having to point your airship in a certain direction at the end of a round. I understand the need to keep to 60 degree turns in flight, but beginning of the round resetting of the direction would have simplified things a bit.

I can't exactly express why I didn't enjoy this game, but I didn't. Everything worked fine mechanically, I'm not sure it "fits" together as well as it works, but the only design problem I had was the special powers were at very different levels.

Physically, I couldn't stand playing the game. The over-sized ships obstructed the board, there is dark purple and black player pieces, and two of the cube colours were close too. The spaces on the board could often be over crowded wit pieces.

I just don't think I was too keen on the air ship part of this game, somehow it felt tacked on (or maybe unneeded), however the airship programming was the bulk of the gameplay decisions, so it's tough to say.

This game scratches that train game itch in 90 minutes - not an easy thing to do.  Not sure if the characters are overpowered and the market board mechanic seems like it could use some adjustment as I don't think I like that the prices cannot decrease regardless of deliveries.

Still, it's fun, looks beautiful on the table and can lead to some pretty funny situations when you get beaten for a particular resource.  A solid game that I thought was going straight to the sale pile on first glance, but looks like it will be hanging around.

2 3er games. Cutthroat variant (basic game): a bit too small board? Regular version (normal game): WAY too open, with very little interaction.

This is a pretty straightforward pick-up-and-deliver game, on the lighter end of the scale. The twists are that there are 2 modes of transportation (air and steam), and the price for goods steadily increase but in an unpredictable sequence. I wouldn't mind playing this again, especially with the advanced variant (characters with special powers) and maybe with more people.

Update: really don't like this with 3 players! On either board configuration, it seems initial market values can be really swingy, with potential for luck if you happen to start near something that goes up in value quickly.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is constructed from a number of large hexagonal tiles (varies with player count and desired board tightness) and a number of connector/edge pieces, all covered with a hex grid of terrain, tracks, factories, and cities. Factories will produce a specific color of good, the prices of which are shown on a sideboard (all start at minimum price and gradually increase during game; on final turn, all at maximum price). Goods are placed on all factories on the board. Cities each demand a specific type and number of goods.

Players each get:
- a set of tokens in their color
- a matching set of movement cards (some with diamonds on them)
- money
- a personal board showing tracks for the distance their airships can move, airship cargo capacity, the number of links goods can be moved by train, and their diamond limit (limit on the number of diamonds they may use each turn). Each of these can be improved during the game.
- choose random start player

[b]Round Summary[/b]
[u]1. New Market[/u]: draw 3 market tiles, increase prices of those goods by $1
[u]2. Plan Airship Movement[/u]: players simultaneously select 4 of their movement cards and place them face down. These show a letter (turns will be taken in alphabetical order), a number (hexes to move), and 0-2 diamonds.
[u]3. Move & Action (x4)[/u]: players reveal their next movement card. In order based on card (alpha; ties broken by turn order), take your turn:

[i]Your Turn[/i]
In order (complete each step then move to the next):
1. [i]Check Diamonds[/i]: if your diamond limit exceeded, END TURN IMMEDIATELY.
2. [i]Movement [/i](Airship):
- use ALL movement on card
- may start with any facing, then turn 30 degrees each step
- may not end on city, partial hexes on edge, or space with another player's airship
- AFTER moving, may load cubes to/from factory/depot and airship (blimp has cargo limit)
3. [i]Action[/i]: 
- Build Depot: $4 for first on that link; $7 for second; 2 max per link
- Upgrade Airship: pay $ shown on your board; improves diamond limit and cargo capacity
- Upgrade Train: pay $ shown on your board; improves train link level
- Ship Good(s): 
... move any number of ONE TYPE of good from one of your depots to another depot or city demanding good; collect market price per good
... every link must have at least one depot; if any other players' depots on link, pay each depot $1 per good (after receiving your cash)
... number of links limited by train link level
... place cube on city marker; when spaces filled, draw random Demand Tile and place on the city; if Demand Tile filled, flip tile over - city closed
- Route Adjustment: move airship 1 space in any direction
- Solicit Funds: take $3 from bank
4. [i]Slide Card [/i] under player board, leaving only diamond showing

[u]4. Upkeep[/u]
- pay $1 per cube in all depots and your cargo
- pass Start Player marker to left

[u]5. Production[/u]
- factories produce 1 good each, plus 1 bonus good for the 3 tiles in the Market
- remove Market Tiles, place face down and shuffle; these are now Demand Tiles

END OF GAME
After 5 rounds, players may sell all goods still in depots at minimum ($4) price. Then score VP:
- 1VP per $1
- 10VP per built depot
- 15VP if airship at level 6
- 5/15/30VP if train link level is 4/5/6
Most VP wins! Tiebreaker = money.

I've never been terribly interested in the big, complex pick up and deliver games like Age of Steam.  I have a couple myself (Merchant of Venus and Merchants and Marauders) but haven't gotten them to the table yet because of their length.  Those are more my speed though, a little less dry with some other stuff going on.

To that end I quite enjoyed Kings of Air and Steam, probably one of the first true pick up and deliver games I've played.  This one is certainly not dry, it's bright and colorful with goofy artwork and variable player powers and stats.

This game is a pick up and deliver game streamlined I would guess.  It played in under 2 hours and that's including set up and explanation.  Players fly around the board in an air ship picking up and...wait for it...delivering goods from factories to depots which then get shipped to cities for money (points).

Between all this picking up and delivering of goods you can take a number of actions each turn such as upgrading your airship and rails, building new depots, shipping to cities, extra movement or simply taking some cash from the bank.  The variable player powers may also make a unique ability available to you.  The goal is like any other pick up and deliver game, make the most efficient economic engine to end with the most money.  Points are also achieved through upgrading your airship, rails, and building depots.

This was just the right weight for me.  While I enjoy complex games I'm not sure if I'm really having fun when I play them or I just revel the ability to overcome challenges.  This was certainly light enough to be fun but heavy enough to be deep and present interesting decisions.  I especially like the RoboRally style movement mechanic that presents some of the only interaction in the game being that you can beat another player to picking up goods from a factory or shipping to a particular city you are both after.

That's probably one of the only faults I find in the game is there is very little interaction with other players and I tend to get bored with solo-style game experiences after enough plays.  But there is still enough here that that didn't happen.  I should also point out that the production quality is phenomenal.  Pieces are sturdy and colorful, the airships are neat looking plastic miniatures (perhaps too big for the board and everything else that needs to fit on spaces) and the artwork is attractive and fun.

This is an all-round exceptional game: from the game play to the production values, very little is left to be desired.  The way in which all the moving parts work together can be a little confusing to new players, but as with most games, it's not as complex as might be thought at first glance.  Josh Cappel did a stellar job with the artwork, and the plastic airships are almost too good since their bulk tends to obscure parts of the game board.  The variable setup provides both excellent scaling from 2-7 players and a different map layout for each game.  Something doesn't seem 100% right about the scoring system (though I can't quite put my finger on it), but as a fan of "pick up and deliver" games, I'm exceptionally pleased with this one.  I don't even mind the fact that the individual character powers can be rather imbalanced, since this provides both a challenge and a built-in way to handicap more experienced players when playing with first-time players.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Bizarrely-themed pick-up-and-deliver game where players must collect factory goods in airships, then deliver those goods to depots to be shipped along the otherwise excellent rail network.

Airship movement is via RoboRally-style programmed movement. That this can really screw people over might be OK if it didn't feel so unfair due to wildly unbalanced player decks and luck of the production draw. 

Note that this comment is after 1 play on the "3p cutthroat" map, where resources were very tight and verything was close together (minimal benefit to upgrading trains or flying long distances). 4 players on the 5-tile board will probably be better. I'm a little skeptical it will be better enough.

Smart design, fun game with lots of replayability thanks to varied player powers, board setup, and market. Nice components, but the airships are a bit big. I enjoy pick up and deliver, and this is a nice take on that idea.
Sold May 2016 - never gets to the table, and the Wallace rail games are better.

Light and quick pick up and deliver.  It worked for me, I may be biased as I wanted to like it going in.  Nothing overly innovative, but nothing that didn't fit neither.  I liked planning the entire round (4 turns) and having to adjust during the round to what you had already selected.  Makes for a good mixture of Strategy and Tactics.  Would play again, not sure I would buy on my own.

Interesting pick up and deliver, with a dual delivery system; you need to take goods via your airship from production points, than drop them off at your rail stations. Neat planning and maneuvering rules. Really enjoy the gameplay. Dislike the imbalance of some characters.

tl;dr: good pick-up-and-deliver

Pick-up-and-deliver games have been a bit hit and miss with me, but I'm always open to trying new ones. This one had been on my list for years and I finally got to remove it.
This game combines a number of tried and tested mechanisms and combines them in a somewhat different way. You're both flying around with your airship and building a train network like you would in an 18xx game. It's a bit of a weird combination. But it works very well.
It's not a short game but it doesn't overstay it's welcome. It offers enough depth to keep you engaged for the entire play time.
I quite enjoyed this and would be happy to play it again. But it doesn't set my world on fire.

RATING: 4.5
It was so much fun we abandoned it.

The powers seem unsurprisingly imbalanced. The pirate power is amazing if no-one sees it coming. Therefore, I can't see it ever being of use in a second game.

The differing abilities of the airships means that, without memorising all of the cards, you can't really even account for where an opponent might go/be able to go and so the pick up (if not the deliver) descends into so much randomness.

Also, the airships themselves only serve to block the board and make it, for the most part, not fit for purpose. Having three airships in the same space was a fucking joke since 2 don't really fit.

As a pick up and deliver game, it's mediocre. With all the stupid shit added, it's poor.

Perhaps an additional play will highlight hidden depths and smooth over the rough edges. I'm just not sure we'll be able to talk anyone into a second play.

RATING: 7
A good and fresh implementation of the pick up and deliver theme.  Some tough choices, and the game rewards long term planning (more than just individual turns).  

I suspect the different player powers could do with a touch of rebalancing, but doesn't detract from a fun game.

Man! I'm really enjoying this! What a blessed union the marriage of programmed movement with pick-up and deliver is! Just the right amount of planning, strategizing, tactical manouvering and back-peddling, with out being too heavy. Just fantastic. Love it!

I'm not sure about the balance between player powers at this stage and the airships could be smaller and the box a little bigger, but those small issues certainly aren't game breaking!

Reasonably fun pick-up-and-deliver game.  But I don't think six is an optimal number.  There's too much activity and too many scoring mechanics to track other players relative performance, so after a long game into which I put a lot of thought I have no idea effect my actions had or what I could have done to score more - for all I know it could be random.  Probably wouldn't play again if there were alternatives at the table.

Kings of Air and Steam is a solid pick up and deliver game. The variable player abilities do a great job keeping things fresh, and the changing market keeps you on your toes. My only qualm is for a programmed movement game, you rarely get interfered with by other players at lower player counts.

RATING: 7
I've played Steam and Railways of the World, and while those games are okay, they're definitely not fun. Kings of Air and Steam basically lifts everything from those games, removes some of the grueling aspects, and adds in a good amount of fun.

You've got cartoony artwork and big airships, aymmetrical player powers, and a streamlined game that is just fun to play. There are no auctions or loans here, and no jockeying to get the action you really need. You just "program" your next four moves by playing four cards, and after each card you can take one action. The actions let you upgrade your stuff, ship goods, or reposition your airship if you've planned badly.

The airships themselves are actually too big, though. They sometimes need to be in a space along with other airships, cubes, and other wooden bits. I've replaced them with meeples so that everything can fit easier.

Really fun, and possibly the best pick-up-and-deliver game that I've played.

[b]Player Count Verdict: All[/b]
Because the board scales based on the number of players, it really seems like this would work equally as well with all player counts. There would be slightly more competition to try to get to areas first with more players, but that seems to depend on playstyle and character choice as well as how the market develops.

2/22/13 - Got this to the table for a 5 player game. It was relatively easy to explain and the flow of the game went pretty smoothly. Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit and I look forward to my next play. I enjoyed the programmed movement, but also appreciate that you can change plans reasonably well if another player scoops you. The art is fantastic.

In addition to the late delivery, there are some production issues. As other people have said, the ships are too big. The tiles are warped, so they don't rest well on the table, causing them to spin and separately from the other tiles. While most games have way more room in the box than is necessary, this game has the opposite problem. It's really difficult to squeeze it all in. Despite this being a good game, I feel like TMG dropped the ball on this one, which is disappointing as I'm a fan of their company and owner.

2/11/13 - Received from Kickstarted. Finally.

Pros: Nice card selection mechanism for having some control over turn order. Diminished demand system works well. Airship movement sytem feels like it has just the right amount of restriction. Prices and VP values seem right. Gorgeous components.

Cons: Airships are cool but too big in that they cover the entire factory symbol and can't practically fit into a space with another ship. Simultaneous action selection is better than most with that mechanism, but it still remains one of my least favorites. Some parts of the map and some character powers are just better than others.

7 is not a bad rating, but my expectations after waiting fifteen months was a bit higher. Opinion may change with more playings.

Such a smart concept to require an airship to pick up the goods from the factory and move them to your depots and from there trains to move them to the cities! Also very refreshing mechanism on the availability and production of new goods. High quality components. The base game is great. The use of special houses with special powers adds some complexity that some people would like ... I tend to like the base game more.
If you like games like Railroad Tycoon, this game is for you!!! Recommended!

This game is just another pick-up-and-deliver game.  There was little to set it apart from other p-u-a-d's other than the special player powers which were somewhat unbalanced.  I would have rather played a better game of the genre instead of this.  

There's nothing horrible here, but there's nothing particularly great either.  Afterwards we sat around trying to figure out why nobody really liked it.  The comment that really hit home with me was "It just wasn't fun."  It was just a mechanical process of converting cubes to points, something which I don't oppose on principal, with absolutely no joy in it.  It kinda feels like a copycat sitcom... one of the ones that follows the form but lacks any actual humor.

I've really enjoyed this game so far. I like the added dimension of the airship to the long standing train game mechanic of shipping goods to cities. I also like the program of your airship movement over 4 turns each round aka Robo Rally. The steampunk theme fits well, especially with the character cards and factions, which give each player a slightly different variant mech. This game will get a lot more plays for sure!

I'm not sure the special abilities of the character cards in line with their turn order are at all equal. Some characters are much easier to score high with. How much was this game playtested? It's still fun to play, but not fair by a long shot!

Not sure if it is worth the price I had to pay for it in The Netherlands (56 euros), but if you like logistics games with preprogrammed movement, there is enough to recommend here. The variable player powers add flavour and the board looks very nice when set up. Replaced Himalaya in my collection, because I did not like the "need a majority to score" mechanic of that one.

RATING: 6
In the advance game, Kings of Air and Steam succeeds in meshing the steampunk theme into the game play. Each player controls a unique airship and pilot with special abilities. These unique rules allow players to feel more specialize and thus, enhance the steampunk "feel" to game play. Without the advance ruleset, it becomes a straightforward pick-up and deliver game, or rather a pick-up and deliver-and-deliver game. The unique twist to this game is the two stage delivery system where goods picked up by the airships at distinct locales have to be transported to depots where trains then shuttle them to cities. So, route planning not only consists of piloting airships to the proper destination via a pre-programmed flight-path, but also making sure that individual depot networks extend far enough to accommodate shipment of goods to cities. In essence, Kings of Air and Steam has successfully intertwined multiple mechanisms found in various games (route building and pay per use track network; pickup and deliver; roborally-esque preprogram flight path). The length of the game feels just about right. Now for the negatives: the game can have a solitaire feel to it. Players chug along to pick up and deliver goods without too much of a fight most of the time. Fighting for goods in a 4 player game was not terribly intense. Money is not a bottleneck. There are loads of money to be made and hence, made upgrading relatively easy (depots/airships/tracks). The individual player powers can be a little unbalanced (the gambler is weak, the extra action robot is powerful). I am also a little concerned by the luck associated with regenerating demand in cities. If the supply happens to be close to the demand late in the game, you can certainly cash in.
Overall, Kings of Air and Steam is a good game. Ultimately, I commend the author's effort to incorporate multiple mechanics into the game.

kings of air and steam - 
combines steam with pickup and deliver. rather than building tracks, you have a zeppelin you move around the board
to pickup resources from factories. then drop them off at player built houses. and then ship them to cities using parasitic scoring like steam
once demand filled in a city then it swithces to diff demand.
can upgrade movement, shipping, new building etc
advanced version have variable player powers

Excellent game! I translate the rules in french so I can remember and teach the game easily. I really like the fact that this game may be playable from 2 to 7 players. The only negative point is the size of the airships. They are a little bit too big for the hex when we move them with a depot and goods or onto the same hex with another airship. Otherwise, they look really good on the board.

Tired of the usual pick-up and deliver games surrounding just railroads?  Add a bit of variety with this one by throwing in blimps as well.

This game is a great collection of so many different aspects that I really enjoy in games:  modular boards, variable player abilities, pre-programmed movement [i](RoboRally-style)[/i], beautiful production values, lots of options each turn [i](without being overwhelmed with choices)[/i], pick up & deliver, and a good level of player interaction without being too back-stabby.  It even supports a huge range of players, so it'll work with almost any group.

Steampunk as a game theme is something I'm generally neutral towards; it's not one I actively seek out but I would never turn down a game because of it either.  It fits and works really well here without being overbearing, so there's no complaints there.

Players with AP issues can slow things down a bit, especially in a crowded game because there is a lot of planning to do, but downtime between turns is still lower than in many other games because the programming is simultaneous and the order that movements and actions occur varies every turn.

Overall this is a fantastic game that I just wish I could play more often.

RATING: 1
Easy to teach, plays fast (don't know about 7p yet but will soon) and play 7p.
For those big groups who are just tired of Werewolf and Avalon... Lol

Okay 5p done tonight (2 hours with some AP and teaching 3 new players) and it is still a 9 (leaning toward a 10). Will have to wait for team powers to be added in our games. A couple of the teams do seem overly powerful but it is a wait and see approach.

For example The Emperor team has the No Move +1 action movement card. That couple with Reginald Kain's ability of having $20 at the start.
 
So technically you could upgrade you blimp with your first Move/Action (to get the 1 diamond needed to play the No Move +1 action card). On the 2nd move have already planed to play the No Move card and upgrade your blimp 2 times with both actions.
So beginning of your 3rd Move/Action you have a level 3 blimp and $11 left.

Furthermore with the $11 you could do the action from Move #3 and Move #4 to upgrade you blimp the final 2 levels to have an automatic 15Vp and a fully upgraded blimp at the end of the first round... sounds pretty powerful to me.

It is up for trade but I have very little interest in trading unless it is a 2 for 1 or better.
Only will consider offers from my Wishlist(1).

UPDATE- 10/13
Found out is is just a math problem and once it is solved just make the market play 5 rounds of that and then count money... no board or player-pieces required.
Really sad this was not playtested more since solving the math basically broke the game.
Down rated to a 3 from a 9.
Message me if you want to know what math was solved or if someone actually runs a tournament and you want a guaranteed win.

FINAL UPDATE- 09/18 
Down rated from a 3 to a 1 because of my posts being deleted.
Seems my initial forum posts have been deleted and the culprit, I can only assume, are friends of Octavian (Viva la revolución). The designer has ignored my geekmails as well. So this is broken. Using the 2 and 3 cards and only fully upgrading your train and depots and never your blimp... try it
If you don't win the only difference would have been your first market item was not priced at $6 and the winner used this strategy and got the $6 first... top score is finite and should be around 230 to 250ish. Designer needs better playtesters.

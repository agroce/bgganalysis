GAME: WARS Trading Card Game
RANK: 4011
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After Decipher lost the Star Wars license, they made WARS TCG, a CCG that kept the essence of the gameplay of Star Wars CCG, but without the license. It plays similarly to SWCCG in its early sets, but with most sites focusing on a single planet, and with steamlined rules and a more balanced mix of cards.

WARS is awesome. Decipher learned some things about CCG mechanics from designing SWCCG, and WARS has some definite improvements. One drawback is (of course) that it's not Star Wars. But on the plus side, the problem of super rare mains that you NEED in order to have a good deck is gone. There are characters with proper names, but they usually only have power 1 and are not the type of card you want to make up a large part of your deck; the more common units usually represent entire squads and are more powerful in battle. The card sets and gameplay is similar to the early sets of SWCCG, but with some of the more interesting things from the later sets (like 'tutors', multiple battle destinies, the ability to 'stack the deck', and weapons that are actually good). There are also new interesting things, like cards that can be "inverted", with different stats or abilities in its inverted state, and cards that can add to the attrition afflicted in battle. There's also a special type of location, called "encampments", that may be placed as new locations, or underneath existing locations to make it more valuable.

The rules in WARS are also more streamlined than SWCCG. For example, there are no specific rules for docking bay transit; docking bay rules are simplified and stated right in the docking bay location text. All vehicles and ships are assumed to be piloted, and weapons' abilities are used like interrupts instead of having their own set of rules.

WARS is better than SWCCG for people who want to play with a draft format; it has 5 factions that all feel different, and you can use any cards in a single deck that you want. A card from a faction requires you to have one to three of that faction's locations on the board in order to play it, to prevent people from playing "5 color" decks without consequences. It sort of feels like they merged the 5 color thing from Magic into SWCCG. "[-]Mana[/-] location screw" shouldn't a problem because you can pick a good starting location that should let you place most of your units all by itself, and it's much easier to find a specific card in your deck than it is in Magic.

Best of all, WARS has very good artwork for a CCG, and it has an interesting backstory for a game not based on an existing fictional work. The main knocks against the game, as I see it, are the relatively steep learning curve and play time (almost an hour), which are both barriers to getting new people to play (which are also the same knocks against SWCCG). It's a cool game that I unfortunately haven't had opportunity to play very much.

In summary, it's cheap, draft-friendly, and a great game. You can pick up all 6 preconstructed decks, plus 2 booster boxes for $20.

Fixed a lot of the problems with the original game (the Star Wars CCG), but it didn't have a chance to get off the ground. A shame. The theme is decent enough, but it's no Star Wars.

Virtually identical but slightly better mechanical base than Star Wars and lacks the card and rules bloat. It's still not that good, though.

The mechanic of using cards as life means that whenever you take damage it is also limiting your card options, which is fundamentally awful. Two player games should avoid the death spiral.

Of all the "big name" ccgs and tcgs out there, I would have to say this is the only one that ties for first place with MTG. This game has beautiful balance and is very playable with just a single starter deck. Be warned though, it is one of the hardest ccg/tcgs to learn and play properly, but well worth the effort.

Feels, and really IS, a cleaned up version of the Star Wars CCG with a lot of the side-games removed.  You are playing, and you will interact with the other player, like it or not.  They did a good job with this one- wish it would've lasted longer.

This was a good game despite that Decipher ran it into the ground.  You can pick up booster boxes super-cheap these days, so it's a pretty good value.

Very possibly the deepest, most strategic CCG that will ever be released.  The mechanics are rock solid, and it's a lot of fun to play.

I had forgotten about this gem in my collection, it really does not get used at all, sadly, but has a nice home and I do get them out from time to time and threaten to teach the wife, again. She learned when I first got it, and played it with me it was precious and I really enjoyed the game. its not her genre' twice (fantasy sci fi, and CCG's) and yet she enjoyed it, I always like the look of the games cards, and the rules are refreshing. I need to finish my collection and then get serious about teaching her to play..again!

After playing about 8 times with the booster decks, 1 sealed draft game, and 3 constructed games, all i can say is WOW.
Really fun. Good tense strategic play, that isn't overly complicated. We had some timing/rules interpretation issues at first, but didnt take to long to find agreement with how the rules should work (a bit difficult as unfortunately there is no faq)
Cant wait to open more boosters, play more sealed and construct more decks!
Would have gotten a 9 if there were more sets :(
As it currently is, some choices are a little limited.

Folks, your disinterest in this _excellent_ game is stupefying...is it just because no one is trying it or because of the negative stigma attached to it being "Star Wars TCG redone" driving you away?  I despise CCGs, mainly because of that first C but this game is exemplary not only as a CCG but also a _game_.  I have never played a more mechanically balanced or more strategically rewarding CCG.   This is substantially beyond even the vaunted MTG in terms of depth.  I believe that the resource management component is extremely well done, the simulation of fighting on different fronts (in space and on planets) is brilliantly executed, and the balance is nearly perfect- even without rares or "power" cards.  I believe I'll be playing this for a long time to come and I'd love to see more players interested but if not, then I'll buy the boxes off the clearance tables at the con.  At least try it, OK?  Note: I've docked my rating a bit because I've seen the terrifying arrival of Mr. Suitcase into the game, which has stunted my interest in.  Mechanically, it's still great but ultimately it is a CCG.

RATING: 6
I was a big fan of Star Wars CCG, but towards the end, I did think the focus of the rules was lost for all the "special mechanics".  I was really hyped for Wars to come out, so Decipher could start with a clean and simple slate, and it definitely played cleaner from the start.  However, there are a number of things that I still don't think got really well worked out, and looking at the previews for the first expansion "Nowhere To Hide", it looks like perhaps Decipher hasn't learned their lesson yet -- and the game may be destined to spin off into an unmanageable, unbalanced combination of "the latest cards, the latest special rules".

Production: Attractive artwork, but sometimes at the expense of adding visual clutter to cards already too packed with information.  The sci-fi theme is fun, but does not engage me as readily as does that of the Star Wars CCG.  Play: This is a great test in the importance of theme.  Basically, all that has been changed between the Star Wars CCG and WARS TCG is the switch to original sci-fi characters, and the result makes it less fun for me.  Nonetheless, the central mechanism of conserving one's own deck while depleting that of one's opponent is still engaging, and succeeds in making the game fun, in spite of the usual array of rules-bending cards all too prevalent in trading card games.

simplified StarWars:CCG engine which looked promising at first, but the game wasn't deep enough and also its universe wasn't so captivating

RATING: 6
What really attracts me to this game is the full universe crafted around the WARS franchise. Decipher spent a great deal of time creating background details - short stories, artwork, even a soundtrack - for the game, and it really adds value for anyone willing to invest the time.

Of course, it also doesn't hurt that the WARS CCG also plays extremely well because it was based on a streamlined version of the well-established Star Wars CCG mechanisms.

My one complaint is the obscene rarity distribution, with Rare cards being incredibly hard to track down.  Luckily full boxes of boosters were sold for pennies on the dollar once the game was discontinued.

#5, 8, 115, 174, 222, 223, 294, 308

This is another incredibly well done CCG that shows just how bad Magic is.  The key improvement is having single cards have multiple roles.  Like games like the 40K card game, if a card is really powerful as a character, it is less powerful as a die roll.  You need that type of multiple level card to prevent the person with the most expensive collection of rares from simply winning.  The attrition-casualty system is then the high point that makes this game unique and worth playing.

Two precons opened, and a BIG box of commons/uncommons...more than enough to get anyone started.  Fun, strategic game--but a bit bland, and really suffers from missing the Star Wars license.  Plus, with such a limited pool before it was cancelled, it really is mostly battle, battle, battle with bits of tactical movement, a far cry from the rich gameplay fans of Star Wars CCG are used to.  EDIT:  Sending some of this away in "GeekChain of Generosity."  Dumping the rest at some point this week, it's been taking up room in my closet long enough!

Built on the Star Wars CCG engine, it has to be good, but they lost a lot in the theme-switch. Since it never got hold (partly due to poor support from the company it seems), it never grew on me.

RATING: 7
My initial reaction to this game is pretty positive.  The game is pretty streamlined, plays at a good pace, and there are some nice tactics involved.  There is definitely room for some interesting play in the game, and I rather like the artwork and card design.  I think the game stands up on it's own quite well, right out of the starter, so there isn't really any need to go on a collecting hunt.  It doesn't hurt that the game is so cheap and easily available.

It's a shame it failed.  It must have suffered from bad timing, and well, the name of the game is pretty darn generic and easy to forget.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a remarkably well designed game, very much a wargame in card format. I'm not entirely enthused about the support icon bit, the luck of the draw can easily ensure that many of your more powerful units, or even an entire faction, never see play. If it weren't for that, i'd rate it a 9.

This is basically like a second edition of the Star Wars CCG by decipher. Just by reading over the cards I felt like I already knew how to play, just had to read up on what changed. I loved a lot of the ideas around the Star Wars CCG mechanics, Wars just fixed a lot of the problems and made the overall functionality of the game better. Best of all the power balance between cards isn't as bad as it was in Star Wars. Still need to play more to give a better opinion about the game, but it's a much improved and overall better version of the Star Wars CCG just without the Star Wars setting.

This game is a bit longer than other card games I have played but it sucks you in and the time never feels like its that long.  The game mechanics are very good.  The rules took a bit to get down but made sense when play began.  I borrowed a lot from Star Wars and it will stay in my collection!

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

A nice tweak by Decipher of their Star Wars CCG game engine.

Sadly, one of the best selling points of THAT game was that it was Star Wars themed.  Wars isn't.  Thus, didn't grab the same amount of lime light or build as a big a fanbase.  I need to revisit this game.

Worth a look if you like CCGs and are a fan of the SciFi genre.

RATING: 7
Wars is the final iteration of Decipher's card-cycling, location-based CCG engine seen in previous licensed games. As such, its laser-focused on the strengths of the system which emphasizes unit placement and location control over crazy spells/direct attacks. 

Pros:
-Card cycling mechanic is fantastic. Basically your deck doubles as your health, hand & resources, finding an elegant solution to all three systems at once.

-Location/unit movement system is simplified and is strategically sound. Basically this is the best version of the venerable system released. The support icons are a great idea.

-The core combat & control mechanics just work. Solid A here.

-Card artwork & design is superb. This is a serious contender for the CCG with best artwork & layout.

Cons:
-Attrition-based victory condition. Basically unless players & decks are closely matched there is a common tendency for matches to develop serious attrition issues as there are several viable turtling strategies out there. Matches can drag on in those cases or be so one-sided that they are called off when its clear there's no turning back from a hopeless situation.

-Factions are rather derivative. You have essentially the default Earth guys, the nomadic space pirates, the space samurai, the token swarmer zerg/tyranid race and the token protoss/eldar race. Care to guess how each one plays?

-Star Wars CCG fans will probably miss the fact that the game focuses on nothing but combat (as the name should clue you in) and I feel having other mechanics that encouraged additional victory conditions would have knocked the attrition factor down somewhat. The canned expansion was supposed to add psyonics so maybe they were headed in that direction before closing shop.

Essentially a superb and good-looking if a bit single-minded card game. Give it a chance and you will be hooked.

A card game dedicated to conflict, as one might predict by the title.  Same basic system as the old Star Wars CCG, but strips out most of the side games, leaving only the conflict and control elements.  Easily the best CCG about fighting a war (as opposed to many which cover duels or skirmishes).  It's really too bad that Decipher nixed this one - or should I say, too bad that it never caught on? - because this may have been their best game (though not without its faults).  Though I suppose part of its superiority is due to the fact that it never had the chance to get bloated, like SWCCG.

Not really interested in this one until the boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk.  Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).  Looking to pay about "nn" cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer "nn" cents per/ in trade value if trading].  
nn = 16.  
Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 10:1 (10 WARS for 1 MtG).

Underrated. Excellent game system that feels more like a strategy game than a card game (like MTG). The art is generally of great quality and the overall design is rather strong.

I was looking through my card collection the other day and came across WARS. The cards are top notch - some of the best artwork that has been committed to cardboard. The gameplay is solid, being based on the Star Wars CCG. However, this game bombed when it was released which was a real shame.

I put my thoughts down here (http://www.spritelygames.com/blog/why-the-wars-tcg-failed/) about why a game with such promise died a premature death.

My rating is based on the card pool we were left with when the game was cancelled. If it was re-released today in an LCG format, it could be pushing a 9 or 10.

Decent CCG.  There are some aspects to it that I find appealing, but overall it doesn't do much for me--likely my anti-CCG bias showing through.  Even after one playthrough I still don't feel that I really have a firm grasp of the rules, which is unusual for me.

This is basically the same system as Decipher's Star Wars CCG game, but more streamlined and refined, making it a better game. It also plays well and is more satisfying right out of the starter decks because you're not looking for those flashy rare Luke, Han Solo, Vader and Millenium Falcon cards that were hard to find in the Star Wars CCG. But without the recognizable Star Wars vehicles and characters, this stood no chance of catching on. Wars plays pretty smoothly once you grok it, but is probably a bit long for what it is - it is, after all, a game of attrition where the goal is to drain away your opponent's energy, represented by their cards. So, to win, you need to "deck" the other player, to use a Magic term. It's a see-saw affair since you deploy then attack, meaning you throw down a bunch of vehicles, ships and characters then whack your opponent at his weak points. Then he does it back to you. The roller-coaster effect can be fun and interesting, but be prepared for a longer ride than the advertised 45 minutes.

This is the reboot of the Star Wars CCG without the licence. The game is solid and the illustrations are good for the most part. Back in the day it had some really clever mechanisms and it is still worth playing.

I know this is largely the Star Wars CCG repackaged without Star Wars, but I've never played the Star Wars one. The art is great. It's a bit confusing figuring out damage.

This *might* be the TCG that gets me back into TCGs.  I got some free starters from GenCon SoCal...tried it out for the first time and had a blast.  Resource management, hand managment, tactics, strategy...it's all here, wrapped into a single game.  If this game catches on, it has the potential to be BIG.

A great game that moves at a brisk pace and shows off some fantastic art. The theme is well done and evocative. About 10 minutes too long.

Although the Rules are quiet hard to understand when reading it the first time, it's a fast to learn game. Nice for a quick game but nothing to get really addicted to. The Artwork is pretty good.

A great take on the dudes on a map genre. The skyline is fun and ensures that turtleing is not a viable strategy, though if you roll REALLY poorly it can be very frustrating. Upgrading your cards is fun as well, and the game definitely doesn't overstay its welcome. While the elizabeth stories in the box are thematic (and the game as a whole is quite thematic and matches up to the video game quite well), I would be interested to see what someone could do creating an athematic story progression, because the way it works as it exists in the box, you don't get to see a ton of the story events usually.

As far as dudes-on-a-board games go, this isn't bad.
There's a few interesting design decisions that were made that keep the game engaging and exciting but overall I would say it's "Okay"
It's a GOOD game though. Honestly, if you are a fan of BioShock Infinite and are looking to break into the tabletop game hobby, I would say this could be a fun entry point. The complexity is just slightly above Risk, but with less random chance. It's still very Ameritrash though so there is tons of dice rolling. There's also the inclusion of Booker and Elizabeth which just feels tacked on and seems to just arbitrarily ruin a single player's day every time he moves.

Overall, there's other games of the genre I'd be more excited to play, but I can't see myself declining another game.

Unique, interesting take on Risk-like area control which simply oozes the theme of the Bioshock Infinite video game. However, players take on the roles of the Founders and Vox Populi, with Booker and Elizabeth as neutral parties that can get in the way. The voting, the skylines, the elegant but effective combat system, the beautiful components, and multi-use cardplay combine for a great experience, one that I only wish would be expanded further...alas...

2013. 2-4p. 60 min.  dice rolling, area control, betting/wagering, hand mgt, and partnerships.  Ameritrash... some have called it Risk on steroids w/steampunk theme... light area control and combat game with objectives... sounds like it's best with 2p, and the 4p game feels like an afterthought.

Despite being a game based on a popular IP, I actually quite enjoy this game.  The reason is that unlike many wargames (in which the goal is total domination, so the games take FOREVER), the goal is quite focused:  Victory points.  You can get these from area domination and/or completing tasks.  Add cards and hand management, and you get a pleasant little package.

This is a pretty good area control game.  It goes to great lengths to preventing a runway leader. It works well with the theme as players always dread using the skyway.  Speaking of the skyway, it is a neat mechanic but does make attacking opponents very difficult and really too risky of a proposition for a smart dug in foe.  Additionally, it is possible to win 10 victory points without any invasion of enemy Territory. I would have expected the victors would have needed to successful in battling one of the floating islands from their foe for the last victory point(s).

A surprisingly fun game that actually does something good with the well known franchise that is Bioshock. I was happy to learn about how the game wasn't so much about Booker and Elizabeth trying to escape the Columbia, but instead focusing on the two factions which resides within the city. Even better, the game is far from as complex as I thought it would be, considering what the game is based on, and I'm really happy with how everything works; from the outcome of battles to controlling locations and recruiting an army. A job well done by Plaid Hat Games for not putting too much effort into creating overly complex game mechanics.

Not to be played with more than 2 players, though. It's not worth the extra time.

One of the most interesting and immersive games I've played. Granted I am a huge fan of the video game, but usually I have trouble immersing myself in the theme of a game rather than the mechanics, and this game manages to capture the feel of Columbia and the conflict there perfectly.

The hand management gives the players a constant interesting choice that varies from turn to turn, and the combat is simple, but thematic. 

All in all, my current favourite game.

Traded Because: It is too random and can be punishing if you fall behind.

Area control game with pretty neat combat system. Upgrades are neat and card abilities enhance the experience. Moving to adjacent area on the zipline is a neat way to get around the board, though when forced to move to other areas using it, you will usually lose some of your forces.

Dec. 2016: Played this for the first time last month and haven't felt like bringing it back out. Maybe with a few more plays I will enjoy this more as I get accustomed to card abilities and available strategies.

This just in: Booker is a DICK!

Seriously, as a fan of the Video Game I was excited to play the Board Game, and I was NOT disappointed!
That being said, it provides a completely different perspective on the troubles in Columbia, and Booker's involvement...
That is, Booker just "drops in" with Elizabeth in tow, causes trouble, and then moves off elsewhere...
This is exactly how the Video Game plays as well, and it fits SO WELL... But you don't realize the trouble you're causing around Columbia (nor do you care) while playing the Video Game... When you're playing the Board Game, Booker is grief!

I LOVE IT!

Good old-fashioned 2-player Ameritrash wargame with a nice coating of chrome. Nexus Ops, War of the Ring, that sort of stuff. The rulebook has some pretty nasty holes, though, so keep the BGG Rules forum handy.

Mostly it works, although some elements can be very swingy. Movement itself is risky, which doesn't feel quite right in this kind of game. That makes it tough to come back once behind, as the leader can sit on a territorial VP advantage while both players compete for victory card VPs as they come into play.

Is it better or worse than other games of this genre? Yes.

The theme was spot on with the video game. Having played the game makes it 10x more enjoyable, and it's a pretty good game by itself too. For a war-like game there are so many choices to make. "Spend cards to vote? But I need to save them for money." "Move everyone to one space? But I need to roll Skyrail dice four times." This game got my blood boiling! Will play again, maybe next time with co-op!

UPDATE: First co-op game played and it was drawn out and not as exciting as 2p. My blood boiled in 2p while in 4p I sat and wondered if I could do more, since you get less units. Will try co-op one more time to see if it's still as dull.

Just couldn't really get into this game. There doesn't seem to be a lot of "focus" if I can call it that. You end up winning upgrades (sometimes multiple) almost every turn, often for units who you haven't even has to use the standard version of yet. Booker / Elizabeth moves are random and are almost sure to destroy whichever units are in the square they move to... etc.

Fun and exciting.  All the mechanics in this game work well and really seem unique and very thematic.  I can't think of a single game to compare this to.  At its heart its an area control game w/ randomized events and victory condition.  I love how the events progress the story and the victory conditions can suddenly speed up the game.  Overall an very interesting game that lacks something to really wow and excite.  Often used calculate out probably game which is usually a plus in a euro style game however this game being so thematic it seemed a little a natural to this even feeling a bit like cheating.

I wanted to like this one, I liked the game and Plaid Hat did well thematically with the game, but I find it too fiddly. It's all the upgrades. Just not my cup of tea. The factions and leaders didn't seem completely balanced, either. Others might feel differently though on this one.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this interesting and different area control game. Whilst the minis are quite small they are not oversized for the spaces on the board.

I like the Columbia events phase where you have to choose to add cards for influence, thus forfeiting them for future use as either money or all important combat bonuses.

The initially hidden resistance of areas is nice and gives bonus coins when the resistance of an area is defeated however the monetary gains are very large and this felt like a win more mechanic a little as more units meant better chance to win which meant more money to buy more units which increased you chances of winning.... but maybe this effect will lessen with more plays where combat is more tactical rather than sheer numbers.

The skyline mechanic is really nice as there is a risk in moving too far and I like that the Vox player has several abilities that improve their ability to use the skyline

The generals for your faction are a nice touch and with there being 4 for each faction will add replayability however I think the Comstock one giving +2 combat value to everything is very overpowered.

Combat is a simple affair rolling different dice based upon how elite the unit is. Booker is very scary and is essentially a death sentence to whichever units he happens to land upon.

a good reproduction on board of the classical videogame, specifically the third of the series. in the boardgame we will either pick the side of the founders of columbia, the capitalistic faction trying to mantain order trough money power and dicatorship sometimes or we will pick the side of vox populy, the communist and libertarian faction whic tryis to estabilish true democracy and riots to the oppression. In the meanwhile, Booker De Witt tryis to save Elizhabet escaping the city and eventually battling one or both of the factions. the game features even a 3 or 4 players variants but in my opinion this is a 1vs1 kind of boardgame

The game is fun to play and very thematic - and I say this without having ever played the videogame. It has some good ideas but feels underdeveloped. There is a lot of randomness and some crazy things happen. Bidding for event resolution and turn order may be too important, particularly when a victory point card whose condition can be easily fulfilled by both players is drawn. Also, you really need to know all the cards well to play properly, since you can upgrade them without having them in your hand, but their values and powers are only on the cards themselves.

The miniatures and board art are nice. I really like how the locations are depicted by their buildings instead of regions in a more traditional map, although blue borders on a mostly blue background were certainly not the best choice for easy visualization.

I must add that, after watching the tutorial video, I realized that the rulebook is much worse than I had imagined and completely ruined my first game.

RATING: 4
The theming is all over the place, ranging from broadly coherent to utterly nonexistent; but what really kills it is that the pacing and balance of the game are all over the place. Yes, in theory your card draws and the events should balance out--but given that you need them to intersect in various ways, one is left with the impression that the game is playing you rather than the other way around.

RATING: 5
Bioshock Infinite is a two-player (or team) light wargame themed around a videogame. Having never played the videogame, and knowing basically nothing about it, the theme was not a particular selling point for me. The box claimed a 60-90 minute playing time, but our first game ran almost 3 hours, not including setup and explanation.
 
The gameplay borrows heavily from games like Nexus Ops, with players buying units, moving them around to attack, and trying to be the first to score 10 victory points. These points are scored permanently by achieving various goals, or temporarily by holding territories. Each player gets a hand of 5 cards each turn which can be used as money to purchase units, an attack bonus, a special ability, or for voting. The voting happens at the start of each round with players secretly committing resources to ensure or prevent a certain event from occurring. 

The various uses of the cards belie the actual tactical depth. Since you are strongly rewarded for emptying your hand each turn, it’s not so much IF you should use these cards, but simply how. The voting is often determined by an extreme bonus given to the player with the fewest victory points, such that often one or both players simply don’t bother playing voting cards. The best attacking cards work better when played alone, so the other cards generally function as money. The choices aren’t as tough (or meaningful) as they might seem.

The weakest point of all is Booker and his girlfriend. They run around the board in a purely random fashion, often utterly destroying the units on the space they move to. They add nothing to the game other than uncontrollable chaos and seem to only be here to follow the story of the videogame.

Considering what a crowded field this genre is and the very limited player numbers this game works with (removing all the negotiation and alliance options found in similar games), they really needed to come up with something a bit fresher to really catch my interest. Perhaps fans of the videogame will be more forgiving, but it just didn’t work for me.

Purchased this for 10 bucks and I feel I got my money's worth. This is strictly a two-player game however, the 4 player game uses teams, which splits both sides armies which is extremely lame and not recommended. 

The rules and mechanics are pretty easy to understand, and many of the components are pretty good quality. I wish the minis were a tad bigger, but there are a ton of them. Handling and tracking upgrades can be fiddly at times, and it's even worse cause a gust of air or a misplaced elbow can knock everything away. 

Solid game. Wish the playtime was a bit shorter, but will still play this game if it's requested but strictly as a two-player outing.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

Being a huge fan of the video game, one of my favorites of all time, I was so excited to get stuck into the game and it really didn't disappoint. I imagine this isn't an unbiased review, but I really enjoy the bidding and upgrade mechanics, and love how the skyline can literally change the game at a moments notice. Each round can be a little long but is filling with weighty decisions. Plus the artwork is spot-on, I felt like I was right there in Columbia. (^_^)

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Brilliantly realized theme. You really feel like you're in Columbia.
- There are many paths to victory with both area and card objectives. But you definitely need a mix of both to win. 
- The skylines add a little excitement to the game without being too chaotic. 
- Leveling up each cards stats or unlocking special abilities is a ton of fun. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- If you loose two major conflicts is a row, you can be pushed right back into a corner with no chance of regaining territory making the last several rounds drag on forever.
- Filled with the personal wish that they had found a way to make the board modular so you can move pieces around by yourself.
-Booker and Liz don't add that much to the game. 
- The card play is fun but some of the elixir cards can be a little useless.

Area control game based in the Bioshock: Infinite universe. The sky hook travelling was interesting and adds a push your luck mechanic when trying to move troops through faster means.

The one downside we found was that if you amassed a sizable army and just sat on Elizabeth you were guaranteed to score points quite easily as Booker would just show up to rescue her, get defeated and you would earn points every turn guaranteed. Unless your opponent is really watching out for this situation it can lead to an auto win sometimes.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (June 2016)

I didn’t know what to expect from BioShock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia. I haven’t played the videogame, in fact it’s been a long time since I last played ANY videogame (boardgames replaced them for me :D), but as the game is from Plaid Hat Games I had high hopes for it, sadly, I was sorely disappointed.

The rules of the game aren’t complex, but there are many rules. You can explain the game under 20 minutes. I didn’t read the rulebook but the friend who did said it wasn’t very clear in many respects. Playtime is more than 2 hours, which is a long time for what the game offers.

The art of the game is very good and the game components are from ok to good. 

The theme is ok, I guess I would enjoy it more if I have played the videogame, but I’m not sure because my gaming partner did play it and he was bored by the game as well. Having saying that, I didn’t feel the theme to be coherent through the game.

BioShock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia features multi-purpose cards (a plus) and an interesting card upgrade system, however the cards get stale very soon because there aren’t really that many different cards and the upgrade system is boring because you cannot upgrade beyond 2 more upgrades than your opponent. This is a very artificial way to keep balance and it feels very unthematic. The cards themselves don’t offer interesting decisions, everything is obvious and clear. 

The Boooker mechanism is weird and doesn’t work well. In our game Booker attacked me each turn because Elizabeth appeared in one of my controlled areas. He always attacked me and I had to leave a small army to defend from him. I tried to move Elizabeth, but the restrictive movement rules didn’t allow for this so Booker attacked me each turn. This made possible that I upgraded quickly to the limit (unbalanced the game), but on the other hand I couldn’t use those units to get new terrains. Having Elizabeth didn’t net me any benefit but I think in other scenarios this could be very advantageous. I feel this mechanism only adds chaos to an already random game.

The game is heavily biased toward defense. Defending a position is extremely easy. Once you have a strong position in a terrain, you won’t lose it through battle (perhaps an event can wipe you out). The attacker cannot move enough units to defeat you and if he is using the skyline, the risk is too high and everything is decided by luck. The only possibility is attacking very lightly defended terrains, otherwise, attacking is a losing proposition.

The movement of units is too restrictive, not interesting at all.

BioShock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia is designed ONLY as a two player game, with four players, they just divide the armies and resources and that’s just dumb. Playing with 4 players doesn’t add anything to the game but increased play and downtime.

The luck factor is through the roof, not only you need the right cards to accomplish your goals, there is also lots of dice rolling and you need dice to move through the skyline. The events feel unbalanced.

The Voting system with two player feels weird, moreover when you throw a dice to help one side. More often than not, we didn’t play any cards In this phase.

Bottom line, BioShock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia is a very simple area control game with some add-ons that hurt it. The decisions needed to play are very obvious and uninteresting. I have been drifting away from most dudes-on-a-map games, but even so, the game is bad. Too much randomness and way too unbalanced. I was bored since the beginning. I will do my best to stay away from it and I already sold my copy of the game. I expected way more from Plaid Hat Games and Isaac Vega.

loved the video game and this does it justice! It does so much more than emulate the game. It explores the workings of the flying city of Columbia at a much deeper level than the video game. If you played the video game and thought that Columbia made no sense, this game really does it justice. I love how the game handles Booker and Elizabeth. I have a hard time imagining how it would feel to play without knowing the source material. That may affect your overall enjoyment, but it is just so well executed and fun.

Like most Amerithrashy area control games, this really isn't my cup of tea. Skylines add an interesting wrinkle to troop movement, though it's very luck based, like the whole game. Hand size is too small, with no way to increase it. Booker is an annoyance, and can wildly swing your fortune. Theme comes through pretty well.

A solid Ameritrash romp. Nicely assymetrical, and the team competition aspect was quite cool. I think we got a couple of things wrong, and there were times when I felt like I was a little bit at mercy of my card draws or bad dice rolls, but overall, any bad luck and randomness was easily offset by good planning. Reminded me quite a bit of Age of Conan. I definitely look forward to playing this one again and think I might rate it higher with future plays.

This game is so underrated, every game I've played of it has always grown into this epic area control game, you and the win almost always came out of no where.

You're in your own corner doing your thing while your opponent is in their corner doing their own thing but sooner or later you're going to clash, on top of that you have Booker and Elizabeth going around doing their own thing and attacking you, the voting adds something new each round along with the victory cards. Just a great game, I've played with people who do not know much about Bioshock and they've had great experiences too.

-Too random, sometimes punishing losing player

Bought it cause it said "Bioshock". Have played it a few times and it felt really random and unfair at times. One time, my opponent tried a risky skyline move that failed. Immediately after that, he got attacked by Booker. This gave me a huge advantage without having to do a thing, and in a position my opponent couldn't come back from. If a game is random like that it needs to be funny, which this game isn't. It was one of my first modern games though and I was surprised at what games could do: "Costum dice???" "Upgrading stuff?!?" "Dynamic turn order!?!"

An enjoyable game that is very true to the source material. Parts of it are a little rough around the edges, like with being able to upgrade and unlock different things for your cards, but overall it's much better than I expected it to be. In particular, I found the travel by the skyline to be very interesting, as it presents an interesting push-your-luck element that you don't normally see in these sorts of games. Some minor tweaks would help the game be much better, and I do wish that this would have taken place in Rapture rather than Columbia, but the game is a fun 2p game in the same vein as Nexus Ops.

心得:
兩人對打的佔地遊戲
卡牌升級蠻有創意的，但是效果還好
且只能比對手高三級的限制很容易忘記
腳色能力差異略大，要攻擊別人領地似乎相對困難
且NPC的移動有時候會打亂平衡
不過劇情帶入感還OK，純玩機制完比較乾一點
規則:
*兩人遊戲設置，隨機選一張伊莉莎白時間卡，token放最上面，世界事件卡跟勝分卡洗云，打開一張勝分卡，所有沒人的區域放置蓋著的領地token，隨機選起始完家
*藍色玩家拿所有深藍模型建築加上淺藍的普通單位模型，藍色會放一個要塞跟兩個領袖三個普通單位在9，一個堡壘一個特殊跟四個普通單位在11，並拿藍色牌庫抽五張，在抽一張領袖牌，並拿對應參考表
*紅色玩家拿紅色模型建築跟深紅普通單位模型，紅色要塞跟對應單位放在14，堡壘對應單位放在5，並拿紅色牌庫抽五張，在抽一張領袖牌，並拿對應參考表
*遊戲每輪有三個階段，直到有人先得十分獲勝，或是伊莉莎白逃出(要開事件卡沒牌)，分數高的贏，或是有人單位建築全沒算輸

1.世界事件階段，開一張事件卡，由起始玩家開始蓋著出牌，一起出完牌在打開，如果有分數差，booker會幫分數低的投一顆白骰，世界結果只要是0以上就會發生，出最多影響力的會成為起始玩家(平手擲白骰決定)，卡上有伊莉莎白頭像就移動伊莉莎白時間卡往下一格，併結算該格事件，放置booker在右下角對應數字區(城市毀滅就降序放相鄰城市)，如果伊莉莎白出現就放在伊莉莎白的位置上(並攻擊該格上的人)，如果卡上有booker標記他也會攻擊(booker戰鬥骰三顆紅骰)

2.玩家階段
A 出牌換錢
B 雇單位，建設，買升級(三元)，建築跟單位只能放在有你的人的地方，一個城市只能有一個建築，買升級也只能在此時做
C 移動四個單位一次，在天梯上移動要擲三顆天梯骰，只有純數字就要棄對應數量牌，否則該單位消失，可移動數次，兩陣營空軍可在天梯上移動兩次不用擲骰(只能兩步)
D 處理戰鬥，攻擊方蓋著出牌，換防守方蓋著出牌，開卡，擲骰，加總決勝負，平手防守方獲勝，如果該位置有booker，booker最後處理

3.更新階段，棄任易數量手牌補到五張，開一張勝分卡

*城市毀滅後放對應標記，上面設施移除，人物不能再進入，宣告占領區時可以不用包含該區
*建築
1.要塞，戰鬥時提供一顆紅骰，戰敗移除一隻腳色後，其它要撤退到有要塞的城市，否則移除
2.堡壘 戰鬥提供一顆藍骰，包含該城市跟相鄰城市
3.警報 戰鬥提供一顆白骰，且每顆骰子結果加1
*升級方式 1.戰鬥勝利 2.三塊買 3.成為起始玩家 4.獲得勝分卡 ，升級只能比對手多三個
*該區城市都占領可放對應勝分，完成勝分卡條件，玩家回合可放勝分(同張只能有一個人放，也不會在失去)

A fun game with some unwieldy flaws. First off, the cards and the board look gorgeous. The minis are competent, but the Songbird mini (the one that matters) is kind of poorly  constructed and keeps tipping over. 

The game gives you many difficult choices on each turn. You get five cards, but what do you want to spend the cards on, influence, money, or firepower? You only get to move four units a turn, but with a little risk, they could move almost anywhere. The objectives take the best part about Nexus Ops - rewarding gutsy plays - and makes them communal and public, which should have been how Nexus Ops handled it, so both players are jousting to get the same things. 

There are a few issues, however. There are a number of confusing interactions that the barely adequate rulebook fails to address in any way. There are also strategic considerations that do not make themselves clear unless you've played it already, for example: why would anyone want to control Elizabeth? It's not addressed at all in the rules, and nobody bothers trying until you get to the first timeline event that says "whoever controls her gets 10 silver eagles" and you're both like "ohhhhhhh... wish I'd seen that!" I can see this game rewards repeat plays (you know what to look out for in objectives, action cards, timelines, votable issues, etc.) and I'm all for getting there, but it's a little bit more of a crapshoot than I'd like in the interim.

Mechanically, the game works great as a 'dudes on a map' war game, but it definitely overstayed it's welcome. I think it was due to the stalemate we got ourselves into.

Wonderful game. I love the way you can earn or buy upgrades for your action cards. Combat is fun, since it's fairly low risk. For losing in combat, you remove just 1 plastic figure (usually a wimpy unit) and then the rest of your force respawns at another of your bases. This increases skirmishes in a fun way.

The layout of the board is also very well thought out. Movement between areas needs to be planned out, and there are natural defense points that you discover.

The game plays smoothly, and the thrust of it is each turn a new achievement is revealed in a twilight imperium sort of way. Players compete to complete them in addition to the points they get for holding regions of the board. Meanwhile, the hero and damsel from the video game are wandering around the board, and you have to avoid getting punched by them. It's a really fun and unique take on a video game inspired board game.

I'm not convinced 4 player mode is more than an afterthought. I would love to see a proper multi-player incarnation of these mechanics.

I really enjoy this game! I think the voting, events, and NPC concepts really make this game distinct compared to other area control games. The NPCs can really swing a game ine one direction or another, which can be upsetting for most. I, on the other hand, like this concept because it forces players to maintain a flexible strategy. I wouldn't recommend for those beautiful mind genius types.

A risk-style game. Uses the theme very well with plenty of mechanics, such as Booker and Elizabeth running around wrecking both teams and various game changing events, such a location on the map blowing up and becoming inaccessible. Some people won't like the random nature of some aspects, such as Booker randomly moving to a location and slaughtering the player there, plus the heavy dice rolling aspect. It also has some odd pacing issues: very few victory point are earned for most of the game, then its suddenly over in a burst of two or three turns

 I really like some of the ideas of this game. This game uses the "cards have multiple uses" mechanism that I really like, so this means every turn has great choices about how to best utilize cards. I also really like the way that upgrades work, and that may be the highlight of the game play. My problem with this game is the randomness. This game takes elements of a card driven area control game and combines them with Risk-style dice chucking. On paper to me this sounds like a decent idea. However, the execution means the negative aspects of the mashup are both there. There is the randomness of the card draw from CDGs and there is the randomness of the dice. The combination can make for some extremely frustrating turns where nothing can come together, or if the cards actually work the dice roll terribly (this is the worst with moving on the sky hooks). This randomness can combine in some bad ways that really causes the pace of the game to start to grind in a bad way.

It has cool features and hits lots of items on the checklist, but the game and theme, like other Plaid Hat games, just doesn't come to life for me.

'Voting' on events - they aren't very powerful and voting with 2 players just feels degenerate.
Booker/Elizabeth - variable path to the game sounds cool, but it just feels tacked-on with minimal effect on gameplay. Booker just amounts to a moving nuke. Sad excuse to brush away the protagonists of the video game and just seems like it was contractually/thematically obligated.
Upgrades - the main engine of the game, but it seems like upgrades happen so often that it's not a matter of choosing what path to take but getting to collect 'em all in a set flow to the game.
Objective race - I like games with this

Like City of Remnants, the ingredients are there, but it just feels conservative as a whole. Card powers are weak/nerfy. Units/structures are delineated very surgically (white/blue/red dice). Going behind enemy lines is simulated by a 'Skyline' monorail that gives you increasing dice odds of crashing the further you travel... I just like that abstracted with card text (a daring mission) instead of boring dice (I moved too far, crashed, blah).

3+2

Thankfully, this isn't a rushed tie-in game - it's quite fun to play, and I feel the flavor/universe is well-implemented. I like the Elizabeth/Booker mechanic, randomly appearing around the board and fighting your units. That being said, I personally think it's overly confusing - there are a lot of symbols to keep track of, and while it's really neat that every card has three uses, it gives players a lot to keep track of.

There's a couple of things that are really holding this back from being a great game.  Booker is one of them..  if he only attacks one of the players during the game, they are at a HUGE disadvantage.  Some of the event cards seem really unbalanced and once the location tokens have all been taken over, the game really seems to stall out with the lack of income.  I want to like this game, but I'm starting to wonder if I ever will.  Maybe it would be better with 4 as opposed to 2, but I know if I would ever suggest it over other games that I KNOW are good with 4.

RATING: 7
2 player game that plays like City of Remnants with more focus on attacking, less on building, and a pretty board instead of the butt-ugly one. I like it. The combat system is pretty similar to City of Remnants.

Painful decisions about how to use your cards, and there is a lot of reward to tempt you to take risks -- you are just as likely to be punished for conservative play as for ballsy play. I like that.

Slightly concerned that the game may be overly defensive, as defending is pretty easy with only limited movement options and a bunch of turtle structures, but then again there are multiple fronts you have to defend. I don't know. The upgrade stuff gave a sense of progression to the game, but on the other hand the components (+1, +2 markers) were sort of annoying to handle.

This is a reasonably simple area control game with some nice mechanics backing up that core gameplay.

The best part is how each of the cards in the game can be played for 1 of 3 or 4 purposes.  Each card has a vote, production, and combat value and sometimes another separate action and can be used for any of these purposes.  This also presents an interesting hand management aspect as you don't get to draw new cards during your turn so using the cards for one purpose gives you less options for the others.

One thing I was disappointed with is there aren't as many cards as I originally thought there would be in these decks so after a couple rounds you've seen most, if not all of them.  The bigger gripes I had with the game were a. that it was two-player only and b. the board felt a bit claustrophobic.

Yes, by the way, I know it can be played with 2 or 4 players but 4-players is really just 2 players with 2 people making up each player.  And an area control game that only plays 2 players is kind of missing the point in my opinion.  On top of which one of the worst mistakes you can make in a worker placement game is make the board feel too crowded.  ESPECIALLY when there's only ever two players on the board.

These two things keep me from loving the game but I do really like it.  The ability to vote for events at the start of each round is pretty cool and competing for victory point achievements gives each player variable direction to make the game feel a bit fresh every game.  There's even a 3rd force in the game that can randomly affect the players.

Also, the board, cards, and plastic pieces are very attractive.  And while I've never played Bioshock Infinite, there is so much going on in service to theme I would wager they took very good care of the licensed property.

This is a clever little game that came out of nowhere.  It is a little Dudes on the Map game that plays quickly and which has the ability to upgrade your dudes.  It is a good alternative to Nexus Ops when I want a decent short DoaM game.  A nice surprise that I picked up for a bargain.

RATING: 4
BioShock Infinite, the videogame, is about the player-controlled Booker rampaging through the city of Columbia in order to rescue Elizabeth. The Siege of Columbia flips things around; players take control of two factions fighting for control of the city, with Booker and Elizabeth wandering at random around the board causing havoc.

Mechanically it's a dudes-on-a-map area control game with bells and whistles. Players build units and buildings (which add various combat bonuses); combat is resolved via special dice (better units have better dice) and by playing face-down hand cards to add to the combat value. Cards can also be used for money or to influence votes -- essentially yay or nay for a particular random event -- or for a special ability. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this is that these cards can be upgraded over the course of the game. Each is shown on the faction's player board with four upgrade slots. The special ability is not available at the start of the game and must be unlocked by an upgrade; similarly, each of the card's other attributes (money, attack, influence) can be increased, one point at a time, by up to two. 

It's clear that considerable effort has been put into ensuring that games play out differently each time. Some points are scored by controlling territories on the board; more are available from victory condition cards (such as "3VP if you control 4 territories"), which are dribbled out at a rate of one per round. Naturally, some of these are much, much harder than others, so some games may go much longer by dint of unachievable VP cards appearing early.

In practice, it's just OK. It isn't my favourite genre, but even within that genre it can't hold up to classics like Nexus Ops or Fortress America. Combat is heavily biased towards the defender (break ties, skyline movement rules, building dice, card bonuses) so once a location is held it can be very hard to break into. Some of the random events are utterly devastating -- e.g., destroy all buildings and units in a region -- and there is no real narrative connection.

The rules in the box are also terrible. It could work with the right group; that group will not include me.

For this type of game, it's decent, but I only really played it for the theme, on which it somewhat delivered.  It is overpriced and not my kind of game.  Card powers aren't TOO insane, but the events and the scoring cards are going to drive the action of the game over anything else.  And they are massively swingy, just like in most of these games.  If they were brought more under control and possibly known for a few turns ahead of time, it would really make it more strategically interesting.   The combination of cards and dice was sometimes clever, and I could see it having a reasonable playing time if everyone knew what they were doing, but I doubt I'll find out.

I know nothing about the IP, so I don't get the locations or the different characters. This could easily have been any semi-related theme (in fact, I may do an Amazonian insect re-theme that could be cool and appeal to younger kids). 

Also, I may need to play it more, since I don't really see the point of Elizabeth without Booker. I mean, I defeat Booker and take control of Elizabeth . . . so? Surely there's some advantage to that I have missed.

The Siege of Columbia seems at first glance like a mildly spiffy Dudes on a Map game, but it turns out that this coating of spiff is enough to make it fresh and exciting. Awesome rules for movement, no stalemates, clean combat, multiple uses for each card, and a fun story in the sidelines about the characters from the videogame — though you don't need to know anything at all about the world of Bioshock Infinite in order to enjoy this. One of the best games of the year.

Solid area control game.  Challenging but fair.  I was surprised, I thought it was only a two player game, and that four players would just be crowding, but it's actually set up to be 2v2, complete with separate decks and figures (blue/dark blue Founders, red/dark red Vox Populi).  Keeping you on your toes the entire time are Booker and Elizabeth, traipsing throughout Columbia, wreaking havoc on both armies.  Very good game!

I was a big fan of the video game, despite its flaws. As for the board game, I loved the theme, artwork, and general concept, but playing it was another story. Far too long, far too random, and not even remotely fun to play. Easily one of the worst games I've ever played.

Pretty cool game and neat implementation. It's not trying to recreate Bioshock Infinite but just be a game set in that universe, and it does so quite well. Impossible to be a "long" game given the way Elizabeth acts to push the game end, and the finite number of cards in the world event deck which can be a game end trigger. Very well put together. 

[ImageID=554376]

Put simply, this is a 2 player game. There's not a way at all to play it with 3 players, and the 4 player game is a 2v2 team game, so of course it's going to "work" as a 2 player game. Not taking anything away from this game except the fact that the game says it supports 2-4, when in reality is supports 2, 4.

Solid area control game. There are a lot of moving parts and many things to keep track of. The game is not overly complicated and once you get going it's pretty smooth. Some luck involved with card draw and mostly dice rolling for combat. The art, theme and components are all very good. I wouldn't recommend playing with 4 players as it's really just a 2 player game. I could see this improving with more plays.

This was so close to being a great game. I think it does a good job of delivering the video game experience to the tabletop and if you put some work in, I think there is a hidden gem here. The main thing holding it back is the card ability unlock system. While I think it is brilliant idea, the execution really bogs the game down. Having to constantly keep track of the number of bonuses both players have at all times and then constantly referring to your player board to check what each card could do at any particular point in the game gets really tedious. I am sure that would fade a little with multiple plays, but a game of this nature (2-3 hours, 2 players) just isn't going to get that sort of attention. For me, this game feels like it needed a hair more development. There's no question however, That Isaac Vega is a designer to keep an eye on. He's got some pretty great ideas, for sure.

Team vs. team miniature battle for area control in the Bioshock universe.  Founders against the Vox with Booker is a badass and Elizabeth causes a sequence of events causing chaos or helping the losing team.  Cards are mult-use. Blind bid on votes is very cool idea. Flip the cards and total the influence. Take control of an area for points and to get an area benefit tile. Upgradable units is a tiny bit fiddly for me. Some units need their power unlocked. Special movement dice and battle dice. The stronger the unit the more punch on the die.

This game has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.

This game is an amalgamation of seemingly *infinite* (pun intended) mechanics. The rules poorly explain all the decisions. When you do get a decision it boils down to incredibly unfair die rolls.

Specifically the 'skyline' rules are just tuned poorly. Moving an army along the skylines should be an interesting and rewarding choice. However it's so easy to mobilize a defensive force yet moving a force that would even have a *chance* in combat hardly ever succeeds moving along the skyline. You have to do this to get from continent to continent.

Booker & Elizabeth are just random events that grant no player agency. Moreover they can instantly swing the game to one side.

All that being said, the game is gorgeous and flavorful. The components are well crafted for the most part and the minis get the job done. The board itself is particularly pretty.

I just wish the mechanics were tuned and the game tried to do one thing well instead of a million different things poorly.

I'm giving this one an 8. It is an excellent game with tons of strategy and very interesting but good mechanics. 

The only reason this isn't a 9 or 10 is the replay-ability of this game might not be as high as it should be. Sure you have different leaders, different Elizebeth timelines, but you see all of your action cards every game and most of the world events and VPs are seen in each game.

RATING: 6
The rules are simple and the rulebook is very clear.  The theme is very heavy in the map, minis, and cards.  Nice that you can use cards for combat, influence, or money.  The upgrades allow you to pursue different strategies like lots of units or fewer, more powerful ones.  It's disappointing that you can win the game with almost no interaction with the other player and game victory can be very heavily based on which victory cards popped up.  Like Conan and Runewars, you have these special characters bouncing around the board causing random chaos, but without really adding much to the game.  It would have helped if the rulebook would have given you some background about the game because I don't really understand what the story is supposed to be.
If you are going to buy this, wait for a sale because it should be a MSRP $50 game.

i liked it but didn't fall head over heals, although I'm not a huge bioshock video game fan.

I am however a huge chaos in the old world fan, and it seemed like a 2 player version of that, set in bioshock universe.  mix in a little Risk and random events. 

i did like how the cards can be used for 3 different things, cool game.

• This game is prone to leaving one player feeling completely unfulfilled.

• A set board with set starting locations kills the replay value once you've figured out your strategy by the third game or so.

• The Vox's Airship card is so much more powerful than the Founder's Songbird card that they had to release a promo Enraged Songbird card that you have to buy through the Geek Store and replace the old card with in order to balance the game out.

Interesting auction mechanic and some nice bits.  Does not play well with 3, because generally one person will be the "odd man out" that gets stuck going last each round.

RATING: 5
A set collection, tile-layer with a fairly unique mechanism of making "offers" to other players.

The components are very good (except for the card stock), there are a couple of ways to score (largest continuous camel herd, 3 different tile regions, provided of course you have the scoring tiles as well), and at first the offers seem an interesting to initiate gameplay.  The problem is that there really is no control, making the game highly tactical with little to no strategy.  This is unfortunate, as there seems to be the potential for a good game, but it doesn't quite do it.  On the plus side, gameplay is relatively short and the ending is slightly unpredictable.  Definitely a disappointment overall.

So far, I've only played this with 3 players, and I expect that it would be better with 4.  Having said that, there's plenty going on here!  Lots to think about.  Not only what do you want, but what don't  you want others to have, and what will they get by default if you get that bid that you most want.  Elements of San Marco and just a touch of Ra, and then there's the tile majority/multiplier stuff on top of that.

Nice.  Not hard to learn, but the best strategy is not easy.

My initial play was excellent. The mechanics work really well and make for a tightly balanced game. Players can haul themselves up from last to first position in the card offerings and improve their game posistion as a result. Very enjoyable and clever.

Subsequent plays have raised my view. This is so clever and likely to be a game that is played in a year's time.

Collect symbols,camels and terrain in Mongolia. An interesting game with all players declaring cards for the above as there offer each round. Persuade opponents to collect the cards you are offering from your hand to enable you to get an early choice of whats on offer each round and thus collect sets of the required symbols,camels and terrain to score the points. I like the game and would play anytime.

I loved everything about this game except for the fact that it's broken in one way, which totally sucks if you run into it.  We played a five player game and, purely down to the luck of the cards, after four rounds I was pretty much out of the game and knew it.  I then had to sit there for the next hour, going fourth or fifth in every round, accomplishing little, while everyone else had fun with what was otherwise a very nice game.    I made no mistakes in the game at all, and kept trying to improve my position even though I knew I was doomed to last, and still finished 50 points behind fourth and 93 points behind the winner...

Nice game.  Clever, fun etc.  Totally ruined if you run into that situation.

The game is uncontrollable and unable to plan that cause this game has some unexpected PA.
The game is frenzy and unbalance.

The game depend on luck much more than strategies because the card opening is all of the game. If the right cards are opened, you will gain the priority and advantage. And if the right cards are still opened you can win easily. In contrast, there are boring losers sit beside.

RATING: 5
{1 play • 5 player} Interesting, I guess... but it just didn't grab me.  Without the blind offer the game would bog down, but with it, it feels too random.  Eh.

[after two more plays, both 5-player]  Rating remains a low 5.  The randomness of the cards is tough to counter if everyone isn't playing "correctly," and even then, there are times when why should they?  Plus, you can hang back and come in last in an auction, only to get screwed on the next turn... and be hampered, cards-wise, for your troubles.  Ouch.  No fun.  Players who you think are leaders often aren't, allowing other players not just to sneak by, but in one case, to score a riduclous 150-something, almost lapping the other 4 players.  And yet, even with these complaints, there's still some sort of game here.  Maybe with 4 players instead of 5...

This was easy to learn, a valuable thing these days. Easy to get people into. Light to medium strategy potential. All around just solid I thought. I seem to like it more each time I play. Different number of players really changes the gameplay. Just the right balance for a strong lighter game.

i'm pretty sure i dislike this game, but it will take another play to find out.  with 3, the selection can be completely deterministic because the 1st player can force the other players' choices.  i like the card offer idea, but i think it's too chaotic for it to be totally random.  let us pick 1 out of 2 cards or something maybe.  scoring as you go seems way better, and i have a problem with games that i think would be better off with it but make it feel kludgy, such as hacienda.  the nail in the coffin for my game was the apparent runaway leader problems.  but like i said, i'd somewhat grudgingly give it another shot.  hopefully with 4-5 players.

Very tightly balanced game. Very fun to play, and offers many meaningful decisions. I find it has many elements reminescent of other Moon & Moon/Weissblum designs, but it feels more complete and integrated, despite the fact that the others don't feel incomplete or unintegrated. It is a remarkably good game, and had the best "grab-me" factor of any game i have played for the first time since Puerto Rico.

An extremely interesting game. In some areas you lack control (blind offering is the big one) but in all cases that lack of control is justified. The tile-laying mechanic works very well and evenly distributes power to the three basic tiles. The camels are a screw-fest if ever I've seen one, but the rewards seem to be worth the risk.

Just not fun with 3 players.  I've finally played with 5 players, and I've changed my tune a bit.  With more players, there's a lot more interaction.  The board gets very crowded, and each player has to specialize in order to score well.  Not sure how well it scales to 4.

One play.  Unbridled silliness was par for the course during our game, and as a result we had a lot of fun.  The board game part was a bit superfluous and not necessary -- rare was the time that we legitimately felt constrained -- but the card play was brilliant.  A card-game version of Oasis in a small box would be awesome.

Decent game.  I don't like the auctions.  The random / press-your-luck style offering of cards for auction can be frustrating.  Also, the cards are too thin.  ** I need to try a more strategic variant in which you can look at what you have in your stack of cards, but you cannot change the order.

It's typically overstated for most games, but in this case "DO NOT PLAY THIS WITH ONLY 3 PLAYERS" is very much true.  In fact, do not play this with 4 players.  This is very fun as a 5 player game.  I don't even think just shrinking the board would help the 4 player experience... there is something about how the bid tokens move around that REQUIRES 5 people to keep the leaders from running away with the thing.  I rarely win this game, but always enjoy it.  I usually feel good that I'm making good choices, but someone always seems to make slightly better decisions than me...

RATING: 3
Didn't like this at all - dry with a distinct lack of control. Offer system sounds like it would add a nice mechanic, but in practice it is just frustrating. Turn order mechanic adds to the lack of control too, being first is nice if you get stuff turned up you want. Having stuff the person going first wants is nice because then you'll get the crucial extra action and go first next turn. Also has a 'take that' element where you can squeeze others by your tile placements, but the lack of control means it ends up being rather arbitrary. Feels like a game that should reward forward planning, but mechanism for actions kills that off. Maybe if there was a draft system where you picked your new cards rather than a blind draw it might help ... end game was a bit anticlimactic too - winner was pretty obvious a few turns off. All in all bored me.

Simple enough tile laying game that moves quickly once the rules are distilled to the essense of the game. Steppes tiles preprinted on the board could have been more noticable and differentiated from the sand.

The only thing you can control in this game is tile/camel placement, and that is almost always very simple, obvious game play.  You have a complete lack of control in the auction segment: you do not get to choose what cards you auction or what cards you draw, so by sheer luck you can be stuck in last place burning through cards nobody wants and stay there for several turns -- taking you out of contention for the game after 10 minutes of play (but of course you have to sit through the next 50 minutes so everyone else can play).  I enjoy the mechanics of the game, and the bits are nice, but that huge random factor really turns me off.

Just played this for the first time with 4. The wife loved the game. I'm going to hold judgment. At first the "market" concept of displaying 1-3 cards seemed very random/strange. But as the game progressed I could see a bit of tactics emerging. Not a lot... It seems a bit too random to me, but we'll wait and see. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game! Whether or not to flip just one more card in the offer phase to get the extra action granted by getting the number one token is sometimes a tough decision to make, especially for the player in the number two spot. What to do with that extra choice is usually fairly obvious -- try to make sure you're as balanced as possible in each of the scoring combinations so as to maximize that score, and if you have one area that's huge, make it even bigger. No rectangular tiles means the area is worthless. One makes it worth something, and two doubles that. While returns diminish proportionally after that, they're still often larger than trying something else. Build big. On the other hand, which offer to choose isn't always so obvious. Even when one offer would gain you more points right now, sometimes it's more important to choose an offer that will let you place tiles to cut off an opponent's growth space. Leaving a juicy offer for another opponent to take who can do the same to someone else brings in a bit of subtle diplomacy, as well. Also, if for some reason, someone has to leave before the game is really over, it's usually OK to end the game and score up at the end of the current round. This is helpful if it's supper time and someone is glaring at the table you're using for a game, but that should have food on it.... Anyway, great game!

RATING: 7
A rather good, light, network-scoring game from Moon & Weissblum.  It has a fair bit of luck, particularly in the semi-blind bidding (the result of which is a wee bit reminiscent of Nicht die Bohne! http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192), but the luck element is appropriate for the weight and length of the game - which fairly barrels along once you get going.

I think there's a wee bit of a problem with the end game though as the luck at that point could have disproprtionate effect.  The solution I suggest is to go for non-blind bidding for the last round (so when the end game is triggered - when, say, the number of any one of the three tiles is less than the number of players - you pick up your cards and then decide to bid one, two or three as usual).  The main effect would be to ensure that you don't blindly offer up 30 or more points to your opponents with the game's last gasp (NB Playing the whole game that way would slow it to a boring crawl, but I think it's justified for the end-game).

A 6 after my first play. Clearclaw must be getting to me because the hidden-but-trackable multipliers annoyed me. The tension of the game is, like many medium-weight games, predicated on not remembering specifically what your opponents have. I used to really go for that, but have started to see it as a pretty cheap ruse that tends to get in the way of good games and covers up the flaws in bad ones. Like a quick coat of paint and some new carpeting. Regardless of the quality of the underlying game, the opening up the trackable element tends to make a 'fun' game heavier. I'll try opening this one up next time. Other things that might make the game heavier but better are introducing hand management rather than the random offerings. I've heard that that can make the game drag too much. Alas, maybe this game needs to be what it is: light, random fare.

A tile placement game that ends up being a little too uncontrollable for my tastes. Essentially players are putting down 4 types of tiles (including the camels) and are trying to simultaneously acquire chits that will multiply with their tiles on the board to score points. This is a fairly run of the mill base system, but then the game is thrown by the bizarre offer system where each player flips cards from their personal deck up randomly, from 1-3, as an offer to the other players. The reason this is important is that the order in which the players take the offerings will determine next turns player order. Additionally, the less cards you offer, the more you will have available on your pool, but the higher the chances that you'll get a bad place in the turn order. This seems sort of interesting, but the problem is that the lack of control over what you're offering beyond the flat number of cards can really hurt players who offer the full complement of 3 cards, get nothing to replace their now-depleted stack with, and still end up with a 3 or lower spot in the turn order because their stuff just didn't turn out to be that good. Even flipping over 2 mediocre cards can really hurt because you only get 1 replacement card for them. This couples with the turn order mechanism to make things very odd. Being in first is fantastic, if and only if the other players turn up a set of offerings that are palatable to you. Being in the back of the pack is either a fixable issue, or a death sentence depending on what you can flip up out of your deck. The end result is a scoring mechanism which should be rewarding planning ahead, which combines very awkwardly with the offering system, which doesn't allow you to have enough control to make the worth of planning ahead predictable. Some promise in the concept of the game, but I didn't care for the end result.

Played this with 4 people and thought it was excellent. I like auction games and area control games so this suites me fine. I found the game to be very elegant as described by some. After reading the comments I can see it would be worse with 3 players but even better with 5 players so this is a very solid game overall.

I've only had one game with 3 players and I'm pretty sure it would play much better with 4 and 5 players. But even with three players it seemed like a game of constant evaluation with the potential for a large social play factor. I want to try this with more people. Based on one play.

A really fun game that is easy to learn and rewards good placement. Though there is the random elements (offering cards), I think it can be compensated by good tactical placement. So far, a 4 player games seems more tense and 3 player games are more tactical as usually player #1 get the best pick for controlling the round, while player 2 and 3 need to attract player #1 in order to stay in control for the next round.

I also felt like there were many times where I was just flat out screwed by my opponents, although whether they did it on purpose or were just bad players, I don't know.  It seems that if you play this with people that don't know much about auctioning and the like that the game is not as fun.

I think I want to try futzing with the card offering mechanics, as some have suggested. Still, with rules as written, it works just fine. The positioning on the board is almost a *distraction* from the main game, which requires comitting to 1 or 2 terrain types.

RATING: 7
This is a fairly pleasant game that's easy to teach and relatively quick to play.  I enjoy the angst of determining how much is enough to offer (everyone wants to please the noble the most!).  It is possible for luck to swing the game when too much is offered and one player benefits greatly.

There are good ideas in Oasis. Its main attraction for me is area control, where you try to block players from growing their areas too large. This is good stuff, on par with any game which uses this mechanism. There are also bad ideas in Oasis, like for example the random and closed card draw, which may see you get stuck with uninteresting cards and options because you couldn't form an offer which appealed to those going early in a game round. Of course with increasing player number the chances of finding something useful are larger, so the game is probably better as the number of players increases. Still, we're dealing with a barely controlled random draw. Overall I think Oasis is quite nice family material, definitely on the somewhat more taxing end of the scale as players are required to figure out the balance between positional play and the value of various offers to other players. As for myself, I wish it had a little more bite, though.

Tile laying/area control auction game with solid components and minimal downtime. The central auction mechanism is pretty unique, but breaks down with the minimum amount of players, making a 3-player game very luck-heavy. It comes more into it's own when playing with the full five players, when the offer mechanic and shuffling for a better position becomes meaningful, but then again, there are more than a few games I'd rather play when I have five people on hand.

Production: Beautiful board, tiles, and pawns.  Play: I enjoy the offering segment, the determination of turn order, and the different land types.  As I understand the mathematics of the scoring, the best possible outcome would be for a player to have only one type of terrain, and an equal amount of scoring tiles.  That the offers of other players force diversity upon us does not necessarily lead to interesting decisions, as it is usually easy to calculate the point increase promised by each lot.  I think the real tension in the game comes from jockeying for the order markers.  If players had a hand of cards, from which they could deliberately select their offers, I think the game might feel more controllable, in the sense that players could budget not just the size but the contents of their hands, and tailor offers to players in order to encourage particular swaps.  (3+1+3) (3 plays)

This can be a very unforgiving game if you get short on cards, and don't draw a good card (3 camels usually works) to get back up in the turn order.  This is probably avoidable with the right strategy in the early game though.

My Philly friends love this and call it Camelpalooza.  It would be a totally unremarkable game were it not for the bidding mechanism that also involves a heavy dose of push-your-luck.

There's a very pleasing mix of mechanisms in this game that plays smoothly and fast. The decks of cards as resource management is clever as is the changing player order based on how good your offers are.

I have only played this game three times, so don't weigh this review very heavily, but neither experience was very engaging for me.  The theme is very abstract and the main scoring engine is not very interesting (try to keep your scoring tiles and the modifiers as equal as possible).  The saving grace of the game is the interesting bribe mechanism.  Unfortunately, it is not enough to make me want to play the game again without strong encouragement.

The strange bidding mechanism seems like it should work but for some reason it does not with the groups I have so far played it with. My wife refuses to play it any more and one other group I play with makes hissing noises every time I suggest we play it. The game itself seems overly mechanical and is not helped greatly by the very thin theme. I still have not given up on it but I am having trouble finding any one who will play it with me.

Oasis is an old Alan Moon game I had been hunting down for a long time. It has a truly great turn order/card bidding system which is the key interesting feature of the game. The bits you are bidding for, which are tiles or score multipliers, are less interesting. So here we have a tense tile acquisition process attached to a rather average tile laying area majority mechanic. We played with 5 and it definitely requires 5 to play well.

Régi játékom, annak idején sokat játszottunk vele, s ahhoz képest, h mi fordítottuk a szabályát 1 apró, de lényeges részt a játékból kihagytunk - a nemes plusz akcióját a kör végén-, ettől picit talán kiegyensúlyozottabb a játék, de továbbra is szerencsefüggő igencsak.

From hearing the explanation I'd tell you that this game would play terrible, but the actual gameplay is actually a lot better than the description lets on. Still, by the end of the game, I was a little disappointed about how the game plays out. From a design standpoint, the 4th and 5th players are put out in the desert (zing!) on the first turn as they have two choices. Turn over a lot of cards, that will entice someone to pick you earlier, but from there you'll have less cards to turn in the future; or don't turn over a lot of cards, ensuring you'll stay in close to last. I find it surprising the last few players aren't compensated in some fashion, why not an extra card for 4th and maybe 2 extra for 5th?

Still, I was happy to see a lot of players, well actually everyone but me, think that this game is worthwhile. Considering the differing playstyles of group members I'm impressed. For that factor alone, I would not veto this game if it were to hit the table again.

[3 plays] Just played this for the second time, and spent the evening trying to articulate to myself just why this game was unpleasant. It's a blocking, thwarting game where others are constantly crushing your plans, so in that way it feels like things move quickly, but at the same time it feels excruciatingly slow. There's downtime while you're waiting for others to do stuff, little opportunity for constructive planning, but it's stressful because you're waiting to see what they're going to ruin for you. 
I think the combination of randomness and indirection here was also not great for me. You can sacrifice to set yourself up to be in a position to get something good, but then maybe nothing good will be available that round. It's too Rube Goldbergy, with too many levers between you and the thing you actually want to happen. 
I would rather not.

I liked the way the trade offers required you to balance several goals while not being able to predict exactly how they would come out, but the map-building portion had a flat dullness.  The system mechanics work well and I would give it another play.  Perhaps experience would show more to it than just another medium-short card-drafting tile-laying game. A red flag is how few 10's this game has.  Everybody thinks its OK, which is pretty much how I felt too.

Interesting game but with problems. The game turns on the multipliers, the carpets, oovos etc. Getting these early means you can build the type of holding you want. I played badly and got hosed, but I didn't like the random card deal when making offers. I felt I had no control and when I had #1 or #2, nobody offered me anything worth having. We struggled slightly to interpret the board markings, and the rules seem to have an illegal example. But...loverly camels! Another meeple enters the world. Maybe I'll buy, maybe not.

Played 10+ times, with 4 & 5 players. On one hand, it is a lot like New England, but in a good way, for I like Oasis quite a bit better -- still, a lot in common: simple tile-laying space claiming game, tad repetitive. What I like better is the Andromedesque card auction, which I like a lot (both in Andromeda and Oasis.) The non-gamers I have been playing it with seemed to enjoy it very much. It's a tad on the simplistic side, but plays very quickly and sparks interest from casual players -- and that is worth something. [f]

I think I like this game way more than anyone who plays with me.  The mechanics of the game are so clever -- the cards you have you don't get to keep -- you have to offer them to others.  Make the best offer, and get to choose first next turn.  But when you make a good offer, other players get good stuff!!  It's a mental struggle to try to balance that.  The bits and variety of stuff in play make this game one of the best.

While the offering system here is quite interesting, it is pretty much the only interesting part of the game. And unfortunately, it also is a bit flawed as I find the luck of what cards you have in your offer pile can greatly swing the game.  I really enjoy this idea of a game where you offer incentives to your fellow players and get to benefit from them, but you don't want to benefit your opponent too much. San Marco is the better game in this regard.  Oasis is different enough that it is a different game than others from Alan Moon, but take away the offer system and you have a standard area control game that isn't very interesting to think about.  Plus, decisions on what offer to take are either elementary or forced.  Thus, I was happy to play it the once but have no desire to try again.

From Mike Kragen 8/14/08. Enjoyed first play, as well as a first play can be enjoyed when no one knows the rules or has played the game before. Barb came from way behind to win! Another effort with a 4 person game. Barb won again using the same strategy and we didn't even realize it. Got to pay more attention!

RATING: 9
(as of October 2004, January 2005) One of my favorites, and an excellent family game. I think it uses some intriguing mechanics. A player may start off slow and win big. It's not obvious who the winner is until the final score counting is done.

May 2009 -- This is still a fun game. I wish it accommodated six players; if it did, I think we would play it more often. But, I don't see a way to expand it beyond five players.

October 2011 -- This is a fun game, and we enjoy playing it when we have less than 6 players at the table. I think it is an excellent game for exactly 5 players.

2013-November: I still consider this to be a very good game for 5 players, and will play it anytime we can.

Not a bad game that came out around the time of New England.  I like making blind offers to the other players for turn order in this game.  There is a nice press your luck sort of tension with this especially since you want to  be first in turn order, but at the same time, you hate to offer too much that can be used against you.  With 3 players there seems to be room for everyone to expand.  The downside for me with this game is that I think you really need 5 players for this one.

RATING: 4
It has a novel mechanic, in which players offer one to three cards to the others, but it does not really work well, because cards are just flipped randomly. Choosing which cards to offer might improve it, but it would have the problem of players holding the best cards forever, and I suppose that was the reason the designers opted for random drawing. In the end, it is a very simple game of placing tiles and taking scoring tokens to multiply their value. Pretty basic choices and blocking tactics don't overcome the high luck factor. I'm surprised this game isn't rated lower.

After 2 plays, very much in demand among our group.  A game that rewards players with a prior play or two under their belt.  The multiplier aspect is good and means that you can take a few different strategies to victory; do you go for all one type of tile-multiplier combination and get one huge score (while neglecting others), or do you try to keep an even spread and hope to get one or two bigger ones which will propel you to victory.

Geez, I hate to rate this so low.  The auction mechanism is innovative and cool, the turn order mechanism is innovative and cool.

The game is dryer than the desert with no theme, and the area control/lay tiles/score victory points thing is overdone in every way.  Totally anticlimactic and subject to runaway winners.  But it had a couple really good mechanisms!

Edit: bumping up to 6 because of potential.  It isn't so bad!  The auction and turn order stuff is great, its the rest of the game that is just weak.

Very good game with a lot of options to gain points. In our game it was very difficult for me to get the tiles needed to score well. It's tough to decide where to cut off your offers, and at times I thought I had it locked up on what someone would choose. But since the multiplier tiles are hidden, you can never really know unless you pay an inordinate amount of attention to everything people acquire in the game.

[Initial Impression: 8]
Oasis is an area-control game with an odd, but interesting and even elegant, auction mechanism at its heart.  On each turn, players make "offers" that consist of 1, 2, or 3 cards blindly drawn from a small personal deck.  Once all offers are on the table, players select an offer (not their own) in turn order - the twist is that they must then give their turn order position marker to the player whose offer they chose.  This means it is important to make a good offer now so that you'll be able to choose a better offer on the next turn.  Providing even more incentive to make a good offer, the player who receives the marker from the first player gets a free action on that turn.  This all means that it becomes necessary to actually help other players (by making a good offer) in order to help yourself achieve a good position.  In our group, there is quite a lot of table-talk and interaction as players try to convince others that their offer is the best available.  In another twist, you only score with areas that you control if you also possess one or more multiplier tokens.  Your vast desert empire can be completely worthless if you are unable to ever win an offer for a multiplier of that terrain type.  There is quite a bit of strategy in trying to select offers that will set you up to score well, but sometimes you must choose between building up a larger and larger area or locking in a score on an area.  Once you understand the auction, this game is quite a lot of fun.  It is sometimes possible to be hurt by poor card draws, but good management of your offers over a series of turns can usually overcome this.

RATING: 10
Best played with 5. In fact, our group will not play unless there are exactly 5 players. This game has the best balance of simplicity of play, with a profound sense of strategy with the card offers. I still can't figure this one out, but am always coming back to it to try.

Update-Introduced a boardgaming newbie to this game tonight, along with several others who had never played this before. Easy to learn, fast to play, and fun enough to serve as a very good gateway for non-gamers. The "offering" game mechanic is so bizarre that there is no context for it, however it is novel enough to be interesting for new players and old alike. I'm surprised that it is still so underrated, but that it works best for five and only five may be a handicap. Still, a wonderful and unique game.

Update (07/05/09): This game is getting a well deserved resurgence in our local boardgame meetup. Several players have picked it up (and it is so cheap) since my introducing it, and they're hooked. Like poker, making offers is more of an art in understanding players' motivations, and adjusting your offers (and table talk) to manipulating them into either picking your offer, or going after someone else's offer, and thus saving the offer you really want for yourself. Of course, one must balance present offers against future offers, due to the depth of your offer deck, as well as going after the coveted #1 token.

Update (07/25/09) 13 plays: Reluctantly tried a 4P game, and was pleasantly surprised. The offer-bid mechanic is a bit more predictable, but the outcomes are not necessarily  guaranteed. Play of tiles and camels is more expansive, since there is one less player getting in the way, and hence multipliers are not as important (or maybe they are!) as the 5P game. Clearly, the 4P and 5P games feel different, but this not necessarily a bad thing--they're just different. The 5P game seems to take more finesse, while the 4P may be more prone to being determined by the luck of the draw for offers. It boils down to personal taste. 3P is still to be avoided.

Update (08/02/09) 15 plays: There are times when one must contemplate defensive (and spiteful) moves to prevent another opponent from gaining a ton of points. However, turnabout is fair play--the one you mess with now, will surely mess with you later. Oasis is about psychology, and if you piss-off one of your neighbors, either by you taking an offer they really want, but you have no use for, or encroaching upon their territories, they will remember, and surely pay you back in full. Then you both lose. Interesting. I am upping this to a light-medium game. Simple play, but plays more like poker.

Update (06/18/10): Everybody in my gaming group knows this, so we can whip it out and play it quickly in 90 minutes, whether we have 4 or 5 players. Great game with long staying power.

Update (12/30/11) 28 plays: Hadn't played this in awhile, but still is great fun. Having a lot of multipliers doesn't automatically give one the win; they must have presence on the board too. I think I'm becoming aware of yet another layer of strategy regarding offer preferences--I ignored a very favorable offer for the long-term (camel multipliers) and instead opted for a short-term gain. Another player ended up taking the camel multipliers, but he hadn't placed enough camels, so I wasn't worried. It is really about min-maxing your points relative to everyone else when considering offers.

Update (10/14/2013) 42 plays: This is a great game. There is nothing quite like it, and quite enjoyable whether it is 4-players or 5-players. It is no accident that the designers Alan R. Moon and Aaron Weissblaum also designed San Marco, another evidence of their genius. Both games delve marvelously into the psychology of offering the right amount of incentive to other players balanced against one's own selfish interest. It is still a "10".

A light set collection game with multiplier scoring. There's quite a bit of luck in the 'offering' mechanism, you can't choose which cards come off your deck, and once your deck gets depleted you can be stuck at the back of the turn order with no way back. Of Alan Moon's games, San Marco is probably better, even if I don't enjoy it personally.

Another grossly overated Moon game with nothing interesting to offer and too much luck. 

It felt a little like San Marco and Capitol mixed together but more like the latter. With 3 people the auction/card flip mechanism felt a little like San Marco, two people try to make the number one player a better offer and then he decides between the two (different but kinda of the same too), this DID NOT work well at all and its easily possible to exhaust your card pile as well. Capitol like qualities in how the board is laid out and then you really rely on cards to get you into areas you need to be in. Flipping 1 to 3 cards borrowed from Medici, it works here but the replenish scheme ensures you have little control. Also, it might look like TTD but it is not at all and TTD has strategy and no luck, this has too much luck and no strategy.

Comparisons to his and other games aside this stands on its own albeit not very well. There is too much luck in the card draw (as usual in his games) and there is NO STRATEGY AT ALL (also typical), you have no way to plan ahead as you never know what cards will be available or what scoring multipliers you will end up with. On top of this, 4 or 5 players will ensure too much randomness in how the auction plays out so control over your own fate becomes minimal. A much more interesting way to play would be to have your offer cards in your hand, more control, tougher choices.

Just to re-iterate, too much luck, no strategy, 3-4-5 all bad player numbers (4 & 5 random and 3 the auction is almost broken so 4 or 5 works better), and too long for this type of game. Another title suited for family/gateway play but there are much better games for that niche.

This game makes me feel like a MONGOLIAN WARLORD!

The most common criticism that I've heard for this game is that it is too abstract. Well, I love abstracts, so that's no deterrent for me. Here's the scoop:

The game has no depth, it is entirely tactical. Do the best with what you'v been offered. This game seems to have been designed specifically as a light closer for 5-player game nights and it fits that role rather well. We enjoy egging each other on to make bigger offers. It's a neat little interactive game if you keep your expectations low and aren't too frustrated by the lack of real decisions.

Bought this game on a whim - also on sale. I was quite suprised! This game is fun (especially having the right group when bidding) and I also use this game as an intro to non games.

This is another where I feel like saying "let's play again" as soon as it ends. Great desert theme, fun bidding mechanism for future turn order.

OOP.

Updated rating from 9.2 to 9.5.  This is really a spectacular game.  Agonizing decisions due to having to balance offering cards, drawing cards, what your picking order will be, plus all of the spatial maneuvering going on.  And top quality production.  With 5, I don't see ever getting tired of this game, definitely a keeper in my collection.

Oasis could easily have been part of the GIPF project. When I sat down to learn it, the guy explaining the game immediately started talking about "contiguous groups" and "multipliers." After 30 seconds or so, I asked what the game was about, just so I had a way to approach it (I HATE HATE HATE games explanations that amount to "you're trying to get points and you do it by...[abstract mechanisms X, Y, and Z]"). He misunderstood my question and kept explaining in the abstract. Or so I thought. Really, this game is about contiguous tile groups and multipliers. It seems well designed if abstract spatial games are your sort of thing.

RATING: 7.5
You make offers with your cards to the other players to try to move higher in the player order. If you are higher in the player order you have a better chance of selecting the items you want. Select terrain tiles, camels, or multipliers to get points. This is a fun interactive game requiring you to think about what the other players want, but trying not to give them too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
On the second time around it occurred to me that it's sort of an auction game where you neither know what you're bidding for nor what you're bidding.

This is a key frustration.  One turn you can see cool stuff you want, but the turn order was already set - there's nothing you can do.  Then you bid high, only to discover that next turn, you don't see anything you really need.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Works for me.  Simple auction mechanic; simple tile laying; simple scoring.  More depth than you'd think -- but it plays quickly.  What's not to like? Oh, the lame "theme"?  This might have been better as an abstract (like Igenious) rather than trying to copy the "In the Desert" motif...

I got the rules wrong once and played that each player [i]looked[/i] at his or her "hand" and selected cards to offer. This turned out to be a big improvement to the game; replacing a push-your-luck element with a tactical decision of how-much-do-I-help-my-opponent-in-order-to-advance-my-own-position?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Completely abstract set collecting game that reminds me of other Alan Moon/Aaron Weissblum designs like Andromeda (in the trading aspect) and others.  I'm usually not a big fan of tile laying games, but this one is more of a stock game.  It plays quickly and can get a little aggressive when players cut each other off.   It's fun!

RATING: 7
Fast to learn and play. Though a Eurogame (bidding element known as offering and has ways to screw people), it [b]allows beginners to pick up [/b]strategy quickly. I like it for the strategy of offering a lot to be first or being cheap and building up your offering deck. Simple yet playable. A great game, but I'm [b]left with the feeling that it feels like a filler. [/b]Probably because I would rather play more complex games.

There are some interesting ideas here. I like the bidding and the turn order trade-offs. I suspect that it might have just a little too much luck to make it sufficienctly strategic to hold my interest but I have only played it once and I am willing to play it again to find out.

Will play more; very enjoyable and simple to learn.  Strategy seems underlying as I need to figure out the offer/accept strategy and how/when to attempt to block oponnents off on their plots and camel paths.
I really like this one for a tweener game...in the middle of lite and intense thinking.
I also play with the printed/intended rules, hidden scorers, hidden offer stack, etc.
I think the game does what the designers intended, a fun game with a bit of strategy and thought splashed in.

RATING: 5
After many plays, I have decided that there is WAY too much luck in the cards you have to flip. I also think the bonus action of being first is way too powerful for being a "luck" driven card game. The bonus of being number 1 should just be getting the ablity to go first. I have played too many games where 1 lucky person gets the bonus action 4 or 5 times, while an unlucky person doesn't get it at all. I have knocked my rating down farther each time I've played - from an original 9 to my final 5.

This game is predictable later in the game what people are going to choose, which could make the game more interesting if players had a chance to choose which cards were offered, but it wouldn't work.  I'd like to see based on the average spot in the turn order I received the entire game how that impacted my final score; basically, what place I came in.  Not crazy about this game and glad I passed it up on Tanga quite a few times.

At first it seemed a bit dry, but that was just the initial problems with the rules...once we got past trying to figure out *what* to do, we could look at *why* we were doing it.  Then it turned in to a nasty little game of cut-off and points mashing.  Quite a decent game.

Another elegant Moon design. I really like the auction element of this, but it didn't play out as well with just 3. The tile laying is nice, but nothing too new. I would have enjoyed this a lot more when it first came out, but it's over a decade and now and just okay. Plays fairly quickly.

The offering piles of cards mechanic is a novel idea, but just does not grab me.  The tile placement does not seem very strategic -- it's usually possible to place your tiles and camels somewhere useful without being blocked even in a four-player game.

This game works best with 5, but I think for 4 as well, it's a good trading and resource management game, with an interesting balance of different characters that give the players different benefits.

A real surprise. Bought it in Dallas at a store that's now out of business, marked down to 19.95. First game I bought with an offering, auction engine. Camel meeples are different. There's some math involved at the end. You don't know who's winning because of the multipliers being secret. People like this one. I'm the only one I know who's even heard of it.

Played once, 5p.  WTF?  This game was bad.  Normally, I don't automatically think a game is bad if I lose badly, but this was a complete waste of time.  No strategy can withstand the turn of the cards.  There are MUCH better games than this in this same genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beautiful production quality and good working blend of art with game components.  One of the very few blind-bidding games that I enjoy.  Oasis is unique on it's own merits tho it somewhat reminds me of elements seen in Thru the Desert and New England.  Oasis has a fresh new bid/offer mechanic idea that is the central feature of the game.  The game combines:  blind "offerings" (where the randomness lies), tile-laying board tactics and "paired" set collection ideas smoothly, without making rules difficult.  From my experiences with the game, all these elements are important but none are singularly supreme.  Could be played either with "hidden" score markers, or with "open" score markers.  I've played it both methods, and either way works tho I tend to favor Open scoring more.  Open scoring works very well as it eliminates memorization and IMO create better five player games as people tend to see runaway collections more clearly.  I can think of another variant that might work favorably as well...  I propose this Bohnanza variant: where players are allowed to see their own cards in hand (a la Bohnanza) but CANNOT change or alter the sequence in which they receive them), and thus must make offerings according to the original rules (with the only difference it's not "blind" offerings).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Simple auction game where one seeks to monopolize on a couple different sets of ways to score.  Scoring tiles are multiplied by region tiles to gain total score for 4 seperate sets.

RATING: 8
Relatively simple tile laying game which offers some interesting twists on fairly familiar mechanics.  The decision of which stack of cards to pick is the heart of the game but the strategic placement of the pieces also offers some opportunities for clever play.  Plays best with 5.

At first I wasn't sure if this game would get continued play but after the first play we loved it. There is a good bit of strategy and a very unique way of turn order and card usage that I really like. Its a good mix of strategy, area-of-control, and some resource management (mainly board space). You can even screw your neighbor at times. This game will definitely get more play.

Read the reviews & comments before playing and I can see why you wouldn't want to play this with 3.  But the game is notable for having virtually no downtime.  Maybe some of the best player interaction I've seen in a game.  It packs a pretty solid gaming experience into under an hour, not unlike 7 Wonders, in its way.  I wish the game was a little prettier... seems like it could've been.  By the same token, there's something dry about it... the design is somewhat better than the execution, which isn't bad, just a little dull.

Oh, the humanity!  

This game has a tile/camel placement mechanic that I really like, but it is driven by a card bidding mechanism without any real control over what you offer.  This makes the game too luck dependent.  If you can't come up with a set of cards that someone really wants, you almost never get to be first, but you have no way of deciding to offer something people want.  It makes the bidding like Nicht die Bohne with random cards played from the hand.  Bleh.

Solid placement game with multiple scoring opportunities and some similarities to Through the Desert.  I enjoyed the semi-blind offering process where players offer up to 3-cards by flipping one at a time and then deciding whether to flip up another (you don't know what the cards are) or to stop.  Whoever made the best offer (or actually the first offer taken) in the last round picks first.  This reminded me of Knizia again, Money!  The mechanics are light but the board does eventually fill up quickly and there are plenty of defensive and offensive decisions to make.

I might be sold on the multiplier-vs-size-with-blocking aspect alone, but the card play with its risk management and barter power aspect is pretty clever. A run of bad luck can lock a player in last position with nothing to offer (and thus nothing to gain) but let's hope that's rare.

One play does not a basis for evaluation make ... but I didn't like the narrow range of actions based on face-up cards. My first play was with a full set of 5 players, and yet I had very thin offers every turn, and didn't see board tiles very often.

Second play: the above didn't happen to me, but it did happen to another player. You can get mired down with the "5" marker and just never get the tiles you want. I've not yet figured out the best way out of that hole.

Okay, after a few more plays this game has grown on me quite a bit more. The trick is that you have to get focused early on what you think you can achieve, and not get distracted by good offers which don't help you directly, versus mediocre offers that bring you some direct benefits. Previously, not a favorite of mine, but now very much recommended.

Oasis is a weird reverse blind-bidding game [you know how much everyone else has bid, but you can't know how much you're going to bid] coupled with a tile-laying blocking game akin to something like Through the Desert, New England, or Attika [come to think of it, Guatemala Cafe, Hacienda, and Key Harvest also fall into this category].

And, although it has camels, it's not set in the Middle / Near East. How many games can you say that about? I'd like to try the open-hand variant, which would remove the blind-bidding aspect while adding a lot more analysis. I suspect this would reinvigorate this game which I haven't played in quite awhile.

Have played enough to know it is a solid game and challenging enough...the luck element can kill your game but is infrequent enought that it doesn't spoil the game...multiplier tiles are the key to winning and not running out of cards is also important.

RATING: 7
Player turn order disks from 1 to 5 are dealt out. Players "offer" cards to opponents. Player with disk 1 gets first choice of cards and gets to use those actions on the cards. Player whose offer was taken gets '1' disk for next round. Turn continues in similar fashion in disk order. Placement of tiles is similar to New England. Scores are your tiles multiplied by the number of scoring mulitpliers for each terrain you have accumulated. It's okay, but there is no control over what you have as offer cards, and very opportunistic if good cards get flipped up before you can take them. But this is balanced by simple mechanics and some tough decision making such as how many cards to offer to opponents.

Mildly nasty area control game that moves at a good pace.  Save your whining for the end of the game, because last-minute comebacks and surprise victories can occur with little difficulty.  At a glance, the fact that you don't know what cards you'll be offering seems silly.  But, if it were otherwise, the game would be a dull, grindingly analytical affair.

Very interesting. My initial play was with 3 players. This is probably not the best way to play this game (5 is most likely best with 4 being acceptable) but even so, I could see the great potential here. As Alan Moon said, this is the first game he and Aaron Weissblum worked on, and you can see how many of the ideas went on to inhabit their other games. I look forward to many more playings of this! ****UPDATE*** Several more playings reveal the heavy luck element in the game. I still enjoy the game, but no longer consider it a game that can be taken too seriously. ***UPDATE 6/18/04*** The rating just keeps going down with each time I play.

RATING: 7
First impression (5 players): The game left me with some mixed feelings. I like the mechanics but there were some small issues with them. 

The two main parts of the game are first choosing how many action cards you'll reveal. Then in second part players will choose who will do what actions. The player gives his position (for the next round) to the player he chose actions from and does the actions.

With their actions players must balance between building 4 different scoring categories or taking score-multipliers for those categories. And when without any multipliers they start from 0 you really would like to have them! You can either try to specialize or go with a bit more balanced approach. Either can work depending how the action cards are divided. I like this balancing between trying to risk (taking a lots of tiles without multipliers) or playing safe. 

My main issue with the game comes from selecting sets of action cards. It's both important to get an earlier turn on next round (usually by having attractive set of action cards) and getting good fitting set of cards to yourself on this turn. First one you can achieve by either getting lucky with the cards or by playing more of them. Problem here is that sometimes a set of 3 cards can be about equally attractive to just one good card. Naturally 3 should be clearly better most of the time. 

You don't quite have enough room to manouver with cards. One more card or not? One card more is quite expensive move for you especially if it doesn't give you better position. I was left with a feeling that your next turns position is controlled a bit too much by luck of draw (your action cards) and other players choices (which you cannot know for sure). As position is one of the most important thing in game it feels a bit wrong that you don't have more control over it.

After all this ranting I must admit that Oasis is really a fun game and felt good to play it. 

Update (3.10.2010) : We played with a variant that you see your cards but cannot rearrange them (as in Bohnanza) so you can plan to some extend when to leave a good card in reserve for next round and have a better offer then. I was surprised that this might actually made game faster instead of slower that you'd think. But it also made me realize that even like this you cannot plan too much ahead as you cannot be certain who has "1."-token the next round and you would like to have best offering specifically to that player. Therefore the game felt again in a bit wrong way to be a bit too much about having wrong cards. Either that or I just suck badly in this game... :-)

I still would recommend to try this variant as it made slightly better IMHO.

Ambientazione simpatica (cammellini, oasi) che ricorda Nel Deserto di Knizia, e come il gioco di Knizia l'ambientazione è decisamente casuale visto che siamo di fronte ad un classico astrattone. Le meccaniche sono immediate ma non banali; il gioco risulta un po' ripetitivo e poco coinvolgente. Strategicamente reputo le tessere rettangolari di valore molto superiore a quelle di piazzamento quadrate, così come credo che diversificare le proprie tessere sia un errore.

This is a good solid offering. Light middle in complexity. There is lots of room for strategy... you may not always get the offer you want, but there is usually something beneficial you can do with the offer you do receive. I like the way you can try and box players in with a careful stoney tile or two, or with your careful placements of camels. Not as good with three players though.

RATING: 6
A 60 min luck-fest. Either the cards you want come up when you're in a position to pick them, or not. And either you get cards that allow you to attract first pick or not. Too much luck for me. There are 2 decisions each turn - whether playing another card will likely get you picked earlier, and which collection will score you more points. The first is a guess, the second is usually obvious. The game is improved somewhat by playing a variant where you pick the top 2 cards from your deck and choose which to play, but in feel it's the same.

This is a fine game.  It flows quickly, and is easy to teach to newbies.  The theme, by all accounts, is definitely dry, but the wooden camels make up for this somewhat.  The offerings are the trickiest and most interesting part of the game.  I see no problem with the "randomness" of the cards.  Sure, you can't choose which cards to offer, but you can determine how many you want to offer each time.  Thus, you can conserve your cards, choosing not to be competitive, or go for broke in a hope of becoming the first player.  Also, there are times when going for the #1 isn't as important as keeping the #1 from getting anything.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable game that is easy to learn and play. Bidding for cards that yield the 8 possible scoring components has twists affecting turn order, bonuses, and replenishments of cards.  Cards are always unknown to all players until revealed in the bidding phase. Scoring is by the sum of multiplicative combinations of four sets of complementary components. Scoring is only done at the end of the game.

Competition for space on the board is not particluarly fierce with three players. Bidding choices and tile placement are fairly obvious too. I expect the four and five (which may be too many) player games to be more intense in all aspect including 'screwage'.

If the odds aren't against you there's a pretty good tile placement game in there.  Unfortunately you have to hope the cards you draw are the ones specific opponents want.  

You can spend all your cards trying to get out of the last or second to last positions, but if the players who are going first don't need or want what you have to offer you can do nothing but keep getting beat down.

Almost an awesome game.

Too fiddly (cards being flipped and gathered all over the place, lots and lots of cardboard) considering how light this is. At 3, gets repetitive fast. I'm assuming it's at its best at 5? Perhaps a smaller alternative board for lower player counts is the fix it needs.

Oasis was a very enjoyable game to play.  This game is one of those games you don't know who is winning until the very end and you begin adding up the scores.  This also means that a person who has played the game before will have a definite advantage over most people who have never played before.  The key is the multipliers.  Whenever an opportunity to get a multiplier comes up take it.

While the game has a luck factor with the turning of the cards, It gets turned into your strategy. The three player game is a little unbalanced in that there is a high chance that there is a 50% chance that the 2nd and 3rd players don't get a choice of what cards they get.

I like the game and this will likely see more play.

Interesting mix of area control & multiplier scoring.

Offer 1,2, or 3 cards (land tiles, camels, or multipliers), make your choice of the offers in number order (can't take your own unless it's the only one left), be rewarded for being the first offer picked by getting to choose first in the next round & getting a bonus land tile or camel.

Be careful with generous offers as the bigger your offer the less replacement cards you get, leaving you restricted for the next round.

Large area/camel control is good but remember, it's worth nothing without the multipliers!

Never sure who's gonna come away with the victory until right at the end.

Good fun.

This is played quite frequently at my local games club, but for some reason I'd managed to avoid playing it until July 2015.

I particularly like the mechanic whereby you decide how good an "offering" you should make to the other players, with considerable incentives to offer things which they actually want.

I won't want to play this all the time, by any means, but with an hour or so to fill I doubt I'd be saying no.

based on one play.  on the surface, it seems like a typical bidding type of game, but the designers have managed to put something special behind it.  It's a much more 'human' game than most cold calculational bidding games.  every move you make has the potential to make other players happy/sad, and you have to be able to read people's situations and preferences.  i know this is true for most bidding games, but i think the effect is more pronounced in this game.  in particular, the ability to make people happy with your choice (for example, having your offer chosen by #1 is a great feeling) is something largely absent from most bidding games, which foster a much more competitive and lonely atmosphere.  moves are quick and need only a bit of thought.  my one quibble is that the map feel incongruous--why are the camels and their habitat so wholly separated from the rest of the game?  it seems kind of stapled on.  if it weren't for that fact, the game would be much more elegant.

Multiple goals and options offset by a blind luck offer of cards.  Need to balance how much to offer, but no real control other than number.  At its heart an auction game where one is at the will of other's desire to take what you offer.

Our first playing was with holdings open...I did enjoy this "accidental" variant and would suggest it as the only way to play the game.  If nothing else, it provides information about your offers.

I don't know whether the game would be improved by adding more players, but it lacked a little something with three.  There was some interest in managing the size of your draw pile (basically deciding when to make a move for first position), but not a ton, and there seemed a lot of dice luck.  I think it would be more interesting if the offers were made from some sort of hand of cards, so you could make more deliberate choices in trying to present tempting trade targets.

Oasis is a game of area control with an orthogonal tile/cameeple spacial element. Combine that with scoring multipliers that everyone competes for, a unique approach to turn order action-selection, and you've got yourself a simple but interesting filler length game from Alan Moon.

Choices aren't excruciating, but a sharp eye is required to figure out which options are going to net you the most points. Since so many points can be racked up by scoring multipliers, it's prudent to focus on 1 or 2 categories. Extending for 3 or more will lead to spectacular failure.

The components are excellent, and the art is good. An enjoyable little game.

Excellent multi tiered area control game.  I like the "auction" card offering mechanic.

Got in 2007

Strategy - If the other players let you run away with the camels then do it.  Camels are big points.  Try to get as many multiplier tiles as possible and load up on one kind resource.

The game is ok.  The grouping mechanics are fun and as the game plays out spaces get tight.  However, I think that the game is weakened in a major way by the unknown hand cards.  I can see no reason why this game wouldn't be far superior with open hands.  Better strategies and options would be available.  As it stands, I don't think that I'de play this one unless we used open hands.

A fun middle-weight game, with just the right amount of "stuff" to think about.  While there's a bit too much luck in the blind offerings, there is still some good angsting over whether to turn over just one more card when making an offer.

A territory control game with an interesting mechanic for choosing actions. Everyone puts up a set of action cards to take, and whoever's cards are chosen first gets first choice next time. So you can try to entice the other players by putting up good cards, unless you'd rather conserve them for later and hope for decent last choice cards in the current round. But that's about the only exciting thing to say about this game.

Oasis...this game I loved upon first play, but then steadily grew to not like.  It feels a bit too random for my tastes.  If you got to look at the cards you played out instead of just peeling them off the top, I might feel different.  I think it would take some house rules for this game to really shine.

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable area control game with a novel gift-giving 'auction' mechanic. The Mongolian theme is very nicely applied (except, frustratingly enough, in the title). High production values, particularly with the inclusion of cameeples! Seems to be widely available at a discount - strongly recommended. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The significant fluctuations in card values turns this into a game with just too much luck for me with the rules as written. For a blind draw mechanism like this one the card values would have to be closer, and that's problematic itself with players having invested in different point scoring areas. I mean, 30 point swings on a lucky flip of a card is too much of a game breaker in my book. I'd like to try the game where players could choose which cards they'd like to offer from what they have in hand, or be able to choose from the top two - at least that would bring the brain engagement up a notch and perhaps the luck down a little.

RATING: 6
Another area control Euro that works quite ok.  Its major flaw is that the gameplay depends on other people picking players' offers, which can lead to kingmaking situations and other kind of motivations different to fair play to chose one set or another.  In this way, it is very similar to [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=161&Itemid=1]Santiago[/url][/i], another nice game that is not of my total liking for similar reasons.

The very definition of a euro-game.  Quick to teach, quick to play, elegant mechanics (with interesting interplay between mechanics), attractive components, satisfying depth, but not a brain-drain.

From eknauer's comments: "...with a fun bidding mechanic resembling the one found in Medici in that you flip over cards for other players to bid on and stop when you think the offer is attractive enough (if your offer is chosen first, you get an extra action as a reward and get first choice of offers during the next round)."

Jason Little (ynnen) wrote:"...it feels you can be done in by luck of the draw (yours or your opponents') ...especially if your one card offer is exactly what the 1st selector needs for a huge score."  True, but oh is it fun to be the 1st selector in those situations!

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

That clever offer-selection/turn order mechanic.  Most of the time, I find that I choose the offer which will provide resources most likely to mesh with my plans, but sometimes I choose based on how turn order will be influenced.

Nice game, good first impression and rating might rise.  A little bit of randomness introduced by you not knowing what you will be offering your fellow players, but still an interesting mechanic and a nice light exercize in maximizing your points return without letting anyone else have too free of a time with their own expansion.  Would have liked a bit more contrast between 'base board' and the bonus yellow square, but that is a minor complaint.

Initial impressions were that this is just a passable game. However, I played with three players. Ratings may increase after additional games.
'Oasis' should not be played with three players as it removes a significant

RATING: 7
Offering, Set Collection, Majority Scoring. Interesting game with multiplicative scoring among sets of resources; making better offers to other players will get you better turn order, but helps opponents and depletes your hand. Reminiscent of San Marco's pie-dividing mechanic. I like it.

Finally got a copy. It sat on my shelf for a year or two, then I got the guys to try it at lunch and they were lukewarm on it. After another year on the shelf I traded it away.

RATING: 8.5
Wow, there is quite a bit more to this game than I initially thought.  Oasis goes nicely in the progression that Moon and Weisblum had been developing.  There are some elements of New England (the placement), but really it fits well with San Marco's I divide what cards you will pick from, to Mammoth Hunters I give you the card to play on your turn.  Now it is I flip the cards that you can chose.

In the rules it states that you play with closed holdings, but I feel that this game is best suited knowing what your opponents are working for.  This leads to a number of tough decisions to make.  

Really, for turning over cards randomly, there are a number of considerations to keep in mind: the current turn order, the turn order to come, your stock, the players that are vying for the same position as you in relation to your order, and who you are giving points to.

Quite a lovely system.  I've only played this with five, and I really only plan to play this with five.  This way you get people cutting you off and conversely you push for the opportunity to block people out as well.  This game just works well.

My Tanga purchase. :-) While there are lots of components, there doesn't seem to be much to the game at first glance: short rules and a simple scoring mechanism. However, the mechanism whereby you offer scoring opportunities to your opponents is novel. I've played it once, and we all enjoyed it. Sometimes it seems like there's a bit too much luck involved, but that just increases the incentive to engineer yourself into a position where you don't need to count on luck.

Oasis is a push your luck bidding game with a map. Though the map is important for area control and scoring provided that you are playing, as you should, with the maximum 5p, the heart of the game is in the bidding mechanism. Be warned, however, that luck plays a large role in the bidding mechanism. I have concerns that the draw determines the results; there might not be much a player can do to mitigate unlucky draws early on. But it's a fun, well developed euro with a touch of nastiness, one of Alan Moon's better designs, and it's over in 45-60 minutes.

This game is a brilliant ultra tense game with a full contingent of 5--easily a 10.  But the rating falls for fewer players, and with our more typical group of 4 these days, it's only an 8.  But seriously it is one of the best with 5.  The fight to control first placement and card offers is fantastic, and unique.  If you can get five players together on anything close to a regular basis, you MUST get this game!

2015 - changing this rating to 10.  We only play with 5, so it's fair to rate it at its optimal number...just don't blame me if you don't like it as well when you play with 3 :)  But considering it's held it's own over 9 years of play in our group now, the game deserves its 10

Oasis is not a bad little abstract euro with a theme that is thinly laid up on top.  put our the a group of up to 3 cards as an offer to try to entice the other players to take your offer and give you there player round marker.  I was not enthralled in this game.  You had very little control over what to offer..... flp over your cards to see what you get to offer ..... so a push your luck element and then all you can control is to make sure your opponent does not get what he wants.  trying to get what you really want unless your 1st or second player .... which you control by random flip of yr cards is unlikely

A simple but engaging game of making offers to other players.

Area majority/tile placement Euro with a Mongolian desert theme. The aim is to place three different types of tiles and as large a group of camels onto the board as possible. These then need to match scoring tiles you have acquired in order to score victory points. To obtain the tiles/camels to play on the board as well as the scoring tiles, players make offerings of cards depicting the various tiles available. These are then selected by their opponents and to be victorious a player needs to match as high a number of scoring tiles with their largest groups of tiles laid on the board. The gameplay flows smoothly but there's too much of a random element to the offerings as you are not allowed to see the cards until they are played. I'd have preferred there to be more control over your hand management, which would have introduced several much needed layers of strategy to the game.

Desperately in need of some form of control; randomness in what you offer, chaos in which order people select the offers, and blocking on the board made for a deeply frustrating experience for most of the players at the table. That one player had invested heavily in camels, only to find he was the only one offering commodities made it both impossible to win and no fun at all. I guess this is a light family game, but it is desperately in need of some player control. 5 is also probably not the best player count.

Pretty interesting. The first time we played the person who won had an even spread of the different types of ways to score. The second time we played the person who won had only scored in two areas.

Something I should start doing more is to look for the people who have 1 or 2 and play my auction to them. If they have a large amount of camels and I flip up a camel scoring, that might be enough to get them to pick my offer. If they have one green scoring tile and someone offeres up 4 green tiles, thats 4 points. If they have 11 camels, my scoring tile is worth 11 points to them.

Each player is the head of a Mongolian family, intent on becoming the most powerful in the land. If a player Uses his resources wisely to take control of fertile steppe lands to raise horses, build sacred temples, develop caravans of camels, and control the beautiful oases, he may be anointed the Noble of the Oasis. Players begin with a small stack of cards that show pictures of a camels, stony plains, sandy steppes, oases and their corresponding goods (carpets, rocks, horses and water pools). On a player's turn, he flips 1, 2 or 3 cards as his "offering" to the other players and then draws (respectfully) 2, 1 or 0 cards blindly to add to the bottom of his stack. So, if he offers a lot of cards, he is not going to be able to fill his stack back up. Everybody does this in player order. The player with the #1 disc chooses from one of the other offers and gives that person the #1 disc. The person with the #2 disc chooses from the remaining offers and gives the #2 disc to that player. And so on. Sometimes the player with the #4 disc ends up with his own offer, but not too often as people are trying their best to get the #1 disc by making an attractive offer since the person with the #1 disc gets two advantages. First, he gets one bonus action at the end of his turn. Second, he gets first choice in the next round. Based on the cards taken during the offering round, a player may be placing camels on the camel path, placing stony plains/oasis/sandy steppe tiles on the steppes spaces or collecting the indicated goods. The game ends when the last of any given land tile runs out. Then the players multiply the number of camels in their largest camel grouping by the number of collected carpets to score some points. Similarly, a player multiplies the rocks, horses and water pools by the total number of the corresponding land tiles to get more points. The player with the most points wins the game. Seems to be a very luck-driven game with the card draws. If one continually draws the low-valued cards, nobody is going to be selecting your offering. I will have to play it one more time to see if my opinion improves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Collect tiles and score multiplier coupons and place the tiles on the board. Create large areas for maximum points. Areas belonging to a player may not be "conquered" or connected, so you can only block, not really attack. The game has a kind of auction component, because players decide how many tiles they make available for their opponents; the reward for a good offer is a good place in the turn order for the next turn. Interesting game, not too heavy but a lot of factors to think about if you want to.

RATING: 6.5
I enjoyed this game enough the first time I played it, where I lost a tie-breaker for first place, to buy it. The second time I played it, where I finished in the back of the pack, the game fell flat. But the person who won that game, which was his first playing, enjoyed it. While that seems normal enough, I am worried that your fate in Oasis depends too heavily on factors outside your control. If those factors work initially in your favor, you can get a winning rhythym going. If not, you just can't get over the hump enough to contend. More playing are obviously needed for surer analysis.

7 seems to be my default rating for games that I like but don't love.  

I thought I'd love this game, but I don't yet.  However, I have only played it twice so the rating may well go up.

Update:  I have played this 3 more times and I like it, but I am holding the rating at 7.

I think the "bidding" mechanic is cool. You keep turning up a face-down card from your pile (up to a limit) until you stop and that is your offer. The more you offer, the more likely you are to win, but you can't replenish your draw pile with as many (if any) cards. Your pile will quickly become depleted and you may not have enough to get the thing you really want when you need it. You also run the risk of overbidding, sometimes way overbidding.

It's a neat press-your-luck auction that I have not seen in another game.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Only played twice so far.  I like the theme and bits.  I haven't decided yet whether the priority exchange requires a lot of strategy or just pure luck.  Need to play a bit more and see how I feel about the game in general.  It is enjoyable, though.

This one I like a lot, although I think it needs the max of five players fighting for limited space on the board to really fullfill it's potential.

The offering mechanic SOUNDS cool -- whoever offers the best resources will become the first player next round, thus getting the first choice of the other players' offerings.  In practice, though, I just didn't see a big enough difference between being the different positions to make it worth offering very much.  (And, since the items you are offering are random draws -- you only choose whether to keep adding cards to the offering -- the actual quality of what you offer is hard to predict.)

I played this with 5 players only once, and that mechanic did seem to be more interesting that time.  But the board where you place your resources is so small that not all 5 players will be able to fit their pieces on it.  Between that and the horrible scoring system (multiplying two different variables to get your points leads to huge gaps in the score), the 5-player game felt decided when it was less than half over.

Played this with 3 players, and I've got to say that I was less than impressed.  Overall it was fun, but I found that 3 players really makes the bidding seem restricted.  My impression is that this would be a much better game with 4 or 5...the choices offered player one would be significantly greater, which would make more people vie for one of the first few spots.  Also, the gameboard would get really tight really fast, which I think would be interesting.

RATING: 7
I think the strategy of the blind offers is a lot stronger than many players are giving this game credit for. Yes, it is a little random, but if you watch the board, and keep loose track of what scoring tiles everyone takes you can make solid, trim offers that will get grabbed. Sometimes you'll get skunked playing a stinker, but it seems rare. Never let your stock dwindle down to one card. The 3 player game requires careful thought, and with more players it tends to be more chaotic, not that that's always a bad thing

Enjoyable theme and game mechanics. Quite a clever method of determining turn order and victory points. Relies on the age old multiplier cards at end game. The camels seem to be the key to this game and if you can get the right multipliers then they are truly broken.

I like the play of this one.  Neat mechanic with the dealing out cards for offers.  How badly do you want to be first player?  Only flaw I'm seeing with the game after quite a few plays now is it seems that the whoever wins the camel race wins the game.  Will need to play some more to see if I really think this but if that's the case the rating will probably drop some. 

UPDATE: A very underrated little game of nastiness that should be played by everyone! I find it quite a keen game that moves along quickly.

This Moon game reminds me somewhat of Moon's New England, probably because the tile placement rules are similar.  On the other hand, the scoring reminds me of the system used in Torres.  While this game isn't quite as good as either of those, it's a nice mixture of mechanisms that holds its own.  One reason this isn't rated higher (despite the awesome camel meeples) is that I still haven't figured out how best to manipulate the unique "offer" mechanism, where players essentially give each other the means to win, in order to get tiles and scoring chips in return.  Perhaps after a few more plays I'll have a better sense of how much to offer when.  Finally, I don't think this game works at all with only 3 players, but works pretty well with 4 or 5 players.  While I usually like games with the fewest number of players they accomodate, this one is actually better with more because there are more offers to choose from, so the whole creating offers and choosing offers part becomes more interesting when there are more out there.  Moreover, the size of the board doesn't scale, so there's more competition and interaction in the tile-laying on the board when there are more players.  I do wish the really cool camel meeples played a bigger role in the game.

Based on one play (and has nothing to do with the fact that I lost by a wide margin). The random bidding is an interesting idea, but I'm not sure it actually works as implemented here. The tile-laying part of the game doesn't seem to actually lead to any real conflict, though the camels sometimes do.

Wonders will never cease. Somebody pulled out Oasis the other day, and I didn't really want to play it but begrudgingly agreed to do so. The game sat on my shelf unplayed for years because I remembered a lot of tiles that didn't fit into plastic holders very well, and heard some players grumbled they didn't like it.

The bits are VERY NICE, the game is fun, though some players didn't like the random aspect of the player cards. I felt the game revolved around doing the best you could with whatever resources came your way. I like the way the #1 player chooses the next #1 by the quality of their offer. I like the whole theme of fitting bits on a minimal board, and also like the mechanic of the tile-type multipliers. 1, 2 or 3 cards felt kind of like Medici. A+ on the board and bits. I've always been a big fan of the many Moon and Weissblum games, and can now add this in as one of my favorites.

A forgotten game by Alan Moon.  Odd tile laying, camel herding kind of thing, where the end game scoring is just ludicrously large.  Once in a while, yes, but probably only for tile laying fans who are looking for something off the beaten path.  Definitely won't appeal to a large spectrum of gamers.

I am noy quite sure how to feel about this game. Given it is an Alan Moon game, I was somewhat excited at trying this out. With four players, I have to say that the game just does not excite me enough to play often. The biggest weakness of the game come from the scalability. I did not think that with four players, there was enough tension. Luck of the draw for your offerings is pretty much too prevalent. I could not do many things or gotten better offers enough though I put down all my cards. Often times, I feel helpless to prevent runaway situation. This is just not a terribly satisfying game overall.

When I first listened to the rules, the offer mechanism sounded kind of stupid.  What do you mean I can't look at my cards?  I have to offer cards out my "hand" without even knowing what they are?  In practice, though, it worked very well.  It adds a significant element of luck, but offers control in less than obvious ways.  All in all, I liked it, but it won't be a required puchase.

I'm glad I've only played it with five- it's clearly best that way.  I really, really like the Offering mechanic (its Nicht die Bohne, but better), but the board placement isn't quite cutthroat enough to make this a truly great game.

RATING: 6
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about this game.

A very strange game of randomly drawing actions for other players to choose from, overlaying several simultaneous games of Through the Desert. The more you offer, the better chance you'll have good actions to choose from next round... maybe? It's actually surprising that the game plays out as enjoyably as it does for all the randomness and lack of control. Playing with less than 5 might make the game more controllable, but then the board would be too big and the positional play would be pointless. I'm also pretty wary of multiplicative scoring. It takes a while to overcome my innate distrust. Maybe always being able to look at the top card of your draw stack might give you more control without making the game too heavily analytical, but maybe not.

After 2 plays. It is an ok game but there seems to be some tension missing. I have played both games with 4 players so that may be it. I think adding a 5th would definitely be well worth it.

07/04/13 - Played it with 5 and it was *much* better. There is more tension for the #1 disc. 1st place in this last game was at 116 points and three of us duked it out for 2nd with 68,69 and 70 points. That was quite tight.  With 4, it is about 6.75 and with the full 5 it will go up to a 7 and possibly a 7.25.

This is a tile-laying, area-control game with a desert theme.

This game seemed pleasant enough for my only play until I found out that one player couldn't implement his strategy of spreading himself around, so he focused on one tile type.  He ended up winning.  What does that say about a game when someone accidently wins when he couldn't follow his desired strategy?

I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would.  Easy to learn, teach, and play, but enough substance to keep it interesting.  I really like the turn/offer mechanism - it's pretty different from other things I've seen.  However, it can be fairly luck dependent - if you have crappy offer cards, it is hard to get into a position to get good cards from others.  But the game is relatively short, so if you get card hosed, oh well.

Like the Tower of Babel this is a fun game that just does not get pulled out all that often. I think some would say that this is part of the glut of Euros that came out that rehashed mechanics and offered nothing really innovative. It is a fun game now and then but who cares - it is not one that you remember with any kind of awe or excitement. That said I have had fun with it and the card play does hold some interest. And the art is well done - nice bits, board and cards.

So glad this hit the table. Very, very enjoyable. Has a slightly San Marco vibe -- not surprising considering it's another Weissblum/Moon game. Some interesting decisions to make offers to lure people into selecting your offer so you can receive greater priority or bonus actions. Specialize in just a few scoring areas, or try to cover all the bases? Keep to yourself, or get into someone else' region? Lots of nice decisions. Biggest downside is I can how a player would regularly be in a position to end the game with his "bonus action" requiring a complete score count *before* the end of the game to see if ending the game will win the game.  [UPDATE] I really, really like Oasis conceptually. I like the offer concept. But, it can be *incredibly* frustrating -- it feels you can be done in by luck of the draw (yours or your opponents') with little room to maneuver or fight back, especially if your one card offer is exactly what the 1st selector needs for a huge score.

I really do not care for the card auction at all.  In order to have a chance at being first (or at least 2nd) you must offer up a nicer set than other people, but due to the randomness of the draw (especially since you can't choose what to give out) you may end up giving more valuable tiles than you receive in the following turn, or the more likely scenario of having crappy selection that no one wants and thus get picked last.  Since you've depleted your deck, you must then set out less in order to refill, so unless you get extremely lucky, you'll spend yet another turn going after everyone else.  The problem is further compounded if people don't learn to play defensively by either denying the cards and/or the priority marker to the one in the lead, even if they have to pick up things they cannot use.

Oasis is too dependent on everyone else to play smart in order for an even-matched game, otherwise it seems like it's easy for one person to run away with it.  The design itself is ok at best, color me unimpressed.

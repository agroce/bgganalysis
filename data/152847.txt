Love the dishonorable/honorable drawing system, though when playing grandmaster mode it seems like there is very little drawback to drawing as many cards as possible (the threat of the orange clan that swaps hands with your opponent is basically the only check on it) because in our two plays, the person who wins the round generally wins in such a blowout that even multiple corruption cards stacked will not make a difference. The deduction elements are interesting as well, but because the number of tokens each player has placed on the boss card is public knowledge, it seems like you can just copy your opponents' plays there and negate the VP from this card, meaning that whomever wins the most rounds is simply going to inevitably win. Will need further plays to see if this is true. Picked up the King Pig promo card @ gencon 2014, who is a much more interesting boss card than the ones included in the box

This game is fun, but the catch up mechanism is weak, and it is very heavily driven by luck. There are not many choices on your turn unless you get lucky and draw good cards.

You pretty much do things repetitively, draw cards and hope the right ones will show up, try to block the NEXT player from winning.

There are so many things wrong with this game.

RATING: 7
Theme is not a winner in Shinobi, which nonetheless is a fun card game with lots of interaction and «take that» situations: unsurprisingly, the advanced game is more challenging and fun than the basic. 

When played with very result-oriented players, the end of each round comes a little too quickly.

RATING: 6
The set collecting and playing were fine. The Grand Master SCoring stuff made the game more complicated, and even a bit more random. I appreciated what they were trying to accomplish with the different end bosses, but I think the grasshopper mode would be where the game should be.

Pretty straight forward set collection and play of that collection game. The ending situation where you defeat a boss monster isn't as varied as I would like it to be, but the heart of the game is in the play of each "game" before that end game result.

Some of the clans seem less impactful on play than others, but overall it's fun.

+ Vastly underrated game.  Solid mechanics, great theme and artwork.
+ I like card games, deck builders, set collection.  This  has basically all of that plus the semi hidden scoring.
- Not a huge fan of the way the boss situation works out.  Not knowing what you'll be up against can be unfairly random.

RATING: 2
This should have been released as a small card game in the form of Guildhall, but instead the extra module for the "full" game just drags it down and makes it a bit of a tedious mess.  Probably worth putting the cards in a deck box, playing the short game and binning the superfluous extras.  Art is great and the component quality is good, although as I touched on above the box should be a quarter of the size it currently is.

Fun little card game! Grasshopper mode was our gaming highlight this weekend! ...Grandmaster mode was ok- I guess it hasn't grown on us just yet. Wouldn't mind playing this one again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The light, take-that portion of the game is fine for what it is -- simple take-that card game. But, the meta game feels...tacked on? It just doesn't make sense and feels very inconsistent. There's also not really a way to make a "good" decision at the end regarding the card that flips and the victory, or loss, just feels cheap. It feels like they took the grasshopper mode and added something on top of it? Not sure it should have been expanded as it was. I'd like to see them do more with just the simple card mechanic.

RATING: 6
Textbook example of 6 score. It is beautiful game, but very flimsy. I will play it from time to time, but it will not be regular on the table.

Kind of not bad enough to get rid of but at the same time not good enough to play regularly.

Rating is for the base game, I have not tried the 'master' version. And I dont really want to to be honest. It felt like the basic premise of Guildhall, with added chaos and less descisions. Very meh. If you like Munchkin style play, you might enjoy it. Artwork is great.

Fun, quick set building game. Can feel rather mean but the playful art (somehow) softens the blow for me. Can be quite swingy but there's a gamemode that allows you to chain three quick rounds together in one big game. That really stops it from feeling too swingy.

The base game (Grasshopper mode) is a light and fun filler, and I'm not sure it's improved upon by the advanced mode which seems to dilute things and change scoring in uninteresting ways. Top notch artwork.

RATING: 5
I did not enjoy the chaos in the game and the take-that aspect, especially the power to "exchange your hand with opponent".  

The only aspect I enjoyed with the deduction of the Boss card in effect, but even that seems counterproductive since you either: spend ninja stars on determining which boss it is or spend ninja stars on the Boss card itself.  It doesn't seem like much strategy choice given that you either (1) you narrow it down to which Boss it is/can be, or (2) just guess and put stars in hopes it scores points versus not put stars in hopes it doesn't score you negative points).  Seem more chaotic than fun but maybe it's just me.

RATING: 6
Don't need to own it but I found the game enjoyable.  It is quite cut-throat at times with take that elements.  The corruption mechanic to draw more cards feels well designed.  The mini shirikens were fun.m there is a bit of a deductive aspect as one attempts to figure out the likely boss villain.

One of my favourite game edited in 2014, it's really fun and allow to fight with ninja clans between friends or family.

The rules are very easy to understand and we can play to the game very quickly. The two game mode are very cool and permit to vary the game pleasures. 

The grand master mode add a very sympathetic phase of bet when you put some tokens on the game board. We have played several times to the game and we're not tired of it, it's a very replayable game and you don't stop after just a single game, everybody around the table wants to take his revenge ^^

Really fun and cool game with magnificent illustrations. Can't wait to get the extension !!

RATING: 6
Really visually appealing. A little annoying that even if you do really well in the rounds, you may not be able to figure out the final boss card and pull ahead. Also, in a 4 player game, can sometimes cause a run-away leader because other players don't earn enough stars to accomplish much.

The comparisons to Guildhall are valid, but I much prefer this one based on theme and artwork alone.  At it's heart it's just an abstract set collection game but I also really enjoy the simple worker placement aspects of grandmaster mode.  Iello is shaping up to be one of my favorite publishers with all of their nice looking, simple, fun games.

RATING: 7.5
Gioco di carte semplice e simpatico. Bisogna collezionare carte uguali (clan) per poterle scartare/giocare, una volta fatta la coppia o il tris potranno essere giocate per attuarne il potere e fare punti. Dopo tre turni verranno calcolati i punti vittoria che saranno un po' sorprendenti. Un gioco dove la fortuna può farla da padrone ma che ha anche la particolarità di tenere celato fino alla fine il reale andamento della partita non permettendo di conoscere i punti vittoria, questo aspetto rende le partite frizzanti, veloci ma al tempo stesso serve un po' di intuito. Titolo carino da giocare un po' di volte. Rende il meglio in 4 giocatori.

This game felt like two games in one. First you play a sort of rummy game to see who gets the most throwing stars for this sort of worker placement portion of the game. It was okay, but I definitely am not running to find a game of this to play. I can take it or leave it.

We had a lot of fun with this game.  I will say that we have had groups that never caught on or just got board, all said and done I enjoyed it, I do tell people that have never played it that they have to say it the right way before we will open the box.  the game is better when everyone screams WAT-AAH!

Great components and absolutely stunning artwork! Grasshopper mode lets the players get the hang of the game, and Grandmaster mode provides a larger level of play. A simple concept that has a funny theme. There are many ways to play the clans, however, some are a lot more useful than others.
Best with 4 players.

Part of me loves this game after one play.  Great clans with interesting quick-playing powers.  Good ascertain-the-enemy strategizing for the endgame.

But I suspect with more plays that the targeted screwage components (choose a player to lose a bunch of cards, choose a player to put a bunch of cards back in his hand...) will ruin this for me.  Far too much kingmaking.

A lot of potential lost here.

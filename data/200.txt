If you like exploration games then this is one of the best. Of course, eploring means the tile draw can make ot break you so make sure you're in the mood to cope with a bit of randomness.

I've had a lot of fun with this family game of exploration. I recommend playing with Mark Johnson's changes found here in the forums. They add a few more interesting elements that make the game all the better. I'm glad to have finally found a tile-placement game that I enjoy.

An area influence game masquerading as an exploration game.  The two aspects are well blended, but never fully.  Game play is fun, but not as solid as one would hope. leaving the players wanting just a little more than it can deliver.  Not a starter, but one to keep in reserve to switch things up from time to time.[GTI Code: TPCL]

Upped my rating to 6 after playing a 3-player game.  (Previously was 4 for a 2-player game.)  I still feel there is a high random element (one guy got screwed twice spending 6 gold to find no playable tiles.  I spent 1 twice and got the tile I needed.)  Will try next time with the rules from the New set.

The similarity of the mechanic is remarkably close to Carcassonne (placing tiles and betting on which areas will grow big), yet somehow it does not work out just as well.

Overall quite disappointing. There must be a good game somewhere beneath the nice material somewhere. (I have not tried the rule variants available here on BGG yet, nor did I try the new edition of the game, which seems to be heavily altered.)

6 plays (1x3p, 5x4p) - Mucho Fun (only using variant rules informed by New Entdecker, like the tile purchasing method (known= 4gold, unknown=1, declare how many of which kind first) and board entry costs (narrow sides 0 and 2 gold to enter, long sides 1 gold).  Roll (using New Entdecker die) if you have 3 or less gold; others receive +1 gold.  Max gold you can hold is 12.  Good puzzle game with light strategy and tactics, some risk-taking and area control.  A hit with some of my friends; we can work through it at a nice snappy pace (1 hour). I made wooden Plant tiles.

RATING: N/A
It is a little fiddly and those special huts seem like the worlds worst game component, but the theme does come out well as it does feel like you are sailing around an island that is unexplored so you don't know if it will be a 6 tile monster or a dinky little 2 tile one.

This game is ok.  The discovery aspect is fun, though the fact that explorers can determine what they discover if they pay enough kind of breaks the illusion.  Ultimately it comes off a bit dry and not as satisfying as you'd like.  Maybe it just needs competition from 4 players (which I'm not sure I've done more than once) for sufficient drama?

As mentioned by Mark Johnson on the 'Boardgames To Go' podcast, this first version of Entedcker is much simpler and quicker to play than the second version (I don't like the huts...).  This is what I was hoping for since I enjoy the exploration aspect of the game and wanted to play it on weeknights after the kids did their homework.  It doesn't matter to me if it's a bit random or unbalanced, I'm playing it to enjoy the theme and the look of the game more than as a serious competition.  The spinner is cool!  Good family game and a pleasure to look at- beautiful blue game.  Deluxe Oceana.

Entdecker can't quite deny its relationship to Carcassonne. As evidence, there is of course the tile-laying itself and the majority scoring on the completed islands. If you like Carcassonne you'll probably also like Entdecker. The latter has a somewhat higher luck factor, though, which can in parts be mitigated by paying more gold. But then it also is a lot shorter.

I recently purchased the original version of Entdecker from a classic games merchant. I've also played the new version of the game. One of my favorite aspects of it is that the board builds as you play - making it a surprising experience every time!

RATING: 6
Good game.  I was a little wary at first; it seemed like an expensive Carcassonne.  But, there are a bunch of clever mechanisms, and it actually doesn't play like Carcassonne much at all.  There is an annoying mechanism where the poorest players remain poorest for quite some time, and I'm not sure if there's a terribly effective way of combating it other than hoarding cash as often as you can.

A really fun exploring game that has a lot of theme.  I love tile laying games so this is a lot of fun for me!

It took me 14 years before I played it. Nowadays, nobody puts it into the Teuber trilogy of Löwenherz, Siedler and Entdecker anymore. Time told us that Siedler was here to stay. Rather it is comparable to Goldland but Entdecker has more luck but at the same time plays lighter and quicker making it the better choice for me.
Recommended rules from the new Entdecker to be used: 
- buy an open tile for 4 gold
- starting discovery from the continent side costs no gold, starting from the long sides costs 1 gold, starting from the opposite side costs 2 gold (optional: pay for opposing pieces between your starting point and the edge of the board)

A tile-laying exploration game. I found the rules for exploring very unintuitive (i.e. those ship lines), and the tile draw to be a little too random for my taste. The game has great art, but component-wise, those cardboard huts were a terrible idea.

I enjoy this game more than Carcassone.  I don't like the mechanic of placing figures from completed islands onto victory point tracks.  In the few games I've played one player is generally left alone while the others have fought for certain tracts.  I know this is not a fault of the game itself but it does allow for it.  There are a lot of path choices so there isn't a tremendous amount of strategy to this game.  I won't usually recommend this because the playtime is too long for a less strategic game.

Fun, light game.  Plays fairly quickly.  Not much player interaction, but the play is so simple and fast that it seems more interactive than it is.  Along with Ticket to Ride and the lengthy Settlers of Catan, one of my preferred entry-level games. EDIT: Elasund (!) has a lot of the feel of Entdecker, but is better, so rating is reduced from a "6".

I was last player in in a four player game and I truly believe that is massive disadvantage.  If you go to an area allready visited . Other players have earlier opportunities to discover it all and win the majority by placing another token there.
The turn order advantage plays for the entire game and I can't seem to find a way to deal with that. 
I had also one turn less in the entire game. The player before me made a huge area unapproachable (area scored 21 points)  . And all players tied or overtook me in that area in that turn.

i rated it a 7 with room for improvement to go up. But because of this disadvantage I can't.

It still gets a six because of the discovery part of the game is well executed.
And probably none of the games will be alike.
If there is no last player disadvantage I would rate this an 8.

This felt rather random due to the highly influential random tile draws.  I think some people received undue advantages, leaving some players well behind, and the final reckoning came down to the luck of the draw as well.  I suppose some of it is manageable, but the game didn't give me a very favorable impression.

Fun enough to keep and play onnce in a while. It differs enough from Settlers and Carcassonne to enjoy it as a change of pace. The game components are good, with some nifty "huts" and the tiles are the nice thick kind (aka Carcassonne). The game has a unique component related to gaining gold, but is otherwise fairly standard.

It's been interesting to see progenitor mechanisms playing 1990s games. 'Ticket to Ride' card drafting in Elfenland. 'Transamerica' route-building in Expedition. And now 'Carcassonne' tile-laying in Entdecker. I enjoyed my play of this, but like a few others of the 90s Euros, it runs a bit long for modern tastes, and it's so similar to Carcassonne that I can't really see needing both.

Let me start by saying it's really a shame how Mayfair decided to butcher this game in the "New Horizons" version by adding those infernal native huts. What were they thinking? They could have at least created a double sided board for original Entdecker on one side. Also, the dice rolling mechanic is much worse than the spinner: the rich getting richer does not help (one player can get stuck in a poverty-stricken tail spin). If I had to guess, Mayfair decided to capitalize on the Settlers of Catan's casual marker by infusing the classic game with even more luck and randomness. More randomness is exactly what this game didn't need! 

Ranting aside, original Entdecker is an excellent game. It holds the honor of being the spiritual forerunner to Carcassonne, and that alone should give it plenty of board game cred. All players control the same ship on the board. Players move the ship, discover, and place tokens on the islands to create influence and gain majorities. It sounds simple, but it's packed with plenty of interesting decisions. There are a few good elements from the new version that can help balance the older: mainly, being able to purchase specific tiles from the face up stack at an increased price. This one fix alone, can solve the end game problem of pouring money into unfruitful discovery.

A great game that could have greatly benefited from an English release. I had a hell of a time trying to decipher the only available poor English translation. I've recently become aware of the Entdecker tile trilogy (I'm not sure it can be called a trilogy if the last game is never released). I'm interested to see how I feel about this game after playing those 2.

Entdecker -- Both this version and the new one (Exploring New Horizons) are great. This is one game where I've decided to own both versions.

I've always particularly enjoyed the Entdecker game engine.  My only complaint has been that games last too long. (A game of such middling depth does not warrant such a long duration.)  

Regardless, I love the sense of discovery these games provide.

So this was a lot of fun! We had great group of people, the game was nice and close (I think I won by just 1 point, with the next two tied for second), I think it was quicker, and it's a fun variant!

A tile game with the same issue as many others. There's a big luck factor in the game. It's important to be present on each island because otherwhise you get to far behind in points and it's hard coming back. 

Will need to play this again and use the variant in wich you get 4 tiles that you can choose from in the game.

The splitting of the manual was a bad idea.

Good, exploration, tile placement, majority control game. Simple but with quite a few options and interesting decisions.

I didn't like the scoring mechanism with the huts, which seemed kind of tacked on.  I felt that I could get all the tile-laying fun in a fraction of the time by playing Carcassonne.

I've played a lot more games than are recorded here. I went through phases with this one - first I loved it because of the map-building, but then I tired of the hut-races. I'm still "meh" on it.

Light explorer game. Nothing special.

Fun tile laying game of exploration, and discovery reminiscent of dungeonquest as tiles taken have to be able to played in specific areas, elements of being very annoying to other players, by stealing points form them.

One of my first euros, but like my first schoolgirl crush, I realize it may not be as great as I once thought

Like the old version a bit better than the new, (damned huts!), though I think some combination will be even better. Lots of poaching, and a lot of neat tile laying. Very reminicent of Carcasonne, with the added needs for money management. A set of bad tile draws will totally screw up your game though...

We played it wrong.  Never went back to try.  I liked it but some stuff just seemed "off".  Need to play again.

A good exploration game.  Only played once, so I my score may change with further playing.

More Competitive with more players. 2 players is awful. Its a lot like Carcossone but with a map so its restricting the growth of the world and also acts as a timer. Spending money to explore is interesting mechanic although I do not like the idea of rolling die to get money as this means your opponents get money too

This was the first German game I bought.  I had played it a few times and ordered it through the game store.  It is still one of my best purchases.  It is a simple, fun game that plays quickly with new and experienced players.  I think it is one of the best gateway games around (yes, even better than Settlers).  I would say, "Buy this game!"
